It will support  this proposal at the second conference of the signatories to the  Basel Convention on dangerous waste. Federal Counselor Ruth  Dreifuss will head the Swiss delegation to this conference which  is to take place from 21-25 March in Geneva, as decided on  Monday by the Federal Council.    The conference will deal mainly with a proposal from Denmark  which aims at banning the export of dangerous waste to Third  World countries, be it for storage or incineration purposes.  Switzerland considers this a reinforcement of the main  objective of the Basel conference on the control of  transnational transport and disposal of dangerous waste. It is  also ready to join OECD countries which no longer export waste  to Third World countries, even for recycling purposes.    According to the Federal Department of the Interior,  Switzerland has not allowed the export of waste to developing  countries since the 1986 regulation on the movement of hazardous  waste was implemented. It virtually initiated the Basel  Convention which came into force on 5 May 1992. The objectives  of this convention proceed along the same lines as the Swiss  strategy: If possible, all waste must be disposed in the  country where it is produced.     "
0,FT924-7565 ,"FT924-7565 _AN-CKPBQABYFT 921116   FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Dangerous Corner - Theatre      By ANDREW ST GEORGE   JB Priestly (1894-1984) wrote his first play, Dangerous Corner, in 1932. England was in recession, unemployment around three million, and society changing rapidly. Under identical circumstances in 1992, Priestly's message holds true: the future must be reworked from the past, learning from mistakes. The Birmingham Rep's production of Dangerous Corner offers a meticulous account of this unquiet comedy thriller, entertaining and instructive. Dangerous Corner belongs with Time and the Conways (1937), An Inspector Calls (1946) and with Anthony Ackland's The Dark River (1939). All are forensic studies of society which start in the present to uncover the past. The production opens with a billowing curtain drawn upward, like a dust sheet, revealing a frozen social tableau. A chance after-dinner remark about a cigarette box leads six upper-middle class characters into a sticky web of connection. They deep question each other into the early hours. All emerge as liars, sometimes pernicious, but more often muddled and confused: 'The real truth is something so deep you can't get at it; all half-truth does is to blow it all up. It isn't civilised.' Priestly contrives a plausible ending by making the news of past events bear on present relationships. But the play commits itself to more than the search for truth, since the action uncovers sex, drugs, greed and hatred beneath the sober patina of polite society. It amounts to social archaeology. Just as Priestly's English Journey (1934) found old England in York and Durham, Victorian England in Manchester, and post-war England in filling stations and cigarette coupons, so Dangerous Corner finds women's sexuality in an after-dinner smile, new commercial attitudes in the flourish of a dress, old values in a formal goodnight. Robert Jones' excellent design is a simple drawing-room with the Priestly essentials: whisky and a way out to the conservatory. Gwenda Hughes's direction misses the fun and cliche embedded in the play, and takes itself too seriously: one woman returns to the party, convinced she is being talked about; an outraged hostess awaits her husband's crooked business partner with 'he'll get no sandwiches from me'. The acting of Marilyn Cutts, Graham Padden and David Hobbs catches some of Priestly's wit; the other actors have yet to find the right tone. Priestly offers a quiet coda, repeating the first scene, in which the casual question which started the previous three acts is deftly turned aside, a road not taken. It is a witty turn into a social rather than philosophical definition of truth. But then, even serious philosophers can be distracted: Bertrand Russell once asked GE Moore, 'Do you always tell the truth?' Moore replied, 'No.' Russell recalled: 'That was the only lie I ever knew him to tell.' Birmingham Rep (021 236 4455)  The Financial Times   London Page 11  "

The bills were passed without any discussion as the  opposition continued to boycott the session.    Stating the objective of the dangerous drugs bill, the  Interior Minister said it has been tabled to check the menace of  trafficking of narcotic drugs which has assumed alarming  situation in the recent years. It is expedient to award capital  punishment to the criminals involved in offences relating to  trafficking, or financing the trafficking of heroin or cocaine  or opium or coca leaf, import into Pakistan, export from  Pakistan, import or export inter-provincially.    The Minister said the bill seeks to achieve that object by  amending relevant provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930,  to provide death penalty and also to raise the minimum  punishment of imprisonment.    In order to prevent the narcotics smugglers from benefiting  out of the illegal gains, acquired through narcotics  trafficking, the bill further seeks to achieve this objective by  amending relevant provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930,  to provide for forfeiture of assets of a person convicted for  two years or more. Later the House adopted the bill.    The Interior Minister also tabled another bill titled as The  Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd Amendment) Bill, 1994, for  passage.    While stating the objective of this bill, the Minister said  the expression ""raw opium"" has not been defined in The  Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979 which resulted  into release of accused. The Federal Shariat Court and the High  Courts have, therefore, desired an appropriate amendment in the  statute, the Minister added. The House passed the amended bill  with voice vote.    The House also adopted the Anti-Narcotic Task Force Bill,  1993 which provides for the constitution of anti-narcotics task  force.    Describing the objectives of the bill, the Interior Minister  said that with a view to inquiring into and investigating all  offences relating to, or connected with, preparation,  production, manufacture, transportation, trafficking or  smuggling of intoxicants, narcotics and chemicals, precursors or  reagents used in the manufacture of narcotics or dangerous drugs  or assets derived therefrom, the Federal government decided to  constitute an anti- narcotics task force, and empower its  members with necessary legal powers for the aforesaid purpose.    He said the bill seeks the necessary legal frame work for  constitution of the said anti-narcotics task force, by the  Federal Government and empower its members with such powers,  including the powers relating to search, arrest of persons or  seizure of property and such duties, privileges and liabilities,  as a police officer has in respect of offences under the Code of  Criminal procedure, 1898 or any other law for the time being in  force.

0,FT943-928 ,"FT943-928 _AN-EI0DNADAFT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / Arts: Dangerous Liaisons - Opera in San Francisco      By TIMOTHY PFAFF   Two centuries and numerous stage and screen adaptations later, The Dangerous Liaisons emerged in a new incarnation as The San Francisco Opera mounted the world premiere of Conrad Susa's and librettist Philip Littell's opera. It is baffling that the company commissioned Susa to create its first full-scale premiere in 18 years. It had previously produced two Susa operas for a spring season (Transformations) and for its apprentice singers (The Love of Don Perlimplin), neither of which proved musically memorable occasions. While Liaisons, now being filmed for television, may well prove more memorable, its musically faceless score is unlikely to linger long in the mind. Ironically, for an opera about people obsessed with appearances and style, Susa's score is virtually devoid of a unifying musical style - or even personality. The orchestral carpet is a tangle of meandering sounds and the vocal writing lacks tension, shape, and even a rudimentary sense of direction. But for all that, San Francisco's expert cast, headed by Frederica von Stade as the Marquise de Merteuil and Thomas Hampson as the Vicomte de Valmont, took to the vocal parts as if they were top-drawer Verdi. Strangely, the most obvious blemish on Susa's score, its orchestration, may not represent his own work. The programme discreetly identified Donald Ontiveros, Manly Romero, and an entity called Music Publications Technologies under a new category, 'Orchestration and editorial assistance.' And in the weeks preceding the premiere there were rumours of other people, with the requisite musical acumen (or the right software), orchestrating this passage or that. Music director Donald Runnicles lent his customary tireless energy and cogent leadership to the enterprise, but there is a limit to what even a music director can ask. In most other respects, the makings of a promising opera seemed on hand. Littell's English verse libretto - drawn directly from the Pierre Choderlos de Laclos novel - proved serviceable, although Susa's heavy hand with the musical applique did make one grateful for the surtitles. Production director Colin Graham cleverly realised the letter motif that underlies every aspect of this complex tale and effectively staged the overlapping of scenes, characters, and even time and space frames that are at the heart of Littell's play. Resident designer Gerard Howland's fluid settings and costumes unearthed subtle connections within the overall picture of decadent beauty. And Thomas Munn's lighting was dramatic and narrative in its own right. All that said, it was the cast that made the work as involving as it became. (Subject matter notwithstanding, the long first act was simply dull.) As the Marquise de Merteuil, Frederica von Stade was formidable and husky of tone one minute, vulnerable and kittenish the next, and typically - but arrestingly - sympathetic in her portrayal. Thomas Hampson's Valmont was similarly fine-grained, convincingly sinister and susceptible without once defaulting to stage cliche. Renee Fleming's melting, then molten, performance as the tormented Madame de Tourvel took over the second act, as it should. Judith Forst's imperious Madame de Volanges, Mary Mills' complex and affecting Cecile, and Johanna Meier's worldly-wise Madame de Rosemond were accomplished, affecting musical characterisations. Australian tenor David Hobson's Danceny was convincingly hormonal but had yet to come into focus. The comprimario roles were played faultlessly. Despite the cumulative theatrical power of this Liaison's second act, it is so musically evanescent as to become, in the end, insubstantial and unmemorable. As currently scored, Conrad Susa's The Dangerous Liaisons becomes the latest entrant in a dispiriting string of American opera premieres. In a savagely defiant final tableau, von Stade's Merteuil - in a harsh caricature of Strauss' Capriccio Countess departing for a dinner of Weltschmerz - exits with the raspy, vulgar exclamation, 'I'm hungry.' So, it happens, are we.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P7922 Theatrical Producers and Services.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.  The Financial Times   London Page 17  "

Available information indicates that Lebanese, Palestinians,  and four other people in one of the largest southern cities in  Lebanon, who graduated from Russian universities, have managed  to transport the red mercury substance and sell it in Lebanon.  This substance is one of the most dangerous kinds used in the  production of nuclear bombs. Western scientists say only Russia  has this substance and knows how to manufacture it in various  sizes. Its size could equal that of a hand grenade or a little  smaller.    U.S. security men, internationally specialized in tracking  down this substance, have arrived in Lebanon to keep under close  surveillance several members of the group that smuggled the  substance. A quantity of three kg of red mercury has been  seized.    As a result of expanding trade, a senior Russian Army  officer  has offered to market three kg of red mercury for $30,000.    Thus, this substance was exported to one of the ports of the  large southern Lebanese cities as part of trade commodities in a  truck.    Information indicates there have been many attempts to  market  and sell this substance on the Lebanese market, and even in the  Middle East. However, the dearth of information about this  substance and the lack of ideas about its importance and how to  use it prevented its marketing and trading. Search is now under  way in more than one Arab and foreign capital, as reported by  Russian security agencies, especially a high-level official who  arrived in the Middle East and revealed the smuggling of the red  mercury from Russia to Lebanon. The search is aimed at finding  out whether this quantity is the only amount that leaked from  Russia through this officer to Lebanese and Palestinian people  and whether there are other people in other countries who have  acquired this substance and what happened to the substance. The  nature and shape of the substance do not particularly attract  the attention of scientists and laboratory owners, since it is a  white substance that looks like fine sugar and its importance  and effectiveness have so far not been publicized.

Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except Federal   holidays.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), is the agency within the DOT that has been delegated with the responsibility of developing and promulgating regulatory requirements for the transportation of hazardous materials. The RSPA has issued regulations which identify, define, describe and classify hazardous materials. These requirements are codified, generally, in the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) at 49 CFR Parts 171 through 180. The responsibility for enforcement of certain aspects of the HMR is delegated to the appropriate modal Administration, and for highways, this responsibility rests with the FHWA. The FHWA consistently incorporates hazardous materials terminology, descriptions, and classifications that are promulgated by the RSPA into the FMCSR, as appropriate, in order to maintain uniformity between the requirements of the HMR and the requirements of the FMCSR.        The RSPA published a final rule on December 21, 1990 (55 FR 52402), entitled Performance-Oriented Packaging Standards; Changes to Classification, Hazard Communication, Packaging and Handling Requirements, Based on United Nations' Standards and Agency Initiative. This rule comprehensively amended the hazardous materials communication requirements in the HMR, based upon the United Nations' Recommendations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods, which are codified at 49 CFR Part 107 through 180. Descriptions of certain hazardous materials currently found in Parts 387, 391, 392, and 397 are incompatible with the RSPA's final rule which incorporated certain aspects of the United Nations' Recommendations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods, into the HMR, now codified at 49 CFR Parts 171180. Hazardous materials such as explosives, poison gases, and radioactive materials heretofore have been classified in the FMCSR using the descriptive language and regulatory requirements of Parts 171 through 177 of the HMR, that were in effect prior to the implementation of the United Nations' Recommendations. Therefore, in order to effectively carry out its responsibility for enforcement of certain parts of the HMR, the FHWA has initiated these technical amendments to the FMCSR to provide for regulatory consistency and uniformity.     Minimum Levels of Financial Responsibility for Motor Carriers, 49 CFR Part 387, was published in the     Federal Register     on June 11, 1981 (46 FR 3097430987). This part set forth requirements for motor carriers transporting non-hazardous property, and/or hazardous materials or substances, to maintain minimum levels of financial responsibility. The levels of financial responsibility vary, depending upon whether the cargo being transported is a non-hazardous material, or a hazardous material.    Qualifications of drivers, 49 CFR Part 391, was published in the     Federal Register     on April 22, 1970 (35 FR 6460). The requirements in this part establish minimum qualification standards for drivers who drive motor vehicles as, or for a motor carrier engaged in interstate commerce. This part includes limited exceptions for drivers who are otherwise qualified and regularly employed, and were hired before July 1, 1975. A driver is not subject to the requirements of this part if the driver continues regular employment, is transporting certain material considered to be hazardous, and transports that hazardous material in     Intra-    state commerce.    Driving of Motor Vehicles, 49 CFR Part 392, was published in the     Federal Register     on December 25, 1968 (33 FR 19732). Among other things, this part requires drivers who drive a motor vehicle to stop at all railroad grade crossings, and to utilize, in lieu of flame producing devices, emergency reflective triangles or other such devices, when transporting certain types of hazardous materials.    Transportation of Hazardous Materials; Driving and Parking Rules, 49 CFR Part 397, was published in the     Federal Register     on March 13, 1971 (36 FR 4876). This part requires motor carriers to have in place various procedures, policies, and documents during the transportation of hazardous materials by motor vehicle. Part 397 classified hazardous materials using the descriptive language and regulatory requirements of the HMR. These classifications, in place since 1971, included explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizing materials, and gases.     The FHWA is making appropriate conforming changes to 49 CFR Parts 387, 391, 392, and 397 of the FMCSR, that reference any hazardous material classification or description, based upon the United Nations' Recommendations, the RSPA's adoption of changes to the HMR reflective of these recommendations, and the need for international uniformity of these regulations. In addition, the FHWA is appropriately making nomenclature changes in 49 CFR Part 387 of the FMCSR, to indicate that all references made to the ``Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety'', will now read, the ``Federal Highway Administration.'' All text references in Part 387 referencing the ``Bureau'' will read the ``FHWA.''

Descriptions of certain hazardous materials currently found in Parts 387, 391, 392, and 397 are incompatible with the RSPA's final rule which incorporated certain aspects of the United Nations' Recommendations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods, into the HMR, now codified at 49 CFR Parts 171180. Hazardous materials such as explosives, poison gases, and radioactive materials heretofore have been classified in the FMCSR using the descriptive language and regulatory requirements of Parts 171 through 177 of the HMR, that were in effect prior to the implementation of the United Nations' Recommendations. Therefore, in order to effectively carry out its responsibility for enforcement of certain parts of the HMR, the FHWA has initiated these technical amendments to the FMCSR to provide for regulatory consistency and uniformity.     Minimum Levels of Financial Responsibility for Motor Carriers, 49 CFR Part 387, was published in the     Federal Register     on June 11, 1981 (46 FR 3097430987). This part set forth requirements for motor carriers transporting non-hazardous property, and/or hazardous materials or substances, to maintain minimum levels of financial responsibility. The levels of financial responsibility vary, depending upon whether the cargo being transported is a non-hazardous material, or a hazardous material.    Qualifications of drivers, 49 CFR Part 391, was published in the     Federal Register     on April 22, 1970 (35 FR 6460). The requirements in this part establish minimum qualification standards for drivers who drive motor vehicles as, or for a motor carrier engaged in interstate commerce. This part includes limited exceptions for drivers who are otherwise qualified and regularly employed, and were hired before July 1, 1975. A driver is not subject to the requirements of this part if the driver continues regular employment, is transporting certain material considered to be hazardous, and transports that hazardous material in     Intra-    state commerce.    Driving of Motor Vehicles, 49 CFR Part 392, was published in the     Federal Register     on December 25, 1968 (33 FR 19732). Among other things, this part requires drivers who drive a motor vehicle to stop at all railroad grade crossings, and to utilize, in lieu of flame producing devices, emergency reflective triangles or other such devices, when transporting certain types of hazardous materials.    Transportation of Hazardous Materials; Driving and Parking Rules, 49 CFR Part 397, was published in the     Federal Register     on March 13, 1971 (36 FR 4876). This part requires motor carriers to have in place various procedures, policies, and documents during the transportation of hazardous materials by motor vehicle. Part 397 classified hazardous materials using the descriptive language and regulatory requirements of the HMR. These classifications, in place since 1971, included explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizing materials, and gases.     The FHWA is making appropriate conforming changes to 49 CFR Parts 387, 391, 392, and 397 of the FMCSR, that reference any hazardous material classification or description, based upon the United Nations' Recommendations, the RSPA's adoption of changes to the HMR reflective of these recommendations, and the need for international uniformity of these regulations. In addition, the FHWA is appropriately making nomenclature changes in 49 CFR Part 387 of the FMCSR, to indicate that all references made to the ``Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety'', will now read, the ``Federal Highway Administration.'' All text references in Part 387 referencing the ``Bureau'' will read the ``FHWA.''          "

EC sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles (up to 5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) are forecast to fall by 7.5 per cent this year to 12.84m from 13.9m in 1992, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The German vehicle market is expected to suffer one of the sharpest declines, with a fall in sales of around 10 per cent. EC governments should offer subsidies and tax incentives to stimulate sales of electric cars, according to a report by members of the European Parliament. The report calls for action to encourage a switch to 'cleaner' cars in order to ease the burden placed by exhaust emissions on towns and cities. The report claims that an achievable target for the use of electric cars in towns is 7 per cent of total vehicle volume by 2002. Studies show that 80 per cent of car journeys cover fewer than seven miles, says the report. Most electric cars would have a range of between 70 and 140 miles before batteries needed recharging.

A police source said Christopher Moore, 23, accompanied by  his attorney, turned himself in to the police and was arrested  and charged with possession of ganja, dealing in and taking  steps to export the drug.    Moore, son of Charles Moore who owns Moore's Transport Ltd.,  on Hagley Park Road, St. Andrew, is booked to appear in the  Kingston Criminal Court at Sutton Street this morning.       A Link    Moore's arrest is linked to the arrest Wednesday of Bryan  Bernal, the 20-year-old son of Jamaica's Ambassador to the  United States, Dr. Richard Bernal, and a juvenile relative, for  breaches of the Dangerous Drugs Act.    The young men were held with 45.45 kilograms of ganja  disguised as pineapple juice as they were being processed to  leave the Norman Manley International Airport for Washington D.C.    However, they contend that they were given the tins, packed  into two cartons, to deliver to the relative of an acquaintance  in Washington D.C. The police had been trying to find the person  who allegedly gave the young men the contraband.    In the meantime, the after-dark bail Wednesday of Bryan  Bernal and a juvenile relative has raised many eyebrows in legal  circles.       Unprecedented    Lawyers say it is unprecedented that persons charged in  connection with the trafficking of significant amounts of drugs  be offered ""station"" bail.    Although the police have the power to grant bail, they  invariably remand persons caught attempting to smuggle drugs and  allow the court to decide if bail should be granted and in what  amount.    Alleged traffickers, mostly foreigners have consistently  been  denied bail in the past, but some Jamaicans whose attorneys have  been able to convince the court that they will turn up for their  trial have been offered bail, usually with conditions attached,  such as surrendering travel documents and reporting to the  police each week.    At Hunt's Bay Police Station Bryan Bernal and the other  accused were each offered $500,000 bail Wednesday night.    They were freed on bail, about 10 hours after they were held  with the drug packed into 96 tins, labelled pineapple juice,  among their luggage.    When they appeared in the Kingston Criminal Court at Sutton  Street yesterday, Resident Magistrate Norma Von Cork extended  their bail until next Thursday, April 14.    Their Jamaican passports were seized as a condition of bail.    An application by defence counsel Richard Small for the two  to be given permission to return to the United States to  continue their studies was turned down by the magistrate. Mr.  Small submitted that Bryan, an architectural student, was due to  sit examinations this month.    Mr. Small and attorney-in-law Stephen Shelton are appearing  for the accused. Clerk of the Courts Linda Wright is  representing the Crown.     "

The proposed hard-hitting anti-drug legislation, which is  designed to give ""teeth"" to the existing Dangerous Drugs Act  1991 will give powers to Police, Customs and Coast Guard  officers to seize cash being imported or exported; to stop,  board, search, detain, or divert ships; to arrest without  warrant; and to appoint civilians to assist with drug busts at  sea.    The Bill was laid quietly in the Senate on Monday while the  Upper House was engaged in debate on the Petrotrin merger and in  the Lower House on Friday during the Budget Debate. A limited  number of copies was distributed only to members of both Houses.    The Bill is closely patterned after the British Criminal  Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990, which was  specially drafted to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the  1988 United Nations (Vienna) Convention Against Illicit Traffic  in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Even so, a few  sections which are important for the investigation of money  laundering activities in the UK have been omitted from the local  Bill.    The proposed amendments would improve on existing  legislation  by expressly making money laundering an offence--laundering  one's own drug money is still legal in this country according to  the 1991 Act.    The Government hopes that new laws would remove existing  impediments to the prosecution of drug offenders, and cure  deficiencies related to the confiscation and forfeiture (by  local and foreign courts) of the proceeds of drug trafficking.    If accepted and passed by the required special majority of  three-fifths of the members of each House, the Bill could prove  to be a major tool in the war against financiers and  beneficiaries of the drug trade.    It makes extensive provisions for the execution of  confiscation orders, whether made by local or foreign courts.  This is hoped to reap heavy financial benefits from nationals  convicted of drug trafficking in foreign countries.    It provides for onward extradition, in which a person's  return to a foreign territory shall not be debarred only because  the person will be sent from that territory to another, to stand  trial for an offence.    This clause attempts to rectify a deficiency in existing law  which led to the freeing of three Trinidadians in 1986, after  attempts to have them extradited to England failed because they  were really wanted in connection with a heroin-trafficking  operation in the Golden Triangle.    An offence of conspiracy to commit drug-related offences has  been created under the proposed legislation. Any person who  aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of any offence  under the Act would also be guilty of an offence and is to be  liable on conviction to the same penalty as the principal  offender.    The proposed Bill targets those who work for drug barons by  laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking, with intent to help  the trafficker to elude prosecution for a drug trafficking  offence, or avoid the enforcement of a confiscation order in  respect of his illegally acquired proceeds.    It provides for the prosecution of those who conceal or  disguise property derived from the proceeds of drug trafficking.  Anyone who converts, transfers or disposes of that property, or  removes it from the jurisdiction to assist the trafficker, is  also guilty of an offence and can be fined between $50,000 and  $100,000 and imprisoned for five to 10 years.    Unlike the British Act, however, the local Bill does not  make  the concealing of information (or providing false information)  about money laundering an offence. Under the British Act,  references to concealing or disguising property include  references to concealing or disguising the nature, source,  location, disposition, movement or ownership or any rights with  respect to the ""laundered"" property.    The local Bill provides a kind of amnesty for professionals  (bankers and attorneys, for example) involved in laundering  money for traffickers if they voluntarily disclose information  about the illegal activity. This is subject to conditions that  the disclosure is made before the act is done and the act is  done with the consent of a police officer, or the disclosure is  made after he does the act, but on his initiative and as soon as  it is reasonable for him to make it.    The local Bill also makes it an offence for a person to  receive, possess or convert money or property, knowing that such  money or property was derived from drug trafficking activities.  This clause targets those who provide services or goods which  are of assistance to the trafficker in his illegal activities;  or those who knowingly purchase property for ""next to nothing""  or accept gifts from drug barons. It is a defence under the Bill  to prove that the property was acquired for adequate  consideration (equal to the market value of the property).    One of the more far-reaching clauses gives a Customs or  Police officer the authority to seize and detain any cash being  imported or exported, if he has reasonable grounds for  suspecting that it directly or indirectly represents any  person's proceeds of, or is intended to be used in any drug  transaction.    This clause seeks to trap hundreds of people who pass  through  the airports and other ports each year, carrying large sums of  local and foreign currency.    In previous years, anyone found carrying cash exceeding  limits stipulated by Central Bank's foreign exchange policy,  could have been arrested and charged under the Customs Act. But  since the dollar was floated in April this year, law enforcement  officers have had no jurisdiction to even question the origin of  huge sums of currency.    Under the proposed laws, seized cash can be held for an  initial 48-hour period, but its continued detention can be  authorised by a magistrate. The detention order can only last  for three months at a time, but can be renewed and have effect  for up to two years once the magistrate is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds for the suspicion that the money is  drug-related and that the detention is justified while the  origin or derivation of the cash is further investigated.

0,FT934-12334 ,"FT934-12334 _AN-DJ0CNADQFT 931027   FT  27 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Volvo   The relationship between Volvo and Renault was originally conceived as an equal partnership, so the irritation of some of Volvo's small shareholders at getting a mere 35 per cent of the merged company is understandable. The intervening three years may have seen Volvo's position deteriorate, but the benefits of cost cutting and krona devaluation are just starting to show. Meanwhile, Renault is hurtling headlong into the continental car pile up. Volvo's management may argue that Renault's recent poor profit figures should not determine the shape of the merger, but at least part of Volvo's misfortune is equally short term. For all their ire, Volvo's small shareholders are unlikely to force better terms. This far, Volvo has had the better of the deal, since it has reaped Renault's economies of scale in car component sourcing. Nor, given the astronomical cost of model development, is it credible for Volvo to continue alone forever. The merger is Volvo's least bad alternative. Whether the expanded group can be made to work is, however, another question. Most of the planned cost savings would have been achieved without merger. Now they must be carried through at the same time as the organisations are combined and pruned. There is justified suspicion that deeper cuts and more rationalisation will follow if Renault-Volvo is to avoid dis-economies of scale. Handling that integration is a real management challenge, and the history of automotive mergers from British Leyland through Fiat Lancia to Peugeot Talbot can hardly encourage the newlyweds.

It turns out that, in addition to household installations,  collective purification installations are being set up for  hospitals, cafes, or organizations wishing to provide their  staff with good water. The Polimersintez Scientific Production  Association [NPO], in particular, is manufacturing such devices.  The developers have given one of their products as a gift to  Vladimir Lying-in Hospital No. 2. By the way, the Rucheek-1S and  the Rucheek-2S household water purifiers, which we had mentioned  in a previous publication, already have certificates of  compliance, so that now only the price can be a cause for  reflection for a purchaser.  `` Most of the inhabitants of our planet are aware of the  necessity of purifying water'', says Corresponding Member of the  Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Yu. Rakhmanin, Chief of the  Laboratory of Drinking Water Supply of the Sysyn Scientific  Research Institute of Ecology and Environmental Hygiene.    Yuriy Antonevich, chief of the water country, as his  instrument developers jokingly call him, as he is the chief  expert of the WHO on water supply questions, knows everything  there is to know about water purifiers, all the more so since  domestic water purifiers undergo testing in his laboratory. He  divides these devices into two generations.    Devices based on the principle of filtration or absorption  purification belong to the first. These instruments have one  essential deficiency: they only partially reduce the bacterial  and chemical contamination of the water. The best-known  representative of filters of this type is the Rodnichok. They  also include the TRosaU of both modifications, the TMechtaU, and  the TKolokolchikU.    A whole collection of water purifying devices has been  gathered in Professor Rakhmanin's laboratory, from individual  devices, in the form of a small tube, through which one can  drink water from any source on a hike, to stationary devices,  installed in kindergartens, hospitals, and cafes. The individual  filters have proven to be better than foreign ones in  effectiveness, although more poorly designed: the service life  is three times longer, and in addition they kill viruses. The  individual filter, RodnikS, of the All-Union Scientific Research  Institute of Medical Polymers [VNIIMEDPOLIMER] was in its time  even awarded a prize of the Council of Ministers of the former  Soviet Union. All of these are water purifiers of the second  generation, in which complete decontamination of the water of  both viruses and bacteria and agents of the parasitic diseases  is ensured through iodine-containing reagents.    But there are no analogs of this device in the world, says  the professor, pointing to a light plastic cylinder with an  intake tube attached to the valve, and an output tube delivering  prepared water.    The device is called the Izumrud. And it purifies water on  the basis of an entirely different principle, through  electrolysis. In it water passes through three stages of  purification. First it is subjected to anodic oxidation;  micro-organisms and organic and other contaminants are  decomposed in the process. Then compounds of active chloride are  destroyed, and finally neutralization of heavy metal ions takes  place in the anodic chamber; these become nontoxic, harmless for  man. Electrochemical activation does not simply purify water, it  makes it, in the words of the development engineers of the  Russian-American Emerald company, active; this is living water,  close in quality to spring water or to the melt water of  glaciers. And such water is especially useful.      "

Skillius said that 103 states have already prohibited  importing dangerous waste, among others Hungary, Poland,  Lithuania and Latvia.    Head of Estonian Green Movement Baltic Sea Bureau Valdur  Lahtvee said that as Estonia has no such law, problems with  dangerous waste being imported with uncertain aims have already  risen, quoting an incident two years ago when Asian Trade Gmbh  and its Estonian partner United Products imported great numbers  of used tyres which for an unclear reason caught fire. He also  said that at present a cooperation project with Finnish Kemira  to produce water purification coagulate was under way, in the  course of which dangerous titanium oxyde waste is to be imported.

They apparently regard requirements to supply safe goods, to warn purchasers about any particular risks, to investigate complaints and to recall dangerous products as 'costly and onerous'. It is not one that we share. It is true that the European General Product Safety Directive provides (to us, welcome) additional protection for consumers, although the UK is unlikely to take up all the powers which the directive sets out. But it is also good news for reputable UK manufacturers, because their European competitors will now be subject to similar obligations to those set out in the UK's 1987 Consumer Protection Act. Dangerous products cross frontiers and this legislation is a boost for consumers for fair competition and for the single market.

This exempts the described vehicles with selected cargo from the axle and Bridge Formula weight limits that Maryland must enforce on Interstate Route 68 in Allegany and Garrett Counties. However, the normal gross weight limit (80,000 pounds) remains in effect. This change is adopted by this final rule in 658.17(j).           Reassignment of Size and Weight Responsibilities Within the FHWA           On October 1, 1991, responsibility for the vehicle Size and Weight and NN Programs in the FHWA's regional and divisional offices was transferred to the Office of Motor Carriers. Revisions to 23 CFR 657.11 and 657.17 were proposed in the SNPRM to reflect this change.       No comments were received on this issue. This final rule includes the changes as proposed.       Size and weight responsibilities in the Washington, DC., Headquarters office remain assigned to the Office of Motor Carriers.           Rulemaking Analyses and Notices           This final rule implements sections 1023 and 4006 of the ISTEA, which restrict the operation of LCV's on the Interstate Highway System and CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units on the NN to the type of vehicles in use on or before June 1, 1991, subject to whatever State rules, regulations, or restrictions were in effect on that date.         As noted in the following paragraphs, the FHWA has determined that this rulemaking is: (1) Not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866; (2) not a significant action within the meaning of Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; (4) does not require the preparation of a federalism assessment; and (5) does not require the preparation of an environmental impact statement. All of these findings were made and included in the NPRM and again in the SNPRM, in each case after the FHWA had carefully reviewed the applicable Federal statutes and Executive Orders.       The WTA submitted comments to the docket in response to both the NPRM and the SNPRM challenging what it saw as the FHWA's casual dismissal of determinations required by various statutes and Executive Orders. In comments on the NPRM, the WTA argued that a long-term effect of any freeze would be to prohibit the natural evolution of technology in the trucking industry. Such a situation, in turn, would be likely to cause major and significant impacts on competing transportation modes, related businesses, and the general public. Accordingly, the WTA insisted that the FHWA conduct (1) a full regulatory evaluation, (2) a full economic assessment, (3) a federalism assessment, and (4) an environmental impact study.           Effects on Small Entities and Other Economic Issues           After undertaking the analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601612), the FHWA reiterated in the SNPRM its conclusion that this rulemaking would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This conclusion remains unchanged in this final rule. The WTA, responding to an earlier document, stated that ``there is no question that the form and substance of this NPRM are clearly harmful to small entities. Most businesses affected in Wyoming are small entities. The few large entities doing business in Wyoming are similarly adversely affected.''          "

0,FT942-2898 ,"FT942-2898 _AN-EFQDGACCFT 940617   FT  17 JUN 94 / World Trade News: China seeks to boost vehicle parts sector      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   China will give preference to foreign automobile manufacturers who demonstrate their commitment by launching vehicle component projects to satisfy the country's huge demand for components and spare parts. Mr Ye Qing, vice-director of the State Planning Commission, yesterday outlined conditions for the entry of foreign carmakers after a freeze expires on new manufacturers at the end of next year. 'All things being equal priority will be given to foreign partners who have shown good co-operation in the spare and component parts fields,' Mr Ye told reporters. China has not yet officially unveiled its new Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry (IPAI), but companies such as Toyota and Mitsubishi, Ford and General Motors have been informed they have been excluded from establishing assembly plants until 1996 at the earliest. Beijing has made it clear that it wants investment in its components sector which is backward, fragmented and inadequate for the demands of a modern automotive industry. The car giants, who have been slow to take advantage of opportunities in China, are being told effectively they have to prove themselves by going into the components business. Most of the big car makers are presently investigating possibilities, including seeking joint venture partners in components manufacturing. Foreign manufacturers who established an early presence in China such as Volkswagen have been accorded a significant windfall under the present freeze on entrants to the ranks of international companies involved in assembly. Mr Ye confirmed reports in the Chinese press that Beijing would establish three automotive conglomerates based on the Ist Auto Works in Changchun in north China where the the Audi and Jetta cars are being assembled; Shanghai where the VW Santana is being produced; and the 2nd Auto Works near Wuhan in Hubei province where the Citroen ZX small car is being assembled. China produced some 300,000 passenger vehicles last year and imported another 100,000. The country plans to be producing some 1.5m vehicles by the end of the decade.

0," FR940725-0-00184   FR940725-0-00019        1.     Temperature.     Higher temperatures will cause a combustible or flammable liquid to vaporize at a faster rate than lower temperatures. This is important since hotter days may cause tank residues to produce more vapors and that may result in the vapors exceeding 10 percent of the LEL or an overexposure to toxic contaminants.   2.     Work in the tank.     Any activity in the tank could change the atmospheric conditions in that tank. Oxygen from a leaking oxyfuel hose or torch could result in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere that would more easily propagate a flame. Some welding operations use inert gas, and leaks can result in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. Manual tank cleaning with high pressure spray devices can stir up residues and result in exposures to toxic contaminants. Simple cleaning or mucking out, where employees walk through and shovel residues and sludge, can create a change in atmospheric conditions.   3.     Period of time elapsed.     If a period of time has elapsed since a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person has certified a tank as safe, the atmospheric condition should be rechecked by the competent person prior to entry and starting work.   4.     Unattended tanks or spaces.     When a tank or space has been tested and declared safe, then subsequently left unattended for a period of time, it should be retested prior to entry and starting work. For example, when barges are left unattended at night, unidentified products from another barge are sometimes dumped into their empty tanks. Since this would result in a changed atmosphere, the tanks should be retested prior to entry and starting work.   5.     Work break.     When workers take a break or leave at the end of the shift, equipment sometimes is inadvertently left in the tanks. At lunch or work breaks and at the end of the shift are the times when it is most likely someone will leave a burning or cutting torch in the tank, perhaps turned on and leaking oxygen or an inert gas. Since the former can produce an oxygen-enriched atmosphere, and the latter an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, tanks should be checked for equipment left behind, and atmosphere, monitored if necessary prior to re-entering and resuming work. In an oxygen-enriched atmosphere, the flammable range is severely broadened. This means that an oxygen-enriched atmosphere can promote very rapid burning.   6.     Ballasting or trimming.     Changing the position of the ballast, or trimming or in any way moving the vessel so as to expose cargo that had been previously trapped, can produce a change in the atmosphere of the tank. The atmosphere should be retested after any such move and prior to entry or work.       Section 1915.14 (a) and (b)Hot work.     This is a reminder that other sections of the OSHA shipyard safety and health standards in part 1915 should be reviewed prior to starting any hot work. Most notably, Subpart D, Welding, Cutting and Heating, places additional restrictions on hot work: The requirements of 1915.51 and 1915.53 must be met before hot work is begun on any metal that is toxic or is covered by a preservative coating respectively; the requirements of 1915.54 must be met before welding, cutting, or heating is begun on any structural voids.       Section 1915.12(a)(2).     During hot work, more than 20.8 percent oxygen by volume can be unsafe since it extends the normal flammable range. The standard permits the oxygen level to reach 22 percent by volume in order to account for instrument error. However, the cause of excess oxygen should be investigated and the source removed.       Section 1915.16(b).     If the entire vessel has been found to be in the same condition, then employers shall be considered to be in compliance with this requirement when signs using appropriate warning language in accordance with 1915.16(a) are posted at the gangway and at all other means of access to the vessel.       Appendix B to Subpart B"," FR940725-0-00184   FR940725-0-00019        1.     Temperature.     Higher temperatures will cause a combustible or flammable liquid to vaporize at a faster rate than lower temperatures. This is important since hotter days may cause tank residues to produce more vapors and that may result in the vapors exceeding 10 percent of the LEL or an overexposure to toxic contaminants.   2.     Work in the tank.     Any activity in the tank could change the atmospheric conditions in that tank. Oxygen from a leaking oxyfuel hose or torch could result in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere that would more easily propagate a flame. Some welding operations use inert gas, and leaks can result in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. Manual tank cleaning with high pressure spray devices can stir up residues and result in exposures to toxic contaminants. Simple cleaning or mucking out, where employees walk through and shovel residues and sludge, can create a change in atmospheric conditions.   3.     Period of time elapsed.     If a period of time has elapsed since a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person has certified a tank as safe, the atmospheric condition should be rechecked by the competent person prior to entry and starting work.   4.     Unattended tanks or spaces.     When a tank or space has been tested and declared safe, then subsequently left unattended for a period of time, it should be retested prior to entry and starting work. For example, when barges are left unattended at night, unidentified products from another barge are sometimes dumped into their empty tanks. Since this would result in a changed atmosphere, the tanks should be retested prior to entry and starting work.   5.     Work break.     When workers take a break or leave at the end of the shift, equipment sometimes is inadvertently left in the tanks. At lunch or work breaks and at the end of the shift are the times when it is most likely someone will leave a burning or cutting torch in the tank, perhaps turned on and leaking oxygen or an inert gas. Since the former can produce an oxygen-enriched atmosphere, and the latter an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, tanks should be checked for equipment left behind, and atmosphere, monitored if necessary prior to re-entering and resuming work. In an oxygen-enriched atmosphere, the flammable range is severely broadened. This means that an oxygen-enriched atmosphere can promote very rapid burning.   6.     Ballasting or trimming.     Changing the position of the ballast, or trimming or in any way moving the vessel so as to expose cargo that had been previously trapped, can produce a change in the atmosphere of the tank. The atmosphere should be retested after any such move and prior to entry or work.       Section 1915.14 (a) and (b)Hot work.     This is a reminder that other sections of the OSHA shipyard safety and health standards in part 1915 should be reviewed prior to starting any hot work. Most notably, Subpart D, Welding, Cutting and Heating, places additional restrictions on hot work: The requirements of 1915.51 and 1915.53 must be met before hot work is begun on any metal that is toxic or is covered by a preservative coating respectively; the requirements of 1915.54 must be met before welding, cutting, or heating is begun on any structural voids.       Section 1915.12(a)(2).     During hot work, more than 20.8 percent oxygen by volume can be unsafe since it extends the normal flammable range. The standard permits the oxygen level to reach 22 percent by volume in order to account for instrument error. However, the cause of excess oxygen should be investigated and the source removed.       Section 1915.16(b).     If the entire vessel has been found to be in the same condition, then employers shall be considered to be in compliance with this requirement when signs using appropriate warning language in accordance with 1915.16(a) are posted at the gangway and at all other means of access to the vessel.       Appendix B to Subpart B_Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Shipyard Employment       This Appendix provides a complete reprint of U.S. Coast Guard regulations as of October 1, 1993 referenced in Subpart B for purposes of determining who is a Coast Guard authorized person.   1. Title 46 CFR 35.011 (a) through (c) covering hot work on tank vessels reads as follows:   (a) The provisions of ``Standard for the Control of Gas Hazards on Vessels to be Repaired,'' NFPA No. 306, published by National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269, shall be used as a guide in conducting the inspections and issuance of certificates required by this section.

The figures from the CCFA, the French carmakers' committee, showed a particularly sharp fall in December. Car sales last month totalled 152,000, a fall of 31 per cent compared with the same period in 1992. Industry analysts in Paris said December's decline was exaggerated by artificially high sales at the end of 1992, the result of a rush by consumers to beat the expiry of tax incentives for low-pollution models. Excluding such factors, the decline in the month's sales was estimated at about 16 per cent. But the figures for December demonstrated the continued weakness of the car market. 'The impact of recession and depressed demand is very clear,' one industry analyst said. 'Cars, more than other consumer products, continue to suffer from a lack of economic confidence.' French manufacturers had, however, some cause for comfort. The combined sales of the French car companies represented 60.3 per cent of the market, an increase of 0.5 per cent compared with 1992. Renault, the state-owned group, limited its fall in sales to 15.1 per cent, partly reflecting the successful introduction of models such as the Twingo. Citroen saw sales fall by 16 per cent, and was also supported by the introduction of models like the Xantia mid-range car. Peugeot, however, its partner in the PSA Peugeot-Citroen group, suffered a fall of 22.6 per cent. Most industry executives expect some recovery in the market this year, although they emphasise the slow pace of revival and continued high level of competition. Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot- Citroen, forecast total car sales in France would rise to about 1.85m units in 1994. French car manufacturers also continue to suffer in the face of difficult international markets. According to figures from the CCFA, exports amounted to 1.68m in the first 11 months of 1993, a fall of 13.25 per cent.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

The purpose of the circular is to implement the relevant  instructions of the Guangzhou Military Region and the Guangdong  Provincial Military District. The circular demands that all  military institutions stationed in Shenzhen should check their  military vehicles before the end of April; those holding  certificates at or above the division level should obtain a  ""military vehicle registration form"" from the garrison and  submit the filled-out form for verification. After verification  that the military vehicle's license plate number conforms with  the driving license number, the garrison will issue a ""military  vehicle registration certificate."" On discovery, individuals  using military vehicles in Shenzhen without registration  certificates will be given severe punishments according to the  relevant regulations.    Unqualified localities, units, or individuals illegally  obtaining military vehicle certificates must stop using these  certificates immediately, return them to the original users, or  submit them to the garrison. Those who continue to use these  certificates will be held responsible and will receive severe  punishments according to the relevant regulations.    The circular points out that counterfeiting military vehicle  certificates, and selling or using false certificates are  illegal. Individuals involved in these activities must confess  their offenses to the Shenzhen Garrison before 30 April to  receive lenient treatment. Otherwise, public security  departments will hold them responsible for the criminal offenses  they have committed.    The circular stipulates: Military vehicles are not allowed  to be used for production purposes, and buses with military  license plate numbers are not allowed to be used for business  purposes. Vehicles for construction and transportation use must  observe the local government's relevant regulations, and are not  allowed to operate in excess of their capacity or to pollute the  city's environment. Military vehicles without rear mudguards,  dirty vehicles, or vehicles in bad technical condition will not  be issued ""military registration certificates""; these vehicles  are not allowed to operate.    The circular demands that military vehicle drivers strictly  observe traffic rules, foster good professional ethics and  driving habits, follow the instructions of traffic policemen,  and consciously safeguard the Army's reputation.

0,FT934-17178 ,"FT934-17178 _AN-DJCANAA2FT 931002   FT  02 OCT 93 / Japanese warn of further downturn      By ROBERT THOMSON      TOKYO   THE Japanese government warned yesterday that the economy might be entering a new phase of downturn, as a fall in job openings reflected the pressure on many companies to cut costs by dismissing workers. Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the international trade and industry minister, asked that companies attempt to solve their surplus labour problem 'internally,' meaning that they should transfer staff within the company rather than cut the workforce. His comments reflect widespread concern that dismissals could further undermine consumer confidence and cause deeper social damage by ending the promise of lifetime employment in Japan. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, also said he was very worried by signs that the job market was deteriorating, as highlighted by a fall in the job offers to applicants ratio from 72:100 in July to 70:100 in August. New job offers in manufacturing fell by 26 per cent year-on-year, while new offers in the service sector fell by 13.8 per cent, surprising government officials who hoped that this sector would absorb surplus labour. The Management and Co-ordination Agency said the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in August was 2.5 per cent, unchanged from a month earlier, though the government tends to regard the job offers ratio as a more accurate reflection of labour market trends. Most large companies have reduced their annual intake of graduates and plan to trim the workforce through natural attrition, but the government fears that the yen's rapid appreciation and weak domestic demand will force further job cuts. Japanese manufacturers, responding to the yen's rise, have recently rushed to invest in lower-cost east Asian sites, and Mr Kumagai warned that the investment flow could lead to a hollowing-out of the technology industry. The pressure on manufacturers was indicated by a 5 per cent year-on-year fall in new vehicle sales in September, the sixth consecutive month of decline. The Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said passenger car sales dipped 2.5 per cent, while truck sales slipped 9.9 per cent. Meanwhile, the Labour Ministry said overtime hours worked in the manufacturing sector contracted 10.9 per cent from a year earlier, continuing a fall that began in December 1990.

Most interest is focused on recent finds, especially four boxes discovered on July 12 in a Wiesbaden apartment previously occupied by two of Mr Lopez's colleagues. The duo quit GM's German subsidiary, Adam Opel, shortly after Mr Lopez was appointed production and procurement director at VW. The cartons are known to have contained details of a secret new car model, but it is understood that further confidential information was also discovered. Mr Lopez and his associates, backed by VW and the group's supervisory board, have consistently denied that they took or delivered any secrets to VW. The state prosecutors, who launched their probe after GM established grounds for suspicion of industrial spying by presenting affidavits from its employees, have already interviewed more than 30 employees of the US-based automotive group. VW staff have also been called in, but it is understood that Mr Lopez and his associates who joined him at VW when he quit General Motors, have yet to be interviewed. Mr Lopez and Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez, his closest aide at GM and now at VW, are believed to be on holiday. Personal testimony and affidavits from GM staff played a key role in a Hamburg court ruling earlier this week in which VW failed to prevent Der Spiegel news magazine from continuing to publish allegations of industrial espionage against VW and its employees. Opel said yesterday that if VW pressed on with a full court hearing to try to reimpose a gag on Der Spiegel, it expected its employees would be prepared to appear again to support the magazine's case. Volkswagen confirmed that it was considering restarting legal proceedings after this week's setback, but it wanted to see the court's reasoned opinion on the rulings first. According to VW, it could be several weeks before the written opinion is ready.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

""They  were so frequent, so we told the officers to interview these people. And we  finally got one who helped us make a contact.""    That is how officers learned about Paul Howard Schwartz, 18, a senior at  Irvine's University High School, who was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of  operating a $1,000-a-week business doctoring up to 250 licenses for customers,  Jones said.    Most were being altered for people ages 16 to 18 -- those most likely to use  fake IDs to gain entry into nightclubs or buy liquor, Jones said.    Police are continuing their investigation into the operation and plan to take  the case to the district attorney's office this week, Jones said.    The state Department of Motor Vehicles is also considering revoking or  suspending the licenses of all customers who had their licenses altered, he  said.    Schwartz was released on his own recognizance to his parents, Jones said  Thursday. Schwartz was not available for comment.    At Schwartz's home, Irvine officers confiscated more than 100 valid driver's  licenses in various stages of being altered, said Jones, who added that just 25  of the licenses had Irvine addresses.    Irvine police first contacted Schwartz at the end of April, when undercover  officers ordered doctored driver's licenses from him, turning over to him some  of their own licenses, including Jones'.    When Schwartz saw Jones' license, he asked one of the undercover officers why  someone who was obviously older than 21 wanted a doctored license.    ""Because he's a criminal, and he wants to hide his identity,"" the undercover  officers told Schwartz, according to Jones.    ""He really wasn't interested,"" Jones said of Schwartz. ""He was a little  paranoid and cautious at first. But apparently we gave him a suitable answer.""    To the untrained eye, the altered licenses would be unlikely to raise  suspicion, Jones said. ""They were very good counterfeits. A trained observer,  upon close examination, could see the difference. But if you were in a hurry  and someone just flashed you a wallet, it could have passed with no problem.""    He said Schwartz also apparently kept reproductions of some of the altered  licenses and was peddling them as well.    Officers found an extra copy of Jones' license at Schwartz's home when he was  arrested, Jones said.    University High Principal Bob Bruce declined to comment on Schwartz, calling  the incident a police matter, but he talked about why young people might want  fake driver's licenses.    ""If you're a young person in Orange County, what do you do?"" Bruce asked. ""We  don't have a lot of so-called wholesome activities. We have a few social  activities, but most of the businesses that cater to those kinds of kids, you  don't see much anymore, such as bowling alleys, skating rinks. . . . There's  not much for kids left to do.    ""If you're not quite 21, what do you do?

STAY OUT OF THE MEDIAN      By ERIC BAILEY      Dear Street Smart:    I was wondering why there are no call boxes in the median of the freeways. I  see an awful lot of people stuck there.    Rita Williams    Rancho Santa Margarita    Aside from certain spots in East Beirut, the median strip on a Southern  California freeway is the most dangerous spot to be with a broken-down car. On  most Orange County freeways, there's hardly room for a bicycle to park, let  alone an automobile.    With that in mind, the California Department of Transportation has avoided  putting call boxes along the median strip, where they would be magnets for  motorists in trouble, said Albert Miranda, a Caltrans spokesman.    Miranda said officials encourage motorists with flat tires, engine problems or  other malfunctions to pull off to the nearest freeway exit or over to the  shoulder, where they generally have a better chance of staying out of harm's  way.    That's not always possible, of course. If the freeway is jam-packed when your  Buick starts belching black smoke, you may have no choice but to stop in the  median.    The first thing to do is avoid heart failure. Tell life to go pass in front of  someone else's eyes, then take steps to save your own hide. Miranda recommends  taking a tip from Caltrans road crews: Get to the front of the car so you can  use the vehicle as a shield from oncoming traffic; keep your eyes fixed on the  cars barreling toward you.    Those tactics are also recommended for folks forced to stop on a freeway  shoulder. Most of our local freeways, unlike members of the Los Angeles Rams,  don't have broad shoulders. In fact, some aren't much wider than a median  strip. The pressure to handle heavy traffic flow has resulted in crowding more  lanes onto a freeway right-of-way that rarely gets bigger.    Dear Street Smart:    In the Feb. 5 edition, you had a letter from a woman who had a battered license  plate that she wanted to have replaced but who had been told by the Department  of Motor Vehicles that new plates for existing numbers are not issued. All she  could do, they said, was get a new license number.    But she has another option -- getting the plate restored. She could try  Darryl's Plates, 4505 8th Ave. South, No. A-10, St. Petersburg, Fla., 33711. He  does a masterful job of restoring a plate for less than $25, including return  shipping.    I just had one of those old black and gold California plates done by him, and  it came back better than new.    As for the state requirement that plates be on both front and rear bumpers: A  front license plate is ugly on a nice car. It's a waste of taxpayers' money  besides.    Police will stop you if you have no front plate. I know. (I think they actually  want to see one's car close up if it is at all antique, modified or otherwise  out of the ordinary.)    Jerry Bernheimer    Newport Beach    An interesting tip. There's a whole cottage industry of folks who specialize in  license plate repair and resale. Some people have made a business of salvaging  the old black California plates from junkyards, then restoring and reselling  them.    Using such restored plates is legal, according to Gina McGuiness, a spokeswoman  for the state Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento. The job must be done  properly, though. The plate cannot be cut down in size, and the original colors  must be used.    Dear Street Smart:    I'm a police officer with the UC Irvine police department. In your article  about minors in pickup truck beds (Feb. 19), you said that people under age 18  could not ride in a pickup bed.    I thought you might like to know that actually that's not quite correct. The  California Vehicle Code states that no one shall transport a minor under the  age of 12 in the back of a truck unless it is enclosed to a height of 46  inches. The code also says that if the children are secured so as to prevent  their being thrown, that makes it OK.    Scott Roberts    Irvine    Thanks for straightening that out. Street Smart's answers are only as good as  the information we get from officials with the California Highway Patrol, local  police departments, Caltrans and other agencies. In this case, a lieutenant at  the Highway Patrol's Santa Ana office supplied incorrect information about the  age limit for riders in pickup beds. Perhaps he'll start doing a better job of  reading his vehicle code handbook. And so will we.

Background           History of Department of Transportation Regulation of Etiologic Agents/Infectious Substances         A. Regulation Prior to 1991        The Hazardous Materials Regulations Board (Board; a predecessor to the RSPA) adopted a final rule under Docket HM142 on September 30, 1972 (37 FR 20554), that added ``etiologic agents'' to the list of hazardous materials regulated by the Secretary. The final rule at 49 CFR 173.386(a)(1) defined an etiologic agent as           a viable microorganism, or its toxin, which causes or may cause human disease, and is limited to those agents listed in 42 CFR 72.25(c) of the regulations of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.            (The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) is now the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)). The final rule at 49 CFR 173.387 also specified packaging requirements for etiologic agents, and excepted, at 49 CFR 173.386(d), from DOT regulation ``diagnostic specimens'' and ``biological products,'' which were subject to regulation by HEW. The final rule was adopted after notice and opportunity to comment (36 FR 25163, December 29, 1971).         On November 29, 1972, after receiving two petitions for reconsideration and several comments, the Board proposed in the     Federal Register     (37 FR 25243) to except from DOT regulation cultures of etiologic agents of less than 50 milliliters (1.666 fluid ounces) in one package. The petitions stated that such an exception was necessary to allow physicians in rural areas to transport cultures to laboratories on passenger-carrying aircraft, rather than by slower surface transportation which, in turn, promotes health safety. The petitions added that cultures of etiologic agents may perish if in transportation too long. The Board adopted the proposal as final on March 29, 1973 (38 FR 8161). One commenter objected to excepting such quantities of etiologic agents from all regulation. The Board noted, however, that quantities of etiologic agents excepted from DOT regulation would still be subject to HEW labeling and packaging regulations under 42 CFR 72.25(c). The March 29, 1973 rule also adopted incident notification requirements for etiologic agents, as proposed on July 22, 1972 (37 FR 14728).           B. The 1988 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) under Docket HM142A          On November 10, 1988, RSPA proposed (Docket HM142A, 53 FR 45525) to revise the definition of ``etiologic agent,'' remove the 50 milliliter (ml) exception, and align the per package quantity limits of etiologic agents aboard aircraft with the International Civil Aviation Organization Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air (ICAO Technical Instructions). RSPA proposed broadening the definition of ``etiologic agent'' to include, in addition to etiologic agents listed by DHHS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) in 42 CFR 72.3, any agent that poses a similar degree of hazard, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). RSPA noted that the proposed definition was not as broad as the definition for infectious substances (Division 6.2) contained in the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Recommendations) and international regulations based on the UN Recommendations, such as the ICAO Technical Instructions. CDC has not updated the list in 42 CFR 72.3 since July 1, 1980 (45 FR 48627). On March 2, 1990 (55 FR 7678), CDC proposed to delete the list from its regulations and adopt criteria to define ``etiologic agent,'' but a final rule has not been published.         C. January 3, 1991 final rule under Docket HM142A          On January 3, 1991, RSPA published a final rule in the     Federal Register     (56 FR 197) under Docket HM142A. The final rule (1) adopted a revised definition of ``etiologic agent,'' (2) removed the 50 ml exception, and (3) clarified quantity limitations for etiologic agents transported aboard aircraft. ``Etiologic agent'' was defined to mean           a viable microorganism, or its toxin, which is listed in 42 CFR 72.3 of the regulations of the [CDC] or which causes or may cause severe, disabling or fatal human disease.             The definition adopted differed from the proposed definition in response to commenters who suggested that the language of the definition be modified to better reflect agents that may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety during transportation. Accordingly, the wording was revised to include other agents that cause or may cause severe, disabling or fatal human diseases in humans in addition to the agents listed in 42 CFR 72.3 of the CDC regulations. In response to comments, RSPA indicated in the preamble that it believed most medical waste is composed of material that does not contain etiologic agents, either because it does not contain any infectious material or because the infectious material does not meet the regulatory definition of etiologic agent. RSPA also stated that, in many cases, if medical waste is known or suspected to contain an etiologic agent, it is treated on-site to destroy the agent by using a method such as incineration, autoclaving, or treatment with disinfectants. However, RSPA clearly stated that ``*** if an infectious waste that contains an etiologic agent is offered for transportation, it must conform with the requirements in the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR parts 171180) for etiologic agents'' (56 FR 198). As stated earlier, the final rule also removed the 50 ml exception, as proposed in 1988. The January 3 preamble responded to numerous comments received on the 50 ml proposal and comprehensively discussed the reasons for this action.

As stated earlier, the final rule also removed the 50 ml exception, as proposed in 1988. The January 3 preamble responded to numerous comments received on the 50 ml proposal and comprehensively discussed the reasons for this action.          "

Giving details of this Indian conspiracy to defame Pakistan, the  minister called upon the international community to use its  influence to check India from indulging in such shameful  activities.    There can be no difference of opinion on the question of  India's hostility toward Pakistan. It has not accepted Pakistan  from the very beginning, and that is why it never misses any  opportunity to malign Pakistan on any issue. In the past too, a  large quantity of chemical used in heroin processing was seized  from the Samjhauta Express train, but the parties involved in  this trade later tried to cover it up as a chemical openly sold  in the Akbari market. Now that it has been fully proved that  India is smuggling chemicals into Pakistani territory, including  its tribal areas, not only through the Samjhauta Express but  also through its agents, the government should take stringent  measures to check this smuggling. It should also take video of  such seizures and show it to the international community with  documentary proof thereof, so the world can see the black side  of the Indian character and realize to what extent India can go  to fulfill its unholy ambitions and abominable designs.

0,FT932-6611 ,"FT932-6611 _AN-DE0B8AF8FT 930527   FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Court rejects GM case against former staff      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   GENERAL Motors, the world's leading volume carmaker, yesterday suffered its first important loss in the legal battle against Germany's Volkswagen. An initial bid to prevent seven former employees of GM and Adam Opel, the US group's German subsidiary, from working for Volkswagen for 12 months was thrown out by a Frankfurt court. Meanwhile, a public prosecutor examining GM's complaints of industrial espionage against a top VW executive, said preliminary investigations could last at least six months. This followed a statement that enough information had already been gathered to justify an initial probe. The US concern had been asked to provide further documents to back its most serious claim against VW: that its former global buying chief, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and others had taken secret documents and industrial information with him when he defected to VW in March. Opel said later the case against the seven more junior VW employees would continue. Yesterday's rejection at an oral hearing of Opel's application for an urgent temporary injunction would be followed by a full hearing, he added. Timing would depend on the court's timetable. 'We had expected this verdict,' Dr Lopez said. 'We came to Volkswagen of our own free will. Every person has the right to choose where he works.' The decision was the first significant setback for Opel, which recently won an injunction barring VW from continuing 'systematically' to poach its personnel. According to Opel, Mr Lopez and his colleagues had approached around 40 senior buying and production staff. According to a VW official, the company had chosen not to challenge this injunction to 'avoid further legal conflict and because the charge was not valid either in the past or now'. The seven involved in yesterday's case, which did not involve Mr Lopez, include former top members of Mr Lopez's buying team at GM, who left the US shortly after their boss. Most notable is Mr Jose Gutierrez, GM's former machinery and equipment procurement chief, and now head of purchasing for the VW brand division. The delays caused by the long investigation into the charges against Mr Lopez, and the rejection of the call for the injunction, will bring widespread relief to VW. They will allow its new employees to press ahead with the urgent overhaul of the purchasing and manufacturing processes.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Volkswagen.     Adam Opel.

Effective Date             In developing the final rule, OSHA has considered whether a delayed effective date is necessary for any of the provisions of the standard. Employers will need time to integrate their procedures for complying with the provisions in this standard as applied to land-side confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. Although the record indicates that the new provisions (training, rescue, and duties to other employers) being used on board vessels and vessel sections are current industry practice, under this standard they also have been expanded to include land-side operations. OSHA believes that a period of 90 days will be adequate for this purpose, since most of the requirements in the final rule do not require extensive training or major modifications of existing work practices. This amount of time will be adequate for employers to ensure that their work practices conform to the requirements of the revised standard.       VI. Information Collection Requirements             5 CFR part 1320 sets forth procedures for agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The final Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres standard requires the employer to allow OSHA access to the competent person roster, testing and inspection results, and training records. In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, OSHA certifies that it has submitted the information collection to OMB for review under section 3504(b) of that Act.         Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average five minutes per response to allow OSHA compliance officers access to the employer's records. Send comments regarding this burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of Information Management, Department of Labor, room N1301, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres). Washington, DC 20503.       VII. Federalism             This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting state policy options, consult with states before taking any actions which would restrict state policy options, and take such actions only if there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for preemption of state law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible.         Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt state laws relating to issues on which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health standards. Under the OSH Act, a state can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as the Federal standards. Where such standards are applicable to products distributed or used in interstate commerce, they may not unduly burden commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions. (See section 18(c)(2) of the OSH Act.)         The Federal standards on confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres address hazards which are not unique to any one state or region of the country. Nonetheless, states with occupational safety and health plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own state standards to deal with any special problems which might be encountered in a particular state. Moreover, because these standards are written in general, performance-oriented terms, there is considerable flexibility for state plans to require, and for affected employers to use, methods of compliance which are appropriate to the working conditions covered by the standard.         In brief, this final rule addresses a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in shipyard employment. States which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSH Act are not preempted by this standard and will be able to address any special conditions within the framework of the Federal Act, while ensuring that the state standards are at least as effective as this standard.       VIII. State Plan Standards             The 23 states and 2 territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans must adopt a comparable standard within 6 months of the publication date of the final standard. These states and territories are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut,    4     Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York,    5     North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming. Until such time as a state standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these states.             4     Plan covers only State and local government employees.              5     Plan covers only State and local government employees.

KINNEY and HOWARD FRUMKIN, Joseph A. Kinney is executive director  of the National Safe Workplace Institute in Chicago. Howard Frumkin, a director  of the institute, is on the faculty of the Medical School of the University of  Pennsylvania.      Dangerous work is a major contributing factor to poverty in America. Most  people assume that workers' compensation, insurance and lawsuits take care of  families when injuries, fatalities or disease strike. The reality is much  different.    Families often experience a sharp reduction in income when injury from  dangerous work strikes, prematurely ending careers. For example, workers'  compensation supplies at best two-thirds of a worker's historic (average of the  last two years) earnings, and usually provides far less. Meanwhile, benefits  such as health insurance may be lost, imposing drastic new expenses on the  family.    America needs to understand the scope of this problem and how it came about.  Before 1911, a work-related injury or disease was considered the fault of the  worker. In the following decade, most state governments passed workers'  compensation programs, a no-fault insurance scheme that covered medical  expenses and lost wages when workers were injured.    These programs had a significant unintended consequence: They tended to  legitimate worker injury by ""taking care of it"" with modest compensation  payments. In other words, some injury was accepted because compensation,  however meager, was available. Employers' insurance costs could be comfortably  predicted and made a part of each year's budget. Business as usual prevailed.    Workers' compensation programs were adopted in an era when workplace accidents  were widely recognized, but occupational diseases were nearly invisible. Since  then, through tragedy after tragedy, we have been reminded that black lung,  asbestosis, silicosis, lead poisoning, cancer and other diseases may begin with  workplace exposures. But there are many barriers to workers' compensation for  diseases, and it is estimated that less than 10% of serious disease cases are  currently compensated. Many deserving workers simply go without.    Even for those who receive workers' compensation, the payments are likely to be  inadequate. In fact, families experiencing the temporary or permanent loss of a  breadwinner in the 1980s are probably worse off than those who experienced a  comparable loss in the 1970s. Workers' compensation payments are tied to the  victim's wages, and real wages of middle- income Americans have declined during  the last decade. Sixty percent of a machinist's wage today buys less than 60%  of a machinist's wage 15 years ago. Further, unrealistic caps on compensation  -- typically ranging between $200-$250 a week -- often impose limits that  assure absolute poverty for many families.    Moreover, the availability of lawsuits as a remedy has greatly diminished in  recent years. Responding to the alleged liability crisis, state legislatures  have imposed low wrongful death caps and greater restrictions such as  comparative negligence requirements. In many states, lawsuits arising from  dangerous workplace incidents have dropped from a trickle to a halt.    The magnitude of this problem is not small. Studies at the Mount Sinai School  of Medicine in New York show that as many as 70,000 men and women die of  occupational disease each year. According to the National Safety Council,  11,000 men and women die from traumatic workplace accidents each year. Another  70,000 workers are permanently disabled. We believe that 50,000 more  individuals will be disabled and off the payrolls for at least six months this  year.    Based on demographic patterns, we can estimate that at least half of the total  -- or at least 100,000 -- disabled men and women will have dependents, and that  the majority of them will suffer a substantial decline in income after losing a  breadwinner.    This problem has not come cheap to the public. Congress has partly addressed  the problem by tapping Social Security -- robbing Peter to pay Paul. Working  with government analysts, we estimate that workplace accidents and diseases  cost the Social Security Trust Fund $7.65 billion in fiscal 1988. This Band-Aid  strategy, while helpful to some workers, simply transfers the costs of  dangerous workplaces from employers to taxpayers.    It is terribly wrong for a family that suffers one tragedy to suffer another.  Two solutions are needed. First, we need better ways to compensate workers who  become injured or ill while on the job. Workers' compensation must be expanded  to cover illnesses, must provide adequate wage replacement and must be  streamlined to achieve prompt payments. Other strategies, such as insurance  mechanisms, litigation and service programs, must be considered.    A second key element is the prevention of workplace injuries and accidents. As  we come to understand the nature and costs of the problem, we must apply this  understanding to research, risk assessment and enforcement of strong health and  safety standards. By addressing the problem on the front end, we can reduce the  contribution of dangerous workplaces to suffering and poverty in America.

Vietnam Motors is a joint venture between Columbian Motors of the Philippines, which holds a 55 per cent stake, Nichimen of Japan with a 15 per cent stake and a Vietnamese state company. The group plans to produce the Renault 19 small family car with assembly of Renault's CKD (completely knocked down) kits likely to begin in early 1995. It already assembles the Mazda 626 and 323 from kits along with some products from Kia, the South Korean carmaker. It also plans to start assembly of the BMW 525 at its plant near Hanoi in September. As an emerging market Vietnam is being viewed with great interest by several of the world's leading vehicle makers. Last month Mitsubishi Motors became the first Japanese carmaker to enter a joint venture in Vietnam. It has received approval by the Vietnamese government to form a joint vehicle manufacturing and sales venture in Vietnam along with Proton, the Malaysian carmaker in which it holds a minority stake and Vietranscimex, a Vietnamese national company. They are forming a joint venture, Vina Star Motors, in which Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi Corporation and Proton will each hold stakes of 25 per cent, to assemble the Mitsubishi Delica minibus. Production is scheduled to start next March. Mekong, a Japanese-South Korean joint venture with Vietnamese companies, assembles four-wheel-drive vehicles at a plant in Ho Chi Minh City and has a plant near Hanoi that produces light buses and trucks in co-operation with Iveco, the commercial vehicle subsidiary of Fiat of Italy. Reuter, the news agency, reported yesterday that a senior official of Vietnam Motors in Hanoi had confirmed that the Vietnamese government had decided to raise taxes on imported cars to 200 per cent from the present level of 150 per cent from July 1. Most imported cars come from Japan. 'We hope it will be very good news for us because imported cars will be very expensive,' said Mr Joaquin Roa, VMC general manager. The impact of the higher tax would depend, however, on effective policing of the borders to prevent smuggling, which increased when governments raised car import taxes.   Companies:-  Renault.

The Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Shipyard Employment Standard Complies With the Statutory Criteria Described Above and Is Not Subject to the Additional Constraints Applicable to Section 6(b)(5) Standards        Standards which regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards. (See     National Grain  Feed Ass'n v.

In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Shipyard Employment standard is a safety standard, because the standard addresses hazards, such as asphyxiation, explosions, and fires, that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards subject to section 6(b)(5).   The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part:           ***by exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational safety.           The legislative history makes this distinction even clearer:           [The Secretary] should take into account that anyone working in toxic agents and physical agents which might be harmful may be subjected to such conditions for the rest of his working life, so that we can get at something which might not be toxic now, if he works in it a short time, but if he works in it the rest of his life might be very dangerous; and we want to make sure that such things are taken into consideration in establishing standards.

Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example, the Court in     International Union, UAW v. OSHA,     938 F.2d 1310 (D.C.

0,FT944-18073 ,"FT944-18073 _AN-EJED5AEHFT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / Ford puts two UK plants on short-time working      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Workers at Ford's Halewood and Dagenham car plants are to go on short-time for the rest of this month, taking a total of 8,000 Escorts and 2,000 Fiestas out of production. Ford put most of the blame on a weaker than expected UK market. But its main rivals said they had no plans to take similar action and dismissed speculation that the move might indicate a faltering of the UK economic recovery. Ford is to review its decision towards the end of the month, when it is expected to extend short-time working into November, and possibly to the end of the year. Retail motor trade leaders believe that Ford, UK market leader, has been particularly hard hit by the industry's overoptimistic forecast of the likely size of the annual August sales 'bulge'. Most of the UK car trade had expected the August market to reach 500,000 units, a figure matching the record of 1989, but it reached only 452,000. Motor traders claim that many of these 'sales' were pre-registered by manufacturers or their dealers and, as a result, have yet to find final buyers. Mr Alan Pulham, head of the National Franchised Dealers' Association, said last night that the miscalculation meant there were nearly 100,000 excess new cars in the industry's supply pipeline. The excess stocks would sharply increase competition in the final quarter of the year. However, he described the excess as a 'blip we have to go through; I don't think we have an underlying economic weakness'. Ford's Halewood plant on Merseyside will bear the brunt of the cuts in hours. Its 5,000 employees are to work for three days a week until the end of the month, losing output of 800 cars each day. Although the Escort is the UK's best-selling car, Halewood supplies the UK market solely. A small proportion of its Escort van production is exported. The Dagenham plant, which makes Fiesta cars and vans, will lose a total of two days' production this month, amounting to a total of 2,000 cars and vans. It has not been so badly hit because it exports about a third of its output to continental Europe. Vauxhall, second in the UK market, said yesterday it had no plans to cut production. Peugeot Talbot is raising production at its Ryton plant near Coventry. See Lex Ford's smallest car, Page 30 GM shake-up, Page 30   Companies:-  Ford Motor.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

This is particularly the case with respect to the only two measures to which substantial emissions reductions are assigned: FC3_Employer-Based Trip Reduction (advances beyond existing Regulation XV), and FC4_Additional VMT/VT Reduction Strategies. EPA hopes to receive these revised measures as a SIP submittal and will take action to approve or conditionally approve the controls at that time.     The CO plan therefore lacks approvable measures that fulfill the section 187(a)(3) requirements for fully adopted contingency measures to be triggered if estimates of actual VMT exceed the plan's forecasted levels. EPA proposes to disapprove the plan with respect to this requirement. In separate rulemaking, EPA will propose as part of the South Coast ozone and CO FIP/SIP a substitute contingency measure to be implemented automatically in the event actual VMT excesses are monitored.     i.     Transportation control measures (TCMs) to offset growth in emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled.     Section 187(b)(2) of the Act requires ``Serious'' CO areas to meet a TCM requirement specified in section 182(d)(1)(A) for ``Severe'' and ``Extreme'' ozone areas. The Act provides that all such plans must include specific and enforceable TCMs to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT and numbers of vehicle trips, and to achieve reductions in mobile source emissions as necessary in conjunction with other measures to comply with the periodic emissions reduction and attainment requirements of the Act. EPA's preliminary interpretation of this requirement appears in the General Preamble, 57 FR 1352113523 and 1353313534 (April 16, 1992).     As mentioned above, Table 66 of the South Coast CO plan includes 11 transportation and indirect source ``contingency'' measures. These measures and the plan's scheduled adoption dates are as follows:               FC1, Transit Improvements (to be determined by the implementing agency)     FC2, HOV and Bus Lanes/Roads (to be determined by the implementing agency)     FC3, Employer-Based Trip Reduction (1993)     FC4, Additional VMT/VT Reduction Strategies (19892000, with an SCAQMD backstop rule adoption in 1994, if necessary)     FC5, Traffic Flow Improvements (19892000)     FC6, Control Extended Idling (1993)     FC7, Encourage Removal of Pre-1980 Vehicles (1993)     FC8, Reduce Cold Start Emissions from Vehicles (1994)     MH1, Environmental Review Program (1992)     MH2, Trip Reduction for Schools (1993)     MH4, Special Activity Centers (1993)                 While progress has been made in local and regional adoption and implementation of certain measures (e.g., FC1, FC2, FC4, and FC5), none of these important measures has been fully adopted and submitted at this time.         Table 33 of the CO plan projects VMT and CO emissions for each year through the attainment year. This table shows that CO emissions will decline each year through the year 2000, despite the predicted VMT growth. As a result, the CO plan does not need to include TCMs to offset growth in CO emissions.     As discussed above, the CO plan would meet the attainment demonstration and progress requirements of the Act if the State adopts and submits an approvable enhanced I/M program. Until the attainment and RFP deficiencies are cured, it is not possible for EPA to find that the CO plan includes specific and enforceable TCMs that are sufficient, in conjunction with other measures, to meet the progress and attainment requirements of the Act. EPA therefore proposes to disapprove the plan with respect to the TCM requirement. Approval of an enhanced I/M program in the future would allow EPA to change this section 187(b)(2) disapproval to an approval.     j.     Fully adopted and enforceable control measures.     The attainment demonstration relies upon SCAQMD and CARB stationary, area, and mobile controls adopted before July 1, 1990, and three additional controls: (1) CARB's Low-Emission Vehicles (LEV) and Clean Fuels Program (adopted September 1990); (2) CARB's California Wintertime Oxygenates Program and Phase 2 Gasoline Specifications (adopted November 1991); and (3) an Enhanced I/M Program. Except for the enhanced I/M program, all of the measures included in the attainment modeling analysis are fully adopted and enforceable.     The plan also includes a group of 18 supplemental measures (Tables 41 and 42). Most of these measures have not yet been adopted in enforceable form, and the attainment demonstration does not claim credit for the potential reductions associated with the controls. If the measures are submitted by the State in approvable form, EPA will propose to approve them and assign them credit in the attainment demonstration.     k.     Implications of EPA's proposed action.     EPA is proposing to disapprove in part the SIP revision submitted by the State of California on December 31, 1992, for the South Coast CO nonattainment area. If finalized, this disapproval would constitute a disapproval under section 179(a)(2) of the Act (see generally 57 FR 1356613567). As provided under section 179(a) of the Act, the State would have up to 18 months after a final SIP disapproval to correct the deficiencies that are the subject of the disapproval before EPA is required to impose either the highway funding sanction or the requirement to provide two-to-one new source review offsets. If the State has not corrected its deficiency within 6 months thereafter, EPA must impose the second sanction. Any sanction EPA imposes must remain in place until EPA determines that the State has corrected the deficiency.         2. Ozone Rate of Progress Plan         a.     Statutory provisions and General Preamble requirements.     The requirements for the 15 percent rate-of-progress plans appear in section 182(b)(1) of the Act, which describes how ozone nonattainment areas must achieve an actual VOC reduction of at least 15 percent during the first 6 years after enactment of the 1990 CAA Amendments (i.e., up to November 15, 1996). The General Preamble provides an overview of EPA's preliminary policy interpretation of this statutory requirement (see 57 FR 1350713510, April 16, 1992). EPA has issued detailed guidance documents on the plan requirements, including: Guidance on the Adjusted Base Year Emissions Inventory and the 1996 Target for the 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans (EPA452/R92005), and Guidance for Growth Factors, Projections, and Control Strategies for the 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans (EPA452/R93002).     The CAA requires that the 15 percent rate-of-progress plan be submitted by November 15, 1993. The plan must show an actual reduction in typical ozone season weekday VOC emissions of at least 15 percent for the period 19901996. 20  The reduction must be calculated from the 1990 baseline of actual emissions, adjusted in accordance with section 182(b)(1)(B), and must account for any net growth in emissions. Section 182(b)(1)(D) provides that reductions from the federal motor vehicle control program (FMVCP) as promulgated by January 1, 1990, or from the federal 9.0 Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) gasoline regulation may not count toward meeting the 15 percent reduction target. Also excluded from credit are ``fix-ups'' to VOC RACT rules or I/M programs to comply with prior statutory and regulatory requirements.           20     For the initial progress period (19901996), the Act specifies that the SIP must ``provide for volatile organic compound emission reductions ... of at least 15 percent....'' Section 182(b)(1)(A). NO    x     emission reductions may substitute for VOC reductions in subsequent progress demonstrations, in accordance with section 182(c)(2)(C) of the Act.             "

0," FR941104-0-00024   FR941104-0-00009        One commenter was concerned about the interaction between regulation of radioactive materials under the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) and of hazardous wastes under RCRA, specifically that EPA's authorization of the State of Washington for RCRA corrective action under the State's Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA) would allow the Washington Department of Ecology to ``preempt'' the State Department of Health's regulatory authority (delegated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) over the operation of their facility. The commenter was also concerned about certain conflicting state regulatory and statutory provisions regarding the regulatory authority of the Department of Health.     In response, the State of Washington has not asked that the statutory provision cited by the commenter [RCW 70.105.240(2)] be authorized as part of the federally authorized RCRA program. As such, RCW 70.105.240(2) will not be part of the federally-authorized state RCRA corrective action program which will operate in lieu of the federal RCRA corrective action program. This will remain a ``state-only'' provision and EPA will not enforce it.     The State of Washington is today being authorized to implement its corrective action program in lieu of the federal RCRA corrective action program. The RCRA corrective action program seeks to address releases of hazardous waste and constituents from solid waste management units at a facility. ``Regulated units'' are units such as landfills, waste piles, surface impoundments, and land treatment units used to treat, store, or dispose of RCRA-regulated hazardous wastes and are subject to full regulation under subtitle C of RCRA.     See     40 CFR 264.90. ``Solid waste management units,'' or ``SWMUs,'' are any discernable units at which ``solid wastes'' may have been placed at any time.     See     55 FR 30798, 30874, July 27, 1990 (proposed RCRA Subpart S Rule). If EPA determines that the presence of solid or hazardous waste at either a regulated unit or a solid waste management unit has led to a release or a threatened release of a hazardous waste or constituent from such units, EPA can require the owner or operator of a unit to address such releases by taking necessary ``corrective action'' at the unit.     EPA's ability to require corrective action at such units does     not     mean that SWMUs are ``regulated'' under the RCRA ``base program'' and therefore subjected to RCRA permitting requirements. The RCRA ``base program'' consists, in part, of those provisions of RCRA that govern the generation, transport, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. The RCRA ``base program'' is considered to be those provisions of the RCRA program before the passage of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (``HSWA'') of 1984 to RCRA. HSWA introduced the corrective action requirements into the RCRA statute. In contrast and in general, only ``regulated units'' and generator accumulation areas are subject to the operational requirements of the RCRA ``base program.'' These operational requirements are separate and apart from any corrective action requirements that might be imposed by the State of Washington under the authorized state corrective action program.     Therefore, the commenter's concern that EPA's authorization of the State of Washington for RCRA     corrective action     will allow the Department of Ecology to ``preempt'' the Department of Health's regulatory authority over the     operation     of the commenter's facility is unfounded. If the State of Washington wanted to regulate the daily operations of the facility's radioactive waste management activities under RCRA, it would have to do so under the state's dangerous waste ``base'' RCRA program.     One commenter stated that ``Given that EPA has stated that it will interpret Washington's regulatory definition of SWMU against its discussion in the proposed corrective action rule, [the commenter] requests that the State of Washington through its authorized program will not be allowed to assert jurisdiction over mixed waste activities prior to July 3, 1986, as well.'' The commenter cites the State of Washington's recent definition of ``solid waste management unit'' which was added to the State's Dangerous Waste regulations, which ``means any discernable location at a facility, as defined for the purposes of corrective action, where solid wastes     have been placed at any time    ...'' (emphasis added). The commenter further states that ``the preamble to EPA's corrective action rule did not attempt to retroactively apply EPA's jurisdiction over mixed waste prior to July 3, 1986.''     In response, EPA has consistently interpreted the radioactive mixed waste to be a solid waste under RCRA for the purposes of RCRA corrective action (    see     55 FR 30798 at 30860, July 27, 1990 and 51 FR 24504 Footnote     #    1, July 3, 1986). Therefore, it is clear that EPA considers radioactive mixed waste to be a solid waste under RCRA for purposes of RCRA corrective action. Corrective actions under RCRA which address releases from solid waste management units are not limited to releases of hazardous waste or constituents after any certain date. EPA's proposed definition of a ``solid waste management unit'' in EPA's proposed Subpart S rule (    see     55 FR at 30808-30809) and the State of Washington's promulgated definition of a ``solid waste management unit'' in its Dangerous Waste Regulations (    see     WAC 173-303-646(2)(a)) both define a SWMU to include in part (state regulatory language differences are in brackets):             Any discernable unit [location at a facility] ... at which solid wastes have been placed at any time, irrespective of whether the unit was intended for the management of solid or hazardous [dangerous] waste.             Thus, EPA's determination that the hazardous component of radioactive mixed waste was     regulated     and subject to permitting requirements of Subtitle C of RCRA in 1986 does not affect EPA's ability (or a state's ability, when that state has been authorized for corrective action under RCRA) to require     corrective action     for the hazardous component of radioactive solid waste at SWMUs where such waste was disposed of before 1986.

Over the past years on the European territory of the country  winters have been warm, with frequent invasions of Atlantic  cyclones. The result of this process was protracted thaws.    The meteorological dictionary gives the following  definition:  A thaw is the warming of air temperature to the freezing mark  and above in winter time amidst temperatures that have settled  below freezing, most often as a result of the spread of warm air.    On the European territory of the country thaws result from a  stream of either moderate latitude sea air from the Atlantic  Ocean or the moderate latitude air returning from southern  regions through the Balkans and Asia Minor. Thaws are frequently  preceded by snowstorms. They are accompanied by cloudy, foggy  weather.    What is the danger of thaw periods? First and foremost, the  snow begins to melt, which increases the probability that  wintering plants will be subjected to the impact of the cold  when cold temperatures return. If the snow cover is low, and the  impact of warm air is long enough, the snow may to a  considerable extent or even completely melt.    The southern and western regions of the European territory  of  the country are subjected to the most frequent thaws. In the  current year December and January had plenty of protracted  thaws, which were only briefly interrupted by minor cold spells.  The most frequent thaws occur in March, when the atmosphere  shifts to summer mode.     "

0,FT933-11925 ,"FT933-11925 _AN-DG0CFAEPFT 930727   FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: VW and Suzuki abandon plan to develop small car      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN and Suzuki have abandoned a planned joint venture to develop and manufacture a mini-car for the European market. The German company said both sides had agreed the project was no longer feasible because of recession. The Japanese group said it had accepted a VW proposal to stop now, but added that it would continue to develop a car on the basis of results achieved so far. The two companies had settled on the final design and were discussing cost-sharing when the axe fell, Suzuki said. The plan called for up to 150,000 vehicles a year to be built at the Barcelona factory of Seat, VW's Spanish sub-sidiary. The cancellation is a further indication of VW's rigorous efforts to reduce costs and return to profit. It follows the company's withdrawal last year from a similar deal with SMH, the Swiss watchmaker, to develop a high-fashion 'Swatch car'. Both projects were part of a strategy, developed under the leadership of Mr Carl Hahn, the VW chairman who handed over to Mr Ferdinand Piech last January, to give Volkswagen a leading position in the small car market. At present, VW's smallest vehicle is the Seat Marbella. Growth in demand for even smaller cars is expected to outstrip that for most other classes in the latter half of this decade and beyond. Meanwhile, VW continues to develop its own Chico model to meet demand for cheap models better suited to crowded urban traffic conditions in western Europe and the spending power of people in the former communist bloc. At the same time, the German carmaker is continuing development of a super-lean, low-cost manufacturing process introduced by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, appointed production director after he joined the group in March from General Motors. Suzuki, in which GM has a small equity stake, had hoped to reap cost-sharing benefits from the deal and to gain a fresh manufacturing foothold in continental Europe. Although most of the Barcelona factory's output was planned to be sold under the Seat marque, some cars were to be marketed under the Suzuki name, unaffected by quota restrictions on 'Japanese' vehicles. Suzuki makes around 35,000 four-wheel drive vehicles a year at its Santana works in Spain and started manufacturing small cars in Hungary last year. Output at the Hungarian works, estimated at 15,000 units in the year to the end of October, is planned to increase to 50,000 in the medium-term.

A Karlsruhe Office press release on Thursday [14  April] says that the vehicles, found on 2 February and 14 March,  are registered to Klaus Steinmetz, liaison man of the Federal  Office for the Protection of the Constitution, whose information  led to the bloody antiterrorist operation in Bad Kleinen.    Already, on 24 March, the chief federal prosecutor initiated  investigations of unknown perpetrators on suspicion of RAF  membership and causing a bomb explosion. A passenger car and a  motorcycle were discovered. The chief federal prosecutor's  office did not reveal where the vehicles were found.

Of the 33 vehicles, five  trucks belong to Haitian merchants, and the remainder, made up  of trucks, jeeps, and cars, belongs to Dominican citizens. All  vehicles seized were taken to Armed Forces headquarters in Santo  Domingo for investigation.    Regarding the boat, reports indicate that it was a barge  carrying 800,000 gallons of diesel fuel and heading toward ""Fort  Liberte"" in Haiti. According to the Armed Forces Ministry,  sailors said it was heading north of Monte Cristi and that  later, it turned toward the south, entering Haitian territorial  waters.    Personnel on a Navy craft fired several shots, forcing the  barge and its seven Dominican crewmen to head toward a Dominican  port, where the men were arrested and the barge seized.

As a result the first Financial Times/Price Waterhouse survey should provide a valuable tool for corporate executives and others wishing to benchmark their companies against the best in Europe. This is a summary of the some of the results by sector: Automobiles/Auto Trucks  Parts Bayerische Motoren Werke, the German carmaker came top in this sector which had a particularly high response rate. BMW was followed by Robert Bosch, the German components manufacturer, and then Peugeot Citroen, the French motor group. Banks Although Deutsche Bank no longer ranks as Europe's biggest bank - that title is now held by HSBC following its takeover of Midland Bank - the German bank emerged well ahead of its rivals in a large sector. HSBC ranked fifth equal with Germany's BHF-Bank, behind UBS, Lloyds Bank and Spain's Banco de Santander. Beverages  Tobacco In this sector the only two non-British contenders, LVMH Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, the French luxury goods group, and Heineken, the Dutch brewer which has a substantial international reach, topped the rankings. However, Guinness and Whitbread were well placed and Grand Met scored well. Chemical, Paper  Packaging Ciba-Geigy, of Switzerland, which also has substantial pharmaceuticals interests, took first place in this sector even though L'Air Liquide, the world's biggest industrial gases group, made it into the top 25 list. Ciba did well mostly because of its customer focus, products and financial performance. However, unlike many other sectors, votes were very evenly spread across the industry. L'Air Liquide came second, followed closely by ICI, of the UK, Akzo, of the Netherlands, and Rhone Poulenc, the French chemicals group. Construction, Homebuilding  Building materials German and British companies shared the top honours in this sector. Philipp Holzmann emerged with most votes by a clear majority, followed by Britain's RMC Group, the world's biggest concrete producer, and Pilkington, the UK glassmaker. Dykerhoff, the German cement group which recently acquired a 50.05 per cent stake in Ciments Luxembourgeois, and Wolseley, the UK-based heating and plumbing merchant, also made it into the sector top five. Diversified Holding Companies This was one of the most difficult categories to rank because of the wide range of business activities covered. Nevertheless BTR, the British industrial conglomerate, emerged as clear winner, closely followed by UK-based Rentokil and Hanson. Chargeurs, the French textiles, transport and communications group, and Pinault, which owns the Printemps stores also made the top five. Electricity  Water Germany's largest utility group, RWE, led the electricity and water field, closely followed by Britain's Powergen and then Belgium's Electrabel, National Grid and Sweden's Vattenfall utility. Electronics  Electrical Components Siemens came top by a wide margin, followed by Alcatel-Alsthom, of France, Finland's Nokia, Sweden's Electrolux, Britain's GEC and then Philips of the Netherlands. Engineering Although ABB Asea Brown Boveri dominated this sector, Britain's Rolls-Royce and Linde, the German lift truck maker also rated highly. The top three were followed by Sandvik of Sweden and Williams Holdings of the UK. Food Processors Unilever and Switzerland's Nestle group headed this sector. They ranked fifth and sixth in the overall winners group. They were followed by BSN, the French-based multinational food group, Barilla, Italy's family owned pasta and biscuit group, was ranked number four in the sector. Insurance Germany's Munchener Ruckversicherungs group won the most praise in this category followed by Fortis, the Dutch/Belgium group, Swiss Reinsurance, Zurich Insurance and Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance company. Media, Printing  Advertising Reuters Holdings, the new and financial information group, stood head-and-shoulders above its rivals in this category receiving as many commendations as the next five companies put together. Reed-Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, came second, followed by the German Bertelsmann media group, Britain's EMAP and Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publishing group. Pharmaceuticals  Healthcare Switzerland's Roche claimed the top slot in this sector. Surprisingly however, Roche did not figure in the 25 overall winners. Glaxo, made it into the top 25. But in the sector it ranked third behind its arch ulcer drug competitor Sweden's Astra. SmithKline Beecham ranked fourth. Retail British companies, J Sainsbury and John Lewis took second and third places respectively after Marks  Spencer. Migros, Switzerland's leading food retailer, came fourth followed by the French-owned Carrefour group. Telecoms  Communications British Telecom emerged as the top-rated company, followed by PTT Nederland, the partially privatised Dutch telecommunications and postal company, and Vodafone, the UK cellular network operator. France Telecom, ranked number four followed by Cable  Wireless which owns the Mercury network in the UK.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   REASONS FOR SELECTING COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most  Least Important Qualities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            CUSTOMER FOCUS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   Enjoys high customer loyalty Least Important  Makes good use of technology in its customer services  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 PEOPLE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   People have the means and facilities to deliver results Least Important  Has demonstrated 'real' equal opportunities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important  Products solve problems and provide benefits Least Important       Invests heavily in RD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          BUSINESS PERFORMANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   Has shown consistent growthand long-term profitability Least Important  Is a low-cost producer  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   Displays positive managementstyle and attractive                  behaviour Least Important  Takes a strong position on social issues  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               STRATEGY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   Clear policy and objectives Least Important  Focusing on revenue growth rather than cost reduction  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             ENVIRONMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   Invests in pollution reduction measures Least Important  Policy shows in products and packaging  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Financial Times/Price Waterhouse  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Bayerische Motoren Werke.

He pulled from his stockpile  of videocassettes a four-year-old episode he directed for Steven Spielberg's  ""Amazing Stories"" TV series and inserted it into a tape machine.    In moments, a 6-foot image of Weird Al Yankovich dressed as a green alien  cabbage man materialized on screen. In a way, Weird Al was one of the more  normal sights in Hooper's home.    The horror director-whose latest work can be seen Wednesday at 9 p.m. on USA in  a new film called ""I'm Dangerous Tonight,"" starring Anthony Perkins and Madchen  Amick-keeps strange mementos from his pet projects.    Enshrined in a glass case is the meat hook from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""  (he says Spielberg has the other one). The dismembered hitchhiker corpse from  the same movie sits in his living room. Then there's the steel mallet from ""The  Texas Chainsaw Massacre II,"" a staircase banister from ""Salem's Lot"" and a  ceramic doll used in ""Freddy's Nightmares.""    The props, most grotesque and out of place in the quiet suburban house, are  tokens of an unassuming man whose paramour has always been film fantasy. His  supernatural USA movie stars Perkins as an archeology professor who helps one  of his students, Amick (Shelley of ""Twin Peaks""), when she succumbs to the  deadly powers of an ancient Aztec cloak.    ""I went to the movies every day, sometimes twice a day, growing up,"" said  Hooper, 47, who was raised in Austin and Dallas. Wearing a cap, T-shirt, jeans  and shoes-all solid black-Hooper sat in his living room holding a stubby,  unlighted cigar.    ""I saw everything,"" he continued. ""I always figured I would be there one day  making movies, because there really wasn't anything else I could do. That's all  I thought about. That's all I dreamed about. I would talk my teachers at school  into letting me turn in an 8mm film instead of written projects.""    When he was 25, the former University of Texas film student abandoned  documentaries and TV commercials to make a feature film called ""Eggshells."" ""We  shot for about nine months,"" Hooper said, his soft-spoken words a contrast to  his gravel-rock voice. ""It was partly shot off a script written on a napkin and  partly improvisational shooting.""    He paused and tried to light his cigar. It wouldn't light. He gave up and just  held the cigar in his hand.    ""It was a film about hippies at the end of the Vietnam War,"" he continued, Rand  they were living in a commune house that was also inhabited by this thing we  called a crypto-embryonic-hyper-electric presence.""    Hooper said that the low-low-budget ""Eggshells"" played in only about 50  theaters, but the horror element was a hit. ""I learned what I had to do to get  attention,"" he explained. ""I was in Texas, 2,000 miles away from the center of  activity in Los Angeles. I had to have a gimmick to get into any kind of  stream, let alone the mainstream.""    So Hooper co-wrote a script with Kim Henkel inspired by bloody events in  Wisconsin, raised $155,000 from a consortium of good-ol'-boy businessmen and  politicians in Austin and shot ""Chainsaw Massacre"" on 16mm film in the summer  of 1973.    The exploitation film, about a cannibalistic family who give new meaning to  roadside kill, first went largely unnoticed, then became a cult classic, then  spawned a hailstorm of imitations and now is hailed by some as a groundbreaking  classic.    After a couple of slick B-horror films and the acclaimed TV miniseries ""Salem's  Lot,"" based on Stephen King's novel, Hooper's career peaked in 1982 when he  directed the box-office hit ""Poltergeist"" for Spielberg, its co-writer and  producer. But at a time when his career should have skyrocketed, the media  climbed on Hooper's back and held him down with stories about Spielberg's  creative influence overpowering the contributions of his meek director.    It was almost a year before Hooper received another offer to direct. His next  film, ""Lifeforce"" in 1985, was a biggish-budget movie for Cannon Films, about  space vampires, that flopped in theaters. He directed another science-fiction  movie, a remake of the 1953 3-D classic ""Invaders From Mars,"" before turning  again to horror with a messy sequel to ""Chainsaw Massacre"" in 1986.    Now, Hooper is developing two new feature films and a TV series, and hopes to  shed the scaly reputation of a horror director.    ""I've been trying for many years to break out of that mold,"" Hooper said. ""The  face of horror is changing. I think we're about saturated with graphics. I  definitely think it's taking a turn toward the psychological and emotional.""    Hooper proudly went on to tell of an ""Equalizer"" episode he directed about the  homeless. As he spoke he tried to light his cigar again. This time it stayed  lit, and the red ember glowed brightly.    ""Oh no, no. I don't think so,"" Hooper responded when asked if he planned to  retire one day soon. He shook his head and smiled as if he just heard an inside  joke. ""There's nothing else I want to do. This is all I've ever wanted to do.  It's like play for me. Orson Welles said it best-making a movie is the best  electric train a kid ever had.""

According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, (Livingston) alleged this in an  article entitled, ""The Dangerous Area,"" contributed to a recent  issue of the publication ""Sea Power,"" published by the Navy  League, an organization supported by the U.S. Navy.    Stressing that the North Korean leadership which triggered a  war on the Korean peninsula on 25 June 40 years ago is the Kim  Il-song system, (Livingston) said that ""the ROK is very  vulnerable to North Korean attack, and therefore, it is very  clear that Seoul, the fourth largest city in the world  approximately 60 km away from the Military Demarcation Line  [MDL], will undergo enormous damages at the initial stage,  whatever type of war may break out there in the future.""    He estimated that if the ROK Army fails to check the North  Korean Army midway, the North Korean fighters will reach Seoul  within five minutes and tanks will pressure Seoul in its  outskirts within an hour.    In particular, he assumed that North Korea has stored an  enormous quantity of chemical weapons in the areas near MDL in  the North Korean side of the Armistice Line, and will likely  blow off the poison gas to South Korea in an emergency by taking  advantage of weather conditions, including wind, and that some  of these chemical weapons might have already been hidden in  secret places in Seoul or other areas of the ROK.    SANKEI SHIMBUN wrote that this suggests the possibility that  armed spies, who will commit a terrorist act with chemical  weapons at the directive from Pyongyang, might have already  infiltrated into Seoul, or the forces that blindly follow North  Korea might already possess these weapons.

0,FT931-12869 ,"FT931-12869 _AN-DA0B8AB8FT 930127   FT  27 JAN 93 / Technology: Emission-free car shows its mettle      By KENNETH GOODING   With the big three US car makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, ready to co-operate more closely on the development of an electric car, metal producers are watching developments with great interest, as electric vehicles promise big new markets for both lead and nickel. Inco, the Canadian group, reckons that by 2000 there will be 200,000 to 500,000 electric vehicles produced each year to meet legal requirements. Given the short time-scale of the tough emission laws in California, and with other states considering whether to follow, car makers see electric vehicles as the only available technology to give immediate pollution-free driving. To meet the challenge, the Advanced Lead-Acid Battery Consortium (Alabac) was formed in the US. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry also has an electric vehicle battery programme. With tentative plans to keep conventional cars out of the polluted centres of European cities, Fiat of Italy and Peugeot of France estimate that by 2000 there will be a European market for 250,000 electric vehicles a year. For nickel producers, this means the search is being speeded up for better rechargeable batteries - to take vehicles further and faster, charge more quickly and need charging less frequently. Five different types (nickel-cadmium, nickel-iron, nickel-zinc, nickel-hydride and nickel-sulphur) are under study. Competition is mainly from standard lead-acid and more advanced batteries under development, such as sodium sulphur or lithium systems. Inco believes a new nickel market of 25m lbs to 60m lbs a year would be created; present nickel consumption in batteries is probably less than 22m lbs. Altogether, countries outside the former eastern bloc will consume about 1.5bn lbs of the metal this year. Lead-acid battery producers are also enthusiastic about electric vehicles. At the Alabac headquarters in Durham, North Carolina, experts reckon this type of battery offers the only affordable alternative to the internal combustion engine in vehicles. 'If society is to make a big impact on pollution from cars, a large number of people have to switch to electric or hybrid cars. And only electric cars with lead-acid batteries can be priced within reach of large numbers of the population,' says John Sharpe, an Alabac official. Alabac makes no estimates about future demand, but the potential for lead producers can be judged from the fact that today's conventional battery in a US car weighs between 60 and 70 lbs. Lead-acid battery packs in an electric vehicle would weigh between 600 and 800 lbs, while there would be about 400 lbs of batteries in a hybrid vehicle. Most of the weight is accounted for by the lead content. Today, about 5.5bn lbs of lead, or 60 per cent of that consumed, is used in batteries, of which about 1.1bn lbs is used in the production of new cars.   Countries:-  USZ  USA.

According to  police, a new route is being used by the Colombian and Bolivian  cartels to transport the drug through Brazil. The drug enters  the country at Ponta Pora, then is transported to Dourados,  where it is hidden in spare parts of cars. The cocaine then  leaves Mato Grosso do Sul on the main highway to Sao Paulo.

This  is the title of a large article published in a newspaper of a  Western country that is known for its efforts to end the war in  Bosnia with ""legitimate violence."" This title is reminiscent of  the Sarajevo Olympics slogan (""It was nice in Sarajevo, see you  in Calgary!""). The message of this headline is a symbolic  transposition of a successful model since everybody is convinced  now that the Sarajevo model is the achievement of his life. All  the participants in the Sarajevo action think that they scored  diplomatic and other victories, which is a very sincere opinion.    The atmosphere created by the feelings of victory is to a  certain extent a logical consequence of the high tension caused  by the threat of a general war, which would have been a defeat  for most of the participants and observers of the Sarajevo  tragedy. All this contributed to the unfolding of events in a  way that was inconceivable only 10 days ago. The winners are  the Serbs, the Muslims, NATO, Russia, the tortured inhabitants  of Sarajevo, the prophets who predicted the end of modern  coalition monsters, and the cautious. The euphoria was  expressed in different ways. The most influential were the most  successful in convincing world audiences that the solution to  the Sarajevo drama was a historic victory of the suspicious  institution of ultimatum. After the euphoria had died down, it  was seen that the story about ""the Sarajevo model"" was a  complicated matter, and that this model is applicable only if  the stones are put very carefully together, and this only once.  The transfer of experiences is possible, but the transfer of  the whole operation is, however, impossible. It must be  realized that there is no universality in a recipe that may have  been successful in one case.    It does not seem that the West is quite convinced that  everything functioned according to the law of cruel war  blackmail. In spite of this, the Alliance wants to try out its  concept -- which consists of threatening force and of creating  good reasons to avoid its use in the end -- on other Bosnian  towns. The phenomenon of revenge against one warring faction  dominated in Sarajevo, but the aim in Tuzla is quite different,  although it might also include revenge. It is claimed that Tuzla  airport is the key to the control of events in the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, but this may be only partially true.  Closer to the truth might be the formula that there is a  combination of direct interests and exertion of pressure through  escalation, a combination in which every move follows from the  previous one. Apart from the ultimatum (which is in a certain  sense already set), in the case of Tuzla there is also the  element of real provocation directed toward Serbia and the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This has not been confirmed in  public (yet), but nor has it been denied.    Tuzla airport is more important closed than open. If it is  open, there is no great and dangerous theatrical performance  around it -- which must have the dimensions of a exciting war  story in order to be of interest to the audiences and to result  in expected reactions. If the Serbs do not yield to the  blackmail, the airport will be opened by force. Many analysts  think that such a move (legitimate violence) would have  considerably more serious consequences than the hypothetical  chase after Serbian guns around Sarajevo. The deadline set by  NATO for the opening of Tuzla airport is 7 March. This is proof  that there is a difference in the procedure between Sarajevo and  Tuzla. In case of Sarajevo Butrus-Ghali asked NATO to prepare a  bombing action. In case of Tuzla, however, NATO asked  Butrus-Ghali to act and took on the privilege for itself to  support the action from the air. Basically, NATO dictated the  rules of the game in both cases, though without having two basic  pieces of information. First of all, whether its dictate was at  all accepted, and second, how it would behave if its offer to  support the action from the air was flatly refused. The  Sarajevo action was explained with a series of humanitarian  reasons and with the destiny of approximately 200,000 people,  while the ""Tuzla operation"" on the other hand is explained with  the necessity of having an airport, without mentioning that  there are people in Tuzla, too -- just as in Sarajevo. In this  case predominantly Serbs.    Careful observers of the events in Bosnia are afraid of the  future, of the announced spring offensives and of the  restoration of the unnatural love between the Croats and the  Muslims. The announced NATO violence against the Serbs in  eastern Bosnia, supplies of weapons to the Muslims, and the  increased presence of the West on the Drina River would have  give a unique sense of threat to all Serbs. For this reason  Tuzla is a critical point for the war caravan in the Balkans.  Will everything be stopped at the last minute? Is it enough to  rely on energetic diplomatic help from Russia? An ultimatum is  not allowed as a means of exerting pressure, but it is  convincingly dangerous because it functions in this way, since  it is always possible to use force in the end.    Not only the Serbs, but the whole world will some day be  confronted with the dilemma as to what point agreements cannot  be made any more, and when methods of humiliation should be  used. Sarajevo became history a long time ago. Tuzla might be  the town of the biggest drama, and it is important that  everybody knows what he has to do until the climax is reached.  [sentence as published] The night between 20 and 21 February was  declared the night of general victory, and this may be the best  sign that no new deadlines should be set, because there is  always enough time for defeats. There have been a few wars that  ended through an ultimatum, but some of the biggest started  exactly in this way.     "

(ii) On a monthly basis, the Administrator will calculate   the HC and NO    X     failure rates for each exhaust engine family and   notify each vehicle manufacturer, as applicable, of the results   for their engine families.   (iii) Within thirty days after a liability threshold for an   exhaust family has been determined to be exceeded, the   Administrator shall, by registered mail, notify the manufacturer   of the affected vehicles and managers of enhanced I/M test   facilities required to meet the requirements of 52.2963.   (g)     Enhanced ILEV fleet program.   (1) Fleet operators which control 10 or more vehicles which   operate at any time in the South Coast Air Basin Nonattainment   Area for Ozone as defined in 40 CFR 81.305 shall determine   whether they are a covered fleet operator. This determination is   to be made as follows:   (i) The fleet operator shall not count the following types   of vehicles:   (A) Vehicles with a GVWR greater than 26,000 pounds;   (B) Law enforcement and other emergency vehicles;   (C) Nonroad vehicles;   (D) Vehicles garaged at a private residence that are not   centrally fueled;   (E) Vehicles held for lease or rent to the general public;   (F) Vehicles held for sale by motor vehicle dealers   (including demonstration vehicles); and   (G) Vehicles used for motor vehicle manufacturer product   demonstrations and tests.   (ii) Fleet operators shall determine the number of vehicles   not exempted in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section that can be   centrally fueled (as defined in 40 CFR 88.30294).   (iii) If a fleet operator determines under paragraph   (g)(1)(ii) of this section that 10 or more non-exempt vehicles   can be centrally fueled, then the fleet operator shall be   considered to be a covered fleet operator.   (2) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section,   covered fleet operators acquiring vehicles to replace vehicles   meeting the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, or   acquiring additional vehicles which meet the same provisions,   shall acquire a number of enhanced ILEVs equal to the number of   such vehicles acquired multiplied by the appropriate percentage   as follows:   (i) For model year 1999 light-duty vehicles, light-duty   trucks, and medium-duty vehicles, 50 percent;   (ii) For model year 2000 and later light-duty vehicles,   light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles, 70 percent.   (3) Enhanced ILEV purchase credits.     Covered fleet   operators may satisfy the enhanced ILEV purchase requirements   provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section wholly or in part by   redeeming an appropriate number of enhanced ILEV purchase   credits. Enhanced ILEV purchase credits may be generated as   follows:   (i) A covered fleet operator which purchases enhanced ILEVs   in excess of the enhanced ILEV purchase requirement may receive   one enhanced ILEV purchase credit for each excess vehicle; and   (ii) A covered fleet operator which purchases enhanced   ILEVs earlier than required may receive one enhanced ILEV   purchase credit for each such vehicle.   (iii) The Administrator shall issue a credit document or   documents to a covered fleet operator which requests enhanced   ILEV credit or credits and which provides evidence of the   appropriate purchases.   (iv) The Administrator shall approve the reduction of any   covered fleet operator's enhanced ILEV purchase requirement by a   number equal to the number of credits presented to the   Administrator for redemption, subject to confirmation of the   legitimacy of the credit documents so presented.

This was  followed, in the same place, by another seminar organized by  UNICEF, the Kazakhstan Ministry of Health and the Bobek  Children's Charitable Fund. This time, the talks revolved around  the subject of a program of controlling pneumonia among children  in Kazakhstan. What prompted such representative meetings of  physicians in Alma-Ata? At the newspaper's request, Aman  Duysekeyev, deputy health minister of the Republic of  Kazakhstan, shared his thoughts:    First, let me cite some figures: in our republic 40 children  are born per hour, but there is also one death per hour, which  is indicative of high infant mortality. Analysis of child  morbidity revealed that it has risen everywhere. For example,  the highest incidence of infectious diseases is noted in  Kzyl-Orda and Mangistau oblasts, and the city of Alma-Ata. Most  often, blood and hemopoietic organ diseases are detected in the  above-mentioned oblasts, as well as Semipalatinsk Oblast. In our  opinion, the rise in morbidity among tots is related, first of  all, to the poor ecological situation in this republic and  worsening of the people's socio-economic status.    Infant mortality is one of the most sensitive indicators of  socio-economic development of society, which comprises the  educational and cultural level, condition of the environment,  efficacy of preventive measures, medicogenetic consultations,  availability and quality of medical care, distribution of social  and material wealth. It has been established that the highest  indictors of infant mortality are observed in oblasts with a  high birthrate, since they have the poorest obstetric and  pediatric care resources, and lowest per capita consumption of  basic foods. And this enables us to conclude that planning of  resource capabilities of mother and child care services was  carried out for many years without consideration of the regional  distinctions (in the sense of high or low birthrate). True, for  the last few years emphasis has been placed on the regional  conception of distribution of resources. But the difficult  socio-economic situation, reduction in funds allocated to  medicine from the State budget have diminished the capacity to  carry out the work that was begun. Yet we are dealing with  children. Today, more than ever, safeguarding their health  requires effective government support.    What else causes infant mortality? Studies carried out by  the  Kazakh Scientific research Institute of Pediatrics show that the  more abortions are used as a birth control method, the higher  the gynecological pathology, the more often there are  complications of pregnancy, considerable share of premature  infants, while the risk of infant mortality increases 20-fold.  The physical condition and morbidity rate of children,  particularly in infancy, is also directly related to how they  are fed. Yet requirements such as keeping mother and infant  together in maternity homes, and immediate nursing of the infant  are not followed actively enough in Kazakhstan. And this can  ultimately lead to catastrophic rise in number of infants  deprived of maternal milk. Even now, in this republic only half  the infants up to the age of 3 months and one-third of those up  to 6 months old are breast fed. This cannot fail to cause alarm.  Especially since the prognosis is depressing, since Kazakhstan  does not have its own baby food industry, and support of breast  feeding involves major socioeconomic difficulties.    In most of the world's nations, including CIS states,  prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases is one of the  pressing socio-medical problems. In our republic, for example,  bronchopulmonary pathology among children constitutes more than  64 percent of all diseases. Thus, the rise in incidence of acute  pneumonia among tots in Atyrau, Zhezkazgan, Kzyl-Orda and South  Kazakhstan oblasts is attributable to inadequate supply of  necessary equipment to the roentgenological service,  difficulties in making the exact diagnosis, and problems of  professional training of pediatricians, particularly on the  primary level.    The high incidence of pathology of respiratory organs among  children is related not only to unsolved medical, but also  socioeconomic, ecological and ethnic problems. For this reason,  only a comprehensive approach is needed to solve this problem.  In recent years, many scientists have concluded that it is  important to instruct mothers on first medicosanitary aid. As  shown by studies, the education of moms was instrumental in  establishing a health lifestyle, expanding knowledge about acute  respiratory infections, and helped lower infant mortality by 29  percent. Consequently, we consider primary prevention and  hygienic education of the public to be the chief role of  out-patient and polyclinic institutions.    At this stage of economic and social transformations, and  with changing demographic processes, the most important task to  health care practice is to preserve the life of every infant.  And I should like to state through AZIYA, which devoted a page  in its preceding issue to the problem of mother and child health  the following: everything we discussed above will be only a good  intention unless funding of health care in Kazakhstan is carried  out on the basis of scientifically validated forecasts and more  generous investment in programs that guarantee the health of  children and women.

""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,"" which grossed $130 million at the  box office, shrinks to only $22.99 on tape. That includes the Roger Rabbit  cartoon ""Tummy Trouble,"" which also accompanied the film in theaters.    Starring Rick Moranis, Matt Frewer, Marcia Strassman, Amy O'Neill and Robert  Oliveri, the fantastic comedy shows what four kids encounter as they travel  across a yard after being reduced to bug size. If you don't expect anything too  profound, this Walt Disney release (rated PG) is a lot of special-effects fun  for the whole family.    There's also something special in the new-release racks for fans of the late  Bette Davis. MGM/UA has come up with six more of her films from the '30s and  '40s for $19.95 each:    * ""Dangerous"" (1935). The actress won her first Oscar for her part in this  enjoyable soaper.    * ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"" (1941). Remarkable both for being a comedy (she  made few) and for Davis' part being smaller than usual during this period, this  was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play, also starring Monty Wooley.    * ""Deception"" (1946). Powerful melodrama about a pianist and the jealous men in  her life (Claude Rains and Paul Henreid).    * ""The Great Lie"" (1941). In this one, Mary Astor's the pianist (and Oscar  winner) battling Davis in a tumultuous romance-and-tragedy soaper.    * ""In This Our Life"" (1942). John Huston directed Davis as a woman who  threatens to ruin the life of her sister (Olivia de Havilland).    * ""A Stolen Life"" (1946). This time Davis plays both sisters in a soap opera  about twins in love with -- you guessed it -- the same guy.    Also just out:    ""Little Monsters"" (MGM/UA, $89.95, PG). Comedy for young fans of Fred Savage  (""The Wonder Years"") only.    ""A Dangerous Life"" (J2, $79.95). Even though it stars Gary Busey, this  made-for-TV film isn't a documentary about his helmet-less motorcycle wreck;  it's a drama about the change of power in the Philippines.

""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,"" which grossed $130 million at the  box office, shrinks to only $22.99 on tape. That includes the Roger Rabbit  cartoon ""Tummy Trouble,"" which also accompanied the film in theaters.    Starring Rick Moranis, Matt Frewer, Marcia Strassman, Amy O'Neill and Robert  Oliveri, the fantastic comedy shows what four kids encounter as they travel  across a yard after being reduced to bug size.

Hyundai Corporation, the group's trading arm, reported that net earnings rose by 3.7 per cent to Won5.45bn (Dollars 6.7m), although sales fell by 1.6 per cent to Won11,000bn as overseas shipments were disrupted by strikes affecting several Hyundai companies last summer. Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest car manufacturer, had a 39 per cent increase in net profits to Won58.2bn as sales rose by 18 per cent to Won7,180bn due to strong exports benefiting from a weak Korean Won. The domestic car sales division, Hyundai Motor Service, suffered a 32 per cent drop in net profits to Won17.3bn as low-interest consumer financing offered by the company to boost sales put pressure on earnings. Sales increased by 20.9 per cent to Won3,903bn. Hyundai Engineering and Construction had a 9 per cent increase in earnings to Won20.7bn as sales rose by 3 per cent to Won2,774bn. South Korea's largest shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, reported that net profits declined by 21 per cent to Won221bn in 1993 as sales fell by 12 per cent to Won2,170bn. The results reflected lower profit margins on ships ordered in 1992 and delivered last year. Industrial disputes at the shipyard last summer also depressed sales. However, HHI, which is seeking a listing on the Seoul bourse, remains the subsidiary with the largest profits in the Hyundai group. Hyundai Precision  Industry, the world's leading container manufacturer, had a loss of Won48.9bn in 1993 against a profit of Won5.5bn in 1992 due to a drop in exports. Sales, however, increased by 6.3 per cent to Won1,340bn. Inchon Iron  Steel had a 20.5 per cent fall in profits to Won11.5bn, although sales rose by 18 per cent to Won1,083bn. It blamed the earnings decline on a rise in the international prices for scrap steel. Hyundai Pipe, the nation's largest steel pipe maker, had a loss of Won4.9bn against a profit of Won1.2bn in 1992. It blamed the earnings drop on price competition from manufacturers in developing nations. Sales increased by 24 per cent to Won321bn. Hyundai Wood Industries, a timber and furniture company, had a loss of Won4.5bn against a profit of Won1.9bn in 1992. Sales rose by 22.6 per cent to Won397bn. Keum-Kang Development, an owner of department stores and hotels, took a loss of Won4.9bn against a profit of Won3bn in 1992.   Companies:-  Hyundai Corp.     Hyundai Motor.

Assistant Principal Commissioner II Hassan Mutalip, chief of  the Kuala Lumpur Office of Criminal Investigation, said that  during the police raid the police also seized a variety of  heroin processing equipment and a large quantity of drugs.    It is thought that the heroin seized weighed about 20 kg,  including what had not yet been processed.    When Assistant Principal Commissioner Hassan Mutalip met  with  reporters in Kuala Lumpur on 25 January, he said: ""Earlier this  afternoon at around 1300 a police detachment from the Capital  Anti-Drug Branch raided a block of flats at Winner Court B in  Petaling Village Center.""    ""In the building police arrested two men and one woman in  their 20's.""    ""Also during the raid the police seized eight blocks of  material containing heroin which had not yet been processed and  a large quantity of processed heroin.""    Hassan said that the police believe that the flat which was  raided was used by the men and the woman involved to process  heroin there.    However, he said, the police are still investigating to  determine how long the men and the women were processing heroin  there.    According to him, the police are still interrogating the men  and the woman who were arrested and will charge them under  Section 39B of the Dangerous Substances Act of 1952, which  carries the mandatory sentence of death by hanging if they are  found guilty. It is thought that the men and woman who were  arrested are members of a heroin distribution syndicate in the  Lembah Klang area.    It is believed that the men and the woman converted the flat  into a heroin processing center because it was outside the more  crowded, central area of Lembah Klang.     "

Although that territory is known to be surrounded by mines  on  one side and by a fence on the other, they were not torn to  pieces by an explosion. Their bodies had numerous knife wounds,  revealing that their last minutes on earth were pure hell.    Initial investigations indicate that their murderers were  Eglis Rojas and Diorbis Rodriguez, who promised to lead the  couple in May to the military enclave through a safe route in  order to emigrate with all the advantages that the U.S.  Government grants to ""illegal"" Cubans.    The Cuban population now awaits the trial and suspects that  this is not the only incident of its type within the context of  the abnormal relations between Cuba and the United States that  promote human tragedies ranging from family separations to even  death due to maritime journeys aboard inappropriate vessels.    Official U.S. sources reported that in 1993 some 3,000  people  left Cuba illegally to reach the U.S., risking their lives in  the treacherous gulf currents, because they knew they would be  well received and would obtain legal residence, as opposed to  citizens from other countries.    Paradoxically, the U.S. Interests Section in Havana has  become a tight filter through which it is difficult to pass  Cubans wanting to travel to the U.S. (for temporary or permanent  stay). Local sources said that in 1993 only 1,600 island  residents were granted U.S. visas, although an agreement allows,  since 1987, the legal entrance of up to 20,000 Cubans each year.    A simple look at the surroundings of the Interests Section  here shows that there is no shortage of candidates to fill that  quota. Visa seekers wait for days in a nearby park, known as  ""the park of laments,"" where the most common phrase heard is  ""they rejected me.""    In practice, U.S. immigration policy has led to a  progressive  increase in the number of illegal emigres, especially since 1989  when the island started to feel the effects of the U.S. blockade  with even greater force because Cuba lost the traditional  support of the now defunct European Socialist bloc.    The Cuban economic crisis, the privileges granted to Cubans  in the U.S., and the limited revenues through legal means  produced an explosive but attractive mixture [coctel] for  thousands of people who risked their lives (and may have lost  them) in the past years, traveling on improvised vessels, the  so-called ""rafters.""    In the case of the double murder in Guantanamo, there is an  additional factor: the existence of 117.5 square km controlled  by U.S. soldiers by virtue of an agreement, which will be 91  years old on 3 July 1994, that is repudiated by local  authorities.    This naval base was rented as a result of the occupation by  U.S. forces in the past century. It is today one of the main  trouble spots between Cuba and the United States.    Cuban sources reported more than 12,500 provocations since  1962 ranging from shootings (some of them mortal for Cubans),  the movement of armored vehicles a few centimeters from the  borderline, and naval and airspace violations    Out of the total territory occupied by the United States, a  scant 94.4 sq km are on firm land, 38.8 on water, and 29.4 on  swamps. They are, however, well guarded and protected by the  Armed Forces of two countries, which have virtually been at war  for the past three decades. This makes it almost suicidal to  try to enter this territory.    The United States, which maintains the enclave on the basis  of a treaty signed in 1903, does not comply with the provisions  of this same document; for example, the provision that  establishes that Cubans who illegally cross the demarcation  boundary must be returned.    Media sources in Miami have estimated that approximately  4,000 Cubans have risked their lives since the victory of the  revolution by crossing the boundaries to savor all the benefits  offered by U.S. authorities to all ""illegal"" Cubans.    The [U.S.] Congress approved the Cuban Adjustment Law in  1966, which allows all Cubans ""under oath"" to enter, obtain work  permits and other benefits, including the obtainment of their  permanent residence, one year and a day after they arrive.    They do not have to be sponsored by any relative, nor do  they  have to request political asylum, for which most would not  qualify because their reasons are eminently economic or based on  their desire to rejoin their relatives.    Ernesto Porte's and Gleidis Pena's unfortunate demise is not  unique. Until now, no Cuban or U.S. source has attempted to  give an exact report on how many Cubans have died in the journey.    In the Guantanamo crime's case, the murderers were  discovered  because the 20,000 pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official  exchange rate) were given to the alleged guides by one of the  murdered man's brothers after his [brother's] driver's license  was presented as evidence that the operation had been successful.    But a question still remains unanswered: How many of those  who have disappeared have really been victims of unscrupulous  traffickers?    Probably the answer will never be known. However, it is  quite clear that illegal departures are a lucrative business and  that criminals from both countries are involved in it.    The Ricky Robert Hoddynott case is proof of this. Hoddynott  is a U.S. citizen who resides in Key West, Florida. He was  injured and arrested at the Cojimar fishing town near Havana,  last year, when a border patrol foiled his attempt to illegally  take people out of the country on his yacht called ""Midnight  Express.""    Hoddynott confessed that he was in the business of smuggling  people and that he charged between $5,000 and $10,000 per  person. Cuban authorities have asserted that he is not the only  one to make profits from the difficult Cuban-U.S. relations by  offering a trip to paradise that many times ends up in hell.     "

0,FT941-12110 ,"FT941-12110 _AN-EBADGAD9FT 940201   FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Ideas man emerges from the shadows - Pischetsrieder Profile      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES   There is more than relative youth to help distinguish the 45-year-old chairman of BMW from his peers in the top ranks of German industry. More than most, Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder has shown himself to be receptive to new ideas. He says: 'Anyone who is unable to break away from our way of thinking - a specialist mentality, moulded by education and upbringing - will not be capable of making our industry more efficient.' Mr Pischetsrieder has shown himself capable of putting new ideas into practice. In a 20-year series of production-related jobs he has been instrumental in implementing 'new' ideas such as team working, flexible manufacturing systems and working hours, and the demolition of leadership hierarchies, which are only now being introduced elsewhere in German industry. Following his appointment as chairman in May of last year, BP - as he has come to be known - has also been responsible for the project to build BMW's first US plant in North Carolina. The Spartanburg factory - which is to build a new car for the international market - was not his idea. The project was developed under Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, his predecessor, who ran BMW for more than 20 years. It was also Mr von Kuenheim who had posted a watch on Rover with a mind to buying it. But he had also been observing Mr Pischetsrieder especially closely since 1985, when the Munich-born mechanical engineer returned from a South African posting to take charge of quality control group-wide. BP, then 37, had other options, but the quality control post meant that he would be reporting directly to and working closely with the chairman, popularly known as Mr BMW. A BMW man since joining as a production planning engineer in 1973, BP had been on the main board as head of production for less than two years when his moment came. He emerged unexpectedly, and unknown outside the motor business, at the moment when BMW's star was shining at its brightest. The marque had overtaken Mercedes-Benz as the biggest selling German quality car for the first time. BMW, by its own account, was the only domestic automotive group which last year did not slash its workforce or work short-time. Most important, it was the only one to make a profit. Against such a glittering background, and still in the shadow of Mr von Kuenheim, Mr Pischetsrieder had not achieved a high public profile until yesterday. After he had stepped into the limelight in his own right, his colleagues were at pains to stress that he is his own man, who will stand or fall by the results of the deal to buy Rover. 'He steered all the talks,' one said. 'I would like to make clear that our success is his personal achievement.'   Companies:-  Bayerische Motoren Werke.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

For the  first time, the report shows in concrete figures that, in  reality, there have only been a few cases in which these  environmentally clean vehicles have been introduced even in  cases where the opportunities were very good. On the basis of  the report, the Environment Agency plans to consult with the  relevant government ministries and agencies and then include in  the basic environment program on which it is currently working  the specific number of low-pollution vehicles it hopes to  introduce within a certain period.    Currently, there is not enough demand to warrant  manufacturers' mass production of low-pollution vehicles. This  is reflected in the high prices of such vehicles, and this in  turn impedes their widespread use. Thus, as a last resort to  improve the ever-worsening air pollution in metropolitan  districts in Tokyo and six prefectures, the government has  spelled out a plan to introduce 300,000 environmentally clean  vehicles by 2000. These are vehicles which produce no or very  little exhaust emissions, such as electric cars, those powered  by methanol or natural gas, and hybrid cars combining a  conventional engine with electric power. It is feared, however,  that the government's plan may not be carried out successfully.    Late last year, the Environment Agency's study panel  surveyed  government ministries and agencies, and prefectures, as well as  cities with at least 500,000 inhabitants, and questioned  officials at such public agencies as to what extent they could  introduce low-pollution vehicles. The panel subsequently  analyzed the results of the survey which showed that although,  with proper management, approximately half of the 68,000  vehicles officially used by such organizations could be replaced  with low-pollution vehicles, only 268 such vehicles are  currently in use.    In particular, although approximately 4,000 electric cars  could definitely be used by central government ministries and  agencies, only two, as a matter of fact, are being used as  official vehicles for senior officials at the Environment Agency  and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Survey  results also showed that although hybrid vehicles could replace  all 40 trucks and buses currently being used, not even one has  been replaced.    The report compiled by the Environment Agency's study panel  also touches on the issue of how government ministries and  agencies and local governments ought to use official vehicles  for transporting senior officials. In its report, the panel  urges public agencies to further strive actively toward  promoting the widespread use of low-pollution vehicles.

0,FT941-12112 ,"FT941-12112 _AN-EBADGAD7FT 940201   FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Honda's European strategy wrecked - Honda ditched      By PAUL ABRAHAMS and JOHN GRIFFITHS   Honda's long-term European strategy yesterday lay in tatters. The group's bruised management admitted its chances of being able to develop further its 15-year relationship with Rover appeared remote. But while Mr Shojiro Miyake, president of Honda Motor Europe, said yesterday that it was 'too early' to make decisions about future strategy - requiring also talks with BMW - commercial realities make it highly unlikely that it would seek to pull the plug on the ongoing collaborative projects with Rover. Most important of this is a replacement for the current Honda Concerto and Rover 200/400 models, expected in 1995. Even at this relatively late stage, Honda indicated yesterday that it could 'go it alone' if necessary and build its version at Swindon without supplies from Rover, which will build its version separately at Longbridge. But at a time when Honda itself is under fierce financial pressures, it would make no commercial sense for it to forego the economies of scale arising from Rover's supply of body panels for it and the Honda Accord also being built at Swindon. The belief of Mr George Simpson, Rover chairman - shortly to depart to become chief executive of Lucas Industries - is that collaboration will be wound down gradually, a process likely to take up to 10 years. All sides accept that a period of tension is now an inevitability. But BMW yesterday was giving every sign that, for its part, it had no wish to change any of the projects currently under way. The speed at which Honda's strategy unravelled left managers at its headquarters in Tokyo's fashionable Aoyama district clearly bewildered and resentful. Mr Kiyoshi Ikemi, adviser to Honda's president, Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, explained: 'We did not want to make Rover Japanese. We wanted to increase Rover's Roverness. We wanted it to be more British - that was the way the collaboration would work best.' Although Honda management yesterday did not talk about betrayal, the company dryly commented that successful partnerships should be based on trust as well as synergy. 'Now our partner has been acquired by a competitor we must start to reassess our entire operations in Europe,' said Mr Ikemi. 'Mr Kawamoto has made it quite clear that he has no intention of collaborating with BMW in the UK. We did not want to collaborate with Rover through BMW. Such a collaboration was not called for - we had nothing to gain from it,' he said. Although nothing had been decided, it would be wrong to jump to the conclusion that Honda would break its existing agreements with Rover, said Mr Ikemi. The collapse of Honda's European alliance could not have come at a worse time for the company. Management attention was already fully focused on problems in the domestic and US markets. Whatever European strategy Honda adopts, it will take far more time to draw up than it took for the previous one to unravel.   Companies:-  Honda Motor.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

Lack of political will showed itself in poor allocations of  finances to these agencies and a legal cover riddled with [word  indistinct] and loopholes that gape so wide that entire  battalions of offenders slip through them. A glaring legal  omission being the jurisdiction of speedy law court does not  cover FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] -- hot spots  for drug production and trafficking.    The accumulative effect of the lopsided political will and a  Swiss cheese legal set-up reflects in poor follow-up of  registered cases, lower seizures, and a social climate that  offers no resistance to narco money. Given the fact that around  two-thirds of the heroin produced in Pakistan is consumed within  the country and that the number of drug addicts is on the rise,  reduced seizures do not mean that production or trafficking of  narcotics has been curtailed -- as some members of the Narcotics  Control Division would have the public believe.    From 2,900 kilograms (kg) of heroin seized in 1992, the  figure has fallen to 2,179 kgs in 1993. And when compared to  5,677 kgs of heroin seized in 1991, the quantity seized has more  than halved. Number of cases registered have also fallen  sharply -- from 23,494 in 1992 to a mere 10,296 in 1993.  Quantity of opium seized has also fallen by around 1000 kg. In  1992, 3,422 kgs of opium were seized, but the figure slid down  to 2,421 kgs in 1993, and from 2,850 cases registered the number  was reduced to 1,448 in 1993.    In the case of the charas, the quantity seized reduced from  188,123 kgs in 1992 to 138,097 kgs in 1993. While the number of  cases registered in 1993 were 9,618 as compared to the 20,847  cases registered in 1993.    Successive governments tried to prove their commitment  towards eradicating the drug menace by making all sorts of  speeches. However, no-one worked to develop an effective legal  framework to effectively check this menace. The caretaker  government of Moin Qureshi, promulgated an Ordinance, whereby  the death penalty would be awarded to the drug offenders:  namely the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Ordinance, 1993 whereby  the assets of an accused awarded punishment lesser than life  imprisonment are also liable to forfeiture.    The law against narcotics offences relating to trafficking  provided for maximum punishment of life imprisonment. The  government has decided to amend the law in order to award death  sentence for the drug traffickers or financing the trafficking  of narcotics or offences relating to import or export of drugs  from Pakistan and inter-provinces.    Narcotics offences are mainly dealt with under the following  laws: The Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930; The Prohibition  (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979; The Customs Act, 1969; The  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1989 (Act V of 1898); The Police  Act, 1861; The Opium Act, 1957; The Opium Act, 1878; and The  Anti-Narcotics Task Force Ordinance (XII of 1993).    There are 14 [as published] agencies on Federal and  provincial level that are involved in the enforcement of the  above-mentioned laws. Apart from the provincial police  departments, provincial Excise Departments and the Frontier  Constabulary of NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] all other  law-enforcing agencies come under the ambit of the Federal  Government. The services of the defence forces can also be  utilised for the purposes whenever the Federal Government  decides.    Given the fact that there is such a large number of varied  agencies involved and seven different laws to deal with  narcotics offences. It is not a wonder that a complete  confusion prevails. An offence registered under the Hadd cannot  be punishable by death penalty and an injunction of the speedy  courts is not applicable to the federally and provincially  administered tribal areas; while different laws apply to the  carrier and to the offender who finances the trafficking.    Lack of efficient coordination between the various  government  agencies involved, the [word indistinct] inherent in partial  application of the laws, coupled with the fact that money and  political pressure can delay/change/erase the cases is used by  the offenders to their maximum advantage. Also the Narcotics  Control Board cannot spend the kind of money the offenders use  while fighting legal cases against them. In one case, while the  Ministry used around Rs [rupees] 3 lakh, the offenders spent a  hefty Rs 33 lakh -- and went scot-free.    Not only are the agencies short of manpower but the  personnel  is also not provided with adequate personal security to deal  with dangerous offenders. While the agencies are unable to  coordinate their actions, the drug barons are equipped with the  advanced electronic gadgets for surfeiting the movement of the  agencies.    The law-enforcing agencies have failed to control the  smuggling of acetic anhydride, the chemical used in making  heroin. Previously, it was imported in abnormal quantity but  after its import was restricted, it started being smuggled in  from India. Recently a group of Rangers was booked for  smuggling the chemical from India.    In a bid to give a modicum of sanity to the to the mess, the  President and the Prime Minister [PM] have asked for  recommendations to formulate a national drug policy which  contains a comprehensive legal package. It is stated to be a  long-term policy. The PM's camp wants to make it a consensus  legislation which would fetch them points both at home and  abroad.    To restrict the inflow of drugs in their country the United  States of America made clear its dissatisfaction regarding the  performance of the local anti-narcotics agencies a few years  back and announced the funding of a special tasks force. The  Ordinance for the force was repeatedly promulgated and a number  of officers from the services other than those involved in drug  combat were selected, but the force could not take off.    However, according to sources, the Americans reduced their  funding and in the second half of last year, the Army was asked  to take over the proposed organisation. A serving general is  now heading the force, which is still to commence active  operations. Unless anti-drug operations are supported by the  political will of the rulers, not much headway can be expected  in combating this menace. There needs to be social uprising  against the narco barons and their influence in political,  bureaucratic and professional bodies must be exposed. Otherwise  we will enter the 21st century drugged out of our senses.     "

The police have  declared war on these gangs, on illegal drugs and on drug  trafficking, he said.    ""I cannot say much about the police plans, but we have  identified some 27 gangs linked to drugs and who are operating  in the Corporate Area, the Commissioner told THE GLEANER.    Metropolitan Crime Officer, Senior Superintendent Forbes,  said the thrust in apprehending the drug ""lords"" will be  intelligence-driven. This was in keeping with the recent  statement by Minister of National Security and Justice, K.D.  Knight, that the new type of policing will depend mostly on  intelligence.    Some of the communities identified by the police where the  drug gangs operate out of are: Central Kingston, Tivoli Gardens,  Upper Oxford Street, Hannah Town, Jones Town, Waterhouse and  McIntyre Villa in the Kingston 16 area.    Information reaching THE GLEANER is that some of these  communities are now being probed by the police.    Mr. Forbes said in the past there have been speculations as  to the link between drugs and guns, but the police have now  positively established that there is a link, as in some cases  drug money is used to purchase guns.    The Anti-Narcotic Department of the Force will play a major  role in the drive against these drug gangs. The Division was the  recipient of 18 new motor vehicles and some communication  equipment yesterday.    The vehicles include eight Toyota Corollas, four Isuzu  Troopers, two Isuzu double-cab pick-ups, one Isuzu single cab  pick-up, one Hiace 15 seater bus, one Toyota panel van and one  Isuzu five-ton truck. They were donated to the Ministry of  National Security and Justice by the United Nations  International Drug Control Programme.    Mr. Knight said the police have been working hard and wanted  to double their efforts to combat the drug problem.    Last year, the police recovered 80.79 kilograms of cocaine,  673 pieces of crack, one kilogram of heroin and 123.93 kilograms  of hash oil; and a total of 6,915 persons were arrested by the  police for breaches of the Dangerous Drugs Act.

From United Press International      ANCHORAGE, Alaska      New court documents allege that fired Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood  ""regularly hosted drinking parties"" on Exxon tankers before the disastrous  Alaska oil spill and that Exxon had evidence showing that the skipper and  helmsman were unfit for duty when the tanker smashed into Bligh Reef last year.    The Justice Department filed 300 pages of documents in its criminal case  against Exxon just as U.S. District Court closed late Thursday, and prosecutors  in the environmental crimes section later released the 2-inch stack of papers  filed to substantiate the criminal charges against the oil giant.    Defense lawyers are seeking dismissal of a five-count indictment charging the  Exxon Corp. and its subsidiary, Exxon Shipping Co., with violating the Clean  Water Act, the Refuse Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Ports and  Waterways Safety Act and the Dangerous Cargo Act by spilling 11 million gallons  of oil, killing tens of thousands of wild animals in March, 1989.    Justice Department lawyers provided the most detail yet, alleging that Exxon  knew it had serious crew problems but did nothing to rectify them and guarantee  the safe shipment of oil.    The Justice Department said that in 1985, Exxon became aware that Hazelwood had  been routinely commanding tankers in a drunken state since 1982, and that four  years before the spill Hazelwood was determined suffering from episodic alcohol  abuse and dysthymia, a mental disorder characterized by depression, mood  disturbances, poor concentration, difficulty in making decisions and impaired  job functioning.    Nineteen months before the spill, according to court documents, the Exxon legal  department became aware ""of allegations that Hazelwood had regularly hosted  drinking parties aboard ships; that Hazelwood threw empty Jack Daniels whiskey  bottles overboard; that it was a bad joke in the fleet that it's Capt.  Hazelwood and his chief mate Jack Daniels that run the ship; and that on one  occasion, while leaving Valdez, he went below to his room for a drink and left  the third mate to navigate the ship out.""    The Exxon Valdez crashed into Bligh Reef after Hazelwood, who admitted spending  at least several hours in Valdez bars, sailed the loaded tanker out of Valdez  on a detour around icebergs and turned command over to an unlicensed third mate  and then retired to his cabin.

Defense lawyers are seeking dismissal of a five-count indictment charging the  Exxon Corp. and its subsidiary, Exxon Shipping Co., with violating the Clean  Water Act, the Refuse Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Ports and  Waterways Safety Act and the Dangerous Cargo Act by spilling 11 million gallons  of oil, killing tens of thousands of wild animals in March, 1989.    Justice Department lawyers provided the most detail yet, alleging that Exxon  knew it had serious crew problems but did nothing to rectify them and guarantee  the safe shipment of oil.    The Justice Department said that in 1985, Exxon became aware that Hazelwood had  been routinely commanding tankers in a drunken state since 1982, and that four  years before the spill Hazelwood was determined suffering from episodic alcohol  abuse and dysthymia, a mental disorder characterized by depression, mood  disturbances, poor concentration, difficulty in making decisions and impaired  job functioning.    Nineteen months before the spill, according to court documents, the Exxon legal  department became aware ""of allegations that Hazelwood had regularly hosted  drinking parties aboard ships; that Hazelwood threw empty Jack Daniels whiskey  bottles overboard; that it was a bad joke in the fleet that it's Capt.  Hazelwood and his chief mate Jack Daniels that run the ship; and that on one  occasion, while leaving Valdez, he went below to his room for a drink and left  the third mate to navigate the ship out.""    The Exxon Valdez crashed into Bligh Reef after Hazelwood, who admitted spending  at least several hours in Valdez bars, sailed the loaded tanker out of Valdez  on a detour around icebergs and turned command over to an unlicensed third mate  and then retired to his cabin.

0,FT941-3538 ,"FT941-3538 _AN-ECQAKAA9FT 940316   FT  16 MAR 94 / High pay for the few in a city out of work      By DAVID GOODHART   Just five miles down the road from the jobs summit conference centre in Detroit the brand new Jefferson North Chrysler car plant is a standing affront to much of the G7 debate about job creation. The highly automated plant, which produces the Grand Cherokee jeep, is one of the success stories of the town's revitalised car industry. None of the jobs summit delegates would object to the 200 robots or the automated paint spraying and welding at the plant, which reduces the number of employees to about 3,000. But the policymakers would not approve of the fact that, in a town where unemployment is double the national average at 13 per cent, so much employment is hogged by the securely employed 'insiders'. Average weekly working hours at the two-shift plants are 55 to 60 hours, with average annual take-home pay of more than Dollars 50,000 (Pounds 34,246). Most employees work from 6am to 3.30pm, plus three Saturdays in four. Chrysler and the United Auto Workers union collude to maximise work and income for those already in a job, and until recently most new recruits were relatives of existing employees. Yet Detroit has lost 250,000 auto-related jobs in the past 10 years and there are 23,000 people on the books of the state employment agency who want to work at Jefferson North. A few hundred of them may be lucky if the plant decides to put in the third shift. Anybody who gets a job will find a plant with harmonious working relationships and strong powers for organised labour. The UAW not only has a closed shop, it also has equal representation on the key committees which decide most of what goes on. Mr Charles Matthews, a semi-skilled assembly line operator, who has worked for Chrysler for 30 years, said: 'The hours are long but this is the best plant I've ever worked in.' He retires in two months, aged 55. Unlike some other US car makers Chrysler took on existing workers when the new plant opened up, which meant an average age of over 50. There were big retraining programmes for technicians but training in general seems less important than many summit delegates assume. One Chrysler supervisor admitted that many of the semi-skilled jobs take only about half an hour to learn. There is no job rotation for those on repetitive tasks but most workers are part of a small team and training for less skilled workers concentrates on building up team-working skills. Jefferson North would make only a small dent in Detroit's unemployment problem even if it was maximising rather than minimising employment opportunities. Although the town's prospects are improving, and it has a dynamic mayor in Mr Dennis Archer, the Clinton administration has exposed its unemployment sores to the world by staging the job summit here. In central Detroit the unemployment rate climbs to 17 per cent and blacks aged 16 to 19 have an unemployment rate of 41 per cent. Sobering statistics for those Europeans who thought the American labour market had all the answers.   Companies:-  Chrysler Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT932-11799 ,"FT932-11799 _AN-DD3B1AH9FT 930430   FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (16): New examples on the way - Alternatives / Multi-Purpose Vehicles      By MARTIN DERRICK   Government ministers may have been banned from using the expression 'green shoots of recovery' and Mr Ian McAIIister, Ford's chairman, would only hint recently about 'a stirring of the soil' but motor industry executives are confident that at least one area of the business is heading for substantial growth in the UK and continental Europe: the MPV or multi-purpose vehicle. This is partly because people are looking for alternatives now that high performance and sporty cars have been driven out of reach by soaring insurance rates; partly because once the space, flexibility and comfort of an MPV has been enjoyed, it becomes difficult to revert to a normal vehicle. But mostly it is because of the number of new examples about to reach British showrooms. The current market leader, by a comfortable margin, is the Renault Espace, introduced in 1984 and which in 1992 took 41 per cent of the UK market. The 'one box' format, which allows seven seats and lots of space in a vehicle the length of a medium saloon was so innovative that it is surprising it has taken the rest of the industry so long to catch up. Already Nissan, Mitsubishi and Toyota have launched competitors with the Serena, Space Cruiser and Previa respectively, but next year will see a joint-venture MPV from Volkswagen and Ford and a second joint venture from Fiat Group and PSA which will certainly see the launch of a Fiat, Lancia and Peugeot MPV and possibly a Citroen version too. Last year the Renault Espace accounted for 3,221 of the 7,851 MPVs sold in Britain. This year, Renault expects to sell 4,800 examples in a total market it believes will expand to between 9,000 and 10,000 units. 'Our strategy is to achieve a 50 per cent market share now before the market finally starts to take off as competitor cars reach the showrooms and to retain that leading market share by confirming the Espace as the benchmark or generic model in the sector', says Mr Phil Horton, director of communications. Two variants - a turbo-diesel and an automatic V6 - are available to encourage even more potential Espace buyers, and the company is advertising the model on television for the first time in the UK to reinforce the message. 'The Turbo-diesel is already accounting for 35 per cent of customer orders and the automatic V6 provides the right product for buyers in the Pounds 25,000-plus executive sector', says Mr Horton, who also promises special editions for the summer to boost sales. Nissan's manager of marketing and planning, Mr David Archibold, is even more bullish than Renault about the prospects for the MPV sector. 'We expect it to be a fairly stable market in 1993 with perhaps a modest increase, but next year sales should reach 20,000 units, up 50 per cent, because of all the new products coming onto the market', he says. 'We also expect the market to increase by a further 50 per cent in 1995 in Europe. On the continent, the market is forecast to increase even further than in the UK, but that increase won't happen overnight here because this is a more conservative market. But there is no doubt of the increase in interest in the sector'. Nissan introduced its new Serena last year. Most buyers were previously estate car drivers, according to Mr Archibold. Those same estate car buyers seeking yet more interior space have been identified by Volkswagen as the people most likely to move into the MPV sector. At last year's motor show, VW displayed its Caravelle model on the cars stand for the first time. While the van-based Caravelle is rather larger than most MPVs and very much at the top end of the segment, Volkswagen, like Nissan, found that most of those showing an interest were already estate car drivers, many with larger families unhappy at carrying children without proper seat belts. 'The Caravelle, with its seven or eight seats, all with belts, fulfils a need,' said Volkswagen, although it acknowledged that the Caravelle model was very much a niche product. The company's model in the central MPV sector comes next year, jointly developed with Ford. The other imminent joint venture, between Fiat and PSA, is interesting because of the decision to have an upmarket Lancia version as well as the standard Fiat derivative. This indicates that Fiat executives reckon there is room for an executive version which will offer all the comforts and luxuries of a top-line saloon with the space and flexibility of an MPV. Mercedes-Benz planners have the same thought and showed a concept of an MPV at Frankfurt. However there is no word on whether the project has been given the go-ahead. Unlikely to reach production is Giugiaro's stunning concept for a mobile office, shown at Geneva. The Columbus, with its seven seats, four-wheel drive and outlandish styling, may never be built, although the idea of being able to work on the move interests several manufacturers and specialists. Ford has its Granada Office Car, equipped with fax and telephone, and also offers an Executive Transit van - essentially a luxury mini-coach for groups of businessmen. Others have also prepared similar concepts including Chrysler, based upon the Voyager MPV. But to date executives have been unwilling to pay for the privilege of being able to work and be in constant touch both inside and outside the office. For the time being, the growth area is the straightforward MPV - part car, part people carrier, and part lifestyle accessory. Renault's inspired initial design looks set to lead one of the motor industry's few bright sectors over the next few years, and the company is not concerned at the way others are cashing in on its idea.

0,FT944-10294 ,"FT944-10294 _AN-EKKDMACKFT 941111   FT  11 NOV 94 / Management: Guidelines for safety - A look at ways to combat violence in the workplace      By TIM DICKSON   British employers are neglecting their duty to prevent violence at work, a national charity which specialises in personal safety issues claimed this week. Under the 1974 Health and Safety Act and the 1992 Health  Safety at Work Regulations, companies are legally required to carry out assessments and establish agreed procedures for all types of risk. According to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, however, 'what actually happens is that risk assessment tends to be carried out only for industrial accidents involving machinery or toxic substances; employers do not recognise that personal attacks on staff should be included in this process'. In a bid to raise employer awareness the trust has just published guidance notes aimed at reducing the risks of violence and aggression at work. They have been formally endorsed by the government's Health  Safety Executive, the Confederation of British Industry and the TUC. Until the HSE incorporates violent incidents at work into the revised Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurences Regulations the extent of the problem will be unclear. But the trust believes that workplace violence is increasing faster than violent crime in general and estimates that there are an average of 35,000 incidents per year, three quarters of them assaults on staff by the public. The guide argues that both employers and employees have a common interest in reducing violence, citing the impact on morale, image and recruitment. 'It can also mean extra costs, with absenteeism, higher insurance premiums and compensation payments.' Risk assessment is summarised in five steps: look for the hazards; classify all incidents; search for preventative measures, deciding whether existing precautions are adequate; create a company policy and procedures and put it into practice; check that the measures work - review and, if necessary, revise the assessment from time to time. The trust warns that self-defence courses 'need to be viewed with great caution'. They need to be well taught though 'however much training a person is given there will always be times when that person is not on top form'. Avoidance is the best option: 'In any violent physical contact everyone will be hurt and if an employee responds with active aggression he or she may risk a counter claim of assault.' *Suzy Lamplugh Trust, 14 East Sheen Avenue, London SW14 8AS.

""Four batallions of police and military officials remain on  alert here in anticipation of anti-ethnic-Chinese  demonstrations,"" Medan Military District Commander Lieutenant  Colonel Agus Ramadan told journalists.    This adds up to about 2,600 security personnel.    ""The demonstrations might peak on Monday or Tuesday,""  Ramadan  said.    Tens of thousands of workers staged demonstrations in Medan  Thursday and Friday, demanding an investigation into the  suspicious death of one of their colleagues last month.    The battered body of Rusli, a worker of Rubber industry PT  Industri Karet Deli, was found in a local river one day after he  had led a workers protest in March. But officials did not  investigate his death.    Workers also asked for better conditions and higher wages,  as  well as the right to organize in independent labour trade  unions. The government only recognizes the official All  Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI).    Violence erupted on Friday when security forces tried to  stop  the demonstration, which was heading to downtown Medan.    Some angry demonstrators then pelted shops, factories and  vehicles, witnesses said. The violence appeared aimed at ethnic  Chinese, who are often the target of jealously because of their  general economic success.    An estimated 40 to 50 shophouses and six cars were burnt, at  least 150 shops and houses were destroyed, sources told AFP.    Ramadan confirmed one ethnic-Chinese businessman identified  as Juli Kristanto, or known under the Chinese name Wok Joe Lip,  53, was killed Friday, but declined to give details.    Ramadan said that 120 people were a.nested for their alleged  involvement in vandalism, murder and arson.    On Saturday, an AFP correspondent saw nine armoured vehicles  parking along the main residential areas inhabited by many  ethnic Chinese. A journalist of Medan-based WASPADA daily said  by telephone that dozens of other armoured vehicles were  deployed on the suburban areas.    Most of the shops, private banks, private ethnic-Chinese  schools were closed in that city of 1.5 million, whose ethnic  Chinese community makes up one third of the population.    Lieutenant Colonel Ramadan said that the anti-ethnic-Chinese  demonstration was prompted by workers' dissatisfaction over the  annual bonus which was given before the Muslim celebration of  Idul Fitri in March. There was also news of a  430-million-dollar scam at a state bank involving ethnic Chinese  businessman Eddy Tansil.    Demonstrators also protested against the involvement of the  military in labour disputes, the chairman of the independent  Jakarta-based Welfare Labour Union (SBSI), Mukhtar Pakpahan,  told a press conference Saturday.    SBSI, insisting the strike should be the last option for  workers, was behind the first strike on Thursday, Pakpahan said.  But, he added, ""other parties have made use of the situation  the following day, creating chaos and violent demonstrations.""    Pakpahan called on the government to stop using security  measures as away of dealing with labour.    ""SBSI urges the government not to use the security approach  and [word indistinct] actions to handle strikes,"" Pakpahan said.     "
0,FT932-10986 ,"FT932-10986 _AN-DEFCSAEIFT 930506   FT  06 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Trading interests   YEAR AFTER weary year leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries agree to complete the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and fail to do so. The contrast between their protestations and their achievements is ridiculous. Can anything be done to bring their actions in line with their words? Only last week, for example, the G7's finance ministers and central bank governors stated that 'the further opening of the international trading system is indispensable for maximising world growth. A successful growth strategy requires prompt and appropriate conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Protectionism retards growth and must be resisted.' Meanwhile, President Clinton himself pledged 'exceptional actions' to bring about such an agreement. So why has the round already taken six and a half years with no end in sight? The answer is that the leaders do not mean what they say. More precisely, they mean only half of what they say. They think it would be wonderful for the Uruguay Round to be crowned by the liberalisation of the trade policies of every country except their own. No wonder they find it so difficult to agree. Leaders need to be reminded about the chief purpose of trade, which is to widen opportunities for consumption. The report published this morning by the UK's publicly funded National Consumer Council provides such a reminder. It argues, for example, that EC consumers will pay an average of Pounds 740 extra for each Japanese car as a result of the export restraint agreed by Japan; that anti-dumping duties on electronics goods cost EC consumers some Pounds 1.3bn a year; and that the common agricultural policy raises the food bill of the average family of four by over Pounds 17 a week. Protection saves jobs, say its protagonists. This is a myth, counters the NCC. Jobs may be saved in one industry, but at the expense of jobs elsewhere. Just as mythical is the rather newer idea that free trade threatens the environment. Anyone who knows anything about the former communist countries will recognise this as nonsense. Poverty is an important cause of environmental degradation, while opportunities to trade are among the most important routes from poverty. Most of the NCC's recommendations fall into two categories. In the first are those for liberalisation - of the common agricultural policy, for example. In the second are those for transparency and accountability. How, for example, has it been possible for EC governments to make the Japanese form export cartels against EC consumers? How has it been possible to impose high anti-dumping duties without public fuss? The answer is that neither policy has been open to public debate and assessment. The most important NCC recommendation may, therefore, be its call for an independent body to undertake the evaluation of trade policy measures. Its proposed right of access to non-confidential information for consumer representatives could prove equally important. So long as even well-intentioned policy-makers are locked in a struggle with narrow producer groups, they will grant protection, while calling for liberalisation. The NCC suggests governments should empower consumer bodies to participate in the debate. This would help consumers. But it would also help governments themselves to do what they know they ought to do.   Countries:-  XAZ  World.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Before he became a chiropractor, Stephen Bizal of Newport Beach was -- among  other things -- a competitive gymnast, a stunt man, even a ""human torch,""  diving with his clothing afire into a pool of water for the entertainment of  amusement park crowds.    Dangerous work, as Bizal can attest from the many injuries he suffered along  the way, including a fractured pelvis and a head injury that brought on a bout  of amnesia.    But there's something many of us do every day that can also be hazardous, even  if it's nowhere near as flamboyant: We sit. And sit. And sit. Working on a  computer, talking on the phone, taking part in staff meetings, all day every  day, with hardly any respite except for a trip to the coffee machine now and  then.    Crowds may never gasp at the sight of a worker hunched over a computer terminal  but, Bizal says, in one sense that's even more risky than some of the  spine-tingling stunts he used to do, precisely because we don't consider it so.  We don't train for it, as athletes do with more obvious physical stresses. Nor  do most of us compensate for it with other forms of physical activity.    ""We spend a lot of time being mental creatures,"" he says. ""More and more jobs  involve computers. We're trying to be more efficient, and we've gone from a  high-touch to a high-tech society. Most jobs are tied to intellectual  abilities, not physical ones. And people are getting locked into less and less  motion on the job.""    The more mentally and emotionally stressful the job, the more dangerous  extended sitting can be, says Bizal, who works at Personalized HealthandFitness  in Newport Beach.    ""When you're under stress,"" he says, ""it causes the muscles of your back to  tighten up, and that compounds the problem by cutting nerve flow.""    In that hunched-over position, muscles cramp, nerves get pinched, lungs are  unable to expand to full capacity and blood circulation is impeded. It's no  wonder, he says, that office workers tend to get headaches on the job.    In addition to classic chiropractic cases such as auto accidents or sports  injuries, Bizal says he's seeing more and more clients suffering chronic  headaches, backaches and other problems brought on by extended sitting, poor  posture and lack of exercise.    Bizal's interest in fitness to counteract stress goes back to the years before  he even began his chiropractic studies, when he was a self-styled fitness  trainer, working primarily with business executives.    For most adults, the trouble probably began long before computers became  commonplace. We got into the habit of hunching over our desks way back in  kindergarten, he says, learning to write our ABCs with those big round pencils.  By the time our sixth-grade teachers started scolding us to ""Sit up straight!""  it was too late for many of us to unlearn that improper posture.    ""Sitting places three times the stress on the lower back as standing,"" Bizal  says. ""After you've been sitting a while, as you get tired, you lean forward  with your head, your shoulders start to round a little bit. Your body does what  it can to compensate.""    Today's children are learning bad posture even faster than their parents  probably did. ""They tend to sit around watching TV, playing video games -- and  that just adds to the problem,"" Bizal says.    ""Our bodies weren't meant for this,"" he says. ""We're supposed to be physically  active. Our ancestors were hunters, fishermen, farmers. They used their back  muscles every day. Now we don't.""    Bizal may use the word ""we,"" but he isn't including himself among those who  don't get enough exercise. He works out at least an hour a day, six to seven  days a week. ""My workout regimen is part of my normal workday,"" he says. ""I  schedule it in, because it's important."" Bizal divides his workout time about  equally between weightlifting and cardiovascular conditioning on a bicycle or  treadmill.    Even when he's seeing patients, he tries to avoid remaining in the same  position for too long. When children come to the office, he treats them -- and  himself -- to a handstand or two, just to make things more interesting.    Posture problems can be compounded, Bizal says, by factors such as vision  problems, ill-fitting shoes, excess weight -- even poor mattress support or  sleeping in the wrong position.    ""Sleeping on your back -- on a firm mattress -- is best for most people, with a  little orthopedic support for your neck and knees,"" he says. ""You can get into  a nice neutral position on your side too. But sleeping on your stomach is the  worst, because you have to torque your head off to the side or you'll  suffocate. That can leave you in pain the next morning.""    The best antidote to the problems caused by extended sitting is, logically  enough, regular physical activity, Bizal says. Even just getting up and moving  around from time to time during the day can help to some extent, but it's best  to have some kind of regular workout.    Working out with weights can give tight, neglected muscles a much-needed  challenge, he says. And aerobic exercise improves both lung and heart capacity,  as well as improving circulation in the extremities.    Not only does physical activity counteract the effects of extended sitting, it  can help relieve job-related stresses, Bizal says, by providing an outlet for  the aggressions that can build up.    ""We're physical creatures,"" he says. ""You can't just think stress away. You've  got to get up and move around and give your body the chance to do something  about it.""

Capital spending on the automotive business will be cut to DM6bn (Dollars 3.6bn) compared with about DM9bn last year, the company said after Mr Piech told an employees' meeting in Wolfsburg that job losses and spending reductions were unavoidable. The cuts mark a further retrenchment in VW's ambitious spending plans. The group spent DM9.9bn in the vehicles divisions in 1991 and had planned to spend almost DM12bn last year. Although no details were given of where the spending cuts would fall, VW has announced that development of its new works at Mosel, eastern Germany will be scaled back. Mr Piech, making his first address to the workforce since he took charge on January 1, said the group aimed to make a profit this year in spite of an expected 20 per cent drop in German car registrations. The German motor industry was in its steepest decline since the war and the crisis would continue well into next year, he added. He demanded a fundamental rethink and said hierarchical structures had to give way to team work. Every means of improving results would be brought to bear, he said. Costs would be cut, component prices reduced and productivity increased. Vehicles had to be made less complex, with more common components. The aim was to be able to construct the whole model range on a single construction set. This would improve flexibility as well as save costs, he claimed. He appealed for co-operation and said in future, workers would be treated more as individuals and expected to contribute as 'part of the company family'.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

The decision to create it was adopted by the Council of CIS  States' Heads of Government. As a preliminary step a decision  was made on joint measures to combat organized crime. There is  no time to waste -- despite differences in mutual relations  among the republics, a unified crime-conducive space has  survived in the CIS. Moreover, there is information that  criminal formations have ""spread out"" across the whole of the  former Union. Almost one-third of permanent criminal groups --  and 3,500 of them have been uncovered in Russia -- have  interregional links.    Commonwealth countries have a common problem in the shape of  ""illegal"" business in such lucrative fields as the export of  various kinds of raw materials and cultural treasures;  large-scale bank fraud and the theft and resale of cars; and  extortion, thefts, and attacks on means of transport. A  particular danger is posed by gangs engaged in the illegal  distribution of drugs and firearms and in foreign currency  dealings.    Criminals have ""staked out"" their own areas in each  Community  state. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, for example, are  ""distinguished"" for weapons sales and foreign currency dealings.  All the Transcaucasus republics are famous for their  concentration of bandit formations and also for weapons sales.  And raw materials illegally transit the Baltic states.    The newly created Bureau is a prototype ""Europol."" Its work  will be much more practical than that of Interpol, which is more  reminiscent of a police mail box. The Bureau's main task will  be precisely to combat crime in the CIS (particularly in its  organized forms). This is a task which is intended to result in  a decline in social tension, an improvement in the socioeconomic  situation, and the regularization of the consumer market. It is  also important to ensure that the dangerous processes of the  merging of criminal and economic crime do not gather momentum  and that criminal gang leaders and corrupt officials do not find  a common language. And how is drug addiction and the drugs  business to be eliminated? All this will undoubtedly fall on  the new Bureau's shoulders.    The Convention on Legal Aid and Legal Arrangements in Civil,  Family, and Criminal Cases signed in Minsk 22 January last year  provides a good legal basis for the matters which the Bureau  will tackle. But first the Convention has to be ratified. This  is a task for the new [Russian] parliament, which will be faced  with a whole series of legislative acts.     "
0,FT931-10744 ,"FT931-10744 _AN-DBGABACLFT 930206   FT  06 FEB 93 / Iveco Ford urges no bail-out for Daf      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   IVECO FORD, the truck maker, urged the government yesterday not to 'bail out' Daf, its Anglo-Dutch rival, which collapsed into administrative receivership earlier this week. Mr Alan Fox, Iveco Ford chief executive, claimed in a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that Pounds 750m of debts had been written off by the government when Daf took over Leyland Vehicles in 1987. 'Surely there can be no further government-funded financial support for a company with such a track record,' he wrote. 'We think it right that you do not intend to bail out Leyland Daf because clearly there is too much truck manufacturing capacity available even for an annual market of 50,000 new trucks.' UK new truck sales were only 31,398 last year, 55 per cent down on the peak of 69,234 in 1989. 'Should there be any change in government policy in respect of direct or indirect support to Leyland Daf, then Iveco Ford Truck would look to receive an equal benefit and opportunity,' Mr Fox said in his letter. Iveco Ford, a joint venture between Iveco, commercial vehicle subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, and Ford, the US vehicle maker, lost the leadership of the UK new truck market to Daf two years ago. Iveco Ford itself continued to lose Pounds 500,000 a week 'due to the parlous state of the British truck market,' Mr Fox said. The Iveco Ford truck plant at Langley, Berks, could make 15,000 trucks a year, but was currently 'screwed down to just 6,000. This is why we are losing money'. Iveco Ford Truck incurred losses in 1992 of Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m, Mr Fox disclosed. Leyland Daf Finance, the truck maker's hire purchase and leasing arm, yesterday closed its five UK regional offices.

The air quality planning requirements for CO nonattainment areas are set out in sections 186187 of the Act, which pertain to the classification of CO nonattainment areas and to the submission requirements of the SIPs for these areas, respectively. EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing the Agency's preliminary views on how EPA intends to act on SIPs submitted under Title I of the Act [see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)]. The reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the EPA's preliminary interpretations of Title I. In this proposed rulemaking action, EPA is applying these policies to the proposed South Coast CO SIP, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented.   Those states containing CO nonattainment areas classified as ``Serious'' were required under the Act to submit by November 15, 1992, a plan that provides enforceable measures to achieve annual emissions reductions leading to attainment of the NAAQS by December 31, 2000. The Act mandates other specific plan elements, which are discussed below.   In today's action, EPA is proposing to partially disapprove and partially approve the plan for the South Coast, in accordance with the provisions of section 110(k) of the Act governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 1356513566). EPA is proposing to approve the plan with respect to procedural requirements, employee commute options (ECO) program, and forecast of VMT. EPA is proposing to disapprove the plan with respect to the attainment demonstration, reasonable further progress (RFP), reasonably available control measures (RACM), enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M), VMT contingency measures, and TCMs to offset growth in motor vehicle emissions and meet progress and attainment requirements. The State's submission to address the requirements for the clean-fuel vehicle fleet has been conditionally approved in a separate rulemaking. EPA will also act separately on the State's oxygenated fuel program. EPA is proposing to take no action on the plan's emissions inventory for the reasons discussed below.   b.     Procedural requirements.     Section 110(a)(2) of the Act requires states to provide reasonable notice and public hearing before plan adoption. The SCAQMD satisfied this requirement by furnishing proper notice and adopting the plan at a public hearing held on November 6, 1992. Following adoption by the Governing Board of the SCAQMD, the plan was forwarded to CARB, which submitted the CO plan as a proposed revision to the California SIP on December 31, 1992. On April 29, 1993, CARB submitted a letter correcting certain adoption and implementation dates for measures under CARB's jurisdiction.   c.     Emissions inventory.     Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plans include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory included with the South Coast CO plan generally conforms to applicable EPA guidance (see, for example, Emission Inventory Requirements for Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plans, EPA450/491011; Procedures for the Preparation of Emission Inventories for Carbon Monoxide and Precursors of Ozone, Volume I: General Guidance for Stationary Sources, EPA450/491016; Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation, Volume IV: Mobile Sources, EPA 450/481026d Revised). This guidance allows approval of California's motor vehicle emissions factors (in this case, the EMFAC7EP update) in place of the corresponding federal emissions factors. The methodologies used to prepare the base year and projected emissions inventories, as described in Chapter 3 of the plan, are acceptable. EPA is not proposing to approve into the SIP the State's emission inventories, however, because a different inventory is employed in the federal attainment demonstration for CO, and a new CO inventory has been developed for use in a South Coast SIP revision scheduled for adoption later this year. EPA hopes to be able to approve the revised inventory in the final SIP action and use this new inventory in the final CO FIP.   Moreover, State and local agencies are preparing comprehensive revisions to the base year and projected inventories for motor vehicles. EPA may use some or all of this revised and updated motor vehicle data to amend the attainment demonstration in the final FIP. If the State submits an approvable CO SIP along with acceptable updated emissions inventories for the South Coast, EPA will be able to approve the revised State plan and inventories and substitute them for the federal plan and federal emissions inventories.   d. Reasonably available control measures (RACM). Section 172(c)(1) requires the plans for all nonattainment areas to provide for the implementation of all RACM (including Reasonably Available Control Technology, or RACT) as expeditiously as practicable. EPA interprets this requirement to impose a duty on all nonattainment areas to consider all available control measures and to adopt and implement such measures as are reasonably available for implementation in the area as components of the area's attainment demonstration.   The South Coast CO plan's control measures are presented in Chapter 4, Chapter 6, Appendix B, and Appendix C. The control measures are also discussed below in sections II.C.1.g., h., i., and j. The State and local control measures (with adoption/implementation dates before 2001) are as follows:          MG12, Oxygenated Fuels Program (1991/1992);   ARB4, Improved Certification Requirements for alternative Fuel Retrofit Systems (1992/1992);   MG5, Motor Vehicle Buyback Program (1993/19931997);   MG4, Low-Emission New Fleet Vehicles (1991/19932000);   MG11, Inspection and Maintenance Program Enhancement (1993/1994);   MG1, Zero-Emission Urban Bus Implementation (1992/19942000);   ARB5, Low Emission Vehicles and Clean Fuels Program (1990/19942003);   ARB1, Revised Emission Standards and Test Procedures for Medium-Duty Vehicles and Light Heavy-Duty Engines (1990/19951996);   ARB7, Low Emission Vehicle Standards for Heavy-Duty Engines (1992/19982007);   ARB11, Inspections of Fleet Heavy-Duty Trucks (1992/to be determined);   ARB12, Control of Off-Cycle Emissions (1993/to be determined);   ARB16, Retrofit/Operational Requirements for Locomotives (1993/19921997);   MI7, Eliminate Leaf Blowers (1993/1994);   ARB13, Emission Standards for Utility Engines (1990/19941999);   ARB15, Emission Standards for Off-Road Motorcycles (1992/1995);   ARB14, Emission Standards for Construction and Farm Equipment (1992/19952000);   ARB18, Emission Standards for Off-Highway Vehicles (1993/19952000);   ARB17, Emission Standards for Marine Vessels (1993/19971999);   PB6, Control of Emissions from Petroleum Refinery Flares (1992/1996);   FC1/2g, Transit Improvements (to be determined/to be determined);       "," FR940505-1-00049   FR940505-1-00012        C.

The reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the EPA's preliminary interpretations of Title I. In this proposed rulemaking action, EPA is applying these policies to the proposed South Coast CO SIP, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented.   Those states containing CO nonattainment areas classified as ``Serious'' were required under the Act to submit by November 15, 1992, a plan that provides enforceable measures to achieve annual emissions reductions leading to attainment of the NAAQS by December 31, 2000. The Act mandates other specific plan elements, which are discussed below.   In today's action, EPA is proposing to partially disapprove and partially approve the plan for the South Coast, in accordance with the provisions of section 110(k) of the Act governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 1356513566). EPA is proposing to approve the plan with respect to procedural requirements, employee commute options (ECO) program, and forecast of VMT. EPA is proposing to disapprove the plan with respect to the attainment demonstration, reasonable further progress (RFP), reasonably available control measures (RACM), enhanced inspection and maintenance (I/M), VMT contingency measures, and TCMs to offset growth in motor vehicle emissions and meet progress and attainment requirements. The State's submission to address the requirements for the clean-fuel vehicle fleet has been conditionally approved in a separate rulemaking. EPA will also act separately on the State's oxygenated fuel program. EPA is proposing to take no action on the plan's emissions inventory for the reasons discussed below.   b.     Procedural requirements.     Section 110(a)(2) of the Act requires states to provide reasonable notice and public hearing before plan adoption. The SCAQMD satisfied this requirement by furnishing proper notice and adopting the plan at a public hearing held on November 6, 1992. Following adoption by the Governing Board of the SCAQMD, the plan was forwarded to CARB, which submitted the CO plan as a proposed revision to the California SIP on December 31, 1992. On April 29, 1993, CARB submitted a letter correcting certain adoption and implementation dates for measures under CARB's jurisdiction.   c.     Emissions inventory.     Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plans include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory included with the South Coast CO plan generally conforms to applicable EPA guidance (see, for example, Emission Inventory Requirements for Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plans, EPA450/491011; Procedures for the Preparation of Emission Inventories for Carbon Monoxide and Precursors of Ozone, Volume I: General Guidance for Stationary Sources, EPA450/491016; Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation, Volume IV: Mobile Sources, EPA 450/481026d Revised). This guidance allows approval of California's motor vehicle emissions factors (in this case, the EMFAC7EP update) in place of the corresponding federal emissions factors. The methodologies used to prepare the base year and projected emissions inventories, as described in Chapter 3 of the plan, are acceptable. EPA is not proposing to approve into the SIP the State's emission inventories, however, because a different inventory is employed in the federal attainment demonstration for CO, and a new CO inventory has been developed for use in a South Coast SIP revision scheduled for adoption later this year. EPA hopes to be able to approve the revised inventory in the final SIP action and use this new inventory in the final CO FIP.   Moreover, State and local agencies are preparing comprehensive revisions to the base year and projected inventories for motor vehicles. EPA may use some or all of this revised and updated motor vehicle data to amend the attainment demonstration in the final FIP. If the State submits an approvable CO SIP along with acceptable updated emissions inventories for the South Coast, EPA will be able to approve the revised State plan and inventories and substitute them for the federal plan and federal emissions inventories.   d. Reasonably available control measures (RACM). Section 172(c)(1) requires the plans for all nonattainment areas to provide for the implementation of all RACM (including Reasonably Available Control Technology, or RACT) as expeditiously as practicable. EPA interprets this requirement to impose a duty on all nonattainment areas to consider all available control measures and to adopt and implement such measures as are reasonably available for implementation in the area as components of the area's attainment demonstration.   The South Coast CO plan's control measures are presented in Chapter 4, Chapter 6, Appendix B, and Appendix C. The control measures are also discussed below in sections II.C.1.g., h., i., and j. The State and local control measures (with adoption/implementation dates before 2001) are as follows:          MG12, Oxygenated Fuels Program (1991/1992);   ARB4, Improved Certification Requirements for alternative Fuel Retrofit Systems (1992/1992);   MG5, Motor Vehicle Buyback Program (1993/19931997);   MG4, Low-Emission New Fleet Vehicles (1991/19932000);   MG11, Inspection and Maintenance Program Enhancement (1993/1994);   MG1, Zero-Emission Urban Bus Implementation (1992/19942000);   ARB5, Low Emission Vehicles and Clean Fuels Program (1990/19942003);   ARB1, Revised Emission Standards and Test Procedures for Medium-Duty Vehicles and Light Heavy-Duty Engines (1990/19951996);   ARB7, Low Emission Vehicle Standards for Heavy-Duty Engines (1992/19982007);   ARB11, Inspections of Fleet Heavy-Duty Trucks (1992/to be determined);   ARB12, Control of Off-Cycle Emissions (1993/to be determined);   ARB16, Retrofit/Operational Requirements for Locomotives (1993/19921997);   MI7, Eliminate Leaf Blowers (1993/1994);   ARB13, Emission Standards for Utility Engines (1990/19941999);   ARB15, Emission Standards for Off-Road Motorcycles (1992/1995);   ARB14, Emission Standards for Construction and Farm Equipment (1992/19952000);   ARB18, Emission Standards for Off-Highway Vehicles (1993/19952000);   ARB17, Emission Standards for Marine Vessels (1993/19971999);   PB6, Control of Emissions from Petroleum Refinery Flares (1992/1996);   FC1/2g, Transit Improvements (to be determined/to be determined);       "

0,FT943-16713 ,"FT943-16713 _AN-EGCADAECFT 940702   FT  02 JUL 94 / Motoring: Why diesels score well for value - The latest car league tables      By STUART MARSHALL   If the results of two recent surveys are anything to go by, the diesel car boom in Britain still has a long way to go. Fleet Management Services, which runs many thousands of cars on behalf of companies, puts diesel cars in four of the top five places in its 'best value' league table. And although only 10 per cent of the 63,032 car owners who responded to a nationwide survey for Volkswagen GB currently run diesels, almost 30 per cent said they would buy one next time. Most people know by now that diesel cars save a lot of fuel, especially if they spend a fair amount of time in heavy traffic. Naturally, fleet operators welcome lower fuel consumption. But the bottom line for them is what a car will be worth at four years old with 80,000 miles (128,000km) on the clock. Using a five-year computer forecasting model, which had accurately predicted falling residual values in the recession, FMS discovered that four of the five best value fleet cars in Britain were diesels. First was the Citroen ZX 1.9D Reflex 5-door with total running costs - purchase price, funding, fuel, maintenance and depreciation - of 18.84 pence per mile. Second best was the Vauxhall Astra 1.7 D Merit 5-door (19.16p per mile), followed by the Renault 19 1.4 RL Prima 5-door (19.3p and the only petrol car in the five), Rover 218 D 5-door (19.99p) and Ford Escort 1.8 D 5-door (20.05p). Total running costs over four years and 80,000 miles ranged from Pounds 15,072 (Pounds 3,768 pa) for the Citroen to Pounds 16,040 (Pounds 4,010 pa) for the Ford. The Astra cost Pounds 15,328 (Pounds 3,832), the Renault Pounds 15,440 (Pounds 3,860) and the Rover, Pounds 15,992 (Pounds 3,998). The most important single factor in running costs is how quickly the car's value depreciates. This is something many private buyers, while agonising over dealer discounts and fuel consumption, tend to ignore. Cheapest of the five to buy was the Renault (Pounds 8,695 recommended retail) and the dearest, the Rover at Pounds 10,205. Other prices were: Citroen ZX Pounds 9,345; Escort Pounds 9,800; Astra Pounds 9,995. The Astra was the cheapest to maintain, the Rover the dearest, but the difference this made to overall running costs was marginal. The idea of VW GB's survey was to find out what people expected from the new cars they would buy over the next 10 or 20 years. Apart from diesel economy, occupant protection and vehicle security were main concerns. Perhaps surprisingly, most of the emphasis was on passive safety - mitigating the effects of a crash - and not on active safety features that might help a driver to avoid having a collision at all. Almost 80 per cent wanted airbags and a crash-activated switch to cut off the fuel pump. Speed limiters were demanded by fewer than 40 per cent, sensors to tell drivers they are travelling too close to the vehicle in front by about 50 per cent. Some company car users, with tax saving in mind, have started trading down to smaller, cheaper models. But the trend among retail buyers may be the other way. They could be going for larger, more practical cars; more than 20 per cent said they would prefer an estate as household transport. Increasing car crime put car security high on the agenda. Nine in 10 of those surveyed wanted an engine immobiliser as standard equipment; 65 per cent opted for a computerised tracking device (already offered as an extra by BMW and Saab) to locate a car after it had been stolen. Next week, the two-month consultation period on Ministry of Transport proposals to ban coaches from the outside lane of three-lane motorways ends. Under a European Commission directive, all coaches will be speed-limited to 65mph/105kph from 1996; at the moment, they must not exceed 70mph, but many often do. Most motorists would be delighted to see them banned from the third lane - the sooner the better. For good measure, heavy lorries (already limited in theory if not always in practice to 60mph/97kph) should be kept out of both of the outer lanes of the M25 and other motorways that have been converted to four lanes. Saab and Volvo already have rear centre armrests that double as child safety seats. BMW plans to go further and will offer, probably next year, integrated (but easily removable) safety seats, adjustable for children between nine months and 12 years. They have foot rests, to stop the backs of the front seats from being kicked, and side supports to prevent sleeping heads from lolling uncomfortably. Other ideas BMW has for the family car are fold-out tables with low-line reading lights, that will not reflect in the windscreen, and storage boxes. These can also be plugged into the electrical system to cool drinks or warm babies' bottles.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

General Information      Natural gas is a vapor that is lighter than air at standard temperature and pressure. 1  When used as a motor fuel, natural gas is typically stored on-board a vehicle in cylindrical containers at a pressure of approximately 20,684 kPa pressure (3,000 psi). Natural gas is kept in this compressed state to increase the amount that can be stored on-board the vehicle. This in turn serves to increase the vehicle's driving range. Since natural gas is a flammable fuel and is stored under high pressure, natural gas containers pose a potential risk to motor vehicle safety.            1     Standard temperature is 0   Celsius or 32   Fahrenheit and standard pressure is 101.4 kiloPascals (kPa) or 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi).         Vehicles powered by CNG have not been numerous to date, although they are increasing. The number of CNG vehicles in the United States has more than doubled from 10,300 in 1990 to 23,800 at the end of 1992. The number of CNG vehicles is projected to again double to an estimated 50,800 vehicles in 1994. As discussed in detail in a final rule published on April 22, 1994, establishing Standard No. 303,     Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles    , recent Federal legislation, as well as the need to meet environmental and energy security goals, will lead to increased production and use of these vehicles.

They never expected to receive such a lousy ""New Years  gift."" Scores of vehicles illegitimately using military license  plates fell into the dragnet set jointly by the garrison forces  and military transportation department in Guangzhou, Shenzhen,  and Zhuhai.    Although the flow of military vehicles accounts for less  than  5 percent of the total traffic in the crowded Zhujiang delta,  one can see all kinds of military license plates. In Guangdong,  an official responsible for the transportation section of the  Logistics Department of the Guangzhou Military Region said  military license plates from all parts of the country except  Tibet can been seen here. Experienced officers and men of the  garrison force who are responsible for exercising supervision  over military vehicles can easily spot the counterfeit military  vehicles. In the military vehicle inspection jointly organized  by the garrison forces and military transportation department of  the Guangzhou Military Region and investigated by relevant  departments of the General Staff Headquarters and General  Logistics Department and the Legal System Bureau of the Central  Military Commission, they examined more than 600 vehicles which  had been using military license plates and found that 31 were  using counterfeit military plates or licenses.    Making Use of Military Vehicles To Smuggle and To Evade Taxes    It is difficult to discover where the fake military license  plates are forged, but Guangdong is surely one of the regions  where the practice is running wild. Because of the special  military mission of military vehicles and the preferential  treatment they enjoy in the Zhujiang delta, they are exempted  from highway and bridge tolls. As a result, a handful of people  blinded by greed take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters  and use counterfeit military license plates to gain advantages  at the expense of the state and collective. An individual  engaged in the transportation business said that he would save  annual highway and bridge tolls of over 10,000 yuan with a  military license plate. As Guangdong is a coastal province,  adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, a tiny handful of lawless  elements make use of the military plates to cover their crime of  smuggling, evade supervision by government departments, and  engage in all kinds of illegal activities.    There is great demand for these license plates. Lawless  elements seeking military plates and licenses stimulate almost  wild black market transactions. When a ""Dongfeng"" truck, with a  fake military license plate but without any license, was  intercepted in Shenzhen, a reporter asked the driver about the  source of the fake plate. The driver replied: I bought it for  600 yuan. When asked where he bought the plate, he said: I do  not know. The Guangzhou Military Region tracked down a truck  which was using fake military license plates by following clues,  and discovered an illegal ring involved in selling temporary  plates. The ring sold a total of 39 temporary military vehicle  plates at 10,000 yuan each. As of the time of the  investigation, the ring had illegally made a profit of 390,000  yuan. The black market price of a military license plate could  reach as high as several hundred thousand yuan. In spite of the  high prices, the forging of military vehicle license plates and  illegal transactions are spreading. Regarding the lawless  elements, the illegal gains made from using fake military  vehicles is several to many times higher than the cost paid for  getting a genuine military plate.    Bizarre Dress Used To Pass Oneself Off As a Military Official    To pass oneself off as an owner or driver of a military  vehicle, one must pretend to be a serviceman or staff member of  a military unit. Most of these people appear in the capacity as  a staff member of a military enterprise. When a military  vehicle inspection group was examining a ""Lingzhi"" car with  military license plates at the Shaba toll collection station on  the Guangzhou-Foshan expressway, a long-haired female lieutenant  stepped out. The lady, who claimed to be the deputy director of  a unit of the Logistics Department stationed in Guangzhou, wore  a uniform with unmatched buttons and which was attractive, with  material which was apparently different from the standard. She  explained that the uniform was the latest issue. The servicemen  in the inspection group looked at each other in dismay. When  the inspector examined her ""officer identity"" card, which had  the chop of the management bureau of an ordnance factory, she  begged the female officer: ""Please let me go, I am real."" At  the military vehicle inspection post near the Zhuhai  Banzhangshan tunnel, the driver of a Toyota van, which had a  military plate, presented his ""People's Liberation Army Identity  Card,"" which looked similar to the ""officer identity"" and  ""serviceman identity"" cards. ""XX Real Estate Development Company  of XX Unit in Zhuhai"" was printed on the cover of the identity  card. When the inspector asked the driver some questions about  the identity card, he just smiled and refused to answer.    Huge Profits Result From Mass Production    In an office of the Highway Inspection Section of the  Guangzhou Military Region, this reporter witnessed hundreds of  various kinds of confiscated fake military license plates. Some  of the military plates and documents were of poor quality, and  could be identified at first glance. But the quality of most of  them was good enough to mistake them for real. According to  officials of the Transportation Bureau of the Logistics  Department of the Guangzhou Military Region, the workmanship and  materials used in making most of the counterfeit military  license plates were far better than the ones used in making  genuine military vehicle plates. The forging of driving passes,  driving licenses, officer identity cards, serviceman identity  cards, and staff identity cards corresponded with the forging of  military vehicle license plates. To forge documents, it is  necessary to forge the chops of military units and the officials  responsible for the work. One can easily see the mistakes in  the forged military documents and chops, such as ""Logistics  Department of XX Unit Under General Staff Headquarters"" and ""XX  Unit Stationed in XX Office."" A forged military vehicle license  even made the mistake of printing ""Zhongguo Renmin Jiefang Jun""  [Chinese People's Liberation Army] as ""Zhongguo Renmin Fangjie  Jun."" An officer in charge of producing military vehicle  license plates said that he had already found more than a dozen  forged chops which used his name.    Looking at the military cars and trucks which sweep past and  gazing at the luxurious military cars parked in front of hotels,  this reporter is at a loss: How many of them are genuine?  Undoubtedly there are ""underground factories"" which forge  military vehicle plates and licenses in large numbers. But when  can these dens be smashed?     "

0,FT942-13940 ,"FT942-13940 _AN-EDVCVADFFT 940422   FT  22 APR 94 / Dark horse sets the pace: The carmaker's UK-born chairman      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   It is less than six months since Mr Alex Trotman, an Englishman originally from Middlesex but raised in Scotland, became the first chairman of the world's second-largest carmaker to be born outside the US. As of yesterday, Mr Trotman, who will be 61 in July, will be remembered in the US for much more than his origins. He has set Ford on the road towards a radically new future faster than the latest Mustang which young Americans are falling over themselves to buy - and to whom Mr Trotman has become something of a hero for saving the Mustang from the chopping block of Ford's product planners. The imagery is apt. In terms of Ford's hierarchy, Mr Trotman himself might be described as the dark horse who became the favourite with almost bewildering speed. He surprised many in the European industry by becoming chairman of Ford of Europe in the mid-1980s. His unassuming manner and faintly diffident air - contrasting oddly with his clipped moustache and the outward appearance of a military man - gave few clues that he might be earmarked for the top. His performance at the opening of the New York motor show two weeks ago might have made him an almost unrecognisable figure to former European colleagues - poking fun at his own expense about past 'boring' speeches and handling the ranks of hard-bitten US media men like a music-hall professional. But Mr Trotman has earned his success the hard way in his 38 years with Ford. He started as a 'progress chaser' - expediting supplies - in the purchasing department at its Dagenham plant. He worked his way through jobs which other potential candidates for the top post - the urbane Mr Allan Gilmour, a vice-chairman who had spent most of his career in finance, for instance - might have found unenviable. 'My three years in purchasing was a boot camp,' Mr Trotman recalls. 'But I can think of no better place to learn the auto business. It was immediate and challenging and one of the toughest jobs I ever had. Often I'd wind up driving all night, with my old car filled with a thousand parts to get to the plant in time for start-up.' He joined Ford of Britain's newly created product planning group in 1959 at a time when 'most thought of product planning as a place where guys sat around sipping tea and reading magazines'. However, it was the first step down a career path which has led inexorably to the restructuring plan announced yesterday, which has new product programmes, and their costs and organisation, at its very core. Almost certainly, his product planning experience was the crucial factor in Mr Trotman pipping Mr Gilmour to the chairman's post. He became chief product analyst on project 'Archbishop' - to become the Cortina when it arrived in showrooms. The kudos accruing to Mr Trotman from one of Europe's most successful saloon cars subsequently carried him into the product planning chief's role for Ford of Europe. Since then he has become the only Ford executive to have run all three of its geographical sectors of operation - Asia-Pacific (in 1983-84), Europe (in 1984-89) and North America, where he was head of US operations before leapfrogging into the chairmanship. Most colleagues admire his no-nonsense approach to the business, although his scrapping of executive privileges, such as separate dining rooms, at first rankled with a few. Mr Trotman is happy to meet critics head on. 'I don't mind punch-ups,' he maintains, 'as long as they're out in the open. I won't tolerate cliques or intrigues.'   Companies:-  Ford Motor.

0,FT944-9244 ,"FT944-9244 _AN-EKPEKAFPFT 941116   FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Asset sales hold Volvo on course      By HUGH CARNEGY      STOCKHOLM   The rapid drive back to big profits this year by Volvo's car and truck divisions may have caught most of the attention, but a significant contribution to the Swedish manufacturer's nine-month surplus of SKr12.7bn (Dollars 1.75bn) came from a non-core asset disposal programme that has only just begun. The net gain on asset sales in the first nine months contributed SKr4.2bn - or nearly one-quarter of the pre-tax profit - as Volvo began a strategy of focusing on core motor vehicle operations, adopted following the collapse late last year of a plan to merge with France's Renault. These sales helped produce a marked strengthening of Volvo's financial position over the period. Net debt has been driven down from SKr14.5bn at the end of last year to SKr700m at the end of September, while the group's equity-to-assets ratio has risen from 21 per cent to 30 per cent. This has put Volvo well on the road to achieving the financial strength it needs to underpin the long-term development of its car and truck businesses, now that it is not sharing costs with Renault. The target set for the assets disposal programme by Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, earlier this year was an equity-to-assets ratio of 50 per cent. That target looks as though it will be comfortably exceeded as the biggest plums in the Volvo assets pie have yet to be sold. This year, Volvo sold its interests in Cardo, an industrial holding group, to the Wallenberg empire for a capital gain of SKr2.6bn; Custos, an investment company; Norway's Saga Petroleum; Cultor, a Finnish sugar producer; and Hertz, the car hire group. Still to come, however, are Volvo's residual holding in Renault; its wholly-owned subsidiary BCP, a food and beverages producer; its 27.5 per cent stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceutical companies by sales; and its Swedish investment bank Alfred Berg. At the recently-announced privatisation price for Renault, Volvo's 20 per cent holding is worth around FFr8bn (Dollars 1.5bn). At present market prices, Volvo's share in Pharmacia is worth around SKr9bn. Volvo is wary of putting a price on its remaining assets, but some estimates have reckoned the BCP, Pharmacia and Alfred Berg sales could raise between SKr40bn and SKr45bn gross. Mr Gyll wants to complete the disposal programme by the end of 1996. Under an agreement with the Swedish government, which is the other main shareholder in Pharmacia, Volvo cannot sell its holding in the company until January 1996 at the earliest. Most attention is therefore focused on how and when Volvo will sell off BCP, a company with turnover in the first nine months of SKr15bn and operating profits of SKr1.6bn. Volvo is understood to favour a direct sale to a corporate buyer, rather than a flotation. It says it has been in discussions with up to 30 potential buyers, although the only company so far to declare publicly its interest is Nestle, the Swiss food group. If there is no flotation, the most important issue will be whether BCP is split up or sold as a whole. Its main components are Swedish Match, a beverages division which makes Pripps beer and Ramlosa mineral water, and a food division with a big market share in Sweden. Volvo says price will dictate whether BCP is broken up or sold intact. When the asset disposals are complete, Volvo will certainly be a cash-rich motor company. Then it will have to show that it can achieve the same strong returns on the money in its car and truck operations as it did in its diversified investments.   Companies:-  Volvo.

The effectiveness of the English criminal justice system has been seriously weakened by miscarriages of justice perpetrated at times of public outrage after horrible terrorist bombings. A series of vicious attacks by dogs two years ago produced the Dangerous Dogs Act which has failed to rid Britain of killer dogs but provided lawyers with work defining breeds. There is a similar peril in the present moral panic over the killing on Merseyside of a two-year-old boy, apparently by older children. The intense media coverage has led many to suppose that the UK has become engulfed in a tide of violent crime. Several recent news stories have been cheaply and misleadingly linked to suggest that children are at the forefront of the crimewave. Recorded crime rates have certainly risen, as in almost every other advanced economy. But fear of crime has risen much faster. And there is, sadly, nothing new about children killing other children - as those with memories long enough to remember the case of Mary Bell will know. Such considerations count for little, however, when politicians scent an issue of popular concern. The parties vie to demonstrate their commitment to ever-stronger measures, with little consideration of their efficacy. The prime minister is right to call for greater condemnation of violent crime. But his corollary of less effort to understand the criminal is exactly what is not needed. Much more work is required to examine the many factors which lie behind increased crime rates. These include unemployment, which has left pockets of deprivation in many large cities where crime is seen as the only way of acquiring material wealth. There is the failure of schools which send 40 per cent of students to further education colleges with inadequate numeracy and literacy skills, along with vocational training system still very much in the throes of uncertain reform. There is the erosion of the nuclear family, which provided two adults to share the burden of parenthood. And there is the question of violence in the media, which may create an impression that violence is the norm. There is also the easy availability of drugs, trafficking in which offers financial rewards way beyond those possible through hard work. Those attractions are enhanced at a time of few job opportunities for young people with no qualifications. There will be disagreements over the weight to be assigned to each of these and to many other relevant factors. But anyone who hopes to contribute to solutions must recognise that dealing with this complex issue needs multifaceted policies managed with skill and determination over long periods. That is the note the government needs to strike in the coming days.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.   Types:-  GOVT  Legal issues.

0,FT933-12952 ,"FT933-12952 _AN-DGVCBAGZFT 930721   FT  21 JUL 93 / German car production sinks lower in June      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES   THE slight improvement in German car orders, detected during May, ground to a halt again last month, the VDA automobile industry association said yesterday. June production of all vehicles, adjusted to allow for an extra working day this year, was 29 per cent lower than a year earlier at 344,000. Unadjusted output was down 25 per cent, the association said. Despite last month's setback, the decline in the car industry appeared to have reached the bottom, it added, but conditions for commercial vehicle makers were continuing to deteriorate in a slump which has now entered its third year. June's poor performance brought the cumulative decline in motor manufacturers' output to 25 per cent for the first half of this year. In absolute figures, car production has tumbled 625,000 to 1.975m. Output of light trucks up to 6 tonnes fell 34 per cent or 37,000 units to 72,000 between January and June, while output of other commercial vehicles was down 36 per cent compared with the same period last year. Most manufacturers have dealt with the slump by closing their works for at least one day a week for most of the year so far, while tackling the industry's structural problems with radical cost- and job-cutting programmes. Meanwhile, the industry has been busy reducing heavy stocks of vehicles which accumulated when the forecast recovery in international markets failed to appear at the end of last year. Inventories were further bloated by a sudden slump in domestic demand after the summer holiday period last year, when the post-unification sales boom ran out of steam. The German trade enjoyed a brief surge late last year, inspired by buyers rushing to avoid the effects of a one percentage point increase in value added tax in January, before continuing its decline. There are still no clear signs of overall improvement in Germany, where recession and fear of unemployment are still affecting demand, but there are some indications that foreign car markets may be coming off the bottom. Car exports, which account for around half the industry's output, were 19 per cent lower in June than in the same month last year, after being 25 per cent and 24 per cent lower in the two preceding months. Overall, car sales abroad are 20 per cent down in the six months to the end of June. The VDA, which in May reported a small improvement in car orders for the first time this year, said government plans to increase fuel taxes next January were hampering recovery. At the start of the year most German manufacturers forecast a 20 per cent drop in domestic car sales for 1993 and a decline of around 10 per cent in Europe as a whole. New registrations in the European Community in the first half were down 19 per cent, according to the European motor manufacturers' association.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  German vehicle production and exports                             (Jan-June 1993)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Production              Exports                                1992        1993        1992       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cars                      2,600,091   1,974,600   1,318,685  1,053,000 Commercial vehicles (up to 6 tonnes)            108,985      72,000      52,788     38,700 Other commercial vehicles    78,055      49,600      33,447     23,900 Total                     2,787,131   2,096,200   1,404,920  1,115,600  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: VDA Automobile Industry Association  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

This last week Norwegian authorities have received two  bulletins from the nuclear power plant Polyarnye Sori about  small accidents. On 3 March the cooling system of one of the old  pressurized water reactors sprung a leak. Fifty cubic meters of  cooling water ran out. On an international accident scale of  zero to seven, this accident rated a two. Last Sunday [6 March]  another bulletin appeared: A steam leak and an increase in the  level of radiation was measured at reactor number three that was  then stopped. This accident rated only a zero on the accident  scale.    ""Neither of these accidents was particularly serious.  Neither  of them could develop into anything big. However, there is still  cause for serious concern. They say something about the  situation in general at the nuclear power plant,"" says Ole  Harbitz, the director of the National Radiation Protection  Service.    Dangerous Neighbor    When questioned about whether the situation is critical, he  answers:    ""It is critical that Norway has a neighboring nuclear power  plant that is in such a poor condition. An accident might just  as easily happen tomorrow as in a week or in 10 years. I will  not be surprised if there is a serious accident at the plant,""  Harbitz says. Two of the four reactors at the plant are of a  type that Western experts think should be put out of commission  as soon as possible.    He follows the situation with Argus-eyed vigilance. He is  very worried as to safety. Employees have been paid only  sporadically this winter. Often months have passed between each  payday. Work morale at the plant is consequently poor. And money  for even the simplest maintenance work has been lacking since as  far back as September of last year. This latest accident is a  typical wear-and-tear accident in which parts should have been  replaced long ago.    ""We are aware that there is a lack of money for wages and  maintenance. This is cause for concern. Signals from Kola show  that the risk of a serious accident has not decreased,"" Harbitz  says.    When questioned as to how great this risk really is, he  answers: ""The risk is a product of probability and consequence.  Even though the probability of a large accident might still be  small, the consequences for Norway will be so significant that  the risk still will have to be considered large,"" Harbitz thinks.    Norwegian nuclear authorities have not received any urgent  appeals for technical help from the Kola power plant. ""Moreover,  we should stick to the strategy of helping with repairing only  the most critical deficiencies, but not contributing to  modernizing the plant so that it will continue to operate. Maybe  we can hope that the present problems will lead to a more timely  shutdown,"" Harbitz says.     "

Reactions to the Greens' success  varied, including ""We've found someone to fight--and it's not  nuclear power plants; they pose no danger."" ""The Greens are only  hurting Ukraine's defense."" To get to the bottom of things we  had our correspondent interview Professor Yuriy Danylovych  Dumanskyy, head of the Laboratory of Environmental  Electromagnetic Factors, Ukrainian Scientific-Hygienic  Center.    [Correspondent] Professor, do radar stations really pose a  danger to health?    [Dumanskyy] Radar stations are a big source of environmental  radiation, producing superhigh-frequency electromagnetic fields.  An electromagnetic field is very damaging to living organisms.  In human beings, for example, the central nervous system suffers  (memory is impaired and reactions slow down). It is especially  harmful to children, as we know from studies in Odessa. At high  levels a person suffers from headaches, fatigue, and  nervousness. Men's potency is reduced and women's menstrual  cycle is disrupted. The effect of the exposure accumulates, but  if it stops, the person recovers and the complaints stop.  Especially high levels (more than 10 milliwats per square  centimeter) cause clouding of the eye lens, the heat effect, and  hallucinations. Plant tissues die and, at high levels, burn.    [Correspondent] Is anybody watching over people's safety in  that regard?    [Dumanskyy] Hygienic normatives have been worked out to  ensure safe conditions for people living in the vicinity of  radar stations. On their basis the Health Ministry issued a  number of requirements to radar station owners involving  relocation, and certification of these units is underway.  However, responses to the requirements have been slow. For  example, the Defense Ministry pleads lack of funds. Moreover,  not all units are covered yet--for example, over-the-horizon  stations.    [Correspondent] Who are the owners, and where are the units  located?    [Dumanskyy] Primarily the Defense Ministry, which has  guidance stations, superpowerful space observation antennas, and  PTO [technical service point] stations. The rest are divided  into long-range and high-range (which are especially dangerous  because their rays often ""cling"" to the earth). Radar stations  are also used in civil aviation, maritime operations, and the  weather service.    Radar stations are located in population centers or (more  often) not far away. As a result, worrisome situations have  developed in Lvov, Mukachevo, Ivano-Frankovsk, Dnepropetrovsk,  Nikolayev, Odessa, Yevpatoriya, and Kiev. In Sevastopol the  field is so strong that in some places it makes neon lights go  on.    [Correspondent] What is to be done?    [Dumanskyy] Measures to prevent harmful effects of radar  stations include 1) Moving stations outside of populated areas;  2) Resettling the inhabitants; 3) Changing the stations'  operating modes; 4) Changing the angle of radiation; 5) Setting  up restricted radiation zones; 6) Planting woods; 7) Raising the  station above the locality; 8) Protective structures (banks,  fences, dikes, and so on.

0,FT944-17818 ,"FT944-17818 _AN-EJFD1AD2FT 941006   FT  06 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Brussels' foot on the brake   In proposing to renew the block exemption of motor industry distribution practices from EU competition law, the European Commission says it aims to balance the interests of all involved. But that balance remains tilted far too heavily in favour of producers, at the expense of the interests of consumers and economic efficiency. Furthermore, the Commission's approach raises disquieting questions about its attitude to the single market. Yesterday's decision preserves the central principles of the existing exemption. Manufacturers will continue to be able to choose which dealers they supply and to limit them to selling only one brand at one location, while permitting dealers exclusive franchises within designated territories. Most of the amendments proposed amount to tinkering, not fundamental reform. Some merely formalise practices already common, notably in the UK. They include the right of dealers to stock competing brands at separate outlets and to advertise outside their franchise territories. Other changes seek to tackle some of the more pernicious abuses of the existing regime. For instance, Brussels aims to loosen manufacturers' monopoly over spare parts and to reduce obstacles to cross-border car purchases, repeatedly blamed by consumers' organisations for creating gaping differences in car prices across the EU. However, many of these obstacles are already supposed to be illegal. Brussels' failure to correct them in the past inspires little confidence that the new rules will be enforced any more vigorously. Radical approach A much more radical approach was needed. The Commission should have started by questioning the scope of the exemption. It was originally granted on the grounds that cars are complex products which require big investments in after-sales service facilities. Yet it also extends to new vehicle sales. No convincing economic case has been made for treating the two businesses as one. Doing so impedes efficiency by encouraging cross-subsidies between them. Equally, continuing restrictions on multi-brand dealerships deter innovation in retailing and deny car-buyers the convenience of comparing a wide range of competing models in one showroom. Abolishing these curbs need neither affect manufacturers' power to discipline wayward dealers, nor lead to unhealthy concentration of distribution, provided competition policy were applied effectively. Probably the proposal's biggest weakness, however, is that it relies too much on vaguely worded prohibitions of abuses by manufacturers. It would have been far more effective to have spelt out clearly specific rights to which consumers were entitled. Nowhere is this more so than in the freedom to take advantage of price differentials by shopping across borders. Price convergence Price convergence is one of the crucial tests of a unified market. Car manufacturers have long protested that it has not been achieved because of currency fluctuations and differences in national taxes and costs. But their argument is perverse. Only when producers are compelled by strong cross-border competition to treat Europe as one market will there be effective pressure to abolish regulatory and fiscal obstacles. That is the central purpose of the EU single market programme. The Commission's timid remedies to the obvious flaws in the block exemption suggest that it is reluctant to subject Europe's biggest manufacturing sector to the logic of the single market. Its hesitation is not altogether surprising. For Brussels is itself engaged in the business of using the exemption to manage trade in cars within the EU. The exemption provides the Commission with a convenient backdoor way to limit free trade in Japanese cars between individual EU countries. Brussels defends these import controls as a necessary evil, insisting that they were the price for getting governments to agree to open the EU market fully to competition by 1999. But the Commission has also paid a heavy price by colluding in such practices. By doing so, it calls into doubt the sincerity of its commitment to free competition in the car industry and diminishes its authority to enforce single market rules on recalcitrant EU member states.

But her physician  thought that she could probably still drive, so long as she stayed in her own  familiar neighborhood and used her car for such simple activities as grocery  shopping and going to church.    One day, she risked a trip downtown. Lost, confused and disoriented, she  misinterpreted a red light and drove straight into a busy intersection.    Fortunately, she escaped unharmed and did not hurt anybody else. But new  studies have begun to show that people with dementia caused by such illnesses  as Alzheimer's, advanced Parkinson's disease, multiple strokes and even AIDS  are becoming an increasing -- and only recently recognized -- hazard on the  roads.      Major Safety Issue    ""It's a public safety issue of major proportions,"" said Geri Hall, a  gerontology clinical nursing specialist at the University of Iowa Hospitals and  Clinics who is conducting a study on driving and dementia. ""It's as big an  issue as drunk drivers, except it just hasn't had the same publicity.""    About 12% of Americans -- more than 16 million -- are now 65 years old or  older, a figure that is expected to rise to at least 17% within the next 40  years, experts say. Statistics long have shown that as individuals age, they  lose many of the cognitive and physical abilities of their earlier years.  Eyesight, hearing and reflexes often begin to deteriorate.    And, although they typically drive far fewer miles than they did when they were  younger, the accident rate of elderly drivers per miles driven is second only  to that of the very youngest and most inexperienced drivers between 16 and 18.    There is considerable debate over what to do about it. Although many experts  believe that people with dementia should not be allowed to drive, they  recognize that the loss of driving privileges can be devastating.    ""The biggest day in your life is when you get a car and the worst is when they  take it away,"" said Hall, who chairs Iowa's task force on Alzheimer's. ""Nobody  wants to make grandpa stop driving. But these people have the potential for  causing tragedies.""      Judgment Impaired    It is the estimated 2.5 million Americans with progressive dementing illnesses  who pose the greatest danger on the roads because their judgment is often  seriously impaired, experts say.    ""It's like putting a toddler behind the wheel,"" Hall said. ""People who have  normal changes of aging, theoretically, have insight into their condition. If  they're going blind because of cataracts, hopefully they'll stop driving. But  in many cases, Alzheimer's patients are not aware of their deficits. Or if they  are aware, they aren't able to act upon it in a reasonable way.""    ""These people have difficulty interpreting traffic signs,"" said Linda Hunt, an  occupational therapist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis  who is also studying the problem. ""I had one man who saw a green arrow for a  left-hand turn -- all he saw was green and he went straight. A policeman saw  him and stopped him. When he realized there was something wrong with the man,  he escorted him home.""    Hall said that Alzheimer's, as it progresses, produces ""changes in how the  brain perceives what you see and hear. If you have an Alzheimer's patient copy  a stop sign, you often get something totally distorted. It's not that their  eyes aren't working -- it's that the brain is not comprehending things in the  same way it used to.    ""Alzheimer's patients can be driving in a place that is totally familiar and  then something happens in a split second -- a squirrel runs across the road --  and they're lost,"" she added. ""They don't know where they are and they don't  know how to get home.""      Slow Drivers    Dr. Larry E. Tune, director of the dementia research clinic at Johns Hopkins  School of Medicine in Baltimore, said that the number of accident-related  deaths linked to demented drivers is probably less than that caused by drunken  driving because ""the elderly typically drive so slowly."" But the problem is  still serious, he said, and has not been adequately addressed.    ""The frequency rate (of accidents) is frightening, no question about that, and  it's unappreciated, no question about that,"" he said. ""There are probably fewer  fatalities than with drunk drivers, but, proportionately, probably as many  general accidents.""      Dangerous Patterns    Recent research confirms dangerous driving patterns among this patient  population.    Tune recently studied 53 Alzheimer's patients who drove and found that 30% of  them had been involved in at least one accident since their illness began, and  that 11% -- although not directly involved in accidents -- were reported by  their care-givers to have caused them. He said that 44% of them routinely got  lost while driving and that 75% consistently drove below the speed limits.    Another study, released last December and conducted by Dr. Robert P. Friedland,  chief of the section on brain aging and dementia at the federal government's  National Institute on Aging, compared 30 Alzheimer's patients with 20 healthy  people of the same age.      Driving Deteriorates    Friedland and his colleagues found that 47% of the Alzheimer's patients had  been involved in at least one car crash in the previous five years, compared to  only 10% of the healthy persons. Further, 77% of the Alzheimer's patients had  suffered a marked deterioration in their driving performance.    Also, the study showed, 63% of the patients had stopped driving -- although  only 42% of them had stopped driving before they had become involved in an  accident.    ""These data suggest that the occurrence of driving crashes in patients with  dementia of the Alzheimer type is an important public health problem,"" he  wrote.    California requires that a diagnosis of Alzheimer's -- as well as other  disorders characterized by seizures, lapses of consciousness or marked  confusion -- be reported to motor vehicle authorities. A hearing is conducted  to consider whether an individual's license should be revoked. California  transportation and Highway Patrol officials said that the law's impact on  traffic accidents and fatalities has never been studied and thus cannot be  measured.    But some medical specialists fear that the threat of losing a license may keep  patients from seeking treatment, particularly if they are suffering from other  forms of dementia that are treatable or reversible. Also, because Alzheimer's  is often difficult to diagnose, an inaccurate call ""could wrongly deprive a  patient of mobility,"" Tune said.    Hunt wonders whether ""maybe in the early stages (of disease) they should be  allowed to drive on a limited basis, rather than taking their independence  away."" But she added: ""My concern is how this is ever going to be regulated --  I don't know.""    Many experts have urged families to get involved in ways to keep their impaired  relatives from driving. But this approach does not always work.    ""Families often can't get control,"" Hall said. ""We've had some families hide  the keys or the distributor cap, even sell the car. One man nearly broke his  wife's arm trying to get his keys back. She had quite a bit of soft tissue  damage.""    Nevertheless, Tune -- saying that ""there is a gentler way to approach this"" --  believes that, if families and physicians become involved as soon as the  illness is diagnosed, they can prepare for the time when it will be too risky  for the impaired individual to drive. Laws to regulate their driving may not be  necessary, he said.    First, he said, physicians need to be aware of the potential of a driving  problem ""and ask about it."" Then, he said, families need to devise ways of  ""picking up the slack"" to make the transition with a minimum of inconvenience.      Time for Wife to Learn    ""In that generation, it's very common for the man to be the only one who ever  drove,"" he said. ""Maybe the wife needs to go out and learn how to drive. If I  tell her now, when her husband is only mildly impaired, she can go out and  learn. Also, if you're given enough time, you can set up rides, etc., and pare  down the need to drive.""    He added: ""We've got this population that doesn't want to give up its rights  and I don't blame them. Most of the time, they are waiting for something to  happen before they give up driving -- that was the message in Dr. Friedland's  study. Most of the time, it's a trivial accident, but not always. We've had  people die.""    Because most of these diseases are progressive, families can be aware that a  problem is coming and do something about it. ""You can take care of it now in a  smooth way,"" Tune said. ""Or wait until something happens and pay later.""

But her physician  thought that she could probably still drive, so long as she stayed in her own  familiar neighborhood and used her car for such simple activities as grocery  shopping and going to church.    One day, she risked a trip downtown. Lost, confused and disoriented, she  misinterpreted a red light and drove straight into a busy intersection.    Fortunately, she escaped unharmed and did not hurt anybody else. But new  studies have begun to show that people with dementia caused by such illnesses  as Alzheimer's, advanced Parkinson's disease, multiple strokes and even AIDS  are becoming an increasing -- and only recently recognized -- hazard on the  roads.      Major Safety Issue    ""It's a public safety issue of major proportions,"" said Geri Hall, a  gerontology clinical nursing specialist at the University of Iowa Hospitals and  Clinics who is conducting a study on driving and dementia. ""It's as big an  issue as drunk drivers, except it just hasn't had the same publicity.""    About 12% of Americans -- more than 16 million -- are now 65 years old or  older, a figure that is expected to rise to at least 17% within the next 40  years, experts say. Statistics long have shown that as individuals age, they  lose many of the cognitive and physical abilities of their earlier years.  Eyesight, hearing and reflexes often begin to deteriorate.    And, although they typically drive far fewer miles than they did when they were  younger, the accident rate of elderly drivers per miles driven is second only  to that of the very youngest and most inexperienced drivers between 16 and 18.    There is considerable debate over what to do about it. Although many experts  believe that people with dementia should not be allowed to drive, they  recognize that the loss of driving privileges can be devastating.    ""The biggest day in your life is when you get a car and the worst is when they  take it away,"" said Hall, who chairs Iowa's task force on Alzheimer's. ""Nobody  wants to make grandpa stop driving.

0,FT934-1815 ,"FT934-1815 _AN-DLQC8AAIFT 931217   FT  17 DEC 93 / Skoda finds Volkswagen less than reliable: The Czech government is asking the German carmaker to honour its promises      By PATRICK BLUM   Volkswagen's joint venture with Skoda, the Czech car manufacturer, had been hailed as a shining example of east-west co-operation in the post-communist era. Now it has become a source of embarrassment and friction between the Czech government and the German vehicles group. Today, at a meeting in Ingolstadt, near the Czech border with Germany, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech Industry minister, will remind Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, that the Czech government is still the majority shareholder in the venture and should be treated accordingly. He will ask for details of VW's plans for Skoda, where the German group has a 31 per cent stake, which is due to be raised to 70 per cent by the end of 1995, with an option to buy the rest later. The meeting has been called after months of controversy culminating in a fierce public exchange over VW's decision to cut its projected investment in the venture from DM7bn (Pounds 2.75bn) to DM3.7bn and to scrap plans to build a new engine plant. This follows an earlier row over the cancellation by VW in September of a DM1.4bn investment financing package for Skoda only hours before it was to be signed in London. The Czech government, which holds a 69 per cent stake in the venture, says VW failed to inform it in advance about these moves. Prague accepts that VW, which faces big losses this year, may have good reason for scaling down its plans for Skoda, but officials say they must be consulted, and that VW must honour the joint venture agreement signed in 1991, over which there is a dispute about what is legally binding. Prague officials say that the government is meeting its obligations to cover any restitution claims against Skoda and its pre-1991 debts. VW for its part, promised to produce an improved version of the popular Skoda Favorit model, build a new engine plant, and develop a new car. 'We want to see these promises materialised. I don't consider (the engine plant) to be fully out,' says Mr Dlouhy. The difficulty for the government is that many of VW's promises of future investments in Skoda are not part of the original contract, but were made separately to ministers of the previous government. Ironically, VW was chosen in preference to Renault for the venture primarily on the strength of its investment plans, though these will now be considerably less than expected. But what has hurt Czech pride most is that rather than Skoda becoming a major car producer in its own right - fully developing and building its own models - it could turn out to be little more than an assembly plant run from Germany. The government is also concerned that VW's moves to cut back its investment will affect the value of Skoda's shares, making it more difficult to find buyers for the final 30 per cent should VW not take up its option. 'We need to show Skoda is in good shape if we want to get a good price. For that we need a secure investment programme by VW. By cutting their investment by half they undermine the implicit future price of these shares,' says a Prague official. Under growing public pressure and criticism of VW in the Czech press, the government has to show it is fighting for Czech interests. Officials dismiss as unrealistic suggestions that the government should find an alternative investor, but they say the government as majority shareholder could force management changes at Skoda, and decide how the annual dividend is used. Most of all it will press to be kept better informed about VW's intentions. 'After all, unlike in Catalonia (VW's troubled Seat plant), we are still the majority shareholder. We have the right to know (what VW is doing),' says one official. Seat's future, Page 26   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Skoda Automobilova.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

In contrast to the US, where alternative technologies using gas and clean-coal combustion are driving power sector expansions, Russia remains wedded to its nuclear industry. According to a survey by Siemens, nuclear power will apparently account for 18.7 per cent of a greatly increased demand by 2010, compared with 10.9 per cent in 1990. In March, the Russian Ecology Ministry even gave approval for the finish of the 60 per cent complete unit No 5 at Kursk, 500 kms south of Moscow. Kursk No 5 is an RBMK reactor, similar in design to those of Chernobyl. It has, apparently, been thoroughly modernised and enhanced with new safety features. Chernobyl, of course, is in the Ukraine, whose people, along with those of Belarus, suffered most from the disaster. Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, recently revealed that 11m people had been treated in some way for effects of the radiation. Yet the remaining plants on the site are still in operation. The Ukrainian local authorities cannot afford to shut them down, while the station managing director, Nykola Sorokin, believes that they have been sufficiently improved so as to be substantially safer than many other plants in the former Soviet Union. Worries continue about the cracking sarcophagus over the ruined reactor and about the impact of a rising water table underneath. Yet the site remains in production. The Ukraine may indeed lift its ban on building new reactors shortly. The government is under strong pressure to start the nearly complete reactor at Rovno. Even in Belarus, where there are no reactors at all and resistance to building them is extremely strong for obvious reasons, the government has plans to build two, but has yet to find a site. In Armenia, the French nuclear consultancy Framatome is helping assess two 408MW VVER reactors for refurbishment. These were closed after the 1988 earthquake on safety grounds. Now the Armenia government is desperate to reopen them - electricity supplies in the Republic are available for less than one hour a day. Russia's own intended increase in nuclear power does not flow from the same economic motives as those of Armenia or the Ukraine. Russian electricity demand fell in 1992 by 5 per cent. Equally, Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, substantial supplies of oil and more than 400 years of coal supplies at current rates of extraction. In contrast, both Armenia and the Ukraine have had to adjust to rapid increases in fossil fuel prices on which the bulk of their power supply depends. As things stand, 73.3 per cent of Russia's 213GW of power capacity is fossil fuel-fired, 20.3 per cent is hydropower and only 9.5 per cent is nuclear. At present, the nuclear sector has nine plants, with 28 reactors, amounting to 20 GW. Prior to the Chernobyl accident, the Soviet government had planned to more than double this capacity in order to provide the USSR with a20 per cent level of nuclear electricity by 2000 and increasing thereafter. After Chernobyl work was stopped on more than 74 new plants either under construction or planned throughout the USSR. The new plans are not as extensive as this. Ten new reactors are under construction in Russia itself, amounting to 8,600MW as well as 3,000MW in the rest of the C1S area. A further 7,600MW are at the planning stage. Of these, three, at Balakovo, Kursk and Kalinin, are due to be finished by the end of 1995, according to the Ministry of Atom Power (Minatom). A further eight are due to come on line before 2000. In a curious way, the fear about safety in Russian designed reactors has actually aided the role of nuclear power in Russia. As a Friends of the Earth Report, Dangerous Liaisons, pointed out last December, western nuclear companies were among the first industrial sectors to seek work in both eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The process of getting bilateral aid from the west was greatly aided by the fear that Chernobyl could happen again. As the state of former Soviet waste disposal plant was revealed, this too attracted western company interest. In 1991, nearly half of the EC's TACIS technical aid programme for energy in the CIS went on nuclear safety; a figure of Ecu54m. Most of this was spent on 'operational safety' rather than physical upgrading on the RBMKs and virtually all of it went to western companies. Money spent on energy saving measures amounted to Ecu21 million. In 1992, TACIS ceased to have an 'energy' sector at all. It was replaced entirely by nuclear safety with a grant of Ecu100m. Russian enthusiasm for nuclear energy may well be increased by a further Ecu3.3m TACIS grant to the new International Science and Technology Centre (ISTC) in Moscow. Funded with additional money from the US and Canada, Boris Yeltsin has decided to place this under the supervision of Minatom as a home for Russia's numerous unemployed nuclear scientists. In the view of nuclear sceptics, this is using western taxpayers' cash to promote a technology in Russia that is not being developed elsewhere. The anti-nuclear lobby has a dilemma in relation to eastern European and CIS nuclear power. Few can suggest that the safety issue should be ignored. Yet it is clear that expenditure of money on safety at various plant is seen as justification for their continued operation. The original perception was that many of the more dangerous plant would be handed over to western contractors for safety upgrading. Siemens put the price at between Dollars 150-Dollars 180m for a VVER 440MW reactor. Yet Minatom has now stated that it feels fully confident of its own technological skills and wants to limit western involvement to improved monitoring and training, for reasons of national pride as well as money. Yet if the plan is to go ahead with 12 more reactors before 2000 in a Russian nuclear revival, then safety remains a potent question mark over Russian technology. If the Russians have radically improved their record of 'human error', the number of incidents resulting from equipment failure is rising. The preferred solution of anti-nuclear groups, the industry's replacement by gas-fired capacity is perfectly possible and might even be cheaper than a full safety upgrade to western standards. Yet such a shift to gas would worry western gas and power utilities, counting on Russian supplies. Minatom remains at the centre of a power sector which has hardly suffered from the disintegration seen in the oil sector. The nuclear programme will keep it there.

0,FT944-14434 ,"FT944-14434 _AN-EJWA8AEOFT 941022   FT  22 OCT 94 / Books: Dangerous liaisons - Michael Thompson-Noel enjoys other people's affairs      By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL   THE PENGUIN BOOK OF INFIDELITIES edited by Stephen Brook Viking Pounds 17, 376 pages Cecil Parkinson, the Tory politician, will blush - or swell - to hear it, but his fame as an adulterer looks likely to last, judged by his inclusion in Stephen Brook's witty and life-enhancing anthology of infidelities throughout the ages. The scope is broad. As the dust-jacket says: 'The reader will find scenes of tenderness and of sorrow, of bitterness and of rage, of ecstasy and of farce . . . The depravities of ancient Rome are compounded by the exuberant lust of the Earl of Rochester's poems . . . We learn of the exploits of such famous adulterers as James Boswell, Lord Byron and Cecil Parkinson.' Parkinson? You would have thought that interest in his homely little adultery with his homely former secretary, Sara Keays, which caused him to resign from the Thatcher government, had faded by now, given the tide of misbehaviour, in circles high and low, that has swamped us in the meantime. Yet here he is, accorded a spot in an all-time hit parade of bounders, seducers and other sorts of heart-breakers. Infidelity, says Brook, is dangerous, for it confounds the stable order. But it is also exhilarating, at least to those concerned. And it is certainly commonplace. A study of American marriage published seven years ago reckoned that half of all Americans have been adulterous at some time. Another study put the figure at 70 per cent. With some exceptions, most societies take a dim view of adultery, though in most places female lapses tend to be punished more severely than male. Almost all the writers you would hope to see represented in this anthology are represented, from Amis (both) to Boccaccio, Wilde and Wharton, Strindberg and Suetonius. But connoisseurs will notice several obvious omissions. The reason, says Brook, is simply quality of writing. For example, both Henry Miller and Anais Nin are absent because he cannot bear their prose styles. On the other hand, 'classic texts' of infidelity, including Troilus and Cressida, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary and the novels of Colette, are represented by substantial excerpts. There are plenty of jokes: 'You know, of course, that the Tasmanians, who never committed adultery, are now extinct' - Somerset Maugham. And plenty of surprises. I was especially captivated by the notorious Miss Chudleigh, who fascinated the Earl of Bath, nearly married the Duke of Hamilton, went to a ball in a gauze dress and caught the eye of George II, secretly wed the future Earl of Bristol, conquered Frederick II, bigamously married the Duke of Kingston, inherited his fortune, retired to Russia and finished up in France, where she purchased a royal palace for Pounds 50,000. She died in 1788, aged 68, after other love affairs. She was painted in her gauze dress, wearing a ravishing smirk. The dress was a single garment, quite transparent, and probably explained her career. In company like that, Cecil Parkinson and his secretary come across as very dismal potatoes.

Organobromine Chemicals Industry Overview       The organobromine chemical-producing industry in the U.S. is geographically limited by the location of underground bromide-bearing brine deposits. The only major deposits of this type in the United States are located in Michigan and Arkansas. Organobromine chemicals are no longer produced on a large scale in Michigan. EPA identified two firms in southern Arkansas that produce the organobromine chemicals listed in the EDF consent decree. These two firms account for 95% of all organobromine chemical production in the U.S.   The source of all bromine produced currently in the U.S. is the brine deposit in the Smackover Formation in Union, Lafayette, and Columbia Counties, Arkansas. Total demand for bromine has fallen 25% since 1979 and domestic bromine production fell by four thousand metric tons between 1991 and 1992, so there is little incentive for the construction of new bromine extraction plants. In addition, all of the mining rights for bromine-bearing brines in these counties are controlled by two corporations. According to the U.S. Bureau of Mines, these deposits are likely to satisfy domestic demand for sixty years. For these reasons, EPA believes that it is very improbable that any new producers using substantially different technologies will enter the organobromine chemicals industry during the next several decades.   At the time of the first industry study in 1984, ethylene dibromide (EDB) was the most important product of the organobromines industry. EDB was used together with tetraethyl lead in additives designed to increase the octane rating of gasoline. Other industry products included methyl bromide, used as a soil fumigant, and brominated fluorocarbons, which are sold mainly as fire-extinguishing agents.   During the decade that has elapsed since the original industry study, the product mix has changed, due primarily to the advent of several environmental regulatory programs. Vehicles requiring unleaded gasoline were introduced to the U.S. market in 1971, and the phase-out of leaded gasoline is now almost complete. Other nations have instituted similar programs, though on different timetables, which has reduced demand for EDB. The use of methyl bromide as a soil fumigant has been restricted because of the toxicity of this material. Two of the important brominated fluorocarbons, Halon 1211 and Halon 1301, are being phased out of production under the terms of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, to which the United States is a signatory.  The majority of organobromine chemicals manufactured currently are sold as flame retardants. Most of these are solid compounds that are incorporated into polymer mixes. The polymers then are used to manufacture a variety of household and industrial products, including electronic circuit boards, television and computer cases, and packaging and insulating foam. Smaller volume organobromine chemicals are produced by four smaller firms. The principal uses for these products are as reagent chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates. These low volume chemicals are produced on a batch basis with annual production often being a few batches per year.         B.

All other firms in the industry purchase elemental bromine and use it to produce smaller volumes of special-purpose pharmaceutical and chemical intermediates.

Mobile sources.    _(1) Highway vehicle emission factors. The on-highway emission factors for California vehicles are based on CAL15a, which is the March 1993 release of MOBILE5a with modified model year emission control groupings, basic emission rates, and registration age mix based on EMFAC7D.       The EMFAC model could not be used for the FIP for several reasons. Most importantly, an enhanced I/M program is a key part of the FIP proposal, and EMFAC does not allow the examination of I/M programs besides the one currently implemented in California. Similarly, there is no mechanism within EMFAC to address the enhanced in-use compliance program being proposed in the FIP.     There is now an in-house EPA version of MOBILE5a for California based on EMFAC7F, EMFAC7D's replacement, referred to simply as CAL15. More detailed descriptions of CAL15a and CAL15 are provided in the docket. EPA currently plans to use CAL15 in subsequent analyses for the FIP. EPA invites comments on the merits of the various models. Based on these comments and any new data that may become available, EPA may make inventory and control effectiveness adjustments in the final FIP. Such technical adjustments could require or allow changes in the control measures.       Vehicles certified to 49State standards are assumed to comprise 10 percent of the light duty VMT and 20 percent of the heavy duty VMT in the FIP areas. The emission factors for these vehicles were based on MOBILE5a runs using the same inputs as for the CAL15a runs, except the LEV program was excluded, since it would not apply to 49-State vehicles.       It should be noted that the baseline emission calculations include control programs that have already been adopted. This includes the California LEV program, California Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline, and California Clean Diesel Fuel.          "

ACTION:     Final rule.             SUMMARY:     This rule establishes a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 303,     Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles,     that specifies vehicle performance requirements for the fuel system of vehicles fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG). The Standard enhances the fuel system integrity of CNG vehicles by subjecting the vehicles to crash testing and placing a limit on the post-crash pressure drop in the fuel system. The Standard specifies frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests for light vehicles and a moving contoured barrier crash test for school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds. The purpose of this new standard is to reduce deaths and injuries caused by fires resulting from fuel leakage during and after crashes involving vehicles fueled by CNG.      This is the first final rule in the agency's comprehensive effort to regulate alternative fueled vehicles. In addition to this final rule, NHTSA anticipates issuing another final rule that will specify performance requirements addressing the strength, durability, and venting of CNG fuel containers. In addition, as a result of public comments on the CNG notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), the agency anticipates issuing a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) proposing performance requirements that would evaluate a CNG fuel container's internal corrosion, brittle fracture under low temperatures, external damage, and fragmentation.          DATES:     Effective Date:     The Standard becomes effective on September 1, 1995.

Both car output and new-car sales are forecast to achieve further growth next year, with increases of 7 per cent and 6 per cent. Car production in the first 11 months of the year was 1,288,594 - 7.7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of 1992 and in contrast to the steep fall in output in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Car output for export markets has fallen by 6.4 per cent in the first 11 months of this year to 500,817, but this has been compensated for by a 19.1 per cent surge in production for the home market to 787,777. The UK has been virtually the only new-car market in western Europe where demand has been growing significantly this year. New-car sales in Britain in the first 11 months rose by 12.6 per cent in contrast to an overall fall of nearly 15 per cent in the whole of western Europe. According to forecasts by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders UK car production will rise again next year by about 7 per cent to 1.46m from 1.36m this year. Sales of new cars are forecast to rise by about 6 per cent to 1.86m from 1.77m in 1993. Car production in November totalled 128,401 compared with 116,799 a year ago, according to figures released by the society. Output for the home market in November rose by 77 per cent to 76,841, while production for export markets fell by 30 per cent to 51,560. Car output in the month was boosted by rising production from the Rover group, Jaguar and IBC Vehicles and increased production and from the UK plants of Japanese carmakers Toyota and Honda. The improvement has been helped by the UK industry's leading presence in the production of four-wheel-drive leisure/utility vehicles. The leading producers in this sector are Land Rover, part of the Rover group, and IBC Vehicles, a 60/40 joint venture between General Motors and Isuzu which produces the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. Leisure/utility vehicles continued to gain market share, at the expense of sales of conventional passenger cars. The higher level of car output in November was achieved in spite of short-time working by some manufacturers, including Nissan, Vauxhall and Ford. Commercial-vehicle output rose by 14.3 per cent in November to 21,914, the first monthly year-on-year increase since January. In the first 11 months output in this sector was still 22 per cent lower than a year earlier at 182,144.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Sands, M.D.; Denial of Application          On May 14, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Abel J. Sands, M.D. (Respondent) of 316 South Midwest Boulevard, Midwest City, Oklahoma 73110. The Order to Show Cause, which proposed to deny Respondent's application for registration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), alleged that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent issued prescriptions for controlled substances to undercover agents of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (OBN) for other than legitimate medical purposes; that OBN took action against Respondent's state license to handle controlled substances; and that Respondent failed to keep complete and accurate records of this purchasing and dispensing of controlled substances.        Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing and the matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on December 15, 1992. On September 8, 1993, the administrative law judge issued her findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended ruling. On September 30, 1993, Respondent filed exceptions to the recommended ruling of the administrative law judge. On October 12, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record in this proceeding to the Administrator. Having considered the record in its entirety, and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, the Acting Administrator hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below.          It was proven at the hearing that on numerous occasions, Respondent wrote prescriptions to undercover agents in the absence of a legitimate medical purpose. OBN first became aware of Respondent's prescribing practices after Respondent's name arose in the course of an investigation into the street purchase of cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance, Valium and Xanax, both Schedule IV controlled substances. OBN agents posed as patients and visited Respondent's office in an attempt to obtain prescriptions for controlled substances without legitimate medical reason. The OBN agents conducted a total of seven successful undercover operations at Respondent's office between December 1988 and April 1989. On each occasion, the OBN agents were able to obtain prescriptions for Xanax without legitimate medical purpose. All of these undercover operations were taped and transcribed.      On the first undercover visit on December 14, 1988, the undercover agent told Respondent that a friend from whom he had been purchasing Xanax advised him that he could obtain a prescription for Respondent. The agent told Respondent that the Xanax made him ``feel good.'' After initially refusing to provide the prescription, Respondent informed the agent that he would make a patient chart for him, the charge for which would be $25.00. Respondent proceeded to perform a cursory examination of the agent, which included taking his weight and blood pressure. The agent told Respondent that he needed Xanax to ``function'' at work after he used cocaine. Respondent ultimately provided the agent with a prescription for 60 Xanax, stating that writing for 100 would get him (Respondent) in ``trouble.''        OBN agents conducted similar undercover operations on six other occasions and obtained prescriptions for Xanax each time. The lead agent testified, and the transcripts provided corroboration, that he never complained of any medical problem which warranted the use of Xanax. The administrative law judge determined that Respondent did not establish a physician-patient relationship with the OBN agents and concluded that none of the prescriptions at issue was for a legitimate medical purpose.

0," FR940412-1-00072   FR940412-1-00012        Discussion of Proposed Amendments       Subpart 97.12       Subpart 97.12 of 46 CFR part 97 would be revised to clarify that the subpart would apply to bulk solid cargoes in general and not only to ores and ore concentrates. Due to experience gained from a casualty to a foreign vessel that loaded a bulk solid cargo in a U.S. port, the Coast Guard also proposes to extend the applicability of this part to foreign vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters. Further, existing 97.125, which has not been revised since 1965, references a manual that was the predecessor of the BC Code and that is no longer in print. The revised section would include reference to the BC Code as a source of information for use in complying with the requirement that the master of a vessel be furnished with guidance on safe loading and stowage.       Part 148       As discussed, the title of part 148 would be changed to read ``Bulk Solid Materials Requiring Special Handling''.   This NPRM also proposes to modify the structure of the regulations from four to six subparts. Each is explained below briefly.   Subpart A would state the purpose and applicability of the regulations, define terms used in the part, and list (in tabular form) the solid materials permitted to be carried as bulk cargoes.   Subpart B would provide all relevant information concerning Special Permits.   Subpart C would set forth minimum transportation requirements for all materials regulated by 46 CFR part 148 and the requirements for shipping papers and Dangerous Cargo Manifests.   Subpart D would set forth general stowage and segregation requirements for materials according to their hazard class, and, in addition, would contain stowage and segregation requirements for specific materials.   Subpart E would contain special handling, loading, and carriage requirements for specific materials. The requirements for specific materials in subpart D and this subpart would be in addition to the minimum requirements for all materials and the general requirements for their respective hazard classes contained in subpart C.

The proposed regulations would apply to foreign-flag, as well as U.S.-flag, vessels when operating in U.S. waters. The regulations would apply to all classes of vessels that transport solid bulk cargoes which require special handling, including unmanned barges and barge-carrying vessels.       Section 148.3.

Due to experience gained from a casualty to a foreign vessel that loaded a bulk solid cargo in a U.S. port, the Coast Guard also proposes to extend the applicability of this part to foreign vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters. Further, existing 97.125, which has not been revised since 1965, references a manual that was the predecessor of the BC Code and that is no longer in print. The revised section would include reference to the BC Code as a source of information for use in complying with the requirement that the master of a vessel be furnished with guidance on safe loading and stowage.       Part 148       As discussed, the title of part 148 would be changed to read ``Bulk Solid Materials Requiring Special Handling''.   This NPRM also proposes to modify the structure of the regulations from four to six subparts. Each is explained below briefly.   Subpart A would state the purpose and applicability of the regulations, define terms used in the part, and list (in tabular form) the solid materials permitted to be carried as bulk cargoes.   Subpart B would provide all relevant information concerning Special Permits.   Subpart C would set forth minimum transportation requirements for all materials regulated by 46 CFR part 148 and the requirements for shipping papers and Dangerous Cargo Manifests.   Subpart D would set forth general stowage and segregation requirements for materials according to their hazard class, and, in addition, would contain stowage and segregation requirements for specific materials.   Subpart E would contain special handling, loading, and carriage requirements for specific materials. The requirements for specific materials in subpart D and this subpart would be in addition to the minimum requirements for all materials and the general requirements for their respective hazard classes contained in subpart C.   Subpart F would contain requirements for special equipment or procedures when dealing with certain cargoes. The requirements of this part would apply when dealing with a cargo only if a provision from this part is included in Table 148.10 in reference to a particular material included in that cargo.

""If they are sincere about human rights, then they should  stop exploiting Chinese workers,"" he added. ""They"" are the  thousands of foreign entrepreneurs who operate factories in  Fujian to make such goods as running shoes and plastic toys.  Statistics show these businesses -- many of them  medium-to-small Taiwanese companies -- employed more than  400,000 Chinese last year, mostly from other provinces.  Although Fujian is one of the few relatively rich provinces,  labour disputes, particularly those involving foreign  businesses, have surged alarmingly.    In one instance, a female worker in a Taiwanese factory in  Fuzhou was beaten and locked in a cage with two wolfhounds after  she was caught stealing some unused rubber. Fellow workers went  on strike after one of them, who helped the woman escape, was  sacked.    Dangerous work conditions were also common, and some  factories like deathtraps. Last year, 64 textile workers were  burnt to death when fire broke out in a factory at which bosses  had double-locked the doors. Mr Peng described workers in a  Taiwanese factory, mostly young women with little education, who  sat quietly along the production line when he visited. ""They  just put their hands in front of us, some without fingers --  they had been chopped off by machines,"" he said.    Another factory with 400 workers reported 36 industrial  accidents -- some causing permanent injury -- in two years. And  although low wages were often cited as an incentive to invest in  China, some foreigners sought to maximise this advantage. Mr  Peng said he knew of a worker who was paid only 60 yuan (HK$52)  after laboring six months in a factory. Her manager had devised  such exorbitant fees to be paid by workers each month that the  woman was left with barely enough money for her train fare home.    Other factories were run like military camps, said Mr Peng.  Workers had to ask permission to go to toilets and in some  cases, women were not allowed to close toilet doors so they  would not ""stay there too long"". Working hours were ""eternally""  long, Mr Peng said. Sixteen hours a day with overtime pay as low  a 50 fens (half a yuan) an hour had become almost the norm among  joint ventures in Fujian, he said. Mr Peng said such abuses  were limited usually to small and medium-sized factories and  those which had not set up labour unions.    Although Chinese law required all foreign-owned businesses  to  set up such unions, less than a fifth of foreign businesses  operating in Fujian had set up unions by the end of last year,  he said. Labour bureau director Wang Lihong said the Government  was aware of the problems and had already begun provincial  inspections. Section chief Huang Changshun said the inspectors  would examine workers' contracts and police maximum working  hours and the unlawful employment of children in foreign  enterprises. ""We can't sacrifice our workers' interests for the  sake of foreign investment,"" Mr Wang said.     "

Finally, we cap today's column with words of wisdom from  Ed Vanwetswinkle of Costa Mesa, who would like to see a potential solution  imported straight from Deutschland.    Dear Street Smart:    Jamboree Road between East Coast Highway and the San Diego Freeway is a major  artery, yet it seems none of the traffic lights along this stretch are timed or  coordinated.    It is not uncommon to hit a dozen red lights while traveling this relatively  short distance. The posted speed limit is 50 m.p.h., but just getting into  third gear is a major victory.    Most annoying, however, is to move along with the rush-hour traffic and be  forced to stop when a lone car approaches an insignificant intersection (such  as Birch Street, Bison Avenue or one of the several lights at parking lots). It  is neither efficient nor environmentally sound to have 50 cars in either  direction (yes, I've counted) come to a stop, idle, sit and wait, burn gas,  pollute the air and then gear up again just so they can travel the next 100  yards to once again be stopped by a single car coming up to cross an  intersection.    Who is responsible for timing the lights on major surface streets like  Jamboree? Why don't they require a longer waiting period for cars crossing  Jamboree? Why do several office-building parking lots justify having traffic  lights? Are there any plans to time the lights on Jamboree? What can I and  other commuters do to help convince someone that this is necessary?    Tim Pickwell    Newport Beach    Dear Street Smart:    The city of Irvine seems to have adjusted its traffic lights in such a manner  that you get one red light after another when cruising down any given street.    It is my understanding that for years most traffic-light systems were set so  that a vehicle traveling at the posted speed limit would hit green lights. This  has the obvious advantages of allowing traffic to flow and reducing fuel  consumption and exhaust emissions while allowing all those driving to make more  productive use of their time.    Irvine being such a ""planned"" community, it is surprising to find such  anachronistic traffic controls.    Andres Sullivan    Irvine    Let's start with the general and get to the specific.    Most traffic signals in Orange County are computerized, gleaning information  from wire ""loops"" embedded in the pavement that can detect cars passing by.    Unfortunately, such signals can never please all of the people all of the time.  Traffic engineers try for a happy medium between forcing motorists on cross  streets to sit forever and interrupting the flow on a heavily traveled arterial  road. It's never perfect -- even in ultra-planned Irvine -- and can be further  complicated if the equipment breaks down or the programming doesn't quite allow  cars on a major street to get through several lights in sequence.    Jamboree Road is a perfect example. At some times of the day, a motorist can,  believe it or not, travel from the coast to the San Diego Freeway nearly  unimpeded by red lights. But such instances are the exception rather than the  rule.    Eager to improve the situation, the city of Newport Beach has hired a  consultant to come up with ways to improve Jamboree's performance.    ""We want to try for a balance that gives the preference to the heavy traffic  along Jamboree but doesn't become unreasonable for people waiting at the cross  streets,"" said Richard Edmonston, Newport Beach traffic engineer.    But he noted that the majority of gripes about Jamboree Road come from  irritated motorists who have sat for what seemed an eternity at cross streets.    During the morning and evening rush hours, the Jamboree traffic signals are  operated by a computer at Newport Beach City Hall, Edmonston said. While this  computer generally does a reasonably good job of keeping traffic flowing  through green lights, the rolling topography of the roadway can cause a queue  of cars to stretch out, he said. Some stragglers, as a result, may miss a  signal or two.    At other times of the day and night, the signals operate independently. If  there's no one at a cross street, a motorist on Jamboree Road will typically  get a green light. But even a lone car can, as Tim Pickwell points out, make a  line of motorists come grinding to a halt.    Some office buildings along Jamboree Road in Irvine warrant signals chiefly  because of the number of cars they host. The heavy traffic from such buildings  could pose a hazard if it wasn't regulated by a signal, transportation experts  say.    While these transportation experts tinker with the existing system, some Orange  County residents see a need for a more foreign approach. Consider the following  letter:    Dear Street Smart:    In some European countries, specifically West Germany, a traffic system called  Gruenewelle, or ""Green Wave,"" has been used in an effort to reduce traffic  congestion. The purpose of the Green Wave system is to keep traffic flowing at  predetermined speeds on major streets despite the presence of numerous traffic  signals, major intersections and a heavy volume of traffic.    For example, a street like Brookhurst Avenue would display a sign indicating a  ""Green Wave at 45 m.p.h."" All vehicles traveling at 45 m.p.h. on the street  would be able to move through the signal lights without ever stopping for a red  light. Vehicles exceeding or traveling slower than the Green Wave speed would  be caught at red lights.    The benefits would be cutting down on pollution, gas consumption, freeway  traffic, time and aggravation.    Major streets could be targeted as Green Wave streets. People would tend to use  these streets more often, thereby reducing freeway stop-and-go traffic.    The cost would be far less than that of adding new lanes to existing freeways  or building new ones.    Ed Vanwetswinkle    Costa Mesa    The Green Wave may sound a bit like the title of a 1950s monster movie, but it  seems a worthy idea.    A similar approach was used in some U.S. cities in decades past. I can remember  driving with my parents years ago through San Francisco's Sunset District and  seeing signs advising a motorist that the signals were timed to 35 m.p.h. The  system seemed to work pretty efficiently.    Most cities, however, dropped that practice because of legal problems.  Motorists trying to time the signals would sometimes squirt into an  intersection before the red light had turned to green. If such scenarios were  repeated, the Green Wave could truly turn into a horror flick.     Street Smart appears Mondays in the Orange County section of The Times.

Jamboree Road is a perfect example. At some times of the day, a motorist can,  believe it or not, travel from the coast to the San Diego Freeway nearly  unimpeded by red lights. But such instances are the exception rather than the  rule.    Eager to improve the situation, the city of Newport Beach has hired a  consultant to come up with ways to improve Jamboree's performance.    ""We want to try for a balance that gives the preference to the heavy traffic  along Jamboree but doesn't become unreasonable for people waiting at the cross  streets,"" said Richard Edmonston, Newport Beach traffic engineer.    But he noted that the majority of gripes about Jamboree Road come from  irritated motorists who have sat for what seemed an eternity at cross streets.    During the morning and evening rush hours, the Jamboree traffic signals are  operated by a computer at Newport Beach City Hall, Edmonston said. While this  computer generally does a reasonably good job of keeping traffic flowing  through green lights, the rolling topography of the roadway can cause a queue  of cars to stretch out, he said. Some stragglers, as a result, may miss a  signal or two.    At other times of the day and night, the signals operate independently. If  there's no one at a cross street, a motorist on Jamboree Road will typically  get a green light. But even a lone car can, as Tim Pickwell points out, make a  line of motorists come grinding to a halt.    Some office buildings along Jamboree Road in Irvine warrant signals chiefly  because of the number of cars they host. The heavy traffic from such buildings  could pose a hazard if it wasn't regulated by a signal, transportation experts  say.    While these transportation experts tinker with the existing system, some Orange  County residents see a need for a more foreign approach. Consider the following  letter:    Dear Street Smart:    In some European countries, specifically West Germany, a traffic system called  Gruenewelle, or ""Green Wave,"" has been used in an effort to reduce traffic  congestion. The purpose of the Green Wave system is to keep traffic flowing at  predetermined speeds on major streets despite the presence of numerous traffic  signals, major intersections and a heavy volume of traffic.    For example, a street like Brookhurst Avenue would display a sign indicating a  ""Green Wave at 45 m.p.h."" All vehicles traveling at 45 m.p.h. on the street  would be able to move through the signal lights without ever stopping for a red  light. Vehicles exceeding or traveling slower than the Green Wave speed would  be caught at red lights.    The benefits would be cutting down on pollution, gas consumption, freeway  traffic, time and aggravation.    Major streets could be targeted as Green Wave streets. People would tend to use  these streets more often, thereby reducing freeway stop-and-go traffic.    The cost would be far less than that of adding new lanes to existing freeways  or building new ones.    Ed Vanwetswinkle    Costa Mesa    The Green Wave may sound a bit like the title of a 1950s monster movie, but it  seems a worthy idea.    A similar approach was used in some U.S. cities in decades past. I can remember  driving with my parents years ago through San Francisco's Sunset District and  seeing signs advising a motorist that the signals were timed to 35 m.p.h. The  system seemed to work pretty efficiently.    Most cities, however, dropped that practice because of legal problems.  Motorists trying to time the signals would sometimes squirt into an  intersection before the red light had turned to green. If such scenarios were  repeated, the Green Wave could truly turn into a horror flick.     Street Smart appears Mondays in the Orange County section of The Times.

0,FT942-14907 ,"FT942-14907 _AN-EDRDZAERFT 940418   FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (9): Car versus cash - trick or treat?   Under new tax rules nearly 60 per cent of UK executives would be better off swapping their company cars for extra pay and a mileage allowance, according to a survey by Stoy Benefit Consulting. Almost one third would benefit by more than Pounds 750 a year, the company concluded. Stoy Benefit's survey, which was undertaken after the new tax regime was announced last year, looked at 5,400 companies operating a total of 189,000 cars. It claimed to be the largest ever undertaken in the business cars sector and was particularly useful for fleet managers. This was because it based its calculations about employee benefits on the premise that costs to the company of a cash scheme should be the same as if company cars continued to be provided. However, the survey found that the other 43 per cent of executives would benefit from keeping their cars - nearly one quarter of them to the tune of Pounds 700 a year or more. The conclusion, according to Stoy Benefit's managing director, Mr Brian Friedman, had to be that, while the company car was no longer as tax advantageous as it used to be, 'there are still many for whom it remains so'. The government's policy towards taxing company cars 'may, therefore, be said to have been effective in producing the much more balanced position revealed by the survey', he added. However, whether an individual is better off taking cash instead of a car depends very much on personal circumstances and requires analysis of a number of variables. These could include the mix of business mileage to private mileage, the cost of finance, interest foregone and the mileage rate for use of a private car on business. Several tax consultancies and accounting groups, such as Coopers and Lybrand, KPMG Peat Marwick and BDO Binder Hamlyn, have developed complex computer models to make these evaluations. Given the correlation now existing between price and taxation levels, companies should clearly encourage the type of employee reassesment which might encourage staff to hold on to company cars, albeit cheaper ones. This is because the lower the list price, the lower the company's own costs, including the pro rata reduction of the 10.2 per cent National Insurance Contributions the employer is obliged to pay on the employee's private benefit of the car. Another good reason for doing so, suggests remuneration and consultancy and actuarial group Wyatt, is that many companies have little idea of the daunting costs of running a private car. When they make cash offers in compensation for a car they could be storing up industrial relations problems for the future, once employees find out the costs of providing their own cars even with company mileage allowances. Most offers 'fall far short' of actual costs, according to Wyatt's annual study of company cars and flexible benefits packages. Also 'few employees have a clear idea how to calculate the true value of a company car in their personal circumstances', the study, based on a survey of 260 companies operating fleets ranging from a few dozen cars to several thousand, concludes. It found that 69 per cent of organisations surveyed were responding to taxation changes by reviewing their company car policies with 28 per cent of the total offering a cash alternative to the car - more than double the 1992 rate. Popular methods for working out the cash benefit included ensuring that it did not cost the company any more than the car or providing the notional cost of contract hiring a car. However, even in companies offering the cash alternative, the take-up rate was found to be very low - no more than 10 per cent. The Wyatt study concludes: 'Even given a more or less neutral cash alternative offer, in the absence of a positive communication and selling programme, few employees are likely to choose the cash alternative. 'And most employees (85 per cent of those surveyed) still want to retain their company car fleet and, therefore, are not actively seeking to persuade employers to give up their cars.' There are other ways of minimising the tax burden. One, in the short term at least, is for employees to keep their company cars if becomes four years old in the current tax year. As an example, the car might have had a Pounds 10,000 list price in 1990. Under the new list price scheme, it would qualify for a one-third reduction for tax assesment purposes. Simply to replace that car with the same model, at a list price of around Pounds 13,000, would virtually double the tax bill. However, there is more to the car versus cash equation than money itself. Many company car drivers tempted by the cash option are likely to be dissuaded by the 'hassle' factor of running their own cars. For most company car drivers, service or repair is simply a matter of phoning for the car to be picked up and to be delivered back to their home or company. Most private motorists face the dreary business of delivering the car to a garage, finding transport to work, making their own way back to the garage and, possibly, a long wait for a potentially unexpectedly heavy bill. There are no insurance premiums to worry about - no longer a minor issue as a result of increased premiums thanks to soaring crime and accident rates. Considerations like this perhaps help explain the cash take-up is so low currently. The finding is not Wyatt's alone. Monks Partnership, in its own annual survey of companies' car policies, also found fewer than one in 10 drivers taking it up. The small take-up is in spite of a near-doubling in the percentage of surveyed companies making the offer.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8741 Management Services.

Until Renault and PSA industrialize  their concept-cars, small independent automakers will struggle  on alone to build a future for electric vehicles--and assume all  the risks.    Two years ago PSA was trumpeting that France would have  between 10,000 and 50,000 electric vehicles by 1995. Projections  have since fallen to 5,000. The culprit, of course, is the  recession. But cold feet on the part of big manufacturers and  the cautious attitude of collectivities--the only players  capable of ""getting the market off the ground""--are also  responsible. With no Draconian law in effect to curtail urban  pollution1, cities saw electric cars mainly as an  inexpensive way to fashion a ""glamorous"" image for themselves.  Virtuous in the extreme, non-polluting, quiet, robust, and  easy-to-drive and park electric cars are nonetheless guilty of  one sin: they are expensive. The (1995) electrified version of  the Clio, for instance, will cost 170,000 French francs [Fr], or  three times as much as the standard one! The limited autonomy of  electric vehicles and, most important, the lack of urban  infrastructure (recharge terminals) also work against them. In  fact, electric cars are the victims of a classic vicious circle:  Limited infrastructure plus high prices equals few users and  small production runs, thus keeping prices high and the number  of customers low. This raises the question of who will take the  risk of jumping in first. Initially, big automakers seemed the  answer. So far, neither PSA nor Renault has done anything more  than electrify very-small-run commercial vehicles. Renault will  not start series production of the Master until March, or of the  Express until October, 1994, following eight years of  experimentation and 400,000 km of road tests at its  Chatellerault pilot site. Moreover, annual production volumes  will not exceed 1,000--a drop in the bucket! True, Renault's  Clio and PSA's 106 and AX will come out in electrified versions  by 1995. But here again, the doses will be homeopathic.  Automakers are offering electrified ""commercial"" vehicles first,  both to supply companies and collectivities and for technical  reasons. Battery weight in relation to total weight is less of a  drawback on commercial vehicles than it is on personal  automobiles. In addition, the industrial investment needed to  electrify vehicles is virtually negligeable. Laurent Bernard,  project head of Renault's Electric Commercial Vehicles Division,  confirms this. ""Whether or not the vehicle is electric makes no  difference in the process. Clio's engine plant is replaced by  its electrical equivalent. The only change is the addition of an  assembly island to install the battery block."" Launching series  production of the first personal cars truly designed to be  powered electrically would be striking evidence of the  commitment of big automakers. Unfortunately, Renault's Zoom,  Citroen's Citela, and Fiat's Downtown are still nothing more  than elegant theoretical constructs, with no launch dates in  sight. The same manufacturers have not yet definitively chosen  between all-electric vehicles and hybrid ones, as evidenced by  Volkswagen's Chico, BMW's E1, or Renault-Volvo's ECC. Most  important, the pricing policy of big automakers is a huge  discentive. ""It's because we haven't got costs under control.  Seventy percent of the value of a traditional car is  subcontracted, against 90 percent for an electric car!"" pleads  Laurent Bernard of Renault.    What might look like a wait-and-see attitude actually  reflects real difficulties in keeping in step with a market  whose volume is too low. As Dominique Mathon, director of  Microcar (Jeanneau), explains, ""Starting at 5,000 cars a year,  we would have to revamp our manufacturing process. In contrast,  5,000 is the break point at which big manufacturers can consider  launching a series!"" So it is the ""Tom Thumbs"" of the industry  that hold the future of the electric car in their hands, and  will continue to do so for another several years. Most of these  pioneers began as makers of small motorized vehicles that do not  require driver's licenses and of commercial vehicles. Examples  include Erad, Aixam, Microcar, and Automobiles Ligier. In  producing electric cars, they are remaining faithful to their  light, two-seater, urban vehicle niche. The automakers have  banded together under the banner of Apvere. As Pierre Bazier of  Rocaboy indicates, it is an objective alliance in which ""Each  supplier offers a line that complements the others'."" Adds  Bazier, ""Each time one of us sells an electric car, he helps  shore up the market.""    Jack Vergne, director of Seer-Volta, sees no reason to be  anything but optimistic. ""Our production doubles every year: 75  vehicles in 1991-92, 150 in 1992-93. Our goal for 1994 is 300.""  The company has resolutely opted to produce just one product: a  small commercial vehicle comparable to Citroen's C15 and  Renault's Express for roughly the same price. How will the  company be able to justify making its electric vehicle when the  two groups launch their own series? Jack Vergne is untroubled.  ""Unlike those `electrified' models, Volta was designed to be  powered by an electrical engine. This shows in its performance.  Volta has a payload of 500 kg, against 300 kg for the C15; its  degree of lock is shorter; the car's batteries do not cut into  the amount of space available in the interior; and its  suspension has been adapted to handle the extra weight.""  Competition from the big names does not scare Pierre Bazier of  Rocaboy either. ""Our model can be transformed in any way we need  to."" Erad agrees, pointing out that ""We are satisfying demands  that the big car companies will never be able to meet. One  example is a modified version with a very short degree of lock  to enable it to maneuver easily in the tunnel under the  Channel!"" Technologically, the companies must take a pragmatic  approach, and the small firm Seer-Volta makes do with what it  can find on the market. That means lead batteries and d.c.  motors. ""Nickel-cadmium technology would push up the price of  batteries from Fr17,000 to Fr70,000. If that happened, we would  offer lease contracts to enable customers to stagger their  payments.""    Most of the small car makers hold down their manufacturing  costs by using non-industrialized technologies. Seer-Volta, for  instance, buys its tubular frames from the supplier of Renault's  Alpine. And it molds its body in polyester resin, a simple and  cheap process that makes the vehicle quite light. Won't these  modest processes curb production if the market takes off? ""Not  at all. We can supply up to 1,000 vehicles a year without  changing anything in our procedure,"" says Jack Vergne. Another  shrewd move on the part of the automaker is avoiding the long  and costly crash-test process. ""Volta features an `advanced  cabin'; a simple Utac inspection is enough."" Of all the  automakers, Erad boasts the most varied line: three leisure  vehicles (Agora, Spacia, Junior) and two commercial ones. Two  years ago, electric vehicles accounted for two percent of its  sales; today they make up 30 percent! Pascal Ansart, marketing  director of Erad, describes the typical Homo Electricus Rex:  ""He's a veterinarian! He uses the car for his work, in urban  areas and over short distances. Since he travels alone, he  appreciates a `two-seater' that is easy to park and less  expensive than a thermal vehicle: Fr1,400 altogether against  Fr1,700 a month for a diesel."" At Fr51,000, Erad's Agora is  certainly the cheapest vehicle on the market. ""It's because we  make everything in house, using hyper-light materials. Agora  weighs only 650 kg, including batteries. The vehicle's cost is  tied directly to its weight/power ratio."" Although the Junior is  ""electrified"", the models that followed it were literally  designed around batteries. ""The load is perfectly distributed,  which gives the vehicle excellent steering. That is not true of  electrified vehicles.""    Rocaboy, for its part, is a pioneer, having homologated its  first electric vehicle in 1977! The RK200 commercial vehicle is  now its leading product. Pierre Bazier, Rocaboy's director,  explains. ""Electric vehicles are expensive, I agree; but in  certain cases, a thermal model would be even more so! For  instance, if thermals were required to run quietly or without  spewing any emissions into the air. So we supply Atomic Energy  Commission plants and the Louvre Museum with vehicles for their  service areas. Electric vehicles are perfectly suited for  industrial use involving stops and starts every 500 meters and  close handling."" Finally, there are the companies that design  special-use vehicles: Sita and Semat for street cleaners and  garbage trucks, and Charlatte for industrial vehicles. Says  Sita's Alfred Trombini, ""Our electric models derive from thermal  ones; they are quiet and non-polluting, two requirements which  are found in certain municipal bid invitations. Given the price  of this type of vehicle, the additional cost of electrification  is only 10 to 30 percent."" Such a small ratio makes it possible  to retain a thermal engine to enable the vehicle to get back to  repair shops and incineration plants, which are located far from  urban areas.    Small electric carmakers still have a few years before the  ""big guys"" invade their turf. At that time they might taste the  bitter experience of having been the first ones on the block.  Then again, they could, in the meantime, widen the gap so far  that they will become forces to be reckoned with.    Boxed Material: Electric Vs. Electrified Vehicles    ""Electrified"" vehicles are avatars of thermal ones--that is,  they are series models whose original powerplants have been  replaced by electric motors. All large-run personal vehicles  will continue to be electrified versions for the next several  years. Electric vehicles, in contrast, are designed with  electrical propulsion in mind. Generally they feature two or  three seats. Since battery weight and space needs are factored  in from the outset, electric vehicles offer better skid  resistance, comfort, and ergonomics. Their batteries, whose  placement is better planned, do not cut into the room available  in the vehicle's interior.    In a Nutshell    --Once they reach a volume of 5,000 a year, small  manufacturers will have to revamp their production processes.  That is still a ways down the road.    --A vehicle designed to be powered electrically can carry 40  percent more payload than a classic electrified vehicle.    --Agora weighs only 650 kg, including batteries.    Photo Captions    Sita has been making its Lama 6000 street cleaner since  1990.  The same company supplies electric garbage trucks to the cities  of Bordeaux and Paris. It was awarded the EUREKA label for one  of its research programs on electric vehicles.    Renault's Master and Express are electrified vehicles.  Tested  since 1986 in Chatellerault, they will be mass-produced in 1994.  The city of Goteborg (Sweden) has ordered 200.    Erad's Agora, made since early 1993, is the least expensive  electric car on the market at Fr51,000. It is a small,  two-seater, convertible with almost 2 HP! Its maker Erad is in  the process of industrializing its shops to meet demand. The  company expects to sell 450 electric cars (half personal, half  commercial) in 1994.    The BMW E1 is an example of a hybrid vehicle equipped with a  combustion and an electric engine. It has the qualities of a  road car and is expected to reach maximum speeds of 125 km/h on  its electric engine.    Peugeot's electric 106 and its AX cousin--also  electric--will  be given to 50 individual drivers for a year and a half in La  Rochelle. This user test will precede product launch. It will  also give the city a chance to test the smart-card-operated  recharge terminals, slow recharge in parking lots, and quick  recharge in certain gas stations.    Renault's Zoom concept-car, devised by Matra Automobile,  prefigures the urban electric car of the next millenium. Its  rear suspension is mounted on a retractable chassis, which  shortens it 60 cm and allows it to be parked perpendicular to  the sidewalk. The Zoom's nickel-cadmium batteries are expected  to give it automony of 150 km. In 1995, Renault should  industrialize its first electric recreational vehicle, the Clio.    Opel's Twin is a four-seater vehicle, with one seat in the  front and three in the back. A 10-kW three-phase engine equips  each wheel hub. The Twin can reach speeds of 120 km/h.  Carbon-lithium batteries give it autonomy of 250 km.  Footnotes    1. In California, the law requires that two percent of all  vehicles be emission-free (and thus electric) by 1998, and that  10 percent meet that standard by 2003. In France, a 25 October  1991 decree defines special protection areas where prefects can  take any measure needed to bring atmospheric pollution levels  below an admissible threshold.     "

On July 14, 1993, the FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 393.95 to allow commercial motor vehicles to be equipped with fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles, except CMVs transporting explosives (Division 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 hazardous materials), cargo tank motor vehicles used for flammable and combustible liquids (Class 3 hazardous materials) or flammable gas (Division 2.1 hazardous materials) (whether loaded or empty), or motor vehicles using compressed gas as a motor fuel. The FHWA also proposed amending 392.22(b), which sets forth requirements for the placement and use of warning devices for stopped vehicles, because paragraph (b) did not allow the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles.

Problems had existed between VW and Skoda over VW's accounting for 1993 which showed Skoda had made a net loss of DM246m (Dollars 144m) after a DM233m profit in 1992. The loss resulted almost exclusively from adjustments to Skoda's accounts to bring them into line with international standards which include more depreciation and write-downs. Without the adjustments, Skoda would have made an DM8m profit in 1993 after a DM70m profit a year earlier, VW said.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Skoda Automobilova.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a letter to the company that an agency study showed there was a 2.4 times greater risk of fire occurring in fatal side-impact crashes involving the GM vehicle than in similar sized Ford pick-up trucks. Consumer groups that have advocated a recall have said the safety problem affects 4.7m 1973-1987 model trucks. GM said it disagreed with the agency's request and would try to demonstrate to it that a recall of trucks was unwarranted.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.

White-collar unions at Ford are due to meet the management next Tuesday following a ballot vote in support of industrial action. A union official said yesterday that his members were 'champing at the bit' to strike over the compulsory redundancy issue. Last week Ford agreed not to press ahead with compulsory redundancies among its blue-collar workers thanks to improved demand and adjustments to production targets.

As explained in the November 17, 1986 (51 FR 41574)     Federal Register     notice, EPA listed a substance as an extremely hazardous substance if oral studies showed an LD    50     of less than or equal to 25 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight. The petitioner brought to the Agency's attention that the study was actually on sodium tellurate (CAS     #    10102202; already listed as an EHS) and not on tellurium metal. The petitioner also provided a study (Prinsen (1991)) which showed an LD    50     for tellurium metal in excess of 5000 mg/kg. Based upon this information, the Agency is proposing to remove tellurium from the EHS listing while maintaining the listing for sodium tellurate.   The Agency requests comments on whether it should proceed to delist these four chemicals based upon this information or any additional information submitted by commenters relating to whether these chemicals meet the section 302 listing criteria.   HULs America, Inc. submitted a petition to delist isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). EPA is denying the petition to delist because IPDI meets the criteria for listing, as discussed in the next Unit on Petition Denials. However, in considering this petition, EPA noted that the threshold planning quantity had been determined based on IPDI's being a reactive solid at standard temperatures, when in fact it is a liquid and not highly reactive. Accordingly, EPA is proposing to change the threshold planning quantity for IPDI based on the methodology for determining threshold planning quantities for liquids instead of the methodology for reactive solids.   EPA's methodology for establishing threshold planning quantities for liquids, once it is determined that the substance meets the listing criteria, consists of initially determining the maximum short term exposure concentration in air that would not lead to serious irreversible health effects in the general population when exposed to the substance for relatively short duration. This is the so-called ``level of concern.'' (See the Threshold Planning Quantities Technical Support Document, April 7, 1987.)   There are two ways to determine a ``level of concern.'' If it is available for a chemical, EPA may use the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) level established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This is the maximum concentration of a substance in air to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes and escape without suffering irreversible health effects or impairing symptoms.   If the IDLH value is not available, as is the case for most of the EHSs, the EPA uses an IDLH equivalent value using available toxicity data with an adjustment factor to estimate the IDLH value. For the initial TPQ for IPDI the LC    50     of 0.12 mg/l over a 4 hour exposure period was multiplied by 0.1 to estimate the IDLH value.   The level of concern is then divided by a factor ``V'' which represents the extent to which the material can volatilize and become airborne and dispersed. This is explained in the November 17, 1986     Federal Register     notice at 51 FR 41577. For liquids this involves knowing the molecular weight and vapor pressure. The derivation of the factor ``V'' for liquids is explained in Appendix 1 of the November 17, 1986     Federal Register     notice for the interim final rule (51 FR 41580).   The final threshold planning quantity is then determined from a set of index values. The index values and their corresponding threshold planning quantities are found in the threshold planning quantity technical support document. Applying this methodology to IPDI gives it a threshold planning quantity of 1000 pounds. The calculations for this determination are found in the administrative record for this petition. EPA is, thus, proposing to raise the threshold planning quantity for IPDI from 100 to 1000 pounds.       III.

On Wednesday, car carriers were loading inventory from Grand Chevrolet Inc. to  transport the vehicles to an auction. Bankruptcy officials said the cars were  being repossessed for liquidation by General Motors Acceptance Corp., the car  maker's financing company.    The Department of Motor Vehicles failed last year in a bid to revoke the sales  licenses of both Grand Chevrolet and Grand Motors Inc., members of a related  chain of auto brokerages.      Owner Has Vanished    Eminiano (Jun) Reodica, who owned the companies, vanished as his business  empire collapsed. He is believed to have fled to the Philippines.    Department of Motor Vehicles investigators alleged that Reodica's companies had  inflated sales figures, duped customers into signing documents that added extra  charges, and processed loans through more than one lender.    According to police, Reodica's sales force included members of a Filipino gang  who occasionally strong-armed employees into cooperating with the fraudulent  sales practices.

On Wednesday, car carriers were loading inventory from Grand Chevrolet Inc. to  transport the vehicles to an auction. Bankruptcy officials said the cars were  being repossessed for liquidation by General Motors Acceptance Corp., the car  maker's financing company.    The Department of Motor Vehicles failed last year in a bid to revoke the sales  licenses of both Grand Chevrolet and Grand Motors Inc., members of a related  chain of auto brokerages.      Owner Has Vanished    Eminiano (Jun) Reodica, who owned the companies, vanished as his business  empire collapsed. He is believed to have fled to the Philippines.    Department of Motor Vehicles investigators alleged that Reodica's companies had  inflated sales figures, duped customers into signing documents that added extra  charges, and processed loans through more than one lender.    According to police, Reodica's sales force included members of a Filipino gang  who occasionally strong-armed employees into cooperating with the fraudulent  sales practices.

Up to 12,000 a year will be supplied to FHI from next year under an original equipment manufacture deal. The versions of the Suzuki Cultus, currently produced in two-wheel-drive form, will replace a Subaru Justy model which FHI had previously shipped from Japan.

Huggins was speaking at a news conference in the Parliament  Committee Room yesterday just prior to yesterday's sitting of  the Senate. The media conference was called to answer  journalists' queries arising from the Bill to amend the  Dangerous Drugs Act.    Huggins said the proposed amendments would allow Trinidad  and  Tobago to ratify the Vienna Convention. This, he added, would  give this country greater access to funding for the fight  against the drug trade from donor countries such as the United  States, the Netherlands, Germany and France.    He said the passage of this legislation signals to the  international community that ""we are serious.""    Huggins said one of the more important features of the Bill  was its provisions relating to money-laundering, which, he said,  could destroy the financial system of a country.    ""One has to understand dealings in drugs take place in cash.  So you have a lot of cash to clean. Cash can be cleaned by  buying a boat from someone for $90,000. You pay in cash and then  you sell it back for $80,000. You are prepared to take the  $10,000 loss because you now have $80,000 certified (clean)  money.""    He cited the U.S. as an example of a case where there has  been a proliferation of jewelry stores and ""when you go down  inside them they don't have a piece of jewelry; they are simply  being used as fronts.""    He said that in Trinidad and Tobago drug lords had used the  importation of potatoes as a laundering device.    He said laundering could occur in any establishment: ""Where  you had the import of used cars, that is another method of doing  it.    You bring down cars and you pay more for them and sell them  for less. That is one of the ways in which it is done. Another  way is to buy up postal orders every month.""    Huggins said one of the biggest busts in the U.S., ""US $6  billion in cash,"" had been organised in this way. ""A massive  laundering operation which took four years to bust and with all  the resources they have.    I mention this simply to let you know that you shouldn't  look for miracles from our people. We are trying to put a unit  together and are having some hiccups with the Organised Crime  and Narcotics Unit.""    But he stressed that there were dedicated people working on  it, adding that it took time to really bust a drug operation.  ""Time and a lot of ground work. A drug lord does not bring you  into his trust overnight,"" he said.    ""He said between November 1993 and this year, the Trinidad  and Tobago authorities had participated in the seizure of 200  kilos of cocaine shipped from Trinidad. The intelligence given  for its seizure came from here,"" he said.    Stressing that in order to hurt the drug-trafficker one had  to deal with money-laundering, Huggins pointed to some of the  shortcomings of the original legislation, which, he said, did  not go far enough.    Before now, he said, it was not an offence for a  drug-trafficker to launder his own proceeds, though it was an  offence for someone to help him.    Huggins said the proposed legislation, apart from addressing  this, would also limit the number of places where the  drug-trafficker could hide his assets because the Bill allowed  for the recognition and enforcement.    The Bill was passed unanimously at 9:45 p.m.     "

This compares with a previous forecast of Y1bn pre-tax profits and would mean the third consecutive year of losses for the company. Fuji Heavy said the main reasons for its revised forecast were the continuing weakness of demand for automobiles, the yen's appreciation and Y1bn of stock appraisal losses. Sales for the year are expected to be Y870bn, instead of Y900bn, and after-tax losses Y8.5bn instead of Y1bn.

0,FT931-7061 ,"FT931-7061 _AN-DBZCKACPFT 930226   FT  26 FEB 93 / Management: Driving force - Audi's new chairman has inherited ambitious plans for the German car group      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES   A wooden oar looks more than a little incongruous leaning against the wall in the glass, chrome and leather office of Audi's new chairman. But Franz-Josef Kortum, 42, sets great store by the welcoming gift presented to him by Ferdinand Piech, who moved out in January to take the wheel at Volkswagen, Audi's lacklustre parent. It is a symbolic reminder of the responsibilities of a steersman, says Kortum. But it also has what amounts to an explicit directive burnt into the blade: 'Audi, the most attractive European in the world market.' Piech's parting homily lacks the appeal of the brand's world-renowned 'Vorsprung durch Technik' slogan, but then the author is an engineer, not a copywriter. Kortum, by contrast, is a salesman, hardened on the forecourts of the family motor business, tempted away from Mercedes-Benz last May to take charge of Audi's new marketing division and promptly bumped up to the top job in Volkswagen's showpiece subsidiary. His arrival from relative obscurity outside the closed circuit of Volkswagen management, his youth and his business background provide ample fuel for speculation on Piech's mould-breaking intentions within VW's hide-bound central bureaucracy in Wolfsburg. Despite the apparent risks of appointing a young unknown, the clues Piech left behind at Audi show the new group chairman is no gambler. He prepared the ground meticulously before handing over. Plans to extend the model range  -with a new flagship V8 car at the top and a cheaper model to slot in below the popular Audi 80 at the bottom - were already well advanced at the time of his departure. A dedicated marketing division, separate from that of VW, was established a year ago. Since then Piech has replaced most of the old hands at the Audi helm. Most recently, he poached a production director, 48-year-old Jurgen Gebhardt, from his job as manager of General Motors' brand-new, low-cost Opel works in Eisenach, eastern Germany. Erich Schmitt, 46, was brought in from Vauxhall, another GM subsidiary, to fill a new board seat devoted to purchasing, finance and organisation. Sitting in Ingoldstadt, Bavaria, Kortum contemplates his inheritance. Behind Mercedes-Benz and BMW, he states, the Audi marque is recognised as the third German player in the quality car market. There is less than one percentage point between the market shares of the three inside Germany, where Mercedes had 6.5 per cent last year. Customers are relatively well-off. Most Audi buyers in Britain and the US are well-educated, senior, white-collar workers or managers. A typical German customer, who may not have spent so much time at college, takes home double the national average pay. Even so, the vast bulk of sales in Germany are still accounted for by the more modest models bearing the Audi 80 badge. 'What we need now is to stabilise our position in the top rank. Perhaps I can explain in a picture . . . Here we are in our Audi house.' Villa Audi has two sound middle storeys, represented in Kortum's 'picture' by the popular Audi 80 and the upmarket 100 model. But it has a flat roof and no ground floor. It needs a fine, status-symbol roof to reflect the charisma of the whole structure. This is the role of the incoming V8, due out next spring. The front garden, he adds, is represented by the distributors. Although many Audis will continue to be sold with other group brands, selected dealerships in key urban centres - a matter for negotiation with Wolfsburg - will be dedicated as prestige showplaces for Audi. The purchase of the British sales network from Lonrho and the takeover of 17 JAX distributorships in the Tokyo area, mark the beginning of this process. Meanwhile, the house needs more structural work. Kortum is preoccupied by the fact that Villa Audi still lacks a ground floor and, by implication, an easily accessible front door. Customer profiles show the average Audi purchaser in Germany is aged 49, in Britain 45 and somewhere between the two in the US. Although Kortum claims there is a downward trend at the lower margin of the age profile, he admits there are still too few young people on dealers' registers. Enter the Audi 50 - a car pitched close to the market position now occupied by the evergreen VW Golf. Kortum sounds less than certain when he promises its arrival for sometime in the second half of the decade. However, he considers it essential for his strategy of drawing in new buyers early and keeping them moving upstairs in the Audi house rather than down the road to Mercedes. He recognises the strengthening tendency for car buyers to switch brands more readily. New competition is emerging from all sides - not least from Mercedes, which also plans to introduce a cheaper entry-level model to its heavyweight range. Demand is also undergoing subtle changes influenced by a reluctance among the well-off to flaunt their possessions. Environmental awareness is generating new trends in taste and behaviour. Despite the present structural deficiencies, Kortum considers Audi well-armed to cope. The marque's carefully nurtured reputation as a high-tech maker will be protected. The 'Vorsprung durch Technik' selling line will remain, however, future promotions will be 'a bit more emotional', extending the appeal to people looking for a 'sympathetic' brand. These qualities, he promises, will become wholly apparent with the launch of the flagship V8. 'It will be elegant and overall an environmentally-compatible compromise in terms of weight, fuel consumption and recyclability,' Kortum claims. That may be so, but Kortum, who is faced with having to cut Audi's total output by up to 15 per cent this year and does not foresee an upturn in the depressed motor market until 1995-96, cannot hope for more than modest early sales. While the recession runs its course, his oar will act as a reminder of why he was brought in. His job is to ensure the brand's new age aura is radiating at full wattage when Villa Audi is complete.

Skoda said it would visit Volkswagen headquarters in Germany within the next few days to finalise the package. A public announcement was expected soon after the completion of the plan. VW said in September it would restructure its financial package for Skoda, after abruptly cancelling an Dollars 870m loan. Volkswagen took a 31 per cent share in Skoda when the Czech carmaker was privatised in 1991.

0,FT942-11120 ,"FT942-11120 _AN-EEFEDAHFFT 940506   FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (14): Inter-City and coast to coast - A basic guide to the system and how it works      By MAURICE SAMUELSON   The Eurotunnel system consists of three parallel tunnels: two single-track tunnels and a smaller service tunnel. They run for 38km under the Channel. The rail tunnels will be used by Eurotunnel shuttle trains carrying road vehicles, and by through-trains operated by the British, French and Belgian national railways. The service tunnel, which is linked to the rail tunnels by cross passages every 375 metres, will be used for maintenance and also for evacuation in case of emergency. There are two undersea crossover caverns where the rail tunnels are brought together, making it possible for trains to cross from one track to the other. The crossovers divide the length of the rail tunnels into three equal sections, any of which can be closed off in an emergency or for maintenance. The two rail tunnels were excavated 30 metres apart and no closer than 8 metres to the walls of the service tunnel. When it opens for business later this year: Eurotunnel will operate a rail shuttle service for passenger and road-freight vehicles on a rail loop between terminals at Folkestone and Calais; the national rail companies of Britain, France and Belgium - BR, SNCF and SNCB - will operate through-train services. High speed passenger services, using specially built Eurostar rolling stock, will link London with Paris, Brussels and beyond. Rail freight services will also serve UK regional centres. In both Britain and France, vehicles will turn off the motorway directly on to the terminal approach roads. After passing the toll booths, frontier controls and security checks, they will be directed to an allocation area before boarding the shuttles. Vehicles will pass through both French and British frontier controls before departure and there will be no further checks on arrival. Amenity buildings at both terminals will offer a range of services to travellers. Most drivers and passengeers will remain with their vehicles during the shuttle journey, which will take about 35 minutes. The total transit time from motorway to motorway is expected to be just over an hour. Motorcyclists will also travel in passenger vehicle shuttles, but will park their machines in a special section of the shuttle and travel in separate passenger compartments. Cars and other vehicles less than 1.85m high will travel in double-deck carriages. Coaches and vehicles more than 1.85m high will travel in single-deck carriages. Eurotunnel describes the passenger vehicle shuttles as well-lit airconditioned and sound-proofed. During the journey each carriage will be divided off from the next by sliding fire shutters. Passenger access doors will allow free movement on either side of these fire barriers and there are toilet facilities in every third wagon. Cars will board the shuttle through wide access doors in a loading wagon at the rear of each section, moving forward through the carriages until instructed to stop. On arrival cars will leave the shuttle through an unloading wagon at the front of each section. The service will operate day and night throughout the year. Tickets may be bought at the toll or in advance, but will not involve a reservation for a specific shuttle departure. When a vehicle arrives at the terminal it will be put on the first available shuttle. In the early years, passenger vehicle shuttles will run at about 15 minute intervals during peak periods and 20 minute intervals during the day. The minimum service, at night, will be one passenger vehicle shuttle per hour. Freight vehicles will be separated from cars before the toll booths and follow different routes through the frontier controls and security. The shuttle wagons for freight vehicles are not air conditioned or sound proofed. Lorry drivers will travel in a special coach, the Club car, at the front of the shuttle, where refreshments are served. Initially freight shuttles are to run up to three times an hour; the overall motorway to motorway transit time is expected to be about 80 minutes. In addition to the rolling motorway shuttle serivce, half the tunnel capacity has been leased to national railway companies who will operate conventional freight and passenger through services. Passenger through trains will link London Waterloo with Paris Gare du Nord and Brussels Midi. Intermediate stations are at Lille and Frethun near Calais and a third is planned at Ashford in Kent. Later there will be day and night 'sleeper' services running beyond the three capitals.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     FRZ  France, EC.

0,FT932-686 ,"FT932-686 _AN-DF0AKAEUFT 930626   FT  26 JUN 93 / Motoring: Ford puts on the style for estates      By STUART MARSHALL   GOOD-LOOKING estate cars have joined Ford's Mondeo range. The subtly-curved rear end makes the estate's styling far less anonymous than that of the saloons and hatchbacks. The re-designed independent rear suspension is exclusive to the estate car. It minimises intrusion so successfully that Ford claims the Mondeo has a class-leading load space volume (58.3 cubic feet) and a load floor length (73.5 in/184 cm) which is virtually the same as a Volvo 940. All estates cost Pounds 1,000 more than their saloon or hatchback equivalents. Prices range from Pounds 12,835 for a 1.6-litre LX to Pounds 14,155 for the 1.8-litre GLX and Pounds 18,450 for a 2.0-litre Ghia. This flagship model comes with ABS brakes, alloy wheels, self-levelling rear suspension and air-conditioning as standard. Most of these features can be had as extra-cost options on other Mondeo estates. A traction control system is available only on the two-litre models, but every Mondeo Estate has a driver's side air bag and power steering. At present, buyers get a pleasant five-speed manual gearbox without the option, but on their way are automatics and four-wheel drives (although these will have manual transmission only). Before that come 1.8-litre turbo-diesels, which should perform at least as well as Mondeo estates with 1.6-litre petrol engines. Even the cheapest 1.6-litre LX has 60:40 split folding rear seats, a load space cover, and tie-downs to stop heavy things sliding forward should you have to make a panic stop. YOU ARE driving along a motorway in pouring rain when, suddenly, the steering becomes suspiciously light. Turning the wheel produces no response. Your front tyres are aquaplaning. Instead of biting on the tarmac, they are riding on a film of water that the grooves and slots of the tread pattern cannot clear away fast enough. Aquaplaning is alarming and potentially lethal. Mostly, it happens when you hit a long puddle or a sheet of water streaming sideways across a road. But continuous aquaplaning conditions can occur for hundreds of yards on level but poorly-drained road surfaces in a deluge. The faster you go, the greater the risk. Many unexplained wet-weather accidents of 'the car just went into a skid' variety are because of aquaplaning, especially if the tyres have wide treads and are well worn. The best way to avoid aquaplaning is, of course, to slow down when it rains cats and dogs. But risks can be lessened by choosing a tyre like Goodyear's new Aquatred, which has just gone on sale in European markets, including Britain. At a glance, the deep drainage channel in the middle of the tread makes the Aquatred looks like two very narrow tyres side by side. This channel lets a lot of water flow through the tyre's footprint, with the surplus pumped out to the side through slots. These are so curved that the Aquatred is a one-way tyre; a big arrow on the side wall shows the direction of rotation. The 'twin tyre' principle has been used before on tyres for vehicles with very high performance, but the Aquatred is the first aimed at cars like Golfs and Mondeos, Peugeot 405s and Rover 400s. It costs about 7 per cent more than a conventional summer-pattern tyre, but reduces the risk of aquaplaning considerably . At Goodyear's Mireval proving ground near Montpellier, France, last week, I watched two family hatchbacks drive round a 200-metre circle with a 30-metre segment flooded by 8mm of water. One car was on normal tyres, the other on Aquatreds. At about 60 kph (37 kph), both kept on line when hitting the water. As speed rose, one ran wider and wider until, at 85 kph (53 mph), it aquaplaned out of control. But not the car with Aquatreds. I then drove several Aquatred-shod cars on Mireval's handling circuit. In the dry, they rode, steered and handled as they would on the best normal tyres. On a surface like that of a winding country road during a summer downpour, the Aquatreds let me corner and brake as though it were merely damp. Ideally, Aquatreds - which will last as long as tyres with conventionally patterns - should be fitted in sets but you could start with a pair on the back wheels. They are a logical choice for motorists who give wet-weather safety high priority.   Companies:-  Ford Motor.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT931-9191 ,"FT931-9191 _AN-DBPBVAA2FT 930216   FT  16 FEB 93 / Chinese find growing affluence takes a toll as traffic snarls and road deaths mount      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   ECONOMIC reforms may have brought spectacular material rewards to millions of Chinese, but growing affluence is also taking its toll - on the country's roads. China reported 60,000 fatalities last year, an increase of 10 per cent on the year before, but the actual toll could be much higher, perhaps as many as 100,000 road deaths. An official of the Traffic Control Department of the Ministry of Public Security said the official figure of 60,000 fatalities had 'a lot of water in it' - a Chinese expression indicating that the official statistic under-estimated the gravity of the situation. 'The real figure can't be published because it's just too shocking,' he said. 'The internal estimate was 100,000 last year.' China's economic boom - the economy grew by a staggering 12 per cent in 1992  -has brought with it a flood of new vehicles on to the country's already congested roads. Traffic jams are now the rule rather than the exception in many of China's cities. Beijing's traffic has become particularly heavy in the past year due in part to a surge of new joint ventures involving foreign participation. According to a recent New China News Agency despatch, China, with a population of 1.1bn, had 6m cars, buses and trucks using its roads. But this official figure almost certainly understates vehicle numbers. China's approach to road safety seems haphazard and limited resources appear to have been devoted to publicity campaigns. That may be about to change, as the cost to the community of road trauma dawns on the authorities. One indication of growing official concern is that two decades after most western countries introduced seat belt regulations, China is to follow suit. By July, new vehicles will be required to fit belts as standard equipment. Vehicles already on the road will be required to conform or be deemed unroadworthy. Fines for non-use of seat belts will be five yuan (about 60 pence), a fairly derisory amount if the Chinese are indeed serious about improving road safety. According to the spokesman for the Public Security Ministry's traffic department, some 70 per cent of road accidents occurred in country areas where ignorance of road safety and traffic rules tended to be greater. The official blamed bad driving for most of the accidents. 'The driving standards of Chinese motorists are very poor,' he said. 'They don't care about traffic rules. Once they get on the road they drive like crazy.' Mr Yang Jinyao, deputy principal of the Beijing Driver's Training School, said that in the capital drivers were subjected to a rigorous training schedule, but with the rapid increase of numbers of cars on the road it was inevitable the toll would rise. He said Chinese drivers were certainly not as safety conscious as westerners. Drink-driving was also a main problem. He estimated that about one third of serious accidents involved a drunk driver. As more and more Chinese take to the roads in motor vehicles, forsaking the push-bike that had transported them with relative safety for so many years, they are beginning to take out accident insurance. But numbers availing themselves of this protection are still small, according to a representative of the People's Insurance Company of China. Third party insurance is compulsory.

The company has a highly regarded pan-European distribution network with around 1,300 sales and service outlets. Access to such a distribution system would be highly valued by any truck producer seeking to enter the European market from outside the region. Leyland-Daf has a share of nearly 8 per cent of the west European truck market, putting it in sixth place, but it is in the UK that it has established a commanding presence since its takeover of Leyland Vehicles in 1987. At the same time Leyland-Daf has a relatively modern truck range and has made substantial investments in new products in the last two years. Last year it launched a new range of medium/heavy duty trucks, the 75/85 series, which was the result of a four-year investment programme worth more than Pounds 170m. Last autumn Leyland-Daf began a search for a 'strategic alliance' and began negotiations with Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany. Mercedes-Benz quickly insisted that it was not willing to take an equity stake in Leyland-Daf, but it has admitted that detailed negotiations have taken place over an exchange of components or products. Leyland-Daf's operations in the UK represent a mixed challenge for any buyer. The plant at Leyland, Lancashire, is relatively modern, produces a competitive range of light-duty trucks, and has a large potential capacity. It could offer an attractive low-cost production base in Europe, in particular for producers with a high cost base in Germany. By contrast, the van operation in Birmingham appears much more at risk. The plant, formerly British Leyland's Freight Rover van operation, is old and the product range is also rather out-of-date in spite of recent efforts to revamp it. The future of this plant is in question. Leyland-Daf entered a joint venture with Renault of France three years ago to develop a new van range for the mid 1990s. Around 50 Renault engineers are working in Birmingham, and the two companies have formed a joint venture, Van Technology, to develop the new product. Renault said yesterday it was studying the 'repercussions' on the van project of Leyland-Daf's problems. Privately Renault has been well aware of the growing financial crisis at Leyland-Daf and has been seeking to prepare contingency plans. The truck operations are most likely to be rescued from outside Europe. Paccar, the US producer, showed a strong interest in a possible deal with Leyland Vehicles when British Leyland was seeking to shed the truck and van operations in 1986-87, before the merger was finally agreed with Leyland-Daf. However, Paccar has only a minor presence in the European market through Foden, the specialist UK heavy truck maker. The pan-European distribution network with its particular expertise in heavy trucks could also provide the entry ticket to Europe for one of the leading Japanese producers, Hino (Toyota), Nissan Diesel, Mitsubishi or Isuzu. The Japanese presence in the European heavy truck industry is negligible and analysts have always argued that the lack of a pan-European service network would make such entry prohibitively expensive.

Mr Burns acknowledges that Unipart bought AES from Beans - which prior to the sale also reconditioned engines for Unipart - solely because of the Toyota contracts and the chance to start a long-term relationship with Japan's largest carmaker.

Saturn was founded by GM as a stand-alone company capable of directing its own destiny. Now that it is turning the corner GM should be willing to allow outside investors to participate so that Saturn can realise its full business potential - thereby benefiting GM as well. Such a strategy would enhance Saturn's stand-alone authority and responsibility and help accelerate its long-overdue export programme. The global fame of this pioneering project is not yet being significantly exploited in markets outside North America.

One-third of the injuries and illnesses were  in manufacturing, which accounts for more than 20% of the work force.    One of every 11 workers will be seriously injured or killed at work, according  to the National Safe Workplace Institute.    A U.S. worker is injured every 16 seconds and one of every six workers will die  from occupation-related diseases, the institute said.    Disabilities    Permanent work-related disabilities rose from 60,000 to 70,000 from 1986 to  1987 -- nearly a 17% increase, the National Safety Council said.    However, the rate of disabling work injuries per 1 million exposure hours  dropped from 8.3 to 8.1 in the same period, the council noted.    Dangerous Industries    In 1987, ship building and repairing led the nation with 40.1 injuries and  illnesses per 100 full-time workers, the government said. Among other hazardous  industries were meatpacking and mobile homes construction.    U.S. vs. Others    The United States had the highest worker fatality rate compared with six other  industrialized nations, the workplace institute said. Figures compiled by the  International Labor Office showed the industrial accident death rate was 3.6  per 100,000 workers.    Japan was second-highest with 2.3 deaths, followed by Italy, 1.6; France, 1;  West Germany, 0.8; the United Kingdom, 0.4; Sweden, 0.1. (All figures 1986  except Italy, 1984).    Repetitive Trauma    Reported repetitive trauma disorder cases, including hearing loss, rose from  26,700 in 1983 to 72,940 in 1987, the government said.    Such cases accounted for 38% of occupational illnesses in 1987, contrasted with  28% in 1984, according to a Labor Department survey. Such ailments hit 4 of  every 100 poultry processing and meatpacking workers in 1987.    Meatpacking    More than a third of packinghouse workers will suffer a serious illness or  injury this year, translating into more than 52,000 workers annually or 200  daily, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union said.    Between 1981 and 1983, meatpacking production jumped by 52%, the union said,  while employment declined by almost 20%.    Poultry    Workers doing evisceration work handled 50 to 70 birds a minute in the '70s;  now they're processing up to 90 birds a minute, the Institute for Southern  Studies said.    Construction, Mining and Manufacturing    In construction, total lost workdays per 100 workers in 1987 came to 135.8,  contrasted with 69.9 for all private-sector industries, the government said.  The comparable statistic was 144 in mining and 95.5 in manufacturing.    Autos    Total injury rates in large plants in the motor vehicle industry reported to  the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1987 were 2.5 times those reported in 1985,  according to congressional testimony by the United Autoworkers Union.

The financial pressures on Isuzu, which has made a loss for three years, recently forced it to announce it was withdrawing from car manufacturing to concentrate on vans and commercial vehicles. It has formed an alliance with Honda of Japan, which will supply it with cars, while Isuzu will supply Honda with recreational vehicles. Isuzu has also formed important alliances with other automotive companies covering for the joint supply of components. Isuzu's pre-tax loss last year was down from the Y54bn in 1991. The company's sales rose by 3.7 per cent to Y1,580bn. Overseas sales accounted for 51 per cent of its turnover.   Companies:-  Isuzu Motors.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

In a speech earlier this month, Bush made the anti-crime legislation, along  with a cut in the capital gains tax and a clean air bill, the top items on his  legislative agenda for the congressional session.    ""It's time -- it's past time for Congress to tend to some of the unfinished  business,"" Bush said. ""It's time for Congress to act quickly and responsibly  because the war on drugs and crime won't wait.""    Although Bush's words make music in an election year, the rhetoric obscures the  reality that most of the program the President proposed in May passed as part  of anti-drug legislation last year.    Of the 19 principal issues in the sweeping anti-crime proposal, only four are  left -- those dealing with the death penalty, revisions in the habeas corpus  and exclusionary rules and controls of firearms.    Under an agreement reached by Senate Democratic and Republican leaders, these  four will be considered beginning Feb. 7 as part of an anti-crime package.    In the House, where several subcommittees will be involved and where no  hearings have been held, the situation is less clear.    But Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) who late last year introduced a version  of the Administration's remaining proposals, said at the time that the four  items ""do not do much to impact on drugs, if at all, and arguably may, or may  not, reduce crime.    Biden said he was not convinced that they will ""do very much to produce any  significant change in the crime picture in America. The realities of these  proposals will do little, if anything.""    The bill alters procedures to meet Supreme Court guidelines for the death  penalty for 16 crimes -- such as treason and espionage -- and adds the ultimate  sentence for seven crimes -- genocide, murder of a foreign official, murder by  a federal prisoner, kidnaping, hostage-taking, murder for hire and murder in  the aid of racketeering.    But the bill introduced by Biden, unlike the one that came from the White  House, would bar the death sentence if it furthers a ""racially discriminatory  pattern.""    The other parts would limit appeals by Death Row inmates, write into law the  ""good faith"" exemption for searches without warrant and ban the manufacture,  sale and possession of nine weapons.    To this, Biden added new sections to fight money laundering and to create an  Organized Crime and Dangerous Drug Division.    Although the revised and expanded Administration proposals will serve as the  vehicle when the Senate opens debate, Biden has his own more ambitious plan and  the Administration will propose a new anti-drug program Jan. 29 that will  include anti-crime elements.    For instance, the Administration, pressed by drug czar William Bennett, wants  the death penalty for drug kingpins, even if they are not involved in murder.    The death penalty for drug kingpins linked to murder was approved by Congress  in 1988 but no case has been brought under that statute.    Biden approaches anti-crime legislation in a far different manner, and his  package does not include the death penalty or the revisions of the habeas  corpus and exclusionary rules.    He proposes an additional $600 million to help state and local authorities  fight crime; 1,000 new FBI and 350 new drug agents, 300 prosecutors and 20  federal judges; aid to rural police battling drugs; no bail for drug offenses;  expanded program of forfeiture by those convicted of drug crimes; new statutes  to crack down on public corruption at the state and local level; power to shut  down crack houses; more money to combat juvenile gangs; aid to communities  suffering from a high level of drug trafficking (also expected to be in the  Administration's new anti-drug program); a Peace Corps-type program to lure  people into law enforcement work; increasing penalties for gun-related crimes,  and permitting undercover investigations of receivers of stolen property.

0,FT932-7822 ,"FT932-7822 _AN-DEUB0AEVFT 930521   FT  21 MAY 93 / Observer: Not so happy birthday   Things have looked pretty bleak for Franz Steinkuhler, Germany's cigar-smoking top trade unionist, in the past few days, after all the publicity about his dealings in Daimler-Benz shares. So nice to note that, just in time for his 56th birthday yesterday, he has been getting a few loyal messages among the flood of predictable calls for his resignation. The engineering union loyalists quoted an old proverb from the Ruhr, to the effect that: 'It's the chap who does the work who makes the mistakes. An idle bloke never blunders.' While the Mercedes works councils say Steinkuhler is an embarrassment (he sits on Daimler's supervisory board), the boys at Volkswagen (where he's also on the supervisory board) say magnanimously they think a bit of solidarity is in order even if their leaders are prone to err.

As part of a vigorous defence of its safety record, GM argued that its trucks performed within federal safety requirements when tested recently by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Last month, the NHTSA asked the government to request the trucks' recall because it believed the placing of the fuel tanks outside the vehicles' frames made them more prone to fire risk in a collision. GM, however, said that the NHTSA judged the GM trucks unsafe compared to other manufacturers' trucks because it applied safety standards beyond those normally set by the government. The company also said the NHTSA ignored safety data compiled by state authorities which showed that its trucks were as safe, or safer than, other similar models.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.

The increased output reflected the Birmingham-based group's continuing high export content. More than 70 per cent of vehicles were exported to about 100 markets worldwide. The increase was due entirely to the Discovery model launched by Land Rover in 1990. Its output jumped by 26.4 per cent last year to 24,347. Production of the more luxurious Range Rover and the utility Land Rover models each fell by about 6 per cent. The company, which refused yesterday to forecast likely sales or production for the current year, had to step up production twice in the second half of last year and resort to Saturday working to meet demand for the Discovery.

Rejecting claims from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, that VW's hiring the men breached fair competition rules, the court said in a written ruling that Mr Lopez's colleagues had tried to persuade him to stay with GM. In the event they needed no urging, having already told him before he decided to go that they wanted to continue working with him whatever happened. The court also said that Opel had failed to convince it that any knowledge its former employees took with them was confidential and could not be transferred to VW. Opel still plans to proceed with a full hearing on the case, and, meanwhile, investigations are continuing into possible charges of industrial espionage against Mr Lopez and his associates.

Appendix A to Subpart B_Compliance Assistance Guidelines for Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres       This Appendix is a non-mandatory set of guidelines provided to assist employers in complying with the requirements of this subpart. This Appendix neither creates additional obligations nor detracts from obligations otherwise contained in the standard. It is intended to provide explanatory information and educational material to employers and employees to foster understanding of, and compliance with, the standard.       Sections 1915.11 through 1915.16.     These standards are minimum safety standards for entering and working safely in vessel tanks and compartments.       Section 1915.11(b)Definition of ``Hot work.''     There are several instances in which circumstances do not necessitate that grinding, drilling, abrasive blasting be regarded as hot work. Some examples are:   1. Abrasive blasting of the hull for paint preparation does not necessitate pumping and cleaning the tanks of a vessel.   2. Prior to hot work on any hollow structure, the void space should be tested and appropriate precautions taken.       Section 1915.11(b)Definition of ``Lower explosive limit.''     The terms lower flammable limit (LFL) and lower explosive limit (LEL) are used interchangeably in fire science literature.       Section 1915.11(b)Definition of ``Upper explosive limit.''     The terms upper flammable limit (UFL) and upper explosive limit (UEL) are used interchangeably in fire science literature.       Section 1915.12(a)(4).     After a tank has been properly washed and ventilated, the tank should contain 20.8 percent oxygen by volume. This is the same amount found in our normal atmosphere at sea level. However, it is possible that the oxygen content will be lower. When this is the case, the reasons for this deficiency should be determined and corrective action taken.   An oxygen content of 19.5 percent can support life and is adequate for entry. However, any oxygen level less than 20.8 percent and greater than 19.5 percent level should also alert the competent person to look for the causes of the oxygen deficiency and to correct them prior to entry.       Section 1915.12(b)(4)Flammable atmospheres.     Atmospheres with a concentration of flammable vapors at or above 10 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) are considered hazardous when located in confined spaces. However, atmospheres with flammable vapors below 10 percent of the LEL are not necessarily safe.   Such atmospheres are too lean to burn. Nevertheless, when a space contains or produces measurable flammable vapors below the 10 percent LEL, it might indicate that flammable vapors are being released or introduced into the space and could present a hazard in time. Therefore, the cause of the vapors should be investigated and, if possible, eliminated prior to entry.   Some situations that have produced measurable concentrations of flammable vapors that could exceed 10 percent of the LEL in time are:   1. Pipelines that should have been blanked or disconnected have opened, allowing product into the space.   2. The vessel may have shifted, allowing product not previously cleaned and removed during washing to move into other areas of the vessel.   3. Residues may be producing the atmosphere by releasing flammable vapor.       Section 1915.12(b)(6)Flammable atmospheres that are toxic.     An atmosphere with a measurable concentration of a flammable substance below 10 percent of the LEL may be above the OSHA permissible exposure limit for that substance. In that case, refer to 1915.12(c) (2), (3), and (4).       Section 1915.13(b)(4), 1915.15(c), and 1915.15(e).     The frequency with which a tank is monitored to determine if atmospheric conditions are being maintained is a function of several factors that are discussed below:          "
0,FT933-4203 ,"FT933-4203 _AN-DIIB8AHDFT 930909   FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (22): Trickle turns into a torrent - China      By MARK PAYNE   THE Chinese motor vehicle market and industry is currently one of the world's most dynamic automotive sectors. During the 1980s, several Chinese companies concluded licensing agreements with foreign vehicle manufacturers for the local assembly of selected models. Joint ventures with foreign companies also began to make their appearance in a trickle of deals which has recently turned into a torrent. There has been what has, at times, looked almost like a rush by western vehicle manufacturers to put down a marker in the rapidly-growing (and potentially very rich) Chinese market for all types of vehicles. The Chinese government has welcomed this process, with Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, citing vehicle manufacture as one of the four central pillars of Chinese industry. Technology transfer is actively sought; China is eager to learn from the expertise of the world's vehicle multinationals. The sector is very highly fragmented, with a large number of relatively small-scale operations likely to characterise the industry for the 1990s. This situation will surely start to change early in the next century, however, given the strength of the vehicle market where growth prospects seem virtually limitless. An equally important influence is the rapid growth of the Chinese economy and the liberalisation of economic and certain political attitudes, for example towards the creation of wealth and the personal ownership of the means of production. Not only will larger-scale vehicle manufacturing plants probably start to make their appearance in strength, but it is probable China will seek - either through the state or private-sector interests - to develop a truly indigenous motor vehicle design and manufacturing industry. Throughout the 1990s, the sector will concentrate on boosting output, improving efficiency and profitability, raising economies of scale and upgrading managerial and blue collar expertise and skills. Comprehensive figures for the levels of vehicle production and sales for any year in China are extremely difficult to come by, with assessments based on individual company releases and on the information put out by the China National Automotive Industry Corporation (CNAIC). Two things are clear, however. One is the rapid growth in passenger car and commercial vehicle production and sales in recent years. According to CNAIC, output last year reached 120,000 cars - excluding the Daihatsu Charade which is also assembled in China, and Beijing Jeep's aged 2020 four-wheel-drive vehicle - and 960,000 commercial vehicles. The other is that the sector will expand throughout the 1990s. The recently published Financial Times management report, The Emerging Asia-Pacific Automotive Industry: Growth and Opportunities from South Korea to Turkey, which examines the industry in depth, is forecasting that Chinese output of passenger cars could rise to 1.9m units by 2002, and that of commercial vehicles to 1.6m units. The potential size of the market explains the scramble since the start of the 1990s by western and Japanese vehicle manufacturers to establish or expand production, assembly or licensing business in China. Germany's Volkswagen group is in the process of increasing its level of investment. It has entered into two important joint ventures. The first is the Shanghai-Volkswagen Automobile Company, which in early 1992 announced that it was to increase annual output substantially at its Shanghai facility by 1995. The second is the FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company, which is constructing a plant in Jilin province, scheduled to come on stream by 1995. The second-largest carmaker in China is France's PSA group, which has two joint ventures. The first is Guangzhou Peugeot which assembles the 505 in the south of China, and the second, SAW Citroen Auto, which in the autumn of 1992 began to assemble the Citroen ZX hatchback. Among other European vehicle manufacturers, Mercedes-Benz has interests in the commercial vehicle sector in China, while Italy's Iveco has a tie-up with Nanjing Motor for the production of light trucks. Two of America's Big Three are building a strong presence. Chrysler has a shareholding in the Beijing Jeep Company, which manufactures the Cherokee four-wheel-drive vehicle. At the start of 1992 General Motors formed a joint venture with the Chinese van and light truck producer, Jinbei Automotive. Most Japanese carmakers have already concluded joint ventures or technical assistance agreements in China. These ventures include Zhengzhou Nissan Automobile, the Hainan Mazda Motor and Stamping Company, the Jiangling-Isuzu Motors Company, the Changan Suzuki Automobile Company and the Shenyang Jinbei Passenger Vehicle Manufacturing Company, in which Toyota is in partnership with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings. In addition, Daihatsu and Fuji Heavy Industries have technical assistance agreements with Chinese vehicle manufacturers. Other Asian vehicle producers are also eyeing opportunities in China. These include South Korea's Kia Motors, which has announced a joint venture for the assembly of passenger cars and components in Yanji City.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.

The ""Happiness"" brand motor vehicles were made by Yichu  Company, a joint venture established ten years ago by the Chia  Tai group of Thailand and Shanghai.    It is the first time for 20 years that Thailand will approve  such imports, according to company officials. Thai laws  prohibit import of assembled motor vehicles.    The vehicles were bought by the Chia Tai group, which will  present them to the Thai imperial house.    It will be a great chance for promotion, said Li Jingai,  deputy general manager of Yichu.    Yichu produced 238,000 motor vehicles last year, which were  all sold, and reported a sales volume of 1.5 billion yuan.    It will produce about 280,000 vehicles this year, with a  sales volume of some two billion yuan, a top company official  said.     "

It cost the UK motor industry millions of pounds to supply the MMC with the information it sought. The evidence enabled the MMC to conclude, with authority, that the motor industry was not abusing its market power or operating against the public interest. Surely a large, highly complex industry employing three-quarters of a million people requires thorough consideration by an independent panel of experts if massive damage to Britain's industrial structure is to be avoided. This must be better than precipitate action by other bodies, like the Consumers' Association, which appear to have already made up their minds before they start an investigation.

Volkswagen acquired VAG (United Kingdom), the British distributor of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, from Lonrho, the UK-based international trading group, for Pounds 124m at the end of last year. Following the takeover the German carmaker wants to expand substantially its presence in Britain, which has traditionally been one of its weakest markets in Europe. Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of west European new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent in the UK. The company has set a target of capturing 7.5 per cent of UK new-car sales by 1998. VW will change its traditional premium pricing in the UK and be seeking higher fleet and company car sales.

Good youngsters are, too. Anybody's children.    Parents don't know how often their children are exposed to dangerous situations  that mix driving and drinking, says Dr. James Farrow, who has studied the  issue. And parents aren't doing enough, says Farrow, director of the division  of adolescent medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle.    His research, conducted in 1987 and 1988, surveyed 192 young drivers in  Seattle-area public high schools. It found a high degree of alcohol and drug  use with driving among teen-agers. The findings, he says, apply to ""virtually  any suburban area of any city in the country.""    Among his findings:     -- After using alcohol and drugs, youngsters drive even though they know they  are impaired.     -- Driving while intoxicated is seen as a normal part of social life among  teen-agers. Driving around with friends is a social event in itself.     -- Dangerous driving incidents are characterized by reckless intent, driving  late at night and having friends in the car, with alcohol or drugs being used.     -- The most dangerous driving takes place after a party, followed by driving  after spending time with friends at one's home, or theirs.     -- Highest rates of driving after drinking are among teen-agers who have had  their licenses less than six months.     -- Many teen-agers think beer is less intoxicating than other kinds of  alcohol.     -- Boys are more at risk for driving dangerously than girls, who are more  often passengers in dangerous driving incidents.    Teen-agers can be well aware of the dangers, Farrow says, but often don't  believe that it can happen to them. Many passengers in dangerous driving  situations later told him that though they were scared at the time, they would  ride again with the same driver under the same circumstances.    ""That's the issue that's special to the adolescent driving problem -- they feel  invulnerable,"" he says.    Farrow, who recently spoke about his research at a meeting of the American  Academy of Pediatrics in Seattle, says the problem needs to be fought in  several ways, including such student efforts as the ""contract for life"" and  Students Against Drunk Drivers campaigns, legal deterrents and education.    An educational program Farrow and colleagues developed, conducted in the  Seattle area, tells parents what situations and personality characteristics  most put teen-agers at risk. In brainstorming sessions, parents then try to  come up with strategies to reduce danger for their own children.    ""Parents try to do the same thing some state legislators try to do -- make  driving provisional,"" he says.

Because research has shown teen-agers are more likely to be in dangerous  driving situations Fridays and Saturdays after 10 p.m. and in the summer,  parents can consider curfews accordingly. Because having friends in the car is  a risk, they can set limits about who or how many passengers will be allowed.    A teen-ager's personality also has to be considered. Research suggests that  youths who are more likely to be involved in drunk-driving incidents are more  likely to have troubles with anger or hostility or a feeling of powerlessness  and have recently dealt with a stressful change (such as moving to a new home  or failing a grade). Other risk factors are a lack of responsibility, thinking  of the car as a status symbol and having a poor relationship with the family.    Farrow also found that teen-agers were less likely to be involved in dangerous  driving when using their own cars, rather than the family car.

0,FT931-15867 ,"FT931-15867 _AN-DAJAPABJFT 930109   FT  09 JAN 93 / Ford joins race for television exposure: Why carmakers are putting their 'ordinary' models into motor sport      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   JUST 24 hours after releasing the Mondeo, the family-sized 'world' car on which Ford's financial future heavily depends, the company's UK subsidiary this week announced that Mondeos are destined for the race track as well as the showroom. Ford of Britain announced that it will introduce two of the new cars in the 14-round British Touring Car Championship. Although motor racing budgets are never formally disclosed, Ford of Britain does not dispute that the cost by the end of the season could be much more than Pounds 1m. To some the exercise may seem an inexcusable frivolity for a company that made record losses last year. But Ford of Britain believes that to establish the Mondeo in a marketplace crowded with more rivals than when its Sierra predecessor was launched 11 years ago, the racing budget is relatively small compared with the global total of Pounds 4bn invested in the model. The exercise could prove to be highly cost-effective. Ford is not alone in this view. To the surprise of the RAC Motor Sports Association - the governing body of UK motor sport - the racing action and the strong resemblance of the race cars to showroom models has attracted the interest of of television. Such interest is highly valued by carmakers and commercial sponsors. With every round of the championship being televised by BBC's high-profile Grandstand programme and race highlights regularly carried on ITV, coverage of the championship could rank second only to that of grand prix racing. 'It's giving us the kind of exposure that you simply cannot buy,' said Mr Brian Llewelyn, public affairs director for Peugeot Talbot, whose two-car Peugeot 405 team is being led by former touring car champion Rob Gravett. With BBC TV contracted to televise both the 1993 and 1994 seasons - and taking an option on 1995-96 - manufacturers are flocking to the championship. Mercedes Benz is expected to announce that it too is joining the touring car championship fray. Meanwhile, Renault is launching a two-car team this year. Japan's Mazda is entering its new executive car, the Xedos 6. Apparently Mazda believes that should the Xedos be seen fighting against BMW in the championship it could win the type of respect given by European buyers to the blue-and-white badged cars from Munich. This week a delegation from Audi was at Donington Park, the Midlands racing circuit, to assess whether it, too, should develop appropriate cars. The newcomers will join a starting grid that even last season - the second in the championship's 2-litre form - was starting to resemble a roll call of the world's volume car industry, including Toyota, Nissan, Peugeot and General Motors' Vauxhall. 'The question now is not so much who is coming in, but whether any of the big manufacturers can afford to stay out,' says Mr Jonathan Ashman, marketing director of the RAC Motor Sports Association and the chief architect of the championship. The motor industry and companies in the tobacco, clothing and drinks sectors that use motor sport to promote their products acknowledge there is no mathematical formula linking pounds expended to extra sales achieved. However, press column inches and air time can be measured. Mr Llewelyn of Peugeot Talbot says: 'We measured the time we got on-screen just in the reshowings of the 1992 championship's highlights on TV over Christmas - and buying it would have cost us nearly Pounds 3m.' The contrast with grand prix motor racing costs is stark. Williams-Renault admits to a Pounds 20m budget, excluding its Renault-supplied engines. McLaren's is considerably more. Most costs are borne by large sponsors such as the tobacco group Philip Morris and the Benetton clothing empire. On that basis the Pounds 1m or so that BMW and Vauxhall - which took the driver's and manufacturer's touring car titles respectively last year - and most other manufacturers will spend on this year's championship is very small indeed. Some of that money will be recouped from Securicor, electronics group Philips, Listerine mouthwash, Canadian brewer Labatt and other non-industry sponsors. In comparison with the 100m global audiences for each grand prix, media coverage has also been much smaller. The dramatic development is that most of the world, excluding North America, is adopting the British 2-litre rules, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Australia, the entire Asia Pacific region and South Africa. At the end of this year there will be a European Cup, with each nation sending a team of drivers to compete. Within the next couple of years it is almost certain a new world championship will exist for cars similar to those 'ordinary' motorists drive, rather than grand prix exotica.

A new book suggests tips based on a musician's experience      By JEFFREY BOYLING   Barely a week goes by without news that some sporting personality has had to 'retire' or at least rest because of injury. Their high profile always guarantees a mention. But what of aches, pains and injuries sustained by people in the workplace and in particular those using computer keyboards? The problems of tenosynovitis, tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome rarely get any coverage unless a compensation payment has been involved. Can anything be done to prevent the daily difficulties experienced by countless individuals? The Hand Book, published this week* may provide some answers. The author is Stephanie Brown, a New York-based professor of piano who has noted the injuries suffered by pianists. Brown has identified a direct link between incorrect, strained finger and hand positions at the keyboard and subsequent injury. Pianists with correct natural positions and movements had a keyboard style characterised by fluidity and an absence of injury. The application to computer keyboards became evident when Brown was learning how to operate her own computer. Many of her teachers used the same harmful positions and movements she had observed in pianists. Studying typing manuals highlighted the need for a preventative keyboard method. Unfortunately, many computer users have never learnt to type, which may put them at even greater risk of experiencing aches and pains. 'It's well known that certain positions and motions can cause injury in practically every sport,' says Brown. 'Everyone has had the experience of watching someone swing a tennis racquet or golf club and think, 'Ouch]' It just looks wrong. Using a computer keyboard is no different. It's a vigorous micro-athletic workout for the hands and fingers. Do it wrong and you're asking for trouble.' The Hand Book aims to help computer users prevent injuries by avoiding dangerous hand positions. These have been variously called The Dangerous Angle, The Cobra, The Spider and The Flying Pinky. Instead, keyboard users can experience the comfortable and relaxed feel of the correct position by working through a series of 14 easy to follow lessons, predominantly aimed at the hands. Other parts of the body - which can be responsible for symptoms in the hands - are either omitted or mentioned only briefly. The book advises on how to care for the hands and details are given of various stretches like the Teepee, Curl, Press and Tuck to maintain mobility. Athletes warm up before playing and so should computer users, says Brown. Details of exercises and massage during rest breaks from the screen are given for those body parts that need to be moved. There is nothing controversial in this but there are some parts that have not been stretched but which should be stretched to prevent some of the symptoms reported by keyboard users Of course there is more to preventing hand injuries at the keyboard and this is acknowledged in the book. Unfortunately the section on workstation adjustment is too brief and could be confusing for some readers. It also assumes that most keyboard users can adjust the height of the keyboard whereas the majority of users sit at desks of fixed height. However, the visual reminder of the Do's and Don'ts ('The Golden Rules') offers a useful summary. Here are some of them: Keep the natural wrist line; Let the wrists float; Let the elbows hang free; Relax the ring and little fingers; Don't squeeze the mouse; Rest the hands when not keying. *The Hand Book (Preventing Computer Injury), pp98.

Mr Bjorn Larsson, president of Volvo Bus, said the takeover of Drogmoller, a maker of luxury tourist coaches with a turnover last year of DM56m (Dollars 36m) and a workforce of 250, was an important step in the Swedish group's effort to break into the German market, which is dominated by Mercedes-Benz and MAN, the domestic German commercial vehicle makers. The big European truck and bus makers are moving quickly to consolidate their hold on the small, and hitherto independent, bus and coach body builders in Europe, in order to guarantee the outlets for their chassis and drivelines (engines and gearboxes).

0,FT932-3889 ,"FT932-3889 _AN-DFKB5AFOFT 930611   FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Brazil puts its foot on the accelerator - The government's efforts to get its citizens on the road      By BILL HINCHBERGER   Brazil's car market is booming. Despite the country's economic and political turmoil, the Brazilian car industry is on its way to reclaiming from Mexico the title of Latin America's leading car producer. During the first five months of 1993, production rose 33.8 per cent compared with 1992. Output reached an all-time high of 124,000 vehicles in May, beating the previous monthly high - October, 1980 - of 121,000. The industry looks capable of reaching its production goal of 1.2m this year. The buoyant market is providing a rare bright spot for Fiat, the Italian carmaker. Fiat do Brasil has been fast mopping up market share, capturing 21 per cent of domestic sales last year, up from 12 per cent in 1989. Having passed the long-standing number three manufacturer, Ford, Fiat is now closing in on number two, General Motors do Brasil. Fiat appears to be carving a substantial niche in lower priced small cars. Its compact Uno is now the second leading seller, trailing only the Gol hatchback, Volkswagen's long popular model sold exclusively in Brazil. This performance is leading to suggestions that Fiat do Brasil could soon become the sole producer of a new economy model, based on the Uno. The new model would be exported to Europe. The company, which shipped Dollars 842m of vehicles last year, was Brazil's leading private sector exporter. The Fiorino pick-up truck is already produced exclusively in Brazil. Some industry analysts nevertheless believe that Fiat's Brazilian push is related to the loss of market share in Italy and Europe. 'Fiat do Brasil is not going to be able to maintain its high levels of exports to Italy,' predicts one analyst. 'It has to depend on Brazil.' Fiat is meeting the increase in demand without large new investments, said Mr Pacifico Paoli who runs the car division of Fiat do Brasil. He plans to increase daily output from 900 vehicles in December 1992 to 1,400 by June 1994. However, investment in added capacity seems likely only if the main Fiat board in Turin decides to produce their new economy model there. A new model can only be manufactured in Brazil if the company is also confident of domestic demand. Despite the recent growth in market share in Brazil, Mr Paoli admits that Fiat do Brasil's chances of substantial parent company investment hinge largely on developments within the economy, not least a monthly inflation rate running close to 30 per cent. Nonetheless Mr Paoli sees better things to come: 'Brazil has to come out of its 10 year period of stagnation.' Already Brazilians are buying cars like never before. The industry got a jump start from February's tripartite accord between management, labour and government. The government has reduced taxes, industry has promised to squeeze margins, and the unions will hold wage demands to 6.3 per cent a year even though shop floor workers earn just Dollars 2.79 an hour. Coming on top of last year's pioneering union agreement, the pact means that for-sale sticker prices are effectively one third lower than they would otherwise be. Tax breaks are also helping to underpin demand. The idea is to get more Brazilians behind the wheel and help revive a sluggish economy. Last year the economy contracted by 1 per cent. According to the National Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers, 40 jobs are created in other industries by every new car industry job. The motor industry already accounts for 8 per cent of Brazil's gross domestic product. It is the bottom end of the market that appears to be most price sensitive. 'Car ownership in Brazil is even more concentrated than income,' says Mr Paoli. There is one car for every 11.4 Brazilians, compared to one for every 5.7 Argentines and one for 1.3 Americans. The most recent decree provides for a reduction of the federal value added tax from 14 per cent to 0.1 per cent. This is expected to result in wholesale price reductions of between 10 and 13 per cent for eligible models. Most of those models have 1,000cc engines. All Brazil's leading manufacturers - Autolatina (the joint venture between Volkswagen and Ford), General Motors and Fiat - have models eligible for the tax break. Small wonder perhaps that production of the Volkswagen Beetle, which ceased production in 1986, is scheduled to restart in Brazil in August. Although it has a 1,600cc engine, the Beetle will benefit from tax concessions. VW has already begun to predict that original production figures of 20,000 units a year may have to be increased.

Without a further breakdown the bare loss is difficult to interpret. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the new chairman, needs an atmosphere of crisis to force through change. Yet his comment that VW should break even this year seems at odds with the warning of worse pain to come. The 30 per cent rise in the shares since December suggests the market is convinced VW's problems are being addressed. The promise of up to 20,000 job cuts this year is tougher than before. The hard-hitting procurement team recruited from General Motors should rationalise VW's sprawling supply base. But the traffic is not all one-way. Even allowing Mr Piech some licence, selling cars in Germany will be tough this year and next. The devaluation of the Italian lira has cost VW competitiveness in its second biggest market.

It has affirmed Toyota's triple A long-term rating and removed the group from creditwatch. SP said that Nissan's poor financial performance led it to reduce the company's credit rating to BBB+ from A. 'Recovery of earnings will take a few years, as the company's efficiency continues to be affected by excess production capacity domestically and weak performance of overseas subsidiaries,' SP said. SP noted that Nissan continued to have a strong market position in Japan, global market presence and 'exceptional product development abilities as a full line producer of passenger cars'. American Honda had its credit rating lowered to A-2 from A-1. Honda's liquidity levels were low while earnings continue to be under pressure, the agency said.

Mr Luis Santos, the local government secretary of former President Corazon Aquino, was charged last Thursday along with six others with buying overpriced firefighting vehicles from a Japanese company. Mr Santos said in a radio interview that Mr Ramos, then defence chief, was responsible for the decision to buy the trucks. 'The one involved was the former defence sec-retary. I was not involved in that. I even tried to block payment for that transaction but I resigned before I could do so,' Mr Santos said. Prosecutors said the fire engines were bought in 1991 from Japan's Taihei after the Korean company Ssangyong was originally awarded the contract by the bidding committee because of its lower bid. Mr Santos, who was in charge of the police force, approved the purchase order, they added. The overpayment amounted to 41.7m pesos (Pounds 1m).   Countries:-  PHZ  Philippines, Asia.

Production by Nissan at its Sunderland plant was sharply lower and production by Vauxhall and Ford also fell. These declines were compensated by a strong rise in production by Rover and the build-up of production from the new Toyota and Honda plants. Jaguar and IBC Vehicles, the General Motors/Isuzu joint venture which produces the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera, also increased output.

If Rover can be successfully assimilated it will be a remarkable coup. However, it needs to be recalled that research demonstrates, and experience in this industry more than confirms, that the success ratio for mergers and acquisitions is no better than one in two. Also, BMW has got to where it is today by the successful management of organic growth, not through acquisition.

June production of all vehicles, adjusted to allow for an extra working day this year, was 29 per cent lower than a year earlier at 344,000. Unadjusted output was down 25 per cent. However, the VDA said the decline in the car industry appeared to have reached bottom, but conditions for commercial vehicle makers were continuing to deteriorate. June's poor performance brought the cumulative decline in German motor manufacturers' output to 25 per cent for the first half of this year. In absolute figures, car production has tumbled 625,000 to 1.975m units. Car exports, which account for around half the industry's output, were 19 per cent lower in June than a year earlier. Output of light trucks up to 6 tonnes fell 34 per cent or 37,000 units to 72,000 between January and June.

The signatories also will ban imports of used vehicles, or new vehicles from earlier model years.

Participants said the new pact would cover about 70 per cent of the Andean vehicle market, which includes Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.

Furthermore, he would neither confirm nor deny German media reports that plans for a revolutionary new VW car factory had been found to be virtually identical to a similar secret project on which Mr Lopez worked while at GM.

There is also no sign that BAe is even preparing to hang out the 'for sale' sign, with Rover on the verge of returning to trading profit and being the only carmaker boasting increased sales in depressed European Community markets. Volkswagen/Audi, whose dash for European market supremacy through acquisition once made it a favourite to snap up Rover, is too financially troubled. Ford almost certainly would have felt obliged to prevent a VW takeover. But it is making heavy losses of its own. 'The best result is that Rover remains the industrial equivalent of Belgium,' says Professor Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School's motor industry research centre, who is one of the leading analysts of the vehicle group's fortunes. Nor are other large players circling Rover with any apparent interest. Even Honda, with which Rover has a 20 per cent cross-shareholding, professes no desire for control, although it may consider a slightly increased shareholding. One reason is the depressed climate in which the European motor industry is operating. West European sales are down 17.7 per cent so far this year. Yet even if the climate were better, Ford's struggle to make its Pounds 1.6bn purchase of Jaguar pay, and General Motors' similar struggles with Saab, have made the industry wary. Vehicle companies struggling to make the grade can be deep financial pits and Rover in its various previous guises - as BL, British Leyland and BMC - has been among the deepest. Over nearly two decades, Pounds 3.5bn of British taxpayers' funds were poured into its operations before privatisation. The fundamental question now is whether the UK's climb out of its steepest post-war car sales slump and Rover's strong progress in continental Europe and North America are enough to provide it with a viable long-term future. As Prof Rhys and other motor industry analysts point out, Rover has had an embarrassing number of 'false dawns' in which supposedly attractive new model programmes have failed to live up to their promise and brief spurts into profitability have fallen back into loss and indebtedness. Rover has only recently begun reversing its prolonged market-share decline in the UK, from more than 40 per cent in the 1960s to 13 per cent to 14 per cent by the early 1990s. Prof Rhys says: 'That Rover has become a small player in the European industry has been perceived as it simply being a failed mass producer. But there is a growing perception that its relative smallness is now by choice, as a specialist manufacturer.' It is increasingly accepted that the serious push to take Rover's products up-market, started by former chairman Sir Graham Day and developed by his successor Mr George Simpson and colleagues such as managing director Mr John Towers, is working. The smaller 200/400 car range has re-established Rover as a serious competitor in this market segment. After a Pounds 200m investment to transform production facilities at Cowley, Oxford, the Rover 800 has become a market leader in the UK executive car sector. Comparisons of the recently launched Rover 600 with BMW provides further evidence that the strategy is working. The 600's Honda Accord counterpart is being built by Honda at Swindon. Production of Discovery and Range Rover models cannot keep pace with demand, and Rover expects to quadruple sales of these vehicles, to 16,000 units annually, in the US alone over the next two years. Cowley reflects the new flexibility in production processes and among the company's 33,000-strong workforce. The plant is able to build the ageing Montego and Maestro models for as long as demand at even a few thousand a year persists. Alongside that process, the MG RV8 sports car, one of a growing number of niche vehicles being brought to market by Rover's new special projects division, is being virtually assembled by hand. Mr Towers points out that everyone at Cowley, from managers to receptionists, is a standby member of assembly-line teams. Large productivity improvements - a claimed 18 per cent at Cowley so far this year - and the introduction of 'lean' distribution which has taken thousands of cars out of the supply pipeline, are also driving costs down. Mr Towers says Rover is close to its target of financial break even at 400,000 cars a year. Last year's production was only 405,000, however, and output is down marginally again this year. Analysts still expect Rover to achieve a trading profit of Pounds 30m to Pounds 50m this year due mainly to its rigorous cost-cutting. Yet with current debts of some Pounds 400m Rover would still be making a net loss. Next year recovery should lift profits to between Pounds 90m and Pounds 100m and Rover should move closer to its proclaimed ideal volume of about 500,000 vehicles a year. Analysts are asking whether, given the fiercely competitive state of markets, such a volume will be enough to provide adequate profitability while sustaining investments of more than Pounds 200m a year. Prof Rhys believes that Rover may have to lift output substantially beyond the 500,000 level. Between its Longbridge and Cowley plants Rover retains a theoretical capacity of nearly 1m units. To utilise capacity more effectively would require new models. Nevertheless Rover's management ranks maintain that sustained viability is no longer in doubt. Those ranks may well seek to stake their futures on that view. There is growing talk of a management buy-out proposal for next spring.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LOCATION AND MAIN ACTIVITIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LONGBRIDGE         Engines and gearboxes, Mini, Metro, Rover 200 and                    Honda Concerto production GAYDON             Product proving ground                    Advanced engineering                    Test facilities SWINDON            Rover bodies and pressings SOLIHULL           Land Rover Defender, Discovery and Range Rover                    production, engines and gearboxes BICKENHILL         Corporate headquarters COWLEY             Maestro, Montego, Rover 800, Rover 600  MG RV8                    vehicle production  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPANY PROFILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual sales revenue               Pounds 3.684bn Export sales reveue                Pounds 1.159bn Vehicles sold                             421,000 Vehicles produced                         405,000 Employees                                  33,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Biggest UK car producer            30% of all UK production Biggest UK car exporter            31% of all UK exports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Rover Group.

Mr Franco Macri, whose Argentine company Sevel builds Fiats and Peugeots under licence, said planning was still at a very early stage. However, the new project already figured in Fiat's L40bn (Pounds 16m) long-term investment planning up to the year 2000. Fiat owns its Brazilian subsidiary outright, but only 15 per cent of Sevel. Production will maximise available industrial capacity in Argentina and Brazil. The two companies will buy components from suppliers on both sides of the frontier, and to a lesser extent from elsewhere. As well as selling in Brazil and Argentina, the car would be exported to Italy and other markets. Both countries' car industries have developed strong trade links in recent years. Sevel already swaps vehicles, motors and gearboxes with Brazil and its parent company's factories in the rest of the world.   Companies:-  Fiat.     Sevel Argentina.

This is not consistent with the policy relating to stationary sources, which can trade offsets between one nonattainment area and another in the northeast ozone transport region. This policy was established in a March 31, 1993 letter from John Seitz, the Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards to Bruce S. Carhart, the Executive Director of the Ozone Transport Commission. Furthermore, EPA has no reason to believe that trading would not be equitable across the two nonattainment areas. Therefore, the Region's position is that since the New Jersey program exists in two contiguous severe nonattainment areas within the State, trading should be allowed across the nonattainment area boundaries in the New Jersey program, and EPA proposes to accept this provision of the New Jersey rule.       3. Giving Full Credit for Alternative Fuel Vehicles       The State's rule allows for not including alternatively fueled vehicles as a vehicle in the calculation of occupancy rates. EPA's policy has been that alternatively fueled vehicles may be exempted from counting as a full vehicle.     EPA believes that this provision of the New Jersey rule will have a minor impact on the program's effectiveness since it is unlikely that many employees will have access to alternative fueled passenger cars. It is more likely that some multi-passenger vans or buses will be alternatively fueled and these will be excluded from the count of vehicles because of their capacity even without the exclusion for alternative fuels. Therefore, EPA proposes to accept this provision of the New Jersey Rule.       4. Giving Full Credit for Seven and Eight Passenger Vehicles       The State's rule counts vanpools arriving at the worksite with seven or eight employees as ``zero vehicles arriving.'' EPA's policy allows only nine passenger and greater vehicles not to be counted as a vehicle arriving at a worksite.   EPA believes that although this provision in the rule will allow some smaller vans and larger station wagons carrying seven or eight employees to be excluded from the count of vehicles arriving at a worksite, that this will not be a significant number of vehicles beyond those already excluded by EPA's policy and will allow employers the flexibility to arrange for vehicles of a size which best fits their needs. Therefore, EPA proposes to accept this provision of the New Jersey Rule.       IV. Conclusion       In this proposal, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision submitted by the State of New Jersey which contains the ETR program. This submittal addresses and implements each of the program elements required by section 182(d)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act. As a result, EPA is proposing to approve this submittal.   Nothing in this proposed rule should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.   SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action.

It required cigarette packages to warn that: ""The Surgeon General Has  Determined That Cigarette Smoking May Be Dangerous To Your Health."" In 1970,  the warning was made more definitive. The Federal Trade Commission issued  companion rules regulating cigarette advertising.    Despite these unambiguous and omnipresent health warnings, Dewey chose to smoke  in lieu of a more puritanical existence. He never protested that the pleasures  he derived from cigarettes were not worth their health risks, and thus lacked  any legitimate cause for complaint.    His widow, nevertheless, sued tobacco companies for damages on behalf of  herself and her husband's estate. Resting on state tort law, the complaint  charged the defendants with negligence in failing to adequately warn smokers of  health hazards, and with strict liability for defectively designing cigarettes.    Addressing the first claim, the New Jersey Supreme Court parted company with  contrary holdings by five federal appellate courts and its sister state court  in Minnesota. This galaxy of wisdom had concluded that the federal Cigarette  Act preempted state law damage claims based on inadequate warnings.

Further, it ignores commercial reality to insist that the second purpose would  be undisturbed by acrophobic state liability risks based on inadequate  labeling.

The New Jersey Supreme Court, nevertheless, held that cigarette companies could  be liable for damages by failing to volunteer more warnings than federal law  stipulated. It also concluded that state law would make cigarette companies  liable for injuries caused by smoking if a jury determines that a different  cigarette design might have reduced health risks without impairing consumer  utility.    But a design defect claim is a euphemism for vigilante justice. How do tobacco  companies prove the utility of smoking? Do they call smokers to testify to the  sensual, psychological or emotional benefits derived from cigarettes? How does  a jury assign them a dollar value? Is the average utility to smokers the  pertinent calculation, or the utility to deceased smokers whose deaths  precipitated the lawsuits? How do manufacturers prove that altering the  ingredients of cigarettes to reduce health risks would reduce consumer  pleasures? Must they conduct expensive marketing experiments and user surveys?

The European Court rejected its appeal against Brussels' decision in mid-1991 to allow the Portuguese government to give Ecu547m (Pounds 432m) to the Ford/VW venture in Setubal, south of Lisbon. The court said the Commission had done all that was required of it in investigating the case under Community rules on state aid. About three-quarters of the aid is money which Portugal received from the Commission in EC development funds. VW and Ford are teaming up to build luxury, family-oriented vans that will rival Matra's Renault Espace model. Such vans, which can carry up to seven people, are seen as one of the main growth markets in the motor sector. Matra argued that a tie-up between VW and Ford was not needed for either to penetrate the market niche and that consumers would gain nothing from an alliance that risked damaging competition.

The joint 10-year project commits the government to sharing with Detroit technology, which originated with defence and space research. General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler, in turn, have agreed to co-operate with Washington, and one another, in adapting the technology to civilian uses, developing advanced manufacturing techniques, and producing prototype vehicles. The long-term goal is to make affordable cars that will travel three times as far on a gallon of fuel than at present. Among the technologies on offer by the government are strong, light-weight materials and electrical storage devices developed in the 1980s for the 'Star Wars' missile defence system. On the table from the space programme are advanced fuel cells, which produce electricity by combining oxygen and gas. An inter-agency task force will oversee the initiative, with the private-sector effort co-ordinated by the carmakers' existing research consortium, known as Uscar.

To introduce a new type of confined space entry program into a shipyard facility which already has a workable program seems ludicrous. Two programs would only confuse the employee. By extending the current program, employees will be protected and will immediately recognize the program.            OSHA has concluded that the requirements contained in revised Subpart B are necessary for the protection of employees exposed to hazardous atmospheres in shipyards, regardless of the type of work being performed. Hazardous atmospheres can be found in shipbuilding, as well as in shipbreaking and ship repair. The work practices implemented by employees working in vessels and vessel sections should be the same from one job to the next. The atmospheric hazards will basically be the same and the employees move from job to job within the entire shipyard, so the work practices should be consistent. Using one set of work procedures for atmospheric hazards in a shipbuilding job and another for the same hazards for a ship repair job would serve to confuse the employee and could easily lead to accidents. Therefore, revised Subpart B applies to shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and ship repair.     A short time after the November 1988 publication of the proposed rule on Explosive and Other Dangerous Atmospheres in Vessel and Vessel Sections, the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) was established. SESAC was chartered to provide OSHA with guidance in revising, consolidating, and modernizing the varying sets of regulations that were being applied in the shipyard industry into what is ultimately intended to be a truly vertical standard for all shipyard employment. Shipyard employers would be required to comply with a single set of occupational safety and health standards as opposed to a mixture of shipyard and general industry standards. Consequently, the newly developed shipyard employment standards would apply to all shipyard employment regardless of the type of work being performed (for example, vessel repair or fabrication of railroad cars) or location (for example, in the traditional shipyard or ``up river'' or on sea trials). As a step towards this goal, SESAC recommended that the scope of the proposed Subpart B be expanded beyond vessels and vessel sections, to cover all land-side confined space and hazardous atmosphere situations (Tr. 101, 4/25/90).     In order for OSHA to include SESAC's recommendations into the rulemaking record and to consider fully comments submitted to the docket concerning the general industry confined spaces proposal, OSHA reopened the record on Subpart B (57 FR 28152, June 24, 1992). The Agency raised a number of questions in the notice reopening the record. The most significant issue that underlines a number of the specific questions is rooted in the unique concept of confined space entry that has been the accepted practice in the shipyard industry for over 25 years (36 FR 10466, May 29, 1971). The fundamental basis of OSHA's shipyard standard has been a reliance on preventing employees from ever being exposed to confined space atmospheric hazards. This has been accomplished by the built-in system of testing and ventilating that has become industry practice and has been very successful at preventing confine and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres accidents.     The concept of a single standard, Subpart B, for all shipyard employment was unanimously endorsed by SESAC as well as supported by all of the commenters who addressed this issue in the June 1992, notice (Ex. 113, 114, 115, 116, 118, 1110, 1113, 1114, 1115, 1116, 1118, 1119, 1120, 1121, 1124, 1126, 1129, 1131, 1133, 1134, 1135, 1139, 1141, 1148, 1150). For example, the National Fire Protection Association (Ex. 1119), a voluntary membership organization dedicated to the protection of people and property from fire and related hazards, set out this position as follows:            NFPA favors the development of a single standard which provides for safety during entry and work in confined spaces within the shipyard.         * * * * *         In general, application of two distinctly different standards for vessels and [land-side] operations would be a burden on the industry and would be confusing to employees. Specific points are as follows:     First, *** employees in the shipyard are familiar with the dangers of all confined spaces, not just those confined spaces associated with tanks aboard ships. This has occurred due to the absence of prior safety requirements for general industry.     The shipyards have already adapted the practices and procedures derived from the vessel requirements and applied them to the [land-side], as appropriate.                "," FR940725-0-00131   FR940725-0-00019        * * * * *         The alternative to the expansion of the scope of this subpart appears to be the institution of a different program for [shore-side] confined spaces. To introduce a new type of confined space entry program into a shipyard facility which already has a workable program seems ludicrous. Two programs would only confuse the employee. By extending the current program, employees will be protected and will immediately recognize the program.            OSHA has concluded that the requirements contained in revised Subpart B are necessary for the protection of employees exposed to hazardous atmospheres in shipyards, regardless of the type of work being performed. Hazardous atmospheres can be found in shipbuilding, as well as in shipbreaking and ship repair. The work practices implemented by employees working in vessels and vessel sections should be the same from one job to the next. The atmospheric hazards will basically be the same and the employees move from job to job within the entire shipyard, so the work practices should be consistent. Using one set of work procedures for atmospheric hazards in a shipbuilding job and another for the same hazards for a ship repair job would serve to confuse the employee and could easily lead to accidents. Therefore, revised Subpart B applies to shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and ship repair.

Unions called the 24-hour strike in opposition to plans by Volkswagen, SEAT's owner, to stop producing vehicles at the Barcelona factory. Company officials confirmed that all their production facilities - in Zona Franca, Pamplona, Martorell and El Prat - were paralysed by the walkout. The unions also called on workers at SEAT dealers and suppliers to stop work, but it was not immediately known how widely that call had been heeded. VW purchased SEAT from the Spanish government in 1986, but has seen its subsidiary's sales decline sharply. Sales plunged 19 per cent in the first 10 months of this year. Losses are expected to reach Pta100bn (Dollars 763m) this year. The company has said it wants parts suppliers to convert the Zona Franca plant into an industrial park. It is not clear how many suppliers will accept that invitation nor how many jobs would be saved if they did.   Companies:-  Sociedad Espanula de Automoviles de Turismo.

Government pressure in the early 1980s to buy French and a tax system which heavily favours domestic products leads 80 per cent of French companies to buy only French vehicles. In the leasing market, the proportion reaches 95 per cent. The comparable UK figure is about 4 per cent. As for European Union rules governing state purchases, most French state organisations contacted expressed little interest in even considering foreign products. As the French appear to view free trade as distinctly one-dimensional and EU rules as there to be ignored, just how far should we go in pandering to the attempted blackmail of France's protectionist demands in the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations? Incidentally, am I alone in being unable to recall vigorous French protests at the jobs to be created by that wicked American cultural import (sic) of Euro Disney?

Mr RC Bhargava, Maruti managing director, said the Maruti Y-2, a four-door hatchback with a one litre engine, would be be unveiled after trial production begins in April. Maruti plans to manufacture about 70,000 of the cars a year by the end of 1994 and about 50,000 will be for export, Mr Bhargava said. The rest will be sold locally. 'Europe will be the right market for this car,' Mr Bhargava said, adding it would be fuel-efficient and meet European emission standards. The Y-2 would replace Maruti's 800cc model currently sold in Hungary, Italy, Poland and Portugal. Mr Bhargava said he expected the Y-2 to compete against Fiat, Peugeot and Renault compacts. Maruti exported 23,000 of its 800cc model, the largest selling car in India, in the year to March 1992.

Knowing the magnitude and  complexity of the problem, the laws will be welcomed by all  those who have been demanding more stringent punishment for drug  traffickers and their minions. While doubts may be entertained  about how effective a deterrent the death penalty will be, the  provision relating to the confiscation of assets will surely be  seen as a potent measure because it is bound to have some  chastening effect on those criminals who may not be unduly  averse to the idea of being sent to prison for a year or two but  who would certainly be deterred by the thought of losing their  considerable fortunes as a punishment for their drugs-related  crimes. Doubt will nevertheless persist about the ultimate  effectiveness of these laws if they are no enforced in the same  spirit in which they have been enacted.    In deterring crime the awareness of the inexorability of the  course of law is far more important than the severity of  punishment. This is especially true in this country where most  laws are rendered impotent by a combination of corruption and  slothful enforcement. Unfortunately, this is even more true in  the case of drug-related offences in which the culprits very  often are influential people or enjoy powerful patronage through  sheer money-power and influence. The drug barons, who have  powerful links and lobbies, can dodge the law without much  difficulty. Therefore, what is of the utmost importance is the  will to strictly enforce these laws. Only the certainty of  being caught, tried and punished can instill the necessary fear  in the hearts of the offenders.    The need for a sustained and determined drive to eradicate  the drug menace is all too apparent. Over two million of  Pakistan's citizens, including women and youth, are victims of  heroin and other deadly drugs; the country's image and  reputation are being tarnished in foreign lands as a producer,  processor and supplier of different kinds of narcotic drugs.  The new and reinforced laws should give the government the  punch and power it needs to get at the purveyors of poison,  bring them to justice and break the back of their  well-entrenched operational networks. But the enforcers will  have to be careful to ensure that the powers are not applied  only against the pedlars and other small-time operators because  they can be apprehended more easily than the big fish who really  control them. If the drug barons, whose identities are not  unknown to the authorities, are allowed to go scot-free either  because of negligence or legal lacunae, the purpose of enacting  stringent laws would be frustrated.    The government would also do well to consider integrating  the  different laws, said to number about a dozen, under which drug-  related offenders can be apprehended and punished, into one  comprehensive and forceful law that would eliminate the  possibility of any offender, however influential and powerful,  evading arrest and punishment. Drug enforcement officials would  welcome such a law in place of the several which now guide their  activities and which only add to the confusion and hinder  enforcement. Of equal importance is the need to keep a strict  watch on the activities and modus operandi of the various groups  involved in the deadly trade--drug barons, carriers and pushers.  They are well-organised, have at their disposal huge wealth,  are spurred by enormous profits from relatively small  investments and have powerful links and patronage; to facilitate  their work; they cannot be restrained merely by enacting laws,  however strict. A totally different approach, backed by  scientific methods of detection, trailing, intelligence  gathering, surveillance and so on and, above all, by an  indomitable will to succeed, is what it takes to win a decisive  battle against the scourge of drugs.

Ford, the US's second-biggest motor manufacturer, said that failure in such a significant area of trade 'raises questions about Japan's seriousness' in opening its markets. It added that it would press the administration to monitor how Japanese companies operate in future in both the Japanese and US car markets, and called for a presidential commission to 'recommend further action'. Like other US manufacturers, Ford claims that some structural aspects of the Japanese car market act as hidden barriers to importers. For instance, the fact that Japanese manufacturers have financial stakes in many dealers makes it difficult for foreign manufacturers to find dealers to take on their products, Ford said. Mr Andrew Card, American Automobile Manufacturers Association president, added: 'No agreement with Japan can be meaningful without addressing the auto and auto parts sector.'

The pact is the fifth such agreement on a strategic alliance signed by Taipei, Mr Yang Shih Chien, Taiwan's vice-economics minister, said at a news conference at the weekend. Taiwan's car market has been growing because of the booming economy, with domestic car and truck production totalling 420,000 in 1992 compared with 390,000 in 1991. General Motors has a five-year agreement with Taiwan's Chinese Automobile Co (CAC), announced earlier, under which CAC assembles Opel-Astra sedans on behalf of GM for Taiwan's domestic market. Production started last month and monthly output is between 800 and 1,000 cars. This will jump to 2,000 in early 1994, CAC said.

White-collar unions at Ford are due to meet the management next Tuesday to discuss the situation following a ballot vote in support of industrial action by the company's staff. But a union official said yesterday that his members were 'chomping at the bit' to strike over the compulsory redundancy issue. Last week Ford backed down and agreed not to press ahead with any compulsory redundancies among its blue-collar labour force as a result of improved demand and adjustments to production targets. But to the anger of staff, the company has so far refused to withdraw the threat of compulsory redundancies for its white-collar employees. Management pointed out yesterday it had announced last December that it wanted 2,200 staff jobs to go by the end of this month and it is now only 157 short of that figure. The company said it hoped to achieve the cut in white-collar staff it required without any need for compulsory redundancies.   Companies:-  Ford Motor.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The draft legislation, which is open to further amendment until March, removes the disadvantages which car leasing companies - which account for about 800,000 of the 2.4m company cars on the road - have suffered when leasing to private individuals and VAT-exempt companies, such as banks and building societies, which are unable to recover the VAT they pay. If the leasing companies are allowed to recover the 17.5 per cent VAT private individuals and financial sector customers will no longer be forced to pay 'VAT on VAT' - both on the vehicle purchase and the lease company's charges. Accountants and organisations involved with the leasing industry, such as the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association and the Finance and Leasing Association say, however, that the legislation will give an advantage to the leasing sector compared with the outright purchase of vehicles by companies.

That is no problem'. He added that he would like to meet Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, 'as soon as possible so that we can get to know each other'. The interview was quickly seized upon by Swedish media as a potentially significant overture from Saab that could bring the two Swedish manufacturers closer together.

It ignores, though, the now oft-documented stress and ill health their long working hours produce. Without actually saying so, the article hints that Europe's social provisions (particularly good wages and moderate working hours), should be sacrificed in the name of increased competitiveness. This attitude is increasingly souring relations with Britain's European neighbours, who rightly feel social justice and economic prosperity go hand in hand and resent the attempt of the UK government to create a competitive labour market on the basis of low wages and poor working conditions. There should be no suggestion that Europeans should go back on their social achievements.

0,FT942-14197 ,"FT942-14197 _AN-EDUD3AEFFT 940421   FT  21 APR 94 / Arts: Sunset Boulevard revised - Theatre      By ALASTAIR MACAULAY   Is Andrew Lloyd Webber's new version of Sunset Boulevard superior to his original? Is cyanide more effective than arsenic? If you gotta go, you gotta go. This way is quicker and more intense. The main difference now is that Betty Buckley plays the diva role, the bygone star Norma Desmond. She brings it more energy and more bite; and she wears umpteen suitably repulsive over-the-top outfits, turbans, and wigs. Patti LuPone, who launched the role here last year, seemed to have - Spiderwoman-like - more belief in Norma's own self-myth, and her vibrato was less tremulous; but she had fewer frocks to wear. LuPone, whose voice opens so powerfully at its top and can swell a phrase, reminded us that Lloyd Webber seemed to have composed the role for Barbara Streisand; Buckley, whose face has been made up like a staring pale mask, reminds us that he revised Norma for Glenn Close (in Los Angeles) - in her hammy, lethal, Dangerous Liaisons mode. This exercise in compare-and-contrast, with its wealth of dull detail, is not a task that can interest intelligent adults. The most curious thing is that Lloyd Webber had to revise Sunset Boulevard at all. Though he is crass and corny as a composer of popular music drama, he is terrific as an inventor of blockbuster tourist attractions - usually. His canniness in finding the right theatrical formulas for his era, and in marketing them, is mightily impressive - usually. Like Eurodisney, however, Sunset Boulevard was not doing good enough business. Hence revisions. But oh] revise it altogether. Lloyd Webber's tinkerings cannot disguise the ghastly unoriginality of his mind. Other composers borrow material, but they make something personal from their borrowings. Lloyd Webber, however, simply presses musical feel-good triggers in your mind. His scores have no intention of doing anything new. He means simply to remind you subconsciously of ways you have enjoyed yourself before. If, alas, you become conscious of this, his method becomes eminently resistible. The title song here harps on a phrase and a rhythm that are crucial to a Piaf song, 'La Foule'; the central phrase of 'The Greatest Star of All' uses material that works better in either the Warsaw Concerto or Rachmaninov (I wish I could remember which); and the 'Let's Have Lunch' number is merely a Sondheim pastiche. And as you get to hear each of these a zillion times during the course of Sunset, you cannot miss how little he makes of them. In the original movie Sunset Boulevard you cannot miss how, when Joe escapes from Norma to write scripts (and fall in love) with Betty, he is escaping from a mausoleum to a world of spontaneity. Not so here. Betty's milieu is as musically repetitious as Norma's. More so, in fact. At least Norma's New Year's Eve party breaks out of a tango into a waltz; Betty's stays stuck in a tango. More important, in the movie, you cannot miss the appalling moral collapse of Joe, as he falls reluctantly into Norma's power. Yet here he is little better than a gigolo. Superficially, John Barrowman is an improvement on the musical's previous Joes - especially in his virile, all-American looks (a mix of Tom Cruise, Christopher Reeve, and Montgomery Clift.) But just look how smoothly he enters into Norma's clutches; he actually dances the tango, which should be too dated for Joe, with considerably more flair than she. And he sounds and acts not like an individual but like a formula. This is the worst staging I have ever seen by Trevor Nunn. Why does Norma roam around constantly during her first number? And Joe during the title song? Why are the lines of spoken dialogue paced with such predictable rhythm?

Mr Eckart Ramthun, recently hired from Daimler-Benz, left 'by mutual agreement', Audi said. However, he appeared to be the latest victim of relentless pressure within the group for a rapid return to profit. Audi, formerly run by Mr Ferdinand Piech until he was installed as group chairman in January, is believed to be heading for a substantial loss this year. Its sales in western Europe slumped 26 per cent between January and the end of September, compared with falls of less than 20 per cent for Mercedes-Benz and BMW. The overall car market is down around 16 per cent, while total VW group deliveries have dropped 22 per cent. Mr Ramthun was brought in by Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, a former regional sales executive for Mercedes, who was chosen by Mr Piech as his successor at the group's hitherto most successful subsidiary. Mr Ramthun's departure follows the recent resignation of Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, chairman of the group's Spanish subsidiary, Seat, amid an internal storm over looming Seat losses of DM1.25bn (Pounds 508m) this year.

The DM1bn (Dollars 600m) order from Burlington Northern Railroad, one of the biggest rail freight carriers in the US, was the largest single investment in the history of US railways, Siemens said. The lead contractor will be General Motors' locomotive division, EMD, which will build the engines in factories in Illinois and Ontario, Canada. The Stuttgart-based group will earn around DM170m, excluding income from licences granted to EMD, from the supply of three-phase alternating current motors. The first eight 4,500 horsepower locomotives will be delivered this year and the rest of the order will be completed by the end of 1997. Compared with the direct current diesel-electric motors commonly used in the US, Siemens said its power units were cheaper to run and maintain. General Motors is recalling 1.8m pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, equivalent to about 50 per cent of the vehicles' production, to correct a transmission fluid problem, Reuter reports from Detroit.

Sales fell 12 per cent in the first six months of the current year to just under DM39bn (Dollars 22.6bn), he added, and would reach DM80bn 'with a little luck' in the full 12 months, compared with DM85.4bn in 1992. Deliveries of vehicles had also fallen 12 per cent at the half-way mark to 1.63m units, Mr Schmidt said. The increased strength of the US dollar would have a positive effect, although because of a sharp fall in US deliveries, the Volkswagen of America subsidiary would again suffer heavy losses. Last year, when group profits plunged 87 per cent to DM142m, the US business lost DM100m. Seat, the Spanish business, was also heading for a further deficit after losing DM180m in 1992, Mr Schmidt said. VW has repeatedly stated that it expected to return to profit in the third quarter of this year and break-even overall, in spite of a DM1.25bn loss in the first quarter. The group has implemented job cuts and other cost-cutting and improved efficiency measures.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT942-14502 ,"FT942-14502 _AN-EDTEFADCFT 940420   FT  20 APR 94 / Arts: Sunset Boulevard revised - Theatre      By ALASTAIR MACAULAY   Is Andrew Lloyd Webber's new version of Sunset Boulevard superior to his original? Is cyanide more effective than arsenic? If you gotta go, you gotta go. This way is quicker and more intense. The main difference now is that Betty Buckley plays the diva role, the bygone star Norma Desmond. She brings it more energy and more bite; and she wears umpteen suitably repulsive over-the-top outfits, turbans, and wigs. Patti LuPone, who launched the role here last year, seemed to have - Spiderwoman-like - more belief in Norma's own self-myth, and her vibrato was less tremulous; but she had fewer frocks to wear. LuPone, whose voice opens so powerfully at its top and can swell a phrase, reminded us that Lloyd Webber seemed to have composed the role for Barbara Streisand; Buckley, whose face has been made up like a staring pale mask, reminds us that he revised Norma for Glenn Close (in Los Angeles) - in her hammy, lethal, Dangerous Liaisons mode. This exercise in compare-and-contrast, with its wealth of dull detail, is not a task that can interest intelligent adults. The most curious thing is that Lloyd Webber had to revise Sunset Boulevard at all. Though he is crass and corny as a composer of popular music drama, he is terrific as an inventor of blockbuster tourist attractions - usually. His canniness in finding the right theatrical formulas for his era, and in marketing them, is mightily impressive - usually. Like Eurodisney, however, Sunset Boulevard was not doing good enough business. Hence revisions. But oh] revise it altogether. Lloyd Webber's tinkerings cannot disguise the ghastly unoriginality of his mind. Other composers borrow material, but they make something personal from their borrowings. Lloyd Webber, however, simply presses musical feel-good triggers in your mind. His scores have no intention of doing anything new. He means simply to remind you subconsciously of ways you have enjoyed yourself before. If, alas, you become conscious of this, his method becomes eminently resistible. The title song here harps on a phrase and a rhythm that are crucial to a Piaf song, 'La Foule'; the central phrase of 'The Greatest Star of All' uses material that works better in either the Warsaw Concerto or Rachmaninov (I wish I could remember which); and the 'Let's Have Lunch' number is merely a Sondheim pastiche. And as you get to hear each of these a zillion times during the course of Sunset, you cannot miss how little he makes of them. In the original movie Sunset Boulevard you cannot miss how, when Joe escapes from Norma to write scripts (and fall in love) with Betty, he is escaping from a mausoleum to a world of spontaneity. Not so here. Betty's milieu is as musically repetitious as Norma's. More so, in fact. At least Norma's New Year's Eve party breaks out of a tango into a waltz; Betty's stays stuck in a tango. More important, in the movie, you cannot miss the appalling moral collapse of Joe, as he falls reluctantly into Norma's power. Yet here he is little better than a gigolo. Superficially, John Barrowman is an improvement on the musical's previous Joes - especially in his virile, all-American looks. (Visually he is a mix of Tom Cruise, Christopher Reeve, and Montgomery Clift.) But just look how smoothly he enters into Norma's clutches; he actually dances the tango, which should be too dated for Joe, with considerably more flair than she. And he sounds and acts not like an individual but like a formula. This is the worst staging I have ever seen by Trevor Nunn. Why does Norma roam around constantly during her first number? And Joe during the title song? Why are the lines of spoken dialogue paced with such predictable rhythm? When Joe and Betty fall in love (1, 'What happened?' 2, 'You did.' 3, they kiss) it sounds like emotion By metronome. At the Adelphi Theatre, WC2.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The government said GM, acting through its Brazilian subsidiary, would join forces with CIADEA, a local car company, which will hold an undisclosed minority stake in the venture. GM quit Argentina 15 years ago as political unrest engulfed the country and the economy began declining. Its return is being hailed as an indication of increasing international confidence in Argentina's economic reforms and proof that badly-needed investments in industry are beginning to appear. The announcement comes as car companies in Brazil and Argentina are increasing integration and co-operation. However, of the region's six volume car makers, only Brazil-based GM and Argentina's CIADEA, which builds Renault cars under licence, had failed to build a cross-border relationship. The new GM-CIADEA trucks will be sold on the local market and exported to Brazil. In addition to the GM investment, CIADEA said it would invest a further Dollars 20m to expand its plant in the city of Cordoba and begin building other GM vehicles under licence for sale in both markets.

Workers' representatives and management will start talks soon to discuss short-time working at the group's German factories for the first quarter of 1994, a spokesman said yesterday. The agenda would include a possible extension of the Christmas and New Year holiday shut-down, he added. He dismissed as speculation reports in a Wolfsburg newspaper that the local factory, the biggest in the group, with some 53,000 employees, would shut down for 47 days next year and that other plants could close for up to 60 days. The only concrete decision taken so far was to stop production for six days at VW's smallest works, a half-finished assembly plant in Mosel, eastern Germany. The VW group, which includes the Volkswagen and Audi marques, Seat in Spain and Skoda in the Czech Republic, cut output 19 per cent in the first six months this year. The group is certain to post a substantial loss for the full year following the recent disclosure of an unexpected deficit of DM1.25bn (Pounds 508m) at its Seat subsidiary.

The conduct of the Public Prosecutor's Office has thereby prevented the employee from giving his views on the contents of the box. Evidently the Public Prosecutor's Office can only base its assessment of the contents of the boxes on information from Adam Opel AG/GM Corporation, which makes it completely one-sided. 3.

The Malaysian department of statistics says the country's total natural rubber production in 1993 was 1.07m tonnes, a drop of 98,000 tonnes, or 8 per cent, from the 1992 figure. Within that smallholder output declined 7 per cent while estate production dropped 12 per cent. Exports of natural rubber also dropped - by 9 per cent to 937,000 tonnes. The decline in tin-in-concentrates production was sharper, by 28 per cent to 10,384 tonnes in 1993. Malaysia's is industrialising fast and commodities are playing a decreasing role in the overall economy. Serious labour shortages and low prices are also forcing people to abandon labour intensive agricultural activities. A surge in car sales in the US is being seen as the main reason for a rally in natural rubber prices which, after several months in the doldrums, reached a five-year high on far eastern markets last week. Traders say tight supply due to prolonged monsoon rains in rubber producing areas has also helped prices.   Countries:-  MYZ  Malaysia, Asia.     USZ  United States of America.

According to Automotive News, the authoritative US weekly, vehicle production in the US has risen by 13 per cent this year to 12.28m from 10.87m in 1993. Vehicle output in Japan has fallen by 2 per cent to 11m from 11.23m in 1993. Production in Japan has fallen for four years in succession because of the domestic recession and declining exports. New vehicle registrations in Japan have shown the first signs of recovery in recent months, but for the full year vehicle output has fallen to the lowest level for 12 years. Japanese vehicle production peaked at 13.49m in 1990 after first overtaking the US in 1980. The new ascendancy of the US as the world's leading vehicle producer owes much to the far-reaching restructuring of the world vehicle industry that has taken place in the past decade. Japanese vehicle producers themselves have contributed greatly to the shifting balance with the transfer of more and more production out of Japan during the past 10 years, first to North America, and more recently to Europe and to south-east Asia.

'We have a right to be sceptical,' Mr David Herman, chairman of GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel, said yesterday. 'It would be a real tour de force' if Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's former procurement chief who is now at VW, had managed to develop a new concept between mid-March, when he left the US, and mid-June when he announced VW's plans. Mr Herman was responding to claims in a letter received from VW in which Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, said the German company did not have any confidential plans or documents about GM's ultra-low-cost factory project. Mr Herman confirmed that he had written to Mr Piech before Mr Lopez's announcement, suggesting that he consider the possible consequences if VW's project were the same as the one developed at GM under Mr Lopez's direction. At the time Mr Herman wrote, German state prosecutors were investigating the US group's complaints that Mr Lopez and colleagues took secret documents with them when they moved to VW.

The move was expected following the company's June agreement with the Swedish government, which will split Procordia into its pharmaceutical and consumer product businesses. It is not linked with the planned merger of the group's car and truck operations with France's Renault. The offer values BCP at SKr11.9bn (Dollars 1.5bn), or SKr47 per share, excluding SKr2.5bn of debt. It is essentially a mopping-up exercise, as Volvo will hold 85.5 per cent of BCP's votes and 73.7 per cent of its capital once Procordia is formally split next month. Volvo's offer consists of three alternatives: One new Volvo share for every six BCP shares. Based on the SKr412 price at which Volvo's shares closed yesterday, this values each BCP share at SKr68.7; SKr47 in cash for each BCP share; Seven shares in the new Procordia, to be renamed Pharmacia, for every 20 BCP shares.

The 9.3 per cent year-on-year jump in unit sales of passenger cars, according to the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association yesterday, compares with a 1.5 per cent upturn in July. Demand was strongest for new subcompact models, to which leading manufacturers have attached competitive price tags. The figures exclude the special category of mini-vehicles with an engine capacity below 660cc, sales of which have been on a rising trend for some months. Analysts said the improvement in the consumer market followed tax rebates provided as part of a government package to stimulate the economy. Sales of all vehicles except minicars and minivans rose 12 per cent, a third successive gain and the first double-digit increase since August 1990. This stemmed in part from an 18.6 per cent leap in truck sales. Many older commercial vehicles are being replaced because of tightened emission and load requirements.

The decision followed a fruitless meeting yesterday between union representatives and Ford managers. The white-collar workers voted to support strike action in ballots held earlier in the month. Mr Jim Thomas, national official with the MSF union, warned: 'We are now on a collision course, and if anyone is made compulsorily redundant further industrial action will be taken.' The disruption at Ford's 21 UK plants, involving foremen, computer operators and salesmen, will coincide with the official launch of the Mondeo replacement for the Sierra. The unions plan to lobby Ford dealers and march from Brentwood, Essex, to Ford's European headquarters nearby at Warley. The company told union officials yesterday it could not meet their demand for a guarantee of no compulsory white-collar redundancies. Managers also disclosed that they had found volunteers for all but 88 of the 2,200 redundancies required, with 101 staff being redeployed or transferred.

0,FT943-8478 ,"FT943-8478 _AN-EHQE6ACMFT 940817   FT  17 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Sparks fly over electric cars  -Battery-operated vehicles may not be as clean as originally thought      By VICTORIA GRIFFITH   While the US automobile industry scrambles to meet 1998 deadlines to put electric vehicles on the market, controversy about the environmental benefits and commercial viability of battery-operated cars is mounting. Circumstances in the US increasingly favour the electric car. Air quality laws in California and Massachusetts now demand that 'zero-emission' vehicles comprise 2 per cent of total sales in the car market by 1998. Electric cars are the only vehicles to meet such standards so far. Other states are considering similar laws. Yet the big three car manufacturers - Ford, Chrysler and General Motors - have complained bitterly during the last few months that a deadline of 1998 is unrealistic and that environmental benefits from the vehicles are ill-defined. Several environmental organisations have concurred. In April, a leaked report by the US Environmental Protection Agency questioned the air quality improvements from battery-operated cars, lending credence to electric car critics. 'Electric vehicles will not have a positive environmental benefit across the country,' says Stephen Burrington, a lawyer with environmental advocacy group the Conservation Law Foundation. Many ecologists complain that the term 'zero-emission' vehicle is wishful thinking when applied to electric cars. The emissions are still there, they argue, whether they emanate from the electric power plant or from the car itself. According to the EPA report, switching to electric vehicles may not always improve air quality as these cars increase electricity consumption. Benefits are, therefore, uneven. Regions relying on 'cleaner' electricity sources, such as nuclear and hydro-electric plants and natural gas, for their energy will probably fare better than regions depending on more traditional power sources such as oil and coal. 'The switch to electric vehicles could be disastrous for a state like Kentucky, which still gets a lot of its electricity from coal,' says Robert Russell, a lawyer for the Conservation Law Foundation. Most people involved in the debate agree that electric car use in California would almost certainly improve air quality there. 'California is an exception, first because it has so many clean energy sources such as wind power, and second because its electricity sources are separated by mountains from the cities which have air quality problems, like Los Angeles,' says Reginald Modlin, Chrysler's manager of environmental energy affairs. There the consensus stops. The EPA and NESCAUM, the north-eastern air quality organisation, believe the north-east of the country, which generates much of its energy through nuclear power, could also benefit from electric vehicles. The car industry disagrees. 'Our studies show that the north-east would not get any improvement in air quality with a switch to electric vehicles,' says Modlin. John Williams, chairman of the US Advanced Battery Consortium at General Motors, also points out that electric cars are less efficient in the north-east than they are in California. 'The cold in the north-east hurts our range,' he explains. 'We can get 70-90 miles in moderate temperatures, but only 30 miles in freezing conditions.' Enthusiasts say that studies questioning environmental benefits assume a lower efficiency than they should for electric cars. 'Old gas-burning cars normally see a dramatic increase in emissions as they get older,' says William Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. 'Electric cars don't see this deterioration. After 100,000 miles of driving, they are pretty much the same as brand new in terms of emissions.' Some environmentalists believe electric vehicle efficiency is over-estimated. 'Getting the energy from the power source to storage, from the storage to the car, is extremely inefficient,' says Burrington. Environmental improvements may largely depend on how strictly emissions from electricity sources are controlled. California's rigid pollution standards mean that it would reap more benefits than other states. In the long run, moreover, it may be easier to limit pollution from the electric plants than from individual cars. Emissions, however, are only part of the overall impact, say environmentalists. 'Even if the sources are cleaner, if electric use increases, it can cause ecological problems,' says Thomas Caffrey, an engineer with the EPA. 'There are other environmental problems involved with sources like hydro-electric and nuclear. Hydro-electric power has been very much criticised lately for what it can do to fish and other water species.' Russell contends, moreover, that the issue cannot be studied on a region-to-region basis. 'Cars are marketed widely and cross state boundaries readily, so we need to look at this on a federal level.' Environmentalists also worry that electric cars will encourage Americans to be complacent about their driving habits. 'What we need is an overall reduction in car use in this country,' says Burrington. Despite the criticism, electric cars seem poised to represent part of the car market by 1998. Car manufacturers say they can meet the state-imposed deadlines, although battery technology cannot yet offer the vehicles at competitive prices. The air-quality boards for California and the north-eastern states say they will forge ahead with plans to encourage electric car use. 'With the smog problems we face in California, we have no choice,' says Sessa. 'We have to look at alternatives like electric vehicles. They may not be perfect, but they're certainly an improvement over what we have.'   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

It is complacent because if you had bothered to read the article, 'A sudden burst of acceleration', adjacent to your editorial you wouldhave noted that one of the sad conclusions of the writer is that the replacement for the Rover 800 will be based on a five-series BMW platform. As a result it is clear that future research and development will be concentrated in Germany, so Rover car production will inevitably become an assembly unit. BMW will concentrate resources in Land Rover since it is clear that it is this aspect of Rover which the German carmaker wants. You are defeatist in suggesting that Britain does not have a viable future in important areas of production. I find this a disturbing conclusion and I would suggest that if, say, General Motors attempted to purchase BMW the whole of Germany would be up in arms and such a proposed sale would never go through. I have purchased Rover cars for the last 10 years; whether I will continue to buy a German Rover is another matter.

VW first showed a 'back to the future' concept study for a new generation Beetle, 'Concept 1' (pictured above), at the Detroit motor show last January to gauge market reaction, particularly in the US. The existing Beetle, the world's best-selling car with output totalling more than 21m, is still assembled in Brazil and Mexico. The Concept 1 was designed by Volkswagen's Californian design studio. The body shape of the new car will be derived from the familiar rounded design of the old Beetle, but mechanically it would be a modern car. It would have a front-mounted engine instead of the classic rear-mounted, air-cooled engine of the old Beetle, and would have modern safety features such as airbags and anti-lock brakes. The Beetle, the original 'people's car' which Volkswagen was founded to build, was designed by the German engineer Mr Ferdinand Porsche in 1934, shortly after Adolf Hitler came to power. Volkswagen said yesterday that the most likely production location for the new Beetle was the VW plant at Puebla, Mexico.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

Some of the heat from that  competition is directed at us, QM Software Co., Ltd., a  developer and manufacturer of computer application equipment  located in Onga-machi, Fukuoka Prefecture. There is no end to  the visits paid to our company by people from other companies  wanting to see the electric vehicle that 31-year-old Eiko Sato  and his staff have been developing.    The reason for these visits has to do with the drive motor  that QM developed in-house. Unlike conventional electric  vehicles, the car which we developed is equipped with an AC  rather than a DC motor. We solved the major problem surrounding  the AC motor which had been weak rotational force. A high degree  of stability is assured now when the electric car is accelerated  or when it starts up a hill, shown by the fact that the car can  travel from 0 to 50 km/hr in 5 seconds.    More Work Needed on Riding Comfort    Sato is the leader of a young staff of researchers. The  staff  has been working on the electric car for the past year and a  half. Other than having installed an AC drive motor once in a  50cc motorcycle, this was the first time to install such a motor  in a car.    Sato and his staff got into this for the fun of it in the  beginning, but no sooner had the research got underway when they  discovered that they were able to produce a cheaper and a 30  percent more energy-efficient electric car than other auto  manufacturers.    With this motor, the battery does not need to be recharged  as  much, which was a complaint often heard about the electric car,  so it is actually quite heartening to think that a product we  made could actually contribute toward the widespread use of the  electric car.    Although the performance of the motor is as good as  anticipated, it is still hard to achieve smooth starting and  stopping when applying the accelerator and brake, so riding  comfort is not yet what it could be.    With No Textbook, Work Done by Trial and Error    Prior to this project, Sato and his staff had been working  on  an industrial robot research project entitled ""Making Machines  Move Faster with Greater Precision.""    An automobile takes ambiguous human commands (analog  signals)  such as pressure on the accelerator, and converts these to  computerized digital signals. This information in turn is  conveyed to the tires to make fine movements.    My role in this has been to make sure we could achieve the  same riding comfort as a gasoline-powered car, and see to it  that human commands (analog signals) can be communicated to the  high-performance motor.    There have been no textbooks available to teach us how to  build the electric car, and there has been very little  information available publicly, so everything we have done has  been by trial and error.    Wanting To Be a Global Player    Sato and others in charge of this project firmly believe  that  the day will come when the electric car is widely used  throughout Japan, which is poor in natural energy resources.  They also envisage a day in the future when our children will  point at the electric car and say that we had a hand in building  that car.    Since we can set the number of rpms at which the control  motor runs based on the distance between the car and on objects  in front of the car as detected by sensors, there is a growing  possibility that sometime in the future we will see a driverless  electric car.    That is why there is so much research being done on  recharging methods. One of the sources of headaches is the  limited number of places where cars can be test driven. We are  getting more confident, however, over the fact that major car  manufacturers have shown a great deal of interest in the  technology we have developed.    Sato and his research staff say that their research has only  just begun. The problem with that, however, is that we are still  just a small company and they cannot hope to suddenly jump up  and become a major global player.     "

The plan, which follows persistent US pressure on Tokyo to improve the market environment for foreign vehicle and parts makers, is aimed at deflecting US criticism of trade barriers to the Japanese market. It is being offered as an alternative to US requests for government-led action to open the country's vehicle market. The plan calls for increased exchanges among vehicle and parts industries worldwide, support for foreign vehicle makers in Japan and better availability to foreign companies of information concerning the Japanese market. The issue of car and parts sales has been particularly thorny, as the sector makes up 60 per cent of the US trade deficit with Japan. Japan has been criticised for providing insufficient information to foreign carmakers and for regulations and business practices which hinder sales of foreign-made parts to the Japanese after-market. Japanese officials have refused to commit themselves to US proposals for government action in the industry, claiming on the grounds that such activity in the private sector would constitute managed trade. The association's plan was timed to precede the government's launch of a programme to open up the country's markets.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

There is only one standard van with a critical sliding velocity below 16.73 kph. Its rollover risk is predicted to decrease 17 percent if its critical sliding velocity were to increase 12 percent.

In April the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked GM to recall the pick-ups, based on a finding that the trucks were 2.4 times more likely to catch fire in fatal side-on collisions than similar trucks built by Ford. GM claims, however, that the pick-ups are safe and reiterated yesterday that it did not intend to recall the trucks. 'It does not affect the NHTSA case in any way, shape or form,' a GM official said. 'This is not a recall. There is absolutely no modification of the vehicle. This separates the customer satisfaction concerns from the technical concerns.'

The companies will no longer produce similar-looking vehicles from common production platforms, but instead use the world platforms of their parent companies. However, they have not confirmed local media reports that Autolatina will be disbanded. Autolatina plans to produce the Fiesta model locally because of the growing Brazilian market for small cars. The company intends to invest Dollars 400m in the venture by the end of next year. Autolatina was formed in 1987 during a period of low production and investment in Brazil's car industry. Recent growth and the opening of Brazil's economy led to the decision to use world platforms, according to company president Mr Pierre-Alain de Smedt. Pressure from VW dealers, reluctant to share the platform for the new Golf model with Ford, also contributed. Mr de Smedt said Ford and VW would have more autonomy within Autolatina but the holding company would continue in areas such as purchasing, administration and legal services. The Brazilian car market has been recovering since 1992 thanks to pacts between the industry and the government, which reduced vehicle taxes.   Companies:-  Ford Motor.     Volkswagen.

0,FT934-16436 ,"FT934-16436 _AN-DJFC5AERFT 931006   FT  06 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Crime and punishment   LAW AND order is one of the themes the Conservative party has chosen to highlight at this year's annual conference in Blackpool. Traditionally, the electorate has seen the Conservatives as the party which is toughest on crime and criminals. But Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, has been skilfully exploiting the government's failure to halt the rise in crime. The prime minister is keen to win back the initiative. Much, therefore, is expected of Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, who will reply to the conference debate on law and order later today. The record he must defend is not impressive. Since 1979 the number of crimes reported has doubled while the clear-up rate, the proportion of crimes solved, has fallen from 41 per cent to 26 per cent. Confidence in the criminal justice system is low, according to the opinion polls. Yet the UK continues to send a higher proportion of the populace to prison than almost any other country in the Council of Europe. The mood among constituency representatives is likely to be in favour of stronger measures to fight crime. Mr Howard may be tempted - like some of his predecessors - to announce high-profile initiatives that appear to address current concerns. Juvenile offenders who are out of parental control can expect harsh words. So can persistent offenders who are undeterred by repeated police cautions when they are caught. Overburdened courts But the home secretary would be wise to recall the fate of earlier nostrums such as the Dangerous Dogs Act and the Aggravated Vehicle Taking Act. The former has added greatly to the burden of the courts, while the latter has done little to stop joy-riding or the death and injury associated with it. The failure of such well-publicised measures further erodes public confidence in the ability of the system to curb crime. It would be much better for Mr Howard to address his bulging in-tray which is full of well-considered plans for reforming the system. At the top of the pile is the report from Sir Patrick Sheehy on police pay and conditions. This contains a plethora of suggestions for rooting out restrictive practices in the police service and improving its performance. The report has produced a ferocious campaign of resistance among the police staff associations, sundering the close relationship the Conservative government has enjoyed with the police since 1979. Ensuring that its main thrust is achieved without forfeiting police goodwill will require all Mr Howard's skill and finesse. Prison service Also needing care and attention is the government's programme for modernising the prison service. The creation of a competitive private sector in prison management offers the prospect of improvements in the prison regime and lower costs for the exchequer. But a sudden surge in prison numbers could lead to overcrowding which would undermine both objectives. The cost of a conference promise to send more convicted criminals to prison and to make their life harsher could be expensive indeed. Finally, Mr Howard must make his mind up on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, where he faces apparently contradictory pressures. On the one hand, he needs to re-establish confidence in a system damaged by a series of miscarriages of justice. That suggests steps that might make it harder for convictions to be obtained. On the other hand, he must deal with concern over the failure of the system to punish those who are palpably guilty. That suggests making convictions easier to obtain. In practice, the chances of conviction are best improved by making miscarriages less likely to happen. Juries that have no confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system will be reluctant to convict. The flow of information upon which crime solving depends also relies on improving the relationship between the police and the public. Low-key measures to achieve these aims may not win conference acclaim, but they offer the best chance of making an impact on crime levels by the next election. Restoring the effectiveness of the criminal justice system requires a long-term strategy rather than quick fixes.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

VW has now admitted as much, though given that the aim always looked optimistic, that is scarcely a surprise. More worrying is the likely weakness of any rebound in the market next year, reinforcing the need for the long-term cost reduction programme started by Mr Piech and Mr Lopez. Their troubles with GM are doubtless absorbing a great deal of management time and may yet cost one, or even both, their jobs. Shareholders can hardly be amused by full-scale police raids on the company. Senior departures - particularly of Mr Piech - would badly hinder the reform effort. Restructuring the high-cost Wolfsburg plant is a complex and difficult task, which will take time and a clear sense of purpose. Yet once the strategy has been laid out the task can be completed by others. Besides, around two-thirds of costs are attributable to suppliers: it is there that the greatest savings can be made easily.

The Beetle, the world's best-selling car, with output totalling more than 71m, is still produced in Mexico and Brazil. It was first sold in the US in 1949. VW is seeking to gauge market reaction, in particular in the US, to its 'back to the future' Beetle concept, and any decision to go into eventual production would be unlikely before the mid-1990s. At the height of its success in the US at the end of the 1960s, VW was selling more than 500,000 cars a year, virtually all Beetles. It was the leading car importer in the US, before the Japanese car industry began its assault in the 1970s and 1980s, but in 1993 sales of VW cars fell to a new low point of only 49,533. The VW Concept 1, has been designed by Volkswagen's Californian design studio opened in 1991. The body shape is derived from the rounded old Beetle design, but mechanically it would be a modern car.

The subsidiary, set up in 1990 to build compact cars so as to compete with imports from Japan and Europe, said it had written to owners warning them of the defect and telling them to take their vehicles back to their dealers for repair. The modification is expected by analysts to cost the company about Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.3m), although Saturn refused to confirm the figure. The problem is thought to be small in comparison with the controversy that has surrounded GM's pick-up trucks with side-mounted fuel tanks, of which more than 4m have been sold. GM, which has offered owners Dollars 1,000 each towards the cost of a new vehicle, continues to deny design faults with the pick-up trucks. Unlike the pick-up truck case, Saturn said it had received no claims for death or injury resulting from the fault, and that it had not been ordered to recall the vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The problem is in the wiring leading from the car's generator. It will be replaced with a fuseable link which will trip in the event of overheating.   Companies:-  Saturn Corp.

The US automaker's specialist small cars division, set up in the late 1980s to compete head-on with Japanese imports, has been running full-tilt in recent months to keep up with demand. Saturn's success in designing and building cars that Americans want to buy (it hasn't turned a profit yet) has now propelled LeFauve up the GM executive ladder. Last week, the 59-year old career GM employee was given responsibility for all of the group's small cars. This gives him charge of the Lansing division, which makes roughly three times as many vehicles as Saturn's 300,000 a year. LeFauve (his nickname was supplied by a mariner grandfather) draws plaudits from analysts for making the Saturn experiment a success. The message he has hammered home all along is that the company will stay small. As he told one interviewer, Saturn 'won't be a huge company, or get too big for its breeches'. Recently, though, LeFauve has been clamouring for more investment to lift the division's production capacity.

Pressure from Tory backbenchers and Labour MPs for a cut in interest rates brought no response from the government during a debate on manufacturing industry. Mr Heseltine vigorously denied Labour charges that the passing of Britain's last volume carmaker into foreign ownership would mark the abandonment of the approach to industrial policy he advocated when bidding for leadership of the Conservative party. While acknowledging that he was in the Far East on a trade mission when the agreement by Rover to sell to BMW was announced, he insisted: 'We did not stand back from it.' Mr Heseltine said Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, saw leading figures in BMW, as a result of which 'assurances were given'. He emphasised that if the deal was agreed, Rover would maintain its UK base with independent manufacturing, design and development facilities.

0,FT944-4458 ,"FT944-4458 _AN-ELHD0ADRFT 941208   FT  08 DEC 94 / Technology: The new road sense - Telematics promises to revolutionise transport      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Government ministers from around the world and about 2,000 expert delegates met in Paris last week to explore the vast implications of transport telematics. Telematics is the pooling of information and telecommunications technology to provide new systems and services. The message after three days of the first world congress on transport telematics is that the technology will: Bring radical change to how cars and trucks are designed and built, with significant safety advances such as automatic collision avoidance; radically change the way cars are used - drivers travelling on 'intelligent' highways may even be denied direct control of the vehicles in which they are travelling, yielding control to roadside computers giving instructions to the car by infra-red beams. Create international networks of these 'intelligent' highways, capable of guiding drivers across continents, around traffic jams and other obstructions to any chosen destination. However, they will also have controversial 'Big Brother' capabilities of continually monitoring the location and speed of entire vehicle populations. Save at least Ecu20bn (Pounds 16.6bn) a year on the cost of congestion, accidents and environmental damage in the European Union alone, according to European Commission estimates. Create vast new markets for the manufacturers and servicers of telematics technology. US expenditure on transport telematics alone is predicted to be nearly Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) by the beginning of the next decade, according to the Commission's forecasts. In Europe, it estimates the EU market to equip cars with telematics technology will be worth Ecu6bn over the next 10 years. 'Intelligent' highways do not necessarily mean more highways. The technology is aimed primarily at adapting existing highway networks and greatly increasing the 'intelligence' of cars to take the best advantage of them. Vehicles will be able to 'talk' to each other and with 'intelligent' highway control and monitoring systems. There will be on-board computers, micro-sensors, satellite positioning, synthetic voice transmission, digital road maps, radio telephones, infra-red and hyper-frequency beacons and detectors. Cars of the next century, for example, should be involved in far fewer accidents, making a big contribution to transport efficiency. Cars will be equipped with ultra-violet or infra-red headlamps for improved night vision. They will have a radar and infra-red based intelligent cruise control system, automatically maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, and use video image processing systems to stop straying between lanes. Should this fail and the car crashes, on-board sensors will automatically report the car's position to traffic controllers via the route guidance system in the dashboard which is in constant communication with a geo-positioning satellite. The car will exchange transmissions with roadside beacons, also using mainly infra-red, receiving information on traffic congestion, with suggested alternative routes for the route guidance system. It will transmit, via the roadside beacons, information about its intended destination to regional control centres. Most of this technology has already been developed under the just-concluded, eight-year Ecu900m-Prometheus collaborative research programme among Europe's car, truck and electronic systems makers. Cost remains a problem - only volume production can reduce the current cost of several thousand dollars of some of the more complex systems. But some others, such as ultra-violet night vision, could be introduced now for Dollars 500 or less. There are other benefits. Not least, while environmentalists may shudder at Commission estimates that transport demand in the EU will double by 2010, they may take comfort in the fact that the more efficient use of highway space promised by the telematics revolution should mean less land will be taken for new highways. With the technology at hand, the question for the world's transport authorities is how best to exploit it. Among examples of what is possible, Philips Electronique of France demonstrated in Paris the latest developments in its satellite-based Carin in-car navigation system, capable of guiding a vehicle across France, through digital maps on a dashboard display. UK-based Racal Messenger showed Talon, a video-based system for automatic reading of vehicle registration plates - a potential boon for police use. Trafficmaster, also from the UK, displayed its portable route guidance and traffic information system. The Pounds 200 unit - plus Pounds 19.50 a month airtime subscription - uses infra-red sensors and a radio unit mounted on motorway bridges and gantries. When sensors detect congestion, the information is radioed back to Trafficmaster's control centre at Milton Keynes and relayed 24 hours a day, to the map and information screens of subscriber units. The system covers all UK motorways. It is the only system in the world operating in 'real time' on such a scale, and adds substance to the contention of the European Commission that the heavy investments in transport telematics research made by European industry and research teams has provided a short-term technical advantage over competitors in North America and Japan. However, the Commission has just finished drafting an action plan for implementing transport telematics in the EU, to be presented shortly to the European Parliament, which warns the advantage is at risk unless the EU as a whole and member states co-ordinate better in key areas. European manufacturers of vehicles and vehicle telematics systems believe that projects such as Prometheus have given the region a technological lead in many key areas. Prometheus, the biggest collaborative motor industry research programme undertaken anywhere in the world, had a spectacular finale in Paris in October, when more than 90 prototype vehicles demonstrated the complete array of telematics technology. But developments are also moving rapidly in North America and Japan. The US Department of Transportation has just announced a 'national automated highway' research programme - a Dollars 200m, seven-year venture with a GM-led consortium to build a demonstration 'intelligent' highway capable of 'convoying' vehicles: roadside sensors would place the vehicle under the control of computers linked to regional control centres. Vehicles would be bunched much more closely together than in normal driving, with the computer system operating brakes and accelerator by remote signal. Such a system would use road space more efficiently. But many at the congress fear such a project may be overambitious. They point to the safety implications and the question of liability in case of accident. It is the belief that such systems lie further into the 21st century that has led Europe to concentrate more on autonomous systems for use in the car which help or warn drivers, rather than wrest control of the car from them. In Japan, drivers are already using route guidance and in-car telematics aids. As Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota's chairman, pointed out at the congress, some 700,000 Japanese motorists have already purchased such systems, 350,000 in the past year. Thus while Europe might have a technological edge and North America the political will to lead, in manufacturing terms, the basis for a new industry once again appears to be emerging first in Japan.  -------------------------------------------------------------                 MOTORING-21ST CENTURY STYLE  ------------------------------------------------------------- VARIABLE MESSAGE DISPLAY            COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM  ------------------------------------------------------------- Warns of congestion and             In-car infra-red or radar accidents ahead, and re-            scans the road ahead, routes where possible.              alerting the driver to Data are collected via              obstacles, suddenly sensors built in roads,             slowing traffic and other video cameras linked to             collision risks.

Mr Lopez moved to Volkswagen of Germany in March as head of production and purchasing. At a press conference after GM's annual meeting in Oklahoma City yesterday, Mr Louis Hughes, executive vice-president for international operations, said the company had 'executed a legal complaint' against Mr Lopez 'for what we believe is the taking of confidential documents'. The complaint was in the hands of German prosecutors, who would decide whether to pursue the charges, Mr Hughes added. In Bonn last night, VW declined to comment. An official said there would be no statement until Monday at the earliest. Shortly after Mr Lopez's surprise departure, he hired six GM employees - three purchasing executives and three buyers - who had worked under him. GM has alleged that Mr Lopez also approached up to 40 more in an effort to lure them to VW. The US group has already filed a legal action in Germany to stop alleged headhunting of staff by Mr Lopez. Mr Lopez's departure from GM was seen as a blow to its efforts to cut car manufacturing costs in North America, where the company has lost Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.70bn) over the past two years.

Neither the bank or the buy-out team would last night provide specific details of the support. The buy-out attempt is being led by Mr Arthur Zammit, managing director of Daf International, based at Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Daf International was responsible for the former UK-Dutch truck manufacturers' overseas sales but the six African companies form part of the Leyland Daf receivership in the UK. The operations employ 1,500 people and are based in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi. They are primarily assemblers of truck kits produced by Leyland Daf's plant in Leyland, Lancashire, for third world countries. Mr Zammit said there were three main aims behind the buy-out: to preserve continuity of operations at the six companies, which predate the Leyland-Daf merger of 1987; to preserve the UK and African work forces; and to maintain distribution networks which, he claims, are 'unique' in Africa. Leyland was once the biggest exporter of trucks and buses to Africa. The Littlewoods home shopping group yesterday boosted Leyland Daf's Birmingham vans operation, also the subject of management buy-out proposals, with a new order for 518 vans worth Pounds 6m.

Honda's imported car sales tripled from a year earlier to 4,569 units and those of Toyota Motor were almost four times higher at 1,339 units, as consumers wanting an imported car increasingly chose a Japanese-badged vehicle. Total sales of imported vehicles for the month were 32 per cent higher at 22,977 units, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association said. Excluding Japanese-badged vehicles, sales rose by a more modest 8.2 per cent. For the fiscal year ended in March, sales of imported cars slipped 0.5 per cent to 190,977 units, with sales of cars with engines over 2,000cc 1.4 per cent higher, and those of smaller vehicles down 3.9 per cent. The big loser in March was Volkswagen, which saw a 31 per cent fall in sales due to a severing of ties with Yanase, the dominant retailer of imported cars. Volkswagen, previously the market leader, finished behind Honda, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Yanase has a new relationship with Opel, while Volkswagen has an agreement with Toyota to use its dealer system and the German company is expanding its own sales network.

0,FT933-4206 ,"FT933-4206 _AN-DIIB8AHAFT 930909   FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (18): Optimism remains despite sharp slowdown - Most car companies assume that economic growth will pick up / Mexico      By DAMIAN FRASER   AFTER steady growth over the past five years, Mexico's car and truck industry is now suffering from the country's sharp economic slowdown. In the five months to May, domestic and export sales reached 445,768; a drop of 3.1 per cent on the same period last year. The market had been expecting growth of at least 5 per cent, after last year's increase of 8.8 per cent, and double-digit growth of previous years. The contraction is largely due to a 22.5 per cent reduction in van and lorry sales as small and large businesses have cut purchases in an environment of low economic growth. Car sales increased by a modest 3 per cent, while exports were flat. The reduction comes just as Mexico's car industry is preparing itself for the North American Free Trade Agreement, scheduled to come into force by January 1 1994. The treaty is likely to intensify the integration of Mexico's car industry with those of the US and Canada, enabling car companies to rationalise plants in the Americas, concentrating production in the most efficient factories in the region. Under Nafta, Mexico will gradually dismantle barriers to imports, breaking the complex link between permitted imports into Mexico and a car company's exports and domestic sales. But the US will eventually eliminate its 25 per cent tariff on light trucks, its 2.5 per cent tariff on Mexican cars, and consider Mexican cars as North American for purposes of CAFE, a regulation that encourages car makers to make fuel-efficient vehicles in the US or Canada. On one level, the removal of Mexican trade barriers means that US car companies will likely take advantage of economies of scale in US plants, and excess capacity, by exporting from the US to Mexico. New US exports to Mexico could hurt Volkswagen and Nissan which between them control the compact and sub-compact market in Mexico. GM reckons that as a result of greater US exports to Mexico, the US automotive deficit with Mexico of about Dollars 2bn a year will turn to a surplus. In June, General Motors gave a possible signal of events to come when it announced it was going to move production of US and Canadian-bound Cavaliers from Ramos Arizpe to Lansing, Michigan. But Mexico's low wages, special status under Nafta, and the high productivity of its workers make it an attractive location for new plants. GM has said it might start production of a compact car in its Ramos Arzipe factory, and Mercedes-Benz is exploring the possibility of exporting luxury cars to the US from Mexico. Volkswagen has no factory in the US, and eventually expects to supply part of the US market from Mexican plants rather than, as now, from those in Germany. Other non-US companies, such as Honda and Toyota, may also set up in Mexico to take advantage of its access to the US. Nafta also forces car companies to meet a stiff North American rule of origin requirement of 62.5 per cent. While the US companies easily meet this target, VW and Nissan are having to persuade German and Japanese parts suppliers to set up in Mexico so as to comply. Troubles in the car industry have caused lay-offs and provoke talk of a crisis. On June 15, Ford Mexico fired 680 workers after it cut back production at a plant in northern Mexico City from about 500 to 400 vehicles a day. When announcing the cut-back, Ford said it had been expecting industry domestic sales of 720,000 this year, but it now reckons sales will be about 600,000. The car companies are blaming weak sales on high interest rates, which have cut demand for credit, and the newly privatised banks which, after seeing a rapid increase in underperforming loans, have become much more cautious in giving out loans. The elimination of tax deductibility for company vehicles last year also seems to be having an impact. The worse performing companies have been the US Big Three - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - partly because they are the biggest producers of trucks and vans, and also because they have not recently invested heavily in new capacity. In the first five months, domestic sales at Chrysler fell 24.2 per cent, at GM by 14.6 per cent, and at Ford by 11.4 per cent. Volkswagen, boosted by sales of its new Jetta, improved by 17.1 per cent, and Nissan was up by 4.5 per cent. Exports have held up better, thanks to the recovery of the US economy and increased capacity. Nissan has started exporting from its new Aguascalientes plant, pushing exports up by 80 per cent, while VW exports increased by 18.1 per cent. However Ford, last year the largest exporter, saw exports fall by 13 per cent and has had to eliminate shifts at its Hermosillo export plant, which produces Escorts and Mercurys for the US market. Despite this year's problems, the car companies are still optimistic about prospects in Mexico because most assume that economic growth will pick up from the lucklustre 2.4 per cent of the first quarter this year, and interest rates will continue falling. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts domestic sales will reach 1.1m by 1996 from 706,914 last year. Exports are predicted to rise to 600,000-700,000; almost double last year's figure of 383,374.   Countries:-  MXZ  Mexico.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

Not unrelated, since it governs the prospects for a good lunch and jam tomorrow, is how convincingly the board spells out VW's medium-term earnings outlook. Last year's figures, released last week, showing a DM1.94bn (Pounds 750m) group deficit, 'don't mean anything', according to one invitee. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, is expected to issue a cautious forecast of break-even for this year. But he is likely to wax lyrical on rapidly rising profits thereafter. The board may also clarify the restructuring at Seat, the Spanish subsidiary whose near-collapse has been blamed for last year's earnings slump. VW expects it to be the only one of its marques to remain in the red this year. Although there are hefty doubts about the effects on unit labour costs of the four-day working week currently in effect in Germany, and the overhang of 30,000 surplus employees, analysts appear to have been convinced that new production methods are enough to have turned the tide. Ample portions of asparagus, usual at analysts' meetings traditionally held in May - when the green stuff is in season and cheap - may serve to underpin their belief.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

In two separate agreements, filed in a state court in Texas and in a federal court in Philadelphia, GM said it settled all the outstanding class action lawsuits filed by owners of its 1973-1987 pick-ups. The owners were seeking to be reimbursed for resale value they said they lost because the trucks are allegedly vulnerable to fiery explosions in side-on collisions. In April the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked GM to recall the pick-ups, based on a finding that the trucks were 2.4 times more likely to catch fire in fatal side-on collisions than similar trucks built by Ford. But GM claims the pick-ups are safe and reiterated yesterday that it did not intend to recall the trucks. 'It does not affect the NHTSA case in any way, shape or form,' a GM spokesman said. 'This is not a recall. There is absolutely no modification of the vehicle. This separates the customer satisfaction concerns from the technical concerns.' The Dollars 1,000 certificates are transferable within an immediate family and cannot be sold without the truck.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Volkswagen Financial Services, as the company is to be known, will bring together the number of individual financial services companies that Volkswagen operates and will have direct access to international capital markets. 'The new company will make it much easier to access the most favourable financing rates available on world markets,' Volkswagen said yesterday. 'The result will be a significant reduction of refinancing costs and an improvement in the return on the capital committed to the financial services business.' The group said yesterday the new company would be used to finance the high liquidity requirements of the group's financial services activities. Since the group established a separate financial services division in 1989, the balance sheet size of these activities has grown from DM14bn (Dollars 8.6bn) to DM22bn. Unlike VW's mainstream automobile manufacturing activities, the division is profitable, making DM270m pre-tax profits last year, up from DM120m in 1989. Volkswagen said yesterday profits are set to increase again this year. The new company is to be formed from the merger of financing companies in France, the UK, Italy, Spain and the former Czechoslovakia as well as Germany. Outside Germany the existing companies operate in tandem with the national VW importer.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Volkswagen Financial Services.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT942-5955 ,"FT942-5955 _AN-EFBDVAB5FT 940602   FT  02 JUN 94 / Rover increases output by 26%      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent, and JOHN GRIFFITHS   Rover increased car production by 26 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Overall UK car output was virtually unchanged in the first three months at 362,536, a decline of 0.5 per cent from the corresponding period a year ago. Higher output by Rover, the leading UK vehicle maker and a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, together with the rapid build-up of production by Toyota and Honda at their UK assembly plants, helped to offset declines at Ford and Vauxhall and a sharp fall at Nissan. The rise in Rover output has been driven by the introduction of its Rover 600 executive car range, launched last spring, as well as by rising sales of the Land Rover Discovery and the Rover 200/400. The company recently introduced a Sunday shift to increase output of the 200/400. Production at Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant fell by 45 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter. The company was forced to halve production for nearly four months until early March in order to cut stocks and bring output into line with lower demand in continental Europe. The luxury carmaker Jaguar, a Ford subsidiary, and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a subsidiary of Vickers, are both regaining ground lost during the US and UK recessions. Jaguar, which increased output by 43.5 per cent last year, raised production by 11 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, while the maker of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars - whose sales worldwide more than halved between 1990 and 1992 - raised output 44 per cent in the first three months. Production of commercial vehicles has begun to rise slowly, albeit from a very low level. Output in the first four months was 5 per cent higher than a year before. The two vehicle sectors are experiencing sharply contrasting production fortunes. Car output rose last year by 6.5 per cent to 1.376m, the highest level since 1974, and is forecast to exceed 2m for the first time towards the end of the decade. By contrast, commercial vehicle production fell by 22.2 per cent last year to only 193,414, the lowest level of output since 1948. Rover Cars is halving the dealers' profit margin on its flagship executive car range, the Rover 800, to 5 per cent, John Griffiths writes. The move, which takes immediate effect, brings Rover into line with Vauxhall and Ford, its main rivals in the executive sector, which have introduced similar margins on their respective Omega and Granada/Scorpio executive models. Rover acknowledged yesterday that its action was intended mainly to reduce list prices, making the cars more attractive to company car drivers under the new tax regime. Transaction prices - the amount actually paid for cars - are unlikely to change. Rover said yesterday there were no plans to halve the profit margin on other models.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nissan, Ford and Vauxhall decline sharply  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                1994        1993      1994/93                             Jan-March   Jan-March    % Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS Total                         362,536     364,521        -0.5 Rover (BMW)                   126,209     100,269       +25.9  -cars++                      110,536      87,571       +26.2  -Range Rover/Discovery        15,673      12,698       +23.4 General Motors group           73,668      79,896        -7.8  -Vauxhall                     61,510      69,082       -11.0  -IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)**    12,158      10,814       +12.4 Ford group                     73,045      82,744       -11.7  -Ford                         65,041      75,561       -13.9  -Jaguar                        8,004       7,183       +11.4 Nissan                         38,438      70,058       -45.1 Peugeot                        20,683      20,383        +1.5 Toyota                         18,482       4,808      +284.4 Honda                          10,445       5,199      +100.9 Rolls-Royce (Vickers)             379         263       +44.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMERCIAL VEHICLES Total                          60,357      59,215        +1.9 Ford                           41,106      41,205        -0.2 Rover (BMW)                     6,864       5,158       +33.1  -car-derived vans              1,015         354      +186.7  -Land Rover Defender           5,849       4,804       +21.8 General Motors group            4,886       6,444       -24.2  -Vauxhall                      3,328       3,760       -11.5  -IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)*      1,558       2,684       -42.0 LDV                             2,940       2,755        +6.7 Leyland Trucks                  1,698       1,395       +21.7 Iveco-Ford (Fiat)               1,023         679       +50.7 ERF                               680         562       +21.0 Dennis (Trinity Holdings)         420         329       +27.7 Seddon Atkinson (Fiat)            263         196       +34.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Medium vans sold in Europe variously under Vauxhall, Isuzu, GME and Bedford names. **Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. ++Includes Honda Concerto.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Rover Group.

0,FT933-3839 ,"FT933-3839 _AN-DILAWAB4FT 930911   FT  11 SEP 93 / Gloom behind the glamour: Big car makers are following their customers downmarket      By KEVIN DONE   The motor industry moguls have already checked out of Frankfurt. The circus touches down next in Tokyo in October. Sadly the champagne, the canapes and the elegant hostesses have largely disappeared too - to be replaced by the smell of sweat, stale beer and sausages along the concrete walkways. It is the turn of the customers this weekend to push and crane to ogle the show of shiny metal that the best of the world's motor industry have put on display. More than 900,000 visitors are expected to have elbowed their way through the crush of the endless halls of Frankfurt's biennial motor show, Europe's biggest, by the end of next week. But how many of them will come out and buy? If the industry's wise men are right, 2m-2.5m fewer new cars will leave showrooms across Europe this year, with German sales alone forecast to fall by about 900,000. Four years ago Frankfurt was dominated by green issues and sales were roaring along at record levels. Now every new car has its catalytic convertor, every engine has swapped its carburettor for fuel injection. Recycling strategies are in place. Then two years ago it was safety - and sales were still at a record level. Now everyone has a safety package too, boasting airbags - preferably passenger and driver-side - safety belt pre-tensioners or 'grabbers', anti-submarining seats and reinforced cages for the passenger compartment. So what of 1993? First, the Frankfurt show will be remembered as the moment when Mercedes-Benz and BMW, arguably the world's top two makers of up-market executive and luxury cars, showed the world they were in earnest about diving down to the small car market to try to capture more of Europe's dwindling band of vehicle buyers. BMW's bright-red E1 concept car - a choice of petrol or electric propulsion, a 'greenhouse' roof and about the size of a Ford Fiesta - will not be on the roads for a few years, though it is already being driven inside the showgrounds. In a more restrained shade of metallic blue Mercedes-Benz is unveiling its Vision A 93 small concept car amid floodlights and pounding rock music. Shorter than a Rover Metro or a Renault Clio, with a high roof to allow the engine and gearbox to be located beneath the four-seat passenger compartment, the Vision A 93 is a far cry from Mercedes-Benz's leviathan two-tonne S-Class launched only two years ago. Mr Helmut Werner, who is rapidly emerging as a revol-utionary new chief executive at Mercedes-Benz, is adamant that a small car will be in production by '1997 at the latest'. 'The S-Class was our premium profit producer, but this has changed and we must act accordingly. Our customers are on the move into market segments they have not been in before. They are also buying small cars. We have to be sure we follow our customers.' Frankfurt '93 will be remembered too for aluminium. Audi, the up-market car division of the Volkswagen group, unveiled its near-production concept for a top-of-the-range luxury car with an all-aluminium body. The real thing should be launched next year. 'We have to get away from the spiralling weight of cars,' says Professor Ulrich Seiffert, one of the losers and winners in this year's game of management musical chairs at the top of the embattled VW group. Swept away from the Volkswagen main management board to the VW division by Mr Ferdinand Piech's clean broom at the start of the year, he has just been reinstated as the group's research and development director. 'In the past 10-15 years 150kgs has been added to the average weight of a car. We have to bring the weight spiral down.' And Frankfurt will be remembered for gloom. Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen group, held its Frankfurt party at the city's Rebstockbad, a fancy complex of swimming pools, water chutes and saunas. Traditionally the party is a fiesta, but this year the evening's highlight of a trapeze artist swinging high above the pool with only the water for a safety net was uncomfortably reminiscent of the predicament of most of the European car industry's top executives. With little visible form of support they are swinging above an abyss of mounting losses, job cuts, restructuring and cost-cutting. It was left to the industry's leading showman Mr Bob Lutz, ex-BMW, ex-Ford, and now president of Chrysler to give the show some old-time razzmatazz with the world launch of the US carmaker's all-new Neon small car. At a recent Detroit motor show he launched the group's new Jeep Grand Cherokee sports/utility by driving it up the steps of the main entrance and in through a plate-glass window. This year in Detroit he dropped his Dodge Ram pickup down from the roof. And in Frankfurt? Now with steely grey crew-cut and the look of a US Marines commander, Mr Lutz turned the Chrysler stand and arena into a giant pin-ball machine, so that the stage could flash up the message that the Neon marked the start of a whole 'New Game' in the world small car market. Most of the car industry does not like the current game very much, but at least Mr Lutz could growl with satisfaction: 'Now that was a real launch.'   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

At the same time, thousands of students continued protest actions against the government's decision to impose a freeze on their grants until 1996, instead of increasing them annually by the inflation rate, and to introduce limits on the length of time they can receive public finance for their studies. The action by the engineering workers, members of the IG Metall trade union, was centred on the industrial heartland of North Rhine-Westphalia and north Germany. Among the enterprises which suffered work stoppages were the Ford and Opel car plants in Cologne and Bochum. Both union leaders and the employers expect negotiations on the union's 5.5 per cent pay claim to begin again next week, although the employers remain adamant that real cost cuts must be achieved in the current pay round. The students yesterday won support from the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) in Bonn, which promised to introduce a proposal in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, for grants to be increased after all. Mr Rainer Ortleb, the federal minister of education, resigned his post yesterday on the grounds of ill-health.

Mr John Towers, previously Rover group managing director, has been appointed chief executive. The company said the remaining Rover directors had all been confirmed in their positions. Mr Pischetsrieder said BMW was committed to maintaining Rover as a separately managed British company. Mr Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW research and development director, said in an interview that BMW intended to set up joint committees between the two groups in the key areas of research and development, sales and purchasing. Initially the most intense discussions have taken place over Rover's long-term product plan with key decisions to be taken over a replacement strategy both for Rover's Mini and its 800 executive car. BMW is also preparing for its negotiations with Honda over changes the Japanese carmaker is seeking in the terms and conditions of its various licensing deals with Rover. Mr Reitzle said that BMW was still interested in long-term collaboration with Honda for key components for front-wheel drive cars. 'At BMW we do not have frontwheel drive components, and it would be very expensive for Rover to develop these on its own,' he said.   Companies:-  Rover Group.

As with the President's plan, this proposal requires cash out in such a way to ensure that no employer will have a net loss.      h. Importation of Vehicles Into California_    Little data are available on the population and characterization of 49-state vehicles in California and nationwide. However, it is estimated that out-of-state passenger vehicles (49-state vehicles) currently make up about 10 percent of the VMT in California. As a result of the California's LEV program and the proposed enhanced in-use compliance program, the difference in the emissions level between California certified vehicles and federally certified 49-state vehicles is expected to increase, and 49-state vehicles will therefore have increasing negative impact on air quality. Moreover, if California and 49-state vehicles further diverge in design there may be an increased incentive for California residents to purchase vehicles designed to meet only 49-state standards. Currently, 49-state vehicles with less than 7500 miles of operation (classified as new) may not be brought into California, but older vehicles can be upon payment of a California DMV fee, which is not prohibitive in comparison to many vehicle's market value.  Today's FIP therefore proposes to impose a restriction, starting in 1999, on California residents importing 49-state vehicles. Specifically, EPA proposes to prohibit (with an exception noted below) the State of California from allowing California residents to register for the first time in California any vehicle that was previously registered in another state, unless that vehicle was originally certified to the vehicle requirements set forth in this proposal for its class. In addition, EPA proposes to prohibit California residents from owning and keeping a car in California that is currently registered in another state.  As an exception to this prohibition, EPA proposes that the State of California may allow recent immigrants to California (defined as residents of California for less than three months) to register a car, over 7500 miles, that they had previously registered for at least three months in another state while a resident of that state. EPA's attainment demonstrations are based on migration patterns for out-of-state vehicles that match the restrictions described above. EPA solicits comments on these rules and restrictions.  EPA is also inclined to provide exemptions for historic and collector vehicles, and requests comment on methods for providing these exemptions.      3. Programs for Onroad Heavy Duty Vehicles and Engines          a. Overview_    Heavy-duty mobile sources (trucks and HDVs) are large contributors, especially for NO    X    , to the emissions inventories in the three FIP areas. Existing standards for heavy-duty engines in California are, for the most part, the same as the Federal standards. Further control of these engines is necessary to meet the attainment targets. For these reasons, EPA will propose an enhanced in-use compliance program for heavy-duty vehicles, similar to the one proposed for light duty vehicles, which includes not only tighter standards but also selected controls on higher emitting interstate trucks.  Larger heavy-duty engines see substantially heavier use than smaller engines. These engines are built to very high durability standards and are designed to be cost effectively rebuilt one or more times within their total lifetime. To provide assurance of emissions control over this extended actual life, this proposal includes certification and liability requirements for rebuilt engines as well.       "
0,FT931-14515 ,"FT931-14515 _AN-DARCMACVFT 930118   FT  18 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen   It is hard to read the political signals coming from the meeting of Volkswagen's supervisory board last week. Advance leaks suggested that substantial cuts in the expensive German workforce were on the way, particularly at the main Wolfsburg plant. Yet there was only a modest reduction in VW's capital investment plans and a vague commitment to job cuts worldwide. The most plausible interpretation is that the hard-headed new chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, ran into opposition from the unions and Lower Saxony government, both strongly represented on the board. The company still intends to invest an average of DM9bn a year in the main vehicles business for the next five years, while in 1993 and 1994 VW's cash inflow is unlikely to exceed DM6bn. Even VW's balance sheet will look less solid after such capital spending. And while work on the new Mosel plant is being slowed, that must be set against a possible contraction in the German car market of 20 per cent this year. Nor will job cuts in cheaper manufacturing locations offset the high price of German production. While the shares bounced after the meeting, Mr Piech's leadership will eventually be judged by his ability to cut Wolfsburg's costs, freeing up the cash flow needed for the ambitious international expansion plans. His determination is not in doubt. The will of his opponents has yet to be tested.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT931-11823 ,"FT931-11823 _AN-DBACCADAFT 930201   FT  01 FEB 93 / Saab cars to get big capital injection      By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES      STOCKHOLM   SAAB Automobile is to receive a SKr2.8bn (Pounds 254m) capital infusion from its two owners, Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, as part of a three-pronged drive to restore the group to profitability. Combined with rationalisation and the launch of the group's new model later this year, the injection is meant to turn round the group's fortunes after four consecutive years of losses. The funds are to be used for current operations and to assist in developing future car models. The money will be put into the company during 1993 with GM and Saab-Scania contributing SKr1.4bn each. In mid-1991 the joint owners ploughed SKr3bn into Saab, and the car group received an additional SKr2.5bn subordinated loan from Saab-Scania. When it first emerged that a new injection was being planned last November, Saab-Scania president Mr Lars Kylberg indicated it would be the last support the company would receive. Saab suffered a SKr1.3bn loss in the first nine months of 1992, and is expecting a full year deficit of more than SKr2bn. It has warned it faces an uphill task to return to profitability this year. Crucial to its prospects will be the success of its new model - a replacement for the 900 series - which until now has been kept closely under wraps. It is also carrying out a cost-cutting programme which will cut more than 20 per cent of its workforce, to save SKr2bn.   Companies:-  Saab Automobile.   Countries:-  SEZ  Sweden, West Europe.

Now named as head of public affairs at Volkswagen, Wachs has formally taken over the role of Lutz Schilling, the ill-fated former group spokesman. Schilling carries the can for the public relations catastrophes incurred in the fumbled defence of both the group and production director Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, against accusations from rival carmaker Adam Opel. It was Schilling who sat at the side of Ferdinand Piech during the gruesome summer press conference in Wolfsburg, at which the VW chairman's bellicosity earned him public reproaches from Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Now Schilling will occupy himself with less strenuous matters, such as corporate identity and motor sports. His toughest immediate task will be steering next year's VW sponsorship of a European tour by the rock band, Pink Floyd. Wachs is former press chief for the VW car marque. His snappy dress and a penchant for Italian wine bars - both rarities in VW country - have earned him the soubriquet 'the Wolfsburg yuppie' in some quarters. But Wachs is one of the few old-guard VW senior managers to survive and be promoted by Piech. Moreover, during the recent lull in the Opel-Lopez affair he has guided his fractious boss through a series of image-restoring interviews.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

US car and light truck sales rose 8.4 per cent in the final three months of 1993 compared with the same period of 1992, and the higher volume has allowed carmakers to run their plants closer to capacity and reduce the costly rebates used to sell vehicles during the downturn of the past few years. The most interesting part of GM's results will be how much the company has managed to turn around its bloated North American operations, which lost Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11.30bn) between 1990 and 1992. The mean Wall Street forecast is for GM to earn around Dollars 1.02 a share, according to IBES, the securities information service. The company has set itself a target of at least breaking even in North America in 1993 before interest, tax and other special charges. Ford has made big gains in market share in North America over the past year, helped by strong-selling vehicles, such as the Explorer, and the recently relaunched, sporty Mustang. Its European operations, which have suffered severely from recession in Britain, are also on the mend, and the company recently forecast a return to profits in Europe in 1994. Wall Street's mean expectation is earnings of Dollars 1.13 a share.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Ford Motor.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, Matra-Hachette chairman, said the group was actively considering investment in Renault, with which it already has a joint venture to produce the Espace luxury van. 'It's clear that the government sees us as an interesting investor,' said Mr Lagardere at the shareholders' meeting of Lagardere Group, through which his family controls Matra-Hachette. 'If Renault's management is favourable we would be interested in participating in its privatisation.' Matra-Hachette's interest comes at a time of intense speculation about a merger between Renault and Volvo of Sweden. The French government is thought to be trying to assemble a group of noyaux durs, or long-term strategic investors, in Renault as a precursor to privatisation and to the merger. The government has called on companies to act as noyaux durs for all the privatisation candidates, as it did in the mid-1980s state share sales. Societe Generale, the bank, and Alcatel-Alsthom, the electronics group, have already indicated their interest. IFIL, the Italian holding company linked to the Agnelli family, yesterday also expressed its interest. Mr Lagardere said Matra-Hachette might also invest in Aerospatiale, although he saw its flotation as a longer-term prospect. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French premier, has said that Aerospatiale was unlikely to be sold until after 1995.   Companies:-  Matra-Hachette.     Renault.     Aerospatiale.

0,FT941-6391 ,"FT941-6391 _AN-ECBDOACRFT 940302   FT  02 MAR 94 / Rover displaces Ford at top of motor league      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Rover Group, whose sale to BMW of Germany is expected to be approved by British Aerospace shareholders on March 15, was the UK's biggest vehicle maker last year - a status it lost to Ford more than a decade ago. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show Rover as the biggest producer even when Ford's commercial vehicle output is included. However, the US multi-national's production exceeded Rover's by about 2,000 units if the figure for Jaguar, now a Ford subsidiary, is included. The figures, which show that UK car production reached its highest for 20 years, emerged on the day that Ford announced that short-time working had ended at its Transit van plant at Southampton and that output of Escorts from its Halewood plant was being increased. This year Ford should close the gap on Rover, whose output of cars and leisure/utility four-wheel-drive vehicles rose 7.39 per cent last year to 408,804 from 378,797 in 1992. Although Rover's output of vehicles classified as light commercial is confined to some Land Rover models and a few Maestro vans, the 19,940 it produced last year lifted its output to 426,744. This moved it well clear of the 398,858 cars and vans produced by Ford itself, although Jaguar added a further 29,587 units to Ford's tally. Rover has led Ford in car output for some time but until last year Ford's commercial vehicle output kept it ahead. Last year the commercial vehicle industry suffered its worst for output since 1948. Total car output last year continued on its rising trend, up 6.47 per cent to 1,375,524 units, the highest since 1974. This was in spite of lower output at Vauxhall and Peugeot. The main factor in the increase, apart from Rover, was higher output from Nissan's Sunderland plant and the start of production at the Toyota and Honda plants.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VAN OUTPUT DECLINES AS CARS SURGE AHEAD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      1993          1992      1993/92                                   Jan-Dec       Jan-Dec     % Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                           1,375,524     1,291,880        +6.47 Rover (British Aerospace)         408,804       378,797        +7.39  -cars***                         358,280       339,054        +5.67  -Range Rover/Discovery            50,524        39,743       +27.13 Ford group                        301,380       322,946        -6.68  -Ford                            271,793       302,145       -10.05  -Jaguar                           29,587        20,801       +42.24 General Motors group              273,916       319,094       -14.16  -Vauxhall                        232,589       287,884       -19.21  -IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)*         41,327        31,210       +32.42 Nissan                            246,281       179,009       +37.58 Peugeot                            72,902        85,821       -15.06 Toyota                             37,314             -            - Honda                              32,139         1,001            - Rolls-Royce (Vickers)               1,263         1,258        +0.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMERCIAL VEHICLES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                             193,487       248,453       -22.13 Ford                              127,085       119,234        -21.7 General Motors group               20,488        31,129       -34.19  -Vauxhall                         12,216        14,112       -13.44  -IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)**         8,272        17,017       -51.39 Rover (British Aerospace)          19,940        20,864        -4.43  -car-derived vans                  2,572         3,238       -20.57  -Land Rover Defender              17,368        17,828        -2.59 Leyland DAF Vans                    9,269        20,090       -53.87 Iveco-Ford (Fiat)                   5,598         6,443       -13.12 Leyland Trucks                      5,174        12,450       -48.45 ERF                                 2,284         1,904       +19.96 Dennis (Trinity Holdings)           1,370         1,282        +6.87 Seddon Atkinson (Fiat)                738         1,028       -28.72 Volvo Bus                             295           458       -35.59 Renault VI                          166           819       -79.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *   Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. **  Medium and small vans sold in Europe variously under Vauxhall,     Isuzu, GME Bedford and Suzuki names. *** Includes Honda Concerto.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Rover Group.

During the same period, similar crimes were  perpetrated on the Agadez-Arlit road. The unfortunate result of  these latest attacks are as follows: one dead, four seriously  wounded, more than 1 million CFA francs extorted from the  victims, and various goods worth several million CFA francs  stolen. Vehicles were seriously damaged and peaceful citizens  were harassed and humiliated. Taking stock of this situation,  one realizes the numerous crimes perpetrated by the rebels  against the people of Tillabery, Tahoua, and Agadez.    The ignominious acts the rebels are continuously  perpetrating  are in line with the objectives of their rebellion which include  the revival of ethnic hatred in order to divide Niger our  beloved motherland. Though determined to solve this issue  through dialogue, the Government of the Republic of Niger will  not tolerate these deliberate attacks on goods and on the  physical and moral integrity of people. In any case, it will  not accept the antinationalist objective that is being pursued.    The government hereby calls on all patriotic and active  forces of the nation to mobilize themselves so that through  cohesion, efforts, and sacrifices the Niger people, in unity,  will be able to impede and foil the rebels' attempts at  secession.

Sales in the whole of Germany were up 3 per cent, 2 per cent higher than in December. The increase was led by a 14 per cent year-on-year rise in sales of cars and components. Pharmaceuticals sales were up 11 per cent, and home furnishings 9 per cent. There was a 1 per cent drop in sales of food, drink and tobacco, and a 4 per cent fall in textiles, clothing and shoes. Overall economic activity in Germany 'increased noticeably' around the turn of the year, the economics ministry said. The ministry cited growing foreign demand, 'lively' housebuilding and 'further clear progress' in eastern Germany's recovery as factors underlying this resurgence. Russia's industrial output rose 2.3 per cent in February from January, but was 24.1 per cent below the level of a year earlier, the sharpest drop since start of reforms in 1992. Some 4,280 enterprises shut down some or all production last month. Spanish industrial producer prices rose 1.1 per cent in January, compared with a 0.2 per cent rise in December and 0.8 per cent in January 1993.

I/M-Based Recall Program          The I/M aspect of the enhanced in-use compliance program   (also referred to as the I/M-based recall program) proposed today   applies only if a significant portion of vehicles do not meet the   enhanced in-use I/M standards. The enhanced I/M test equipment,   test procedures, and other physical elements of the program will   remain unchanged from that described in Section III.D.2.c. of   this preamble or from any equivalent program adopted by   California. All 1999 and later model year California LDVs, LDTs   and MDVs covered by the enhanced in-use standards described in   Section A.(2) above will be included in this program, regardless   of fuel type. (See section III.D.2.c. of this preamble for a   description of I/M for non-California vehicles.)      Overall, the enhanced in-use I/M program does three things.   First, it implements a more stringent set of I/M emission levels   (hereafter referred to as the enhanced in-use I/M standards).   Second, it creates a maximum fraction of any particular exhaust   emission engine family which can fail the more stringent enhanced   in-use I/M standards without consequence for the manufacturer   (hereafter referred to as the liability threshold). Third, once   the failure rate of the enhanced in-use I/M standards exceeds the   liability threshold, it initiates a selective recall and makes   the vehicle manufacturer liable for the repairs resulting from   subsequent I/M failures. As described above, the purpose of this   program is to encourage manufacturers to place a high design   priority on in-use vehicle performance and ease of repair in   order to ensure that vehicles comply with their certification   standards in-use.      The sequence of events at a typical enhanced I/M test   facility will be as follows. Vehicles brought for testing will   be measured against two sets of standards: the conventional   enhanced   I/M standards described in Section III.D.2.c. of this   preamble and the lower enhanced in-use I/M standards described   below. Unless a significant portion of vehicles in any engine   family have failed the enhanced in-use I/M standards, vehicle   owners will only be required to repair their vehicles if they   fail the conventional enhanced I/M standards. However, the   number of vehicles failing the more stringent enhanced in-use I/M   standards will be tallied. If the percentage of a specific   engine family failing the enhanced in-use I/M standards exceeds   the liability thresholds described below, two events occur.   First, future vehicles of this particular engine family failing   the more stringent enhanced in-use I/M standards now must be   repaired and retested. Second, the manufacturer, and not the   vehicle owner, will be responsible for the repairs for vehicles   still within their statutory useful life which have not obviously   been abused or tampered with in a manner likely to affect   emissions (i.e., an I/M-based selective recall). As described   below, the enhanced in-use   I/M standards are numerically higher   than the enhanced in-use FTP emission levels. Thus, as long as   vehicles are performing close to the standards to which they are   certified, only the conventional enhanced I/M program will apply   and there will be no post-manufacturing consequence for the   manufacturer of the enhanced in-use   I/M program.      The sections below describe the nature of the proposed   enhanced in-use I/M program including testing, enhanced in-use   I/M standards, threshold for manufacturer liability, tracking of   enhanced in-use I/M test results, repair responsibility,   geographic coverage, and other administrative aspects of the   program.         a. Testing.      As discussed in more detail in Section III.D.2.c. of this   preamble, three types of I/M tests will be performed on light-   and medium-duty vehicles. First, exhaust emissions will be   measured using the I/M 240 test. Second, purge and pressure   tests will be performed to establish the evaporative system's   functionality and integrity. Finally, a visual inspection will   be performed to check for missing canisters, catalysts, etc.   which would indicate that obvious tampering or abuse has   occurred. Vehicles with obvious tampering or abuse which fail   the enhanced I/M 240, pressure, or purge tests will require   repair at the owner's expense.     EPA proposes to include post-1998 model year diesel- and   alternative-fueled (CNG and LPG) vehicles in enhanced I/M   testing, as well as gasoline vehicles. Evaporative system checks   would be revised where appropriate for alternative-fueled   vehicles, since some fuel types (e.g., diesel fuel and   pressurized fuels) produce little or no evaporative emissions as   long as their fuel tanks are not ruptured. Diesel-fueled   vehicles are currently exempt from most I/M programs, because   their HC emissions are inherently low and their historical   control of NO    X     emissions has not depended on technologies that   deteriorate significantly over time. Alternative-fueled vehicles   have been exempted because of their low numbers. However, as the   emission standards applicable to post-1998 model year vehicles   will be very stringent regardless of fuel type, EPA is proposing   that every vehicle be tested under the enhanced I/M program,   regardless of fuel type. EPA requests comment on the testing of   diesel- and alternative-fueled vehicles in the proposed enhanced   in-use I/M program.          "," FR940505-1-00215   FR940505-1-00012            4.

A hopeful event in the long struggle against international narcotics traffic is  the decline in Cold War tensions. Why this is so can be seen from the curious  history of attempts at narcotics control.    Fighting narcotics has never been the highest priority in international  relations, even for the United States. International narcotics policy floats on  a sea of great- power relationships and goals. In the last 40 years the most  persistent obstacle to controlling the supply of opium has been the Cold War,  which divided the world into suspicious and hostile camps.

Eighty years ago the United States started the world anti-narcotic movement by  calling for, then chairing, the Shanghai Opium Commission. The commission was  made possible by an unusual coincidence of anti-narcotic sentiment in Britain,  China and the United States. A slightly different mixture of events and timing  and there would have been no meeting. Building on the commission's expression  of concern, the United States next called for and chaired the Hague Opium  Conference. There, the first treaty intended to control narcotics was completed  in 1912. America fulfilled its Hague Treaty obligations by passing the Harrison  Act.    Few governments, even among those who attended these pioneer meetings, shared  America's firm conviction that any non-medical use of narcotics was wrong and  should be strictly prohibited everywhere.    Little progress was made during World War I to add to the nations ratifying the  treaty. After the war ended, several nations, including the United States,  conceived the ingenious idea of putting the Hague Treaty into the Versailles  Treaty. As a result, ratification of the Versailles Treaty required a nation to  enact domestic narcotic controls within 12 months. It was this requirement,  rather than any heroin or opium problem, that was responsible for the British  Dangerous Drugs Act of 1920, so often touted as having ""solved"" a drug problem  by providing heroin by prescription.    In spite of widespread ratification of the Hague Treaty and the assumption of a  narcotics-control oversight role by the League of Nations, consensus remained  elusive. First, the United States refused to join the league. Then, in 1925,  the American delegation walked out of the Geneva Opium Conference convinced  that other nations did not sincerely wish to end the traffic in narcotics. When  the United States finally resumed cooperating in the 1930s, war in China and  then the outbreak of World War II intervened.    Within the first 40 years of attempting to control narcotics, therefore, the  convergence of circumstances that made possible the beginning of the  international movement never reached the success anticipated. Although treaties  were written, bureaucracies established and many meetings held, the  comprehensive control of narcotics was never achieved. Narcotics use fell in  the United States between the two world wars chiefly due to reduction in  demand.    Recognizing that the vicissitudes of international relations are the key to an  effective control of narcotics, the prospect of lowered tensions between the  United States, the Soviet Union and China is the most optimistic combination of  events since the Shanghai gathering in 1909.

Mr Siegfried Richter, president of BMW Japan, said that the company expected to boost annual sales in Japan to 80,000 units in 2000, compared with last year. Mr Richter was encouraged in his optimistic outlook by the greater cost-competitiveness of imported cars and a growing acceptance of foreign-made vehicles by Japanese consumers. The trend was likely to take the foreign share of Japan's car market to more than 15 per cent by the turn of the decade, compared with about 6 per cent now, he said. Efforts by foreign vehicle manufacturers to penetrate the Japanese market are also being stepped up. BMW, for example, plans to increase the number of dealers handling its cars to more than 200 from 153 at present. Foreign car makers have also been introducing attractive low-interest loans. The German car maker expects sales this year to rise 16 per cent to 30,000 units. In the period from January to August sales have risen more than 12 per cent to 18,689. Imported cars saw a 40 per cent rise in the first six months of this year to 137,000 units, according to the Japan Automobile Importers' Association. In August alone, imported cars surged 70 per cent, marking the 10th consecutive monthly rise.   Companies:-  Bayerische Motoren Werke.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

The group's stocks rose DM12.5 to reach DM374 at the official close, but continued climbing in after-market trading, reaching DM377.20 by late afternoon. Dealers said they expected the 20 non-executive directors to re-state their unconditional support for Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, and Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, production director. Both men will attend and present progress reports on restructuring and provide profit forecasts. The market was also encouraged by Wednesday's announcement that a further 3,000 VW jobs in Germany are to be cut by the end of 1994. This was taken as a sign of management determination to reduce costs. By the end of next year the German workforce will have been cut to 100,000. In the medium-term analysts expect a further 20,000 jobs to go. The market is also expecting action to restore confidence in the group's press and public relations activities, which have been shaken by Mr Piech's abortive efforts to counter allegations of industrial espionage against Mr Lopez by his former employer, General Motors. The supervisory board is expected to try to help Mr Piech extricate himself from what he himself called a 'mud-slinging war' with GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel, and return to the business of restoring VW to health.

According to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association, passenger cars suffered a 7 per cent decline in spite of the introduction by several makers of new models in the autumn. Truck sales were down nearly 9 per cent, reflecting the overall weakness in economic activity. Mr Futoh Fujii, vice president of Nissan, noted in an interview last week that the Japanese car industry could face a 'double dip recession'. Such concerns were supported by the weakness of demand in November, which is the peak year-end sales period as it comes before consumers receive their bonuses in December. Failing a November pick-up, car makers will probably have to wait until the spring for the next opportunity for demand to gather pace, a Honda official said. The downturn in the domestic market has come as exports have also been forced lower, largely as a result of the yen's strength and sluggish demand particularly in the European Union. Japanese manufacturers have had to scale back production plans significantly in order to adjust inventories. Mazda had a two-day closure last month, and Nissan will follow suit this month. Honda plans to halt production for four days between this month and next April and to reduce output by about 10,000 units.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

0,FT933-9542 ,"FT933-9542 _AN-DHIDBAD9FT 930809   FT  09 AUG 93 / VW versus the old school      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES   We can let our industrial structure collapse like the English did, and then the Japanese will come here and have us build cars in Germany from mostly prefabricated parts. For that you need a couple of young people, and they will be more than glad to have any kind of a job,' says Mr Ferdinand Piech. The Volkswagen chairman may not be much of a diplomat, but as a visionary he is worth a hearing. It is readily acknowledged that much of German industry is overweight, overmanned and overdue for an overhaul. But is Mr Piech overdoing things? His colleagues in industry goggled enviously last March when he recruited Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, General Motors' star procurement chief, and seven of Mr Lopez's parts-buying 'warriors'. They were shocked when GM was forced to use the courts to stop his attempt to lure another 40 from the buying department at Adam Opel, the GM German subsidiary. And they were struck dumb by what followed. GM's espionage charges were stunning in themselves, and Mr Piech's more recent nationalistic war declarations and charges that GM had conspired to pervert the course of justice deeply disturbed the political and industrial establishment. But the smoke and noise from these fronts have tended to obscure another conflict at ground level, where Mr Lopez's warriors are bludgeoning price cuts out of VW suppliers. Late last week, the VDMA engineering and plant makers' association begged for mercy and a return to 'civilised' ways of doing business. Large industrial customers - especially the motor industry - were using 'extortion' and 'extreme aggression', it said. Parts buyers demanded to be given foundry moulds and construction drawings, saying continuity of supply had to be ensured should the suppliers go bust. Such bully-boy tactics were previously unknown in the co-operative, consensus-oriented world of German commerce. Still, no one - least of all General Motors - can deny the efficacy of the Lopez slimming cure. It made Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, into the most profitable carmaker in Europe when he was based there in the 1980s. And last week the US parent surprised the world with a Dollars 889m second-quarter net profit compared with a Dollars 703m loss a year earlier. Most striking of all was the fall in the deficit in the core north American business, from Dollars 761m to Dollars 95m - all attributed to cost-savings. Mr Lopez and his warriors had been at work in Detroit for just 10 months when they left in March. Success at Opel, however, came when the German economy was expanding. And results in the US were achieved in a no-holds-barred free market that is far more flexible, far more used to implementing harsh hire-and-fire policies, than Germany's vaunted 'social economy'. It is clear from the German engineering association's claims that other companies are now following the Lopez example - put brutally, kicking the man on the next rung down the ladder. Instead of calm consensus, there is a growing atmosphere of every man for himself. Bosch, however, the country's mightiest car parts supplier and a company of the old, more courteous school, believes it can stand above the fray. It says it will follow its own cost-reduction plans at its own pace, and refuse to bow to unreasonable demands. The company's executives suggest privately that an organised front among lesser companies could deny VW its clamour for pound after pound of flesh. Is a new consensus - the rest against VW - possible? The absence of public backing for VW's policies and tactics from industry or the political establishment - although both are anxious for a lasting cure to Germany's economic ills - suggests VW is moving out on a limb. An extraordinary meeting of the company's supervisory board, called unexpectedly on Friday, resulted in an extraordinary display of confidence in the effectiveness and honesty of VW's dream team. But the fact that it was called at all, when most of Germany was away on holiday, demonstrated mounting pressure. Even if Mr Piech pulls off his ambition of returning VW to break-even this year and profit thereafter, it is likely to be partly at the expense of the components industry. All native German automotive companies' basic strategies depend on increased purchasing of parts from abroad, and on moving vehicle production closer to markets and into lower-cost production zones outside Germany. Most, Volkswagen included, see this as the best long-term solution to their difficulties. But VW, the country's biggest carmaker and by definition its biggest components user, by aggressively pursuing its own immediate aims, could damage the close-knit network of component suppliers and the collaborative relationship between German carmakers. In the longer term this could put at risk the home base, on which the whole industry relies to sustain its long-term metamorphosis. Mr Piech explains his ardour with claims that the German industry has only two years - the time before Japan's current voluntary quotas expire - to match up to its arch-competitors' cost structures. But even he accepts he cannot come within striking distance in less than three years. Mr Piech is making a bold gamble. That his more traditionally minded, long-termist colleagues at Mercedes-Benz, BMW and elsewhere have not thrown their weight behind him suggests they still need to be persuaded he is on to a winner. The legal threats confronting Mr Lopez, on whom the VW chairman has staked his reputation, do not improve his chances of success.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     General Motors Corp.     Adam Opel.

Called to the White House were the top executives of the big three US motor companies and dozens of their suppliers. After pep talks from Vice- President Al Gore, Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen and 'Nafta tsar' William Daley - put in charge of lobbying by President Bill Clinton - the executives were bussed to Congress to talk to wavering congressmen about the virtues of the pact. Along the way they were marched to press briefings, where they dutifully reported that they would be hiring new workers if the agreement was passed, but that jobs would be lost if it failed. Mr Robert Eaton, chairman of Chrysler Corporation, said that the Mexican car market would grow by 36 per cent between now and the year 2000. 'We're going to be in that market, I can guarantee you,' he said. 'If Nafta doesn't pass, we'll have to tool those vehicles down there.' Mexico requires motor companies to export two cars for every vehicle imported. This would end under Nafta. US trade officials say American car exports to Mexico would rise from 1,000 to 60,000 in Nafta's first year of operation. But the pact's opponents say US carmakers and their suppliers willl move production facilities to Mexico to take advantage of the cheaper labour.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT931-11531 ,"FT931-11531 _AN-DBCCRAABFT 930203   FT  03 FEB 93 / The mother of all parliaments: Andrew Adonis analyses proposals to reform the way laws are made in the UK      By ANDREW ADONIS   The best cure for admiring the House of Lords, said Walter Bagehot, is to go and look at it. If you have never looked, and harbour admiration for either Lords or Commons, save yourself a trip to Westminster and read the Hansard Society's report on the legislative process*. The report, published yesterday, is a withering critique of the way law is made in Britain, produced by a commission of senior legislators, lawyers and lobbyists chaired by Lord Rippon, the former Tory cabinet minister. It is a tale of obfuscation, lack of consultation, grossly inefficient use of parliamentary time, yet inadequate scrutiny of either the principles or details of legislation. As the case studies in the report testify, the heart of the problem is the government's largely unfettered control over the legislative process. At one extreme, it cites the 1990 Dangerous Dogs Act. A panic measure, now widely regarded as unworkable, to ban pit bull terriers and Japanese tosas passed through all its stages in the Commons in a single sitting, less than a week after publication. In contrast, the 1990 Broadcasting Bill, which reformed the regulatory regime for the independent broadcasting sector, was subject to lengthy consultation before reaching Parliament, and debated for 17 days once there. Yet so faulty was the bill as introduced, and so little had ministers done to take on board prior criticism, it practically had to be rewritten on the floor of both Houses. The government was obliged to table 800 amendments in the Lords alone, many of them at a few days' notice. 'Public anxiety about the current system is great and demand for change is strong,' says the report. Its main recommendations for change fall into three categories: more intelligible drafting; more meaningful consultation; and more rigorous parliamentary scrutiny. However desirable, major statutes will never make good bedtime reading. On the second theme, the commission wavers between wanting improved consultation, and proposing to take the framing of legislation out of the government's hands. It would, for instance, 'welcome more frequent appointment of independent inquiries, including royal commissions'. But what is an 'independent' inquiry? One staffed by 'experts' (who are generally far from independent)? Or one including political opponents of the government, in which case its report - like that of so many royal commissions in the past - will inevitably be the lowest common denominator of its diverse composition? No royal commission in the early 1980s would have got the privatisation ball rolling; nor is one likely to reform the welfare state. It is in the third area, parliamentary scrutiny, that the commission makes particularly valuable recommendations. Two radical proposals are set out: Before being debated, controversial bills should be referred to select committees with the power to take evidence from academics, professional bodies and interest groups. Ministers and whips should not be members. Select committees should conduct inquiries into important bills before they are subject to line-by-line scrutiny by the Commons. If implemented, these proposals would provide far greater opportunities for those affected by bills to make their voice heard, without compromising the government's necessary right of initiative. And by reducing the direct control of ministers over at least part of the parliamentary process, they would make it more difficult for ill-considered bills to reach the statute book. Would the Hansard proposals have made any difference to the poll tax, perhaps the worst product of the legislative process this century? Possibly not, given the size of Lady Thatcher's majority in 1987, and her determination not to change a dot or comma. But under Hansard's plans, MPs would, at least, have had to address the chronic practical difficulties thrown up by the tax. They would also have come face to face with the near universal condemnation of it. It will take a battle royal between the government and Parliament - that is, its own backbenchers and the opposition - to get the Hansard reforms through. But it has happened before. In 1979, immediately after the demise of a Labour government with no overall majority, MPs voted to set up the departmental select committees, which have proved influential of late. They should seize the chance offered by Mr Major's slender majority to establish select committees for legislation too. * Making the Law, Hansard Society, St Philips Building North, Sheffield Street, London WC2A 2EX.

The new plant, the Wan Yuan-GM Automotive Electronic Control Company, will begin production later this year. Initial output will be 300,000 units annually with a target double that within a few years. Local components will gradually increase to about 70 per cent. Kits will be fully imported in the start-up phase. The new product, an electronic control system, will be made to suit a wide range of vehicles with minor adjustment. It will help reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency and engine power. GM officials are concerned at possible initial resistance of Chinese car makers, but hope the authorities eventually will require all cars to be equipped with performance enhancing and emission-control systems. GM is involved in a number of joint ventures in China, including production of a 10-seater van at the Jin Bei plant in north-east China. GM shipped 7,500 US-manufactured vehicles and more than than 1,000 Opel sedans to China in 1993.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Beijing Wan Yuan Corp.

0,FT931-3721 ,"FT931-3721 _AN-DCOCJAAEFT 930315   FT  15 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen   Tomorrow's meeting of Volkswagen's supervisory board will reveal how far the company is prepared to go to catch up speedier rivals. Although VW's consensual style enabled it to grow into the biggest European car manufacturer, it has lately stifled its response to the industry's rapidly-changing dynamics. VW's failure to change out-dated working practices has left it perilously exposed as Europe's car market lurches downwards. Its European sales could fall by 340,000 units this year. VW's new chief executive, Mr Ferdinand Piech, has signalled a fearsome intent to tackle VW's problems head-on. He has been assembling a strong management team, although the last minute failure to appoint Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who was credited with turning round General Motors' European operations, is a big setback. There may be old-guard departures at senior level, but what matters most tomorrow is whether Mr Piech can at last produce a concrete plan for quickly cutting labour costs. Only that will show whether he has persuaded the trade union and regional government officials on VW's board of the need for drastic redundancies. The sense of crisis at VW may be his greatest ally. Unlike many of its rivals, VW's balance sheet is in reasonable shape. German car sales may fall 20 per cent this year, but they would still exceed those of 1990. Having already come to terms with the prospect of a dividend cut, the stock market may be right in anticipating better times ahead.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

EPA has reviewed the extensive list of scheduled measures and has concluded that the plan would reflect RACM but for the omission of an enhanced I/M program. By this NPRM, EPA is proposing to disapprove the plan with respect to the RACM requirement because of this single deficiency. EPA invites comment on whether other RACM exist for the South Coast CO plan.   e.     Attainment demonstration.     As noted, ``Serious'' CO nonattainment areas were required to submit a demonstration that the plan will provide for attainment by December 31, 2000. The SCAQMD conducted an attainment demonstration using both areawide (Urban Airshed Model, or UAM) and hotspot (CAL3QHC) modeling analyses. The two modeling analyses and the selection of the design value (23.4 ppm, recorded in 1988 at the Lynwood monitoring station) are discussed in Chapter 4 and Appendix D of the CO plan. The modeling analyses are consistent with EPA's guidance (Guideline for Modeling Carbon Monoxide from Roadway Intersections, User's Guide to CAL3QHC: A Modeling Methodology for Predicting Pollutant Concentrations near Roadway Intersections, and Guideline for Regulatory Application of the Urban Airshed Model for Areawide Carbon Monoxide). The SCAQMD's modeling analyses predict attainment of the 8-hour CO NAAQS by the year 2000, based upon the control strategies included in the plan.   However, since attainment depends upon large CO emissions reductions (587.4 tons per day) assigned to the enhanced I/M program, which has not yet been adopted by the State, EPA proposes to disapprove the attainment demonstration portion of the plan. In the future, the attainment demonstration could be approved if the State submits approvable enhanced I/M legislative authorization and regulations.   f.     Quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress (RFP).     The CO plan must contain measures which demonstrate RFP toward attainment by the applicable attainment date. Reasonable further progress is defined in section 171(1) of the Act as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the NAAQS by the applicable date.   EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration and control strategy for the area (see Chapter 6 and Appendix C of the CO plan). EPA concludes that the plan would provide for RFP but for the fact that the State legislature has not yet adopted legislation authorizing an enhanced I/M program and California has not submitted implementing regulations for the program. Therefore, EPA proposes to disapprove the RFP provision. Again, however, this defect could be cured by State action to authorize, adopt, and submit an approvable enhanced I/M program.   g.     Adoption of mandatory control measures.     The Act mandates State adoption of four control programs for CO areas such as the South Coast.       (1) Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance (I/M)       Section 187(a)(6) requires implementation of an enhanced I/M program in the nonattainment area's urbanized portions (as defined by the Bureau of Census) with a CO design value greater than 12.7 ppm. EPA's regulations respecting this requirement were issued on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950). The reader should refer to section III.D.2.c. for a detailed discussion of the purpose and components of the enhanced I/M program. As noted, the California State Legislature has to date failed to enact legislation that would authorize such a program. While EPA is not now required to propose a FIP enhanced I/M measure (as discussed in section III.A.1.), the Agency has chosen to do so as part of the FIP attainment demonstrations.       (2) Oxygenated Fuels       Sections 211(m) and 187(b)(3) mandate SIP provisions prohibiting the sale of gasoline during winter months containing less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Increasing the oxygen content of gasoline causes motor vehicle engines to run with leaner overall fuel/air mixture, thereby reducing the amount of CO generated during the combustion process.   California's adopted regulations (California Wintertime Oxygenates Program for the years 19921995, and Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline regulation for the years after 1995) provide for the sale of 1.8 to 2.2 percent oxygenated fuels. On October 30, 1992, the CARB applied for a partial waiver from the 2.7 percent level specified in the Act.   EPA intends in a separate NPRM to propose to conditionally approve the waiver under the provisions of section 211(m)(3)(A), which authorizes the Administrator to waive, in whole or in part, this fuel requirement if the State demonstrates that use of oxygenated gasoline would prevent or interfere with the attainment of a NAAQS or a state or local ambient air quality standard.   CARB's waiver petition argues that an oxygen content above an average of 2.0 percent would interfere with attainment of the California standards for ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter, because the higher oxygenated fuel levels have the potential to increase emissions of NO    X    , which is a precursor to ozone and (in the South Coast) nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter.

The three companies have embarked on several joint RD programmes, which only a few years ago would have been illegal under antitrust laws, in an attempt to gain a competitive edge over Japanese rivals. The patent has been awarded for a new process for producing vehicle components from liquid-moulded composites, which could replace the use of steel in the interior body structure of some vehicles. Mr Don Walkowicz, executive director of the US Council for Automotive Research (Uscar), said the patent was a milestone for the industry's RD effort. 'It clearly demonstrates that domestic auto manufacturers can work together effectively to develop basic technology that will lead to better, more efficient products and enhance the competitiveness of the US industry.' Uscar was formed last year to co-ordinate the carmakers' co-operative RD programmes. The council now has 10 separate RD consortia covering areas such as vehicle composites, advanced battery research, occupant safety, low emissions technologies, vehicle recycling, and computer-aided design and manufacturing. The patent awarded yesterday was granted to Uscar's automotive composites consortium. Mr John Fillion, chairman of the consortium and manager of organic material engineering at Chrysler, said the patented process would help reduce the overall weight of composite components and could improve fuel economy.

ACTION:     Final rule.             SUMMARY:     Today's rule provides emission standards and test procedures for the certification of new natural gas-fueled, and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty engines and vehicles, and motorcycles. The regulations are effective with the 1997 model year, although optional certification prior to the 1997 model year will be available. Today's rule also provides fuel economy test procedures and calculation equations for natural gas-fueled light-duty vehicles and trucks, effective upon publication, to allow these vehicles to be included in a manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE). Finally, today's rule provides procedures for the certification of aftermarket conversion equipment to allow a vehicle or engine to operate completely or in part on a fuel other than the fuel for which it was originally designed and manufactured.         This action is being taken in order to remove the possibility that the absence of such standards could hinder the development of natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas as transportation fuels. These standards are intended to provide a comparable degree of environmental protection to that afforded by the standards applicable to gasoline, diesel and methanol vehicles, and to ensure that aftermarket conversions do not degrade the emissions performance of the vehicles or engines being converted.

The decision followed a fruitless meeting yesterday between union representatives and Ford managers. The white-collar workers voted to support strike action in ballots held earlier in the month. Mr Jim Thomas, national official with the MSF union, warned: 'We are now on a collision course, and if anyone is made compulsorily redundant further industrial action will be taken.' The disruption at Ford's 21 UK plants, involving foremen, computer operators and salesmen, will coincide with the official launch of the Mondeo replacement for the Sierra. The unions plan to lobby Ford dealers and march from Brentwood, Essex, to Ford's European headquarters nearby at Warley. The company told union officials yesterday it could not meet their demand for a guarantee of no compulsory white-collar redundancies. Managers also disclosed that they had found volunteers for all but 88 of the 2,200 redundancies required, with 101 staff being redeployed or transferred. The company added that 'every effort' would be made to achieve the full redundancy target by March 30. If this was not reached, the company told union officials, compulsory redundancies would be imposed on April 16. Ford said the cuts among staff were part of a wider European restructuring programme to make Ford more competitive. They had not been caused by changes in the business cycle.

SUMMARY:     The Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) of the Office of Energy Research, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) hereby announces its interest in receiving applications to support an experimental program in global climate change, i.e., the measurement and analysis of radiation and cloud/radiation effects. This program is being pursued in support of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and supports the goals of the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program. Funding for this effort comes from both the Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and from DOE. In the initial phases of this effort leased Unmanned Aerospace Vehicles (UAV) will be instrumented and flights will be made in conjunction with ARM site activities. These initial missions will emphasize measurement of the vertical flux profile in the troposphere and the use of UAV-based measurements to calibrate satellite derived fluxes. Applications are sought to use the UAV-based data, in conjunction with ARM site and other data, to address key issues in the radiative heating of the atmosphere; for the use, modification, or development of UAV-compatible instruments for such radiation and cloud studies; to support instrument development; and for data analysis which support integration of the UAV-borne instrument data with ARM site and other data.       These efforts are intended to supply information for the global change scientific community and satisfy DoD SERDP goals in Global Environmental Change.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The purpose of the ARM program is to improve the treatment of radiation and clouds in the models used to predict future climate, particularly the General Circulation Models (GCM). (The role of clouds in climate change is the highest science priority in the USGCRP.) The ARM program is one element of a major effort to improve the quality of current models and to support the development of sets of climate models capable of making regional prediction of climate and climate change. The major component of the ARM Program is an experimental testbed for the study of the terrestrial radiation field, properties of clouds, the full life cycle of clouds, and the incorporation of process-level models into climate models. This testbed is called the Clouds and Radiation Testbed (CART). The first ARM CART site began operation in calendar year 1992 with instruments spread over approximately 60,000 square kilometers centered in Lamont, Oklahoma. Sites planned for the Tropical Western Pacific Ocean and the North Slope of Alaska are expected to become operational over the next four years. The present effort supports ARM objectives by providing for instrumentation, collection and analysis of data on ARM relevant phenomena using UAVs as instrument platforms. The desirability of UAVs for this research lies in their potential to remain on station or make long range tracks for extended periods (>48 hrs) and/or to fly at altitudes slightly above the top of the troposphere. These advantages are achieved without concomitant risk to pilot or crew.       The altitudes of interest for the present effort extend from about one thousand feet to the top of the troposphere.

'The supervisory board emphatically rejects the accusation that Mr Lopez and seven colleagues broke their obligations of secrecy to their former employers at Opel and General Motors,' Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the board, told the annual shareholders' meeting. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chief executive, said that the way in which GM had attempted 'to discredit not only the blameless reputation of Mr Lopez and his colleagues, but also the image of the whole VW concern was incomprehensible'. He revealed that the seven former GM employees who followed Mr Lopez to VW had started legal action against the US motor manufacturer. They were demanding that GM refrain from any action affecting their working relationship with VW and that it retract its allegations. That action was supported by both VW and Mr Lopez. Mr Liesen, responding to rumours that Mr Lopez is earning more than Dollars 5m a year, said his salary amounted to 'less than one third of this sum'. He said Mr Lopez was 'of high intelligence and unusually great creativity, who shows ways in which the European automobile industry can survive competition with Japanese and other producers.

The question is whether they are ringing for Ford, the UK automotive industry, or the economy in general. Ford's UK business is clearly in difficulties. The group's market share has slipped from 30 per cent in the mid-1980s to just 22 per cent. But the company's particular problems only partly explain yesterday's announcement. It was also an admission that the UK automotive industry had been expanding at an unsustainable rate. Car sales during the first seven months this year rose an astonishing 14 per cent, far faster than the economy. In August, the most important month of the UK automotive calender, sales growth slowed to only 2.8 per cent, a deceleration likely to be confirmed by September's figures tomorrow. If more discounts are needed to inject life into the market, margins for manufacturers and suppliers will remain tight - hence yesterday's fall in automotive component manufacturers' shares. A deceleration in the UK automotive market is unwelcome when prospects for the retail and housing sectors remain so uncertain. However, any slowdown need not undermine the UK's economic recovery. Ford, with the lowest proportion of overseas sales of any significant UK manufacturer, has been unable to export itself out of trouble. Others should compensate by increasing exports to rapidly recovering continental markets.   Companies:-  Ford Motor.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

GM hopes that the plan, combined with natural attrition, will reduce its white-collar workforce by 8,000, or 10 per cent, before the end of the year. Only salaried employees who have been with the car maker for more than a year are eligible for the plan. The company has already had success with its early retirement programmes for white-collar workers over 50 years old, which have helped reduce the salaried workforce from 91,000 to 76,000. Overall, GM is trying to cut 74,000 white and blue-collar jobs. Toyota, Japan's leading car maker is considering manufacturing pick-up trucks in the US after the collapse of talks with General Motors over a joint venture, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. Toyota said it would start looking at whether to set up its own production facilities in the US after GM rejected proposals for a joint venture to make the Toyota T100 truck. 'Partnership with GM was one of our choices,' it said. Toyota started exporting its T100 truck to the US last autumn, but sales have been restricted by the 25 per cent tariff charged on imports.

The SZC offer to purchase 51 per cent of Poland's former biggest truck producer, which assembled only 820 vehicles at a loss of 135bn zlotys (Dollars 6m) last year, was accepted by the government after two years of desultory talks with Volvo's truck division. SZC agreed to invest 1,000bn zlotys in modernising the plant over the next six years, with funding from bank loans guaranteed by Daimler-Benz. SZC said: 'We want to put together a holding company controlling plants which are able to produce parts and possibly assemble a Mercedes vehicle in Poland when the German company is ready for such a decision.' The SZC move follows a Polish government decision last week to ban imports of used trucks aged over three years. This will make local producers such as SZC more competitive. Last year, SZC reported a 204bn zlotys net profit. It is planning a Warsaw stock market flotation combined with a new share issue to fund further investments in Poland's engineering sector. The new issue will give Mercedes, which kept a low profile during the Jelcz talks, a chance to take an equity stake in SZC.

Britain's diesel car market is the world's fastest-growing although still well short of France. Even so, one car in five sold in Britain this year is likely to be a diesel. As recently as the mid-1980s, though, they were comparative rarities. Most British motorists still thought of them as noisy and gutless oddities run by economy freaks. No company has done more to change the British view of diesel cars than PSA (Peugeot-Citroen). Its Peugeot 205 and 405 and Citroen BX and ZX have for years been consistent best-sellers in the UK. Now, the new Peugeot 306 (made, like the 405, at Ryton, Coventry) and, in a few weeks, the new Citroen Xantia, will boost diesel sales higher still. The Peugeot 306 rides and handles exceptionally well (like the Citroen ZX, with which it shares mechanical bits and pieces). Since its UK launch in the spring, it has been sold only with petrol engines but, last week, I tried its left-hand drive, 1.9-litre 306 diesels in France. The non-turbo, 70 hp version impressed me but I was enchanted by the whispering, 92 hp, turbo-charged and inter-cooled model. It drove with a vigour that would have done credit to a petrol-engined car and was so refined that I simply forgot (as one does with BMW's six-cylinder turbo-diesels, newly-arrived in Britain) that it was a diesel at all. It pulled so strongly from 2,000 rpm upwards that it felt as much a 'one-gear' car as a massive American V8. (Yes, there are still a few with manual boxes). Prices of 306 turbo-diesels start at Pounds 11,475 and non-turbo models, with less luxurious trim, from Pounds 9,345. Coming to Britain in the autumn is a 1.8-litre, petrol-engined automatic. It has the same smooth-changing, ZF transmission as the 405 and is likely to cost about Pounds 750 more than the equivalent manual-gearbox 306. Other 306s in the pipeline include a sporty two-litre, three-door due late in the autumn and, eventually, cabriolets. Sadly, Peugeot has no plans to market a 306 diesel with automatic transmission although Citroen offers a two-pedal ZX diesel without a turbo-charger at Pounds 11,595. An automatic turbo-diesel Peugeot 306 - or, for that matter, Citroen ZX - could be a delightful and easy-to-drive car, very lively yet still capable of 40 mpg-plus (7.06 l/100 km) economy. But the combined extra cost of turbo-charging and automatic transmission - roughly Pounds 1,300 - might price it out of the market. Automatic transmission has not caught on as widely on mainland Europe as it has in the UK. About 10 per cent of all new cars in Britain and 20 per cent in Switzerland are automatics, but only 2 per cent in France and Italy. It is all to do with the Latin temperament and machismo. Latins love shifting gear. Indeed, Italians are said to feel that two-pedal cars are only for the handicapped or people who hate driving. 'They just don't realise our automatics are so enjoyable,' mourned a man from Peugeot. FILLING a car gives many people the same feeling as paying for a supermarket trolley full of groceries. How on earth could it possibly cost so much? So, it might come as a surprise to learn that British pump prices for petrol are among Europe's lowest. According to the Automobile Association, UK motorists in mid-June paid an average 50.61p a litre for unleaded. Leaded super was 54.37p and diesel 50.14p (although all prices were about 3.5p a litre lower at supermarkets). Compare Britain's 50.61p for unleaded with 74.29p in Norway, 71.74p (Sweden), 70.43 (Italy) and 67.53p (Holland). It should make you feel better. Britain's average 50.14p diesel is fairly expensive, though. Diesel is cheaper everywhere except Denmark and Sweden, Italy (once renowned for cheap diesel but where it now costs 56.43p) and Switzerland (where it has always cost more than petrol and is now 57.41p). French diesel at 44.07p a litre (say, Pounds 2 a gallon) compares with unleaded petrol (61.6p a litre or Pounds 2.80 a gallon) and leaded premium (65.68p or almost Pounds 3 a gallon). You can see why the French prefer diesels to petrol cars and avoid cars that are heavy drinkers. Western Europe's cheapest petrol is in Luxembourg: 43.76p a litre unleaded and 51.09p leaded. Diesel is also a good buy in Luxembourg at 37.43p, but is cheaper in Norway at 31.65p, much less than half the price of unleaded petrol. Greece favours diesel car drivers (29.12p a litre against 58.54p for unleaded petrol, 61.89p for leaded) but the best European country in which to tank-up with any fuel has to be Turkey. Diesel at 24.79p a litre is half the British price, while Turkish leaded premium (34.92p) is even cheaper than unleaded (39.22p). If you are thinking of driving a newish car with a catalyser to eastern Europe, the AA warns that unleaded pumps are few and far between in Bulgaria, the Czech and Slovakian republics, Hungary, Poland and Romania. It would be wise to carry a spare can or two of unleaded in the boot. Make sure, though, that the containers are empty until you are over the Channel. Only the contents of a car's tank are allowed by the ferry operators.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.     P5541 Gasoline Service Stations.

GM hopes that the plan, combined with natural attrition, will reduce its white-collar workforce by 8,000, or 10 per cent, before the end of the year. Only salaried employees who have been with the car maker for more than a year are eligible for the plan. The company has already had success with its early retirement programmes for white-collar workers over 50 years old, which have helped reduce the salaried workforce from 91,000 to 76,000. Overall, GM is trying to cut 74,000 white and blue-collar jobs. Toyota, Japan's leading car maker is considering manufacturing pick-up trucks in the US after the collapse of talks with General Motors over a joint venture, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. Toyota said it would start looking at whether to set up its own production facilities in the US after GM rejected proposals for a joint venture to make the Toyota T100 truck. 'Partnership with GM was one of our choices,' it said. Toyota started exporting its T100 truck to the US last autumn, but sales have been restricted by the 25 per cent tariff charged on imports. This led Toyota to consider manufacturing the truck in the US.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Toyota Motor Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.     JPZ  Japan, Asia.

Land Rover's managers believe that the Solihull-based company, whose workforce has increased by 600 to 8,700 over the past few months, is poised to enjoy the best year in its nearly half-century history. If output levels are maintained 1994 production is expected to reach 80,000 units, a 16 per cent rise on the record year of 1990 when 68,621 were built. Production this year at 68,159 was only 0.7 per cent below the 1990 record. Among factors boosting the company's confidence is the expected recovery next year in Continental markets, the launch in North America this spring of the Discovery, the company's biggest-selling model, and the start of sales through 400 Honda dealers in Japan of a Discovery model rebadged as the Honda Crossroads. About two-thirds of output is exported. Weekly production of 1,830 units has required the introduction of a night shift for the first time and compares with weekly output of 1,290 at the start of this year. Discovery output this year jumped 46 per cent to 35,620 from 24,347, helped by UK demand where 1992's total Discovery sales of 19,989 were exceeded in this year's first nine months. Output of the Defender was lower than in 1992 at 17,590 compared with 17,651, as was the Range Rover at 14,949 compared with 15,334. BAe sells offshoot, Page 13   Companies:-  Land Rover.

0,FT931-1379 ,"FT931-1379 _AN-DCYCKADJFT 930325   FT  25 MAR 93 / EC clears Berlin deal with Sony      By ANDREW HILL      BRUSSELS   THE European Commission has decided that the Berlin city authorities did not 'sweeten' unduly a 1991 property deal with Sony, to persuade the Japanese electronics manufacturer to move its European headquarters to a prime city site. The Commission yesterday closed its 15-month inquiry into the DM101m (Pounds 42.7m) deal, by deciding that the Japanese company would not have to pay extra for the site on Potsdamer Platz, which used to be bisected by the Berlin Wall. Brussels has been looking closely at property deals in Berlin, where prices have increased substantially since unification of the city. Companies which are found to have paid less than market value for state-owned properties can be asked to 'repay' what amounts to an illegal state subsidy. Last April, the Commission ordered Daimler-Benz to make an additional DM33.8m payment to the Berlin authorities, on top of the DM93m which it paid in July 1990 for another office site on the Potsdamer Platz. The Commission applied the same reasoning to the Sony sale. Following an independent valuation, Brussels estimated that the 30,900 sq m Sony site was worth between DM128m and DM149.5m. However, it agreed that figure should be adjusted downwards by about DM41.3m to take account of strict conditions imposed by the Berlin authorities. After adjustment, the Commission estimated that the potential state subsidy in the deal was too small to be significant. Daimler-Benz has never pursued its objections to the Commission's decision on its property deal, and is also believed to be happy with the ruling favouring Sony.   Companies:-  Sony Corp.

However, the company only hoped these improvements would translate into better profits, he added. The 1993 annual report, published yesterday, predicted a satisfactory result. Rover, the new UK subsidiary, was likely to produce improved pre-tax earnings, although taxes and BMW's conservative accounting methods would turn this into a loss if the group decided to consolidate the results this year, Mr Doppelfeld added. According to Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman, Rover's prospects were even more interesting than believed at the time of the recent Pounds 800m (Dollars 1.2bn) takeover. He refused to elaborate, but maintained that the fact that Rover would remain an independent business spoke for itself. Mr Pischetsrieder appeared optimistic on the outcome of negotiations to maintain technological links between Rover and Honda. Expectations were high on both sides, he said. Confirming that technical co-operation deals on Rover's mid-range models were to be continued into the next model generation, he said he wanted to forge a long-term relationship with Honda. Group turnover rose to DM7.5bn (Dollars 4.4bn) in the first quarter, although car deliveries to customers were unchanged at 137,000 units. Production fell 7 per cent mainly because of disruption caused by tooling up for two new models. The company, which plans a rights issue to raise about DM800m, is expected to continue to outperform its domestic rivals.   Companies:-  Bayerische Motoren Werke.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT943-173 ,"FT943-173 _AN-EI3DUAEAFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Fiat   Fiat's management should be congratulated for extricating the company so rapidly from the most wretched period in its history. The battered car maker is back in the black far quicker than expected, partly because of the market, but in no small measure, thanks to timely self-help. The lira's devaluation also assisted, aiding exports and making competitors' products more expensive in Italy. The Brazilian experience also augurs well for international sales. The 34 per cent fall in net debt was a pleasant surprise. A further recovery can be expected when the Italian market, representing more than 40 per cent of automotive sales, finally recovers. The management's determined cost cutting has been particularly impressive. In only 12 months, overheads as a percentage of sales have been slashed 2.8 percentage points to 13.6 per cent. Production costs have also been sharply reduced. A new engine plant, and two new assembly plants in southern Italy where Fiat can take advantage of lower wage costs, are both making their mark. Such rationalisation was necessary for Fiat's survival, but the group's success is by no means assured.

The agreement, which frees each company to sell its stake in the other, highlights the growing willingness of Japanese companies to unwind business ties which have outlasted their usefulness. Susuki holds a little over 1 per cent of Isuzu shares and Isuzu just over 2 per cent of Suzuki. Isuzu, which is 37 per cent owned by General Motors of the US, and Suzuki, in which GM has a 3 per cent stake, formed their business and capital link in 1981 with the blessing of GM and in the hope that as fellow members of the American group a tie-up would bring significant benefits. However, the link has only led to a deal in which Suzuki provided Isuzu with vans on an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) basis and one in which Suzuki's commercial vehicles were manufactured at an Isuzu facility in the UK which it jointly owned with GM. The former resulted in just 1,500 vans being made between 1986 and 1988 while the latter led to 72,000 vehicles until last year. Both projects were abandoned after the vehicles proved unpopular. The two companies have had difficulty finding new joint business opportunities and none have been formed since August last year.

The move underlines the extent of the recession affecting the industry, and its difficulty in exporting, given the continuing strength of the yen. The group stopped all overtime for production and office-workers at its Japanese plants during January and February. It has not yet decided whether to continue the ban during March. The company, which reported a 48.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits during the six months to the end of December, has also temporarily shut one of its 17 domestic production lines because of poor demand. The shutdown, at its Motomachi plant in Toyota City, Aichi prefecture, happened late last year. The group intends to reopen the line, which makes mark II passenger cars, in April. Another line, at the Tahara plant in Aichi prefecture, had also been closed. The company has not yet decided when the line, making Celica and Carina EDs, will be reopened. Toyota said its daily production had fallen from a peak of about 17,000 vehicles a day to 13,000. Japanese vehicle production fell 10.2 per cent last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association (Jama). The Japanese automotive industry is gaining little comfort from exports. In January, these recorded their 10th straight month of year-on-year decline. Exports slumped 26.5 per cent compared with the same month in 1993, according to Jama.

The contract, which the company yesterday said is backed by the Taiwanese government and would be worth 'quite a few millions' over several years, may make more difficult a decision by General Motors on whether to sell Lotus. GM has owned Lotus since 1987. Several interested parties have approached GM about the purchase of all or parts of Group Lotus, including a management team led by Mr Adrian Palmer, the managing director. GM has not disclosed details of the other approaches, which followed a decision last year to abandon production of the Elan small sports car after less than two years. Lotus had hoped to sell 3,000 a year but the car was widely regarded as too expensive and never came close to sales targets. As a result Lotus Cars, the carmaking division which now produces only the very low volume Esprit 'supercar', has been making heavy losses for the past two years. It now employs only 200 people - one third of 1991 levels. Lotus Engineering, the consultancy division which has won the Taiwan contract, earned more than Pounds 30m in 1991 and is understood to have made substantial profits last year, although figures have yet to be released. The division is now substantially larger than the carmaking side of the business, with 500 employees.

0,FT931-7855 ,"FT931-7855 _AN-DBVBWAE3FT 930222   FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (19): Risks must fall as costs rise - How customers are reacting to higher insurance rates      By RICHARD LAPPER   HIT BY heavy losses after rapid growth in the late 1980s, motor fleet insurers have increased premium rates and reduced the terms of cover available in the past two years. But the rising cost of insurance is prompting many motor fleet managers to buy less insurance and look to other ways of reducing risks. The cost of insurance - a Pounds 1m-plus item for many of the biggest fleets  -is leading to boardroom interest in risk prevention. 'You were in a situation where premiums were simply chasing claims upwards. It was an expensive funding exercise,' says Mr David Ney, risk management director at Willis Corroon in London, who says buying insurance for its motor fleet is one of the biggest 'insurance spends' for many organisations. While competition among insurers drove premium rates down in the late 1980s, the increased frequency of accidents and escalating court awards to accident victims pushed up the cost of claims. Drivers of company cars are - on average - roughly twice as likely to have accidents as other drivers. Accident frequency rates - which measure the number of accidents as a percentage of insured drivers each year - average between 50 and 70 per cent, compared with a rate of between 20 and 25 per cent for private motorists. Some motor fleets have accident frequency rates as high as 120 per cent, says Mr Ney, who is critical of many company car drivers. 'It is really about attitude awareness. Everyone thinks it is someone else's problem,' says Mr Ney. In line with general trends in the motor insurance market, theft rates have also increased sharply in recent years. Motor fleet premiums are much higher than those for private cars because policyholders do not obtain the benefit of no claims bonus and because cover is more comprehensive. The recent deterioration in losses pushed up rates by an average of about 25 per cent in 1992, after more modest rises in 1990 and 1991. Fleets with particular poor safety records have found themselves paying much steeper increases. Standard excesses - the part of any claim paid by the policyholder - have increased. Two years ago insurers would have charged excesses of Pounds 100 for each accidental damage claim. That amount is now typically Pounds 250, and is charged against claims for fire and theft, as well as accidental damage, says Mr Fred Whitworth, commercial motor manager at Eagle Star. Cover for damage to windscreens is frequently excluded. Insurers are also more likely to introduce restrictions, refusing to pay for the loss of personal effects or stipulating that replacements for stolen stereos must be the manufacturer's model. In addition, many policyholders are prepared to retain a substantial tranche of risks on their own books in exchange for lower premiums or simply buy less cover - fire, third party and theft, for example - for the same premiums. Mr Whitworth says that 17 per cent of Eagle Star policyholders renewing in 1992 'traded down' in this way. At the same time, insurers have become much keener to press policyholders to manage risks in order to reduce claims. Because premium rates reflect claims experience over a three-year period, action taken by policyholders to reduce accidents will eventually results in lower claims. According to Mr Chris Palmer, motor underwriting manager with Zurich Insurance, 'the strategy is to move the debate away from price, towards better service standards to persuade policyholders to take a long-term view'. Increasingly, insurers are pressing motor fleet managers to administer their fleets more tightly, inspecting driving licences more frequently and monitoring the condition of cars more regularly, in order to weed out potential problems. Most fleets are now restricting the number of family members who can drive a company car, in order to reduce the access of younger drivers, typically teenage sons and daughters, who are more prone to have accidents. Insurers are also beginning to press policyholders to select particular kinds of vehicles, especially those which are less prone to theft. Several fleets have stopped buying hot hatches, for example replacing GTI Volkswagens and Astra GTEs with Vauxhall Cavaliers. Insurers are also supplying better quality data to policyholders, making it easier for fleet managers to identify particularly poor or accident prone drivers. 'You've got to supply ammunition to help the statistical departments,' says Mr Palmer. According to Mr David Voss, managing director of Velo, which provides a insurance management service for motor fleets, good information can allow fleet managers to pinpoint which regions and drivers are contributing most to insurance costs and enable them to vary charging within the organisations accordingly. 'Suddenly the local manager, with one eye on his profit-related bonus, may take a different tone with his errant drivers,' says Mr Voss. Although no insurer offers reduced premiums in return for the adoption of risk management measures, one company, Perth-based General Accident is prepared to subsidise the cost of driver improvement programmes for policyholders. GA pays Pounds 40 of the Pounds 75-a-day fee charged by driving instructors for what it calls a 'defensive driving' course. Instructors must be on GA's own approved list. Opinions about the value of the scheme vary. Mr Ney is convinced of its value. 'The problem is frequently the 40-year-olds who work 16-hour days under great stress. You have to knock away the common perceptions. Driver training is a very good way of targeting the issue.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

For  the first time in the history of motor vehicle sport there was a  display of military motor vehicles and technical servicing  facilities, mobile workshops, and heavy traction vehicles with  which the Russian Army is being equipped. Alongside the  well-known two-, three-, and four-axled Mustang-class KamAZ  trucks which won prizes in the 1992 Paris-Dakar Rally, new  vehicles were also on display. They included high all-terrain  capability wheeled and tracked GAZ-47 and GAZ-47-04 vehicles  designed to carry personnel and light arms. It is planned to  equip the mobile forces which are currently being formed with  these vehicles.    Heavy traction vehicles also demonstrated their  capabilities.  They can easily haul a tank or a strategic missile complex from  a battlefield, or out of crater, ravine, or bog. The pride of  our military motor vehicle industry is of course the Vityaz  range of double-unit tracked vehicles with a loading capacity of  10, 20, or 30 tonnes. Marshes, bogs, and quicksands are no  threat to them. They easily cope with muddy roads in spring and  fall and snowdrifts in winter, and are able to float across  rivers and lakes.    [N.A. Zazulin, chief of the Russian Defense Ministry Main  Motor Vehicle Directorate] I can claim with utmost confidence  that the Vityaz, which comes in the 10-, 20-, and 30-tonne  version, is unparalleled in the world.

A total of 30 Impacts will be rotated on a two- to four-week basis among 1,000 participants in 12 regions. Drivers will use the cars in real-life situations so that the company can gather data for the vehicle's eventual sale, set for some time in the late 1990s. Of the 1,000 participants, 300 will be in four California regions: Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay area, GM said. California has the toughest car emission control standards in the US. Beginning in 1998, 2 per cent of cars sold in the state must be zero-emission vehicles. That figure will rise to 5 per cent by 2001 and 10 per cent by 2003. The Impact has a range of 70 miles in the city and 90 miles on the open road at 55mph. According to GM studies, 68 per cent of people drive less than 50 miles a day. The car uses lead-powered batteries, which take between two and three hours to recharge if they are below 80 per cent of capacity. The batteries have to be replaced every two to three years at an estimated cost of between Dollars 2,000 and Dollars 5,000, which is comparable to the maintenance costs of a petrol-powered car over the same period, GM said.

Although most electoral districts still face a second round  and the names of the new Supreme Council deputies will at best  be known 10 April, two conclusions can be drawn now.    The first is that today the republic is to all intents and  purposes split. On the one hand, the western oblasts are the  bastion of Ukrainian ""independence,"" where most voters voted for  Rukh and other ""patriotic"" movements. On the other hand, you  have the east, which leans toward Russia and where candidates  advocating rapprochement with Moscow celebrated their success.  The results of a poll conducted in Donetsk Oblast showed the  mood of inhabitants of the eastern regions today. According to  preliminary figures, 87 percent of the oblast's residents were  in favor of Russian being recognized as the second official  language and 85 percent were in favor of Ukraine fully entering  into an economic union with Russia.    Both these demands are unacceptable to the  ""national-democratic"" parties which won a decisive victory in  the west of the republic. There is a real threat that the future  parliament, torn between two irreconcilable political forces,  will be unviable. Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil stated  unequivocally that he will be unable to find a common language  with former Premier Leonid Kuchma, who is ""entirely  Russia-oriented."" However, it is Kuchma who is deemed the  favorite in the coming presidential elections. He confirmed his  popularity 27 March: In Chernigov Oblast, which borders Russia,  Kuchma's candidacy won the support of over 90 percent of the  voters.    The second conclusion concerns Crimea. Eighty percent of the  peninsula's inhabitants who took part in the poll of the  population answered ""yes"" to two questions that Leonid Kravchuk  has declared unconstitutional. As Kiev feared, the people of  Crimea voted in favor of dual citizenship (Ukrainian and Russia)  and greater autonomy from Ukraine.    The outcome of the ballot not only threatens a fresh crisis  between the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities but may well  affect relations between Moscow and Kiev. [Crimean] President  Yuriy Meshkov is making no secret of his plans: Based on the  will of the people he will demand that the Crimean parliament  adopt the appropriate laws. Aware that Kiev takes an extremely  adverse view of this, the Crimean president is deliberately  heading for a conflict, relying ""on himself, on his  administration, and the help of the Black Sea Fleet.""    For their part Ukrainian radicals are urging Kravchuk to use  force to impose order on the peninsula. And although the  Ukrainian president will hardly take their advice, the threat of  armed confrontation is looming large. Especially if the Black  Sea Fleet responds to Meshkov's appeals and backs him in  violation of the Russo-Ukrainian accords. It is no coincidence  that in a recent television interview Kravchuk spoke of the  possibility of another Karabakh.    Russian diplomats are giving assurances that Moscow's plans  do not include exacerbating the situation in the Crimea. Russia  is primarily interested in Kiev's nuclear disarmament, which may  be suspended if a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity  arises. On the eve of the Crimean poll the Russian authorities  took an emphatically neutral stance, reluctant to interfere in  the sovereign state's domestic affairs. Nevertheless events are  largely developing contrary to Kiev's wishes. No matter how  Yeltsin and Kozyrev urge restraint on Meshkov, the Crimean  president is considerably closer in spirit to other Russian  politicians. It is no coincidence, according to REUTER, that in  one of his interviews he spoke of his enthusiastic view of  Zhirinovskiy.    If the crisis in Ukraine worsens while relative stability at  least is preserved in Russia, separatist aspirations will  receive a fresh boost -- and not just in Crimea. In that case  Moscow may find itself involved against its own wishes in the  maelstrom of events in the neighboring country. And even if  Yeltsin takes a moderate stance, it is unlikely that the Duma,  dominated by communists and nationalists, will resist the  temptation to play the Crimean card and, in the future, the  Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk cards....    A foreign diplomat accredited in Moscow admitted that during  private conversations Russian officials have already begun  testing the water in an endeavor to find out how the West would  regard the dismemberment of Ukraine. At the moment these  hypotheses are no more than that. At any rate Yeltsin's  entourage has no intention of forcing the process. Annexing the  Crimea would not improve the economic situation in Russia and  would hardly strengthen its international position. The Russian  Federation itself has enough trouble spots, is it worth adding  another?    The Kremlin has opted for wait-and-see tactics with regard  to  Ukraine, weighing up all the ""pros"" and ""cons"" and leaving the  Kiev authorities themselves to unravel knots that are growing  tighter by the day.

0,FT931-8065 ,"FT931-8065 _AN-DBUAKAE0FT 930220   FT  20 FEB 93 / Motoring: Citroen's Xantia sets standard for its rivals - This BX replacement is a high-class act      By STUART MARSHALL   THE MONDEO is more than just the car expected to power Ford's recovery; it is the benchmark against which many of the 1993 models will be judged. This thought kept occurring as I tried three examples of Citroen's new Xantia range in Spain last week. Just as the Mondeo goes beyond being a mere Sierra replacement, the Xantia steps up half a class in succeeding the BX. It goes on sale in France early next month, will be available in left-hand drive markets soon afterwards and reaches Britain with right-hand steering in June. To begin with, there will be a choice of three petrol engines - 1.8-litre, 103 horsepower; two-litre, 123 horsepower; and a 16-valve two-litre developing 155 horsepower. Diesels, naturally aspirated and turbo-charged, follow rapidly and will be on sale in Britain well before the L-registrations start in August. So will a 1.6-litre, petrol-engined entry model. The Xantia is as crucial to Citroen in Britain as the Mondeo is to Ford, although for different reasons. Ford believes the Mondeo will restore its fortunes and rebuild market share. Citroen, meanwhile, seemingly cannot put a foot wrong in the UK. Last month, it took more than 6 per cent of the new car market, overhauling Nissan, Renault and Volkswagen-Audi. It also grabbed almost 18 per cent of a record 29,540 diesel car registrations. Ten years ago, the BX was the car that started to change Citroen's image - and build its sales - in Britain. Before the BX, Citroens were bought mainly by enthusiasts loyal to the marque. They had to be; the only sensible price they could get at trade-in time was from a Citroen dealer - against a new Citroen, naturally. The BX changed all that. Although idiosyncratic in styling and suspension (a self-levelling system using high-pressure gas instead of steel springs), it was not quirky. People who had never contemplated owning a Citroen bought a BX and liked it. Soon, it became a mainstream motor car. Its owners are natural buyers of the Xantia, although the new car might appeal also to drivers of Sierras, Cavaliers, Nissan Primeras, Peugeot 405s and Renault 21s looking for a change. The Xantia is a typical new-generation Citroen. Its wheelbase of 108.3in (271cm) is the longest in its class; its lean though rounded styling is distinctive; and it has the unique gas/hydraulic suspension. Inside, there is plenty of room for four full-sized people to stretch out. Rear-seat head and leg room is better than the Mondeo's although boot capacity is the same. The seats, yielding and well-shaped, and the interior appointments generally are closer to those of the big XM than the BX. Most of my driving in the 1.8-litre Xantia was on well-surfaced and almost deserted motorways. It was as comfortable and refined as one expects a car of the Xantia's class to be. At what most business motorists consider a normal cruising speed of 80-85 mph (128-136 kmh), I was aware of the engine spinning at 4,000 rpm-plus, perhaps because wind and road noise were negligible. In a motorway downpour, the air-flow kept the back window completely clear and dry. The two-litre Xantia felt a little more urgent. Lower profile tyres sharpened its steering response, but ride comfort and road noise were affected less than they were on the Mondeo equivalent. Citroen's gas/hydraulic suspension was evolved 40 years ago to give motorists an armchair ride on rough surfaces, and there is still nothing like it for comfort on a neglected D-road. Spain's highways have been transformed in recent years, but there are plenty of fast, uncrowded and ill-maintained minor roads. On their patched and wavy tarmac and acute bends, the Xantia rode serenely. Best of all was the 16-valve model. This had XM-style Hydractive II suspension, which adapts automatically to road surface and driving technique. Even at silly cornering speeds, it prevented body roll. The squat - though not at all noisy or hard-riding - Michelin 55 series tyres, and a small degree of rear wheel steering (like the smaller ZX model's), combined to make it feel exceptional nimble and safe. Equipment levels for the UK market have not been decided, nor has the price. Experience suggests it will cost no more - and probably slightly less - than its class rivals. All Xantias have power-assisted steering with a height-adjustable wheel, remote-controlled central locking and crash protection bars in the doors. Anti-lock brakes are extra on the cheaper models. Airbags (which General Motors announced this week had been made standard on the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra, just pipping the Mondeo at the post) will not be available until 1994. By that time, an estate car probably will have been added to the Xantia range. If the BX is anything to go by, up to 30 per cent of Xantia buyers will chose diesels, especially turbo-diesels, which will have the 1.9-litre engine now used in the ZX. There appears to be enough under-bonnet space for the Xantia to take the 12-valve, 2.1-litre turbo-diesel used in the Citroen XM. A highly-specified 2.1td Xantia with automatic transmission, ABS brakes and air-conditioning is a thought for Citroen to toy with for the mid-1990s.   Companies:-  Automobiles Citroen.

Mr Kortum's removal may also lead to further turmoil in the VW group, already racked by unexpected losses last year of DM2.3bn (Pounds 870m), and striving to reach break-even in 1994. Meanwhile suspicions of theft and industrial espionage in the wake of the appointment of General Motors' former global purchasing chief, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who joined last March, remain. Mr Kortum's first set-to with Mr Piech occurred before his appointment, when he rejected the 'spokesman' role and insisted on taking full control. The conflict leading to his downfall has focused on the autocratic group chairman's demands that Audi, which made a pre-tax loss of more than DM200m in 1993, must be turned round this year. Mr Kortum has frequently appeared unwilling to bend to his chief, who has swept away swathes of the old VW management within his first year. The most recent departure was that of Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, chairman of the Spanish subsidiary, Seat, who was sacked last September.

Even the better practitioners, from Hammett to Simenon to early Le Carre, are often discussed with respectful irony and damned with faint praise. John Harvey's hard-boiled police procedural Wasted Years is genre-busting crime fiction at its best. Harvey is either an important novelist who happens to use this form or, more likely, a very good genre novelist whose wider ambitions stretch this format. Harvey obeys the discrete rules of this generic type - for example, puzzle-setting - but also transcends them. His method is take a character - Charlie Resnick, a morose Nottingham detective inspector - and go along with him into situations that take him to the end of his tether. The plot concerns nearly-forgotten violence which has left some nasty unfinished police business, a spate of armed robberies, and Resnick's broken marriage. In spite of the flashbacks, between 1969, 1981 and the recent past, it is an excellent read, with brisk narrative breezes blowing refreshingly through the twisted recesses of this heart-searching cop's past. Resnick makes Inspector Morse seem jaunty, but then again he has a lot to be despondent about: his personal life consists of watching Notts County football team and listening to jazz records with only four cats for company; his working life has seen an erosion of respect for the law. Resnick cheers himself up by making outstanding sandwiches - not making but building: 'thin slices of Gruyere cheese, slices of smoked ham, halved black olives, onion, several pieces of sun-dried tomato and, finally, some crumblings of blue Stilton on top of two thick slices of light rye bread.' We readers do not need cheering up, however, as this is superb stuff - the book,that is, not the sandwich. Dave Brandstetter's LA patch is far from Harvey's nervy British provincial city. Private dick Brandstetter is the ageing creation of Joseph Hansen, and this is, in fact, the final Brandstetter mystery. But it is still a good enough place to start for new readers, a spare and stylish whodunnit set in sun-drenched, gentrified southern California. Brandstetter is a blond and blue-eyed veteran; a furtive smoker; another gourmet, though not of sandwiches - he even owns a good restaurant; he drinks malt scotch; and is, unusually for a sleuth, homosexual. Hansen's tone is cool and determinedly restrained, the better to evoke Dave's low-key integrity, so much so that a sudden elegiac paragraph about marshland lost to the city seems merely 'literary' guff from an accomplished writer of popular fiction who wants to be taken seriously. This tiny, preening aberration aside, Brandstetter's last case is a fine yarn of drug dealers, failed rock musicians, child abuse and dishonest local politics - especially at only a fiver. The Dangerous Edge is a spy story told by a woman in a field where it is generally gentlemen who prefer Bonds. Why was journalist John Blair shot? Why was he in Spain? Is it anything to do with that old East German agent now hanging round Prague? Search me, chum: ask Lesley Grant-Adamson. This is is a suspenseful, complex book, part thriller, part crime novel, converging on post-Velvet Revolution Prague. More labyrinthine plotting in JK Mayo's A Shred Of Honour. Witty, elegant, humane, Mayo is, like John Harvey, a 'real' writer dressed in genre clothing and making the snobbish distinction redundant. A cache of British chemical-biological-radiological weaponry has been stolen from the Gulf theatre of war and sent into the Nubian desert by forces unknown. As the caravan makes its way through Sudan, crumpled, likeably cynical military intelligence agent Harry Seddall plays his hunches about who did it and why. What is distinctive about Seddall's milieu is that the spies are vital, amusing and brilliant people, completely unlike Le Carres weary bureaucrats. The plot-twists are amazing yet not far-fetched. The book lodges in the memory because of Mayo's objective treatment of ruthlessness. All this plus more sandwiches, though sometimes of the knuckle variety.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT933-4080 ,"FT933-4080 _AN-DIJB0AC8FT 930910   FT  10 SEP 93 / Management: The dangers of a culture crash      By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ   IT is an old trick, played most often in euphemism-loving America, for two companies to describe the takeover of one by the other as 'a merger'. It makes both top managements feel more comfortable about the deal, and for a while mollifies all the other 'stakeholders' concerned. Goliath swallows David, but they tell shareholders, employees, governments and local communities they are 'merging'. A few years down the road the truth becomes all too obvious. Not only has the senior partner swallowed the junior, but frequently it has also destroyed most of the latter's special skills - the very things which helped prompt the acquisition in the first place. From the signs of the past few days, this is all too likely to be the way things turn out once giant Renault and tiny Volvo consummate the 'marriage' which they announced this week. Most French observers certainly expect Renault to dominate. In its main headlines about the deal, the influential newspaper Le Monde toed the official line about 'fusion' (merger), but gave the game away on an inside page with a sub-heading which read starkly: 'L'absorption par Renault'. For Volvo to go the way of so many acquired companies in the past would be a tragedy. This is not just because of its innovative skills in production and international management. Far more important is that this would destroy what could otherwise have been the potential for Renault-Volvo, like ABB (Asea Brown Boveri) before it, to become an entirely new European company, capable through leanness, speed and flexibility, of challenging the toughest competition that either the US or Japan could throw at it. Supporters of Louis Schweitzer, the purportedly internationalist and certainly ambitious head of Renault, will protest that this is exactly his intention. If so, he has already, in several senses, fluffed his first chance. Instead of locating the head office of the new group at Renault's existing HQ in western Paris - with twin offshoots there and in Gothenburg - he should have made the classic move of a 'transformational' leader: broken sharply with the company's past by choosing a fresh site elsewhere. Since national politics make a move to neutral Belgium or the Netherlands impossible, he could at least have moved the HQ to the other side of town. Percy Barnevik, the Swede who heads ABB, took such a step by locating its new HQ in Zurich, a short but significant distance from Brown Boveri's old Baden office. Actions of this kind are far from merely symbolic: they tend to energise management when a company is faced with any kind of radical change. Not for nothing did ATT move out of its pompous Philip Johnson-designed Manhattan skyscraper when it was forced to revitalise itself. The reformist new boss of troubled Digital Equipment has just taken a similar decision to leave the Massachusetts mill where it has been since birth. If Louis Gerstner is well advised in his battle to stop IBM from sinking, he will abandon the company's plush HQ in leafy Armonk. A second immediate step by Schweitzer should have been to declare that the Paris head office will be staffed entirely on merit by a wide range of nationalities, including Swedes, Dutch and Americans. Otherwise, the suspicion must be that it will be dominated by the French. The equivalent worry would apply equally to a Swedish, Dutch, American or British parent company. It is not too late for Schweitzer to make such a move: he could still change course before January, the date by which he has said the details of senior staffing arrangements will be settled. To hold back until after the subsequent privatisation would lose precious time, and also forego (taking) a step towards internationalisation which would make Renault-Volvo more attractive to private investors. Delaying would also provoke more resistance among his French staff. The nationality of key staff is closely linked with the question of what sort of organisational and 'culture change' processes Schweitzer intends to initiate across and down the company. Even if it were not swallowing Volvo, Renault would have had to undergo a wrenching series of such changes as it emerged from the protective arm of the state. Now, the challenge will be all the greater. Rather than 'fusing' the two cultures, as commentators have suggested, his objective must be to create an entirely new culture, as Barnevik has done at ABB. This will undoubtedly require some existing elements from both sides, such as Renault's emphasis on flair and adventure in design and marketing, and Volvo's greater informality and internationalism. Injecting each of these into the other side will be hard enough. But if, as at ABB, Renault and Volvo are to develop quickly the vital unifying sense of building a new world together - which requires much more than just using a newly decreed language (English) - they must also borrow from around the world fresh attitudes, disciplines and procedures. Given the gulf between typical French and Swedish attitudes to such basic management variables as authority, delegation and uncertainty, Schweitzer's task here will be tough indeed. He will find it a little easier if he can bring himself to hold up an Americanised version of Swedish culture - more decisive and entrepreneurial - as a model at which to aim. By no means all of this can be done quickly; creating ABB has so far taken Barnevik five years. But for any of it to succeed, Schweitzer needs to get off on the right foot. In spite of his stumbles this week, he still has time to do so. The best way of doing that would be to behave internally, not just towards the media, as if the deal really is a merger.

At least this applies to their relations with the press.  At the Ministry of National Defense, Minister Gheorghe Tinca,  for instance, boosted up the press bureau, which is now holding  news conferences on a weekly basis. If we also consider the  fact that they appointed a young lady whose looks are crushing  the male journalists as the ministry's spokesperson, we can see  that we are dealing here with an attempt by the diplomat  Gheorghe Tinca to seduce the press by all means. Even if the  charm cast by the lady officer (with the grade of major) can  seriously affect the professionalism of the journalists, the  shrewdness of the new minister of defense is to be preferred  over the obvious hooliganism of other dignitaries vis-a-vis the  press. The decision to do everything possible in order to have  excellent relations with the press can also be noticed in the  case of the other two dignitaries appointed in the wake of the  recent governmental reshuffle. At his latest meeting with the  press, Doru Ioan Taracila, the minister of interior, satisfied  the journalists' taste for the sensational. Minister of Justice  Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian tried hard, along political and  journalistic lines, to convince the journalists that they have a  friend in him. But there is another interesting thing about the  three newly appointed ministers. Immediately after their  appointment, each one of them became the target of some press  attacks. At least the Ministry of National Defense came under  all sorts of attacks. In spite of all that, none of the new  ministers resorted to violent replies or, even worse, to banning  the access of adverse journalists to the departments they are  heading. Are we dealing here with people who are more  intelligent that their government colleagues? Are these people  more aware of the fact that the press is a power in today's  Romania? Regardless of the answer, one can only welcome their  attitude toward journalists, since it proves that they are aware  of journalists' vanity and also concerned with their public  image. Of course, the three are but at the start of their road.  It is not excluded that, following the example of other  dignitaries, they might lose their smiling kindness toward the  press after it continues to criticize them rightly or wrongly.  Anyhow, until there is proof to the contrary, we do not err in  stating that the new dignitaries seem determined to turn the  press into their ally. During his broad campaign of trying to  win over the journalists to his side, Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian  held a long news conference yesterday, where he announced, among  other things, that he plans to propose Judge Corneliu Turianu  for a leading position in the justice department. The new  minister seems determined to repair all the mistakes made by his  predecessor, Petre Ninosu, prominent leader of the Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Yesterday's announcement is  a serious blow to one of Ion Iliescu's most humble servants.  First came his unexpected dismissal. Then came his failure at  the vote in the Senate [for the position as Senate vice  president]. Now, the new minister is canceling a decision taken  by Petre Ninosu. We are thus witnessing a happy moment of  justice being done to a wronged man. Corneliu Turianu was  illegally removed from the presidency of the Bucharest Military  Court by the former justice minister. A certain part of the  press jumped, so to say, to Corneliu Turianu's defense. Petre  Ninosu's political friends violently reacted to this rightful  stand taken by the independent journalists. Now, life is giving  credit to those who condemned Petre Ninosu's decision. Another  act of destiny seems to be the downfall of Iosif Gavril  Chiuzbaian's predecessor. In real life, all sins must be paid  for. Petre Ninosu is also paying for the injustice he has done.  Nevertheless, aside from all this, the PDSR is faced with a  most pressing problem, which belongs more to the realm of  metaphysics than politics. In spite of everything, Petre Ninosu  is one of their people. I realize that they could do nothing to  keep him in the post of minister of justice. I realize that  they could not promote him to the position of vice president of  the Senate. However, what I cannot understand is why they do  not jump now to defend the decision taken by Petre Ninosu with  regard to Corneliu Turianu's case. This because the statement  of the new minister of justice is extremely ominous for the  PDSR. It demonstrates to all present ministers that a time may  come, after their departure from their posts, that their  decisions can be canceled. Not by opposition ministers, but  even by other PDSR ministers. This might make quite a few of  these dignitaries think twice before they place their party's  interests before the interests of the country.     "

Mr Andrew Jones, manager of Honda's Pounds 300m plant in Swindon, Wiltshire, said the company aimed to achieve an assembly time of 12.5 hours a car for its large family car, the Honda Accord. The Swindon plant started production in October and aims to reach its capacity of 100,000 cars a year with two car ranges in 1995. Productivity at Japanese carmakers' new plants in Europe, mainly in the UK, is setting tough standards for European producers, whose productivity is often half the best Japanese levels. Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK, said it had cut 'hours per car' for its UK-built Primera - similar in size to the Accord - to 12.5. He said 'the best of the Europeans are running at around 20 hours per car' for the same class of vehicle. European competitors in this market segment include the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, Ford Mondeo, Peugeot 405 and Volkswagen Passat. The hours-per-car yardstick used by Nissan and Honda measures so-called direct labour in the body welding, painting and final trim and assembly parts of the manufacturing operation. These processes are becoming established as a standard definition in measuring car plant productivity. Carmakers differ on the measurement of hours in their plants, but the size of the competitive gap has startled European producers. Honda's European sales push, Page 2   Companies:-  Honda Motor.

But as yet his departure has not even scratched the paintwork of GM's financial performance. Despite the spluttering US economic recovery GM seems to be on target to break even on its North American operations this year. While unsatisfactory, that is at least a significant improvement on the Dollars 11bn-worth of losses in 1991 and 1992. General Motors has a long way to go - its vehicles, for example, still cost some Dollars 800 more each than Ford's to produce. Yet heavy cost-cutting seems to be having an effect and GM's gross margins rose by 1.9 percentage points in the first half of 1993. The company is also starting to rationalise the duplication in areas such as component design, so that engineers will have to select from a limited set of standard parts. Not all of the restructuring is negative. GM is putting the experience of its Japanese-style Saturn plant to work elsewhere in the group, and it is gaining market share as it produces more attractive models. In part, the company has been helped by the strength of the yen, which has made Japanese imports less attractive. That has given GM an extra breathing space it scarcely deserved. Whether the company and its workforce are really determined to capitalise on the opportunity may show more clearly in the negotiations for a three-year pay deal this autumn.

It said it would start building a factory for passenger cars in July at a yet undetermined site and begin producing vehicles at the end of 1997, making it the country's fifth car company. The statement followed a report on Tuesday by a state research institute warning that Samsung's entry into the car industry could lead to excess production capacity. Samsung Heavy Industries is holding negotiations with Nissan and Toyota on the supply of vehicle technology. Korea's big three carmakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - have also expressed opposition to Samsung's entry, claiming it would severely disrupt the Korean motor industry. The government may try to block Samsung's proposed car project by turning down its application for the import of foreign technology. Samsung is expected to file an application with the ministry of trade and industry next month. The ministry has the right to refuse a foreign technology import request if it threatens the national economy. The report by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade (KIIET), which is associated with the ministry, could be used to block Samsung. It was commissioned by the Korea Automobile Manufacturers' Association, and warned that Samsung's import of Japanese technology would damage efforts to achieve technical self-sufficiency in the motor industry.

Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, and Mr Alain Lamassoure, minister for European affairs, have written to Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, expressing worries about the deal, which should lead to a 9.4 per cent drop in the number of Japanese cars and vans exported to the EC this year. The Commission has not yet received the letter, but officials said yesterday they believed the concerns were mainly 'technical'. France is one of five EC countries which have had to lift national quotas on Japanese vehicles, as part of a 1991 agreement which should lead to a completely open EC market by the end of the decade. In spite of the overall drop in exports to the EC, Japanese exports to France will actually increase this year from 69,016 to 77,300, as the liberalisation of the French market begins to take effect. The new French government wants to know how the EC estimated demand in the Community for 1993. Japanese and Community officials agreed earlier this month that European demand would fall by 6.5 per cent against 1992, but the French industry estimates that its national market could shrink by as much as 10 per cent. French manufacturers are also concerned about the impact of imports of Japanese cars made in other Community countries.

The German producer of high-performance executive and luxury cars plans to unveil a concept city car, code-named Z13, at the Geneva motor show next month, upstaging its arch domestic rival Mercedes-Benz, which last week said it planned to develop such a car for the late 1990s. The BMW city car has been designed and developed for a 'single' driver travelling alone in city traffic. The driver would sit in the middle of the car with a central steering wheel, but with two full-sized seats for possible passengers seated half behind the driver in a clover-leaf formation. The planned city car is powered by a 1.1-litre BMW motorcycle engine mounted at the rear with a continuously variable automatic transmission. At just over 11 ft it would be smaller than current small cars, such as the Ford Fiesta or the Renault Clio, but would have a top speed of 112 mph and fuel consumption of 47-56 miles per gallon. The car would have an aluminium frame and aluminium panels, and despite its small size BMW said it could include an airbag, air-conditioning, a mobile telephone, a computer controlled navigation system and a mobile fax machine.

European competitors in this market segment include the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, Ford Mondeo, Peugeot 405 and Volkswagen Passat. The hours-per-car yardstick used by Nissan and Honda measures so-called direct labour in the body welding, painting and final trim and assembly parts of the manufacturing operation. These processes are becoming established as a standard definition in measuring car plant productivity. Professor Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at Cardiff Business School, said the productivity of European car assembly plants, measured by direct hours and excluding support staff, averaged 20 to 22 hours per car.

The company, in the throes of a restructuring to return loss-making North American operations to profit, said that in the model year starting in October, it would expand the 'value pricing' marketing idea it initiated in 1993. This involves dropping the price of certain models of vehicles equipped with popular levels of optional equipment. The idea is to lift sales and run GM's factories closer to capacity, to raise profits. Mr Michael Losh, a GM vice-president, said value pricing had been a factor behind the resurgence of GM's North American sales this year. The company's share of the US passenger car market fell sharply late last calendar year, to less than 31 per cent, when it cut back sharply on unprofitable sales to fleet buyers. It has recovered this year and for June totalled 37.1 per cent, compared with 36.7 per cent a year earlier, but for the first half of 1993 it was down a point on 1992, at 35.3 per cent. The recovery has been due to value pricing and because Japanese competitors, hurt by a strong yen, have been increasing their prices further. Mr Losh said that in the 1994 model year, GM's prices would rise by 1.5 per cent, even though they were fitted with additional equipment. Truck prices would rise by 2.2 per cent and the average price for GM vehicles would go up about 1.8 per cent.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

But the result was a 49 per cent improvement on the 1992 loss of SKr2.68bn and included a one-off charge of SKr299m incurred during the start-up and launch of the new Saab 900 model which went on sale last autumn. Saab, which has talked of a possible return to profit in 1994 for some months, said yesterday the chances of reaching break-even were good. Sales rose to SKr16.12bn from SKr14.69bn, but this reflected the slide in the value of the Swedish krona during 1993. The number of vehicles sold was down sharply, also for the fifth year in succession, at 73,600, compared with 86,800 in 1992. Saab, jointly owned by GM and Sweden's Saab-Scania, has swallowed more than SKr8bn in new capital from its owners and accumulated losses of more than SKr11bn since GM bought into the company in 1989 seeking a prestige European marque to extend its range into an up-market niche. After a radical restructuring, during which it has almost halved it workforce to 7,900, it is pinning its hopes for recovery on the 900 model, coupled with improving conditions in its three main markets - Sweden, the US and Britain. Saab has set a tough target of selling 87,000 vehicles from its 9000 and 900 ranges this year but says this is realistic.   Companies:-  Saab Automobile.   Countries:-  SEZ  Sweden, West Europe.

Mr Roland Klein, Daimler-Benz spokesman, confirmed yesterday that a possible collaboration between the two companies was on the agenda as the company's board meets for its usual Tuesday meeting. But he warned that no final decision was yet in sight. The 'Swatchmobile' project has been promoted by Mr Nicolas Hayek, SMH chairman, for several years. Volkswagen was involved, but withdrew in January last year. Volkswagen said then it was under pressure to cut costs and wanted to avoid the heavy invest-ment associated with the project. Speculation that Daimler-Benz would build the long-awaited Swatch car has recently increased after Mr Helmut Werner, the chairman of Mercedes, said last week in Frankfurt that his company may team up with Swatch. SMH has been talking with various carmakers for about a year. The new two-seater, environmentally-friendly small car would be a welcome addition to the Mercedes range in the face of increased competition in what is deemed an increasingly important strategic market segment. German rival carmaker Volkswagen recently announced that its Audi subsidiary would build a small car starting in 1996. And BMW is taking control of the British car producer Rover, which manufactures similar cars. 'Nothing has been decided,' a spokeswoman for Swatch said, adding that the group would be making no announcement today. Mr Hayek said recently he expected to name a partner this year.

A survey published by the European Commission suggested yesterday that around 80 per cent of the prices for cars produced by European manufacturers and 90 per cent of Japanese models showed price differentials of less than 20 per cent as at the end of November. The Commission said that Spain and Portugal were the lowest priced markets in the EU, while Germany was the highest. The European Automobile Industry Association (ACEA) claimed that manufacturers' efforts to reduce price differences had not been reflected in the prices published by the Commission, as they had largely been offset by recent currency realignments versus the Ecu. These had varied from a 3 per cent revaluation in the DM and the guilder and 7 per cent devaluations of the escudo and the peseta. The ACEA claimed that currency fluctations were the 'decisive influence' on car prices. Spain was now the lowest priced market in the EU, but only in June last year it had been the highest priced market. The Commission accepted that car manufacturers had tended to reduce price differentials for most of their models, and said that about 90 per cent of all car price differentials were less than 20 per cent. All of the European manufacturers have price differentials of more than 25 per cent for at least one model, however.   Countries:-  XJZ  West Europe.

0,FT933-12538 ,"FT933-12538 _AN-DGWCHAEYFT 930723   FT  23 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen   Given the welter of publicity surrounding the industrial espionage row between Volkswagen and GM, it is surprising that the former's shares have fallen less than 7 per cent since their 1993 peak earlier this month. The reason may be that, as with the clash between British Airways and Virgin in the UK, the implications for the company are less than meets the eye. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua has acquired a legendary reputation in the motor industry, but GM's share price quickly recovered from the shock of his defection in March. It is far from clear whether his tenure at VW will be unnaturally short, but the effect may be equally transitory if the worst does come to the worst. VW's labour-shedding programme was in place before Mr Lopez arrived with a brief to cut component costs. His appointment was a final admission on VW's part that radical action was needed. Mr Lopez has not been there long, but he will have had sufficient time to indicate to his new employers how much saving to expect and how it can be achieved. It matters less who now actually implements a programme similar to that already carried out by other large motor companies. The greater risk to VW is that, in promising to return to the black next year, it may have underestimated the downturn in the European car market. If it is protracted, producers may have to contend with price falls as well as lower volumes. That would cancel out some of the cost savings VW is now starting to generate.

Honda's collaborative strategy in Europe has spectacularly collapsed, while Toyota and Nissan's self-reliance has been vindicated. Daring to be different and then failing must be doubly uncomfortable in a country where conformity is an art form. Honda had to be seen to respond to the slight BAe delivered when it sold Rover to the cheeky Bavarians. It also views BMW as a serious competitor, particularly in North America. The prospect of BMW pitching up at Honda's Swindon plant, displaying its 20 per cent shareholding in Honda UK and demanding to see the books, must have caused a few sleepless nights in Tokyo. But if severing equity links marks a clear change of strategic direction and restores some lost face, commercial realities still demand some connections. Replacing Rover's engine orders or cutting overheads by enough to offset the lost volumes would be very difficult, especially given the deep recession in Japan's car industry. Abandoning the jointly-developed replacement for the Rover 200/400-Honda Concerto would also be very expensive revenge. However painful, the prospect is thus for continued operational involvement between the two companies. That leaves BMW free to invest in developing Land Rover and a new small car. Honda, having fallen behind its domestic rivals, will have to spend heavily on beefing up its European presence. The lessons of trying to co-operate with short-termist westerners are unlikely to be lost on the rest of corporate Japan.   Companies:-  Rover Group.     Honda Motor.     Bayerische Motoren Werke.

Nissan has now won a Queen's award for three years in succession while Honda joins the ranks of winners for the first time      By KEVIN DONE   Japanese carmakers have quickly established the UK as their main bridgehead in Europe and last year accounted for three of the top six places as UK car exporters. Nissan, which has now won the Queen's Award for Exports for three years in succession, emerged as the leading UK car exporter last year outstripping the traditional heavyweights of the motor industry in Britain, Rover group, Ford and Vauxhall. Honda has joined the ranks of export award winners for the first time, as production builds up at its plant at Swindon, Wiltshire. Its award this time, however, is largely based on exports of cars produced for it under licence at Rover's Longbridge, Birmingham assembly plant. Car output is also rising quickly at the Toyota car assembly plant at Burnaston, near Derby. By the second half of the 1990s Japanese carmakers will be accounting for around a third of UK car production. Nissan, which has the largest share of any Japanese carmaker both in the UK and in the overall western European new car markets, was the first Japanese producer to begin car production in Europe in 1986. By last year output at its Pounds 900m plant at Sunderland in north-east England, had jumped to 246,281 of which 74 per cent was exported, although production is forecast by the company to fall to between 200,000 and 240,000 this year. Nissan's car exports have climbed from 59,739 in 1990 to 112,700 in 1991, to 157,234 in 1992 and reached a peak of 182,207 last year. Exports accounted for around 90 per cent of output in both 1991 and 1992, when the UK market was in recession, but the export share fell last year, as demand picked up in the UK and markets weakened in continental Europe. Measured by the volume of car exports, Nissan moved ahead of the Rover group, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, for the first time last year with shipments of 182,207 compared with the Rover group's 161,932. The Rover total included some Honda Concertos produced for the Japanese car maker under licence at Rover's Longbridge, Birmingham, plant. Trailing in the wake of these two groups were General Motors of the US with its Vauxhall and IBC Vehicles subsidiaries with car exports of 72,090, and the Ford group of the US with total car exports of 34,217. The Ford total included 22,999 Jaguars and only 11,218 cars exported under the Ford badge. Ford car exports, excluding Jaguar, have plunged under the impact of the recession in continental European new car markets falling from 120,178 in 1991 and 72,825 in 1992. The volume of exports of Ford-badged cars was overtaken last year by all three Japanese carmakers producing in the UK. Toyota car export volumes of 27,735 and Honda exports of 27,121 (excluding cars produced under licence by Rover) also exceeded exports by Peugeot Talbot, a former Queen's Export award winner. Peugeot's shipments of cars from the UK fell to 25,975 from 52,099 in 1992 and a peak of 83,591 in 1990. Honda and Toyota both began production in the UK at their own plants in late 1992, although the assembly of Honda-badged cars under licence by Rover in the UK began in 1986 with the export of such cars starting in 1987. Honda itself produced 32,139 cars (the Accord large family car) at its Pounds 370m plant at Swindon last year, of which 84 per cent were exported. Output at the plant is planned to rise to 50,000 this year and to 100,000 in 1995. Its export effort, which until late 1992, was based on cars assembled by Rover, is set to gather pace rapidly, when it adds production of a second car range at Swindon late this year. Production of the Honda Concerto by Rover will cease later this year, and the replacement car will be produced at Swindon. Output by Toyota at its Pounds 700m Burnaston car plant (it is also investing Pounds 140m at its Deeside engine plant) totalled 37,314 last year, of which 74 per cent was exported. Output is planned to reach 100,000 already this year. Nissan said that the export earnings of its Sunderland plant totalled Pounds 967m in 1993 compared with Pounds 911m in 1992 and Pounds 695m in 1991. It said the overall contribution by the plant to the UK balance of trade totalled around Pounds 500m after subtracting the value of imported components. Honda said that the value of its exports rose from Pounds 160m in 1991 to Pounds 188m in 1992 and Pounds 304m in 1993, although in the first two years the exports were solely of cars assembled for it by Rover under licence.

0,FT942-7233 ,"FT942-7233 _AN-EEZDOAETFT 940526   FT  26 MAY 94 / Making a marque on the world: GM is using Opel as a springboard for global growth      By KEVIN DONE   General Motors is using its German subsidiary Opel to spearhead its expansion into international car markets outside the US. While its domestic North American automotive operations have racked up four years of heavy losses, GM has opted to use its healthier European car business as its springboard for geographic expansion. GM Europe's agreement to establish a joint venture in India to assemble the Opel Astra is the latest move by the world's leading vehicle maker to gain a foothold in emerging car markets. Opel products have been in the forefront of GM's effort to set up assembly in Turkey and eastern Europe - the Astra small family car is produced in Hungary and production is due to begin in Poland. They are also leading the drive to build GM's presence in Asia. Assembly of the Opel Astra began in Taiwan last year, small volume production of the Opel Vectra family car will start in Indonesia later this year, to be followed by production of the Astra in India in 1995. Mr Louis Hughes, executive vice-president of GM's international operations and president of GM Europe, says the group 'has made a strategic decision to further internationalise and expand the Opel name and Opel products around the world'. The world's biggest carmakers all believe the Asia/Pacific region holds the brightest prospects for growth. Car sales in Asia (excluding Japan) are expected to triple during the next 15 years. According to Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, GM's rival, 80 per cent of the world's population lives outside the traditional automotive markets of western Europe, North America and Japan. The number of cars and trucks sold in these regions, however, represents only about 8 per cent of the global total. This view is confirmed by the latest study of world car markets by DRI McGraw-Hill, the London-based analysts, which forecasts that new car sales worldwide will rise from 33.2m last year to 42.5m in 1999, a near 30 per cent jump. The report cites South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and eastern Europe as offering the best growth prospects. For a long time US vehicle makers - as well as the Europeans - neglected Asian markets, allowing them to become largely the preserve of their Japanese rivals. Belatedly they are seeking to regain lost ground. 'We are number two in Europe and in Latin America and our sights are zeroed in on growth in Asia and the Pacific,' Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, told shareholders last week. While Ford has embarked on an ambitious strategy of merging its North American and European operations to try to eliminate duplication and lay the foundations for developing more so-called 'world cars', GM has chosen to lead its international operations from Europe with the aim of integrating its European, Latin American and Australian engineering activities. Most of the products to be sold in these regions, as well as in Asia, will originate from the Opel technical development centre in Russelsheim, near Frankfurt, and will be developed from the European product range. Mr Hughes describes the Opel Corsa supermini as GM's most international car. Already in production in Spain, Germany and Brazil and planned for Mexico, GM is also studying Corsa assembly in China and Russia. Apart from building a network of Opel assembly plants across Asia, GM is also increasing exports of cars from Europe. Opel is being used as the group's main marque in Japan, where GM has set a target of selling 100,000 cars a year by 2000. It has taken advantage of the conflict between the Volkswagen group and Yanase, the VW/Audi importer in Japan, to win over the Yanase dealer network for Opel. Sales of Opel cars in Japan jumped last year to 17,042 from only 1,371 in 1992. By contrast VW/Audi sales plunged to 24,878 from 42,083. 'In the last four to five years Opel has gone from being very much a Europe-oriented carmaker to an international company with global export sales and local assembly and manufacturing,' says Mr Peter Hanenberger, GM Europe vice-president for design, product and manufacturing engineering. Signs are also emerging that GM eventually plans closer co-ordination between Opel and its North American automotive operations. GM Europe is developing a version of its new Opel Omega executive car for sale in North America under the Cadillac brand name. This will be the US carmaker's first substantial export of cars from Europe to North America since the early 1960s, and the first European-produced GM car to be sold under a North American nameplate. The process can also happen in reverse. GM is planning for the first time to export to Europe a version of its next generation US-produced MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) for sale under the Opel/Vauxhall badges, to compete with vehicles such as the Renault Espace. According to Mr Smith, the programme for a European-produced Cadillac is 'one of the most significant international projects GM has undertaken . . . It makes little sense to build duplicate components or near-duplicate platforms (chassis) for different regional market segments, when one region can adapt or tailor what is being developed for another.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GM's 'world cars': Production/assembly of Opel cars in emerging markets:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Corsa:      Astra:                        Vectra: Existing:    Brazil      Hungary, Taiwan, S Africa,    Brazil, Turkey,                          Turkey                        Egypt,                                                        Malaysia Planned:     Mexico,     Poland, India, Thailand,      Indonesia,                          Indonesia,                    Thailand.

0,FT943-6204 ,"FT943-6204 _AN-EH4EGABNFT 940831   FT  31 AUG 94 / Rover leads rise in car output with 20% surge      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   Rover, the leading UK carmaker, increased vehicle production 20.8 per cent year-on-year in the first six months of 1994, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders says. Overall UK car output rose 1.2 per cent in the first half to 751,717 from 742,969 in the same period a year ago, but the society forecasts that growth in production will accelerate during the second half of the year. Higher output by Rover, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, together with the build-up of production by Toyota and Honda at their UK assembly plants, helped to offset declines at Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot and a sharp fall in production at Nissan. The rise in Rover car and commercial vehicle output - to 251,947 from 208,521 a year ago - has been helped most importantly by the introduction of its Rover 600 executive car range, launched in spring last year, as well as by rising sales of the Land Rover Discovery. The company has announced it is investing Pounds 68m to expand Discovery production by 20 per cent to 1,500 a week during the autumn. Production at Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant fell by a third during the first half of the year to 93,000 from 141,000 in the same period a year ago. The company was forced to halve production for nearly four months until early March with the elimination of its second shift in order to cut stocks and to bring output into line with sharply lower demand in continental Europe. Production at Toyota's Pounds 700m assembly plant at Burnaston, near Derby, which began at the end of 1992, was almost tripled in the first half this year to 43,000 from 15,000 a year ago. The plant, which will have an eventual capacity of at least 200,000 cars a year, is expected to produce more than 90,000 cars in 1994. Production of commercial vehicles began to recover from recession during the first six months, albeit from a very low level. Output in the first six months, at 116,692, was 10.2 per cent higher than a year ago. Commercial vehicle output has been in a state of almost continuous decline since 1969 when it peaked at 466,000. Production fell 22.2 per cent last year to 193,414, the lowest since 1948.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BIG INCREASES FOR HONDA AND TOYOTA  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Vehicle production               1994          1993           1994/93 in the UK                      Jan-June      Jan-June         % Change  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS Total                           751,717       742,969           +1.2 Rover (BMW)                     239,352       199,914          +19.7  -   cars***                    206,912       176,626          +17.1  - Land Rover                    32,440        23,288          +39.3 Ford group                      164,564       177,995           -7.5  -   Ford                       150,576       163,628           -8.0  -   Jaguar                      13,946        14,331           -2.7  -   Aston Martin                    42            36          +16.7 General Motors group            149,756       153,345           -2.3  -   Vauxhall                   127,525       132,492           -3.7  -   IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)**   22,231        20,853           +6.6 Nissan                           93,194       140,713          -33.8 Toyota                           43,120        15,300         +181.8 Peugeot                          38,965        40,355           -3.4 Honda                            19,780        13,014          +52.0 Rolls-Royce (Vickers)               712           559          +27.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMERCIAL VEHICLES Total                           116,692       105,853          +10.2 Ford                             77,761        72,249           +7.6 Rover (BMW)                      12,595         9,207          +36.8  -   car-derived vans             1,620           967          +67.5  -   Land Rover                  10,975         8,240          +33.2 General Motors group              9,923        12,038          -17.6  -   Vauxhall                     7,124         6,915           +3.0  -   IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)*     2,799         5,123          -45.4 LDV                               5,860         4,664          +25.6 Leyland Trucks                    3,869         2,351          +64.6 Iveco (Fiat)                      3,387         2,740          +23.6  -   Iveco-Ford                   2,857         2,363          +20.9  -   Seddon Atkinson                530           377          +40.6 ERF                               1,399         1,112          +25.8 Dennis (Trinity Holdings)           790           635          +24.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Medium vans sold in Europe variously under Vauxhall, Isuzu, GME and Bedford names. **Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. ***Includes Honda Concerto.

0,FT932-9095 ,"FT932-9095 _AN-DEPANABRFT 930515   FT  15 MAY 93 / Motoring costs 'outstrip inflation'      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   THE cost of motoring in Britain is rising faster than the rate of inflation, the Automobile Association claimed yesterday. The average motorist driving 10,000 miles a year will pay between Pounds 130 and Pounds 375 more in 1993 than last year depending on the size of car. Increases in insurance premiums, road tax and fuel duty are the main factors in raising motoring costs along with increases in new car list prices. According to the AA the average cost of running a 1.4 to 2 litre car is about Pounds 4,559 a year or 45.6p a mile based on 10,000 miles of driving. This includes total standing charges of Pounds 2,909 - car licence (Pounds 125), insurance (Pounds 968), depreciation (Pounds 1,752), road organisation membership (Pounds 64) - or 29.1p per mile. On average, motoring costs for a car with a 1.4 to 2 litre petrol engine are expected to rise by 5.5 per cent this year. The Department of Transport yesterday published data on accident rates for different makes and models of cars. Its information, based on 70,000 accident statistics from 1989-1991, lists 90 models. It says newer private cars have lower casualty rates than older cars and that the driver of a small car is about 50 per cent more likely to be injured when involved in an accident than the driver of a large car. The Consumers Association said it was concerned that the information on car safety in a department leaflet was difficult for consumers to use and potentially misleading. Cars: Make and Model.

0,FT932-6571 ,"FT932-6571 _AN-DE0B8AHEFT 930527   FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (13): Room for more cost-cutting - Industrial companies are responding to foreign competition      By JOHN BARHAM   INDUSTRIALISTS say their message is at last getting through to Mr Domingo Cavallo: market forces alone will not be enough to transform Argentina's obsolete and uncompetitive industry. Mr Cavallo does seem to have begun shifting away from a laisser-faire to a more interventionist approach. The main changes are: Loans bearing below-market interest from the government's Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA) worth Dollars 4.5bn this year, will be targeted mainly at exporters, small businesses and farmers. Companies can import capital goods duty free, at a saving of at least 10 per cent. Domestic capital goods makers are entitled to a 15 per cent subsidy. Last October's imposition of a 10 per cent surcharge on all imports (now waived for capital goods), a move specifically designed to increase industry's protection from imports. However, Mr Cavallo is quick to deny that these changes represent a shift back towards statism. His point is that having achieved macro-economic stabilisation, the government is now able to turn its attention to micro-economic issues that it previously had to ignore. Mr Cavallo's efforts to redirect bank lending to industry and create a broader capital market are encountering considerable obstacles. Despite the government's greater interest in industrial policy, businesses are aware that there will be no return to pretectionism. They see Mr Cavallo's refocusing as little more than fine tuning. The corporate scene varies immensely. Industries insulated from external competition such as cars, or those in the service sector, such as telecommunications, or those in the booming consumer goods market, are reaping vast profits. But exporters or companies facing import competition - especially from Brazil - must contend with an uncompetitive currency and one of the world's freest trade policies, despite a hefty rise in import duties last year. The paper and pulp, steel, textile and petrochemicals industries are suffering the most, but Mr Cavallo has rejected demands for special breaks for these industries. Companies are responding by aggressive cost cutting and productivity drives. IBM, for instance, has been able to maintain its 6 per cent margin on its exports of magnetic tape units and printers. All staff are on some form of performance-related pay. Still, Mr Ricardo Martorana, IBM's president, says there is still room for yet more cost cutting. Even a medium-sized company like SICA, a family-owned electrical company, is biting the bullet. Mr Cesar Wengrower, its vice president, says he has had to cut his workforce by a 20 per cent and boost sales by 20 per cent to hold his margin at 7 per cent of sales. The car industry remains the big exception to the government's free market principles. The industry is protected by import duties of 20 per cent and quotas limiting import penetration to 9 per cent of the market. Manufacturers may, however, import cars and pay a token 2 per cent duty. Individuals can also import cars, but facea 20 per cent tariff. the effects of import liberalisation can be seen on the streets of Buenos Aires, where imported cars, once rarities, are now a common sight. Trade in cars between Argentina and Brazil is carefully controlled. Bilateral car trade is set at 40,000 units a year, and trade between the two countries must be balanced. However, recession in Brazil and boom times in Argentina led to a 20,000 vehicle shortfall in Argentine exports to Brazil. Mr Edward Orsini, vice-president of Autolatina, the Volkswagen-Ford joint venture with factories in Argentina and Brazil, says Argentina's car regime is no more restrictive than other countries. And, as elsewhere, car industry policy is a delicate issue because car companies employ many people. The corollary of protection is regulation: for example, car companies may now be able to import more, but they must balance their trade, no easy task when Argentina's productivity still lags leading markets by about 30-50 per cent. However, the car industry is making progress in closing the productivity gap. Autolatina has been able to hold its margins steady for the last two years, despite sharp increases in labour and other fixed costs. The industry's output last year hit a record 261,942 units, up from just 99,639 in 1990, the worst year on record. Mr Manuel Antelo, president of CIADEA, the smallest of Argentina's three carmakers which makes Renault cars under licence, says 'this bonanza will last for many years'. He says that Argentina could be building 500,000 units a year within three years. The recovery brought Autolatina into the black in 1991 for the first time in a decade. CIADEA expects a Dollars 80m-100m 1993 net profit on sales of Dollars 1.4bn. Improved trading conditions are drawing companies back to Argentina. In May, General Motors announced it would invest Dollars 100m in a pick-up truck plant in Argentina, 15 years after quitting as the country sank into political anarchy. CIADEA, GM's local partner plans investments of its own of about Dollars 150m in 1993-94. Industrial investments like these are desperately needed to shore up Argentina's lopsided trade structure: 70 per cent of its exports are primary goods, but nearly all its imports are industrial products. Most of the investment seen in the last two years has taken the form of incorporating new equipment rather than greenfield expansions. Trade data show that imports of capital goods in 1992 rose to Dollars 3.87bn, twice the previous year's level and the highest figure in over 20 years. Just as important, companies need to develop modern management techniques. One Argentine executive commented: 'Private company management leaves a lot to be desired. Managers are complacent: they must change their mentality. The changes that Cavallo is trying to bring require new management skills.'   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

0,FT942-10658 ,"FT942-10658 _AN-EEJC9ABIFT 940510   FT  10 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Honda plans Mexican factory      By DAMIAN FRASER      MEXICO CITY   Honda, the Japanese car company, said yesterday it intended to build a car plant in Mexico, a further sign of growing international interest in the country's vehicle sector. The move will make it the eighth vehicle producer in the country. Mr Yoshihido Munekuni, vice-president of Honda, told the Mexican government the plant would initially produce 15,000 cars a year, and employ some 250 workers. Honda said it plans eventually to double the plant's initial 15,000-unit capacity. Honda's decision to build a Mexican plant follows a similar announcement by BMW last month. BMW intends to assembly luxury cars in Mexico from the middle of next year, and bring parts producers to Mexico to supply its planned car plant in South Carolina, US. The total production of Honda's plant is small even by Mexican standards, with planned production just a fraction of the more than 100,000 cars a year each of the five main companies sell in the domestic market. According to Mr Miguel Angle Olea, a Mexican consultant to car companies, Honda is preparing for liberalisation of Mexico's car sector, when it will be able to import cars into Mexico.

Further talks will be held soon, to include union leaders, to decide the fate of the outdated Zona Franca works and the 10,500 employed on the site, VW said last night. A solution is expected before the end of the year. Ideas proposed yesterday are believed to include converting the factory into an industrial park and establishing a state-owned employment company to deal with those who lose their jobs. The deal was agreed during talks in Madrid and Barcelona led by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, Mr Narcis Serra, deputy prime minister, and Mr Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalonian government. The agreement sees a significant relaxation of the conditions under which Seat is to be given a DM1.5bn (Pounds 600m) cash injection. Ownership of the Spanish company's Pamplona factory, used exclusively to build VW Polo models, will not now be transferred to the German parent. Although operations will be 'steered' by VW, it will remain under Spanish management. The government said Mr Piech and Mr Serra had agreed to find a solution which involves an increase in productivity for Seat to recover its competitiveness. That is likely to mean VW will insist on the loss of most of the jobs at Zona Franca, although some workers may be found places at Seat's new plant at Martorell, around 30km from Barcelona.

The downgrading reflected 'increasingly difficult' industry conditions in Europe, said the agency, and follows the lowering of debt ratings for other car producers including Nissan and Honda of Japan and BMW of Germany. The ratings of Renault and the PSA Peugeot Citroen group of France are also being examined and have been placed on the agency's credit watch 'with negative implications'. SP has lowered the rating of VW's long-term debt to A+ from AA- (the highest investment grade rating is AAA, and the lowest is BBB), while VW's commercial paper rating has been lowered to A-1 from A-1+. Fiat's commercial paper rating has been lowered to A-2 from A-1. The rating outlook for Volkswagen was negative, said SP, because of the extent of the group's cost problems and 'uncertainty over the adequacy of its remedial actions'. Fiat's competitive position was weak owing to the company's ageing product range and high degree of reliance on the Italian market. The success of its current new product development programme was critical. SP said the increasing economic integration of Europe meant that the automotive market was more subject to volatile cyclical fluctuations than in the past. Long-term growth was expected to slow as markets approached saturation, and competition was intensifying as national trade barriers were eliminated. Significant excess capacity in the European car industry was expected to persist, due in part to the development of new assembly plants by leading Japanese carmakers.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

The FIP I/M program would initiate testing 100 percent of the subject vehicle population beginning in January 1997.        d. Enhanced In-Use Compliance Program for Light-Duty Vehicles    _EPA expects the California Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program will substantially reduce emissions of cars and light-duty trucks, compared to the federal standards. However, despite the use of advanced technologies and the OBD requirements, CARB projects LEVS will exceed their certification standards in-use, although, for the reasons noted in Section III.D.1.a(2), by a much smaller margin than has occurred in the past. Emissions above the certification standards, referred to as excess emissions, will occur because some models may experience more in-use deterioration than expected, or because individual vehicles experience component failure or improper maintenance which is not immediately corrected by the various existing in-use compliance programs, including enhanced I/M. Because the magnitude of the emission reductions needed for attainment is so great, the adoption of further measures to reduce these remaining excess in-use emissions will help reach attainment of the ozone standard.    EPA is therefore seeking comments on the need for and benefits of adopting an enhanced in-use compliance program which would provide extra emission reductions above and beyond the substantial reduction provided by the California LEV program, and cause in-use emissions to approach the certification standards. Specifically, EPA is considering three approaches. The first would modify the current federal recall program to initiate recalls based on the emission results of vehicles tested in their as received condition. This differs from current practice, and would result in a shift of responsibility for maintaining low emissions from the consumer to the vehicle manufacturers.    The second possible program would make manufacturers responsible for repairs for vehicles whose failure rate for that model in an enhanced I/M program exceeds a threshold level (e.g., greater than 5 percent within the first 5 years). This approach, like the first approach, provides an incentive for vehicle manufacturers to increase the durability of their designs, or implement other programs designed to maintain the emissions of their products in-use. Both of these possible programs would apply throughout a vehicle's statutory useful life.    The third possible program involves adoption of a requirement that the on-board diagnostic system of new vehicles be capable of communicating, to on-road sensors, the operational status of the emission control system (i.e., whether a fault has been detected). This approach allows for the immediate identification of high emitting vehicles, and their timely repair. Unlike the first two approaches, this approach would remain in effect for the vehicles's entire life, a significant point since over 40 percent of cars and light trucks on California's highways have over 100,000 miles on their odometer.    EPA requests comments on these three approaches, and on any other approaches to further reduce in-use emissions. Comments should address the need for and viability of EPA implementing, within the context of the FIP, compliance programs in addition to those already adopted by California. EPA is proposing to adopt the enhanced in-use compliance program described in Appendix I A.        e. On-highway Motorcycles    _Provisions for on-highway motorcycles are contained in section III.D.4.c(1). Because engines used in nonroad recreational vehicles such as all terrain vehicles and dirt bikes are similar to those used in on-highway motorcycles, all control strategies for these engines are contained in the section referenced in the preceding sentence.        f. Discussion of Emission Registration and Fee Systems for Light Duty Vehicles    _In the light duty vehicle and light duty truck sector, emission reductions can result from direct regulation of the vehicle and fuels or can be brought about by regulations or incentives (either positive or negative) to change vehicle ownership patterns and/or driver behavior. Emission standards for light duty vehicles and their fuel have significantly decreased the amount of pollution emitted by any one vehicle over a given mile. Standards continue to tighten and within the FIP EPA is proposing to reduce tailpipe and evaporative emissions even further.    Additional reductions could come from incentives to increase the number newer vehicles on the road and reduce the number of older vehicles. Accelerating fleet turnover through any means would reduce on road emissions by replacing older vehicles (which have older emissions technology) with newer, cleaner vehicles.               "

While BAe pointed to its investment in Rover at the time of the sale, in truth most of that money had come from Rover's own cash flow. That limited the need for external finance, but did not provide a long-term solution to Rover's capital needs. Much now turns on Honda's attitude to BMW and Rover. If it withdraws co-operation at an early stage, BMW will have to fund some early conversion of Rover's models. Against that, many of Honda's supply contracts are highly profitable, so a deal may well be struck. It is still possible that Honda will join a tripartite alliance. Assuming that BMW had to go it alone, however, Land Rover will require substantial investment. Much of its cash has been diverted over the years to fund the improvement in Rover cars. Land Rover's engines and gear boxes are ageing, and need to be updated to take on Far Eastern competition. Capacity at the Solihull plant must also be significantly expanded if BMW intends to push Discovery and an updated Range Rover in the US. If Land Rover is allowed to keep its cash, it can fund much of the need. Rover, however, will require funds from BMW if its models are to be developed. The Rover 600 and 800 ranges may be rationalised or could borrow from BMW's 5-series. So the largest investment decision will be on the small car. BMW will have to find a large amount of money to replace the Metro and guarantee the Longbridge plant a long-term future.   Companies:-  Rover Group.     Bayerische Motoren Werke.     Honda Motor.

The two said the combined business would have estimated sales in 1993 of about Dollars 1.2bn and would be owned 60 per cent by FMC and 40 per cent by Harsco. FMC, with interests ranging from chemicals to machinery and equipment, will put into the partnership its Defence Systems group, which employs more than 6,000 people. Its best-known product is the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, a tracked vehicle armed with automatic cannon which saw extensive action with US troops in the Gulf war. Harsco will put into the group its BMY-Combat Systems division, which employs 2,000 people and makes tracked vehicles for artillery and combat support functions. The deal is part of a trend for US defence companies to merge their activities in a bid for greater efficiencies as the US defence budget shrinks following the end of the Cold War. Mr Malcolm Gambill, chairman of Harsco, said the two businesses were a natural fit and would be a 'powerhouse in tracked vehicles'. The deal would lead to some consolidation, with the removal of unneeded higher cost capacity. The new company will include FMC's naval systems division and its steel products division, which makes military track. However, Harsco will retain its BMY-Wheeled Vehicles division, which makes five-ton army trucks and has been suffering a dearth of orders.  The Financial Times   London Page 27  "

He confirmed that Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, and Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the production director, would attend the meeting, but would give no further details. The meeting is expected to discuss contingency plans to reduce debts and operating costs, including the possible transfer of Seat's Landaben plant in Pamplona to VW and reductions in the 23,000 payroll. Mr Piech is believed to have commissioned a special audit after receiving reports of a looming deficit at Seat this year of DM800m (Dollars 493.8m) or more, and requests for an urgent DM1bn cash injection to save the company from collapse. The subsidiary, which was taken over in 1986 and operates some of the most modern and low-cost manufacturing sites in the group, lost DM180m last year on sales of DM10bn. The need for an investigation adds to the burdens of Mr Piech, who is already weighed down by a clash with General Motors of the US over allegations of industrial espionage. He is also battling to restore his personal credibility, having had to back away from earlier promises that the struggling VW automotive group would return to profit this year. Whatever the findings of the audit, VW appears to have little alternative but to step in with a salvage operation. VW lost DM1.6bn in the first half. However the supervisory board has said it expected a positive result in the third quarter for the German parent and the group as a whole.

0,FT934-4292 ,"FT934-4292 _AN-DLEAMAB5FT 931204   FT  04 DEC 93 / The curse of Gyllenhammar: Kevin Done and John Ridding sift through the wreckage of the failed merger between Renault and Volvo      By KEVIN DONE and JOHN RIDDING   Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar is leaving Volvo for the wilderness like a baleful Old Testament prophet cursing his people. Left in isolation by his shareholders and his senior management, he is prophesying only the apocalypse for his abandoned flock. The Volvo organisation is 'crushed', the company 'wounded'. The critics of his vision are guilty of 'turning their backs on Europe and the world' and have 'reduced the probability of Volvo's long-term survival'. The rejection of a full merger of Renault and Volvo's automotive operations was also a rejection of all that had been achieved in the last three years of alliance between the Swedish and French automakers, he claimed. In his most damning imprecation Mr Gyllenhammar warned: 'The alliance will not remain. It will be dismantled by a Renault management which has lost its confidence in Volvo. To dissolve the alliance will require time, energy and will be demoralising.' Yesterday Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault and the man who shared Mr Gyllenhammar's vision for building Europe's second-largest vehicle maker, was understandably more cautious. 'The industrial agreement signed with Volvo in 1990 remains in force. It is not threatened by the failure of the merger,' he insisted. 'But the dynamism has been lost. We have to look with sangfroid at what we do now. We will examine our projects on a case by case basis.' In reality the choices facing Mr Schweitzer - and Mr Gyllenhammar's successors at Volvo - are bleak. The challenges and threats in the fiercely competitive global automotive industry, which first encouraged the two companies to look at merger as a road to survival in the next century, remain. The world's car and commercial vehicle makers are haunted by overcapacity, minimal growth in demand, continuous upward pressure on product development costs, increasing price competition, and the need to overhaul radically their components and materials supplier bases in order to reduce components costs. To make matters worse, the auto industry is still caught in the worst recession in Europe and Japan of the postwar era. Much of the industry is in loss, and those parts still in profit are scarcely making enough money to support the demands for ever increasing investment. Instead of confronting these external threats Renault and Volvo must now turn aside and use invaluable management time and resources to unpick their relationship. Outright merger had always been the only logical conclusion of the far-reaching alliance announced by the two companies in 1990 and formalised with an exchange of large minority cross shareholdings at the beginning of 1991. The two companies must now examine what can be saved from their collaborative projects, and assess which activities have been rendered impossible by the breakdown of trust between the organisations, and which areas may lend themselves to collaboration with other rivals. Some joint activities will still make sense outside the remit of a full merger. The world auto industry is a complicated square dance in which the big players co-operate in some regional markets of the world and compete in others. The exchange of major components such as engines and gearboxes is becoming increasingly common. Renault already supplies engines and transmissions for the Volvo 400 series. Projects such as this will probably survive. In doubt, however, will be the future of the ambitious plans that had been put into place in preparation for full merger. These include the establishment of common operations for purchasing and quality, the merger of car marketing and sales organisations in big markets such as Germany, and the creation of single project teams for the development of new model ranges, such as the joint executive car planned for the end of the decade to replace the Volvo 800/900 series and the Renault Safrane. If a full divorce occurs, it would leave the Volvo car operations looking particularly exposed. Mr John Longhurst, automotive analyst for UBS, warned that Volvo's shareholders had won 'a hollow victory' by stopping the merger. 'Volvo Car will ultimately wither in the absence of the economies of scale that would only have come from a full merger.' The development without a partner of the Volvo 850, the Swedish carmaker's latest new car project, had almost 'broken' Volvo's car division, said Mr Longhurst. 'Its replacement could finish the job.' Most industry observers believe that Renault remains in a relatively healthy position without the merger. 'Volvo needed this merger much more than Renault,' said one automobile industry analyst in London. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, is confident that the car group can remain profitable throughout the worst downturn in the world automobile industry. New products are also on the way. At the beginning of next year Renault will introduce the Laguna to replace the Renault 21. A replacement for the Renault 19 is also due by 1995. But the collapse of the merger is still a blow. Renault and Volvo predicted cost savings of more than FFr30bn (Pounds 3.4bn) by 2000 as a result of economies of scale in production, combined RD efforts and joint purchasing programmes. Renault was also aiming to capitalise on Volvo's strength in upper-range cars and safety technology. From Renault's perspective, the merger was particularly important in commercial vehicles, where Volvo is stronger. 'In the trucks sector, now more than ever you have size problems,' said Mr Schweitzer. 'RD costs are growing rapidly and these are the kind of costs saved by a merger.' It seems inevitable that the process of picking up the pieces will take place in a mood of bitterness. Renault said it 'deplored' Volvo's failure to ratify the merger. 'This is an unpredictable partner,' said Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister. 'It is a missed opportunity for European industry.' Most troubling for Mr Schweitzer is the state of limbo in which the group finds itself. 'The alliance with Volvo was meant to lead to a merger and synergies between the two groups,' said one industry observer. 'Instead Renault now finds itself with an albatross around its neck.' Mr Schweitzer has consistently maintained that, without a merger, the existing co-operation would be jeopardised. 'It has always been a two-stage process,' he says. 'Co-operation has worked because we were heading towards a common goal of the merger.' For the French government, the accord was regarded as a vital step before the privatisation of its automobile group, one of the most attractive assets on the list of 21 publicly owned groups slated for sale over the next five years. Resolving the status of the alliance, and in particular the cross shareholdings, will be crucial to the privatisation. In January 1991, Volvo took 20 per cent of the shares in Renault and 45 per cent of the shares in its trucks and buses division. Renault took 25 per cent of the shares in Volvo's car operations, 45 per cent of its truck activities and about 10 per cent of the voting capital in the parent company. The French government said the failure of the merger did not affect its intention to privatise the car group, but it could hardly do so soon. 'For one thing, who would buy shares when the situation is so chaotic?' asked one merchant banker in Paris. 'Second, the French government must be nervous about the prospect of having Volvo so prominent in the share register after everything that has happened.' The result is likely to be a delay in Renault's privatisation, which may be welcomed by the government. 'It may now be able to wait for conditions in the automobile market to improve to maximise its revenues,' said Mr Philippe Barrier, automobile analyst at Societe Generale, the financial group. But the state of the car market is hardly the priority for either Renault or Volvo. Business-as-usual must take a back seat as they struggle to emerge from the wreckage of the failed merger, with Mr Gyllenhammar's prophecies ringing in their ears.   Companies:-  Volvo.

The company estimated in July that its production of cars and trucks would total 845,000 units in the quarter but it said yesterday that it expected to manufacture 775,000 units. It said the drop was not due to weaker demand for its vehicles. Analysts said the shortfall could hit its third-quarter financial results and make it harder to achieve its goal of breaking even in North America this year on an operating basis after several years of heavy losses. The problems seem due in part to the shake-up in GM's relations with parts suppliers which was set in motion last year by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the executive who quit GM earlier this year to join Volkswagen of Germany. The two companies are embroiled in a legal battle over GM's accusations that Mr Lopez and other defectors of Volkswagen took with them sensitive company documents. Mr Lopez, in an attempt to slash GM's parts purchasing costs, forced many suppliers to renegotiate contracts at short notice. Suppliers warned that this could have a knock-on effect on GM production in the model year just started. GM said yesterday that the problems could not be attributed to the cost-cutting process, 'which is sound and is working'. However, GM acknowledged that its vehicles would contain 20,000 new parts this year, significantly higher than previous years.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.

Hydro, best known for long-distance power transmission, electro-chemical and battery research, has unveiled its Couture Powertrain system, which runs on electric batteries backed up by a small gasoline engine. It has spent CDollars 22m (Pounds 9.8m) since 1991 proving technical feasibility and will spend a further CDollars 50m to reach the commercialisation phase. The hybrid traction system, designed and developed by researcher Pierre Couture, uses high-efficiency batteries to drive electric motors in each of a car's four wheels. A conventional gearbox, differential, drive shaft and gasoline engine are not needed. A small gasoline engine recharges the batteries. The whole system, including central generator-motor, is computer controlled. It has a 30hp, two-stroke gasoline engine, with a catalytic converter. The engine runs for a maximum of 30 minutes per hour of driving. Couture says the system offers twice a conventional (internal combustion engine) car's energy efficiency, reduces emissions and makes significant savings in materials. Total vehicle weight is about the same as conventional cars. Manufacturing costs could be less. Hydro is testing the technology on a standard Chrysler Intrepid sedan. Its rear wheels are driven by individual electric motors powered by batteries kept in the boot. The normal frontwheel drive system is disengaged. Many groups are working on electric cars and hybrids worldwide. Recent US research shows that better design and electronics could raise average mileage per gallon to 46, or 65 per cent, according to research, but this is likely to add Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 610) to the cost.

0,FT944-8724 ,"FT944-8724 _AN-EKREFAD6FT 941118   FT  18 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen   At DM136m, Volkswagen's third-quarter after-tax profits were only DM3m higher than they were in the previous three months. But a pronounced recovery is nonetheless under way. The DM73m loss in the full nine months compares with losses of DM1.5bn in the same period last year. The key to the earnings revival is aggressive cost-cutting, evident in virtually unchanged production costs and reduced sales and administrative expenditure. This is impressive when turnover was up 4.1 per cent to DM58.8bn in the first nine months. But VW still faces a major cost headache. Analysts predict that even if rationalisation continues at the current pace, the net profit margin will only reach 2.6 per cent by 1996 - lower than for other European volume producers and half the level achieved by the big US manufacturers. The crunch will come when VW renegotiates the four-day working week which runs out next year. Sharply reduced 'other income' yesterday suggests that the group has made higher provisions. If these are used to cut staff aggressively, so much the better. Shareholders must assume that their interests will always be secondary to those of the government of Lower Saxony, which, as VW's largest shareholder, is concerned more with politics than profits. However, even if VW does not become as lean as its European and US competitors, there is scope for a strong improvement in profits later in the decade as sales start to climb rapidly in response to new models and economic recovery. It may be that earnings per share will recover to more than DM100 at the cyclical peak, in which case the shares are cheap at yesterday's price of DM455.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

We assumed it was a postpartum mood swing, but we were astounded to  discover that the cause of her outburst was not sleep deprivation or feeding  woes. It was fleas.    Seems she'd bought her older child a puppy, an irresistible ball of fluff who,  it turned out, had an equally irresistible flea population.    My initial reaction was, why the tears? Just call an exterminator, or buy some  of those flea bombs and zap everything in sight. But before I even opened my  mouth I realized what a bad idea that was.

He's a junior entomologist,  with a room full of forbidding-looking specimens in jars and display cases. He  had read in a bug club bulletin about a natural way to get rid of fleas and  proceeded to demonstrate.    First, he set out a shallow pan, like a baking pan, and filled it with water to  which he added some liquid soap. Next to it he placed a goose-necked lamp,  arranged so the light shone into the water. He explained that fleas are  attracted by heat and light, and they can't swim when the surface tension of  the water is broken by soap.    By leaving his contraption in the middle of a flea-infested room at night, the  bugs are attracted by the lamp, causing them to jump into the water and drown.    Well, we were skeptical, but Randee was desperate, so she tried it. The next  day, she called up to report that her first attempt resulted in a container  full of dead fleas. By repeating the experiment for a week, she got the flea  problem under control -- without having to bail out of the house.    Meanwhile, another bug crisis broke out, this time in our kitchen, where  someone (accusing fingers were pointed, but no guilty party was found) let a  half-eaten peach rot behind the stove. By the time the offending peach had been  found, the kitchen was full off fruit flies.

He energetically sawed the bottle through the middle. When  he was done, he poured some honey-water into the bottom half (he said any sweet  liquid would do) and stuck the inverted top half, spout pointing downward, into  the bottom half.    This, he announced, was a fly trap. Sure enough, the next morning the thing was  full of fruit flies. They had gone down the spout to get at the honey-water,  and then couldn't figure out how to get out again.    This set me to thinking.

0,FT931-806 ,"FT931-806 _AN-DC1AGAEIFT 930327   FT  27 MAR 93 / Motoring: Ouch] Take that, Rolls-Royce      By STUART MARSHALL   THE HANDFUL of rich men who run Rolls-Royces on their businesses are going to be clobbered by the new company car tax rules. It is hard for ordinary mortals to feel too badly about the fact that they are going to have to pay anything from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000 a year in extra income tax. Most of them will still have an awful lot of spending money left. But the effect on Rolls-Royce Motors and the shrinking band of craftsmen it employs is potentially dire. Unless, that is, changes can be made to the Finance Bill which will give effect to the chancellor's Budget proposals while it goes through the House of Commons. Rolls-Royce Motors is not in the best of financial health. Last year, it sold 1,378 Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars - 380 of them, nearly all to companies, in Britain - compared with the 3,000-plus world-wide in the loadsamoney days of the mid to late 1980s. And it is reckoned to have made a loss of about Pounds 25,000 on each car sold in 1992. Having shed nearly 1,000 workers earlier this year in a bid to be slim enough to be profitable while making only 1,378 cars a year, the thought of the Budget denying it even a single home market sale is unappealing. So, the lobbying has started. In badgering MPs to support a better tax deal for megabuck motorists, Rolls-Royce will, at least, have the moral support of Mercedes-Benz UK. The man who runs a Mercedes-Benz 600SEL (list price Pounds 88,600) on his company will see the taxman's take go up from Pounds 3,720 now to Pounds 4,018 next year, and then more than double to Pounds 8,272 in tax year 1994-5. That apart, Mercedes-Benz and all the other purveyors of full ranges of luxury and executive cars, such as Jaguar, Daimler and BMW, have greeted the Budget with relief. Even, in the case of Jaguar, with enthusiasm. It calculates that the vast majority of its customers will do rather well out of it - which, of course, means it will, too. This is all because the formula based on both engine capacity and price is to be replaced by one based on list price only. Here is how the sums add up. A 40 per cent taxpayer who drives a Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.6 (list price Pounds 25,700) between 2,000 and 18,000 business miles a year now pays Pounds 2,300 tax on the benefit. Under the new rules, this goes up to Pounds 2,484 next year and then drops to Pounds 2,399 in 1994-95. The user-chooser with a Mercedes-Benz 190D 2.5 will do better still. From the present Pounds 2,300, the tax charge rises to Pounds 2,481 from the fifth of next month and then falls by Pounds 467 to Pounds 2,017 in 1994. One can see why Rolls-Royce - and, to a lesser extent, Mercedes-Benz UK - are crying for a cap to be put on taxable car values at, say, Pounds 60,000. Rolls-Royce feels the loss of revenue would be insignificant but implies that the loss to the United Kingdom if tax sounded the marque's death knell would be enormous. All Jaguars, except for the Pounds 46,600 XJ12, will attract 1994-95 tax penalties lower than those for 1993-94 by between Pounds 39 (the XJ6 3.2) and Pounds 880 (XJS 4.0 coupe). A Jaguar XJ12 user will have to pay another Pounds 333. But a jubilant Roger Putnam, Jaguar's sales and marketing director, says this is substantially less than a similar imported V12 (he means a BMW 750i or 850i or a Mercedes-Benz 600SE or 600SL) would cost the customer. The chancellor's decision to increase company car tax scale charges by 8 per cent has gone down less well. It means the driver of a just under two-litre Rover 800 will pay an additional Pounds 88 a year. On the other hand, drivers of fuel-saving and environmentally friendly diesel cars like the Pounds 17,995 Peugeot 605SLDT, Pounds 18,435 Citroen XM Turbo or Pounds 18,595 Rover 825D will gain substantially. They have been hard hit by having to pay roughly double the tax of their petrol-powered counterparts simply because the engines of their vehicles broke the two-litre cylinder capacity band by a few measly cubic centimetres. Now, they will pay the same. Full marks, they will say, to the chancellor for ending a flagrant injustice; but only two cheers for not increasing the price differential between unleaded petrol and diesel fuel. They find this hard to square with his declared aim of using higher fuel prices to reduce energy consumption and air pollution. Modern diesel cars use up to 30 per cent less fuel and put less muck into the atmosphere even than petrol cars with exhaust catalysers. Yet, diesel prices at the pump, in spite of a marginally lower rate of duty, remain obstinately about the same as those of unleaded petrol. Barring Switzerland, where diesel is actually 1.5p a litre dearer than unleaded petrol, every other European country encourages diesel cars with cheaper fuel - by as much as 19p a litre in France and 18p in Holland. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the car-makers' mouthpiece in Britain, thought it really had got the diesel car message across to government this year. But it believes one expert adviser who has the chancellor's ear does not like diesel cars and is more inclined to put in the boot than a good word. Perhaps next year . . .

The possibility arose yesterday after a televised claim that a female VW employee had said she and nine colleagues had been instructed to store material by an assistant to Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's new production director, and the man at the centre of the investigation. The woman, allegedly already interrogated, had apparently said nothing about the origins of the material when questioned. However, she reportedly told a third party that the documents carried an Opel logo. Mr Georg Nauth, a senior prosecutor and spokesman for the investigators, said the reports would be checked. It is understood several witnesses from VW, under questioning, have said they could not remember - or could not rule out - whether material they handled bore marks identifying their origins as either Opel or GM. Mr Walter Hiller, a member of the VW supervisory board, said yesterday the board had been 'credibly assured' at a meeting last Friday that an internal investigation at VW found there was no such material in the group's data banks. The meeting unanimously backed Mr Lopez and said there was no evidence to warrant accusations of industrial espionage. Meanwhile, Opel threatened further legal action if VW did not tell it in precise detail the nature and contents of material destroyed in the week of March 22 on instructions of Mr Lopez.

They rose 5 per cent to 65,500. The British Aerospace subsidiary also increased its worldwide sales by 13 per cent in the period - helped by a 44 per cent sales rise in Japan, where the new-car market is suffering the first notable reverse in its history. Rover's Japanese sales rise is from a small base - up from 4,300 to 6,200 - but Rover executives see it as cause for further celebration following Honda's decision to sell the Land Rover Discovery model in Japan badged as a Honda - the first time a western manufacturer's model has received such an endorsement. Helped by sharp increases in other export markets outside Europe, Rover's total sales in the first half rose to 202,100 from 178,300 in the same period a year ago. UK sales were up 14 per cent, at 119,700, and export sales were 12 per cent higher at 82,400. Rover's total export sales outside Europe were up 54 per cent, to 16,900 units. The increase in continental European sales came in the face of estimates from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association last week that the combined total sales in 17 west European markets were down by 17.5 per cent in the first half of the year. In spite of the collapse in the German new-car market, where sales were down more than 20 per cent in the first half, Rover increased its sales in Germany by 6 per cent and plans to double the size of its German dealer network over the next two years.

I find it surprising that Mr Wiltshire should consider it a sad conclusion of the deal that the Rover 800 replacement will be based on a BMW platform. What is so terrible about using a platform from a motor company recognised as building the finest chassis in the world? Moreover, he believes that, as a consequence, the RD work on this model will be concentrated in Germany. He overlooks the fact that no fewer than three of Rover's model ranges (200/400,600 and 800) are based on Honda platforms, yet the Rover versions were not developed in Japan. And it is wrong to suggest BMW is interested only in Land Rover. BMW is buying Rover for its expertise in smaller, front-wheel-drive vehicles - an example of how technology will flow both ways in this deal. Mr de Looze asserts three Rover models are 'overdue for replacement' (800, 200/400, and the Metro). While few would dispute this in the case of the Metro, sales of the 200/400 and 800 suggest car buyers disagree. It is regrettable Rover is to pass out of British ownership. But it would have been sadder had it continued to suffer the indifference, incompatibility and restricted investment offered by BAe. Mr Wiltshire threatens to stop buying Rover cars. Is this the best way to help Rover's 33,000 British employees? Simon Bates, Cathedral Court, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

He was being kept informed on the bitter dispute over the alleged theft of data and possible industrial espionage by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the new VW production director. But the minister was 'no longer active', a spokeswoman said yesterday. 'Nothing has changed, and when there is no willingness, then it is just a waste of time,' she added. It is understood there are no plans for any further contacts with either side. Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, Mr Rexrodt's personal spokesman, said recently that the minister's aim had been to try to prevent damage to political and business relations between the US and Germany and to find a way for the two companies 'to work together sensibly'. Political observers said yesterday that, by leaving the legal investigation and the row to run their natural courses, Mr Rexrodt has withdrawn from an fast-moving, unpredictable situation in which he was ill-advised to intervene in the first place. He was drawn into the fray by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, after Opel said it would agree to written exchanges with the VW chief if he publicly retracted statements that the US group was conducting a 'war' with the intention of 'defaming' Volkswagen. However, Mr Piech was prepared only to offer not to repeat his accusations. The minister last met Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, on August 26 in Frankfurt, the same day public prosecutors raided and searched VW headquarters and the homes of Mr Lopez and seven of his colleagues.

Prospects of a deal, which could end one of the legal battles between the groups, emerged after private negotiations in the back room of a Frankfurt court yesterday. An open-court hearing, called to consider an appeal from Opel, the General Motors subsidiary, that seven former GM group employees should be banned from working at VW for a year, was adjourned after presiding judge, Mr Heinz Traub, recommended that the two sides should look for a compromise. An earlier attempt by Opel to win a temporary banning injunction was turned down because, the court decided, the seven had been drawn to VW by the 'charisma' of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM executive who defected to VW in March. Further evidence has since emerged to support Opel's claim that Mr Lopez and colleagues systematically poached key GM group employees. Volkswagen is still bound by a separate injunction not to continue this practice. Under orders from Judge Traub to keep strictly silent or risk endangering the outcome, neither company would discuss yesterday's deal. It is believed that three or four of the seven, including Mr Jorge Manuel Gutierrez, head of VW production and Mr Lopez's closest colleague, may be suspended if the companies' boards approve before the end of this week - a deadline set by Mr Traub. Criminal investigations into suspicions that Mr Lopez, Mr Gutierrez and colleagues stole secret GM data before leaving for VW, are continuing.

The closure of the sprawling Zona Franca factory, on Barcelona's city outskirts, has been widely expected as Seat tumbled into losses which are expected to reach Pta100bn (Pounds 505.05m) this year. At the end of last month Seat's chairman, Mr Jose Antonio Diaz Alvarez, resigned when Volkswagen rejected as inadequate his scheme to cut 5,000 jobs at Zona Franca. Over the past three weeks the German group has been unsuccessfully lobbying the Spanish government in the hope that the administration would ease its burden through an injection of public money. Union leaders are due to meet in Barcelona today to co-ordinate what are likely to be big protests. Volkswagen's job cuts represents the biggest single labour shakeout in Spain's industrial history, as well as one of the most emotive. The Zona Franca plant, where Seat began producing cars in 1951, is held as emblematic of Spain's post-war economic recovery. Unions were told that the German group intended to shift production of the Toledo model from Zona Franca to Martorell, a Pta244bn plant that opened earlier this year and which will now become the main production centre of the group's Spanish unit. Production of the Marbella and the Terra models, which are also built at the Barcelona plant, would be transferred to Volkswagen's subsidiary in Mexico. Under Volkswagen's plan 1,700 Seat employees on short term contracts, will be made redundant with immediate effect, while 3,000 workers over 55 years old will be offered early retirement schemes. Jobs will be suspended for a further 4,300 Zona Franca workers.   Companies:-  Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo.     Volkswagen.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

The production facilities, due to open in mid-1996, are expected to turn out 100,000 vehicles a year. The Bavarian site was awarded the production contract after a group-wide competition in which the Seat works in Martorell, the Skoda factory in the Czech Republic - both offering far lower labour costs than in Germany - and VW's plant in Brussels were also short-listed, the company said yesterday. Ingolstadt's advantages included lower start-up investment costs and greater flexibility, Audi added. The local workforce had also accepted changes in working practices and reduced benefit payments which alone would save DM150m a year. 'We have proved Audi can make top-quality cars at competitive costs,' claimed Mr Herbert Demel, who was named board spokesman last Friday after the sacking of Audi chairman, Mr Franz-Josef Kortum. Mr Demel said he expected the company to break even this year following losses in 1993 estimated at more than DM200m. The new car, the Audi-A, based on the VW Golf chassis, is an integral part of a plan laid by VW group chairman Ferdinand Piech, who was head of Audi until the end of 1992, to widen the brand's product range. Cheaper than the current bottom-of-the-range Audi 80, it is intended to attract younger buyers to the marque, which at present sells mainly to the over-40s.

The Mexican government said the total investment would be about Dollars 600m (Pounds 410.9m), although it appears this sum will include investment by car parts suppliers brought to Mexico by BMW. The government said the plant would be ready from the middle of next year, and would be based in the state of Mexico, near Mexico City. It is expected to create about 1,600 jobs. An official said BMW 'is not going to invest a lot in its own plant, since it will be mainly assembling cars for the luxury market'. The move follows an earlier BMW decision to build a car plant in South Carolina in the US. Mr Eduardo Henkel, head of BMW Mexico, said the company would export assembled cars from Mexico, principally to Central and South America. The car producer is expected to buy parts from Mexico for its planned plant in South Carolina, thereby circumventing current restrictions on the amount of local content required for Mexican cars. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement Mexico has agreed to relax requirements for a given Mexican content for vehicle parts, and to reduce tariffs for US and Canadian parts. The liberalisation of the car sector should eventually enable BMW to integrate its US and Mexican operations. Mr Horst Teltschik, a BMW director, said the company was attracted to Mexico by the economy's strength and by opportunities offered by Nafta. Mercedes-Benz recently began assembling luxury cars in the country. Mexico's principal carmakers are Volkswagen, Nissan, and the US big three, Chrysler, General Motors and Ford.

On that basis, it is extremely difficult to judge whether Fiat will earn a decent return on capital now being sunk into the business. The worry is that there is little in the capital-raising package to suggest that Fiat has changed its spots. The involvement of outside investors such as Deutsche Bank and Alcatel Alsthom might be taken as comforting. That said, Deutsche picked up its existing shares near the top of the market in 1986, which says little for its judgment of underlying value. On the surface, the planned sale of Fiat's 58 per cent stake in Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer, marks a welcome step back from the empire-building of the past. Yet the convoluted plan to sell the stake to Ifil, one of Fiat's main shareholders, is no substitute for a clean break. The suspicion remains that such changes have been forced on Fiat by circumstance. It would be more encouraging to see an infusion of new blood among top management instead of the old guard postponing retirement. Fiat's predicament stems from the poor performance of its automotive business during the late 1980s, during a period of unwise diversification. Raising equity is a remedy for the current financial headache, but it will not prevent a re-run.   Companies:-  Fiat.     La Rinascente.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.

0,FT932-5405 ,"FT932-5405 _AN-DFCCOAGBFT 930603   FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (9): A force to be reckoned with / Profile of Hyundai Motors      By TONY JACKSON   HYUNDAI MOTORS is one of the success stories of Korean industry. Its name is one of the very few Korean brands known to western consumers. It makes more than half the cars on Korean roads. It is perhaps the only Korean car maker capable of holding its own in world markets. But Hyundai's success is, like so much else in the Korean economy, the product of government planning. Japanese cars are banned entirely from the Korean market and other foreign cars carry prohibitive tariffs. In 1981, the government decreed that passenger cars should be made by only two companies, Hyundai and Daewoo. Given those two factors and a tenfold increase in Korean car ownership in the past decade, it would have been hard for Hyundai to fail. The going is getting tougher. According to Mr Don Lee, motors analyst at BZW in Seoul, growth in the Korean car market this year could be a mere 11 per cent, after an average 40 per cent in the previous five years. And the government has relaxed restrictions on other Korean companies entering the market. The total is now seven, a number which in the long run is plainly insupportable. Most worrying for Hyundai is the fact that Samsung, perhaps the most formidable of all the big Korean conglomerates, may also soon be allowed to make cars. But Hyundai is a force to be reckoned with. Like all the other Korean car makers, it has historically depended on Japanese technology. But this is changing. Uniquely among Korean manufacturers, Hyundai has reached the stage of making its own engines. According to Mr Lee Chung-Goo, vice-president and chief engineer of Hyundai Motor, Hyundai is technologically self-sufficient, except for engines and transmissions made under licence from Mitsubishi. But its new family of engines, the Alpha range, has already been introduced into one model, the Scoupe. The target is to put Alpha engines into the rest of the range by 1995. Nevertheless, Hyundai is some way off matching Japanese standards. In the US market, its cars are a byword for poor quality, chiefly because of disruptive union disputes at its Korean plant in the late 1980s. 'I'm not satisfied with our efficiency', Mr Lee says. 'Our union problems started from 1986 and our workmanship is still not as good as it was before then. Previously, the workforce had a hungry spirit. Now they think they can get by, so they're not so accurate as they were in assembly work. Rejects are still much worse than in 1986.' Meanwhile, he says, the Japanese have not been standing still. 'On hardware and the lines themselves, we have invested in higher productivity, and our latest plant is very close to Japanese levels. But though our average quality standards are not so far from the Japanese, the tolerance is too big. So customers complain. We need a campaign in the plant to improve that.' Another crucial advantage enjoyed by Japanese carmakers is their domestic supply of components. This is not merely a matter of quality and innovation. Component supply is central to the Japanese system of lean manufacture whereby inventories are squeezed out of the system and costs held down. 'We have many disadvantages when it comes to sub-contractors', Mr Lee says. 'According to Japanese studies, even if a manufacturer like Hyundai could catch up with the Japanese, their sub-contractors are 10 or 20 years behind. The big developments of the future will be in electronic components. Japan has suppliers like Nippondentsu and Hitachi - big companies which can support the RD. In Korea there are almost none. In things like navigation systems, the Japanese sub-contractors are ahead of the manufacturers. No Korean company is even thinking in those terms.' At present, Mr Lee claims, only 2 per cent of the value of Hyundai cars is imported. 'But I'm worried about the future. Most Korean suppliers are close to Japanese standards in hardware terms, but not in terms of human resources. Their organisation and systems may appear close to Japanese standards, but they are behind in management terms, especially when it comes to quality levels.' Despite the problems, Hyundai has ruled out the idea of manufacturing abroad. Its plant at Ulsan, on Korea's south-east coast, is the biggest single vehicle manufacturing complex in the world. The area - some 4.8m square metres - is now fully occupied. In three years, Mr Lee says, more capacity will be needed. Within the next month or so, the decision will be made on where to put it. It will certainly be in Korea. There are several reasons for this. The Korean market is of paramount importance, as are - for better or worse  - the existing links with suppliers. And a new plant will be for a new model, which as a matter of principle will be tried first on the Korean market. And, says Mr Lee, there is a cultural reason. 'The Koreans are hot and emotional people, as opposed to the Japanese who are cold and analytical. That can lead to management problems in working overseas.' Hyundai's one experience of overseas manufacture has been traumatic. In 1983 it set up an assembly plant at Bromont in Canada. As a way into the US market, it proved wildly premature. According to outside estimates, the plant is now working at only 30 per cent of capacity. 'The Bromont story hasn't been happy', Mr Lee says. 'We're presently investing in China, Thailand and Egypt. But these will probably be joint ventures where we supply parts only. In Europe and America, it will take a long time. China has cheap labour and market growth. In Europe, labour costs are higher,and the management needs to be different in philosophical terms from the Oriental model.' All the while, there is the recurring threat of excess competition in the Korean market. 'In my personal opinion', says Mr Lee, 'while Japan has reconstructed its industry through quasi-mergers, Korea is going the opposite way. That's very dangerous. I don't think mergers will be possible. All the manufacturers are from strong groups, and the owners all have strong characters. And while in the past the government could force mergers, with democracy that's harder than before.' There is another, more radical threat. Cars are one of about 30 items covered by the Korean government's so-called Import Diversification Policy, which is a polite term for banning Japanese goods from the Korean market. This is officially justified by reference to Korea's chronic trade imbalance with Japan. In reality, it has more to do with the deep-seated fear that in free market conditions Japan, the old colonial power, would re-establish its dominance by economic means. The government's economic advisers argue that this is incompatible with Korea's membership of the international free trade system, and that the barriers will have to be dismantled within the next few years. How politically realistic this is remains to be seen. But, as Mr Don Lee of BZW says: 'in terms of technology and global competitiveness this is a very important time. The Korean car companies have to develop their own technology and improve their overseas marketing in the next couple of years if they're to compete globally. Hyundai is going that way. As for the other companies, I'm very concerned.'   Companies:-  Hyundai Motor.   Countries:-  KRZ  South Korea, Asia.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

0,FT934-12739 ,"FT934-12739 _AN-DJYCQAE6FT 931025   FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (14): Managers to blame / Interview with Ferdinand Piech of Volkswagen      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES   FERDINAND PIECH, chairman of the loss-making Volkswagen group, has disturbed many within the conservative German corporate establishment by his manners and way of doing business. But one habit of his in particular sets teeth on edge from Hamburg to Munich. He insists on saying repeatedly that only 20 per cent of industry's problems stem from the labour force and that the rest is down to management. He claims that VW is in a mess because the group's previous management 'failed to do its homework'. The inference is that the same applies elsewhere in Germany. Piech's beliefs have led him to see himself as 'a coach for the protagonists on the shopfloor'. He argues that management should encourage labour to play its part in the restructuring of Standort Deutschland by transforming the way ordinary workers look at their jobs. At VW the process is under way partly through the application of the established Japanese-based continuous improvement process, generally known as CIP, but known at VW headquarters in Wolfsburg as KVP-squared. The squared element in the formulation reflects the sense of urgency which Piech wants to instil in his labour force. He says that the company, which lost DM1.6bn in the first six months of this year alone, has two or three years to match Japanese quality and productivity. He brims with missionary zeal. 'I am very little in my office. Most of the time I'm out in the plant. I am not there as an engineer. I'm looking on, seeing what's going right and what's wrong,' he says. Piech is quite open about his relationship with labour. His biggest shareholder is the Social Democrat/Green coalition government of Lower Saxony. The VW supervisory board which gave him the job is dominated by trade union and Social Democrat interests. 'If I have to reduce labour costs I cannot do it without their co-operation. I have to do it in a way in which they can survive, I can survive, the company can survive,' he says. He puts his fingertips together: 'It's a pyramid. If the lower level doesn't believe in me, the higher level cannot trust me.' Pyramid-building started on a trip to Japan in company with Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony, and a member of the supervisory board. 'I showed him Toyota's Lexus plant - you don't need to be a technician to understand when something is wrong. I asked him to count how many people he could see working.' Out of around 200, Schroder saw one idle man. 'Go through any one of our European plants and you will see between a half and a third of the labour standing around. And I can explain it]' Piech wriggles with agitation. 'It's not the fault of the workforce: it's our western organisation that's wrong. These people are not supplied with the things and the means to work efficiently. 'It's disorganisation - macro-computerisation of things that don't work.' He has not been impressed by preceding VW boards' investment in automation. 'It is wrong for management to believe so deeply that automation, computers and systems can help you overcome lack of competitiveness,' he declares. 'You have to organise and allow small groups of people to organise themselves, their logistics  .. everything.' At Honda, he adds, logistics costs amount to 0.5 per cent of group sales. At Audi, where he was boss until last January, the proportion was 5.5 per cent. Given the chance, he says, he could convince even Chancellor Kohl, who 'talks as though German labour does not work'. He could show him places where for every four persons 'working' another one is running around keeping them supplied with parts. He moves swiftly on to deal with another of German industry's betes noires: absenteeism. The standard Japanese rate is 2 to 3 per cent compared with around 9 per cent at VW in normal circumstances. (It has fallen to 4 per cent now as concern about unemployment has swept the labour force). Once again, the fault lies with management, which forgets that factory workers are human beings. As a result, motivation goes haywire. 'They think we treat them like electrical appliances - plugging them in and unplugging them as and where we like,' he says. A man or a woman ordered to a new, unfamiliar place on the line will tend to feel stressed. 'Six hours later they'll have disappeared.' Now, he says, people fearful for their jobs are coming to work even though they are clearly unwell. 'We have to find a way to restore normal motivation so they stay at home if they are sick and come in if they are not,' he adds. Piech, an engineer confronting the toughest turn-round challenge in Germany, promulgates his philosophies with the fervour of the newly-converted. Company officials say the new approach has already led to DM700m in real savings. But it will be some time before these show up on the bottom line. A loss of DM1.25bn at the group's Spanish subsidiary, Seat, has crushed all hopes of break-even this year. And now management is in talks with the German workers' councils to prepare for possible production cuts for next. The favoured means is by introducing short-time working - a euphemism for stopping production for as long as it takes to restore balance between output, stocks and demand for cars. Current plans, approved by Piech's political and union partners, allow for a reduction of around 13 per cent in the German workforce in the two years to the end of 1994. The jobs are being shed by natural wastage and early retirement schemes. Management proposals for more radical measures are unlikely to be welcomed by the supervisory board or the workforce, on whom Piech so much depends for success.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

Smaller lenders have an irritating habit of getting in the way of rescue proposals that appear socially and politically sensible, but then those without an axe to grind can see the financial traps more easily. The Dutch banks are so deeply involved they would prefer not to leave room for second thoughts about the medium term rescue plan. On any objective measure, Daf's position was precarious enough to warrant doubts. An operating loss last year of Fl 200m with provisions for restructuring on top would have cut deeply into capital and reserves which stood at Fl 810m at the end of 1991. Lenders clearly faced a transformation of debt into equity. The activities of the group's financing subsidiary made it all the more legitimate to worry that the same might have happened to any new loans extended. Daf Finance was responsible for a large part of the Fl 3.5bn of short term debt on the group's last balance sheet. But the quality of its loan book must have deteriorated with the recession in the UK and the downturn in continental Europe. That problem only made rescuing the industrial activities more difficult. Nor was Daf a natural survivor in the commercial vehicle market. It is too small and too dependent on the UK. The logical answer might have been an alliance, but a partner's first job would have been to pay to take out capacity. The rest of the European industry must be sighing with relief now that this cost looks like falling squarely on the shoulders of Daf's own lenders and shareholders.

They said manufacturers searching for ways of increasing competitiveness normally had relatively little difficulty keeping them in-house thanks to the industry's 'confidentiality clause' contract system. Engineers, senior managers and others with access at an early stage to new model programmes, investment and technology strategies have these clauses written into their contracts - and few have been known to abuse them. 'The reason is fairly obvious in the case of anyone whose career is in the industry,' one UK motor industry executive who wished to remain anonymous said last night. 'There might be a short-term gain for someone moving confidential information from one company to another. But in the long-term? What does that engineer or executive do if he or she wants or needs to make another move? The word would have got around about what had happened. Put simply, there would be nowhere else in the industry for that person to go.' The system has also survived substantial change in the organisation and processes of the industry which have meant that many more people than even five years ago necessarily have knowledge of key projects and strategies at an early stage. 'The days when a car maker's board had all the good ideas and took decisions behind closed doors has gone,' said another. 'If it's a significant project, it will involve the use of a centralised computer database and require information and input at an early stage from people in middle management, engineers and similar.'

Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, said 'some especially interesting' proposals had been put forward from regional authorities. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the German group's Basque-born production director who recently defected from General Motors, campaigned fiercely at GM for his so-called Plateau 6 plant to be built in his homeland, where he retains strong political connections. The US group's refusal, and its preference for any future investments to be made in eastern Europe where costs are far below those in any European Community country, are understood to be the main reasons for his stormy departure from Detroit in March. Seat's statement yesterday, following the announcement that Mr Lopez is to hold press conferences in Hanover and Madrid next Monday, were widely seen as signalling confirmation that VW had accepted his proposals. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, told shareholders last week that the group was planning a new plant to build a cheap 'people's car'. He did not say where or when. Mr Piech, who recently ordered that development of a brand-new plant in Mosel, eastern Germany, should be slowed because of industry-wide over-capacity and the worst market slump since the war, said the people's car could only be built in a new plant. Plateau 6 is a concept developed partly by Mr Lopez while he was at GM. It involves the assembly of cars from modules mainly shipped from outside suppliers, and installed by their staff.

Mr Peter Ward, Rolls-Royce chairman and chief executive and Vickers managing director, operations, refused to confirm the specific talks with the German carmaker, but said: 'We are in a number of discussions.' Mercedes-Benz said that Rolls-Royce had approached it a year ago for talks about engine supply for a new generation of products and said that discussions were continuing. Mr Ward said that Rolls-Royce was 'looking at a number of possibilities and partners, but we are not yet close to reaching a conclusion'. An eventual move by Rolls-Royce to purchase engines from Mercedes-Benz would represent a significant departure for the company, which assembles its own 6.75 litre V8 engines at its plant at Crewe, Cheshire. The current engines used in Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are derived from an original 6.25 litre V8 engine launched by the company in 1958, although the engines have since been substantially updated. Rolls-Royce says that its latest engine range meets worldwide emissions standards to the year 2000. The Mercedes-Benz 6 litre V12 was launched in 1991 in its S-Class model. It produces about 8,500 V12 engines a year. Rolls-Royce and Bentley production was 1,263 last year. Rolls-Royce is seeking collaboration agreements with other carmakers to help to finance the development of future model generations. Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers chief executive, said earlier this year that Rolls-Royce did not have the financial resources to develop a new model generation alone. It planned to evolve the present models but would need some form of partnership in the second half of the 1990s.   Companies:-  Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.     Mercedes-Benz.

When it is complete the VSAT (very small aperture terminal) network will be by far the largest in Europe with several thousand terminals. As many as 300 dealers are to be linked to the network within the next year mainly in the eastern part of Germany where the telecommunications infrastructure is poor. It is believed to be the first example of a manufacturing company, as opposed to financial services groups, setting up its own VSAT network in Europe. The network will handle everything from data communications and broadcast video for staff training to credit-card verification and the provision of in-store music. After the links are established with VW dealers in eastern Germany the network will be expanded to cover dealers in the rest of Germany and then across Europe. VSAT networks are common in the US and by the end of last year more than 100,000 terminals had been installed worldwide, adding up to a Dollars 350m (Pounds 234m) a year business. They are less common in Europe with an estimated 2,000 terminals in use, mostly in Germany. Apart from financial services they are mainly used by governments. In the Volkswagen deal Scientific-Atlanta will be the equipment provider and V-Crest Systems Europe, a wholly-owned Volkswagen subsidiary will manage the project. Scientific-Atlanta claims that VSAT networks can offer 20-30 per cent discounts on traditional land line communication. Volkswagen says in many parts of eastern Germany it is impossible to link dealers using a traditional terrestrial network. The Atlanta-based company decided to enter the European VSAT market last year mainly because of the European Union's moves towards deregulation of telecommunications markets.

The company said it wanted Spain to contribute DM820m (Pounds 328m) to fund redundancies at Seat. It claimed there were 'positive signals' that the government would make funds available and a further meeting was scheduled for next week. However, in Madrid, the industry ministry said it would only be willing to pump more money into the Barcelona-based car company for new development projects. The government also argues that its scope for providing help is limited by European Union rules. Mr Juan Ignacio Molto, secretary of state for industry, told VW representatives on Tuesday that the government was not prepared to fund redundancy packages. Excess labour was 'a problem for private sector management'. Seat plans to shed about 4,600 workers, leaving it with a workforce of around 9,500 by 1996. The company expects to end the year with losses of about DM1bn, but should become profitable again in 1995. Meanwhile, VW announced that it had had 'positive results' at company and group level in April and May but would not give details of profits. The company has already said it hopes to improve on its 1993 profit of DM71m (Pounds 28.4m) at company level this year and to break even at group level following a loss of DM1.4bn (Pounds 560m) last year. Worldwide deliveries in the first five months rose 6.1 per cent over the year before to total 1.4m units. Germany was the only market where deliveries fell - by 4.1 per cent - a fact VW blamed on weak demand there generally and poor sales at Audi.

The German vehicle maker, Europe's largest, is concerned that increasing competition in the van-like MPV sector, and adverse currency movements since the deal was signed in 1991, may make the plant less profitable. The factory is scheduled to make 190,000 MPVs a year in full production. The greenfield project, at Setubal, south of Lisbon, is the largest single foreign investment in Portugal. In full production, it is scheduled to employ 4,700 workers, and create indirectly up to another 10,000 jobs in the area. VW stressed last night there was no danger of it seeking to withdraw from or scale down the venture. The project is receiving Ecu750m (Dollars 619.8m) of EC development and training subsidies, and the Portuguese government regards it as its flagship foreign investment project. Ford of Europe, which is a 50 per cent partner with VW in the venture, last night described the Wolfsburg initiative as a 'routine' financial reassessment. It said Ford itself was not concerned about the project's viability. VW's managing board has been asked to come up with the plan in time for the supervisory board's next meeting, in November. The plant's vehicles will compete in one of the few sectors still enjoying rapid growth in Europe. Sales of multi-purpose vehicles have risen by an average 80 per cent a year since 1986, and are projected to reach 700,000 units a year by the end of the decade. However, every big vehicle maker in Europe is now planning to seek a share of this growth.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Ford of Europe.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.     PTZ  Portugal, EC.

Nissan has signed a contract with Zhengzhou Light Truck Factory to produce 30,000 one-ton pick-up trucks by 1997. The project includes an auto chair workshop and a brake system manufacturing plant. 'What had prevented us from coming earlier,' said Mr Shigeno, Nissan's Beijing manager, 'was the limited market size in China and its different economic system. Compared to the Europeans and the Americans, we were inexperienced in dealing with communist countries such as China.' The first trucks are planned to roll off the assembly line in early 1994. Nissan's investment in China contrasts with European, American and some minor Japanese auto makers. Volkswagen of Germany, Peugeot and Citroen of France, Chrysler and General Motors of the US have all set up car, mini-bus or truck assembly plants in China. Japan's Daihatsu and Suzuki have licenced mini-cars to plants in Tianjin and Chongqing. 'This year, things are different: American and European markets are saturated, Japan's domestic market slumped. But China's demand keeps growing. This is what drew us here,' said Mr Shigeno. Nissan's biggest concern is over China's market size. 'You need a market that could consume 3m units to make a profit, or it's not worth it,' said Mr Shigeno. Last year, China produced 1.08m motor vehicles including 250,000 cars, 100,000 more than the previous year. China imports 100,000 cars a year. China's gross national product growth rate exceeded 12 per cent last year and in the first quarter this year it topped 14 per cent. China is Asia's second largest auto market after Japan.

0,FT944-16688 ,"FT944-16688 _AN-EJLD6AENFT 941012   FT  12 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Chrysler cruises ahead   Of the big three US car manufacturers, Chrysler was the one deemed most likely to collapse during the last recession. But the company was so successful in responding to the crisis that it quickly evolved into investors' favoured stock in the sector. Its shares have outperformed the market by a factor of three in so many years, and the automotive sector by 100 per cent. The out-performance of Chrysler's shares, along with that of Ford and General Motors, came to a halt early this year; since then the shares have fallen back sharply amid worries about rising interest rates and the scale of recovery in the US car market. Yesterday's record third quarter results from Chrysler reflect the impact of good luck and good management - good luck because Chrysler is traditionally strong in the buoyant sports utility segment of the market, good management because of the group's success in introducing new models such as the Neon and the Grand Cherokee at the right point in the cycle. The figures also raise the question as to whether the correction in US auto share prices has been premature. True, history suggests that automotive stocks should be sold well before the cyclical peak. But that peak now looks more distant than was thought earlier. Analysts now predict the turn in US car sales will not come until well into 1996. A small further increase in interest rates will hit investor sentiment, but is not likely lead to a material downturn in sales. Thus US car manufacturers look undervalued on a multiple of six times consensus earnings for next year, a discount of more than 50 per cent to the market as a whole.   Companies:-  Chrysler Corp.

0,FT934-814 ,"FT934-814 _AN-DLVCCAFVFT 931222   FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (9): California sets the agenda - Car makers are not yet persuaded that 'green' is good for business      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Volkswagen, the car maker, keeps goldfish. They live, apparently healthy and content, in a big tank at Wolfsburg, one of Europe's largest car manufacturing plants. The water they swim in has been used in the paint plant, or in umpteen other processes before being recycled  - 'in-house' - back to cleanliness. The fish represent one of the giant German car maker's favourite illustrations of how it is managing its business with due regard for environmental considerations. Short of forming a subsidiary to sell goldfish and chips, VW in this case is nevertheless hard pushed to see the business opportunity and increased profitability which, legislators insist, should arise from sound environmental management. It is not all bad news. For example, the complex and expensive equipment which VW, General Motors and others in the motor industry have installed to collect gaseous solvents from a number of processes, and which in the past would have merely escaped into the atmosphere, does have some commercial payback. The gases can be used as a feedstock in on-site electricity generating plants, thus marginally reducing fuel bills. But in most aspects, and for the motor industry as a whole, environmental management means cost - and a lot of it. Few industries are exposed to environmental legislation and 'green' social pressures in so many forms. It is easy to see why. The motor industry is the world's single largest manufacturing activity, producing about 50m units a year of products, each containing at least 5,000 individual pieces of widely varying materials. It is a huge consumer of energy and raw materials in its production processes - and a prodigious generator, through those processes, of waste. But the products, too, are the target of environmental regulation and concern. The drive to curb exhaust emissions builds in cost and complexity from first concept on the computer to final assembly, as designers seek to accommodate increasingly more intricate catalytic converter systems and the plumbing and electronic management that goes with them. For companies such as Johnson Matthey (JM), involved in the supply of the precious metals-coated catalyst itself, there has indeed been a business opportunity as a result of Europe following North America into making 'cats' mandatory on all new cars from the start of 1993. It has meant the opening up of a whole new European market sector, for which JM fought vigorously in the 1980s propaganda wars between advocates of 'cats' and those of the seemingly rival 'lean-burn' technology (until it was realised that the technologies were in fact complementary). But for vehicle makers 'cats' have meant a significant on-cost which, though justified in environmental terms, has inevitably squeezed their profit margins in terms of how much can be passed on as higher prices to the public. Emissions-linked costs appear poised to escalate further. In North America, traditionally the leader in tightening the exhaust emissions screw, standards for 1994 will require a further 40 per cent cut in hydrocarbon emissions and a 60 per cent reduction in oxides of nitrogen compared with the previous standards. However, such big percentage cuts do not mean another big leap forward in reducing the amount of pollutants emitted compared with a car fitted with no catalyst at all. Even the relatively simple cats of five or more years ago removed 90 per cent of exhaust pollutants compared with a 'non-cat' car. The new standards are thus acting on the remaining few per cent - at what the motor industry insists, because of the technology now involved, is a similar cost to removing the initial 90 per cent. Again, the manufacturers know they cannot pass on these costs in full - or that if they did so collectively (quite apart from anti-trust considerations), higher absolute prices would reduce the size of new car markets and lead to an older - and 'dirtier' - car population as motorists hung on to their vehicles for longer. Not surprisingly, the industry's own, fruitless urging has been that the biggest immediate impact on exhaust pollution could be made by government sweeping the older car population from the streets, and perhaps providing fiscal incentives for the purchase of new ones. Instead, California has pointed the way towards yet more draconian emissions standards - and thrown another huge burden on the world's motor industry - by insisting that 2 per cent of a car maker's sales in the state must be of 'zero emission vehicles' (ZEVs) starting in 1998, rising to 10 per cent in the early 21st century, as well as requiring populations of ULEVs (ultra-low emission vehicles). Given the propensity for other US states and, eventually, other continents such as Europe to emulate California, the intended California standards are being taken seriously - not least because state legislators say non-complying manufacturers would be excluded from the Californian market altogether. Most manufacturers have interpreted the ZEV as necessarily being powered electrically - by batteries - with the exception of a few exploring hydrogen power. Thus a huge research effort into viable electric cars has been going on for the past several years. In one example of the effort, the North American 'big three' car makers, GM, Ford and Chrysler, are participants in a federal government-backed consortium spending Dollars 1.2bn in search of new batteries which might overcome the power and mileage limitations of existing types. GM is building a fleet of 50 prototypes of a car called the Impact, made mainly out of aluminium, in the hope that an electric car can be made at least faintly competitive with a petrol counterpart. But deep scepticism exists. And in terms of business opportunity the prize is not the creation of an important new market, but at best a partial substitute for the old.

The two said the combined business would have estimated sales in 1993 of about Dollars 1.2bn and would be owned 60 per cent by FMC and 40 per cent by Harsco. FMC, with interests ranging from chemicals to machinery and equipment, will put into the partnership its Defence Systems group, which employs more than 6,000 people. Its best-known product is the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, a tracked vehicle armed with automatic cannon which saw extensive action with US troops in the Gulf war. Harsco will put into the group its BMY-Combat Systems division, which employs 2,000 people and makes tracked vehicles for artillery and combat support functions. The deal is part of a trend for US defence companies to merge their activities to achieve greater efficiencies as the US defence budget shrinks following the Cold War. Mr Malcolm Gambill, chairman of Harsco, said the two businesses were a natural fit and would be a 'powerhouse in tracked vehicles'. The deal would lead to some consolidation, with the removal of unneeded higher cost capacity. The two companies have signed a letter of understanding for the combination, but still have to reach agreement on specific plans and timing. The new company will include FMC's naval systems division and its steel products division, which makes military track. However, Harsco will retain its BMY-Wheeled Vehicles division, which makes five-ton army trucks and has been suffering a dearth of orders.  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "
0,FT931-7854 ,"FT931-7854 _AN-DBVBWAE4FT 930222   FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (20): Fewer headaches - Communications Technology      By PAUL TAYLOR   IN LESS than a decade the mobile telephone has established itself as an effective business tool and a worthy addition to the company car. But over the next few years vehicle fleet managers will face the choice between a baffling array of new voice and data telecommunications services and equipment. In Europe, liberalisation has fuelled the growth of mobile communications. Since the introduction of cellular radio services in Britain in 1985, the number of subscribers to the two national networks, Cellnet and Vodafone, has grown to around 1.4m - or almost a quarter of the total 5.8m users in Europe. Most of these subscribers are business users, and an increasing proportion of them now use hand-portable telephones, most of which can be used in company cars with the addition of a car adapter kit. Standard carphones and car adapter kits now come with 'hands-free' operation and top of the range carphones also include voice-activated dialing, allowing totally hands-free use. After the boom in new subscribers in the UK in the late 1980s, the last few years have seen slower growth. Plans for telepoint services have been curtailed while other services have so far failed to live up to expectations. Nevertheless, the mobile communications market, in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, is still a fast-moving market with a new services just around the corner. In particular, across Europe digital cellular systems based on the pan-European GSM standard are currently being launched. These premium-priced services are unlikely to replace the older analogue networks immediately. Indeed, it will be some time before full national networks are in place. However, for the business traveller in particular, they will eventually offer some key advantages. Digital services will provide clearer, more reliable connections, which will also be much more secure from eavesdropping. In addition by the mid-1990s, because it is a Europe-wide standard, international travellers will be able to use their GSM phones anywhere in Europe. In the UK both network operators have introduced new low-user tariff structures for their analogue services in the past six months and Hutchison Telecom has unveiled a one-way Telepoint service called Rabbit. In addition, customers will soon be able to opt for Mercury Personal Communications' local digital Personal Communications Network (PCN) service, due to be launched by the middle of this year alongside Vodafone's rival Micro Cell Network (MCN). Already some vehicle fleet operators are inheriting a haphazard collection of equipment, service contracts and billing systems built up over the years. Indeed, research shows that many corporate users do not know how many mobile phones they have, or how they are being used. To address this problem, Mercury Communications Mobile Services, an independent service provider, now offers corporate customers a 'free audit of mobile equipment' and then a 'consolidation service.' MCMS has come across some customers with more than 300 vehicles using 20 or more different service providers. 'We can take the headache away,' says Mr Martin Bartholomew of MCMS. Managing a consolidated fleet of mobile telephones this way can have other benefits, such as providing a single point of contact for the customer, itemised billing and monitored usage. Aside from the basic cellular mobile services, many corporate customers have also signed up for the value-added services offered by network operators, such as Vodata's Recall voice messaging service or Cellnet's direct access service which provides a link between an office switchboard and the cellular network. However, some large customers, including local government and utilities, have discovered that public access mobile radio, launched in the UK in 1988, can sometimes offer significant cost advantages over cellular. Customers share a radio infrastructure built and maintained by a network operator. Once they have bought or leased their handsets there is a subscription charge only; they do not pay any call charges. Mobile data and fax transmission is another area where customer confusion is rife. There are mobile data services offered by the cellular operators, dedicated mobile data network operators, and data over private mobile radio networks. Transmitting data over an analogue cellular system is far more difficult than over the 'fixed wire' public telephone system. One way to overcome the problem is to use a special cellular modem like the one available from Vodafone's mobile data service which claims several thousand users and 90 per cent of the UK market. This enables customers to transmit and receive error-free data over the cellular network which provides any standards conversion automatically. The alternative is to use one of the dedicated mobile data services which were licensed in the UK in 1989. Hutchison Mobile Data and Ram Mobile Data Services both provide these, as does Paknet, another Vodafone subsidiary. But an obvious disadvantage of dedicated mobile data services, including paging services, is that they can only handle data, and according to research, most corporate customers require both mobile voice and data. Another problem facing mobile data customers is the lack of a worldwide standard. But this may soon be overcome in Europe with the digital GSM standard. These systems will be able handle mobile data traffic from facsimile machines or portable computers in vehicles at high speed and with comparative ease. GSM telephones equipped with small LCD screens will also be able to receive messages - like pagers - bringing the long promised digital mobile office one step closer to reality. Mobile telecommunications can also be used to cut the costs of distribution while improving customer service, vehicle security and monitoring. Satellites are also likely to play a significant role in the future of corporate mobile communications. mIn the UK, Marconi introduced Star-Track last year to trace the position of vehicles. It can be used to detect and track stolen vehicles, monitor the state of a load or direct drivers to their destination.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

0,FT942-4403 ,"FT942-4403 _AN-EFJCMAAHFT 940610   FT  10 JUN 94 / Deal close on Madrid aid for Seat      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DAVID WHITE      FRANKFURT, MADRID   Volkswagen and the Madrid government yesterday came close to an agreement in negotiations over state aid for Seat, the German vehicle group's crippled Spanish subsidiary. Further talks are scheduled next week and VW said a deal could be expected not long after that. According to a joint statement from Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and Mr Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, the Spanish industry minister, the two agreed that there should be no direct subsidies from the Spanish government for redundancies. Help would come instead in the form of support for technological projects. VW initially sought an injection of DM820m (Pounds 328m) from Spanish central and regional authorities to cover 4,600 further job cuts at Seat, reducing the company's workforce to 9,500. Other multinational motor companies manufacturing in Spain reacted sharply against the prospect of special conditions for Seat. The statement made clear that state aid would be tied to 'certain commitments' from VW and from Seat itself. It also underlined that an agreement would be aimed at 'keeping the basic elements of Seat as a company with its own capability for competing in the global market'. The still-uncertain scale of Madrid's financial commitment is crucial to VW's bid to plug the hole in VW group finances threatening for the second year in succession to sink hopes of breaking even. Seat lost DM1.8bn in 1993, was DM350m in the red in the first quarter of this year, and is heading for a further full-year deficit of DM1bn, according to company officials. VW has taken control of Seat's Pamplona factory and financial services division. The Zona Franca plant in Barcelona - subject of the current negotiations - is to be closed, leaving Seat with just one works, a new plant at Martorell.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

0," FR940304-1-00185   FR940304-1-00015        Among other things, OPA 90 introduces new safety measures relating to vessel operations. This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposes regulations to implement sections 4101(a) and (b) of OPA 90, which amend 46 U.S.C. 7101 and 7302, respectively, to require every person who applies for the issuance or renewal of a license, certificate of registry (COR), or merchant mariner's document (MMD) to have a test for dangerous drugs.    Under 46 CFR part 10, the Coast Guard issues licenses to qualified officers such as masters, mates, pilots, engineers, operators, and radio officers, and issues CORs to qualified staff officers such as pursers, medical doctors, and professional nurses.    Under the authority of 46 U.S.C. 7302, any person serving aboard most U.S.-flag merchant vessels of more than 100 gross tons operating on other than rivers and lakes must be issued an MMD by the Coast Guard. This document serves as a certificate of identification and service, authorizing work in different capacities on deck and in the engine and steward's departments. The MMD, with an appropriate endorsement, is also the credential issued to a qualified tankerman.    The statutory language of OPA 90 refers to the testing of an individual for the use of dangerous drugs in violation of law or Federal regulation. Existing Coast Guard regulations are framed around the phrase ``chemical test,'' which is already defined in 46 CFR 16.105. For the purposes of this NPRM, the chemical testing required of applicants for issuance or renewal of licenses, CORs, or MMDs relates only to the use of dangerous drugs.    Section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90 amends 46 U.S.C. 2101 by adding ``dangerous drug'' to the list of general definitions and removes the definition of dangerous drugs from 46 U.S.C. 7503(a) and 7704(a). The definition of ``dangerous drug'' in section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90 includes the term ``controlled substance.'' Although ``marijuana'' is not specifically mentioned in the new definition, marijuana is a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. 802, and is therefore covered by the definition of ``dangerous drug.'' This NPRM would revise the definition of ``dangerous drug'' in 46 CFR 16.105 to conform it to the definition in 46 U.S.C. 2101, as amended by section 4103(a)(2) of OPA 90. This change has no substantive effect on the existing drug testing rules in 46 CFR part 16.    Currently, 46 CFR 16.220(b) provides exceptions to the periodic chemical test requirement when there has been a recent test for dangerous drugs or participation in a random test program. These exceptions were revised by a final rule published in the     Federal Register     on May 28, 1993 (58 FR 31104). The revised exceptions would apply to the new testing requirements.    Section 4102(b) and (c) of OPA 90 amends 46 U.S.C. 7107 and 7302 to limit the terms of CORs and MMDs to 5 years. On September 16, 1993 the Coast Guard published an NPRM in the     Federal Register     (58 FR 48572) entitled ``Five-year Term of Validity for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents'' (CGD 91211) to implement the provisions of section 4102. Although the NPRMs for chemical testing and terms of validity both deal with the issuance and renewal of merchant mariner's credentials, two separate documents have been issued for ease of review by the public. This NPRM proposes additional changes to update Coast Guard regulations, but it does not affect the regulatory amendments contained in the ``Five-Year Term of Validity for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents'' NPRM. In two places, 46 CFR 10.805(g) and 12.029(f), this NPRM contains proposed regulatory text that would follow after additions proposed in the ``Five-Year Term of Validity for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents'' NPRM. One final rule may be issued combining the requirements for chemical testing and regulations for the terms of validity for CORs and MMDs.        Discussion of Proposed Amendments        OPA 90 requires all applicants for the issuance or renewal of licenses, CORs, or MMDs to have a chemical test for dangerous drugs. The proposed rules would apply the requirement to (1) an original issuance or a renewal of a license, COR, or MMD; (2) a raise in grade of a license or a higher grade of COR; and (3) the first endorsement on an MMD as an able seaman, qualified member of the engine department, or tankerman. Applicants meeting either of the exceptions contained in 16.220 would be exempt from the chemical testing requirements. A chemical test for dangerous drugs would not be required for an MMD endorsement that does not require a new expiration date for the MMD or the duplicate issuance or replacement of valid licenses, CORs, or MMDs. If an applicant applies for multiple documentation transactions at one time, the application is treated as a single transaction and a single drug test will satisfy the drug testing requirements for all documentation transactions covered by the application.    In a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) published in the     Federal Register     on October 17, 1989 (54 FR 42624), the Coast Guard proposed to remove existing 46 CFR subpart 12.20 entitled ``Tankerman,'' and replace it with a new part 13, ``Tankermen and Persons in Charge of Transfer of Dangerous Liquid and Liquefied Gas.'' The Coast Guard is proposing to add chemical testing for dangerous drugs to the requirements for obtaining a tankerman endorsement on an MMD. Because the ``Tankerman'' rulemaking has not been finalized, the proposal to add drug testing requirements is set out as amendment to the existing requirements in 46 CFR subpart 12.20. The final rule will place the drug testing requirements in subpart 12.20 or a new 46 CFR part 13, as appropriate.

0,FT943-741 ,"FT943-741 _AN-EI1EIABHFT 940928   FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Skoda pins hope on new model      By VINCENT BOLAND      PRAGUE   Skoda Automobilova, the Czech car maker which is part of the Volkswagen group, is hopeful that the launch of its new Felicia model, due to roll off assembly lines in November, will help revive the company's flagging fortunes. Volkswagen, which is due to increase its stake from 31 per cent to 70 per cent next year, hopes so too. The company expects to produce 11,000 Felicias by the end of the year and new assembly lines are currently being installed at its main manufacturing plant at Mlada Boleslav, north of Prague. The company's production of the Favorit model, introduced in 1988, ended earlier this month. A management and labour dispute over Skoda's plans to lay off 800 workers could still threaten the timetable for the launch of the Felicia. The unions remain on strike alert while negotiations continue to try to resolve the issue. Skoda made a loss of Kc4.26bn (Dollars 152m) last year on revenues of Kc35bn, and further losses are expected this year as a result of the fall in production due to the change of model. After producing 220,000 cars last year production is expected to fall to 180,000 this year before rising next year to 1993 levels. The company is trying to reduce its dependency on the domestic market, where customers have increasingly preferred to purchase western car models in the last two years as incomes and spending power among Czechs has risen. Skoda is targeting new markets in Latin America and South-East Asia. Outside the Czech Republic, Skoda's main markets are Germany, Poland, Greece, the UK and Israel. The company has signed up new distributors in China, North Korea and the countries of the former Soviet Union in an effort to expand sales in those markets.   Companies:-  Skoda Automobilova.

According to German press reports, Mr Lopez had described Germans as either 'square-heads' or 'concrete-heads' to an audience of more than 1,000 bankers and business people in Madrid on Tuesday. After a day's investigation and much dictionary-thumbing, VW officials claimed to have divined that the Basque firebrand had referred in unscripted remarks to German Hartnackigkeit, which means obstinacy or, more charitably, persistence. In terms which reportedly 'amazed' his audience, he said Germans had a chance for future success only if they applied their methodical ways to developing more creativity. Spanish people brimmed with creative flair. What they lacked was the methodical German approach. Mr Lopez, who left General Motors abruptly in March followed by a clutch of his 'warrior' managers and legal actions alleging industrial espionage, also claimed that in the next century there would be only three big carmakers in Europe: one German, one Japanese and one Franco-Italian group. The German survivor, Volkswagen, might take over its indigenous rivals in the meantime. The latest upset follows a series of events that could put Mr Lopez at odds with his new employer. On Monday he contradicted clear statements from Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, on how the two men met. Mr Piech said in a Financial Times interview he had been approached by Mr Lopez shortly before Christmas. This was seen as an attempt to distance himself from the controversy surrounding his new employee. Mr Lopez said this week that they had been brought together by a components supplier. This version was later confirmed by the group's chief spokesman. Carmakers hit panic button, Page 21   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

Details of the financial transactions between BMW and Honda were revealed for the first time yesterday with the publication of the Japanese carmaker's first-quarter results. It was also disclosed that Honda paid BMW Pounds 74m to buy back the 20 per cent stake that Rover previously owned in Honda of the UK Manufacturing, the Japanese carmaker's UK assembly plant in Swindon. According to the Honda figures, the net cost to BMW of unravelling the cross-shareholdings between Rover and Honda totalled Pounds 126m. The one-off gains from the Rover transactions helped to more than double Honda pre-tax profits in the first quarter (April to June) of its 1994-95 financial year to Y32.2bn (Dollars 327m) from Y15.3bn a year earlier including a Y14.6bn gain from the Rover deal. Net profit almost quadrupled to Y23.1bn from Y6.1bn, including a Y12.8bn gain from the sale of the Rover hold-ing. Honda's operating profit for the quarter increased by 15.8 per cent to Y25.8bn from Y22.3bn a year earlier. Cost-cutting efforts saved Honda Y19.5bn, but the yen's strength against the dollar reduced operating income by Y26.5bn. Honda turnover for the three months to the end of June rose by 5.8 per cent to Y973.1bn from Y919.6bn in the corresponding period a year ago. The group's results were supported by a strong performance in the US, where its car sales volume (the Honda and Acura brands) has risen by 15.1 per cent in the first seven months this year.

The agreements were unveiled last night in Berlin following 3 1/2 years of discussions and several co-operation agreements. Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, said: 'This kind of co-operation between two huge industrial groups is still considered unique.' Mr Shinroku Morohashi, the chairman of Mitsubishi, said that despite the differences in management philosophy and corporate culture, relations between the two companies 'would deepen'. The projects are aimed at consolidating Daimler-Benz's strategy of gaining a foothold in Japan and south-east Asia. They are also designed to strengthen the competitiveness of Mitsubishi. Projects range from environmental and recycling licence agreements and joint ventures to distribution and marketing of Daimler-Benz products. They include: Metallurgical recycling process. A joint venture between Mercedes Benz and Austrian Industries will take responsibility for technology transfer and development, while Mitsubishi will market the process in Japan and throughout the Asian market. The process replaces the conventional method of shredding used cars. Car industry. A subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz will assemble, distribute and market the Mitsubishi L200 pick-up truck in South Africa. Electronics. Mitsubishi Electric will supply Temic Telefunken microelectronic, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, with technology required for the manufacture of semi-conductors for cars. Plastics. Both companies will conduct a one-year feasibility study on the recycling of waste plastics, with emphasis on cars, aircraft and electric appliances.

Dafting Information       The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. Thomas J. Felleisen, Project Manager, and Mr. Stephen H. Barber, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.         Background and Purpose         On November 12, 1975, the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (now the International Maritime Organization or IMO) adopted the ``Code for Construction and Equipment of Ships Carring Liquefied Gases in Bulk'' (Gas Carrier Code), Resolution, A.328 (IX) without amendments. Coast Guard regulations based on this code were put into effect May 3, 1979 (44 25986), Since 1975, the Gas Carrier Code has been amended four times: April 19, 1978 (see Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) XXXVIII/22), May 8, 1979 (see MSC XL/26), May 20, 1980 (see MSC/Cir. 284), and June 14, 1983 (see MSC/Cir. 356).     IMO's amendments to the Gas Carrier Code include corrections and clarifications, incorporation of standards for new or novel containment systems, improvement of the carriage requirements for several of the more hazardous cargoes, expansion of the list of chemicals to which the code applies, and revisions to align the Gas Carrier Code with the ``International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (IBC) and the ``International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefield Gases in Bulk'' (IGC).     These amendments were developed by the IMO Subcommittee on Bulk Chemicals, the body responsible for maintenance of the Code. The Coast Guard actively participated in the development of these changes to the Gas Carrier Code by submitting position papers when the amendments were proposed. This rulemaking would revise the Coast Guard regulations in 46 CFR part 154 to reflect these amendments.     One of the most notable revisions would be the inclusion of standards for internal insulation tanks in new 154.454 through 154.458, as well as in several existing sections. These standards would be included in order to bring the U.S. regulations for liquefied gas vessels in line with the Gas Carrier Code.     Part 154 would be revised to include carriage requirements for seven cargoes previously regulated only under 46 CFR part 153. The cargoes are diethly ether, a mixture of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide containing not more than 30% ethylene oxide, isoprene, isopropylamine, monoethyamine, propylene oxide, vinyl ethyl ether, and vinylidene chloride. These cargoes are being added in order to bring the U.S. regulations for liquefied gas vessels in line with the Gas Carrier Code.

The Necessity for Introducing Low-Pollution Vehicles and  the Reasons for Selecting the Vehicle Types Covered in the Study    In Japan the abatement of atmospheric pollution has been  advocated for quite some time, and to date, various types of  measures have been devised to counter the so-called fixed  sources like factories, e.g., emission concentration controls,  aggregate emission volume controls and restrictions on fuels  used by factories and the like.    As a result of the use of petroleum-fueled internal  combustion engines as the motors for automobiles, they too, like  the other fixed pollution-generating sources, have become the  source of a considerable portion of the total volume of urban  exhaust gases.    For this reason, and in light of what is known about the  behavior in the environment of various substances in exhaust  gases and their effects on the human body, a systematic, phased  response has been devised within the technical framework of the  petroleum-fueled internal combustion engine designed  to abate exhaust gas from automobiles, e.g., through the  establishment of long-term technology development goals by the  Central Environmental Pollution Countermeasures Council, etc. As  a result, current petroleum-fueled internal combustion  engines may be safely called combinatorial aggregates of  incremental improvement technology which responds to  widespread demands for environmental considerations in addition  to such primary requirements for automobile engines as fuel  consumption and horsepower, etc.    In addition, a great many businesses, beginning with the  road  transport carriers, and other parties associated with road  transport, the ones using automobiles, have been giving their  due cooperation as well in reducing environmental impact by  implementing rational operations along with timely and  appropriate introduction of vehicles which have been improved in  this manner.    Although regular progress is being demonstrated in this way  by the restrictions on individual substances in exhaust gases  from automobile units, the volume of automobile travel brought  about by growth in the national economy is increasing, and the  overall volume of exhaust gases continues to rise.    Where this trend is particularly evident is in the  environmental problems of the greater metropolitan areas like  Tokyo and Osaka. Specifically, there are many areas where the  environmental standard for nitrogen dioxide (NO[.sup]2[/])  has not been achieved and there is no trend of improvement in  evidence. In order to cope with this situation, the ``Special  Measures Law Concerning the Reduction of the Total Amount of  Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) Emitted by Automobiles in Designated  Areas'' was passed in June of this year, and the basic policy,  etc. for reducing the total volume of NOx is scheduled to be  clarified by autumn of this year. According to the Environment  Agency, once this law is put into effect, environmental quality  standards will be attained by the year 2000; however, the  popularization of substantial numbers of low-pollution  vehicles is being counted upon to achieve this goal.    Furthermore, social concern over current environmental  issues is in transition to a global environmental approach  on issues like global warming from carbon dioxide  (CO[.sup]2[/]), and acid rain which is attributed to sulfur  oxides (SOx) and NOx, etc. In addition, a more global sweep is  being evidenced, e.g., the UN Conference on the  Environment and Development was held in Rio de Janeiro in  June of this year, and a Climatic Changes Framework Agreement  (Treaty to Prevent Global Warming) obtained the signatures of  more than 150 countries.    The amount of CO[.sup]2[/] emissions per person in Japan  is among the lowest group among the developed nations, but the  amount of these very CO[.sup]2[/] emissions is equal to  approximately 5% (276 million tons) of the world total,  fourth  highest in the world. Japan has established an Action Plan  To Prevent Global Warming designed to promote systematic,  comprehensive measures to deal with global warming and says that  it will achieve per-capita CO[.sup]2[/] emission volumes  which are at the 1990 level in the year 2000. A considerable  amount of effort is going to be required to achieve this target.    That being the case, hereafter, in response to consciousness  of environmental issues in which the focus will likely be placed  on the global environment in this manner, the  question of whether or not some sort of specific results will be  achieved by petroleum-fueled internal-combustion engine  automobile technology while pursuing the conventional  policy of incremental technical improvements is  likely to become an issue.    Regarding this point, there are those who indicate concern  about trade-off issues between existing technologies already  developed in response to conventional technical requirements,  and there is concern that, increasingly, the technical options  are becoming far too narrow and the solutions more difficult.    Naturally, while we continue to feel that it is important to  keep up with technical challenges in this fashion, there are  limits to coping with present and future environmental issues,  and to overcoming and improving on them with this approach  alone. Especially now, when the trend of society as a whole is  to demand material contributions toward protecting the  environment from those connected with road traffic, e.g., a  great many businesses, beginning with all road transport  carriers, it is necessary to accelerate actions and measures  designed to protect the environment by everyone concerned in  order to take some sort of obvious steps.    In particular, the deterioration of the urban environment,  e.g., the failure to achieve NO[.sup]2[/] emission standards,  etc., is being pointed out, while on the other hand, at present,  when it is being recognized that prompt implementation of  comprehensive measures like the elimination of extreme  concentrations or the improvement of traffic flow by the  promotion of road maintenance and upgrades is, very regrettably,  difficult, the adoption of a comprehensive, tandem approach of  seeking and promoting possibilities for using  low-pollution vehicles (low-emission vehicles) or  vehicles with no exhaust gas (zero-emission vehicles)  is being recognized as necessary and significant.    It is recognized that some of the so-called  low-pollution vehicles have matured in terms of their  stage of technical development to the extent that it is possible  to evaluate them as subjects of study. This study committee  adopted such a viewpoint, and on the assumption that there are  vehicles which have possibilities for mitigating in all aspects  the environmental impact from automobile exhaust gas which would  be used by road transport carriers who now have great occasion  to use diesel vehicles, which have contradictory characteristics  concerning both CO[.sup]2[/] and NOx in particular, and also  that the degree of their technical maturity has reached a  prescribed level, the committee decided to subject four types of  vehicles to study, i.e., energy-regenerating-type hybrid  vehicles, methanol vehicles, compressed natural gas (CNG)  vehicles and electric vehicles.    In addition, the decision was made to give consideration to  comprehensive introductory support measures so that these  vehicles could be introduced in as smooth a replacement cycle  for conventional vehicles as possible. In line with this, we  studied whether or not it is possible to use each of these  vehicles as productive assets.    As one of the steps in the study, the committee decided to  gain an understanding of the operating structures of the road  transport carriers which would correspond to the actual  operation of the four types of low-pollution vehicles and then  to do a compilation of vehicle use realities in the road  transport industry, to include vehicle procurement methods.    The committee decided that if, after having illuminated the  realities of vehicle usage learned in this manner and having  confirmed that a market exists which could match the performance  of low-pollution vehicles, it should be determined that their  autonomous popularization could not be anticipated in terms of  the operating structure of the industry, they would take under  consideration policy support measures.    II. Operating Structure of Road Transport Carriers    1. Size of Freight Carrier Firms    We will gain an understanding of this from various types of  data concerning the present status of freight carriers. However,  since the currently available data predates the effective date  for the Second Law on Material Handling, the data still contains  distinctions such as route and area, etc. According to the  classification of a small or medium enterprise established by  the Minor Enterprises Act, as of the end of March 1991,  99% of  area carrier firms and 83% of route carrier firms fell  under  the small or medium enterprise classification. When divided into  route and area classifications, small firms accounted for a  great majority of area trucking firms in terms of  capitalization, number of employees and number of vehicles. On  the other hand, among route trucking firms, it appears that  those capitalized at 100 million or more accounted for  17%, while those with 301 or more employees accounted for  19%,  and that these large firms account for a considerable share of  transport.    Thus, there are a great many medium and small-sized firms  among the road transport carriers, and so in order to bring up  the diffusion rate of low-pollution vehicles, it is important  that we begin working on firms at this operating level and not  just the large firms.

Operating Conditions    In order to gain an understanding of the business and  operating realities of road transport carriers, we will analyze  various kinds of business indicators by size of the carrier  firms.    First of all, in looking at the settlement of accounts  status, in route trucking, 13 firms were operating at a loss in  contrast with 98 firms operating at a profit, while in area  trucking, there were 194 in the black and 28 in the red. No  particular difference in the ratio of firms operating in the red  was detected in correlation with route and area trucking.  However, when analyzed by size, in contrast to the absence of  any correlation to size for firms operating at a loss among the  area trucking group, none of the firms operating at a loss among  the route trucking group were found among firms with 101  vehicles or more, and one could say there is a clear difference  correlating to size among the route trucking firms for the ratio  of firms operating at a loss.

Route trucking has risen to the  4-5% level and area trucking has leveled off at the  5% level.  On the other hand, this figure is at the fairly high level of  7-8% for manufacturing and 7% for the retail  industry.  Nevertheless, in the wholesale industry this level is low at  5%.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 2-4.

The average rate of recurring profit on total capital  for route trucking is 5.4% and falls below that for firms  other  than those with 1-20 vehicles or with 301 and above. In  addition, there appears to be a difference in the ratio of  recurring profits to operating revenue which correlates to the  size of the firm. In the case of area trucking, the correlation  between this difference and size is all the more apparent. In  particular, the average for firms with 1-20 vehicles is  -1.6%  and a great many of these firms are operating in the red.       Chart 2-5.

This  represents the ratio of liquid assets to current liabilities,  and normally, when this ratio exceeds 100%, one can  conclude  there is no need to worry about short-term solvency. In  connection with route trucking, other than firms with 1-20 or  with 301 or more vehicles, this ratio falls below 100% and  there is lingering concern about short-term solvency. On the  other hand, in the case of area trucking, excluding firms with  20 or less vehicles, this ratio exceeds 100% and from the  standpoint of liquidity, one can say that area trucking firms  are in better shape. Also, when the ratio of long-term  capitalization to fixed assets (where one evaluates the  operating status of long-term capitalization) exceeds  100%, it  indicates that there are current liabilities requiring  short-term repayment in connection with the portion which is in  excess and that it is being covered by fixed assets capital. In  route trucking, firms other than those with 1-20 or 301 or more  vehicles, and in area trucking, firms with 20 or less vehicles  exceed 100%. Also, among these firms, the individual net  worth  ratio is declining as well.       Chart 2-6.

Note: In the majority  of firms among small and medium-sized enterprises, profitability  is low, and their operating efficiency and financial structure  too are not altogether good. In particular, the liquidity ratio  is quite a bit below 100%, and one could say that there is  lingering concern about their short-term solvency.    3. Total Expenditure and Composition for Freight Carrier  Firms    In order to analyze the operating realities of the firms, we  study the composition of the various expenses incurred in the  course of their business activity. According to small and medium  cost indicators compiled by the Small and Medium Enterprise  Agency, the average sales volume of a sound enterprise is  309 million, and 96.1% of that goes to cover total  costs  with fixed costs accounting for 37.5% and variable costs  for  58.6%. Also, the personnel cost ratio, including welfare  costs,  employee training and the like, is 38.8%. Fuel costs,  repair  costs, and depreciation costs are cited as expense items  relating to vehicles during the course of business. Depreciation  costs average 13 million and as a ratio of operating costs  have grown to 13.6%, a sales volume ratio of 4.4%,  second only  to executive salaries and allowances. As for other industries,  e.g., manufacturing, the figure is 39 million, 3.2%  of the  total cost structure; for the wholesale industry it is 9  million, 0.4% and for retail, it is 2.5 million,  1.1%.  Vehicle fuel and repair costs average 8 million,  2.5% of  the total cost structure.       Chart 2-7.

Among area trucking firms, vehicles account for 5.0% of  the  fixed asset depreciation costs. Also, in totaling up fuel costs,  maintenance costs and depreciation costs, they account for  7.6%  of operating costs among route trucking firms and 14.1%  among  area trucking firms, and the cost burden relating to vehicles is  growing for area trucking firms.    Further, if you examine these costs by the numbers of  vehicles, the weight of vehicle depreciation costs  for route trucking firms with 50 or less vehicles, it exceeds  the average for route trucking firms. Among area trucking firms,  the ratio of vehicle-related expenditures is higher overall when  compared with that for route trucking firms, and here again, the  depreciation cost component ratio is higher among smaller firms  with 50 vehicles or less.    The introduction of low-pollution vehicles is a very  important business issue for road transport carriers. As  evidenced in the indicators of the Small and Medium Enterprise  Agency, compared with other industries, their depreciation cost  burden is higher, and according to MOT indicators, it is obvious  that the smaller the enterprise, the larger the burden for fuel  costs, maintenance costs and vehicle depreciation costs  accounted for in operating costs. In the future, when weighing  measures to popularize and promote low-pollution vehicles, it  will be necessary to consider handling measures with business  realities such as these fully in mind.

Bus Company Business Realities    In examining bus company business realities, both private  and  public, it is obvious that they have become deficit-prone  business operations. According to the motor transport business  indicators of the Road Transport Bureau of the MOT, as far as  can be determined by the indicators when averaged, bus service  operators, both private and public, are operating at a deficit,  and even charter bus firms have a very low earnings structure.  In particular, public bus service companies are running  substantial operating deficits. Of the general bus service  companies which qualify to receive MOT regional bus subsidies  (333 firms), no more than 55, 16.5%, are operating in the  black, and the overwhelming majority have lapsed into deficit  operations.    In addition, bus companies have high capital investment in  vehicles and buildings and the like, and a high fixed assets  ratio (fixed assets/net worth), even in comparison to trucking  firms. That is also manifested in a low rate of turnover of  total capital (operating revenue/total capital), and the fact  that revenue is extremely low compared to the scale of  investment and that investment efficiency has deteriorated is  obvious. Because this operating structure has become intrinsic,  with the exception of public companies, the liquidity ratio  (liquid assets/current liabilities... indicates the ability to  make external payments) of bus companies has dropped below  100%, and they are confronting credit-related problems.    When we look at costs per operating kilometer, income per  kilometer of actual travel is 451, while costs are  490. According to the component itemization of these costs,  the component ratio of personnel costs is very high, vehicle  maintenance costs account for 2.91%, and vehicle  depreciation  costs for 4.43%. The ratio of vehicle depreciation costs  is  equivalent to that for the costs of fuel, oil and lubricants,  and in terms of the overhead burden has become an important  factor.    Thus, bus operations are working under extremely stringent  conditions, and in a great many cases bus service operators are  pursuing other lines of business as well. Generally, bus service  companies are assessed as enterprises having a highly public  nature, and their credit rating as enterprises ends up being  boosted. Accordingly, when you examine the ratio of operating  profit to net sales by size of operation for bus service only,  among the bus services in question the operating costs exceed  operating revenue in all cases, regardless of size, but when  evaluated on an overall enterprise basis, including the other  lines of business, those bus companies with 1-30 and 301 or more  vehicles are generating operating profits, and even in terms of  recurring profit are showing up in the black.    Thus, for bus companies which are operating in a business  environment more severe than that for trucking firms when judged  as a separate and independent business, the introduction of  low-pollution vehicles will be a greater burden. However, the  public bus companies have opportunities to bring in funding from  general revenue sources, and the pilot introduction of  low-pollution vehicles in terms of the aspect of environmental  management is to be anticipated. Also, among the private firms,  even in those where the bus service operation is running at a  deficit, when one makes allowance for subsidies from within the  company, it is perhaps possible that the burden of introducing  low-pollution vehicles can be covered to a certain extent.  However, even in that case, reduction of the costs to introduce  these vehicles will determine the numbers introduced just as it  will for the trucking firms, and so various types of support  measures will be needed to facilitate their popularization.

Current Vehicle Usage of Road Transport Carriers    1. Vehicle Procurement Methods    Later on we will present these in detail, but as a measure  for popularizing low-pollution vehicles which are relatively  high-priced in comparison to existing diesel vehicles,  especially among small-scale firms with low liquidity ratios,  the mitigation of the initial capital burden will be highly  significant, and it is conceivable that a great many cases will  require support measures in combination with a lease system  designed for this purpose. Nevertheless, it appears that at  present, there are few cases in which these businesses use  leases to procure vehicles. Accordingly, along with clarifying  current forms of procurement and the reasons for not using  leases, etc., by implementing a questionnaire survey of these  businesses, we gained insight from existing data into the  circumstances for and problems with using leases when procuring  vehicles.    First of all, let's look at the types and methods of vehicle  procurement by businesses. According to a questionnaire survey  sent out to the various branches of the Tokyo Metropolitan  Trucking Association in which a majority of the members are  small and medium firms, almost all (23 out of 25) responded that  ``when required, trucks are purchased in small lots,'' and cases  of combined, large-lot purchases are limited. Also, it is  obvious that when purchasing vehicles, approximately 60%  of the  firms are cognizant that ``it is important because of the need  for a fixed amount of depreciation costs every year'' from an  accounting standpoint.    Furthermore, as reasons for the poor utilization of leases  for vehicle purchases, ``because even when money is borrowed,  funding can be procured at low-interest,'' and ``because of the  structuring to produce profits for the actual years of a  vehicle's serviceable life after it is fully depreciated'' were  cited most often. Also, more than one third of the respondents  indicated that it is ``because they do not fully understand the  merits of leasing.''       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 3-1.

As of  1990, the number of lease-held passenger cars was 420,000,  buses, 10,000, and trucks, 680,000, and in terms of component  ratio, trucks and passenger cars were the more prevalent. Also,  in terms of the ratio of lease-held vehicles accounted for in  the numbers of vehicles in use, leases accounted for 7.2%  of  buses, for 7.1% of trucks, for 1.3% of passenger  cars, and for  an overall average of 2.7%. Whatever class of vehicle one  considers, lease utilization is rising steadily, and it appears  this trend is going to continue in the future as well.     Incidentally, according to a FY1990 lease demand trends  survey on leasing overall conducted by the Japan Leasing  Association, corporations then utilizing leases accounted for  86.9% of the total, a 2.3% rise in comparison with  a survey  conducted in 1986. As for the items being leased, communications  equipment and exchanges were the leading category, and for  vehicles, leases were used by 31.5% of enterprises,  demonstrating a rise of more than 10% in comparison with  the  20.2% recorded for 1987.    All of which is to say that for low-pollution vehicles, the  speed of future technical innovation will be greater in  comparison with existing vehicles, or in other words, as a  result, the risk of their becoming superannuated is expected to  be high, and so too there will be a greater need to avoid the  risk of superannuation associated with the speedy introduction  of low-pollution vehicles with higher performance, and in this  aspect, the merit of leasing seems to be growing.    As far as we can judge from the data and the survey findings  mentioned above, for medium and small enterprises vehicle  procurement is an important business issue and independent  procurement is the norm. Also, as far as dissatisfaction with  the lease system is concerned, there are problems relating to  ``the impression that it is relatively expensive,'' and ``the  terms establishing the residual value, or the period of the  lease.'' Consequently, in the event assistance policies which  employ leasing are devised, a system which is responsive and  easy for businesses to use, and the employment of low-interest  funding such as fiscal investments and loans designed to negate  ``the impression that leases are relatively expensive'' will  likely be indispensable. And, it will probably be necessary to  give consideration to the methods of establishing residual value  and lease periods as well.              Graph 3-2. Lease Ratio Changes      In any event, if a lease system is incorporated as part of  the assistance policies, concrete, readily understandable public  relations (PR) aimed at these businesses is going be a major  prerequisite.    2. Business Operations and the Realities of Vehicle Usage    We sorted out the realities of how trucks and buses are  being  used on a daily basis in various businesses primarily on the  basis of the results of a questionnaire in cooperation with the  Tokyo Metropolitan Trucking Association supplemented with  existing data and investigative hearings. Below, we have  compiled the actual conditions and special features concerning  the forms of truck and bus usage judged in terms of, (1) size of  enterprise, (2) transport destination, and (3) items conveyed.    (1) Forms of Usage in Terms of the Size of the Enterprise    In the case of the major transport carriers, for usage  within  an urban area (travel distances of 50-80 km), 2-ton vehicles are  the primary choice. However, 4-ton vehicles are used for hauling  to industry. For suburban, large-volume hauling (travel  distances of 100-140 km), 5-ton vehicles or larger are used. For  long-distance hauling (travel distances of 500-600 km), 10-ton  vehicles or larger are used, and transport is conducted at night.    In the case of medium-sized transport carriers, 2-ton  vehicles are used primarily for short-haul (travel distances of  30-50 km), and medium-to-long haul transport (travel distances  of 300-1000 km) is handled with 4-ton and 10-ton vehicles.    City-route buses travel around 110 km per day. They always  perform nearly the same travel pattern (frequent stops, and an  average vehicle speed of around 11 km/hr.). Also, the per-trip  travel distance of sight-seeing buses is around 200 km, and the  travel patterns of buses employed for specific services such as  shuttle service within airports, etc. are fixed within a  specific area.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 3-3.

Transport to distribution centers is  handled with 2-ton and 4-ton vehicles for 40-120 km trips, and  10-ton vehicles are used for trips exceeding 200 km. Trips are  made primarily in the early morning and daytime.    For deliveries to wholesale and retail stores, trips are  made  primarily during the day within the cities, and the travel  distance is 50-150 km. For deliveries to wholesale stores 2-ton  and 4-ton vehicles are used, and for deliveries to retail stores  2-ton vehicles are used.    In addition, for deliveries to construction sites, a variety  of vehicles, from 2-ton to 10-ton, are used and the travel  distances and operating features are diverse as well.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 3-4.

For transport of construction materials, a  variety of 2-ton, 4-ton and 10-ton trucks are used, and the  operating features are diverse as well. For the transport of  finished goods, food, daily necessities, books and printed  material, and liquors, mainly 2-ton and 4-ton vehicles are used.  Travel distance of around 100 km, primarily daytime trips within  the cities, and numerous delivery items is characteristic.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 3-5.

Among 4-ton vehicles, there is a  tendency to emphasize upgrade capability.    For long-distance transport, because there is a lot of cargo  to deliver and comfortable accommodations are sought due to long  driving time, etc., primarily 10-ton vehicles are used. Also,  since refueling in the course of a run is not desirable,  vehicles with good fuel consumption are sought.    In the case of route buses, stops are highly frequent, and  there are a great many acceleration and deceleration cycles.  Features such as road performance and ease of handling are  sought.    In the case of long-distance buses running between cities,  long-distance, overnight, high-speed operation is called for,  and safety, accommodation and cruising range, etc. are the  features sought.    3. Current Status of Urban Traffic    The present status of truck and bus usage by various  enterprises is as described above, but here we will address the  realities of truck usage and possession overall.    The number of trucks owned nationwide as of the end of March  1991, was 8.83 million, and of that, the number of trucks for  businesses numbered 900,000. In terms of the composition of the  types of cargo vehicles on a registered vehicle basis, compact  trucks accounted for just under 70% nationwide in  contrast with  full-sized trucks which, conversely, accounted for approximately  70% of business vehicles. In the case of compact trucks,  a high  percentage were gasoline vehicles. We will examine in detail the  full-sized truck class in which diesel vehicles accounted for  the majority. In the makeup of business vehicle types,  full-sized trucks in the 9-ton-and-over-to-under-11-ton class  were the most prevalent, accounting for 18.8%, followed by  trucks in the 3-4-ton class at 15.2% and the 2-3-ton  class at  15%. However, when full-sized and compact trucks are  lumped  together according to carrying capacity, the 2-3-ton carrying  capacity class vehicles were most prevalent at 19.8%. When  classified by operating area, the 2-3-ton class vehicles were  the overwhelming leaders in the Tokyo metropolitan area (Tokyo,  Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba) at 32.5%, and no more than  6.2%  nationwide, while trucks under 2 tons accounted for 10.5%  in  the Tokyo metropolitan area and about the same nationwide. In  the Kinki area (Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo) as well, the ratio of  2-3-ton class vehicles was higher in comparison with the  nationwide ratio. In the Nakagyo area (Aichi, Mie), unlike these  other two areas, the 3-4-ton class vehicles were the more  prevalent, and the component ratio for 9-11-ton class trucks was  high as well.

The average transport distance for  regular-sized business trucks is 83.2 km, and for compacts it is  35.3 km. Also, we consider these in terms of average transport  distance and number of tons transported per actual working  vehicle day.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 3-7.

It appears from  these figures that in practical terms, refueling is done once a  day, and so the cruising ranges which these travel distances  will demand of the low-pollution vehicles to be introduced will  be considered. For the number of transport tons, the number of  tons transported per working transport trip, rather than the  number of tons per day, will be considered for the performance  required. According to these figures the per-trip tonnage is 5.3  tons for full-sized vehicles and 0.8 tons for compacts. However,  large-sized trucks are included among the full-sized class, and  we need to take into consideration the fact that this inflates  the figures.    Note: Since these figures include times when the vehicles  are  running with no cargo, they represent the distances traveled,  rather than the average transport kilometer for business  vehicles cited above.

Kilometers traveled per working vehicle day = kilometers traveled/total vehicle  working days. 2. Number of tons transported per working vehicle day = number of tons  transported/number of working vehicle days. 3. Number of transport trips per working  vehicle day = total number of transport trips/number of working vehicle days. 4.  Kilometers traveled per working transport trip = kilometers traveled/total number of  transport trips. 5. Number of tons transported per working transport trip = number of  tons transported/total number of transport trips.      Next, we will sort out in simple terms the travel conditions  within cities. First of all, in terms of trucks in general, the  travel modes comprise a combination of 4 elements: idling,  acceleration, constant speed and deceleration. The 10-15-mode  travel used in calculating such things as automobile exhaust gas  regulations are representative. And, in diesel vehicle  regulations, 6-mode-travel is applied to heavy vehicles. In  FY1994, this will be changed to 13-mode to correspond with the  10-15 mode. Currently, the average 10-15-mode-travel vehicle  speed is 22.7 km/h.     According to this, in terms of average vehicle speeds,  although the data is from 1985, the average for Tokyo's 23 wards  was 14.9 km/h, roughly less than half the national average of  36.9 km/h. This average has declined in other metropolitan areas  as well, it was 19.5 km/h in the Osaka-Nagoya area, a reduction  in average speed of just under 13% for Osaka and of just  under  24% for Nagoya when compared with 1980 data. According to  this  data, it appears that the average vehicle speed is falling and  that the frequency of idling is rising as shown in these graphs  based on the results of study by the MOT's Traffic Safety and  Nuisance Research Institute.              Graph 3-9. Current Travel Modes (10-15 Mode, 11 Mode)               Graph 3-10. Average Traveling Speeds on Public Roads (Peak Hours)                Graph 3-11. Average Vehicle Speed and Idling Cycles per km      Also, since the frequency of idling cycles is high for buses  because of idling at bus stops and while passengers get on and  off, in addition to traffic signals and traffic backups, their  average vehicle speed is low. According to the constant speeds  established in the urban bus operating schedules for FY1989, the  average bus speed in the Tokyo metropolitan area was 11.4 km/h,  and 12.8 km/h in the Osaka-Nagoya metropolitan area, even lower  than the average vehicle speeds cited above. And, according to  data on actual Tokyo route buses (Shibuya-Shinbashi, 17 January  1992), the lowest average speed in one day was 9.15 km/h over 10  vehicle hours, approximately less than half compared to that for  the early morning.    In addition, backup time at the major intersections within  Tokyo reached 2,150 hours in 1990. On a per-day basis this was  equivalent to approximately 6 hours. Thus, for urban travel,  travel patterns with high idling frequency and low average  vehicle speed are on the rise.              Graph 3-12. Changes in Backup Time of Major Intersections in Tokyo     IV. Features and Possible Uses of Vehicle Types Covered by  Study    In this chapter we will sort out the features and specific  systems as well as possible uses, etc. for (1) hybrid vehicles;  (2) electric vehicles; (3) methanol vehicles and CNG vehicles  respectively.    1. Hybrid Vehicles    A brief synopsis of the concepts, special features and  specific systems relating to hybrid vehicles is offered as  follows:    1) Concepts     Hybrid vehicles have internal combustion engines and  non-internal combustion engines for motors, and depending on the  travel conditions, etc., have the ability to combine the motive  power of its non-internal combustion engine with the internal  combustion engine output, or to make exclusive use of the motive  power of its non-internal combustion engine.    2) Features    We would sort out the principal features of hybrid vehicles  as follows:    (1) Their intent is to allow the merits and demerits of  internal combustion engines and non-internal combustion engines  to compliment one another, and to resolve problems such as fuel  consumption, exhaust gas properties, cruising range, and the  like.    (2) They offer a great deal of flexibility in terms of the  internal combustion engine for which it is possible to consider  a wide range of engines such as methanol and natural gas engines  and not just gasoline and diesel engines, and afford a variety  of combinations to meet performance requirements.    Furthermore, based on the latest technical advances, hybrids  have been proposed which, instead of being limited to simple  combination methods, focus on ways to harness energy  regeneration and on energy conservation measures and the like.    3) Specific Examples    Various types of systems have been proposed for hybrid  vehicles, some examples of the leading specific systems are as  follows:    (1) Excitation-type Regeneration Systems     a. Developed with the aim of lowering pollution, conserving  energy and reducing the volume CO[.sup]2[/] exhaust.    b. Regenerates braking energy and the like and stores it in  batteries. An electric motor is activated with this  battery-stored energy and the output of the internal combustion  engine is supplemented by it for starting, acceleration and  upgrades. By reducing the load on the internal combustion engine  with this stored energy, lower pollution, energy conservation  and the like are to be achieved.    c. Capable of sustaining output equivalent to that of  current  diesel engines. Reduction of fuel consumption as well through  the regeneration of energy is conceivable.              Graph 4-1. Diesel-Electric Hybrid Vehicle     d. Among the excitation-type regeneration systems, a working  bus with the HIMR (Hybrid Inverter-Controlled Motor and Retarder  System) method diesel-electric hybrid system has been perfected,  and has been put into partial use.              Graph 4-2. Diesel-Accumulator-type Hybrid Vehicle      (2) Accumulator-type Hybrid System    a. Developed with the aim of lowering pollution, conserving  energy and reducing the volume of CO[.sup]2[/] exhaust.    b. Braking energy is regenerated and stored with hydraulic  pressure. A hydraulic pump is activated with this stored  hydraulic pressure for starting, acceleration and upgrades and  by reducing the load on the internal combustion engine with this  hydraulic stored energy, lower pollution, energy conservation  and the like are to be achieved.    c. Capable of sustaining output equivalent to that of  current  diesel engines. Reduction of fuel consumption as well through  the regeneration of energy is conceivable.    d. Operational tests with test vehicles are being conducted.     (3) Engine-Generator-type Hybrid Systems    a. Technology developed with the aim of improving the  cruising range of electric vehicles.    b. Operates an internal combustion engine at a high  efficiency rating point to run the vehicle and power an electric  motor to produce electric power. Stores the surplus energy  generated by the internal combustion engine in batteries.    c. Output performance is equivalent to that of an electric  vehicle so that the vehicle can be powered by the electric motor  alone.    d. Concept stage (theoretical studies), or basic research  stage.    (4) Engine-Electric Motor-Combination-type Hybrid System    a. Improved energy conservation the main development  objective.    b. System which operates on either the internal combustion  engine or the electric motor. A variety of methods have been  proposed over quite some time, but one of the latest systems,  the VW-Audi System (operates on an electric motor as the primary  engine for travel within the city and on an internal combustion  engine as the primary engine for travel outside the city, and  when the electric power output runs down, it uses the internal  combustion engine as an auxiliary engine) has been proposed for  passenger cars.    c. Improvement is needed on power output problems to where  the system is equivalent with gasoline engine systems, as well  as on the cruising range.    d. VW-Audi is perfecting the system on the passenger car  level. It is in the theoretical study stage in Japan.              Graph 4-3. VW Hybrid System     4) Possible Uses    Considering things like the technical features of hybrid  vehicles like those described above, they are judged to be  particularly suitable for large-city traveling. As pointed out  earlier, travel within cities demonstrates a pattern of  repeating starts and stops, and hybrid vehicles devised to  regenerate braking energy can be described as systems with high  introduction value.    Also, the introduction of hybrid vehicles requires no  provision of special infrastructure, and so one can claim there  are few physical impediments to their introduction. Furthermore,  test operations are proceeding smoothly, and technical  reliability is growing.    2. Electric Vehicles    We will sort out the concept and features of electric  vehicles as automobiles, and the issues, etc. presently being  confronted as follows:    1) Concept     Electric vehicles use electric power as their energy source  and operate with electric motors. Charging batteries are used  primarily as the energy supply source.              Graph 4-4. Vehicle Component Diagrams      2) Features    Given that it eliminates entirely exhaust gases with SOx and  NOx while operating, and that, in terms of the electricity  generating source, the volume of CO[.sup]2[/] gas emitted is  small compared to that of gasoline vehicles, the electric  vehicle is the ultimate expression of a low-pollution vehicle.  Also, it has the added advantage of producing very little noise.    3) Problems    At present, 1,000 vehicles or more, mainly compacts and  light  vehicles, are being used on the road in Japan, but the short  per-charge cruising range (approximately 100-150 km at a  constant speed of 40 km/h, around 50 km within the city), and  the short life span of the batteries have been pointed out as  problems in terms of their use. Also, continuing new development  is needed on systems overall for electric vehicles because the  current price levels are very high, from 2 to 10 times that of  existing vehicles, and that wide variation is also a major issue  in terms of popularizing their introduction.    Furthermore, acceleration is poor, and the driveability in  cities, where responsive driving is called for, leaves something  to be desired. And for vehicle design as well, current designs  are premised on lead storage batteries, and design constraints  in terms of weight and space are imposed. It appears that in the  future factors like the aging of the truck operator population  and the employment of some women will be inevitable, and if  attempts are made to offset this with chassis design strategies  as part of the measures to secure a labor force, these storage  batteries might become limiting factors.    In order to solve these problems, development of smaller,  more powerful storage batteries (high-energy-density batteries)  is needed, and a great deal of hope is placed on results from  development work on storage batteries as mobile, high-output  sources of electricity being promoted by the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI). In this connection,  research and development (RD) on a new type of compact,  high-performance battery, including a fast-charge system, began  in April of 1992, and along with it research studies are to be  initiated on the provision of social systems and infrastructure  which will support the mass popularization of electric vehicles.  It is also anticipated that in the future, with mass production,  there will be substantial declines in the price levels of  electric vehicles.     4) Possible Uses    At the current stage of development, in terms of road  performance, etc., it would be difficult for electric vehicles  to compete with existing diesel vehicles, especially in carrying  capacity in the 2-ton class or above. However, once the essence  of electric vehicles is understood, one can assume that because  they produce no exhaust gas and very little noise, they will be  used actively in specific fields. And, with future advances in  storage battery technology, gradually, their fields of use are  likely to broaden.    3. Methanol Vehicles    We will sort out the concepts and features of methanol  vehicles as automobiles, and the specific issues they are  confronting at present as follows:              Graph 4-5. Areas of Responsibility of Related Industries in Electric Vehicles and Gasoline Vehicles     1) Concepts     With methanol vehicles there are two types of concepts, the  auto type and the diesel type. The auto type is a vehicle  mounted with a methanol engine which is a slightly modified  gasoline engine, and the diesel type is a vehicle equipped with  a spark ignition device or glow plug ignition device based on a  diesel engine.              Graph 4-6. Auto-Type Methanol Engine                Graph 4-7. Diesel-Type Methanol Vehicle      2) Features    With the auto-type methanol vehicle it is possible to  achieve  exhaust gas levels which are equivalent to those of gasoline  engines for CO, HC and NOx because of the use of a ternary  catalyst. And, with the diesel-type methanol vehicle, NOx  exhaust content is lower than that of diesel engines and black  smoke is not exhausted.    3) Problems    With equivalent capacity fuel tanks the cruising range per  fillup is short, half that of gasoline and diesel vehicles, and  so it is limited to short-range service like pickup and delivery  within cities.    Also, their use for long-distance transport would require  the  installation of a fuel supply network. While long-distance runs  would be possible by increasing the carrying capacity of the  fuel tanks, it would have to be at the cost of lowering the  effective carrying capacity of the vehicle.    In addition, there are technical problems like the corrosion  resistance of the fuel supply system materials, and with the  auto-type, improving the low temperature starting and high  temperature restarting performance and reducing the levels of  unburned methanol and aldehyde in the exhaust gas, etc.    4) Possible Uses    Methanol vehicles have already been under test operation for  an extensive period of time and a broad field of use is assumed.  However, as cited above, the cruising range per refuel is short  and the installation of new fuel supply facilities will be  required, so for the time being their use will be focused on  travel within cities. In the future, as fuel-supply networks are  established, it is assumed they will be used in long distance  travel modes as well.    4. CNG Vehicles    We will sort out the concepts and features of CNG vehicles,  and the issues and specific systems, etc. as follows:    1) Concepts    Natural gas vehicles (NGV) are vehicles fueled with natural  gas, and NGV presently operating are classified according to the  form of the natural gas in the fuel tanks: as compressed natural  gas (CNG) vehicles or as liquefied natural gas (LNG) vehicles.    The total number of NGV presently operating in the world is  estimated to be from 750,000 to 1 million (according to a  ``Clean Fuels Report'' article of April 1990), and most of these  are CNG vehicles. LNG vehicles on the other hand, have yet to be  generally popularized due to difficulties with the fuel supply  and storage aspects, and so, other than some in the U.S., only a  very few are in use.    There are also adsorbed natural gas (ANG) vehicles which  store natural gas at low pressure (1/5 - 1/3 of the pressure of  CNG vehicles) using an adsorbing material, but at present, these  are in the research stage on natural gas adsorbing materials and  have not been put into practical application.    2) Features    We will sort out the main features or advantages of CNG as  follows:    (1) Natural gas fuel has been established as an energy  substitute for petroleum, reserves equivalent to those of  petroleum have been confirmed, and it is endowed with superior  supply stability since the producing nations are not  disproportionately located in the Middle East.    (2) It has a low CO[.sup]2[/] generation rate per calorie  unit (70% that of petroleum).    (3) Because impurities are removed when it is liquefied, the  purity of the methane is high and it has great potential for  lowering pollution.    (4) The following can be pointed to for its features as an  automotive fuel:    a. It has a high octane value of around 130 and superior  knocking resistance, enabling a high-compression-ratio engine as  a result.    b. Lean-burn stability parameters are broader, resulting in  improved fuel consumption (energy conserving).    c. By burning in a mixture with light oil, it is possible to  use natural gas as a fuel in diesel engines without modifying  them by adding plugs. Technical development is underway on the  assumption that this will result in lower exhaust of black smoke  and NOx, and this will have the effect of improving the vehicle  usage process.    d. Because it is a gas fuel, it has good starting properties  in cold climates.    e. Since fuel supply will use gas pipelines, vehicle  transport with tank trucks and the like are not necessary.    f. Since impurities are not found in the fuel, it will be  possible to extend engine life and to reduce maintenance and  administrative costs.    (5) When converting vehicles into NGVs, one needs only to  modify a gasoline or diesel vehicle's fuel supply system, spark  or ignition system (only for CNG diesel type vehicles) and, as  needed, the compression ratio. Vehicle performance already has  been demonstrated in the case of gasoline-type vehicles. Also,  with mass production, it is possible that the costs can be kept  at a level that is equivalent to that of conventional vehicles.    3) Problems    The principal CNG problems are as follows:    (1) The areas in Japan which are supplied with natural gas  by  pipeline are limited to the major metropolitan areas and the  domestic natural gas production areas of Shinkata, Akita and  Chiba, and at present, this network cannot be quickly expanded  nationwide.    (2) On-board space must be secured and vehicle weight  increased in order to accommodate a fuel storage cylinder.    (3) The per-refuel cruising range is short, around one  fourth  that of gasoline and diesel vehicles equipped with identical  capacity fuel tanks, so they are limited to short-range service  such as pickup and delivery duty within cities.    4) Specific Examples    A variety of system types have been proposed for CNG  vehicles, and these are roughly classified as light and heavy  vehicle types, and generally categorized according to engine  system and form of fuel usage.    Categories of CNG    Light Vehicles: Bifuel, gasoline and CNG, systems (fuel  switching), and CNG-exclusive systems.    Heavy Vehicles: Bifuel, gasoline and CNG, systems;  dual-fuel,  diesel fuel and CNG, systems (mixed burn); and CNG-exclusive  systems.    They also can be classified in terms of two combustion  methods, the lean-fuel-air-combustion (lean burn) method and the  theoretical-air-fuel-ratio-combustion (stoichiometric) method.    (1) Gasoline/CNG Bifuel Vehicle    The gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle is one that is capable of  interchangeably using the two fuels, gasoline and CNG. A  majority of the NGVs presently operating in the world are  gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicles which are gasoline vehicles that  have been modified by adding CNG fuel systems. Conversion kits  for these modifications can be procured cheaply overseas. The  reason for the spread of this method appears to be due to the  lower convenience of vehicles fueled with CNG alone, as a result  of the restricted cruising range (travel distance per tank of  fuel) and fuel supply facilities.    In gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicles, the CNG is stored in a fuel  cylinder under 150-200 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] of pressure and after  it travels through a fuel pipe and it is reduced to  near-atmospheric pressure in a pressure regulator  (pressure-reducing valve) located in the engine compartment, it  is fed to the engine through a gas/air mixer. As for the engine  combustion method, in nearly all cases in Japan it is the same  as that for gasoline engines, the theoretical air-fuel ratio  combustion method, in which the air-fuel ratio (_l_) is  operated  at close to 1.0, is employed, and in order to purify the exhaust  gas, a ternary catalytic device is added.              Graph 4-8. Schematic of Foreign Gasoline/CNG Bifuel Vehicle      (2) Diesel Fuel/CNG Dual-Fuel Vehicle    Natural gas has a low octane rating in comparison to light  oil and it is hard for auto-ignition to occur, and so it is  difficult to use in this manner in compression-ignition type  diesel engines. Therefore, if one is going to combust natural  gas in a diesel engine, an ignition source is needed.  Accordingly, one gets the natural gas to combust by modifying  the fuel and intake systems and using light oil as the ignition  source. This is referred to as the diesel fuel/CNG dual-fuel  system. The diesel engine is operated with a high compression  ratio, and so it is possible to make more efficient use of  natural gas with it than with a gasoline engine. However,  because the kits to convert diesel vehicles into diesel fuel/CNG  dual-fuel vehicles have not come into wide use at present, the  price is high, and the installation is more complicated than in  the case of a conversion to a gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle.  Nonetheless, since the use of this type of vehicle is  conceivable as a measure to improve the use of diesel vehicles,  there are hopes for technology development.    (3) CNG-Only Vehicles    Gasoline/CNG bifuel vehicle and diesel fuel/CNG dual-fuel  vehicle engines use a number of different fuels, and so while  they are optimized to make the best use of the combustion  features of natural gas, they cannot help but do an inadequate  job. CNG-only vehicles are mounted with engines designed for CNG  in order to make the best use of the combustion characteristics  of natural gas. For cases in which the vehicle is being  converted from a gasoline vehicle, a  theoretical-air-fuel-ratio-combustion method engine is used. For  conversions from diesel vehicles, a lean-fuel-air-mixture method  is under development.    CNG-only vehicles, including those converted from diesel  vehicles, are mounted with diesel-type, premixed,  single-chamber-ignition system engines; diesel-type, premixed,  precombustion-chamber-spark-ignition system engines; a  mechanical-carburetor-control system engine developed by Gasunie  NV (The Netherlands); and an engine in which the fuel-air-ratio  is electronically controlled developed by TNO (The Netherlands).    5) Possible Uses    Numerous CNG vehicles already are in actual use in various  foreign countries, and from a technology development standpoint  there are few problems. However, CNG-only vehicles have a short  per-refuel cruising range, and so their use will be focused in  cities. As stated earlier, the CNG supply system is limited to  areas which are focused on large cities, and these CNG-only  vehicles can be described as suitable for use in large cities  where the environmental problems are severe.    Since CNG dual-fuel vehicles can use diesel fuel as well, it  will be possible to use them for long-distance trips as well. If  they are used as transit vehicles and the like for major cities,  the claim could be made that their use would be highly valuable  from an urban environmental standpoint.    V. Study Concerning the Social Infrastructure Upon Which  Introduction of These Vehicles Is Premised    1) The low-pollution vehicles addressed by this study  committee are hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles, methanol  vehicles and CNG vehicles. Hybrid vehicles are fundamentally  based on light oil-fueled vehicles, and do not require road  transport carriers and others to make new investments in fuel  supply facilities and the like or in related infrastructure.    On the other hand, for electric, methanol and CNG vehicles,  the use of their energy/fuels as fuel for conventional  automobiles had not been foreseen, and so no nationwide supply  system for them as automotive fuel has been established.  Therefore, when road transport carriers have attempted to use  these vehicles, they have had to procure the energy sources, and  in addition, to set up facilities to supply their vehicles on  their own.    Nonetheless, as confirmed by the questionnaire study  conducted as part of this study committee's work, it has been  difficult for urban businesses to add on large-scale fuel  facilities to their company sites, and restrictions on the  further establishment of supply facilities and questions about  how uninterrupted supplies of fuel are going to be secured,  etc., have led to difficulties in expanding the scale of supply  of petroleum-substitute fuels. On the other hand, until these  issues are overcome, the reality is that there can be no clear  awareness that we must use petroleum-substitute-energy vehicles.    For the service stations which sell conventional gasoline,  etc. and which are in the most convenient locations to supply  petroleum-substitute fuels, the situation has been one in which  they have had no confidence whatsoever concerning the volume of  sales that can be anticipated, and whether it can succeed as a  business, and the fact that there has been no choice but to be  negative toward new investment has been a major obstacle from  the standpoint of establishing petroleum-substitute-energy  supply stations.    2) Nonetheless, in light of the very recent rise in concern  about global environmental issues, etc., a major shift in energy  supplier awareness of petroleum-substitute energy supply is  evident. To support this, we cite the report of the  ``Petroleum-Substitute Energy, Energy Supply Systems for  Automobiles Study Committee'' (22 June 1992) which studied  petroleum-substitute energy supply systems with the  participation of the ``National Federation of Petroleum Dealers'  Associations,'' an association of petroleum dealers.    This report:    i) Provides a uniform assessment of the role of  petroleum-substitute-energy vehicles saying, ``they will have  the effect of killing two birds with the same stone by resolving  pressing issues like environmental policies for the reduction of  CO[.sup]2[/] and energy policies on lessening the degree of  dependence on petroleum.''    ii) Adopts an aggressive energy-supply-side attitude,  indicating that ``the relationship between 'alternative-energy  vehicle RD and popularization' and 'the establishment of  energy  supply networks for alternative-energy vehicles' is a 'chicken  and egg' relationship, and until we cut through this dilemma,  rapid popularization of alternative-energy vehicles cannot be  anticipated. Rather, there is a need to establish the role of  both as 'two wheels of the same vehicle' and to promote both in  a systematic, policy-type manner.''    iii) Further mentions the handling of service stations and  states that they should make efforts to be able to handle  automotive energies other than gasoline and light oil (CNG,  methanol, electricity) in the medium-to-long term.    iv) Pointing out that there are dangers with any form of  energy, and in terms of urban disaster prevention, the separate  establishment of supply stations for these respective energies  is not desirable, and that the cost of land is high in urban  areas where the need for alternative-energy stations is great,  and so the cost of establishing alternative-energy stations  could be prohibitive, the report advocates ``that the provision  of infrastructure be undertaken by making use of 60,000 service  stations nationwide.''    The report further clarified the study committee's position  on the provision of infrastructure by indicating in particular  that in using existing service stations, ``we should attempt to  establish alternative-energy stations as model operations for  the first three fiscal years, and for the time being,  policy-type incentives such as subsidies, etc. would appear to  be needed because of the lack of commercial interest.''    In accord with this, the Agency of Natural Resources and  Energy (ANRE) has formulated the ``Environmental Vehicles  Popularization Infrastructure Program (Eco-Station/2000  Program).''    In concise terms, it aims for the establishment of 2,000  ``eco-stations'' by the year 2000; calls for the provision of  about 100 ``eco-stations'' as model operations during the  initial phase of the program, from 1993 through 1995; for  national treasury grants to cover the expenses; and for  nationwide development of the remaining stations from 1996 to  2000 with provision of the required funding through a system of  interest-free loans.    The budget request relating to ``eco-stations'' for FY1993  is  1.8 billion, and a very major step has been taken relating  to the provision of a supply infrastructure for  petroleum-substitute energies.    In other words, in connection with the provision of a supply  network for automotive petroleum-substitute energies, it is safe  to say that, at the very least, there are prospects for a  solution to this issue in the form of facility establishment by  suppliers at a prescribed pace.    Thus, based on current circumstances in which an increase in  the ``number of taps'' is being affirmed, the focus in terms of  the prime issue for road transport carriers relating to the  supply of alternative energies likely will shift to the  questions concerning whether or not supply margins for  petroleum-substitute energies will be stable enough for  automotive markets in the context of world or Japanese domestic  demand, followed by questions concerning how prices will react  once automotive fuel demands are created as new sources of  demand for these energies.    (1) Electric Power Supply    In looking at the supply and demand structure of electric  power which is the motive energy for electric vehicles, one  finds that there are major swings in the course of a single day,  with consumption high during the day and low at night. At the  same time that daytime electric power supply and demand is  growing tighter, the range of fluctuation between day and night  demand is getting bigger from year to year as well.              Graph 5-1. Daily Electric Power Demand Load Curve               Graph 5-2. Changes in the Biggest 3-Day Averages per Month      In the event electric vehicles are popularized in large  numbers, it is anticipated that electric power supplies will  grow all the more tight if things like daytime charging of  electric vehicles and fast-charging, etc. are carried out.  Electric power has superior features, e.g., it is clean and can  be used for a variety of purposes. Conversely, the fact that it  cannot be stored is a drawback. As a result, facility capacity  must be slightly more than peak demand. Consequently, facility  utilization rates (annual amount of electric power output  divided by 8760 hours and then multiplied by 100) tend to be  low, and the generating costs end up being that much higher.    In order to cope with these circumstances, it is necessary  to  attempt to level the load by introducing a system of rates  differentiated by time periods. A time-differentiated-rate  system attempts to facilitate consumer load shifting and to  smooth demand load by establishing different rates for peak-load  and low-load periods.    It will be necessary to encourage the charging of electric  vehicles at night and to smooth out the supply and demand  balance through the introduction of this kind of night rate  system. Also, if low-cost, night-rate charging can be used, it  will contribute to improved electric vehicle energy costs, and  so this too will serve to promote their popularization.    First of all, development of an electric vehicle  fast-charging system is to be initiated this fiscal year using a  new type of battery power storage system (making effective use  of nighttime power output by storing it and then using it for  charging demand during the day) being developed by the New  Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization  (NEDO). In addition, in order to promote the popularization of  electric, methanol and CNG vehicles, MITI has announced an  ``eco-station'' program to establish 2,000 stations by the year  2000 which will supply electricity and natural gas, and is  studying the provision of subsidies beginning in 1993 to be used  to cover the costs of remodeling existing gas stations.    Thus, while the provision of infrastructure for the use of  electric vehicles is inadequate, it is possible to make the  assessment that steady progress is being made.    (2) Methanol Supply and Demand    First of all, in looking at the international supply and  demand for methanol, current estimated annual worldwide demand  is approximately a little less than 20 million tons, around  80%  of the sustainable supply (approximately 23 million tons). In  terms of regions, supply capacity is great in North America and  Eastern Europe, while demand is great in North America and  Western Europe.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chart 5-3.

Graph 5-4. Methanol Uses (Worldwide Basis)      Next, if one looks at the CIF (cost, insurance, freight)  price of refined methanol as an indicator for understanding the  methanol supply and demand situation in Japan, considerable  fluctuation from year to year is evident as shown in Graph 5-5.  This demonstrates instability in the supply and demand structure.              Graph 5-5. Changes in Methanol Production, Import and CIF               Graph 5-6. Changes in Methanol Demand and Price       The raw material for methanol itself is natural gas, and  there is general consensus on the point that there is no need  for concern about a shortage in the supply of natural gas.  Therefore, it seems there is no need to consider a shortage in  methanol feedstock as a factor in future supply and demand  instability.    On the contrary, current price fluctuations are the primary  cause of supply and demand imbalances. The methanol production  industry is a typical process industry, and when a methanol  plant is expanded it is on the scale of 600-700,000 tons per  plant; in other words, expansion is conducted on the order  3%  of the global supply capacity. When demand rises, given the  comparatively high operating rates of current facilities, price  jumps occur easily, and this promotes strong motivation to  increase production facility capacity, but after capacity  increases, it creates noticeable surplus capacity once a decline  in demand occurs, leaving a market structure susceptible to  ``pig cycle'' types of price fluctuations in which prices slump.    In addition, at present, there is no consensus on which  types  of service vehicles M85 and M100 respectively are going to be  used for, and, as indicated in connection with this point by the  ``Energy Supply Systems for Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles  Study Committee'' mentioned earlier, ``comprehensive study is  needed, to include the social and economic aspects, and not just  the technical aspects.''    In any event, if one takes the long view, it will likely  require efforts to establish a stable supply and demand  relationship which is independent of supply and demand for  chemical-feedstock methanol in order to secure stable supplies  of methanol as an automotive fuel.    On top of that, because of properties like the formation of  combustible, explosive gas compounds and invisible inflammation,  etc., methanol is regulated by the Fire Protection Law, the  Poisonous and Deleterious Substances Control Law, and the Labor  Safety and Health Law, and since there must not be any  discharges outside the systems of use, if widespread  popularization with ordinary users is anticipated, it is  conceivable that revisions of the relevant laws and ordinances  or the creation of new standards will become necessary.    Natural Gas Supply and Demand    First of all, in looking at the supply and demand structure  of natural gas which is the motive energy of CNG vehicles, we  learned that the worldwide demand for natural gas in 1990 was 1  trillion 931 billion cubic meters, a 2% increase over the  year  before. The former Soviet Union and Central Europe accounted for  approximately 40% of the overall consumption. Total global  production volume in 1990 was 1 trillion 957.1 billion cubic  meters, a 2% increase over the year before. The former  Soviet  Union produces approximately 40% of the world's total and  the  U.S. approximately 25%. The former Soviet Union in  particular  has greatly expanded its production, approximately four-fold  over the last 25 years.    With natural gas there is little emission of SOx and NOx,  and  even the emission volume of CO[.sup]2[/], which is a cause of  global warming, and is 70% that of petroleum and  60% that of  coal when combusted. Therefore, it is evaluated highly as a fuel  in terms of environmental considerations.    Also, in terms of supply, it is stable in comparison with  other fuels. The resource supply nations are widely distributed  in places like the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia, etc.,  and there are 12 years more proven reserves than there are for  petroleum. Japan depends on the Middle East for 6% of its  natural gas supply, very low compared to 70% for its oil  supply.    In view of these facts, natural gas appears to be a  desirable  petroleum-substitute fuel for transport.              Graph 5-7. Composition of Proven Reserves of Natural Gas               Graph 5-8. Composition of Proven Reserves of Natural Gas      Natural gas demand is forecast to grow 3% annually  until the  year 2000. Petroleum demand, on the other hand, will grow at an  annual rate of 1.5%. Under the circumstances with  environmental  issues and the like, energy demand in Europe has begun to shift  rapidly to natural gas. There are prospects that by the year  2010, the ratio accounted for by natural gas for all energy  sources, including petroleum and coal, will expand from the  current 15% to 30%.    In terms of supply as well, with the collapse of the Soviet  Union, which has been the leading supplier nation up to now,  development is now under way with western capital. Furthermore,  the Middle East, which accounts for 30% of total  reserves, is  being counted upon to satisfy the increase in demand, and the  probability of stable supply is growing.    (Infrastructure Establishment)    The biggest obstacles to natural gas being used for vehicles  are the establishment of a supply infrastructure and especially,  the securing of supply for the ``eco-stations.''    In Japan the areas which have natural gas pipelines  installed  and which are being supplied are limited to large cities and  their environs and domestic natural gas producing areas such as  Shinkata, Akita and Chiba, etc. The concept of a pipeline  traversing the whole country (targeted completion in 2010) and  the like have been rumored, but in any event, Japan is in no  position to develop a pipeline network right away.    Within the currently supplied areas there is the possibility  of using the existing pipelines for terminal distribution, and  it is conceivable that refueling facilities for CNG vehicles  could be established with relative ease.              Graph 5-9. Town Gas Supply Areas Which Supply Natural Gas      At present, six CNG dedicated stations have been established  nationwide and are being used to supply fuel to CNG vehicles  owned by the gas companies. CNG refueling is rapid and timed,  and the refueling technology has been proven overseas. The  development and establishment of compact, rapid refueling  facilities (compressor and dispenser) is a pressing matter, and  in Japan a 3-year project was started in FY1992 with an AIST  subsidy for the ``development of practical NGV refueling  equipment,'' and needed infrastructural technology is being  readied for mass popularization.    Furthermore, in order to popularize CNG vehicles, relevant  legal system revisions and the like will be sought. The revision  of the High-Pressure Gas Control Law and the establishment of  vehicle technical standards, etc., and various types of  environmental apparatus directed toward mass popularization have  become urgent matters.              Graph 5-10. LNG Plants in Japan      VI. Estimates of Costs To Introduce and Operate  Low-Pollution Vehicles    1) At this juncture we are going to make estimates of the  introductory and operating costs for the hybrid, electric,  methanol and CNG vehicles which are to be targeted for   introduction by the road transport carriers, bearing in mind  analyses of the studies cited earlier and the like. The object  of these cost estimates is to enable forecasting concerning such  issues as how big a burden would be imposed on these businesses  if they introduce and operate the vehicles in question, and if  various types of support policies are devised, how effective  would they be?    In order to establish more realistic premises and take into  account the features, etc. of each of the vehicle types, the  estimate premises are not necessarily common to all, but the  basic cost framework was made common to all. Thus, before  getting into the estimates for each of the low-pollution  vehicles, we will sort out the common premises.    The following items are offered as common premises or  thinking:    (1) We used estimated prices formulated on the basis of data  on the various vehicle types provided by the auto industry of  Japan as a premise of study by this study committee, and on the  basis of investigative hearings with associated industry groups  and enterprises.    (2) It is assumed that fuel is to be procured from  ``eco-stations'' and the like. Note: We will explain fuel price  later on as well, but because it is difficult to accurately  predict, as a premise of this exercise, we formulated and used  uniform-estimate values.    (3) Expense accumulation items were placed in six areas:  vehicle price; maintenance costs; fuel costs; operating costs;  infrastructure and facility costs; and education and training  costs.    (4) To evaluate low-pollution vehicle introduction costs, we  used the method of comparing the total costs of the accounting  period, which totals the initial costs (vehicle price,  automobile acquisition tax, etc.) and operating expenses (fuel  costs, expendable items, interest payments, etc.), and the  average annual costs with those for current base vehicles.    In estimating the introductory and operating costs of  low-pollution vehicles using premises such as these, we found  that with a simple purchase case, assuming average service life,  the average annual operating cost in the case of a hybrid  vehicle is 1.51-1.89 million/year, equivalent to 1.3-1.7  times current vehicle costs. For a methanol vehicle, it is  1.23-1.89 million/year, equivalent to 1.4-2.1 times current  vehicle costs. For a CNG vehicle, it is 1.12-1.73  million/year, equivalent to 1.3-2.0 times current vehicle costs.    Given the road transport carrier operating structure  outlined  in Chapter 2, it is difficult to view these as cost levels  supporting autonomous popularization. Therefore, in order to  lower these operating cost levels, various types of support  policies will be devised, and we have assumed a variety of  options, presented below, as the principal thinking on handling  policies.    (1) Lowering financing costs in order to reduce the cost of  procuring the new vehicles. As operating premises of this study  committee, the use of fiscal-investment-and-loan-type special  interest loans, and a financing ratio of 50% are assumed.  Also,  regardless of the source of funding, implementation of some sort  of grant for paying at a fixed rate of interest is assumed.  Specifically, reference is made to the system of interest  subsidies relating to purchase funding for vehicles conforming  to the latest regulations with transport industry promotional  subsidies.    (2) Lowering initial introductory costs in view of the low  financing capacity of medium and small-sized firms. As an  operating premise of this study committee, we assumed the use of  leases in combination with fiscal investment and loans.    (3) Incorporation of credit supplementing measures since  medium and small-sized firms are short on credit resources. As  operating premises of this study committee, in the event these  are used in combination with a lease system, the introduction of  a system in which business cooperative associations stand surety  for money loaned and the lowering of lease rates are assumed.    (4) Endeavoring to lower the per-year cost burden by  devising  incentives in connection with corporate taxes, etc. As an  operating premise of this study committee, allowing a tax  deduction equivalent to 7% of the basic lease fee (total  amount  of the lease fees x 60%) for companies using a lease  system,  similar to ``MITI's Medium and Small-Sized Enterprise New  Technology Promotion Tax System (known as the Mechatronics Tax  System),'' is assumed.    (5) Allowance to use incentives in connection with all other  vehicle taxes. As an operating premise of this study committee,  reduction of the vehicle acquisition tax, and vehicle tax is  assumed.    2) Note: Electric vehicles, as mentioned when we presented  their technical features, are particularly superior in terms of  their lack of exhaust and quietness, and they are generally  recognized as the ultimate expression of the non-polluting  automotive vehicle of the future. Development efforts to date  have focused on vehicles in the ``light automobile'' class  because of the relationship to the issue of the capacity of  current storage batteries. For this reason, in the 2-ton  commercial vehicle class which is considered necessary for the  actual introduction of low-pollution vehicles by the road  transport carriers, development is still in the stage where  demonstration vehicles have begun to be provided for trial  operation.    For the electric vehicle itself, as stated earlier,  extensive  technical component development still remains to be done on  storage batteries and in other areas. Also, technology  development aimed at making the important peripheral electric  vehicle equipment, the recharging facilities, more inexpensive  is needed.    Thus, a lot of hope is riding on the potential for future  component technology development for the 2-ton class electric  vehicles, and given the cost estimates, including operating  costs, based on the price for the trial manufactured 2-ton  vehicles, the majority of the committee feel it is still too  early, and so we will forego specific estimates on these at this  juncture.    3) Also, estimating the ``costs'' of petroleum-substitute  energies proved extremely difficult; although it is relatively  simple to get a handle on the comparative costs for electricity  and CNG (the price for LNG, the feedstock material, is set by  long-term contracts), there are many elements of uncertainty,  not to mention methanol, which as was pointed out in the report  of the ``Study Committee for Energy Supply Systems for  Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles'' cited earlier, ``is one  of the feedstock materials for MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl  ether) in which there is heightened interest as a gasoline  component, and research study on future supply and demand trends  is needed.''    Consequently, as an operating premise of this study  committee, for fuels in which the related enterprises have some  degree of responsibility for supply prices, we made reference to  the price estimates of those enterprises, and for those fuels  for which no such circumstances exist, we estimated supply  prices on the premise that the fuel costs per kilometer of  travel would not be cheaper than those for petroleum-derivative  fuels.    1. Hybrid Vehicle Cost Estimates    Cost category content for the introduction and operation of  hybrid vehicles is as shown below. It is assumed that by  employing energy regeneration, hybrid vehicles will have better  fuel consumption rates than existing vehicles, and that some of  the introductory costs will be recovered with lower operating  costs. Note: For maintenance costs, we used the estimates of the  Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Also, given the  technical features of the hybrid vehicle, there is no need for  the provision of new infrastructure, and since instruction and  training can be handled in a very few days, the decision was  made to disregard those costs in these estimates.    These estimates are premised on a 4-ton truck and a  large-model route bus as the test hybrid vehicles. With respect  to the former, the establishment of a 2-ton class, compact  vehicle was studied out of consideration for the realities of  truck usage in urban areas, but in taking into account the  technical features of the hybrid vehicle and the current stage  of technical development, etc., the committee decided to premise  the estimates on the highly feasible 4-ton vehicle. For the bus,  we targeted the large-model route bus which already has a track  record as a test vehicle and for which there are a great many  units in use. Note: Taking into account economies of scale  depending on the scale of manufacturing, we established a 2-tier  price structure for the vehicle prices. Also, we adopted a  10-year and 13-year service life for the trucks and buses  respectively based on data of the Vehicle Inspection and  Registration Association. Travel distances were set at 35,000  km/year for trucks and 60,000 km/year for buses on the basis of  the results of the questionnaire which was sent to the Tokyo  Trucking Association and existing statistical data. Using  existing experimental data, etc. as a reference, the rate of  energy regeneration was calculated at 20%.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Estimated Costs (Hybrid Vehicles)                                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cost Categories                       |Estimate Premises                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vehicle Price                         |Establish per unit price based on dat-|  |                                      |a, etc. of the Japan Automobile Manuf-|  |                                      |acturers Association.

First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in  contrast to an average annual cost of 1.14 million for  existing trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type  assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of  100 units is 1.99 million, just under twice that of current  vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 5,000 units,  the average annual introduction and operating cost falls to  1.51 million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles.  However, as it stands, it is hard to believe that hybrid  vehicles are going to be popularized with road transport  carriers.    Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction  measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average  annual cost drops to 1.44 million with an annual production  level of 5,000 units, and if a lease system which incorporates  fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, that cost falls  to 1.32 million. Furthermore, if a fixed-rate-interest  subsidy is added on, the average annual cost is lowered to  1.27 million, 1.11 times the current average annual vehicle  cost. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance  measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the  disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around 130,000  per year.    The same holds true for hybrid buses as well, required costs  swell in comparison to existing vehicles. Compared with trucks,  the vehicle price disparity between existing buses and  low-pollution buses is relatively small, and so the disparity in  cost with existing vehicles ends up being the limiting factor.  If it is assumed that all support measures are possible, and if  annual production expands to 1,000 units, that cost disparity  will shrink completely to a mere 70,000 in average annual  cost, and so substitution for current vehicles can be  anticipated within existing frameworks for new vehicle  replacements.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Methanol Vehicle Cost Estimates    Introductory and operating cost categories for methanol  vehicles are shown below.    For maintenance cost estimates, we used the estimates of the  Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. To calculate fuel  costs, we established fuel consumption and fuel price, and  multiplied those with the annual mileage. Methanol vehicles make  the provision of new refueling facility infrastructure  necessary. As stated earlier, accurate estimates of fuel prices  are difficult, and so we made our estimates on the premise that  ``fuel costs per kilometer of travel will not be less than that  for other petroleum-derived fuels.'' Also M100 was assumed as  the fuel standard.    Estimates are premised on a 2-ton truck and large-model  route  bus as the trial methanol vehicles. The large-model route bus  was chosen because a test vehicle track record already exists  and a large number of units are in service. Note: Taking into  account economies of scale depending on the scale of production,  we established a 3-tier vehicle price estimate structure for the  trucks and a 2-tier vehicle price estimate structure for the  buses. Also, we adopted a 10-year and 13-year service life for  the trucks and buses respectively, based on data of the Vehicle  Inspection and Registration Association.

First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in  contrast to an average annual cost of 880,000 for existing  trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type  assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of  100 units is 1.89 million, more than twice that of current  vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 1,000 units,  the average annual introduction and operating cost falls to  1.55 million, around 1.8 times that of existing vehicles.  If annual production is expanded to 10,000 units, the average  annual cost for introduction and operation falls to 1.23  million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles. However, as  it stands, it is hard to believe that methanol vehicles are  going to be popularized with road transport carriers.    Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction  measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average  annual cost falls to 1.19 million on the basis of an annual  production level of 10,000 units, and if a lease system which  incorporates fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, the  cost falls to 1.13 million. Furthermore, if a  fixed-rate-interest subsidy (3%) is added, the average  annual  cost is lowered to 1.06 million, 1.2 times that of existing  vehicles. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance  measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the  disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around 180,000  per year.    In looking at methanol buses, similar to the trucks, the  required costs also swell in comparison to existing vehicles.  Compared with trucks, the expendable item cost for existing  buses and the low-pollution buses are relatively small, and so  the cost disparity with existing vehicles will shrink. However,  even with all policy support measures (fixed-rate-interest grant  of 3%), and production expanded to 1,000 units, the  lowest the  average annual cost will fall is approximately 1.12 times that  of existing vehicles, over 440,000.

CNG Vehicle Cost Estimates    Cost categories for introducing and operating CNG vehicles  are as shown below.    For maintenance cost estimates we used the estimates of the  Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. To calculate fuel  costs, we established fuel consumption and fuel price, and  multiplied those with the annual mileage.    CNG vehicles make the provision of new refueling facility  infrastructure necessary. As stated earlier, accurate estimates  of fuel prices are difficult, and so we used a price formulated  using the prices estimated by the Japan Gas Association as  reference.    Estimates are premised on a 2-ton truck and a large-model  route bus as the trial CNG vehicles. The large-model route bus  was chosen because a large number of units are in use. Note:  Taking into account economies of scale depending on the scale of  production, we established a 3-tier price estimate structure for  the trucks and a 2-tier price estimate structure for the buses.  Also, we adopted a 10-year and 13-year service life for the  trucks and buses respectively, based on data of the Vehicle  Inspection and Registration Association. Travel distances were  set at 35,000 km/year for trucks and 60,000 km/year for buses on  the basis of the results of the questionnaire which was sent to  the Japan Trucking Association and existing statistical data.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cost Estimate Categories (CNG Vehicles)                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cost Category                         |Estimate Premises                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vehicle price                         |Per-unit prices established on the ba-|  |                                      |sis of data of the Japan Automobile M-|  |                                      |anufacturers Association, etc. and on |  |                                      |investigative hearings, etc. with rel-|  |                                      |ated industry associations and enterp-|  |                                      |rises.

First of all, if we look at the figures for trucks, in  contrast to an average annual cost of 880,000 for existing  trucks, for a simple purchase case, without policy-type  assistance measures, the cost at an annual production level of  100 units is 1.73 million, a little less than twice that of  current vehicle cost. If annual production is expanded to 1,000  units, the average annual introduction and operating cost falls  to 1.31 million, around 1.5 times that of existing  vehicles. If annual production is expanded to 10,000 units, the  average annual cost for introduction and operation falls to  1.12 million, around 1.3 times that of existing vehicles.  However, as it stands, it is hard to believe that CNG vehicles  are going to be popularized with road transport carriers.    Accordingly, when automobile and corporate tax reduction  measures are taken as steps to promote popularization, average  annual cost falls to 1.08 million on the basis of an annual  production level of 10,000 units, and if a lease system which  incorporates fiscal-investment-and-loan financing is added, the  cost falls to 1.02 million. Furthermore, if a  fixed-rate-interest subsidy (3%) is added, the average  annual  cost is lowered to 960,000, 1.09 times that of existing  vehicles. Thus, with complete commitment of the main assistance  measures assumed initially, it is possible to shrink the  disparity in cost with existing vehicles to around 80,000  per year.    In looking at CNG buses the same holds true, the required  costs also swell in comparison to existing vehicles. Compared  with trucks, the expendable item cost for existing buses and the  low-pollution buses are relatively small, and so this will  shrink the cost disparity with existing vehicles. However, even  with all policy support measures (fixed-rate-interest subsidy of  3%), and production expanded to 1,000 units, CNG buses  will be  cheaper than existing buses, and it is to be anticipated that  they will replace existing vehicles within the new vehicle  replacement frameworks already in place.

implementation basis) conducted under a prescribed set of  conditions from the standpoint of making a comparison with  existing diesel vehicles, annual costs are expected to rise  respectively by 130,000 for a hybrid vehicle (4-ton  carrying capacity), 180,000 for a methanol vehicle (2-ton  carrying capacity), and 80,000 for a CNG vehicles (2-ton  carrying capacity).    Similarly, for buses, annual costs are expected to rise by  70,000 for hybrid vehicles, and by 440,000 for  methanol vehicles, but conversely, for CNG vehicles a cost  reduction on the order of 30,000 is anticipated.    2) In order to endeavor to popularize these low-pollution  vehicles even further, the key will be whether or not it is  possible to find factors which will allow us to shrink these  cost disparities.    First of all are the prices of the hybrid/methanol/CNG  vehicles assumed within these estimates. Particularly, given the  far shorter history of technology development on vehicles which  use petroleum-substitute fuels than that for diesel vehicles,  when compared to these engines which are ``more tempered'' by  the demands of the market, it is no exaggeration to say that  engines which use petroleum-substitute fuels are still under  development. It is possible that in the future, as a result of  cooperation between users and manufacturers, far more usable  engines than those currently available and, in turn, more easy  than at present for road transport carriers to use, and vehicles  priced lower than the current estimates will become available.    Second, financing cost reduction is possible. Current  estimates for hybrid vehicles assume an annual fixed-rate  interest subsidy of 1%, but, for example, in a case in  which  the introductory number of units is relatively low, it is  probably possible to assume higher and more liberal  fixed-rate-interest subsidies similar to those for methanol and  CNG vehicles.    Also, Japan Development Bank special-interest-rate financing  is assumed in the estimates for all three types of vehicles, but  there is a high probability of further cost reductions in the  area of funding procurement, e.g., the opportunity for the  parties introducing these vehicles to take advantage of  preferential interest rates available for medium and small-sized  enterprises, and further, in the case of using imported  vehicles, the opportunity to take advantage of the Import-Export  Bank of Japan product import financing system (interest:  5.3%  at financing rate of 70% of item cost).    Third, there is the importance of further ingenuity in terms  of the use of all three vehicles types by the road transport  carriers actually using these low-pollution vehicles. In the  case of hybrid vehicles in particular, it is conceivable that  transport costs will decline due to improvements to the  relatively conservative mileage estimates as these enterprises  secure more adequate operational stability and implement more  efficient operating plans.    Also, methanol and CNG vehicles have feature flexibility in  terms of carrying capacity, mileage and chassis design by  varying the energy density of their respective fuels and by  changing their fuel-carrying methods. As a result, it is also  possible that when we attempt to fully demonstrate the  respective features, we will end up with more ingenious vehicles  in terms of capacity, etc., than those premised in these  estimates.    In addition, in the case of CNG vehicles, the  ``eco-stations'' which are likely to be developed will have the  feature of being completely limited to the areas supplied by  Tokyo Gas, Toho Gas and Osaka Gas for the immediate future.    It is likely that individual road transport carriers will  devise ways to absorb cost increases by using the features  illustrated earlier and making them conform sufficiently to  performance demanded in response to the characteristics of their  customers.    With the accumulation of such efforts and ingenuity by the  parties concerned, effectively combined with tax incentives,  fiscal investment and loans, and the like, we probably can  expect to be able to promote the introduction of hybrid,  methanol and CNG vehicles.    3) As mentioned earlier, no matter how difficult they have  been to build, the history of low-pollution vehicles is still a  brief one. Compared to vehicles with diesel engines which have a  long tradition as commercial vehicle engines, one can  justifiably argue that low-pollution vehicles which use  petroleum-substitute fuels in particular are under development.  As long as current circumstances prevail, users cannot choose to  bear the burden of full-scale introduction on their own, nor can  manufacturers decide to undertake adequate RD investment, or  facility investment at their own risk. Just as they are for  structuring issues on the energy supplier side mentioned in the  report of the ``Energy Supply Systems for  Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles Study Committee,'' the  problems in introducing low-pollution vehicles are also  inherently ``chicken or egg'' issues.    In order to come up with breakthroughs on these issues, road  users, starting with the road transport carriers, should  formulate ``long-term targets for the introduction of  low-pollution vehicles'' individually and in step with the  response of their associated industry, and then strive for  steady introduction on the basis of those objectives.    In particular, if national and local-level government  organizations make use of these vehicles as part of their  operations, it goes without saying that they should set their  own ``targets'' to serve as models for others, and then lead the  private sector by steadily meeting these targets.    Also, the national government should approve the application  of measures to support their introduction cited earlier only for  those businesses which have clarified these ``targets,'' and  should consider eligibility in such a way that they do not  discourage road users, beginning with road transport carriers.  Steps should be devised so that these ``targets'' do not act  simply as triggers for eligibility for these support  measures.    The following idea is an example of such a step.    Customarily, whether it is a low-pollution vehicle or a  regular vehicle, when it comes to a choice between a vehicle  that has been on the market for several years or one that is  just hitting the market, the one that has been tried and tested  by the market will be the superior vehicle in terms of  performance and price, etc. Therefore, one idea is to lower the  burden and risk for those enterprises attempting to introduce  these vehicles ahead of other enterprises by, for example,  approving the application of support measures for road transport  carriers attempting to introduce ``low-pollution vehicles''  which have not been on the market long, even if their  ``targets'' call for a relatively low proportion of  ``low-pollution vehicles'' among the vehicles they possess,  while requiring a fairly high rate of introduction of these  vehicles to be eligible for support measures after a prescribed  period of time has elapsed and vehicle assessments concluded,  etc.    As for methods of using introduction targets, even aside  from  elements which must await government administrative review  because of issues relating to utilization of tax incentives and  fiscal investment and loans, clarifying these long-term  introduction targets can be expected to have the reverberating  effect of enabling automobile manufacturers to define demand  estimates, making it possible to lower marketing-associated  risks even further.    VII. In Conclusion    (1) In our study through chapter 6, we have pointed out that  the possibilities for improving the operating costs and speeding  up the pace of popularization of low-pollution vehicles increase  by devising a series of support policies like tax and fiscal  investment and loan incentives as well as schemes to make use of  them, etc.    In the event the introduction of low-pollution vehicles is  facilitated as a result of regional features, etc., in addition  to policies such as these, which ought to be characterized as  uniform national minimums, it is preferable that the incentive  measures be added on region by region.    Similarly, from the standpoint of alternate energy policy,  although not policy in direct support of low-pollution vehicles,  the formulation of any sort of support measures is welcome. As  long as they are conducive to the popularization of  ``low-pollution vehicles,'' it is probably preferable to need to  make active use of these policy measures from separate  perspectives.    (2) As explained a number of times, road transport carriers  have adopted the position that there need to be guarantees for  the systems from which supplies of energy for  petroleum-substitute-energy-type low-pollution vehicles are to  be received. The position of the energy suppliers on the other  hand, is likely to be that clear estimates of the amount of  demand and guarantees to cover facility investment risks are  needed.    In order to put a stop to this kind of endless debate, the  ``Energy Supply Systems for Petroleum-Substitute-Energy Vehicles  Study Committee'' introduced earlier has stated that an  ``Eco-Station 2000'' program should be put together and the  support, etc. it requires implemented.    The formulation of support policies such as these in itself  would be welcomed as being truly opportune. If we were to take  it upon ourselves to assume the position of a business actually  operating vehicles and point to this program, the first priority  naturally would go to the metropolitan areas, especially those  which are subject to NOx laws and regulations, as investing  parties in low-pollution vehicles which they themselves would  use. Therefore, in attempting to invest in vehicles which use  petroleum-substitute energies, it would be desirable that the  stations supplying the petroleum-substitute energies, i.e., the  ``eco-stations,'' be concentrated in the metropolitan areas, and  on the major artery roads closely linked with them. Also, there  appears to be a great need on the part of the energy suppliers  like the petroleum retailers, etc. to get a handle on vehicle  upgrading trends of the road transport carriers.    Therefore, in order to formulate future targets for the  corporate introduction of petroleum-substitute-energy-type  low-pollution vehicles, it is necessary for those on the user  side, beginning with the road transport carriers, and those on  the energy supplier side, the petroleum retailers, et al., to  come up with estimates for the supply and demand of  petroleum-substitute fuels that range into the future. There is  an especially great need to come up with estimates between the  enterprises and the energy suppliers, the petroleum retailers,  et. al., on the amount of supply required in the event the use  of petroleum-substitute-fuel vehicles is attempted, even if only  in those areas subject to NOx laws and regulations. The issues  straddle the jurisdictions of several ministries and agencies,  but a forum to study supply and demand ought to be established  through the cooperation of the administrative parties. As stated  earlier, it is of course conceivable that in the initial stages  of use of low-pollution vehicles, a certain amount of problems  with the convenience of use will surface. And, some types of  product complaints need to be fed back steadily to the  manufacturers.    This kind of steady feedback in itself has the ability to  bring about progress toward a more ``user-friendly'' vehicle,  and conversely, provide automobile manufacturers with know-how  and new technical data relating to the use of low-pollution  vehicles, and as a result, stimulate even wider demand for  low-pollution vehicles.    It will probably be necessary to secure points of interface  of this kind between users and manufacturers in some form.  Normally, this role is played by the sales and service  departments of automobile dealerships, but it seems that if  several manufacturers build a specific type of ``low-pollution  vehicle,'' as much sharing of their technical data as possible  would lead to an effective use of precious manpower.    Also, low-pollution vehicles have many points of difference  with existing automobiles, particularly in terms of upgrading  and maintenance, etc., and will require mastery of unique  technology, particularly in the initial stages of introduction.  For this reason, in using the lease system which this study  committee made a premise of its review, we should consider  extending it to a maintenance lease, rather than limiting it to  a financing lease, so that along with serving the convenience of  the road transport carriers who will be the users of the  low-pollution vehicles, it will be possible to use these leases  as the point of interface between the manufacturers and the road  transport carriers for upgrading and maintenance data and other  data.    (4) Although tentative proposals have already been made  regarding the handling of low-pollution vehicles in terms of  taxes, it is probably going to be necessary to consider the  optimum methods of implementing various automobile-related taxes  and fuel taxes as long-term issues needing further study.    For example, there is the issue of the automobile weight  tax.  This problem is directly manifested in electric vehicles, and  even if excessive weight increase from storage batteries or the  weight increase from the accumulator and storage battery  apparatus in hybrid vehicles, the so-called ``tonnage  reduction'' issue, is cleared up through the application of  design ingenuity, rises in vehicle weight tax are unavoidable,  and so without some sort of consideration, it is inevitable that  this tax will be a source of cost increase for users of these  vehicles.    Also, within this report, we have addressed the issue of  terminal sales price in connection with petroleum-substitute  fuels, and we have kept issues pertaining to intermediate-stage  taxation completely outside the purview of our study. Hereafter,  having taken into consideration how they would conform with the  series of policies aimed at bringing about low-pollution  automobile traffic, and with promoting the introduction of  petroleum-substitute energies, it likely will be necessary to  study the best way to handle the imposition of taxes.    (5) Furthermore, in order to confer social approval on the  use of low-pollution vehicles, active consideration ought to be  given by the appropriate parties to establishing conditions for  their use such as devising measures like affording priority to  low-pollution vehicles in public parking facilities, or setting  preferential toll road usage fees for low-pollution vehicles, or  providing standardization and certification systems, etc.    In addition to that, active responses will be needed through  the mutual cooperation of the industries concerned and  cooperation with local governing bodies, etc. in connection with  the extensive activities required to enable the smooth future  popularization of low-pollution vehicles, e.g., the work of  enlightening those concerned who benefit from the uses of road  traffic, general consumers, shippers, etc., on the significance  of using low-pollution vehicles, and improving the ability of  the automobile-related industries to understand technology  development trends, etc., which is needed to form a consensus  that the ``cost increases'' which cannot be further eliminated  should be borne by society as a whole by formulating tax and  fiscal investment and loan incentives.    (6) As indicated above, there is a considerable amount of  work requiring close, mutual cooperation between automobile  manufacturers and road users, and between road users and fuel  suppliers. These various tasks require in particular the  establishment of some type of fora for consultations on the  formulation of low-pollution vehicle introduction targets by  individual enterprises, for consultations with the petroleum  retailers, and for consultation with the automobile  manufacturers. Naturally, it is conceivable that a variety of  methods could be used to establish these kinds of fora.    For now, the establishment of a ``Low-Pollution Vehicle  Popularization Forum'' (tentative name) with government  cooperation as a forum to allow the relatively ``soft''  undertaking of collective, timely exchanges of manufacturer,  user, and petroleum retailer information, and above all, direct  contact and discussion of low-pollution vehicle issues by these  three parties are likely to be an effective ``first step.''    Item (6) stated above is a proposal designed to supplement  support policies for the popularization of low-pollution  vehicles. In addition to ancillary measures like this, even more  difficult issues remain to be dealt with as far as things that  should be done to protect the environment in terms of road  traffic are concerned, e.g., on top of upgrading the road  network, making the flow of traffic smoother, and the  distribution of goods more efficient. We would again point out  the need for greater effort by the parties concerned.    (Reference Data)    Given the fact that it seems the price in the initial stage  of low-pollution vehicle introduction have to be high compared  to their price in the stage of full-scale popularization, and  that there are aspects of insecurity relating to marketability  for the manufacturers, we need to lower the risks for users for  the initial stage in which specific low-pollution vehicles are  thrust into the market. Furthermore, more than 80% of  trucking  firms are medium-to-small-sized enterprises, and in light of  their funds availability and credit circumstances, the  introduction of relatively expensive low-pollution vehicles is  going to require policy incentives.    In terms of specific support measures for enterprises and  individuals shifting purchases to low-pollution vehicles: (1)  tax incentives such as reducing vehicle tax and vehicle  acquisition tax, and corporate and individual income tax  deductions, etc.; (2) the use of fiscal investment and loans;  and (3) the use of a lease system, etc. are being considered. In  addition, (4) a fixed-rate-interest subsidy from the Japan  Trucking Association; support measures from local governing  bodies; and (6) other indirect support measures are conceivable  as well.    (1) Tax Incentives    Automobile Tax (Local Tax)    - Extending (the period applicable) the measure to reduce  the  rate of the automobile tax for electric vehicles (applying the  rate prior to the FY1984 tax revision) to FY1993 and FY1994    - Extending (the period applicable) the measure to reduce  the  rate of the automobile tax for methanol vehicles (applying the  rate prior to the FY1984 tax revision) to FY1993 and FY1994    -Establishing a measure to reduce the rate of the automobile  tax for hybrid vehicles (applying the rate prior to the FY1984  tax revision) for FY1993 and FY1994 (period applicable)    - Reducing the vehicle tax by to half for 12 months  following  a purchase when a diesel vehicle (truck or bus) manufactured  prior to conformance with the 1979 exhaust gas regulations is  scrapped and replaced with a new vehicle conforming to the  latest regulations for FY1990 and FY1991 (period applicable)    Vehicle Acquisition Tax (Local Tax)    - Presently 5% of acquisition price for private  vehicles and  3% for business vehicles    - Extending (the period applicable) the 2% reduction  in the  acquisition tax applied to methanol vehicles to FY1993 and FY1994    - Establishing a new measure to reduce the acquisition tax  2% for hybrid vehicles for FY1993 and FY1994 (the period  applicable)    - Providing 1% reduction when a diesel vehicle  (truck or  bus) manufactured prior to conformance with the 1979 exhaust gas  regulations is scrapped and replaced with a new vehicle  conforming to the latest regulations for FY1990 and FY1991.    Corporate Tax (National Tax)    - Will implement tax incentives against the nominal price of  a vehicle in line with those in MITI's system of tax measures to  promote new technology investment by medium and small  enterprises (known as the Mechatronic Tax System) and its system  of tax measures to promote investment to deal with changes in  energy and the environment (known as the Energy and Environment  Tax System)    (For reference) MITI System of Tax Measures To Promote New  Technology System Investment by Medium and Small Enterprises  (popularly referred to as the Mechatronic Tax System)    - Authorizes a special depreciation for medium and small  enterprise purchases of the latest mechatronic equipment,  30%  over the ordinary depreciation for that business year  (36% for  imported equipment), or a corporate tax credit (on purchases  above 1.6 million per unit, up to 20% of the amount  of  corporate tax) of 7% of the revenue tax (8.4% for  imported  equipment)    - For leases as well, in addition to allowing lease fees to  be treated as deductible, as a method of reducing taxes, it is  possible under the Mechatronic Tax System to take a tax  deduction of 7% of the basic lease charge (total lease  fees x  60%).    (For reference) Tax System To Promote Investment To Handle  Changes in Energy and the Environment (popularly referred to as  the Energy and Environment Tax System)    - Authorizes a special depreciation of 30% for that  business  year on purchases of equipment to counter energy and  environmental changes (of more than 1.6 million for things  like vehicle internal combustion engines which conform to the  FY1990 automobile exhaust gas regulations, etc.), or a corporate  tax credit of 7% of the acquisition amount (up to  20% of the  corporate tax amount for that fiscal year)    - Authorizes under depreciated amounts to be carried forward  for 1 year    (2) Use of Fiscal Investment and Loans    - Enable the use of low interest loans from the Japan  Development Bank and the Small Business Finance Corporation to  obtain vehicles (interest rate long-term prime rate minus  0.5-0.8%)    (3) Use of Lease System    If a lease system is used, the leasing company assumes the  burden for the funding to purchase the low-pollution vehicle and  the user gets by with just paying a monthly lease fee. A further  advantage to leasing is that the full amount of the cost of the  item can be treated as deductible within the period of the  lease. Consequently, if the lease period is shorter than the  legal service life (within the limits of Ministry of Finance  notification), it has the effect of saving taxes. Also, since  cost is centralized in the monthly lease fee, it is simple to  get a handle on the current value.               Figure      (For Reference) Institutional Leasing    An equipment procurement measure referred to as leasing is a  system devised by MITI in its attempts to rationalize and  modernize medium and small enterprises based on the  determination that it is very effective in terms of promoting  popularization and expanding use of specific equipment and  functions. The ``National Standard of Living Equipment Lease''  which covered ``voluntary-chain'' equipment and ``cold-chain''  equipment, etc., with financial debenture underwriting measures  in 1970 was the start of institutional leasing. Institutional  leasing subsequently developed into ``Leasing To Promote  Popularization of New Machinery and Equipment, etc.'' Relatively  low-interest financing for facilities and equipment for which  the promotion of popularization is desirable in terms of the  national economy is made available to lease companies using  capital derived from financial debenture underwriting measures  as the source of funding. As a result, lease users end up being  able to make use of designated equipment for a relatively  inexpensive lease fee. These institutional leases have continued  from 1972 up to the present as leases covered by financing from  the Japan Development Bank, a government-affiliated finance  institution.              Institutional Lease Arrangement Financed by Japan     Japan Development Bank Lease Financing System Coverage  (Equipment)    Items covered by institutional leasing: ``social welfare  equipment''; ``point of sales (POS) systems''; ``automatic gas  cut-off devices for liquid propane (LP) gas''; ``social welfare  equipment for the home''; and ``satellite broadcasting and  receiving systems.'' Financing for 35-40% of the cost of  an  item is received from the Japan Development Bank.    Japan Development Bank Financing is received in various  other  categories:     -  1. Aircraft    -  2. Aircraft Facilities and Equipment    -  3. Data Processing, Communications Enhancement    -  4. Import System Upgrade (equipment required to facilitate  imports)    -  5. Equipment To Improve Energy Usage (e.g., co-generation  systems, etc.)    -  6. Distribution Systemizing (machinery and equipment to  improve  distribution)    -  7. Regional Development Equipment    -  8. New Technology Development Equipment    -  9. Pollution-Prevention Equipment    -  10. Equipment To Facilitate Measures To Counter NOx       System To Promote Popularization of Co-generation Systems    (Enterprises Covered)    Enterprises installing co-generation systems (including  leasing firms as well), for which promotion of popularization is  recognized as particularly necessary in striving for efficient  use of energy.    (Equipment Covered)    Gas-turbine-type, gas-engine-type and diesel-engine-type  co-generation systems with primary energy utilization efficiency  of 60% or higher.    (Financing Ratio)     Forty percent of the item price (although there are  fluctuating factors, rate is 1% below the long-term prime  rate)              Finance Arrangement Diagram      (For Reference) Lease Subsidy System    Begun by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  in 1979 in order to increase consumption of domestic  agricultural and marine products, in this system part of the  lease fee is subsidized by the Food Industry Center, Inc. in  cases where food manufacturers introduce new machinery on a  lease basis. In other words, a ``lease subsidy system'' was  begun. Once a subsidy is determined the Food Industry Center  pays the leasing company a subsidy twice a year. Based on these  subsidy payments, the user deducts an equivalent amount from his  payments and then pays the leasing company. When the interest  equivalent on the cost of the item in the lease fee is  calculated in terms of annual interest, it is lowered  approximately 2% with the subsidy.    In FY1987, the Forestry Agency initiated a subsidy system.  This was done in an attempt to facilitate the introduction,  through leasing, of equipment to increase artificial drying of  lumber, mainly domestic lumber and wood products, to improve the  distribution of lumber. In this system the Japan Lumber  Stockpile Organization subsidizes a portion of the lease fee  when lumber drying equipment is introduced by leasing. Similar  to the Food Industry Center mentioned earlier, a subsidy is paid  to the leasing company and the user bears responsibility for the  remainder of the fee. In FY1990, coverage was expanded to apply  as well to computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided  manufacturing (CAM) equipment among the equipment to improve  lumber distribution.    In 1990 MITI's ANRE initiated a subsidy system. Under this  system a subsidy for part of the lease fee is received from the  Federation of Gasoline Retailers and Petroleum Associations in  cases where equipment relating to restructuring is introduced  through leasing. Unlike the two systems cited earlier, the  subsidy is paid to the user. Diagrams of the various subsidy  arrangements are given below:              Food Industry Subsidy         Lease Credit Insurance System    This is a national insurance system established in 1973 as a  system to supplement the credit access of medium and small  enterprises in order for them to use leasing on advantageous  terms. In substance, the item insured is stipulated and the  leasing company concludes an insurance contract with the  government covering the lease contract, and in the event of  default such as non-payment of the lease fees, etc., the  government provides compensation of approximately 50% of  the  amount of default. The contracting party in the current lease  credit insurance system is the Small Enterprise Credit Insurance  Corporation which took over on behalf of the government in  October of 1984 from the Machinery Insurance Division of MITI's  Machinery and Information Industries Bureau.    This system not only supplements the credit access for  medium  and small enterprises, the insurance money is paid promptly upon  contract of the insurance, is virtually as efficient as a  no-interest loan, and it also has the advantage of low insurance  rates, etc.    Leasing of Aircraft for Overseas Markets    As part of the measures to deal with Japan's favorable  balance of international payments in 1978 (the so-called surplus  reduction) under the leadership of MITI, the leasing companies  implemented emergency imports of aircraft and then leased them  to foreign airline companies. Under this arrangement the leasing  companies purchase aircraft and plants, etc. from abroad using  the emergency import foreign currency loan system of the  Import-Export Bank of Japan, and then provide them under lease  to various countries. It had the effect of succeeding in  reducing the surplus amidst growing criticism from a number of  countries, and of contributing to economic cooperation as well.    (4) Fixed-Rate-Interest Subsidies    The Japan Trucking Association, a trucking industry group,  also has implemented a fixed-rate-interest subsidy for  replacement purchases of vehicles which conform to the latest  regulations, and low-pollution vehicles will be covered by these  subsidies as well.    (5) Local Government Body Support Measures    Local government bodies will provide support to private  enterprises purchasing low-pollution vehicles.    (For Reference) Measure of the Environment Agency to promote  the introduction of electric vehicles: ``Pollution-Related  Health Damage Compensation and Prevention Foundation Subsidy''  (since FY1988)    (1) Foundation Details    The Pollution-Related Health Damage Compensation and  Prevention Foundation acts as a source of funds derived from  contributions made from the standpoint of social responsibility  by parties who are sources of atmospheric pollution, as well as  those who are connected with the sources of atmospheric  pollution, and provides prescribed-amount subsidies to local  public organizations engage in the following undertakings:    (i) local public organizations purchasing their own electric  vehicles    (ii) local public organizations providing subsidies to  private enterprises, etc. purchasing the electric vehicles    (2) Areas Covered (47 areas):    Chiba; 23 Wards of Tokyo; Yokohama; Kawasaki; Fuji; Nagoya;  Tokai; Yokkaichi; Mie Prefecture, Mie District, Kusunoki; Osaka;  Sakai; Toyonaka; Suita; Morinaga; Yao; Higashi Osaka, Kobe;  Kobe; Amagasaki; Nishinomiya; Ashiya; Kurashiki; Tamano; Bizen;  Kita Kyushu and Omuta.    (3) Principal Implementing Entities    The urban and rural prefectures and municipalities and towns  which oversee these areas    (4) Subsidy Amounts    (i) For cases in which a local governing body makes its own  purchase, the foundation subsidizes costs equivalent to one half  the purchase cost. Per-unit subsidies for FY1988 were:    (a) Electric Garbage Collection Vehicles, 10 million    (b) Light Electric Vans, 1.2 million    (ii) For cases in which a local governing body subsidizes  private enterprises, etc., the foundation subsidizes costs  equivalent to one fourth the purchase cost. Per-unit subsidies  for FY1988 were:    (a) Electric Garbage Collection Vehicles, 5 million    (b) Light Electric Vans, 600,000    (6) Indirect Assistance Measures    - Exempting low-pollution vehicles from traffic density  control measures implemented to combat atmospheric pollution    - Formulating measures to give priority to low-pollution  vehicles in public parking    - Establishing priority lanes for low-pollution vehicles  similar to priority lanes for buses    - Charging preferential toll-road fees for low-pollution  vehicles    (7) Others    - Promotional undertakings on popularization (directed at  businesses, regional residents)    - Improving abilities to appreciate industry RD trends  related to transport enterprises    - Providing facility-investment subsidies to

Later this week Nissan, the Japanese manufacturer, is expected to become another victim of falling European car sales, when it announces a significant cut in output at its plant in Sunderland, Tyne  Wear, for the last three months of the year. However, the company said last night that there would be 'no lay-offs and no redundancies'. Ford, the leading UK vehicle maker, has imposed a four-day week at its Transit van plant in Southampton, Hampshire, throughout September and October. Vauxhall is cutting all production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra in its Luton, Bedfordshire plant this week with the loss of nine shifts. It is cutting 14 shifts in Luton during September, which will eliminate the production of 5,506 cars. By the end of September it will have cut 74 shifts this year in the Luton plant. In the first eight months output at the plant fell 23.8 per cent to 84,630 cars from 111,116 a year ago. Vauxhall's plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, which produces the Vauxhall/Opel Astra, has virtually been working a three-day week during September with the elimination of 11 shifts, cutting production of 3,344 cars. In effect the plant has been closed for production from Thursday afternoon to Monday afternoon during September. A total of 21 shifts will have been cut in the first nine months of the year. In spite of a recovery in UK car sales Vauxhall output has fallen 12.7 per cent to 168,926 in the first eight months of the year from 193,542 in the same period last year.

They intend to capture a larger share of the European van market and attack, for the first time, Europe's rapidly-growing multi-passenger vehicle (MPV) sector. The new vehicle ranges have involved an investment of L1,234bn (Dollars 725m) at the Sevel vans joint venture plant, which first came on stream at Val di Sangro in Italy's Mezzogiorno 13 years ago, and FFr6.04bn in Sevel Nord, a new facility to build the MPV, near Valenciennes, which will employ 3,200 people. Sevel was set up in 1978 with Fiat holding a 50 per cent share and PSA 50 per cent through its Peugeot and Citroen subsidiaries. The projects have a combined production capacity of 320,000 units a year, of which 130,000 is for the MPV. The 190,000 annual capacity at the vans plant represents an increase to 800 units a day from the 550-a-day capacity limit for the old van models. The latest Sevel projects represent one of the most complex and extensive collaborative projects to be undertaken between two European vehicle makers. The van ranges alone were said at yesterday's launch to have 30 different body configurations, with three wheelbases and three vehicle heights. As with the original Sevel project, they will be marketed under Fiat, Peugeot and Citroen badges - as the Ducato, Boxer and Jumper respectively, except in the UK where the Citroen version will be known as the Relay. The MPV is to be sold under the Lancia as well as Fiat, Peugeot and Citroen badges, although names are not being revealed until the vehicles' launch in the spring. The new MPV is entering one of the few European vehicle market sectors to enjoy growth last year.   Companies:-  Fiat.     Peugeot Citroen.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.     ITZ  Italy, EC.

The deal is by far the biggest direct foreign investment in Romania since the end of communism in 1989. Total investment in the project, which aims to produce up to 200,000 cars a year by the end of the century, could rise to Dollars 900m, according to AC officials. AC, which was set up with Citroen in 1976, will contribute its assets and factory in Craiova, 250km west of Bucharest, to the new venture, Rodae Automobile Daewoo. Korea's third car manufacturer will pay Dollars 156m for its stake. It will raise much of this from the sale of 20,000 cars on the Romanian market, Romanian privatisation officials said. Additional financing will come from the South Korean Exim bank. Daewoo will initially assemble a version of its 1500cc Cielo model, a small family car, at the plant. From 1996, it also intends to produce a new small car presently under development. The investment is part of a Dollars 5bn Daewoo plan to quadruple its worldwide production capacity to 2m by the year 2000. The company plans to build two lines to produce transmissions and engines at the Craiova plant. Initially the Cielo would be 35 per cent integrated in Romania, but local content would rise to 80 per cent by 1999. Daewoo aimed to export more than half of its production to western Europe. Romania is one of six former east bloc countries with an association agreement with the European Union, giving it preferential trading rights with the EU ahead of full membership.

There was a good chance it would break even for the full year, it said. The German-based parent company, VW, returned a profit of DM35m in the review period, compared with a loss of DM917m last time, when the results were heavily burdened with restructuring costs and provisions. Total deliveries of VW group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda, rose 5.7 per cent in the first three months of this year. However, turnover increased only 2.6 per cent to DM20bn. Analysts, welcoming the results as better than expected, attributed the disparity between volume and turnover growth to sharp price cuts, especially in Europe. Group vehicle output rose 4.8 per cent to almost 760,000 units, including a 0.6 per cent rise in production of flagship VW models. Output at Seat, the crippled Spanish subsidiary, rose 44 per cent, while Skoda in the Czech Republic produced 4 per cent more cars. Audi, the quality car division, managed a 6 per cent rise. According to the company, group sales in Germany fell 1.3 per cent in the first quarter, when overall demand for cars rose 2.9 per cent. VW's market share was unchanged at a dominant 29.2 per cent. Meanwhile, BMW yesterday forecast improved 1994 profits and reported a 7.4 per cent rise in turnover, to DM13bn, for the first five months. Incoming orders had risen considerably, and would have a corresponding effect on earnings. However, the end result would be diluted by the costs of launching two new models, Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman, told the annual meeting. Setting up equipment for the compact 3-Series and the new 7-Series interfered with production in the first quarter, reducing output by 1.7 per cent.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

VW, under financial pressure with profits falling, is pulling out to avoid heavy investment in the project. SMH said VW was withdrawing because it had to cut costs. The Swiss company, maker of the popular Swatch watch, said it would continue with the project and was considering offers and alternative partners. VW joined forces two years ago with SMH to develop a small electric car for city use. It is continuing development work on its own city car project, called Chico, which may be powered by a hybrid petrol/electric power unit or by a small two-cylinder engine under development. General Motors, the US carmaker, said yesterday that sales of its Opel/Vauxhall cars in Europe reached a record 1.61m units last year, a 3.9 per cent rise from 1.55m in 1991. GM said its cars, which are sold under the Opel brand in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK, captured 12.0 per cent of west European new car sales in 1992 compared with 11.6 per cent a year earlier. Total GM group car sales in west Europe (including Saab, Lotus and imports from the US) rose to 1.69m last year, which pushed GM into second place in the west European new car sales league behind the Volkswagen group, which includes which Audi, Seat and Skoda. GM began production last year at two new assembly plants in eastern Germany and in Hungary. It opened an engine plant in Hungary, where it has taken over as market leader. It expects to be lifted in Europe with the launch this spring of a new generation small car to replace the Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     General Motors Corp.

Golden was appointed a vice-president of GM, the world's largest vehicle maker, in November last year. He will be the first GM vice-president to head Vauxhall for a decade. After many years of losses, Vauxhall turned the corner in the latter 1980s and last year achieved a record operating profit, despite the recession in the UK new vehicle market. Vauxhall has become one of GM's main profit centres, giving it an added status in a corporation that has been suffering record losses in North America. The UK has also been attracting GM investment and is becoming an important source for components purchasing for GM's operations in continental Europe. As GM treasurer in New York, Golden, 46, appears to have been on the fast track at GM. Of the five key executives at the top of GM today, four are graduates of the treasurer's office, including Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, based in Zurich. As executive vice-president responsible for all of GM's international operations, Hughes is now Golden's immediate boss. Golden began his General Motors career in 1970 in the treasurer's office where his responsibilities included overseas financial analysis. He later had various financial assignments there, at GM's headquarters in Detroit, as well as at the former GM assembly and Fisher body divisions, before returning to New York as assistant treasurer in 1984. With the Vauxhall appointment, Golden is being given his first operational experience overseas, usually a precursor to bigger things at GM.   Companies:-  Vauxhall Motors.

The announcement followed a crisis meeting of the Seat board, which agreed a Pta120bn (Dollars 941m) financial rescue package. The meeting was called to discuss the company's deteriorating financial position, which is likely to be a significant factor in ensuring that the Volkswagen group will report a loss for the full year. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the embattled chairman of the VW management board, had insisted earlier this year that the group would succeed in breaking even for the full year, despite suffering a DM1.6bn loss in the first six months. The VW supervisory board was forced to admit earlier this month, however, that the group's financial performance was being burdened by worsening problems at Seat as well as in North America and in the Asia-Pacific region. It forecast a profit for the full year only for the VW parent company. Volkswagen agreed a financial rescue package for Seat yesterday centred on its takeover of some of the main assets of the Spanish subsidiary. In deals worth around Pta120bn (Dollars 941m), Volkswagen is taking over directly Seat's plant at Pamplona in northern Spain, which manufactures the VW Polo small car range, as well as Seat's Spanish finance company, Fiseat. At the same time Seat management has been ordered to draw up an emergency plan for returning the company to profit 'by all necessary measures, including cuts in the workforce'. Seat said its financial performance had been hit by a series of factors, including the sharp devaluation of the peseta, a heavy debt burden and a steep decline in new car sales.

Mr Bjorn Larsson, president of Volvo Bus, said the takeover of Drogmoller, a maker of luxury tourist coaches with a turnover last year of DM56m (Dollars 36m) and a workforce of 250, was an important step in the Swedish group's effort to break into the German market, which is dominated by Mercedes-Benz and MAN, the domestic German commercial vehicle makers. The big European truck and bus makers are moving quickly to consolidate their hold on the small, and hitherto independent, bus and coach body builders in Europe, in order to guarantee the outlets for their chassis and drivelines (engines and gearboxes). The Volvo acquisition is the latest in a flurry of recent deals, most notably Mercedes-Benz's takeover of Kassbohrer, the German coach maker which markets its products under the Setra brandname. In recent days Scania, the Swedish truck and bus maker, has taken over DAB, a Danish body builder, while Volvo agreed the takeover of Aabenraa, another Danish bus body builder, from Kassbohrer, shortly before the German group was itself acquired by Mercedes-Benz. Separately Berkhof, the Dutch bus and coach maker has taken over its smaller, troubled Belgian rival Jonckheere. Volvo had tried for two years to break into the German coach market, using Berkhof bodies on its own chassis but with little success, said Mr Larsson. Drogmoller was the last independent German coach builder and offered the last acquisition opportunity. Volvo was aiming to increase its share of the German bus and coach market to more than 5 per cent in the next two to three years from less than 1 per cent at present, said Mr Larsson.

'Somewhere along the line we need to reach some form of compromise to take these trade talks forward,' Mr Smith said in Tokyo. His comments came as US and Japanese trade negotiators failed in talks this week to agree on how foreign access to Japan's vehicle and parts markets could be improved. The chief executive of the world's largest carmaker noted that the framework trade negotiations were important in helping foreign companies make progress in Japan but added that 'the strengthening of the yen against the dollar has done more to level the trade playing field between Japanese and US companies than all of the rhetoric and policy initiatives of the previous 20 years'. Mr Smith warned that 'the fact that the US-Japan trade imbalance has deteriorated despite the high-profile diplomatic talks. . . has not gone unnoticed by the Congress and the public'. Consequently, 'if Japan fails to open its markets more, then I believe the yen will continue to strengthen to the detriment of Japanese exporters'. GM had benefited significantly from the yen's sharp appreciation, Mr Smith indicated. The company has seen component sales to Japanese companies, for example, rise substantially over the past year and expects in four years to double its 1993 sales to Japanese companies of Dollars 800m (Pounds 512m). GM also saw a 27 per cent increase in sales of cars and trucks in Japan in the first six months of this year, to 17,400 units, of which about 8,000 units were made in North America.

The Korean carmaker said yesterday it had signed a deal with Karmann, the German automotive engineering and production group, to build its Sportage four-wheel-drive sports-utility vehicle at the Karmann plant in Osnabruck, north Germany. The agreement is a landmark deal in the development of the world car industry, and signals the Korean vehicle makers' determination to break into the developed markets of Europe and North America. The move comes a decade after the Japanese motor industry took its first steps into car assembly in Europe. Four Japanese vehicle makers now assemble cars in Europe; a fifth has a plant under development. The Korean motor industry has embarked on a rapid expansion overseas. Kia, the second-biggest Korean vehicle maker, recently began selling cars in the US for the first time under its own brand, after entering many European markets for the first time last year. Kia said yesterday that production of the Sportage, a compact sports/utility vehicle to compete against vehicles auch as the Suzuki Vitara, would begin in Osnabruck early next year. Initial output is planned to reach 15,000 a year, but Kia aims to double output to 30,000 a year for both four-door and two-door versions. In the first phase, the Sportage vehicles will be assembled from CKD (completely knocked down) kits shipped from Korea. But Kia said that, medium-term, it planned to involve 'as many German and European components suppliers as possible'. Longer-term, Kia planned to raise the number of components bought from German and European suppliers, with the aim of increasing the local European content of the vehicle to around 60 per cent.

0,FT942-2227 ,"FT942-2227 _AN-EFUD5AAMFT 940621   FT  21 JUN 94 / Solvent emission cut may hit output, warns Saab      By HUGH CARNEGY      STOCKHOLM   Saab Automobile, the Swedish car maker, warned yesterday it would cut production and slide back into losses if it was forced to meet demands that it sharply reduce solvent emissions from the paint shop at its manufacturing plant in the city of Trollhattan. Environmentalists are calling on the state body which sets industrial pollution limits to force Saab, jointly owned by General Motors of the US and Sweden's Saab-Scania, to adjust immediately to solvent emission levels of 550 tonnes a year officially set for its plant instead of the concessionary limit of 850 tonnes Saab currently operates within. 'If we cannot get a deferral we must reduce our production drastically to stay under the emission limit, which would lead to a loss this year,' Mr Peter Moller, Saab's development and production chief told a public hearing held by the Concessions Authority. The authority, which is also considering emission levels for Volvo, Saab's Swedish rival, said it would rule on the issue in August. Swedish companies face some of the toughest environmental regulations in Europe. The big forestry industry has been forced to spend heavily on reducing effluent emissions over the past decade. Saab is on target to make a profit this year for the first time in six years thanks in large part to the success of its new 900 model launched in 1993.

Deliveries of the bottom-of-the-range C-Class model had exceeded expectations by reaching almost 200,000 since the launch last summer, he said. Total turnover at Mercedes, which is the vehicles arm of the Daimler-Benz group, rose 28 per cent to DM16.1bn (Dollars 9.4bn) in the period, with passenger vehicles contributing DM9.5bn of this. Sales for the full year were likely to rise 7 per cent to exceed DM69bn, and the company was now confident of returning a positive result for 1994. Losses in 1993 totalled DM1.2bn, Mr Werner said. Saying that Mercedes' performance was running counter to the continuing down-trend in the rest of the car industry, Mr Werner said even the loss-making commercial vehicles business was gaining market share in some sectors. Car registrations in Germany had risen 41 per cent to 67,300 in the three months ended March, pushing up market share 2.2 points to 8.2 per cent. Full-year registrations were expected to top 200,000. Elsewhere in western Europe numbers rose 46 per cent to 45,000 vehicles. Japan and the US both showed increases of more than 30 per cent, he added. Mr Werner said factory capacity utilisation had been stepped up to 70 per cent from 65 per cent last year, and boasted that the gap between Mercedes' and Japanese manufacturers' productivity was closing rapidly. Meanwhile, the truck, van and bus business was still 'somewhat strained' by large numbers of relatively new vehicles taken off the road and mothballed by their owners during the recession. Foreign heavy truck operations, notably Freightliner in the US and Mercedes do Brasil, increased output 17 per cent to 26,500 units.   Companies:-  Mercedes-Benz.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

The Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said total sales were 5.33m, with sales of passenger cars, excluding mini-cars, down 8.6 per cent to 3.68m units, marking the first yearly fall since 1981. Eight of the country's 11 vehicle makers reported a downturn in sales last year, while sales of imported cars slipped 7.7 per cent to 184,616 units. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, said the government should consider new measures to stimulate the flagging economy if the slowdown continues into the spring. He said the government may need to remedy the stock market weakness, which has undermined business confidence. The Electronic Industries Association of Japan also highlighted the difficulties facing the country's leading manufacturers by announcing that domestic shipments of colour television sets fell 11.9 per cent in November, compared with the same month in 1991. Electronics makers were particularly surprised by a 24 per cent fall in shipments of large-size televisions, on which they had based hopes of a recovery in consumer demand for higher-priced products. Video cassette recorder shipments were down 19.9 per cent, while shipments of high-performance VCRs fell 40.5 per cent. Daihatsu, the maker of mini-vehicles and commercial vehicles, reported a 28.5 per cent fall in sales by volume, while Toyota saw a 5.4 per cent decline and Nissan 10.8 per cent. Mitsubishi Motors said its sales were 3 per cent higher, while Suzuki reported a 19 per cent increase. In December, passenger car sales fell 8.1 per cent on a year earlier, while truck sales were 8.4 per cent lower. Bus sales fell 30 per cent.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

The company said it was hopeful that its European operations would return to profit for the whole of the year after running up accumulated losses (excluding Jaguar) of Dollars 1.53bn in the past three years, including a loss of Dollars 407m in 1993. Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary, which has been in loss for the last five years, suffered a further net operating loss of Dollars 40m in the first quarter compared with a loss of Dollars 56m in the same period a year ago. The return to profit of Ford's mainstream European operations has been driven by higher productivity and cost-cutting. It has reduced the workforce of European operations, excluding Jaguar, by 15.4 per cent from 98,100 in November 1992 to 83,000 by the end of last year. Overall, west European new car sales fell by 15.4 per cent last year to 11.4m, and the company forecast only 'a slow recovery' in 1994 with car and truck sales rising by about 3 per cent. Wholesale vehicle sales from European plants in the first quarter at 428,102 were 1.8 per cent lower than a year ago. European market share (excluding Jaguar) has risen only marginally in the first quarter to 11.9 per cent from 11.8 per cent a year ago. Jaguar increased its sales worldwide by 12 per cent in the first quarter to 7,100 from 6,300 a year ago. Sales increased year-on-year by 25 per cent in the UK and by 18 per cent in the US, but these rises were offset by falls of 27 per cent in Germany and 21 per cent in Japan.

It is the first time that Mercedes-Benz will have fitted another manufacturer's engines in one of its mainstream passenger vehicles, and is an important sign of its new readiness to develop alliances with other vehicle producers. The deal marks the second significant collaboration this year between two of Europe's biggest vehicle makers. In April VW agreed to license technology from Mercedes-Benz for the development of a new range of light commercial vehicles. Mercedes-Benz said yesterday that it is to purchase VW's VR6 engines and automatic gearboxes for use in its planned range of multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), which are expected to be launched in early 1996. The new vehicle, to be named the Viano, will take Mercedes-Benz for the first time into one of the fastest growing segments of the European car market. The Viano will compete with established rivals such as the Renault Espace and new vehicles that are being launched by Peugeot, Fiat, Ford and VW itself. Mercedes-Benz said that engine and gearbox purchases from VW were expected to total around DM50m (Dollars 31.8m) a year. The Viano will be produced at the Mercedes-Benz plant at Vitoria, Spain, with a capacity of up to 25,000 units a year. Under the licensing deal announced earlier this year VW is to use Mercedes-Benz technology to develop a successor for its ageing LT range of heavy vans. Mercedes-Benz will also supply VW with components for the van, including steering gear, transmissions and axles worth around DM250m a year. Both deals represent part of the important consolidation taking place in the European vehicle industry, as makers seek to cut costs and reduce development times for new products.

Asking them to approve the sale at an extraordinary meeting to take place on March 15, Mr John Cahill, outgoing BAe chairman, counters criticism of what has been described as a 'betrayal' of Honda's 15-year partnership with Rover. For BAe to have gone along with Honda's proposals for restructuring would have required it to provide continued 'substantial' financial support for Rover while remaining as a large minority shareholder, Mr Cahill says in his letter. Honda wanted each to hold a stake of 47.5 per cent, with the remaining 5 per cent allocated to Rover's employees. Under the terms of the sale, BMW will buy the entire issued share capital of Rover and Rover USA, which controls Rover's sales activities in North America, for Pounds 800m cash. Of the sale price, Pounds 560m will be payable on completion of the deal, with the balance of Pounds 240m payable on June 30, plus interest from the initial completion date. In addition, BMW is assuming Rover Group borrowings of about Pounds 200m and responsibility for further off-balance sheet funding of some Pounds 700m. Although the sale will generate much-needed cash for BAe, it will also put the group in breach of its own borrowings limits unless shareholders approve further changes on March 15. Its articles of association currently restrict borrowings to a maximum of 150 per cent of adjusted capital and reserves. Since the sale will reduce shareholders' funds by nearly Pounds 500m, this limit will be breached once the sale is completed. Shareholders will be asked to raise the borrowing ceiling to 250 per cent.   Companies:-  British Aerospace.     Rover Group.     Bayerische Motoren Werke.     Honda Motor.

He warned that he would take 'tough and unpopular' decisions to return the company to profits after estimated losses this year of Pta100bn (Dollars 738m). Mr Llorens, 56, is the chairman the Spanish Automakers Federation. He was deputy chairman of Enasa, a state-owned truck producer that was sold to Fiat, as well as board member of Seat between 1982 and 1986, the date when VW acquired the car manufacturer from INI, Spain's state holding company. He replaces Mr Juan Antonio Alvarez who resigned as Seat's chairman at the end of September when VW rejected his plans to slim the Spanish company's labour force by 5,000 jobs. VW has drawn up a viability plan for its Spanish subsidiary which foresees the closure of Seat's 40-year-old plant in Barcelona's Zona Franca area and the switch of its production to a new manufacturing plant. Seat is planning to shed 9,000 jobs. Mr Llorens said that Seat will 'continue as a separate company and not just as a factory'. This pledge addressed fears in Spain that the German group would absorb Seat outright, close down its trade mark and its design centre and use the Spanish company's remaining labour force to merely assemble VW vehicles. VW is hoping that as many as 2,000 Seat employees that are due to be made redundant will be rehired by the Spanish company's suppliers. Unions have opposed any closure of the Zona Franca factory in Barcelona and have imposed an overtime ban in Martorell, the new production base opened this year, and at Pamplona, Seat's third plant. Half-day protest strikes against VW's viability plans took place last week and a 24-hour stoppage is planned for next week.   Companies:-  Sociedad Espano la de Automoviles de Turismo.

According to independent estimates, the company is heading for a loss of around DM2bn (Pounds 700m) this year and faces renewed challenges in 1994, when its key domestic market is expected to shrink by at least 5 per cent. Tomorrow's discussions will revolve around a draft agreement with unions, expected last night, to reduce labour costs by temporarily introducing a four-day week in VW's six German factories. But the group chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, is also expected to seek approval for cuts of around a third in his medium-term investment programme. He will also be closely questioned on the group's relatively poor showing in Europe this year and his plans for rebuilding its loss-making US and Japanese operations. The circumstances surrounding the Seat subsidiary's unexpected crash into losses of at least DM1.25bn this year will feature prominently in a report prepared by independent auditors, KPMG Deutsche Treuhand, on the orders of Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the watchdog supervisory board. The document, sent to board members yesterday, is believed to blame poor financial controls and reporting systems. Seat's losses, first discovered in late summer, followed the collapse of a new business plan, drawn up on Mr Piech's orders earlier in the year, and designed to generate a break-even result. Analysts suggest the group's 1993 results will be pushed further into the red by the costs of closing Seat's Zona Franca plant in Barcelona. The KPMG report also confirms that investigators have been unable to find any evidence that industrial secrets allegedly stolen from General Motors by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM director and now Mr Piech's top production executive, have been used by VW.

According to 30 pages of police crime and interview reports filed by  prosecutors in Santa Monica Superior Court, Smith, 26, admitted to homicide  detectives Wednesday that he killed 36-year-old Robbyn Panitch because he saw  her as the ""Antichrist"" and felt frustrated that she was unable to assist him.    The documents also revealed that Smith had threatened Panitch, and that the  social worker feared he was capable of ""assaultive behavior.""    Detective Shane Talbot, who interrogated Smith, said that Smith waived his  constitutional Miranda protections from self-incrimination during an interview  that lasted an hour and 45 minutes.    According to the police documents, Panitch wanted Smith committed for a 72-hour  observation period in a hospital psychiatric setting. But a court-appointed  psychiatrist who evaluated Smith earlier this month ""indicated that Smith was  not gravely disabled and did not warrant a 72-hour hold.""    A county mental health worker who came into contact with Smith over the last  two months told The Times on Thursday that, after a public outburst on a Santa  Monica street Jan. 3, Smith had been committed for such a 72-hour hold in the  psychiatric emergency room at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. When the holding  period ended, Smith was released, said the worker, who requested anonymity.    Calvin Kwan, an assistant administrator at Harbor-UCLA, declined to verify  whether Smith was treated at the center, citing regulations to protect patient  privacy.    Dr. J. Richard Elpers, a professor of psychiatry at the hospital, said that  ""the resident who saw the patient in the (emergency room) was very good. I'm  confident he did a good job. We did not make a mistake in this case.""    Elpers said that evaluations of disturbed patients can be difficult because  they ""become dangerous for brief periods of time in their lives"" and may not be  acting out their hostility during the period that they are under observation.    The county mental health worker who saw Smith before he was committed to  Harbor-UCLA on Jan. 3 said that Smith was in a jail cell, ""talking to a pen as  if it was an individual -- as if God's voice was emanating from it.""      'Gave Me the Willies'    Concluding that Smith ""was clearly psychotic,"" the mental health worker watched  as Smith was transported from the jail cell on a gurney, strapped by leather  restraints. ""I've been doing this a long time,"" the worker said. ""and this guy  gave me the willies.""    Panitch was stabbed 31 times Tuesday in her office at the Santa Monica West  Mental Health Service. Co-workers responding to her screams pulled Smith off  her and held him until police arrived, authorities said.    In the hours after Smith was arrested, he told detectives that he had killed  her with a folding knife he had purchased to protect himself ""on the streets,""  police said.    Smith told police he saw Panitch talking on the telephone and attacked her with  the knife, stabbing ""her multiple times.""    According to the interview reports, Smith believed that Panitch looked like a  childhood friend he believed was the Antichrist. Smith also was ""tired and  scared of living on the street"" and was ""extremely angry"" at Panitch for not  finding him shelter.    Smith told the detectives, according to the documents, that Panitch told him in  a counseling session a week before that ""Tuesday was going to be his day. Smith  took this to mean that Panitch was going to kill him on Tuesday, and in order  to save himself he must kill Panitch.""      Reservation at Jump Street    Mental health workers said they had difficulty placing Smith in residences.

FRY / Los Angeles Times      SMITH, DAVID SCOTT; MURDERS -- LOS ANGELES COUNTY; SOCIAL WORKERS; MENTAL  PATIENTS    "," LA022489-0068   22754    February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition      Metro; Part 2; Page 1; Column 5; Metro Desk      898 words      ACCUSED SLAYER CALLED OBSESSED BY SOCIAL WORKER      By PENELOPE McMILLAN and STEPHEN BRAUN, Times Staff Writers      As David Smith was charged formally Thursday with the slaying of his  psychiatric social worker, newly filed court documents detailed the suspect's  murderous obsession with his victim and the inability of the judicial and  mental health systems to prevent Smith's lethal outburst.    According to 30 pages of police crime and interview reports filed by  prosecutors in Santa Monica Superior Court, Smith, 26, admitted to homicide  detectives Wednesday that he killed 36-year-old Robbyn Panitch because he saw  her as the ""Antichrist"" and felt frustrated that she was unable to assist him.    The documents also revealed that Smith had threatened Panitch, and that the  social worker feared he was capable of ""assaultive behavior.""    Detective Shane Talbot, who interrogated Smith, said that Smith waived his  constitutional Miranda protections from self-incrimination during an interview  that lasted an hour and 45 minutes.    According to the police documents, Panitch wanted Smith committed for a 72-hour  observation period in a hospital psychiatric setting. But a court-appointed  psychiatrist who evaluated Smith earlier this month ""indicated that Smith was  not gravely disabled and did not warrant a 72-hour hold.""    A county mental health worker who came into contact with Smith over the last  two months told The Times on Thursday that, after a public outburst on a Santa  Monica street Jan. 3, Smith had been committed for such a 72-hour hold in the  psychiatric emergency room at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. When the holding  period ended, Smith was released, said the worker, who requested anonymity.    Calvin Kwan, an assistant administrator at Harbor-UCLA, declined to verify  whether Smith was treated at the center, citing regulations to protect patient  privacy.    Dr. J. Richard Elpers, a professor of psychiatry at the hospital, said that  ""the resident who saw the patient in the (emergency room) was very good. I'm  confident he did a good job. We did not make a mistake in this case.""    Elpers said that evaluations of disturbed patients can be difficult because  they ""become dangerous for brief periods of time in their lives"" and may not be  acting out their hostility during the period that they are under observation.    The county mental health worker who saw Smith before he was committed to  Harbor-UCLA on Jan. 3 said that Smith was in a jail cell, ""talking to a pen as  if it was an individual -- as if God's voice was emanating from it.""      'Gave Me the Willies'    Concluding that Smith ""was clearly psychotic,"" the mental health worker watched  as Smith was transported from the jail cell on a gurney, strapped by leather  restraints. ""I've been doing this a long time,"" the worker said. ""and this guy  gave me the willies.""    Panitch was stabbed 31 times Tuesday in her office at the Santa Monica West  Mental Health Service. Co-workers responding to her screams pulled Smith off  her and held him until police arrived, authorities said.    In the hours after Smith was arrested, he told detectives that he had killed  her with a folding knife he had purchased to protect himself ""on the streets,""  police said.    Smith told police he saw Panitch talking on the telephone and attacked her with  the knife, stabbing ""her multiple times.""    According to the interview reports, Smith believed that Panitch looked like a  childhood friend he believed was the Antichrist. Smith also was ""tired and  scared of living on the street"" and was ""extremely angry"" at Panitch for not  finding him shelter.    Smith told the detectives, according to the documents, that Panitch told him in  a counseling session a week before that ""Tuesday was going to be his day. Smith  took this to mean that Panitch was going to kill him on Tuesday, and in order  to save himself he must kill Panitch.""      Reservation at Jump Street    Mental health workers said they had difficulty placing Smith in residences.  Panitch had made a Jan. 27 reservation for Smith at Jump Street, a  county-funded facility for mentally ill homeless patients. Officials at the  residence said Smith never showed up for the two-week program.

0,FT942-4448 ,"FT942-4448 _AN-EFIC8AFXFT 940609   FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ford plans to develop new range of small car      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   Ford, the US carmaker, has approved the development of a new small car aimed at taking it into a segment of the European market below the supermini class in which it sells its smallest car, the Ford Fiesta. The company said yesterday that a decision on a production location had not been reached, but it is probable that the new car will be produced at Ford's plant in Valencia, Spain. Along with its rival volume carmakers, Ford has been intensively studying the potential of the so-called 'sub-B' segment of the European car market beneath the B-class superminis such as the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, the Ford Fiesta, the Renault Clio and the Nissan Micra. At present this segment is dominated by Fiat of Italy with its Fiat Cinquecento, produced in Poland for west European markets. Ford showed a concept study for a 'sub-B' car, called the Ka, at the Geneva motor show in March. Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said in an interview with Automotive News, the US motor industry magazine, that the new car range would be launched in the next two to three years. Other volume carmakers, such as General Motors (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) and Volkswagen, are expected to follow Ford into the emerging 'sub-B' segment of the market. Ford says its new small car must be capable of carrying four adults as well as some luggage. Volkswagen has also announced plans for a cheap small car to be sold for less than DM15,000 (Dollars 9,375) from 1996. It will be shorter than the new Polo supermini to be introduced later this year, but it will share many of the Polo's basic components. Ford's 'sub-B' car is expected to be derived from a shortened Fiesta chassis platform.   Companies:-  Ford Motor.     Volkswagen.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

He is understood to have telephoned Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, for a 'continuation' of face-to-face talks held in Berlin last Friday. Although the contents of last week's meetings were secret - the minister met Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, on Tuesday - Mr Rexrodt said at the weekend he was 'optimistic' he could tone down the war of words. He appears to have accepted the role of mediator despite his initial claims that that he wanted only to gather information. While there are clear dangers for a politician becoming involved in a potentially explosive legal issue, Mr Rexrodt is anxious that the inter-company conflict does not blow up into a clash between Washington and Bonn. The minister's 'optimism' suggests Mr Piech and his colleagues are prepared  -at a price - to apologise publicly for charges that Opel was acting as agent provocateur in a US-inspired 'war' against its domestic rival, and suggestions that it could have planted evidence with the aim of incriminating its employees. In return Mr Piech is expected to demand that Opel officials stop all press communications on their suspicions and also call a halt to the current criminal investigations against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the VW production director, and three of his associates. VW stopped commenting on the theft and industrial espionage probe more than a week ago, when it refused even to deny new media allegations that 11 of its employees transferred confidential Opel data in Volkswagen computers. General Motors officials have persistently refused to talk peacefully while VW failed to withdraw its charges, stressing that their legal complaints had made no mention of VW itself.

0," FR940725-0-00166   FR940725-0-00019        OSHA proposed in paragraph (a) that the employer ensure that employees understand all warning signs and limitations provided by Marine Chemists and the OSHA Form 74. OSHA has dropped the reference to the OSHA Form 74 since it is no longer required, and has added new language to clarify that the employer must present warning materials in a manner that can be understood by all of his or her employees. There are many methods such as dual language signs or pictorial graphics that an employer may use to ensure that employees can and do understand all warning signs and instruction addressing dangerous working conditions. This is consistent with the position OSHA has taken on other rulemakings that address signs, tags, and labels. For example, in 29 CFR 1910.145, OSHA permits the use of accident prevention tags using graphic or second language text where necessary. Moreover, the obligation to present signs and labels in a manner that can be perceived by all employees also means that the label or sign must be posted in a place where employees will see it in the course of their work. Other factors the employer must consider are size, material, and methods of attachment. In short, this new performance-oriented language requires that employers provide adequate notice to all employees of dangerous working conditions, but leaves the method of presentation up to the employer.     In paragraph (b) of the final rule, OSHA continues to allow employers to post the warning signs or labels at all means of access rather than requiring each tank or space to be labeled, as long as the entire space has been tested and certified. This is the same as paragraph (c) of the previous standard.         III. Statutory Considerations         A. Introduction        OSHA has described the hazards found in confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres in shipyard employment and the measures required to protect affected employees from those hazards in Section I,     Background,     and in Section II,     Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule,     earlier in this preamble. The Agency is providing the following discussion of the statutory mandate for OSHA rulemaking activity to explain the legal basis for its determination that the Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres standard, as promulgated, is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from significant risks of injury and death.     Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory     occupational safety and health standards     applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides that ``[e]ach employer shall comply with     occupational safety and health standards     promulgated under this Act'' (emphasis added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 652(8)) provides that ``the term `occupational safety and health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.''     In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective safety standards. In     International Union, UAW v. OSHA,     938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In     National Grain  Feed Ass'n v. OSHA,     866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective, directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion.     OSHA rulemakings involve a significant degree of Agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing courts must defer. (See for example,     Building  Constr. Trades Dep't, AFLCIO v. Brock,     838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988);     Industrial Union Dep't, AFLCIO v. American Petroleum Inst.,     448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the Agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought clarification of the Agency's view of the scope of its expertise and authority. In light of those decisions, the preamble to this safety standard states OSHA's views regarding the limits of its safety rulemaking authority and explains why the Agency is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided regulatory extremes and continue to do so in this rule.     Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) The proposed standard will substantially reduce a significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost-effective in that it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally, proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior Agency action, must be responsive to significant comment in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing a rule.

The heavy losses are expected to force Nissan to inject more equity capital later this year into the troubled Spanish group, in which it currently holds a 70.3 per cent stake. Nissan injected Pta5bn in July, but the company has indicated that it may have to put in a further Pta10bn in two tranches in order to bolster the Spanish group's balance sheet. Nissan Motor Iberica's sales volume fell by 7 per cent to 46,424 vehicles from 49,840 a year earlier, while group turnover declined by 8.2 per cent to Pta79.1bn (Pta86.3bn). The company's finances have come under acute pressure under the impact of the sharp fall in new vehicle sales in Spain and across Europe, which has coincided with heavy capital investments by the Japanese vehicle maker in Spain in new production capacity and in the development of new models. Nissan, which is in loss worldwide, is seeking to transform its Spanish operations from their traditional role as a maker of light and medium duty commercial vehicles chiefly for the domestic market into a producer of niche passenger vehicles - the Serena multi-purpose vehicle and the Terrano II/Ford Maverick four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicle - to be sold across Europe. The Terrano II was only launched in May, and overall Nissan Motor Iberica production fell in the first half of the year by 13.5 per cent to 36,007 from 41,607 in the same period a year ago. By the end of June the workforce had been cut to 7,005 from 7,228 a year earlier.   Companies:-  Nissan Motor Iberica.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

U.S. Customs Service inspectors ordered 292 vehicles to pull into an inspection  lot, where state law enforcement officers waited, said Customs spokeswoman  Bobbie Cassidy.    The drivers were singled out because their cars were emitting smoke or because  the driver didn't have proper identification or vehicle registration.    The California Highway Patrol and the state Department of Motor Vehicles issued  more than 160 citations during the crackdown, which was held from 6 a.m. to  noon, Cassidy said. Sixteen were for excessive exhaust only, and the rest were  for excessive exhaust and other vehicle violations, including expired  registration tags and failure to show proof of insurance.    Many cars entering the United States from Mexico do not meet U.S. emissions  standards and are major contributors to the growing air pollution problem in  San Ysidro, Cassidy said.

0,FT944-3870 ,"FT944-3870 _AN-ELLBEAFCFT 941210   FT  10 DEC 94 / Books: From Elvis to punk - Nostalgia rules as Peter Aspden tunes into the year's pop books      By PETER ASPDEN   As if sensing its own decline, pop music is delving more and more into the past to discover its true worth; and nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in its literature. The pick of these year's pop books fittingly tackle two of the genre's greatest legends: Elvis Presley and The Beatles. Peter Guralnick's Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley (Little, Brown Pounds 17.99) chronicles just a small part of his subject's life - up to his mother's death in 1958 - but how refreshing it is to see an author concentrating on Presley's formative, classic years rather than dwell morbidly on his decline. Guralnick's account is a welcome corrective to those who believe that Elvis was just a good-looking boy who was in the right place at the right time. He was also, notwithstanding his youth, an immensely dedicated and self-confident artist whose perfectionism exasperated colleagues; the rough spontaneity of a classic like 'Hound Dog', for example, required no fewer than 30 studio takes before the singer declared his satisfaction. The book also evokes marvellously the atmosphere of rural America in the 1950s. Ian MacDonald's Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties (Fourth Estate, Pounds 15) also makes the point that success and super-stardom were not achieved with the apparent effortlessness which the group's best songs managed to convey. His track-by-track analysis, unafraid of explaining seemingly trivial points with quite complex musical terminology, will prove irresistible to any fan; equally impressive, however, is the subtle, elegaic essay at the front of the book which is one of the most convincing cultural analyses of recent British musical history which you could ever hope to read. Elsewhere, we have had the usual mix of embarrassingly hagiographic biographies and serious, polytechnic-lecturer theses which attempt to locate the importance of popular music in society-at-large. These latter affairs, on the whole joyless and ponderously-written, are a result of the spectacular growth of subjects such as cultural studies in higher education, which legitimises doctoral dissertations on . . . well, just about anything really. One of the best of these books is George Lipsitz's Dangerous Crossroads: Popular Music, Postmodernism and the Poetics of Place (Verso, Pounds 18.95), a collection of essays which looks at the subject of ethnicity in music. The mix of different cultural soundtracks is one of the most characteristic features of today's music, and most of these pieces are intelligent and well-conceived. Which is more than can be said of most of the biographies on offer. Once more, the goodies are the oldies. Ray Coleman's Clapton: the Authorised Biography (Sidgwick  Jackson, Pounds 15.99), an easy enough read, perfectly reflects the man's current musical output: pleasant and unchallenging. The subject of Jeremy Reed's Waiting for the Man: A Biography of Lou Reed (Picador, Pounds 14.99) could never be accused of that, but he has become increasingly difficult to take seriously, scarcely deserving of the iconic status ascribed by the author (no relation). The most pretentious offering around is Ray Davies's X-Ray: The Unauthorised Autobiography (Viking, Pounds 16), in which a fictitious 'journalist' gets Davies to open up on his life in the 1960s, although there are some nuggets in the over-confused narrative. A more entertaining account of that decade's excesses is provided by Marianne Faithfull and her co-author David Dalton in Faithfull (Michael Joseph, Pounds 15.99), written with good humour and a certain amount of battered dignity. Moving into (slightly) more recent history, Carl Magnus Palm's Abba: The Complete Recording Sessions (Century, Pounds 12.95) is a good example of a pop act, notwithstanding phenomenal sales and even a cult retro following, being unable to withstand detailed critical attention. Palm has done his homework, however, and some of the early pictures are hilarious. A man who seems to keep up with the feelings and desires of each successive generation is Neil Young; The Rolling Stone Files (Sidgwick  Jackson, Pounds 15.99) is a revealing and poignant collection of articles from the magazine's archives, and a fascinating insight into the changing face of rock journalism over the past 25 years. But then again, time and pop music have a strange relationship. Delving into George Gimarc's Punk Diary 1970-1979: An Eyewitness Record of the Punk Decade (Vintage, Pounds 8.99), I was reminded that there were just four years between the release of the Beatles' final album, Let It Be, and the first Ramones gig. To listen to the two groups' music, you would put them 100 years apart; but things moved fast in those days. If nobody comes up with any bright ideas, expect both a punk and a Beatles revival for 1995, and expect them to be written about in yet more loving detail.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

They must be evaluated and fitted for the telescopes, get a  six-month learner's permit and pass special state-sponsored training as well as  the usual road test.    The telescopes cost from $500 to more than $2,000. They vary in size and  weight, but the most commonly used ones are about one inch in diameter and  weigh about 6 ounces.

Dr. Gerald Fonda, a Livingston, N. J., ophthalmologist who's been prescribing  bioptic glasses since 1947, said bioptic drivers need at least three seconds to  adjust their focus to the telescope, spot the detail and then readjust to  looking through their glasses. He said the telescope creates a blind spot that  is twice as wide as the field of vision through it.    ""The purpose of the telescope is to pass the driver's test. There's no evidence  this device is safe, and there is overwhelming evidence it is a hazard,"" Fonda  said.    Dr. Arthur H. Keeney, professor of ophthalmology at the University of  Louisville Medical School, said the telescope makes objects appear to be closer  than they are and that its ""awning effect"" obscures overhead signs.

VW's admission, it added, put paid to claims that Opel had been engaged in a campaign to defame the Wolfsburg concern and Germany by alleging industrial espionage by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's new production director. The potentially damaging admissions are believed to be contained in a written statement sent by Mr Lopez to public prosecutors investigating industrial espionage suspicions against him and three VW colleagues, also former GM employees. 'Based on the present status of the investigation, it is apparent that in a concerted action thousands of pages of highly sensitive data concerning cost structures, manufacturing and future planning were stolen,' Opel claimed. The US-owned company was responding to a statement published after a crisis meeting of the VW supervisory board in Wolfsburg on Friday, which restated its 'unaltered support' for Mr Lopez, former global purchasing director at GM. The 20 board members, who appoint and oversee the work of group executives, declared that a thorough examination of evidence from Mr Lopez had shown nothing to warrant charges of industrial espionage. However, the statement said possibly sensitive information had been destroyed by former GM employees, working for VW since March. The documents had been destroyed to avoid any danger of their circulating inside VW, it said. 'No possibly secret documents left the possession of former GM employees and came into the possession of VW.' Opel retorted yesterday that the information was technically and legally in VW hands. The attempt to suggest it was shredded in the interests of Opel was an untenable attempt to conceal the possession of a competitor's secrets, the company added.

The relaunch followed agreement in February between President Itamar Franco and Autolatina, the joint venture between Volkswagen and Ford which is Brazil's biggest vehicle maker. The president wanted lower-priced, 'popular' cars, while Autolatina saw the chance for a publicity coup and a way to extract tax concessions from the government. The car was launched at a ceremony yesterday in Autolatina's largest Brazilian factory in Sao Paulo. It was attended by the president, several ministers and Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's director of production. The Beetle's popularity in Brazil is partly sentimental. It was the first car to become affordable to the middle classes in the 1960s. It can also handle the country's battered roads and is easy to repair. The 'Fusca', as the Beetle is known in Brazil, has a newly-installed catalytic converter and electronic ignition. Otherwise it is almost identical to the old model which ceased production seven years ago. The relaunch has fired mixed emotions. Some businessmen have dismissed it as an unwelcome irrelevance when the Brazilian car industry is trying to upgrade. The industry, which includes Fiat and General Motors, is expected this year to regain from Mexico its position at the top of the Latin American league. Autolatina's unions are sceptical of the relaunch, even though it will create about 8,000 jobs. They claim Autolatina's total investment of Dollars 30m (Pounds 20m) is small and the car's estimated sale price of Dollars 7,200 puts it out of reach of most Brazilians. One union leader even grumbled that, given the money, he would rather buy a Gol, another of Volkswagen's Brazilian models.   Companies:-  Autolatina Brasil.

Talks this week involving Honda executives and teams led by Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, and Mr John Towers, chief executive of Rover, will help determine whether Honda will continue under BMW's majority ownership its 15-year partnership with Rover. Last night Honda, which has a 20 per cent stake in Rover, was giving no clues as to which way it might jump. Its agreements with Rover allow it to break formal ties as little as seven days after the passing of Rover into new ownership. However, analysts this weekend said such a move would be almost inconceivable given the commercial value to Honda of its collaboration with Rover. Honda receives some Pounds 400m annually in parts revenue alone, for example. The Japanese carmaker has made clear its anger at the intended deal, which it regards as a betrayal of the close working relationship which has developed between Honda and Rover. But this anger is directed solely at Rover's current owner, British Aerospace. Honda executives say that Rover itself has been powerless to prevent its own sale. BMW hopes to persuade Honda to stay in the partnership. However, Honda regards BMW as a rival, strongly wished for Rover to remain independent, and at the least is expected to extract a high commercial price for not pulling out. Should Honda be persuaded to form a long-term, tripartite collaboration, 'it would be a seminal event which could change the status of the motor industry for ever', and guarantee the futures of all three, according to Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School and adviser to the House of Commons select committee on trade and industry.

In a deal revealed yesterday, Honda has agreed to supply Mitsubishi Motor with drive shafts for use in front-wheel-drive Mitsubishi cars. Neither company would reveal the volume or value involved. The deal reflects a growing trend for Japanese carmakers to seek alliances with each other in a bid to reduce costs, make more efficient use of facilities and survive the downturn. Honda will benefit from the economies of scale provided by a big buyer for its drive shafts, which the company has not sold to its competitors in the past. Mitsubishi, for its part, will be able to reduce its development costs. Statistics yesterday showed that Japanese vehicle exports last month suffered the largest year-on-year fall on record. Automotive exports in October, including parts, were down 25 per cent in unit terms, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. In value, exports were down nearly 10 per cent. The largest falls came in exports to countries of the European Union, which were down 42 per cent in the ninth consecutive year-on-year decline. Exports to the US and Asia fell 21 per cent. In the domestic market, vehicle unit sales fell 9.5 per cent. Carmakers have been struggling to reduce costs and adjust production levels to meet lower demand. Mazda closed its factories yesterday for the second time this month to adjust inventories. Isuzu said it aimed to reduce its seasonal workers by 1,000, or 50 per cent, in a year. Earlier this year, Honda and Isuzu began providing each other with cars to supplement their ranges. Isuzu and Mazda also have an agreement to provide each other with engines.

The 11th-hour agreement, which is expected to be approved by the 20,000-member workforce tomorrow, is seen as breaking the back of the labour dispute that has disrupted South Korea's largest industrial group. Hyundai Motor is the biggest of the nine Hyundai companies now engaged in some form of industrial action. The government on Tuesday ordered that Hyundai Motor workers immediately suspend their action or face a confrontion with 10,000 riot police deployed to the car facility in the southeastern city of Ulsan. With the government's threat to use force, labour and management quickly reached a compromise settlement. The company trade union agreed to accept a 4.73 wage increase instead of the 16.5 pay rise it had been seeking. In return, the company increased fringe benefits, including special allowances, higher bonuses, and housing subsidies, and more holidays. Meanwhile, 1,000 police conducted a raid on the facilities of Hyundai Precision  Industry in Changwon to oust 400 workers who had barricaded themselves inside the plant for the past three days. The government said the raid was justified because the company is a defence contractor, whose employees are forbidden by law to strike. Although the new civilian government of Mr Kim Young-sam has promised to improve labour relations, it said its use of emergency powers to end the strike was necessary because the dispute threatened national economic recovery. The dispute has reduced GNP growth by 0.17 per cent and cut exports by 0.32 per cent for 1993, according to the Bank of Korea, the central bank. Hyundai estimates sales losses at Hyundai Motor, the country's leading motor vehicle maker, amount to Won390bn (Pounds 325m), followed by Won78bn at Hyundai Precision  Industry and Won69bn at Hyundai Heavy Industries, its shipbuilding unit.

The board of directors of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said the deal meant Japan's EC market share would rise to at least 12.5 per cent this year from 11.3 per cent last year. In a statement issued after discussion at a board meeting in Frankfurt, the association said this increase ran counter to a 1991 EC-Japan agreement limiting Japanese car exports to the EC for the rest of the decade. 'At a time when European automobile manufacturers are announcing massive workforce reductions, an increase in Japanese market share is unacceptable,' the statement said. The 1991 arrangement was based on the principle of fair sharing of market downturns as well as increases and both sides had undertaken to uphold the spirit and the letter of this understanding, the association said. The latest agreement, announced in Tokyo last weekend after talks between the European Commission and Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, would cut Japanese car sales in the EC by about 100,000 this year while the market would shrink by at least 2.4m. Japan agreed to lower the ceiling on its 1993 exports of cars and light commercial vehicles to the Community to 980,000, compared with an earlier limit of 1.089m set in April. The April accord was based on a forecast that EC demand would fall by 6.5 per cent in 1993; the new deal is based on a fall of 15.9 per cent. The motor industry association yesterday welcomed both sides' efforts to adjust their market forecasts, but called on them to implement a transition period under the 1991 accord to complete European restructuring smoothly.

0,FT942-13839 ,"FT942-13839 _AN-EDVCVAF8FT 940422   FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia sale may face hurdles   Volvo's plans to sell a 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia will end an involvement in the pharmaceutical industry which dates back to 1985. Pharmacia is one of the world's top 20 drugs companies with 1993 sales of SKr27bn (Dollars 3.4bn) - bigger than Astra, its main Swedish rival  - and it has strong market positions in areas such as growth hormones, eye surgery, and smoking cessation. It will not be an easy shareholding for Volvo to offload and it has made the government's task of selling a 46 per cent stake in Pharmacia this summer, Sweden's biggest privatisation, more complex. Volvo's stake will hang over the privatisation, even though it has a pact with the government which prevents it from selling all but a small portion of its holding before the end of next year. This means Volvo must sell in 1996 to comply with its own disposal timetable. At today's price, Volvo would get SKr7.7bn from selling the Pharmacia stake, against a SKr6.2bn book value. But the company will probably expect proceeds to be higher, providing the privatisation proceeds smoothly and pharmaceutical stocks come back into fashion. For the moment, the sector is overshadowed by worldwide pressure on healthcare spending. Much will depend on how Pharmacia performs over the next two years. The group will undergo restructuring following a period of rapid expansion and last year's Dollars 1.3bn purchase of Farmitalia Carlo Erba, the Italian pharmaceutical company. Pharmacia does not have the volume growth of Astra, and it will be relying on cost-cutting to lift profits.

VW acquired VAG United Kingdom, the distributor of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles in Britain, from Lonrho in December for Pounds 124m. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chairman of the Volkswagen group and chairman of the VW volume car division, outlined aggressive plans for the development of the two makes in the UK, which has been one of the German carmaker's weaker markets in Europe. He said that the VW brand would be aiming to gain a share of 7 per cent to 9 per cent by 1996-97, compared with a share last year of only 4.1 per cent. The Audi make would aim for 4 per cent to 5 per cent of UK new car sales compared with only 1.2 per cent in 1992. Volkswagen faces a predicted sharp fall in sales in Germany, its most important market, in the next two years and the UK is one of the few markets expected to grow this year, albeit from a very low level. Competition is set to intensify in the UK market as the three Japanese carmakers, Nissan, Toyota and Honda, build up production in Britain. Volkswagen's ambitions will pose a serious challenge to the established UK market leaders Ford, Vauxhall (General Motors) and Rover. Mr Goeudevert said: 'There is no reason why we should not reach in the UK the average level we have in the rest of Europe.' Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of west European new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent in the UK.

Another Dollars 23m (Pounds 15.2m) is being spent on a similar programme for vans and pick-up trucks. A fleet of 50 cars, adaptations of Ford's Crown Victoria model, are to undergo trials during a three-year evaluation programme in the US and Canada, during which several other utilities will also monitor the vehicles' operating costs, reliability and other data. Provided the cars are shown to have competitive operating costs and no reliability drawbacks, there is a potential market of many thousands of vehicles a year from the mid-1990s, as the federal Clean Air Act and individual state legislation clamp down on car exhaust emissions. Natural gas is potentially one of the cleanest 'alternative' fuels and it is claimed that initial tests of vehicles in the programme have shown emissions within California's requirement for ultra-low-emission cars, which starts in 1998. Under the Clean Air Act, federal and state governments are requiring fleets of 10 or more vehicles operating in the 22 most polluted US cities to begin phasing in very low emission cars, reaching 50 per cent of all fleet vehicles purchased by 1999. While there is already a sizeable market for converting cars to run on either petrol or natural gas, both in the US and Europe, the Ford vehicles will have engine and other components made to take full advantage of the fuel's emissions and energy characteristics. The Gas Research Institute and Southern California Gas are contributing Dollars 11.5m to the project, with SocCalGas providing the main fuelling infrastructure. It plans to open 51 refuelling stations by the end of this year, which will also cater to converted vehicles.   Companies:-  Ford Motor.     Gas Research Institute (US).

Daimler refused to comment yesterday ahead of the meeting of the company's supervisory board, but it is understood that Mr Schrempp, 49, chief executive of Deutsche Aerospace, Daimler's loss-making aerospace arm, will be appointed to succeed Mr Edzard Reuter from May next year. Mr Reuter, 66, architect of an ambitious strategy to expand Daimler into a global technology group, will step down before his contract runs out at the end of next year. He is expected to be appointed to the Daimler supervisory board although it has not been decided whether he should succeed Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, as chairman of that body. Mr Schrempp is seen in Germany as Mr Reuter's favoured candidate for the succession and is thought unlikely to break radically with the strategy established by his mentor. The other main contender was Mr Helmut Werner, 57, chief executive of Mercedes Benz, the luxury car company which accounted for 70 per cent of Daimler's DM97.7bn (Dollars 59.9bn) turnover last year and usually accounts for the bulk of the group's profits. The appointment of Mr Schrempp is due to take effect at the shareholder meeting in May next year, allowing Mr Reuter to take credit for the expected recovery in Daimler's profits this year. Last year the group made a loss of DM1.8bn. The Daimler supervisory board is likely to discuss the question of Mr Reuter's appointment to the chairmanship of that body in November this year. Should Mr Kopper step down from this position, it would be a break with the past as a representative of the Deutsche Bank has occupied the position since the 1920s.   Companies:-  Daimler-Benz.

Yesterday's announcement by the company that it was planning a small city car is part of a radical overhaul to its range foreseen during the 1990s. Other models to be developed include a 'people carrier' or multi-purpose vehicle and a four-wheel drive leisure/utility model. Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive-elect of the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, said Mercedes-Benz's current models had been 'over-engineered' and warned that future ranges could be 'priced out' of the market if such 'over-engineering' was allowed to continue through the 1990s. He heralded sharp price changes for future models, implicitly accepting they must compete more closely with Japanese-made luxury cars. Mercedes-Benz is also to be drastically reorganised with a reduction in management layers from six to four, a substantial cut in the 7,200-strong central staff in Stuttgart and the introduction of decentralised 'performance centres'. The company will accelerate plans to assemble passenger vehicles outside Germany and to search for partners in the development of components. Mr Werner said Mercedes would be transformed from a traditional maker of exclusive luxury cars into an 'exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high-quality vehicles in all segments of the market'. The company has plans for: A 'people carrier' or multi-purpose vehicle to rival products such as Renault's Espace and Chrysler's Voyager. It will be produced in Spain and launched in late 1994 or early 1995; A four-wheel drive vehicle to rival Land Rover's Range Rover and Discovery, Chrysler's Grand Cherokee and the Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero/Shogun; A small city car to be introduced during the second half of the 1990s.

The company reported net profits of Rp186bn (Dollars 88m) against Rp101.93bn a year ago, on sales of Rp6,282.32bn, against Rp4,110.47bn. 'The impressive result was due mainly to higher automotive sales, which accounted for about 75 per cent of total sales,' Mr Jos Parengkuan, an analyst with Lippo Securities said. 'But gross profit rose only 41 per cent due to a lower gross margin, which resulted from the strong Japanese yen.' He said average gross margins edged up to 18 per cent in the third quarter from 17.4 per cent in the first half. Meanwhile, the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper reported yesterday that Astra would secure a Dollars 200m loan from a syndicate of several Singapore-based Japanese banks. It said the loans would be used to finance Astra's expansion programme in agriculture and financial services. Mr Rini S. Soewandi, the company's finance director, was quoted as saying that agriculture currently contributes about 4 per cent of the company's total revenue. Mr Rini said that Astra had planned to raise Dollars 200m through bonds to be issued in the US with interest rates of between 9.5 per cent and 10 per cent. That plan was postponed as several Indonesian companies were reported to have issued Yankee bonds with higher interest rates. According to the company, the syndicated loan agreement is expected to be signed in Singapore on December 16.

He vigorously denied Labour charges that the passing of Britain's last volume carmaker into foreign ownership would mark the abandonment of the approach to industrial policy he advocated when bidding for the leadership of the Conservative party. While acknowledging that he was in the Far East on a trade mission when the agreement by Rover to sell to BMW was announced, Mr Heseltine insisted: 'We did not stand back from it.' He said Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, saw leading figures in BMW, as a result of which 'assurances were given'. Mr Heseltine emphasised that if the deal was agreed, Rover would maintain its separate base in Britain with independent manufacturing, design and development facilities. He told MPs: 'I am proud that it was one of my ministers who asked for these assurances and got them.' Mr Heseltine urged his Labour critics to recognise that, while manufacturing was important, it accounted for only 27 per cent of the wealth producing sector and 20 per cent of the whole economy. He attacked Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs for damaging Britain's exporting companies by 'innuendo and smear', and claimed that Labour's industrial strategy would lead to the re-imposition of controls over dividends. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, launched an attack on the government's failure to prevent the erosion of Britain's manufacturing base. He taunted Mr Heseltine with a reference in his book Where There's A Will to the importance of maintaining British control over Rover. Mr Cook said British companies distributed most of their profits in dividends because of the fear that a fall in share price would lead to a takeover bid.   Companies:-  Rover Group.

Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, the Briton brought in by GM last year to head Sweden's traditional rival to Volvo, declined to make a firm forecast, warning that the gloomy outlook in world car markets, especially in Europe, where sales have slumped 17 per cent this year, continued to cloud Saab's prospects. But, he added, 'I prefer to say that we have brought down the break-even point for the company to about 80,000 units sold per year and we intend to sell significantly more than that next year. So if nothing else changes we should be in the black next year.' Mr Butler-Wheelhouse acknowledged that the success of the new 900, which will compete against the Mercedes C class, the BMW 3-series and the Audi 80, was vital for Saab, which in the past four years has accumulated losses of more than SKr10bn (Dollars 1.25bn) and swallowed a further SKr8bn in two capital injections by GM and its Swedish co-owner, Saab-Scania. He insisted that Saab was not in a 'do or die' position. He said even if sales did not hit the high levels Saab hoped for, the company had the funds and the support of GM and Saab-Scania to continue to develop its next new model, an upgrade of the luxury 9000 car, due within five years. The chief worry for Saab is the steep decline in its main markets. It sold only 35,800 cars in first half of the year, compared with 86,800 in all of 1992 and 109,500 in 1989. Sales in the US - its biggest market - and Europe were down nearly 30 per cent.   Companies:-  SAAB Automobile.   Countries:-  SEZ  Sweden, West Europe.

At  least eight demonstrators were detained by Carabineros who went  to restore public order.    After participating in a tribute to the killed MIR [Movement  of the Revolutionary Left] members yesterday afternoon, a group  of masked people set up barricades on Grecia Avenue and threw  Molotov cocktails and stones. Carabineros cordoned off the area  and caused huge traffic jams. Vehicles were diverted to nearby  streets while Carabineros used water cannons and tear gas.    The new Israeli-made water cannons, exhibited at the FIDAE  [International Aerospace Fair] and purchased by Carabineros to  serve at the 29th Special Forces Precinct, were used for the  first time.    Carabineros yesterday evening prevented another tribute to  the killed MIR members in Villa Francia District, dispersing  those who were planning to participate in it.    Manuel Vergara, the father of the killed MIR members,  explained that it was a peaceful tribute and that Carabineros  ordered the dismantling of the stage. He said:    [Begin Vergara recording] It was supposed to have been a  very  beautiful tribute. We could have had a video with a script,  with artists. It was scheduled for 2000. The problem is that  Carabineros arrived at 1830, surrounded the area, and even  prevented the stage from being assembled.    Mounted Carabineros pushed the people. They charged at the  people and the stage had to be dismantled. [end recording]    While the mother of the Vergara brothers was expressing her  protest to journalists, a water cannon soaked the journalists  who were recording her comments.

The venture, with DCM-Toyota, received Indian government approval last week, and will begin production next year. The new company, to be renamed DCM-Daewoo, will be capitalised at Dollars 200m, with Daewoo holding a controlling 51 per cent stake. Daewoo will renovate the production lines at DCM-Toyota's plant in Noida City, which will assemble kits of Daewoo's LeMans Racer. Initial production will be 25,000 vehicles, but will increase to 50,000. Daewoo is focusing on the developing world to achieve rapid growth for its car division, although it is also planning to market cars in western Europe in 1995 and the US a year later. It is planning joint venture car assembly plants in the Philippines, Vietnam, Uzbekistan and Romania, all of which are expected to go into operation in 1995 or 1996. The strategy is part of Daewoo's plans to quadruple car output to 2.2m vehicles by 2000, with almost half the production to be located abroad. Several of the world's leading carmakers are seeking a foothold in the Indian auto industry. The US's General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle maker, is to start car production in India in a venture with Hindustan Motors. It is making an investment of around Dollars 100m. The GM venture will assemble the Opel Astra, its best-selling car in Europe, and will have capacity to produce about 20,000 cars a year on two shifts starting late next year. Production will be located at an existing Hindustan Motors facility at Halol, near Vadodara in the state of Gujarat. Mercedes-Benz of Germany, meanwhile, is to take 51 per cent in a joint venture with Tata Engineering and Locomotive (Telco). They plan to build up to 20,000 Mercedes-Benz E-Class executive cars a year.   Companies:-  Daewoo Motor.     DCM-Toyota.     DCM-Daewoo.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

0,FT933-15153 ,"FT933-15153 _AN-DGKANAAXFT 930710   FT  10 JUL 93 / Piech asserts his authority at VW      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   MR Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, yesterday publicly warned his former vice-chairman not to speak out of turn and reasserted his authority over his turbulent production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. He also warned Mr Louis Hughes, chairman of General Motors Europe, that he was doomed to lose his legal campaign against the German vehicle maker. Last week's abrupt resignation of his deputy, Mr Daniel Goeudevert, was mutually agreed, he said in an interview with Die Welt newspaper. Cuts at the top level, part of a DM8bn (Pounds 3.1bn) economy drive, would reduce management board costs by 30 per cent. An arrangement under which Mr Goeudevert, formerly in charge of the VW marque, was staying on as an 'adviser' was not an attempt to muzzle him, Mr Piech insisted. 'But should Mr Goeudevert speak publicly about internal matters, that would naturally have an inevitable influence on our further co-operation,' he said. Mr Piech quashed speculation - fuelled by Mr Lopez - that VW would shortly start production in a new super-lean plant in the Basque country. It was 'out of the question at this time. . . I have told Mr Lopez this,' he said. Addressing the legal investigations initiated by GM, Mr Lopez's former employer, into suspicions of industrial espionage, Mr Piech said it was 'exclusively a personal campaign' by the Zuricher. (Mr Hughes, former head of Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, is now based in Zurich.) Mr Hughes had applied for the top job at VW, he claimed. He was not 'wounded' when he did not get it, but the legal attacks came when he lost Mr Lopez to VW. 'General Motors is the last company where we could find anything of use to us,' he commented. Repeating that VW would break even this year after losses in the first quarter, Mr Piech said 90 per cent of planned restructuring had already been instituted.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

0,FT933-12291 ,"FT933-12291 _AN-DGYABAD9FT 930724   FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: For those yet to be converted . . . - Diesels      By STUART MARSHALL   SECOND-car buyers who do not consider a diesel are denying themselves the opportunity to cut fuel costs by at least 30 per cent and make a modest contribution to protecting the environment. More than 200,000 diesel cars were sold in Britain last year, most to company fleets. This year, sales have continued to climb steeply and a total of 250,000 registrations, or more than 20 per cent of the total car market, is on the cards. Every kind of car is now available with a diesel engine. Well, nearly every kind. No maker has yet marketed a diesel-powered convertible or sports car, although you could call Citroen's ZX Volcane turbo-diesel (a top speed of 118 mph/190 kph) a diesel GTi. And one really must think of BMW's fast and ultra-refined six-cylinder, 2.5-litre turbo-diesels, newly-arrived in Britain, as typical BMWs first and diesel cars second. Diesels save on running costs, not because the fuel they burn is significantly cheaper than unleaded petrol but because they use so much less of it. When running below full power - as car engines are for 99 per cent of the time - and especially when warming after cold starting, diesels can be spectacularly more economical than petrol engines. A typical family diesel hatchback - say, a VW Golf, Ford Escort or Peugeot 205 - used almost entirely on short runs of a mile or two may have half the fuel consumption of a petrol equivalent. Only when driven hard on motorways do diesels lose some of their economy benefits. Even then, they are still less thirsty than petrol cars. Economy over very large mileages once was the only reason for buying a diesel because they were less attractive than petrol cars to drive, had basic trim and cost more. None of these disadvantages applies now. Diesel cars burn fuel so efficiently that they cause less atmospheric pollution than petrol cars - less even than the latest ones with exhaust catalysers. A diesel car is noisier than a petrol model at start-up but, after a couple of minutes, it will be hard - in some cases, virtually impossible - to tell the difference. And turbo-charged diesels have similar acceleration to petrol cars; the Citroen ZX actually out-performs some petrol-engined rivals in the same price class. Trim and equipment levels are no different, and the hefty price premium once charged for a diesel has almost disappeared, not least because all petrol cars must now have fuel injection and a catalyser. The new Citroen Xantia 1.6i petrol and 1.9 diesel are both Pounds 10,895. The cheapest Vauxhall Cavalier is the entry level 1.7D Envoy at Pounds 10,360, which is Pounds 170 cheaper than the 1.6i petrol. Reliability is another good reason for buying a diesel as a second car. A diesel engine has no electric ignition, which removes at a stroke the main cause of roadside breakdowns. For starting from cold, a diesel has glow plugs. All you need do is leave the ignition key in the pre-start position while you fasten your seat belt, and then turn it to operate the starter. The engine fires instantly and runs untemperamentally while warming up. (For more than 15 years, my personal cars have been diesels. None has ever failed to start first time; none has ever let me down on the road. I cannot see myself ever buying a petrol-engined car again). Diesel car prices start at under Pounds 7,000. Among the cheapest are the Vauxhall Corsa Merit 1.5D, Rover Metro 1.4CD and Seat Ibiza 1.7D, all three-door hatchbacks. The Corsa's engine is a Japanese-made Isuzu while the Metro has the same PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) diesel used in the Citroen AX and Peugeot 106. Most Seats, although not the Ibiza, have Volkswagen engines. PSA is the leading European manufacturer of small diesels; its 1.9-litre engines power the Rover 200 and 400 diesels as well as the Citroen BX, ZX and Xantia and Peugeot 205, 309 and 405. Although, litre for litre of cylinder capacity, diesels do not develop as much power as petrol engines, they tend to pull very hard at low revolutions. In practical terms, this means that a diesel in fifth gear often will climb a hill that would call for fourth or even third gear in a petrol-engined car. And the need for fewer gear changes makes for relaxed driving. Is there no diesel down-side? Honesty compels me to admit that no diesel ticks over as quietly as a petrol engine, and some can sound rather gruff when accelerating hard. But there is no truth in the hoary old myth that diesel pumps are so filthy that, after tanking up, your next stop is the dry cleaner. At modern sites, the pumps are on same islands as those dispensing unleaded and premium petrols. Disposable plastic gloves are there for the taking. I never bother and rarely have to wipe my hands on a free paper towel. Another complaint was that diesel cars were smelly. Yes, they were - but not any more. Now, the really smelly ones are hard-driven petrol cars with catalysers which leave a strong aroma of rotting cabbage. The more you look at the case for buying a diesel second car, the more compelling it becomes. In the last Budget, all motor fuel duty went up 10 per cent. The chancellor said it would continue to rise annually by at least 3 per cent over inflation. As the running costs of a second car in most households cannot be set against tax, curbing its fuel consumption will become progressively more important. There is no better way of doing this than going for a diesel next time.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.     P5521 Used Car Dealers.

Faram, employing 30 people, specialises in breaking up and recycling cars. Not only western models, but the famous Trabant - affectionately known as 'the Trabi.' The bodywork, with its spluttering two-stroke engine, is made of plastic rather than steel. It was one of the symbols of the former German Democratic Republic. But like so many other products, it was in permanent short supply. People had to wait nearly a decade for one. By the time the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, there more 1.9m Trabi drivers on the roads. As soon as unification came, many east Germans swapped their Trabi for a western car. But not everyone did. Today, more than 920,000 Trabies still chug along the roads of east Germany - 'it's surprising how many of these cars still exist,' says Mr Mattauch, whose company is based in Rohr in the eastern state of Thuringia. 'I suppose it's because the old Trabi is still cheap.' But there's another reason: the Trabi has become a bit of a cult symbol in eastern Germany, and not least, part of the nostalgia for things east German. Mr Mattauch is already breaking up 3,000 cars a year, including 1,000 Trabies. He is delighted that the east Germans have not yet deposited their Trabies at waste recycling centres - 'I'll be in business for a long time - I hope.' But don't for a moment think that there is no life after death for a Trabi. Because it is not steel, it can be shredded, melted down, and then made into a form of plaster for the building industry - which shows it has qualities hitherto unknown to its critics.

0,FT944-8837 ,"FT944-8837 _AN-EKREFAA0FT 941118   FT  18 NOV 94 / Samsung accused of industrial espionage      By REUTER      SEOUL   Samsung Heavy Industries faced a storm of criticism yesterday after being accused of industrial espionage, allegations which may cost the company its entry into car-making, officials and analysts said, Reuter reports from Seoul. The state-owned Korea Heavy Industries and Construction said it had lodged an industrial espionage complaint against Samsung Heavy, the shipbuilding and heavy equipment arm of Samsung Group. A KHIC spokesman said his company lodged the complaint with local police in the southeastern city of Changwon after a KHIC worker detected four Samsung engineers taking pictures of production facilities. He said the photographs showed that Samsung wanted information about the production, setting up and operation of KHIC cranes. In its rebuttal, Samsung Heavy said the crane in question was old and there was nothing valuable to know about it. Analysts said the case could seriously damage the credibility Samsung has tried to build up in its efforts to win government approval for its plans to enter the car market. The company has for two years been trying to move into the highly competitive car market. 'Samsung has so far been unable to explain how its car business will be good for the national economy,' said an Economic Planning Board official. Seoul's trade ministry said Samsung's entry to the car market might cause overproduction, as three big carmakers were already vying for a share of the crowded market. The company faced severe criticism from established carmakers when it was accused of attempting a hostile takeover of Kia Motors in October 1993. Analysts said Samsung feared it was leaning too heavily on the service and light industrial sectors, compared with such rivals as the Hyundai Group and the Daewoo Group. They said manufacturing accounted for less than half of Samsung's sales last year, while making up more than 90 per cent of Hyundai's sales and more than 85 per cent of Daewoo's sales.

0,FT942-14916 ,"FT942-14916 _AN-EDRDZAEIFT 940418   FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (4): Cabriolets and the over 40s - Poll reveals quirks of the mature manager      By KENNETH GOODING   Now here's an interesting fact: the older the manager of a company car fleet, the more likely he or she is to restrict the choice of car available to employees. This emerged from a recent survey by Lex Vehicle Leasing when more than half the companies questioned said they would not allow employees to have 'exotic' vehicles such as four-wheel-drives, sports cars and cabriolets. Lex's explanation: 'This suggests that, as far as the fleet manager is concerned, a company car is a tool of the trade and to be used for the company's purpose. Therefore, non-standard cars may be considered inappropriate.' Older fleet managers, those over the age of 46, were the most likely to restrict choice of vehicles: 63 per cent of this age group offered no choice of exotics compared with 47 per cent of those under 35. 'This may be explained by the fact that older fleet managers are more likely to be found in larger companies where company policy is likely to be more tightly defined,' says Lex in its 1994 'Report on Motoring.' Perhaps the most important trend to be pinpointed by the survey was that, despite a reduction in Britain's white collar workforce, debates about the future of the company car and imminent changes in the system of company car taxation, there was no evidence that companies were phasing them out. Nor were employees pushing for cash in lieu of a company car. These findings are reinforced by research by PHH Vehicle Management Services which showed no sign of any decrease in company car popularity. Its survey revealed the most significant factor behind any increase or decrease in a company's fleet size was a corresponding change in the size of the workforce. Only 1 per cent of company car drivers questioned for the Lex survey reported that their company was phasing out company cars. More than half, 51 per cent, reported no change of any kind in their company's policy towards company cars. The most significant change in policy was that about one in every five drivers, 21 per cent, said that their employers had delayed renewal of company cars during the previous year. The survey showed that only 2 per cent of those questioned had had to give up their company car during the past two years. Of these, 65 per cent had become ineligible for a company car either because they had changed jobs or because they no longer had a job. Only 11 per cent of those who no longer had a company car claimed to have opted for cash or a salary increase within the same company instead of the use of a car. The Lex survey, research for which was carried out by MORI last October, showed most company car drivers seemed to think of their cars as 'tools of the trade'. No fewer than 69 per cent of those surveyed believed their vehicle to be essential for their job. This rose to 96 per cent among those who travelled more than 12,000 miles on business each year. In all, only 15 per cent of company car drivers thought of their car as a 'perk' and simply part of their remuneration package. Interestingly, over three-quarters of directors and partners considered their vehicle to be essential to carry out their jobs effectively, compared with fewer than half the senior managers questioned. Changes to the personal taxation on the benefit of having a company car, introduced in April this year, seemed to have had little impact on the opinions or actions of company car drivers, says the Lex survey. More than one in three of them, 36 per cent, had not or did not expect to react in any way to these changes. However, 24 per cent of those questioned said they had asked for, or were likely to ask for, a pay rise, because they assumed the new tax system would make them worse off. Only 14 per cent of drivers said they had asked for, or were likely to ask for, a cheaper car to compensate for the rising tax burden. Lex found that a high proportion, 38 per cent, did not know how much company car tax they paid. It suggests that this might be because the tax is usually wrapped into the driver's general tax code and paid via PAYE. Company car drivers, particularly those who clock up more than 20,000 miles a year, admitted to more motoring offences than private drivers. According to Lex, more than three-quarters (76 per cent) admitted to speeding on normal roads compared with 59 per cent of private drivers. Company car drivers were also more likely to park illegally, intentionally drive through a red light, not to 'belt up,' and to drive a car while over the legal alcohol limit. Paradoxically, despite this somewhat cavalier attitude towards motoring offences, many company car drivers felt strongly about safety features in cars. They appeared more interested in safety features than in security measures. The fitting of air bags, anti-skid breaking and side-impact protection bars featured highly in company car drivers' aspirations. Nevertheless, Lex found that company car drivers expected to have security features such as central locking, car alarms and deadlocks on their cars. In spite of recent reports about concern among women about their safety while travelling alone, only 28 per cent of companies said they took special measures to protect female company car drivers. Once again, the older the fleet manager, the greater was his or her concern. More than eight out of 10 (82 per cent) of the drivers questioned said they would replace their car if they no longer had a company vehicle. Of these, just under two-thirds (62 per cent) would replace their company car with a used vehicle and 31 per cent said they would buy a new one. Most (60 per cent) said they would buy a car of similar quality and type to the one provided by their companies.

0,FT941-3793 ,"FT941-3793 _AN-ECODSABSFT 940315   FT  15 MAR 94 / GM deal resolves fight over Isuzu      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   General Motors' Vauxhall subsidiary and IM (International Motors), the UK's largest private motor-imports group, have backed away from a legal fight over who is entitled to import and distribute four-wheel-drive vehicles produced by Isuzu of Japan, in which GM has a 37 per cent stake. A compromise has been reached under which both Vauxhall and IM will sell various versions of the vehicle in dispute, the Isuzu Trooper, until late 1996. By then IM should have available a full range of similar vehicles built by a rival manufacturer, Ssangyong of South Korea. Vauxhall dealers will start selling some Trooper models in May, but they will be re-badged as the Vauxhall Monterey. Under EU-Japanese market monitoring arrangements, it is expected that 6,700 Trooper/Monterey models will be available for sale in the UK this year, of which more than half will be sold by Vauxhall dealers under the compromise with IM. During 1995, when IM's current Isuzu dealers will have already begun selling Ssangyong's Mercedes-powered four-wheel-drive alternative, IM's share of Trooper sales will be halved to around 1,500 units. In the final year, IM's dealers are likely to be selling only 1,000 Isuzu models, mostly commercial-vehicle versions. Mr Bob Edmiston's IM, whose wholly owned Isuzu (UK) subsidiary has held the Isuzu franchise since 1987, last year declared its intention to seek legal action to block GM's Isuzu plans after Vauxhall's chairman, Mr Charles Golden, said Vauxhall would 'take up its right' to import Troopers from January 1. IM maintained that GM unlawfully sought to procure the termination of Isuzu (UK)'s contract to operate the franchise in the UK. IM originally filed a suit against GM in the US, but a US court ruled that any proceedings should be heard in the UK. GM has been selling the vehicle through its continental European dealer networks, where it is badged as an Opel, since early last year.   Companies:-  Vauxhall Motors.

0,FT923-7682 ,"FT923-7682 _AN-CHRBAAD5FT 920815   FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance  The Family: Pets at a premium      By PHILIP COGGAN   THE ROVER in the garage may be insured, but what about the one at your feet? Pet insurance is the latest product to be given a marketing push by the insurance industry. The main danger is not that Tiddles will be grabbed by a cat burglar. The two biggest costs that can hit a pet owner are veterinary fees and the liability to others if your pet damages property. Indeed, under the Dangerous Dogs Act, owners of certain types of dog are required to have insurance to cover the cost of damages, in case the animal attacks someone. But just because you have a loveable labrador does not mean you need to be without third party insurance. If your dog ran into the road and caused an accident, for example, you could be liable for the damages. Jardine Insurance cites a more unusual case of an owner forced to pay compensation after his dog fell through an office ceiling in the middle of a business presentation. According to Jardine, however, by far the most common claims are for vet fees. Everyday matters such as vaccinations or spaying / castration are not normally covered; the policies are designed to protect against illnesses or broken limbs caused in road accidents. These can be expensive. The Association of British Insurers says that treatment for a broken leg could cost up to Pounds 300 for a cat and Pounds 1,000 for a dog. And veterinary medicine has advanced so far these days that a cocker spaniel even had a pacemaker fitted - at a cost of Pounds 800. More mundane diseases such as skin complaints can also be expensive to treat. There are a number of plans on the market. Jardine (021-633-3377) has a policy called PAWS (Pet Animal Welfare Scheme) which is backed by the RSPCA. Kate Parminter of the RSPCA says the society is in favour of pet insurance because it is a sign of responsible animal ownership. The PAWS plan starts with basic cover for dogs at Pounds 49.75 a year and Pounds 32.50 for cats. Payments rise for those living in Surrey, west Sussex, London or Northern Ireland and there is a giant dog supplement of Pounds 6 for breeds such as great Danes. Jardine also offers a 'moggies and mongrels' policy for non-pedigree pets at Pounds 39.95 a year for dogs and Pounds 29.95 for cats. Petplan (0800-282009) has a basic plan at Pounds 49.95 for dogs with a Pounds 7.50 discount for cats. More cover can be acquired through the standard plan (Pounds 57.50 a year) or the supreme plan (Pounds 67.50). The amount of cover varies per plan but in addition to vet fees and third party liability, pet owners can also receive: death benefit (if a pedigree pet is killed); advertising costs if the pet goes missing; and emergency kennel costs. For those aged over 60, Age Concern Insurance (0883- 346964) has launched a special scheme. For an annual premium of Pounds 45 for cats and Pounds 54 for dogs, vet fees are covered up to a total of Pounds 1,250. (Policyholders must pay the first 10 per cent, with a minimum of Pounds 20.) In addition, the policy covers boarding kennel fees should you have to go into hospital, recovery costs if you lose your pet and third party liability of up to Pounds 2m. Age limits normally apply - the PAWS plan, for example, will offer new policies to dogs aged between eight weeks and eight years. Cover is not limited to dogs and cats. Horses, which can involve their owners in enormous expense, tend to have special policies of their own. What if you have an exotic pet, such as a snake or a spider? Cliverton Insurance (0263-860388) specialises in this field, providing cover for creatures that other insurers (and most people) do not want to touch. Philip Woodley of Cliverton says he has insured pets as bizarre as Cayman alligators and scorpions. But a lot of the company's business comes from exotic birds, which are popular with thieves. Cover can be expensive; preventing a Pounds 1,000 Norwegian blue from becoming an ex-parrot can cost as much as Pounds 127.50 a year.  The Financial Times   London Page V  "

0,FT934-12696 ,"FT934-12696 _AN-DJZDHAA0FT 931026   FT  26 OCT 93 / Germany and US to link up in VW probe      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   THE WAY has been cleared for US and German criminal authorities to exchange evidence gathered in their parallel investigations of alleged theft and industrial espionage by Volkswagen executives. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has been granted access to German public prosecutors' files and it is understood that FBI data may be made available to Ms Dorothea Holland, head of the German probe. The link is the first significant development in the case involving VW production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and several associates, all former General Motors employees, since Ms Holland led a raid on VW's headquarters in August. Mr Lopez and his colleagues are suspected of systematically collecting vast quantities of industrial data while employed at GM and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel. He has admitted having ordered the destruction of 'possibly sensitive' GM material at VW. The German authorities granted the FBI access to Ms Holland's findings after top-level negotiations between Washington and Bonn and the Hesse regional government. Mr Georg Nauth, for the Darmstadt prosecutors' office, confirmed the move yesterday. Ms Holland was still sifting data from 25 computers and 250 diskettes seized in the VW raid, in an 'enormously complex' exercise, Mr Nauth added. Asked if new evidence had been found, he replied: 'I don't want to say.' While the German investigation has slowed, the US probe has gained momentum with the summoning of a grand jury which will decide whether the evidence justifies indictment. The FBI has had access to all General Motors' material and affidavits involved in the case, and is also believed to have questioned officials from Volkswagen of America, VW's US subsidiary. Possible charges against Mr Lopez, his colleagues and the company include wire or mail fraud, which carry possible penalties of imprisonment or fines. US law prohibits the use of postal or telecommunications services for illegal purposes which include 'violations of obligations of loyal and fruitful service' to an employer.

0,FT941-8758 ,"FT941-8758 _AN-EBRCXABVFT 940218   FT  18 FEB 94 / Daewoo to set up design centre      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   Daewoo Motor, the South Korean vehicle maker, is setting up a design and engineering centre in the UK as part of its expansion into world car markets. It has taken over the facilities and staff of International Automotive Design in Worthing, West Sussex, where it plans to form the Daewoo Worthing Technical Centre. IAD, formerly a leading UK automotive design and engineering company, was taken over from the receiver last year by Mayflower, the specialist automotive engineering group. The move by Daewoo is a bold step by the smallest of the big three South Korean carmakers to create a global design and engineering presence to accelerate the development of its new-vehicle programme. The South Korean motor industry has embarked on a rapid expansion overseas and both Hyundai and Kia, Daewoo's bigger domestic rivals, have entered many European car markets. Hyundai cars were launched in the US in 1986 and Kia is entering the US market for the first time this year. The Daewoo Motor technical centre in the UK has a workforce of about 200 and is recruiting additional engineering specialists, product planners and designers. The technical centre plans to start work this year on a project to design and develop a range of medium-sized family cars. It aims to take on a new vehicle project each year. Daewoo Motor plans to establish itself as one of the top 10 carmakers in the world and is seeking to more than triple its world production capacity. It recently bought a 51 per cent stake in Oltcit, a Romanian vehicle maker, to provide it with its first production base in Europe. This follows the signing of several contracts for potential joint-venture projects in Uzbekistan, Iran, the Philippines and Vietnam. Its export drive follows the collapse in 1992 of its eight-year-old 50-50 partnership with General Motors, under which it supplied to GM in the US a Korean-built version of the Opel Kadett.

0,FT932-9054 ,"FT932-9054 _AN-DEPANAC0FT 930515   FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nissan Iberica losses deepen      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   LOSSES at Nissan Motor Iberica, the Japanese carmaker's Spanish subsidiary, rose sharply to Pta11.1bn (Dollars 89.7m) in the first three months of the year from Pta1.2bn in the corresponding period a year ago. Nissan Motor confirmed yesterday that it is to inject Pta5.02bn in new equity capital to strengthen the balance sheet of the majority-owned Spanish subsidiary. The new equity will raise Nissan's holding in Nissan Motor Iberica from 67.7 per cent to 70.3 per cent. Nissan Motor Iberica, which suffered a loss of Pta14.37bn in the whole of 1992, said turnover had fallen by 22 per cent in the quarter to Pta32.35bn. Sales volume, including domestic sales and exports, also fell by 22 per cent to 18,552 units. Nissan Iberica has been hit hard by the drastic fall in demand in Spain, where sales of commercial vehicles declined in the first quarter by 40 per cent and car sales by 37 per cent from a year earlier. As part of a series of restructuring measures aimed at reducing losses Nissan Iberica said that it was seeking: to cut costs in vehicle assembly by 15 per cent this year and by 10 per cent a year in both 1994 and 1995, to reduce overhead costs 'drastically', and to cut its indirect and salaried workforce by around 600 jobs or 15 per cent. The company's financial performance has also been burdened by heavy investments in the development of new products and in the modernisation of plant and equipment in the last two years totalling around Pta100bn. Nissan is seeking to transform the offshoot from its role as a maker of light and medium duty commercial vehicles chiefly for the domestic market, into a producer of niche passenger vehicles to be sold across Europe. Nissan Motor Iberica expects production to rise to around 90,000 this year and to 130,000 in 1995 from 77,000 in 1992.   Companies:-  Nissan Motor Iberica.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

ACTION:     Notice of receipt of petition for decision that nonconforming 1991 Toyota Land Cruiser multi-purpose passenger vehicles (MPVs) are eligible for importation.                 SUMMARY:     This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision that a 1991 Toyota Land Cruiser MPV that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.            DATES:     The closing date for comments on the petition is December 21, 1994.            ADDRESSES:     Comments should refer to the docket number and notice number, and be submitted to: Docket Section, Room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh St., SW, Washington, DC 20590.

0,FT931-5385 ,"FT931-5385 _AN-DCGAJAAIFT 930306   FT  06 MAR 93 / Companies cut back on recruitment      By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO      TOKYO   JAPANESE companies are scaling back recruitment in an attempt to cut costs and adjust to leaner times. Japan Air Lines yesterday said it would defer hiring 375 stewardesses for five months. Seibu Department Store, a leading retailer, plans to halve its recruiting next year from about 439 in fiscal 1993. Toyota, the leading car maker, has for the first time in five years stopped hiring full- time production workers outside the usual recruiting period. There is growing public and government concern about the cancellations and their effect on society. The Ministry of Labour said this week it would propose amending part of the Employment Security Law to require companies planning to cancel promised employment to graduates to notify public job security agencies and school authorities. The companies themselves would be publicly identified. Fourteen companies have so far cancelled the hiring of 211 graduates who had been told that they would be hired from April. Japanese law has no provision for punishing violators of the gentleman's agreement known as naitei, by which graduates are promised employment at companies and are themselves more or less committed to that promise. The ministry hopes to introduce its new measure by the end of the month after receiving a report from its advisory council. Japanese companies are reluctant to make employees redundant, as such moves are frowned upon by society, and cancelling recruitment plans is one of the few options available to them to cut employment costs. However, the government has become concerned about the social impact of such moves, and the ministry has publicly asked corporations not to cut their workforces drastically in an attempt to cut costs. JAL said that it had decided to postpone hiring the stewardesses because the number of flights it will have during the period will be less than planned as a result its restructuring programme. By September, the airline says, it should be able to hire new recruits as other stewardesses retire.   Companies:-  Japan Airlines.     Seibu Department Stores.     Toyota Motor Corp.

GM Poland, which is 70 per cent owned by GM and 30 per cent by FSO, is aiming initially to assemble 10,000 cars a year at the Warsaw plant with a workforce of 125 following an investment of around DM30m (Dollars 20m) The FSO plant is also one of several locations in Europe under investigation by GM for a much more ambitious investment in the production of a new range of small cars. GM Poland will produce initially the Opel/Vauxhall Astra small family saloon car in an SKD (semi-knocked-down) kit assembly operation. Painted bodies will be delivered to Warsaw by train from the Opel plant at Antwerp, Belgium, along with engines, transmissions and other components from the group's plant at Bochum, Germany. The Astra, GM's best-selling car worldwide, with sales of 700,000 forecast for 1994, is currently assembled at plants in the UK, Belgium and Germany and at smaller facilities in Hungary, Turkey and Taiwan. Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, said at the weekend at the opening of the Warsaw plant that GM was also planning to begin Astra production in Brazil, Indonesia, India and Thailand. The assembly operation in Warsaw is GM's third investment in vehicle production in east Europe following the building of a car plant at Eisenach in eastern Germany, and an engine and small volume car plant at Szentgotthard in Hungary. Mr Smith said that 'Poland is and will remain a potential for future Opel car and component production.' GM is also committed to examining the prospects for producing a replacement vehicle for FSO's outdated Polonez saloon car in Warsaw. The Warsaw workforce can be increased to 250 for two-shift working and GM said that the operation had the flexibility to raise output to 33,000 a year with additional investment and employment.

0,FT931-7215 ,"FT931-7215 _AN-DBYB6AESFT 930225   FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: VW set for management changes      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   SWEEPING changes in the top management of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, are expected to be approved at a meeting of the company's supervisory board next month. Speculation about the outcome of the March 16 sitting revived yesterday when officials of the Lower Saxony government claimed that Mr Ferdinand Piech, the new VW chairman, had enticed Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriotua to quit his job at General Motors of the US. Mr Lopez moved within GM from Europe to Detroit last year, taking with him a reputation as a hard-bargaining cost-cutter. He was recently promoted to vice-president and group executive in charge of worldwide purchasing. GM denied the reports. 'He is not leaving. He is happy here and is staying here', the company said. However, Mr Piech has already had marked success in poaching key GM managers. Before he left his former job as head of Audi, he brought in Mr Jurgen Gebhardt, former manager of Opel's car plant in Eisenach, as director responsible for production at the upmarket VW subsidiary. Mr Erich Schmitt, another GM manager, was given a boardroom seat and responsibility for purchasing and finance. Yesterday's reports that Mr Lopez was to join VW were given extra credibility by their origins. The Lower Saxony government, with 20 per cent of the shares, is VW's largest stockholder and is represented with several seats on the supervisory board. Other changes expected at the board meeting include the replacement of Mr Dieter Ullsperger, finance director, and directors responsible for legal affairs and the environment. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy to Mr Piech and responsible for the Volkswagen brand, is expected to be given other day-to-day responsibilities. Deteriorating conditions in VW's markets were underlined yesterday by the announcement that group sales worldwide fell more than 16 per cent in January.

Japan Air Lines yesterday said it would defer hiring 375 stewardesses for five months. Seibu Department Store, a leading retailer, plans to halve its recruiting next year from about 439 in fiscal 1993. Toyota, the leading car maker, has for the first time in five years stopped hiring full- time production workers outside the usual recruiting period. There is growing public and government concern about the cancellations and their effect on society. The Ministry of Labour said this week it would propose amending part of the Employment Security Law to require companies planning to cancel promised employment to graduates to notify public job security agencies and school authorities. The companies themselves would be publicly identified. Fourteen companies have so far cancelled the hiring of 211 graduates who had been told that they would be hired from April. Japanese law has no provision for punishing violators of the gentleman's agreement known as naitei, by which graduates are promised employment at companies and are themselves more or less committed to that promise. The ministry hopes to introduce its new measure by the end of the month after receiving a report from its advisory council. Japanese companies are reluctant to make employees redundant, as such moves are frowned upon by society, and cancelling recruitment plans is one of the few options available to them to cut employment costs. However, the government has become concerned about the social impact of such moves, and the ministry has publicly asked corporations not to cut their workforces drastically in an attempt to cut costs. JAL said that it had decided to postpone hiring the stewardesses because the number of flights it will have during the period will be less than planned as a result its restructuring programme. By September, the airline says, it should be able to hire new recruits as other stewardesses retire.   Companies:-  Japan Air Lines.     Seibu Department Stores.     Toyota Motor Corp.

The company, in the throes of a restructuring to return loss-making North American operations to profit, said in the 1994 model year, starting in October, it would expand the 'value pricing' marketing idea it initiated on some models in 1993. This involved dropping the price of certain models of vehicles, equipped with popular levels of optional equipment. The idea is to lift sales and run GM's factories closer to capacity, to raise profits. Mr Michael Losh, a GM vice-president, said a value pricing strategy had been a factor behind the resurgence of GM's North American sales this year. The company's share of the US passenger car market fell sharply late last calendar year, to less than 31 per cent, when it cut back sharply on unprofitable sales to fleet buyers. However, it has recovered this year and in June totalled 37.1 per cent, compared with 36.7 per cent a year earlier. However, in the first half of 1993 its car market share was down a point on 1992, at 35.3 per cent. The recovery has been due partly to value pricing and because Japanese competitors, hurt by a strong yen, have been increasing their prices faster than American rivals. Mr Losh said that in the 1994 model year, GM's prices would rise by 1.5 per cent, even though they were fitted with additional equipment. Truck prices would rise by 2.2 per cent and the average price for GM vehicles would go up about 1.8 per cent - about half the rate of inflation. However, the proposed price changes do not include the impact of rebates to consumers given by US car companies to increase sales. Mr Losh said he expected 1994 rebates to be below those of 1993, but the company would alter policy in response to competitors.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.

In their handling of the Der Spiegel affair they simply broke the most elementary rules of corporate public relations behaviour. First, they disregarded the basic rule, especially in the automotive industry, never to react in this way to articles in the press. Then they topped it off by asking the courts to order rebuttals to be printed and, even worse, pressed for a gag order. Mr Piech almost unbelievably failed to foresee Der Spiegel's very predictable reaction. It asked and obtained from the court a suspension of the ban and, by doing so, allowed the magazine to present sufficient evidence to prove the substance of their allegations before the courts. For Opel it was an unexpected opportunity that allowed it to submit its case practically on its own terms. It eagerly offered Der Spiegel the assistance of 22 GM and Opel witnesses and four legal experts. All volunteers, as they claim. Although Der Spiegel has a solid reputation for investigative reporting, it is difficult to believe that it did not get any help from Opel when researching the story. It therefore looks very much as if Piech, with both eyes wide open, fell into a trap set by Opel. 'I was badly advised,' Piech later ruefully remarked. An example of very poor managerial judgment from a man who claims to be the only one qualified to save the embattled company. And with the help of a man who increasingly seems to be responsible for this 'fine mess he got Volkswagen in to'.

Vauxhall is planning to increase capacity at the plant, which produces the Vauxhall Cavalier-Opel Vectra large family car, by about 25 per cent by the end of 1995, when the present car is replaced. The company has emerged as the most profitable carmaker in the UK during the recession, and the Luton plant is now GM's lowest-cost assembly facility in Europe for the Cavalier-Vectra, ahead of rival plants in Belgium and Germany. In preparation for the introduction of the Cavalier-Vectra replacement in two years, GM is planning a marked increase in the level of automation at the Luton plant. It is investing heavily in new equipment for body welding, and the number of robots at the plant will be increased from the present 34 to about 215. The amount of automated spot welding will rise from 20 per cent to 70 per cent of the total. GM is also installing a new trim and final assembly line. The investment in new plant and equipment, coupled with the improved design of the new car, is aimed at reducing the time needed to make each car by more than a third to about 17 hours a car by 1998. Vauxhall is aiming to increase the plant capacity from about 48 to 60 cars an hour or some 215,000 cars a year by the end of 1995, when it begins production of the new model. In 1992, Luton produced a record 170,600 cars. But production has fallen by nearly 30 per cent this year, to about 121,000, as exports have plunged in the face of the steep decline in demand in continental Europe. Exports in 1993 have accounted for only 14.7 per cent of the plant's output, compared with 41 per cent last year.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Vauxhall Motors.

In a letter to shareholders, Volkswagen indicated that it would start making profits again in the second half of the year and would be able to report a positive result for the year as a whole. These confident comments reiterated the message given by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's chief executive, at the group's press conference at the end of March. It was then that he revealed the scale of the first-quarter loss - but said that the worst was over. The comments support investors' confidence that VW's aggressive cost-cutting measures would bear fruit later this year, possibly allowing the company to pay a dividend after the pay-out for 1992 was cut to DM2 from DM11 in 1991. VW's shares added DM4.50 yesterday to close at DM322. The company is planning to shed 20,000 jobs this year out of a total of 36,000 job cuts to take effect by the end of 1997. The company's commitment to tackling its bloated cost base was underscored by the hiring of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez, the Spanish purchasing chief who left General Motors to join Volkswagen at the end of March. BMW yesterday announced that sales for the first four months of the year had dropped by 8.3 per cent to DM9.67bn. Production of cars fell by 11.5 per cent to 189,528 units, showing that the company was not immune to the downturn in the German car sector. However, the Bavaria-based company continued to escape the worst of the problems: in Germany the number of new passenger vehicle registrations in the first quarter of the year fell 21.5 per cent. Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, speaking at his last shareholders' meeting as chief executive, said that BMW would deliver a healthy profit for the full year.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

0,FT931-16040 ,"FT931-16040 _AN-DAJAPAAVFT 930109   FT  09 JAN 93 / Japan freezes car export quota for US      By ROBERT THOMSON      TOKYO   THE Japanese government has decided not to alter the country's voluntary car export quota for the US from last year's level of 1.65m units, claiming that the freeze will 'assist the rehabilitation' of US car makers. Japan had reduced the quota from 2.3m units in 1991, but the US car industry demanded further cuts, arguing that the figure had become meaningless as it did not take into account the US production capacity of Japanese makers. Mr Yoshiro Mori, the minister of international trade and industry, said the freeze would assist one struggling US car maker in particular. Mr Mori did not name the company, but was apparently referring to General Motors, the largest US maker. Voluntary restraint began in 1981, under pressure from the US government, when the quota was set at 1.68m units. It was lifted to 2.3m units from 1985, where it remained until the revision in March,last year. Japan's quota announcement coincided with the release of a US Commerce Department forecast that the US is likely to see a 9.5 per cent increase to Dollars 21.9bn in the deficit this year in car and car parts trade with Japan. The Japanese government argues that US makers are likely to benefit from an increase in consumer demand this year, and the restraint on exports will limit the ability of Japanese to profit from the recovery. 'The US automobile industry now looks like it is recovering but there is still uncertainty over its outlook,' Mr Mori said. Meanwhile, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association said imported vehicle sales fell 7.7 per cent last year to 184,615 units, the second consecutive year of decline. Total sales in the Japanese market fell 7.2 per cent to 5.3m units. Sales of US-made cars rose 23.1 per cent, but the largest increase was in imports of Japanese makers' vehicles. Ford Motor sales rose 15 per cent and Chrysler reported sales 7.4 per cent higher, though GM had a 1.9 per cent decline in sales.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.     USZ  USA.

0,FT932-9215 ,"FT932-9215 _AN-DENCNAFTFT 930514   FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nissan agrees deal to buy parts from Toyota supplier      By CHARLES LEADBEATER      TOKYO.   NISSAN, Japan's second largest carmaker yesterday took the unprecedented step of agreeing to buy parts from a supplier affiliated to Toyota, its arch rival and Japan's largest car manufacturer. The deal is the clearest challenge yet to the traditional structure of the Japanese car industry, in which car manufacturers are supported by a vast hinterland of suppliers dedicated to that car maker. By taking this move, Nissan and Toyota are signalling to other makers and suppliers that they are not opposed to cost cutting measures which involve companies from different corporate groupings. The agreement marks a departure for Japan's car makers which are restructuring to cut costs in response to deeply depressed domestic sales, stagnant export markets and heavy fixed costs from past investment. The agreement is for Nissan to purchase about Y1bn (Dollars 9m) worth of engine parts a year from Aisan Industry, an affiliated supplier in which Toyota has a large minority shareholding. The deal is small and does not come into operation until 1995 but it could well pave the way for other car manufacturers to break the strict demarcation lines between suppliers for different car makers. Nissan will buy vacuum pumps from Aisan Industry. The parts which are used in diesel engines for Toyota's Camry and Corona models will be used, without modification, in two of Nissan's six types of diesel engine. Nissan executives indicated that Aisan's vacuum pumps were more reliable than the pumps it uses. Some car industry executives predicted that the deal would pave the way for Nissan and Toyota to cut costs by jointly designing and procuring common engine parts, including commercial vans and trucks as well as cars. Japanese car manufacturers are planning to cut the number of components they use by up to 40 per cent in an attempt to cut costs. It is likely that this will lead to a sharp reductions in the number of suppliers affiliated to car manufacturers.   Companies:-  Nissan Motor Corp.     Toyota Motor Corp.     Aisan Industry.

The new engines, which will also feature the introduction of a 1.6 litre version of its successful 1.1 litre and 1.4 litre K Series engines, will allow Rover to reduce significantly its dependence on Honda, the Japanese carmaker. Rover is developing the V6 engine from its present K Series family of power units and is expected to launch the new engine in its 800 series executive car range in 1995. It would replace the present 2.7 litre V6 Honda engine, which the Japanese carmaker now makes only for Rover, and would represent a considerable cost-saving for Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace. The K Series engine, launched in 1989, is now made in four-cylinder 1.1 litre and 1.4 litre versions to power the Rover Metro and some versions of the Rover 200/400 series cars, while the UK carmaker also buys a more powerful 1.6 litre engine from Honda for the Rover 200/400. The new 1.6 litre engine for the K Series will be introduced next year in the Rover 200 to replace the Honda power unit produced at the Japanese carmaker's plant in Swindon. Rover's engine production is based at its Longbridge, Birmingham plant. At present Rover buys all of its 2.0 litre and 2.3 litre engines for the Rover 600 from Honda. The Japanese carmaker holds a 20 per cent equity stake in Rover vehicle operations, and the Rover 200/400, 600 and 800 series are based on Honda technology. Rover has entered discussions with Kia Motors, the South Korean carmaker, which is considering producing a version of the Rover V6 engine in Korea to power an executive car it is developing for launch in the second half of the 1990s. Kia is also discussing the engine project with other carmakers in Japan and Europe. Weekend, Page X   Companies:-  Rover Group.     Kia Motors Corp.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT933-4601 ,"FT933-4601 _AN-DIHB8ADYFT 930908   FT  08 SEP 93 / Piech says VW is too fat      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest volume carmaker, is a duck which has grown too fat to fly, according to chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech. But it has sprouted a new feather - a DM12m (Pounds 4.8m) group profit in July - and more are growing all the time, he said yesterday. All the profit, compared with a DM1.6bn loss in the first half of the year, stemmed from improvements at the German parent company, where Mr Piech and his controversial production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, have focused much effort. The workforce had responded with stunning enthusiasm to the implementation of a refined continuous improvement programme, Mr Piech said. Productivity targets for this year in German plants had been achieved in only six months. 'I was faced with having to move a two-tonne rock. It was impossible but I got so much help that now it is rolling and gathering momentum like a flywheel,' he claimed. The workforce had promised to deliver quality in the VW range by next year comparable with that of the Toyota Lexus luxury car. But Seat, the Spanish subsidiary, remains firmly grounded, and is one of the main causes of Mr Piech's recent retreat from confident forecasts of the group breaking even this year. He limited his forecasts to a promise that the parent company, which earned a net DM447m last year, would show a profit for 1993. Audi, VW's luxury car division, is also in less publicised difficulties. Output is down 34 per cent this year, according to Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, chairman. 'At the end of the year we shall be able to break even only if we do not lose any more sales,' he said. World sales had fallen 26 per cent, and Britain was the only market to register an increase. Deliveries to customers were up 26 per cent - compared with an overall rise in car sales of 9 per cent - to 17,000 in the first eight months.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

The result represented a SKr1.34bn improvement on 1993's figures and reflected cost-cutting, higher sales volumes and the weakness of the Swedish krona. The third-quarter profit of SKr144m was the group's second successive quarterly surplus. It ended a five-year stretch of losses that dated back to 1989, when General Motors of the US became a joint owner in the company, alongside Saab-Scania. In the third quarter of 1993 the group made a SKr369m loss. Saab's turnround was reflected in higher sales for the nine months, which rose to SKr13.06bn from SKr11.47bn. Retail sales jumped 24 per cent to 65,700 units from 52,800. The success of the group's new 900 model, launched last year, has been the most significant factor in the upturn. It accounted for 40,600 sales in the nine-month period, compared with 25,100 for the older and bigger Saab 9000. The company expects to sell about 92,000 cars in 1994, comfortably surpassing last year's 73,600 and the break-even level of 83,000. At one point the group hoped 1994 sales might climb as high as 95,000. A shortage of convertible and 3-door 900 models, particularly in the important US market, is the main reason it expects to fall short of this level. US sales are expected to reach 23,000, compared with 18,000 last year. The group's other improving markets include Sweden - where nine-month sales rose to 12,300 from 7,000 - Taiwan, Australia and Italy. The company said the weaker dollar would only have a limited impact on its 1994 figures, partly because of hedging. Saab has swallowed more than SKr8bn in new capital from its owners and accumulated losses of more than SKr11bn since General Motors became a shareholder and took over management. In 1993 the group made a SKr1.37bn loss.   Companies:-  Saab Automobile.   Countries:-  SEZ  Sweden, West Europe.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

0,FT941-12622 ,"FT941-12622 _AN-EA3BCAABFT 940129   FT  29 JAN 94 / Diesel cars bad for health, says report      By BRONWEN MADDOX and JOHN GRIFFITHS   The growing popularity of diesel cars is 'extremely bad for human health', according to the authors of a government report on air pollution. The report, published yesterday, vigorously attacks the 'green' image of diesel and says the engines produce high levels of gases and soot, causing breathing difficulties and cancer. 'If you want to buy a car that's good for the environment, buy a petrol-engined car with a catalytic converter,' said Professor Roy Harrison, a scientist based at Birmingham University and chairman of the group that produced the report. He believed a new tax on diesel to make it more expensive than petrol would be 'a good idea'. The motor industry, which as a producer of both petrol and diesel cars maintains it has 'no axe to grind', immediately launched a scathing attack on the report. It said that in reaching its conclusions the report had failed to take account of continuing 'enormous progress' in diesel engine technology which rendered most of the criticisms invalid. 'It is erroneous, misplaced, misguided and fundamentally unsound,' said Mr Roger King, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' public affairs director. The industry fears that uncertainties created by the report may slow recovery in the new car market. Diesel cars make up only 6 per cent of the national total, but last year accounted for a fifth of new car sales. Marketing has portrayed them as cheaper to run and environmentally 'friendly'. The report, commissioned by the Department of the Environment from the Quality of Urban Air Review Group, agrees diesel engines are cleaner than petrol cars. But it says that they produce more nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon particles and black smoke than petrol cars fitted with catalytic converters. Diesel cars emit less 'greenhouse' gases than petrol cars, but scientists say diesel particles may play a role in global warming. Car industry fears, Page 5   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Berndt Pischetsrieder, chairman, described the Spartanburg plant yesterday as 'only the first' of a global network of manufacturing sites which will preclude further expansion in Germany. BMW sees the plant as by far the single most important manufacturing step it has taken outside of Europe. Mr Pischetsrieder insisted the plant, where 570 employees earn little more than one-half of their German counterparts, and which - on current exchange rates - has costs some 30 per cent lower, was not a signal that BMW was 'emigrating' from manufacturing in Germany. However BMW's four existing plants could meet all foreseeable demand for its cars in Europe, within its strategy of remaining an 'exclusive' carmaker with a world market share of around 2 per cent. 'We don't want to grow in Europe,' said Mr Pischetsrieder. BMW would now concentrate on developing a global component supply infrastructure and manufacturing network for the BMW and Rover brands, he said. BMW has declared a long-term goal of producing 90,000 cars a year at the US plant, probably before the end of the decade. But according to Dr Helmut Panke, chairman and chief executive of BMW (US) Holding, and in charge of all BMW's North American activities, the plant may have to expand further - to 120,000 or 130,000 units annually - if BMW is to achieve the full benefits of flexibility within a global production system. 'In the long run there will be other opportunities . . . that's why we have a 1,000-acre (Spartanburg) site.' Although only being formally opened today, the plant has been in limited production since September. It is making only 12 cars a day but this is due to rise to 150 a day by the middle of next year and 300 a day in 1996. Initial production is of 3-series saloons, to be joined by a new open two-seater next September.   Companies:-  Bayerische Motoren Werke.     BMW (US) Holding.

The project has ambitious objectives to produce 60,000 vehicles a year by 1998 and to capture 10 per cent of the Indian car market by 2000. The investment over the next four years is expected to total FFr1.2bn (Dollars 220m). Peugeot said the project, one of a series of investment plans in India by international vehicle groups, reflected the strong growth potential of the market. He said the Indian car market was growing by about 15 per cent a year and should reach about 270,000 cars in 1994. By 2000 sales were expected to reach 500,000 cars. Under the agreement, the joint venture, dubbed PAL Peugeot will be controlled by the French and Indian partners. They will both hold about 28 per cent of the shares, with the balance held by institutional investors and the public through a share issue on the Bombay stock exchange. The joint venture will produce the five door version of the Peugeot 309, a medium-sized vehicle. The cars will be manufactured at PAL's Kalyan plant, 50km north of Bombay. The first 309s are expected to leave the production line next year, with volumes steadily increasing over the following three years. The joint venture agreement includes the re-tooling and modernisation of the Kalyan plant, which currently produces the NE118, a small car which uses Nissan engines. In the first year of the project, Peugeot estimates that between 5,000 and 6,000 309s will be built, with a local content ratio of about 15 per cent. The proportion will rise to about 80 per cent by 1998. The 309 will be a rival to the small cars produced by Maruti, the dominant player in the Indian car market, which has partnerships with Japanese manufacturers. Competition is expected to intensify as other international groups, including Ford and General Motors, start production in India.   Companies:-  PSA Peugeot Citroen.     Premier Automobile.

0,FT941-10532 ,"FT941-10532 _AN-EBIDBAC1FT 940209   FT  09 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: The cleaner choice - Should the green motorist choose a diesel or petrol car      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Many motorists seeking a car that is both economical and relatively inoffensive environmentally must have reached the end of last week in confusion over whether to choose a diesel or petrol vehicle. On Thursday, a UK government panel of scientists warned that increasing traffic density threatens to create harmful airborne levels of benzene, linked with a form of leukaemia. Nearly 80 per cent of airborne benzene comes from petrol cars. Only 9 per cent comes from diesels. The level of benzene would be much lower if most cars continued to use leaded petrol (benzene partly compensates for lead's absence). Yet for a long time motorists have been encouraged to switch to unleaded fuel to help to keep organ-damaging lead out of the atmosphere. Some motorists might have been tempted to explore the merits of diesel cars, heavily promoted by the motor industry recently as more environmentally-friendly and economical than petrol cars. Yet little over a week ago the Quality of Urban Air Review Group (Quarg), a panel of experts appointed by the UK's department of the environment, criticised diesel cars for their emissions of nitrogen oxides - a factor in smog formation and 'acid rain' - and tiny particulates strongly suspected of causing cancer. The panel warned in a report that by early next century there could be cause for 'considerable concern' about the deterioration of air quality in urban streets if diesel cars continue their current strong sales acceleration - they already account for about one in five new cars sold in the UK. Not surprisingly, the report prompted an instant, hostile response from the motor industry, which had been given no prior warning of it. Car makers said it was 'misplaced, misguided and fundamentally unsound'. The industry's concern is understandable to some extent. The UK car market is still at a fairly early stage of recovery from one of its steepest recessions on record, and is worried that confused motorists might now, if only temporarily, opt to stay out of the showrooms. An adverse report on diesels' possible carcinogenic hazards in the 1980s helped to reverse Germany's diesel boom and hit car sales overall. And while the German market has begun to climb again, some in the diesel car industry such as John Maddell, a senior executive of Lucas Industries, say it led to Germany's motor industry losing its technological lead to the French. Now that the furore over the Quarg report has faded, it is becoming apparent that the differences between the motor industry and the panel are more in degree than fundamentals. The industry retains its belief that the panel, in arriving at its 'considerable concern' warning, is not taking enough account of technological progress being made to further reduce the two pollutants - nitrogen oxides and particulates - for which diesel has been most criticised. The report pays due tribute to the advantages of diesel over petrol. These include much reduced emissions of carbon dioxide, the inescapable by-product of combustion linked with global warming, and of two other pollutants, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. It acknowledges that, currently at least, commercial vehicles - mainly trucks and buses - are much bigger culprits than diesel cars in terms of poor urban air quality. At the heart of the Quarg report lie its projections about the share of the total car market likely to be taken by diesel cars and the effect that this will have in terms of all the pollutants they emit but mainly particulates - of which the notorious black diesel smoke forms only a part (see above chart). What the panel views as the potential reduction of particulate emissions through technological progress - and tighter EC emissions standards for all cars from 1996 - is apparent in the chart. At a constant 16 per cent share of the market, the amount of particulates emitted by diesel cars would be halved from around 65 kilotonnes to 30 kilotonnes by the year 2005. However, in the steepest growth scenario, with the diesel share of new car sales rising to 49 per cent, the volume of particulates emitted would be little changed from 1991 levels and government goals of improved urban air quality would be unfulfilled. The industry's complaint is that this scenario does not take adequate account of current and future developments in diesel technology; that diesels tend to maintain a consistent emissions performance whereas petrol engines and their catalysts degrade and become much 'dirtier' after 50,000 miles; and that the relative lack of large-scale testing of vehicles in use in city centres downplays the heavy emission of pollutants by catalyst-equipped petrol cars on short journeys because their 'cats' do not reach full operating temperature. In reality, the jury will be out for some time before either side can be proved right. Industry technologists maintain that substantial improvements are still to come from refining technologies already in use, such as exhaust gas recirculation and electronic management of fuel systems. Still several years away, however, are possible leaps in anti-pollution technology for diesel vehicles. Most promising among them is an oxidation catalyst for diesels, mainly to cut nitrogen oxide but also capable of reducing particulate emissions. This research is being led by Japan, and the Mazda car company is believed to be near to making them commercially available. Research is also continuing on particulate 'traps', which would capture the particles and then burn them off at intervals. When these are coupled with the introduction of low-sulphur diesel fuels, the volume of both particulates and nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel cars should fall substantially. Under a recent EC directive, the permitted level of sulphur in diesel fuel will fall from around 0.5 per cent by weight now to 0.2 per cent by weight on October 1 this year and to 0.05 per cent in October 1996. 'The problem could easily disappear,' says Roger King, spokesman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Whether it does or not, the industry's fears that the public will shun diesel cars on environmental grounds may be exaggerated. Car makers last week were reporting few signs of customer concern.

He added bellicose absurd remarks that when  circumstances do not permit dialogue, it was also the  government's consistent stance to take strict measures against  the North.    These very dangerous provocative absurd remarks are leading  the situation on the Korean peninsula to a phase of war  [chonjaeng kungmyon] and are outraging our people.    As everyone knows, the whole world recognizes that the  nuclear issue in our country is an issue to be resolved between  us and the United States. The reason the nuclear issue has been  raised on the Korean peninsula is because the United States is  increasing the risk of nuclear war [haekchonjaeng wihom] by  introducing more than 1,000 nuclear weapons of various types to  South Korea; is deploying them in forward positions in the areas  adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line; and is conducting  nuclear war exercises, including the Team Spirit military  exercise, against the Northern half of the Republic every day.    Therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should  be resolved between us and the United States -- the party that  introduced nuclear weapons to South Korea and that is increasing  the risk of nuclear war. The South Korean puppets are not  qualified to interfere in the resolution of the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula. They only have to act according to the  decisions made through negotiations between us and the United  States.    If the South Korean puppets have anything to say concerning  the nuclear issue, they should frankly apologize to all nations  for bringing U.S. nuclear weapons to the land of South Korea to  spread nuclear disaster among their fellow countrymen and for  increasing the risk of nuclear war with the United States, and  should ask to be given due punishment. It is intolerable that  Han Sung-chu did not mention one word about this in his attempt  to interfere in the resolution of the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula.    It is ridiculous that the South Korean puppets, which can  hardly be called human beings as they are first-class colonial  hunting dogs and flunkyist nation-sellers, are trying to  interfere in the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.    What cannot be overlooked is that South Korean puppets are  raving about some kind of resolute measures while the United  States is threatening ultimatums by setting a deadline for us to  accept the full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal] of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].    The South Korean puppets have so far made innumerable  criminal outbursts disparaging us under the pretext of the  nuclear issue. However, considering the fact that they spat out  more belligerent outbursts, such as a stern measure, we can be  well aware that the rascals' new war provocation moves have  entered a very grave stage.    The South Korean puppets have committed every strategic move  to frustrate the DPRK-U.S. talks during the past period. Today,  the process of peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula is facing a crisis situation because of the  betrayal of the United States [onul migugui paesin  haengwirohaeso chosonbando haengmunjeui pyonghwajok haegyol  kwajongi wigi sanghwange noigedoeja]. With this situation as a  motive, the South Korean puppets are frantically running wild to  prevent the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks from being realized  and to bring about a nuclear war in our country, which will  annihilate the entire nation in collusion with foreign forces.    Under the pretext of the so-called meeting, Han Sung-chu  will  visit the United States from 16 to 22 February, meet with the  U.S. President and secretary of state, establish the final U.S.  and ROK position, and discuss a follow-up measure regarding the  IAEA decision based on the North's attitude. This is one of the  criminal moves to crush the fellow countrymen in collusion with  foreign forces.    Even Han Sung-chu babbled about dialogue, this is nothing  but  a brazen-faced maneuver to cover up their antinational,  antipeaceful, and antireunification activity, which is driving  our country's situation into the brink of a war.    It is unreasonable for the South Korean puppets, who are  trying to enforce the large-scale nuclear war exercise against  our Republic in collusion with the United States and deploy  Patriot missiles to South Korea, to talk about holding dialogue  with us.    Babbling about dialogue while wielding guns [chongdae] is,  in  fact, an insult to dialogue and negation of dialogue. Han  Sung-chu confessed that a stern measure is a consistent  position. Thus, the unchangeable real intention of the puppets,  who are not interested in North-South dialogue at all and are  trying to separate and crush our Republic in collusion with  foreign forces, becomes clearer.    Facts show that the South Korean puppets are rushing toward  the road to North-South confrontation and war, not toward peace  and peaceful reunification, and that they do not hesitate to  endanger the entire nation with a nuclear holocaust.    The entire nation set this year as the year for the great  national unity and is accelerating the great advance for  national reunification. The South Korean puppets, however, are  taking the road to war and are the traitorous group that cannot  live together under the same sky.    The South Korean puppets should look straight at our  people's  will and determination and act with discretion. The rascals'  reckless new war provocation will only result in their own  destruction.     "

The group's supervisory board yesterday approved a five-year spending plan that will inject almost DM76bn (Pounds 31bn) into the business by the end of 1997. More than half, DM45.3bn, will be spent on the vehicles business, while the rest will further bolster the group's leasing and sales financing arm, estimated to have a 20 per cent share of the German leasing market alone. An earlier expenditure programme for 1992-96 had earmarked DM51bn for investment in vehicles. A statement published after the meeting, the first under the guidance of Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman since January 1, said adjustments were in the light of the current economic situation. All projects were under review, it added. However, present difficulties appear to have damped only modestly the group's plans, which include construction of a DM4.3bn plant in Mosel, a new works in China and expansion of the Seat and Skoda subsidiaries. Spending in vehicles divisions in this financial year will fall below DM9bn, compared with DM9.9bn last time, the company said, but rise later to average more than DM9m a year. There was no mention of further job cuts or other economies, widely expected after Volkswagen's slump into loss in the fourth quarter of last year, warnings of a dividend cut, and company forecasts of a 20 per cent fall in domestic demand for cars this year. The group, which employs 273,000 worldwide, cut almost 7,000 jobs last year, pruned planned investment spending by DM3bn, and imposed extensive short-time working at the turn of the year. The likelihood of a further 30,000 job cuts by the end of next year, as suggested in some reports, is still unclear. The supervisory board also appointed Mr Martin Poth, personnel director, to a newly created role as board member responsible for the Asia-Pacific region.

'I wish that the Volkswagen group, instead of saying they would fully co-operate with the public prosecutors, would actually do so. It is lip service. It is not endorsed by action.' If charges were made, it would be 'a case of industrial espionage of unbelievable proportions,' Mr Hughes said. 'An industrial version of Watergate.' VW said yesterday it was co-operating fully with the state prosecutors and that Mr Hughes' remarks were 'unjust'. It was in VW's interest that the matter be cleared up as quickly as possible, said Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs, VW spokesman. The prosecutors have been investigating for more than four months the alleged theft of thousands of confidential documents from General Motors, the US carmaker and from Opel, its German subsidiary, in connection with the defection to Volkswagen in March of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's former global purchasing director, along with several of his former GM colleagues. Mr Lopez is now the VW group's production and purchasing director. The prosecutors raided VW's head office in Wolfsburg and several other locations late last month. The alleged theft concerns the disappearance of highly sensitive GM documents which the US group says are vital to its competitive standing, including the prices it pays suppliers for components, lists of its components suppliers, and confidential details of its future product programmes stretching through the 1990s. 'It would be good if Mr Piech (VW chief executive) and Mr (Klaus) Liesen (chairman of the VW supervisory board) would send a letter to VW employees saying that, without any danger to their job security or their relationship with their supervisors, they should say what they know of this case.'

The newcomer would be unveiled in September with deliveries starting next year, Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, Audi chief executive said yesterday. The venture would help to stabilise lossmaking Porsche, but association with such a high-quality manufacturer would help Audi to establish itself alongside Mercedes-Benz and BMW as a top marque. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chief executive, is a member of the family which controls Porsche. Last week, he unveiled a DM1.25bn (Dollars 781m) first-quarter loss for the group. He was head of Audi until the end of last year. Audi had fallen into loss in the first quarter, Mr Kortum said, during which production had been slashed 42 per cent to 76,000 cars. But in contrast to the parent, which is aiming to break even in the full 12 months, Audi was well placed to show a profit, he said. Deliveries to customers in the first three months of this year, down 31 per cent at 95,000 vehicles had been partly maintained from stocks built up after the downturn in the second half of 1992. Sales in Germany were so far down 37 per cent at 43,000 units and turnover had fallen 36 per cent to DM2.8bn. Full 1992 figures, released yesterday, showed net profits down to DM172m from DM370m on record turnover of DM16.7bn and peak deliveries of 490,000 cars. For this year, Audi expected to benefit from lower input costs from co-ordinated buying and job cuts. Some 4,000 of the 37,700 workers are expected to go, bringing the workforce down to levels last seen 10 years ago, when the company made 380,000 cars a year. 'The joint venture with Porsche makes it self-evident that we are talking about a very sporty vehicle,' Mr Kortum added.

The fall, the second consecutive year in which car production has declined, underlines the severity of the decline in Japanese personal consumption in the past year. Car makers played down the significance of a modest pick-up in car production in March, about 0.8 per cent up from the year before. The Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association says that in spite of the increase in output, new car sales in the first half of April were more than 10 per cent down on last year. Japanese vehicle makers produced 12,334,999 cars, buses and trucks in the year. Domestic sales fell by 7.4 per cent to 6.9m units, while exports fell by 2.9 per cent to about 5.66m vehicles. Passenger car production fell 4.3 per cent at 9.3m units, while truck production was about 12 per cent down at 1.9m. The restructuring forced on car producers by the downturn took another small step forward yesterday when two car producers, Nissan and Isuzu, announced an agreement for Nissan to supply Isuzu with minibuses which would be marketed under Isuzu's name. The spread of the consumer downturn was reflected in an 8.8 per cent fall in department store sales in March from a year before. Sales fell to Y772.5bn (Pounds 4.47bn), the 13th consecutive monthly drop. Excluding an 8.9 per cent fall in March 1990 the decline last month was the sharpest recorded since the department stores association started collecting data in 1965. The economic outlook was further complicated yesterday when three long term credit banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, Long Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank, announced a 0.2 percentage point rise in their prime lending rate to 5.1 per cent, which some analysts believe may begin an upward movement in Japanese interest rates.

Nissan shipped 182,207 cars worth nearly Pounds 1bn to 36 countries. Rover exported 161,932. Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders statistics show that Vauxhall came in a distant third with 72,090, even including production from its IBC commercial and utility vehicles ventures. Nissan's Japanese rivals in the UK, Toyota and Honda, began production only at the beginning of last year and consequently trailed far behind Nissan. Toyota exported 27,735 cars and Honda 27,121. Nissan's exports accounted for some 75 per cent of last year's 246,000 total output at its plant near Sunderland. However, Mr Ian Gibson, Nissan's managing director in the UK, warned yesterday that the company's output this year is unlikely to match 1993 levels because of the continuing deep recession in continental European car markets. Mr Gibson said Nissan was viewing the current year with caution and projecting production of between 200,000 and 240,000 units. The steepness of the decline in continental markets last year was such that Nissan was obliged to introduce single-shift working in the final quarter as well as an 'agreed severance' scheme which saw the Sunderland work force fall from 4,600 to 4,250. Nevertheless, the plant is to return to two-shift production at the beginning of next month and Mr Gibson said employment had now stabilised. That is thanks partly to the strong recovery now being experienced in the UK new car market. Figures to be released later this week are expected to show that demand in January was 17 per cent higher than in the corresponding month a year before. Nissan, which has won two Queen's Awards for Export Achievement since 1988, has invested Pounds 900m in its UK manufacturing operations and claims 'local' (European) content of more than 80 per cent in the two models it produces, the small Micra and upper-medium Primera.

He has been appointed executive chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda, the UK luxury sports car maker. Oldfield will take over from Walter Hayes, chairman of Aston Martin since 1991, who will be 70 in April, the mandatory Ford retirement age. Hayes will remain on the board of Aston Martin, which became a 75 per cent-owned Ford subsidiary in 1987. Oldfield's move to Aston Martin has opened the way for the promotion of Richard Parry-Jones, Ford of Europe's chief engineer for vehicle engineering  -and a rising star in the Ford organisation - to become Ford of Europe vice president for product programmes and vehicle engineering and design. Parry-Jones, 42, will become a key member of the new generation management team that is being formed at Ford of Europe by Jacques Nasser, 46. Nasser took over as chairman in January last year with the task of halting the mounting losses of Ford's European operations. Parry-Jones's position as head of all of Ford's car development and engineering in Europe will be crucial to determining the US carmaker's fortunes in Europe during the second half of the 1990s and beyond. An engineer educated at Salford University, he joined Ford in 1969 and has held senior positions in product planning, engineering and manufacturing in Europe and in the US. He will take over from Oldfield responsibility for forcing the implementation of simultaneous engineering methods in Ford of Europe with the aim of wringing greater efficiency and productivity out of Ford's product and manufacturing engineering operations in the UK and in Germany.

'He got in touch with me. I did not try to woo him,' Mr Piech said yesterday in an interview with the Financial Times. Mr Lopez, currently at the centre of a storm over alleged industrial espionage, eventually quit GM and joined VW in mid-March. 'We got to know each other and discovered we thought in similar ways,' Mr Piech said. Mr Lopez's move had nothing to do with money, Mr Piech said. 'He has less income now than he had before.' The timing and the nature of the contacts between the two men, around six months after Mr Lopez was promoted to the top ranks of GM in the US, puts paid to speculation that he was lured away by Mr Piech. It suggests that Mr Lopez was planning his defection over an extended period. He was followed by seven former colleagues, who are due to appear in court in Frankfurt today to challenge a legal attempt by GM to prevent them from continuing to work for VW for up to one year. The court case is one of several launched by GM and Adam Opel, its German subsidiary, based on their belief that Mr Lopez and his team took secret GM documents with them when they left Detroit. Mr Piech disclosed yesterday that VW had already successfully fought several legal skirmishes with GM. 'We have four rounds behind us and VW has made no mistakes.' The VW chairman, who on Monday broke his recent silence with a statement supporting Mr Lopez, said any possible legal charges would be answered in court. Mr Piech dismissed suggestions that VW's actions in hiring away Mr Lopez and his seven colleagues from GM had caused widespread dismay in German industry, and was at odds with the style of German business.

Mercedes, the car division of Daimler-Benz, is due to hold a news conference in the US on Monday at which analysts expect it to announce plans to build a sporty, four-wheel drive vehicle in the US. The company yesterday declined to comment. Mr Helmut Werner, the Mercedes management board chairman, said two months ago that a US plant 'was a high, high priority. BMW broke ground last September for a new Dollars 400m plant in South Carolina after a three-year world-wide search for a suitable manufacturing site outside Germany. The plant is to produce a new model for both the US and export markets. The German companies want to manufacture in the US partly because of lower production costs there than in Germany, partly to protect themselves against currency swings, and partly to revive their fortunes in the US - the world's largest car market. Sales of German cars have been hit by tax changes, the arrival of Japanese luxury car manufacturers and a revival in Detroit's competitiveness. Analysts speculated yesterday that Mercedes intended to plump for North Carolina as the site of its new plant. The company's Freightliner subsidiary, the US market leader in heavy trucks, already manufactures in the state, which is a favourite for German companies with US subsidiaries. Manufacturing in the US would hold risks for Mercedes. It is unclear whether American buyers of the company's cars would regard their engineering and construction quite so highly with a 'made in the US' tag on the vehicles, rather than German origin. However, car buyers have been demonstrating an increasing resistance to paying the high prices demanded by Mercedes for German prestige. Audi, the up-market division of Volkswagen, is due to decide later this year on whether to build a North American plant.   Companies:-  Mercedes-Benz.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

While Daimler's group net earnings are expected to slump by 30 per cent to around DM1bn (Pounds 400m), Mercedes should show a result 'similar' to last year's DM849m, Mr Helmut Werner, incoming chief executive, said yesterday. This implies that the group's non-automotive businesses, including Deutsche Aerospace, AEG engineering and the Debis software and financial services division, will contribute a mere 15 per cent of total earnings, against 42 per cent last time. In conditions one executive described as 'ploughing through fog', Mr Werner Niefer, retiring chief executive, said attempts to prepare forecasts were blighted by 'many imponderables'. The company had high hopes of its new compact C-class range, a replacement for the 10-year-old 190 series, the company's smaller executive car, which will be launched in June, but he did not expect any marked improvement in markets for cars, buses or trucks before the end of this year. The so-called C-class was expected to start having a positive effect on operating results by next year, when, according to one manager, the company hoped to snatch back market leadership from BMW. Last year Mercedes was overtaken in unit sales by its Bavarian rival for the first time. Mercedes expects to build 200,000 of the new model in 1994, compared with output of 120,000 compact cars in 1992. This year, however, Mr Niefer said he expected total car output unchanged from last year's 486,000 while commercial vehicles would fall slightly from the 1992's 260,000. In the 1993 first quarter, turnover from cars had fallen 30 per cent, while unit sales had dropped 32 per cent. Sales revenue from commercial vehicles was 16 per cent lower on unit deliveries down 20 per cent. As part of continuing economy measures, at least a further 7,000 German jobs will be lost this year, after a cut of 14,700 in 1992.

This contained profit projections which were much lower than many analyst had forecast. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the German motor group, said the plan was based on a much more cautious set of assumptions than VW's previous plans and this was especially true for market share and volume forecasts. He told analysts the figures in its internal plan represented a level which could also be achieved under difficult circumstances. 'Of course, it is our intention to exceed this planning in reality.' VW has not said what the plan contains. The report of the internal figures, believed to contain a pre-tax profit projection for 1995 of about DM890m (Dollars 567m) which was well below market expectations, depressed the share price and led analysts to wonder if the company was playing down the extent of the recovery from heavy losses. This could help create the right climate for more cost-cutting and for government financial inducements to encourage the trading in of old cars. The VW planning document reportedly said the 1995 result could be up to DM200m higher or lower than in the plan, and sales would rise only modestly next year with price rises being difficult to implement. The 1998 turnover target of DM104bn was believed to have been revised to DM100bn in 1999. In 1993, VW made a DM1.94bn net loss on sales of DM76.5bn. Mr Piech said although VW had performed well in the first 10 months, with world sales up by 7 per cent to 2.75m vehicles, a lasting car market upturn was not in sight. This was shown by the way markets had developed in the second half of 1994. He said VW was starting its reconstruction, with only 20 per cent of the intended improvements achieved. Progress had been made in cutting costs and improving quality, but much work lay ahead before VW would be in the forefront of world competition.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

In the five years to the end of 1991, vehicle theft in the UK rose by an alarming 50 per cent. More than 626,000 vehicles were reported stolen in 1991, a rise of nearly a fifth over 1990; 225,000 were not recovered. Disturbingly, the UK leads the EC in vehicle theft, with owners having a one in 32 chance of their vehicles being stolen. In the US, it is one in 117. Manufacturers build in electronic and other safety systems and drivers can put heavy locks on to their steering wheels whenever they leave their cars. But a new anti-theft detection system, called Tracker, will shortly be available in the UK, following its introduction in the US (under the name of LoJack System) a few years ago. Tracker is based on a small transponder, which will be sold to vehicle owners and hidden in cars or trucks by trained installers. When a theft is reported, a telecommunications system linked to the central computer of Tracker Network - the newly formed company operating Tracker in the UK - will send a digitally coded radio signal to the device in the stolen vehicle. Police officers in cars fitted with a special direction finder will be able to detect the tracking signal and find the stolen vehicle. The transponder can be installed in up to 30 possible locations in a vehicle. Motorists will be able to buy Tracker units for Pounds 160 (Pounds 220 for heavy trucks), with an annual fee of Pounds 61.10. The company says most police forces in Britain have agreed to use the tracking equipment, with others likely to operate it soon. Several big insurance companies have said they will offer discounts (as in the US) of between 7 and 15 per cent on premiums to vehicle owners subscribing to Tracker.

The field trial, preparations for which began back at the  beginning of 1994 [as published], will be based on the Greven  mail center near Muenster in Westphalia. The large-scale trial  grew out of studies by the postal service as to how part of its  diesel vehicle fleet could be replaced by propulsion systems  that caused less pollution. A novel zinc-air power system  emerged as a promising prospect, although it is not without its  expert critics as regards the overall ecobalance.    However, initial tests, involving outside inspectors, on the  new power system installed in a trial vehicle went off  successfully at the TUeV [Technical Monitoring Board] for  Bavaria and Saxony, its power and output values, which far  exceeded those of conventional batteries, and its ecological  acceptability proving particularly attractive.    Autonomy Range Considerably Extended    The trials centered on use in the postal service, where  requirements are three or four times higher than in the private  transport sector. Whereas electric vehicles with an accumulator  weight of 350 kg have had a range of about 40 km to date, the  new technology permits journeys of at least 300 km.    The large-scale field trials scheduled to begin in 1995 will  set out primarily to establish whether the zinc-air power system  is economically viable and what its infrastructure requirements  are. The latter is necessary because the power cells cannot be  charged like conventional storage batteries: The electrodes  have to be changed. The ``worn-out'' electrodes are  subsequently regenerated, after which they are ready for reuse.  This is why large-scale field trials can only be performed with  major fleet operators such as the postal service.    In addition to the postal service, in the role of project  leader, and Electric Fuel Limited, the inventor of the zinc-air  system, other well-known firms have agreed to take part in the  field trial. Some firms and town councils also want to  participate in the trial with parts of their own fleets.     "

The drop in earnings re-flected higher costs as manufacturers offered low-interest consumer loans to revive sluggish domestic demand. They also had increased costs associated with the production and marketing of several new car models. Hyundai Motor, the biggest Korean motor company, said net profits fell by 23 per cent to Won41.6bn (Dollars 52m), although sales rose by 8.5 per cent to Won6,079bn. Sales and profits were harmed in the last two months of 1992 as employees became involved in the presidential campaign of Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, causing sales activity to slacken. Hyundai was able to balance sluggish sales in South Korea and the US, traditionally its largest foreign market, by increasing exports to Europe, which became its biggest overseas customer last year. Kia Motors reported a 5.7 per cent decline in net profits to Won14.95bn as sales rose by 20 per cent to Won3,282bn. Earnings were depressed by costs involved with the introduction of the Potentia luxury car and the medium-range Sephia. It also had heavy investment spending in expanding production at its Asan Bay facility. Daewoo Motors, which is unlisted, continued to post losses. Its deficit shrank to Won90bn from Won146.7bn in 1991. Sales increased by 6.5 per cent to Won1,700bn. Asia Motors, which is a specialised manufacturer of commercial vehicles and affiliated with Kia Motors, suffered a 29 per cent fall in profits to Won7.4bn as demand weakened because of a downturn in the construction industry. Sales remained almost unchanged at Won970bn. Ssangyong Motor slipped into a deficit of Won8.75bn after registering a profit of Won9.38bn in 1991. Sales also fell by 15 per cent to Won340.8bn. The reverse was largely caused by increased competition in the market for the four-wheel drive vehicles, which Ssangyong monopolised until last year with its Korando model. The introduction of the Galloper by Hyundai Precision, a manufacturer of rolling stock and containers, sharply reduced Ssangyong's market share.   Companies:-  Hyundai Motor.     Kia Motors.

This week a focus of infection was revealed in  Moscow. A press conference held by the Russian State Committee  for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight (GKSEN) was devoted to an  analysis of the alarming situation now developing.    As was noted by Aleksandr Monisov, deputy chairman of the  GKSEN and assistant Russian chief state public health physician,  the epidemiological situation in Russia can be characterized  today as alarming. This is associated primarily with interstate  migration of the population within the CIS and abroad, and with  expansion of the channels of exchange of freight, goods, food  products and agricultural raw materials. Outbreaks and spreading  of dangerous infectious diseases such as plague, yellow fever,  typhoid fever and especially cholera have been observed in this  connection. Thus, an unprecedented cholera outbreak was observed  in 1992--El Tor Ogava vibrio was discovered in 68 countries of  the world, with the total number of patients being 461,000  persons (see table). This year 118,000 patients were revealed in  6 months. The largest proportion of infected individuals is  found in the countries of the Near and Central East--Pakistan,  Afghanistan, India, Turkey, Syria. An outbreak of cholera was  recently noted in a number of regions of Latin America as well.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |World Cholera Morbidity From 1983 to 1992 (Thousands of Cases)               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1983                                  |64                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1984-1989                             |29-48                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990                                  |70                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991                                  |594                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992                                  |461.7                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      As Mr Monisov noted, Russia has not been spared this fate  either. The last 3 years were extremely strained for Russian  epidemiologists: Following a mass outbreak of cholera in 1990 in  Stavropol imported from Syria (49 persons fell ill), the  situation stabilized, but not for long. This year an outbreak of  cholera epidemic imported from India and Turkey was noted (a  total of 17 patients in Makhachkala, Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar  and Naberezhnyye Chelny). However, medical workers are troubled  even more by the appearance of ``home-grown'' cholera, the  source of which is found in Russia's own biological environment.  Thus, this year medical workers noted three cholera foci in this  country. The first case was documented in May in Kaspiysk  (Dagestan)--a certain Sergey Makhin drank his fill of untreated  water from a canal. The result--cholera in its most acute form.  It was impossible to save the patient. His wife was infected as  well. A month later cholera vibrio was found in the body of a  4-month infant in Makhachkala. And then the most alarming  communication: On 8 August the police picked up Vladimir  Shabunov, a 40-year-old person without a permanent place of  residence, at Kursk Station in Moscow. He was in a coma. After  he underwent resuscitation El Tor Ogava cholera vibrio was  isolated from him. Twenty persons who had come in contact with  the patient were revealed. Cholera virus has already been  detected in the body of one of the orderlies. Yet another person  who had come into contact with Shabunov--a 26-year-old  driver--fled the hospital on 12 August, and the police are  actively searching for him.    The agent of cholera infection--El Tor Ogava vibrio--is  classified as a ``waterborne infection,'' and therefore it lives  and multiplies in the untreated water of open-air sources.  According to specialists 50 percent of Russia's population uses  water that potentially favors cholera infection.    Responding to questions from a KOMMERSANT-DAILY  correspondent, Mr Monisov said that the former USSR republics  through which infection penetrates to Russian territory  unhindered present the greatest danger to Russia. Thus, cholera  is raging now in Tajikistan. Over 100 patients have already been  documented, of whom 41 have died. Presence of infamous Somali  refugees in the country is also an unfavorable factor. They are  a ``risk factor'' not only in relation to cholera but also in  relation to the entire spectrum of dangerous infections. All of  this, Mr Monisov emphasized, led to the need for drafting a law  ``On Protection of Russian Federation Territory From Importation  and Spread of Especially Dangerous Infections'' and a federal  ``Migration'' program regulating migration processes.

Volkswagen acquired VAG (United Kingdom), the British distributor of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, from Lonrho, the UK-based international trading group, for Pounds 124m at the end of last year. Following the takeover the German carmaker wants to expand substantially its presence in Britain, which has traditionally been one of its weakest markets in Europe. Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of west European new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent in the UK. Mr Detlef Wittig, sales director for the VW brand worldwide and the recently appointed chairman of VAG (United Kingdom), said the company had set a target of capturing 7.5 per cent of UK new-car sales by 1998. The target announced by Mr Wittig is a significant retreat, however, from the much more aggressive UK expansion outlined by Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chairman of the Volkswagen group and chairman of the VW volume car division, in March. Mr Goeudevert announced that the group was seeking to double the VW/Audi share in the UK to more than 11 per cent by the late 1990s. He has been forced to reduce the group's ambitions in the face of VW's financial difficulties and the growing level of competition in the UK. In the drive for a higher British sales volume it is being forced to modify its traditional premium pricing in the UK and to seek higher fleet and company car sales. The VW group plans to increase the separation of the retail sales operations of the VW and Audi brands in the UK. It aims to increase the number of dealers selling only the VW make from 100 to 130, while reducing the number of joint VW/Audi dealers to 190 from 220 at present.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

VW signed a letter of intent in Beijing yesterday under which it is planned that FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Company, the joint venture company in which it holds 40 per cent, will take over the assembly of the Audi 100 in China. This car has been assembled under licence since 1988 by FAW, which is chiefly a producer of light commercial vehicles and also produces the Chinese state limousine, the 'Red Flag'. The Volkswagen group is already the leading carmaker in China, one of the world's fastest growing car markets, with two joint ventures in Changchun and Shanghai. It is developing capacity to produce more than 330,000 cars a year in China by 1996, by which time the country is likely to be its third most important market worldwide. VW said yesterday that FAW had assembled more than 45,000 Audi 100s since the start of assembly under licence. Capacity is being raised in order to produce 30,000 Audi cars a year by 1995. The Audi 100 is the only car selected by the Chinese authorities for use by senior state officials. FAW-Volkswagen Automotive, which is to take over control of the Audi 100 assembly, is already developing a plant in Changchun to produce 150,000 cars a year by 1996 in a DM1.5bn project including engine and gearbox manufacturing as well as car assembly. The joint venture will assemble VW Golf/Jetta-sized cars both for the domestic Chinese market and for export to other markets in south-east Asia. Small-scale production has already started on the basis of assembling CKD kits (completely knocked-down) supplied from Germany and South Africa, with 8,050 VW Jettas produced in China last year. Volkswagen formed its first joint venture in China in 1985 when it took a 50 per cent stake in the Shanghai-Volkswagen Automobile Company for the local production of the VW Santana.

The project, which will increase capacity at the Solihull factory producing the car, is to be completed early next year. The announcement marks the first substantial investment programme to be launched by Rover since it was taken over by German car maker BMW at the start of the year. Rover executives stressed last night that the project would be financed from Rover's own earnings. There would be no contribution from BMW, which bought Rover for Pounds 800m plus debt assumptions and which pledged to allow Rover to operate autonomously. 'It had been envisaged for some time, before the BMW takeover in fact, that the investment would be necessary in order to meet soaring demand,' Rover said. The expansion will allow Land Rover, the Rover group's four-wheel-drive subsidiary, to increase production of the Discovery by 20 per cent to 1,500 a week and confirm it as one of the most successful vehicles ever to be launched by Rover, formerly BL. The model was launched in 1989 at a production rate of 270 a week and within a few months became the UK's best selling four-wheel-drive model. Since then production has been increased a total of nine times, creating an extra 1,600 jobs at the Solihull factory, which now employs 9,700. It is expected that the latest expansion will create some further jobs, although Rover said last night it was too early to say how many. Discovery sales last year reached 36,433 vehicles world-wide, representing half of Land Rover's total sales. Its image is sufficiently good for Honda, which is still collaborating with Rover despite the BMW takeover, to sell the vehicle under its own name, the Honda Crossroads, in Japan. The expansion is one of the biggest spending projects on a single plant to be announced by Rover in recent years. The increase in production is designed partly to cater for demand in the North American market, where the Discovery was launched only three months ago.   Companies:-  Rover Group.     Land Rover.

Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's production and purchasing director, is to issue a complaint against General Motors, his former employer, to counter legal moves made by the US group against him. Mr Lopez's professional reputation had been so damaged that he wanted to defend himself legally, a VW spokesman said. His move followed GM's announcement on Friday that it had filed a legal complaint in Germany against Mr Lopez 'for what we believe is the taking of confidential documents'. Officials from the public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt near Frankfurt are expected to question Mr Lopez, his colleagues and representatives of the US concern to find if there are grounds for further action. The renewed eruption follows successful legal action last month by Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, in which it won an injunction preventing VW from poaching its employees. Opel had alleged that some 40 German personnel had been approached by Mr Lopez or his associates. Mr Lopez, formerly head of GM's global purchasing, with a formidable reputation for cost-cutting, was lured to VW in March by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's new head, who recently announced a DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) loss for the first quarter. Although VW said at the weekend that the group had 'absolutely no' GM documents, Mr David Herman, managing director of Adam Opel, said responses from Mr Lopez to a series of requests for assurances that he had not taken confidential information had not been 'satisfactory'. The news magazine Der Spiegel added to the controversy on Saturday with allegations that Mr Lopez had thousands of documents, including parts purchasing lists and details of all Opel's engine and model plans for the next 10 years. VW dismissed the claims as 'untenable and unbelievable'. According to Mr Herman, settling the issue was 'of the utmost importance for the future competitiveness of Opel and GM'.

He has been Rover's point of contact with Honda as the two companies worked together over new models and fostered co-operative manufacturing. Although Rover and Honda exchanged board members, the arrangements for collaboration under that level were loose. Rover never had a group of people who spent all their time collaborating with Honda. The role of Mr Bacchus was to facilitate contacts whenever they were needed. And he has been making about 18 trips to Japan every year to that end. Another frequent visitor to Tokyo has been Mr Alan Curtis, managing director of product supply at Rover and responsible for bringing new models to market. But neither side ever had a permanent presence in the plants or offices of the other. At working level the Rover and Honda executives who came into contact most frequently were the designers and engineers. Rover formed teams to undertake projects and tasks. When the work was complete the team would be dissolved, its members moving on to something else. Practically, the collaboration of the two companies was done on an ad hoc basis - 'as the need arose - interface at any level,' as Rover put it yesterday. As an example Rover designers spent considerable time in Tokyo when they were developing the 600 model. The changes in Rover's manufacturing processes over the last 15 years have been helped by a running series of visits to Honda factories, but executives learned more from the Honda plants in the US than they did from those in Japan. 'In the US you could see how the Japanese adapted to western structures,' Rover explained. The contacts have resulted in a growing network of executives across the two companies accustomed to co-operating with each other, which has so far been unaffected by the BMW purchase. 'Many friendships will continue regardless,' said one Rover executive.   Companies:-  Rover Group.     Honda Motor.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

Nissan, which began volume-car assembly in the UK in 1986, increased production last year by 63.6 per cent to 124,666 from 76,190 in 1990 according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Nissan will remain a vital factor in the development of UK car production for the next two years with output forecast to rise to 175,000 this year and 270,000 next year. The company's efforts will be helped by the introduction of a second car range this summer. Honda and Toyota, the other Japanese carmakers developing assembly plants in the UK, will both begin volume assembly by the end of the year. Honda will start at its Swindon, Wiltshire, plant in October and Toyota in Burnaston near Derby in December. Overall UK car output fell 4.5 per cent to 1,236,900 last year, largely as a result of a 13.8 per cent fall in Rover car production and a 24.5 per cent drop in output by Peugeot, the French carmaker, at its Ryton, Coventry, assembly plant. Rover car output fell last year to 359,951, a figure which includes 35,952 Honda Concertos assembled by Rover. Ford's UK vehicle output (including Jaguar and Aston Martin) fell 3.7 per cent to 484,639 from 503,525 a year earlier, largely as a result of the 45.2 per cent decline in production by Jaguar, a Ford subsidiary. The recession in the UK and in the US took a heavy toll on UK luxury car output, hitting Rolls-Royce as well as Jaguar.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK VEHICLE PRODUCTION  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1991       1990      1991/90                               Jan-Dec     Jan-Dec    % Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS Total                       1,236,900   1,295,611        -4.5 Rover (British Aerospace)     395,624     464,612       -14.8  -cars****                    359,951     417,351       -13.8  -Range Rover/Discovery        35,673      47,261       -24.5 Ford (excl.

The government is also prepared to consider suggestions for other detailed changes to the proposed company car tax reforms announced in the Budget, the Inland Revenue said yesterday. Any further changes must be aimed at achieving the objective of 'a fair and efficient tax charge on company cars'. The present system of company car taxation is to be significantly overhauled with the introduction of a new scheme from April 1994. The chancellor said in the Budget that the new system was intended to make the tax charged on company cars a more fair measure of the benefit people received. The new system should eliminate distortions in the new car market and encourage the use of more fuel-efficient cars. The present broad scale of charges will be replaced by a new measure of the benefit of a car for private use, based on a charge equivalent to 35 per cent of the list price of the car. There will be a discount of a third if the employee drives more than 2,500 business miles in a year, or two thirds if the employee drives 18,000 or more business miles. The most significant further change announced yesterday in the Finance Bill makes provision for employees who contribute capital sums to the initial expenditure on their company cars - for example in order to have particular accessories added to their cars. The bill defines the the list price of a car as 'the price for the car published by the manufacturer, distributor or importer of the car, when the car was first registered, including VAT and any other relevant tax and any delivery charge; plus the price for any optional accessories provided with the car when it was first made available to the employee'.

BMW becomes the only European car maker with a passenger vehicle assembly plant in the US, although it will be joined in 1996/97 by Mercedes-Benz, its big domestic rival, which is developing a plant in Alabama. Japanese car makers have been expanding rapidly in North America during the last decade, while the European presence has shrunk drastically. None of the European volume car makers has a production base in the US following the move by Volkswagen of Germany to close its plant at Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, in 1987 after nine years of production. BMW has invested Dollars 400m to develop its new plant at Spartanburg, South Carolina. It said yesterday that production would reach 300 cars a day by the end of 1996. Toward the end of the decade the capacity of the plant will be increased to 90,000 units a year. Initially BMW is producing its 3-Series car range at the US plant, but from the end of 1995 the Spartanburg facility will become BMW's only production source for a new range of two-seater sports cars, which will be sold both in North America and in other BMW markets worldwide. Mercedes-Benz is investing Dollars 300m to develop a plant near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for the production of a new range of four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles, which are to be launched in the world market in 1997. The plant will employ 1,500 people and will produce 60,000 vehicles a year. The European car production presence in the US will still be modest by comparison with the capacity developed by Japanese vehicle makers, which last year produced more than 2m cars and light trucks at 10 plants - wholly owned and joint ventures - in the US and Canada.

'We have a right to be sceptical,' Mr David Herman, chairman of GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel, said yesterday. 'It would be a real tour de force' if Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's former procurement chief who is now at VW, had managed to develop a new concept between mid-March, when he left the US, and mid-June when he announced VW's plans. Mr Herman was responding to claims in a letter received from VW in which Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, said the German company did not have any confidential plans or documents about GM's ultra-low-cost factory project. Mr Herman confirmed that he had written to Mr Piech before Mr Lopez's announcement, suggesting that he consider the possible consequences if VW's project were the same as the one developed at GM under Mr Lopez's direction. At the time Mr Herman wrote, German state prosecutors were investigating the US group's complaints that Mr Lopez and colleagues took secret documents with them when they absconded to VW. The German company has consistently rebutted the charges. It will be extremely difficult for Adam Opel to show a profit this year, Mr Gail Gunderson, finance director, said yesterday. Confirming a slump in net earnings to DM202m (Dollars 119m) last year compared with DM1bn in 1991, he said he expected 1993 turnover to fall 18 per cent to about DM24bn. The company had been profitable in the first five months, Mr Gunderson added. According to Mr Herman, German registrations of new Opel brand vehicles had fallen 21 per cent to 244,000 in the first six months. Production in the German concern had dropped 15.6 per cent to around 500,000, while deliveries fell from 670,000 to 568,000. He could not see any grounds for optimism in the second half. 'On the contrary, we will have to adjust production in our works to further falls in demand,' he said.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     General Motors Corp.     Adam Opel.

0,FT941-12125 ,"FT941-12125 _AN-EBADGADUFT 940201   FT  01 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Rover unleashed   Even five years ago the idea that Rover and BMW were complementary marques would have been laughable. Yet now BMW's purchase of Rover looks like a very smart deal. The Bavarian carmaker gets the four-wheel drive technology it lacks and the most famous off-road brand name in the world. Once Land and Range Rovers start selling through BMW's North American dealerships, the volumes generated should test the capacity of the Solihull plant. While the main Rover and BMW brands will be managed separately, savings in buying and development and the sharing of overheads in the distribution network should make Rover very attractive. From British Aerospace's standpoint, the Pounds 800m sale price is higher than could have been achieved through a flotation. It also frees Pounds 900m of working capital which gives BAe plenty of options. The stronger balance sheet reinforces its position as a prime contractor in defence. Writing off around Pounds 200m of leases on its turbo-prop aircraft seems now almost certain, which will in turn will make it easier to find a joint venture partner for the business. Talks with Fokker on merging regional jet businesses could also get under way. Rationalisation of the defence business to increase margins - so far not even mooted - becomes possible. But for all the increased flexibility, did BAe get full value for Rover? The price of around 0.2 times sales is in line with the quoted price of many large carmakers, but no premium is being paid for control. Perhaps BAe might have kept a minority equity stake to get the benefit of any success Rover and BMW enjoy. Still, the certainty of a deal done is worth a lot, as Vickers found out when it tried and failed to sell Rolls-Royce Motors. BAe's new management has made good use of the opportunities it has found for itself, so the flexibility should not be squandered. And at last we know why Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman, decided to stay on at BAe for six months before taking the helm at Lucas in April.   Companies:-  Rover Group.

0,FT941-8822 ,"FT941-8822 _AN-EBRCXAH5FT 940217   FT  17 FEB 94 / BMW expects to regain ground      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and JOHN GRIFFITHS      FRANKFURT, LONDON   BMW, the German carmaker, expects to boost its profits by 20-30 per cent this year, recovering much of the ground lost in 1993 when net profits slumped to about DM510m. The company, which plans to take control of Rover Group, yesterday forecast a 5 per cent increase in deliveries of BMW models, and said income from the British business could increase earnings even further. The buoyant predictions came as teams from BMW and Rover Group were understood to be preparing to fly to Tokyo for talks early next week with Rover's long-standing partner, Honda, on BMW's intended acquisition. The teams are expected to be led by Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chairman, and Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive. Honda has a 20 per cent stake in Rover and has made plain its anger and dismay over the Pounds 800m (Dollars 1.2bn) sale to BMW by British Aerospace of its 80 per cent stake in Rover. The Japanese carmaker has indicated that its quarrel is not with Rover or BMW but with BAe. Both European parties hope to persuade Honda not to withdraw from its collaboration with Rover and point to benefits in long-term tripartite co-operation. Earlier this week Mr Pischetsrieder promised 'considerably higher' investment in Rover than had been planned by BAe. Yesterday, he vigorously denied rumours that BMW planned to reduce the Rover product range. He also repeated pledges that the British business would be run as an independent operation, adding that aggregate sales of DM40bn (Dollars 22.7bn) and the expected profits would offer job security at both companies. Mr Pischetsrieder based his optimism for 1994 profits on new models due on the market this year, economic recovery in Europe and accelerating demand in the US. A compact, two-door version of the successful 3-Series, launched this week, was expected to bolster turnover. Further impetus would come from the new 7-Series. He said the greatest uncertainty stemmed from unforeseeable exchange rate variations, but the board was 'well satisfied' with the situation.

The field trial, preparations for which began back at the  beginning of 1994 [as published], will be based on the Greven  mail center near Muenster in Westphalia. The large-scale trial  grew out of studies by the postal service as to how part of its  diesel vehicle fleet could be replaced by propulsion systems  that caused less pollution. A novel zinc-air power system  emerged as a promising prospect, although it is not without its  expert critics as regards the overall ecobalance.    However, initial tests, involving outside inspectors, on the  new power system installed in a trial vehicle went off  successfully at the TUeV [Technical Monitoring Board] for  Bavaria and Saxony, its power and output values, which far  exceeded those of conventional batteries, and its ecological  acceptability proving particularly attractive.    Autonomy Range Considerably Extended    The trials centered on use in the postal service, where  requirements are three or four times higher than in the private  transport sector. Whereas electric vehicles with an accumulator  weight of 350 kg have had a range of about 40 km to date, the  new technology permits journeys of at least 300 km.    The large-scale field trials scheduled to begin in 1995 will  set out primarily to establish whether the zinc-air power system  is economically viable and what its infrastructure requirements  are. The latter is necessary because the power cells cannot be  charged like conventional storage batteries: The electrodes  have to be changed. The ""worn-out"" electrodes are subsequently  regenerated, after which they are ready for reuse. This is why  large-scale field trials can only be performed with major fleet  operators such as the postal service.    In addition to the postal service, in the role of project  leader, and Electric Fuel Limited, the inventor of the zinc-air  system, other well-known firms have agreed to take part in the  field trial. Some firms and town councils also want to  participate in the trial with parts of their own fleets.     "

Mr Dino Martinez, the man who compiled the material, destroyed during the last week in March, dispatched several other shipments at the request of Mr Lopez, former global procurement chief at GM. Mr Martinez, described yesterday as Mr Lopez's former 'handyman' at Opel, has since moved and is working for the US group in Spain. He was the GM employee referred to anonymously in a VW statement on Monday as being responsible for collating and posting 'magazines, clippings and correspondence with suppliers'. The statement did not say he was acting on Mr Lopez's instructions. These items, described by VW officials as usual, personal office contents, were shredded in the group's guest house in Wolfsburg, at Mr Lopez's suggestion, to prevent any chance of 'possibly sensitive' material being distributed inside VW, the German group has said. Mr Martinez sent similar material in early February to Mr Lopez in Detroit. VW officials said they knew nothing more, and could not comment on the fate of a further three shipments sent later by Mr Martinez, on Mr Lopez's instructions, to an address in northern Spain, Mr Lopez's birthplace. One of these, dispatched on February 22, while Mr Lopez was negotiating a contract with VW, comprised nine boxes and weighed 150kg. A further batch of 'internal' Opel papers, again at the request of Mr Lopez, was sent to the same Spanish address on March 10, the day after he signed his contract with VW. Mr Lopez and former GM colleagues, under investigation for suspected industrial espionage, theft and perjury, are alleged to have systematically plundered GM secrets in the period before they left for Volkswagen in March. Mr Lopez last Friday won full support from VW's non-executive supervisory board, which said a thorough investigation had shown no grounds for accusations of industrial espionage.

The key new appointment was that of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, snatched from arch-rival General Motors in an unseemly tug-of-war over the weekend. Net group earnings tumbled to DM147m (Pounds 62m) from DM1.1bn in 1991, and the payout was cut to DM2 on both ordinary and preference shares, compared with DM11 and DM12 respectively, the company said yesterday. Turnover on the delivery of a record 3.52m vehicles last year rose to DM85.4bn from DM76bn, adding weight to the popular view that the more cars VW sells, the less profit it makes. Mr Lopez was named as director in charge of production and purchasing with immediate effect. His was the only outside face to appear in the new management team picked by Mr Ferdinand Piech, who has been group chairman since January 1. Mr Lopez replaces Mr Gunter Hartwich, who is to leave the company and will function as an adviser, the company said. As expected, Mr Dieter Ullsperger, finance director, has lost his job. His place will be filled immediately by Mr Werner Schmidt, a hitherto low-profile director formerly in charge of overseas operations and distribution strategy. Mr Ulrich Seiffert, the research and development chief, lost his place on the parent board, but he retains his place as RD director at the Volkswagen brand subsidiary. His research responsibilities will be taken on by Mr Gunnar Larsson, promoted last month from the group's Audi subsidiary. More detailed information on the group's performance and prospects will be given at Mr Piech's first annual press conference on March 31. Mr Piech, an Austrian promoted from the leadership of Audi, warned recently that the German car industry faced its worst crisis since 1945. The company has already announced plans to shed 36,000 workers to regain competitiveness. This job-cutting programme is likely to be stepped up and run in parallel with a squeeze on suppliers masterminded by Mr Lopez.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

The call came from Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony, which owns 19.7 per cent of the troubled automotive group. Mr Lopez, with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, was called to speak at a crisis meeting of the company's non-executive supervisory board last night. Mr Schroder's press spokesman said the prime minister still assumed that affidavits from Mr Lopez, denying theft of GM secrets, were valid. If there was anything more to be said to the charges, however, it had to be said at the meeting. At the same time, Mr Piech, who was accused of damaging Germany's reputation in his attacks on General Motors, was called on by the board's four-member presidium to tell the board when he expected the company to return to profit. Doubts have grown about the validity of Mr Piech's claims that the group will break even this year. Industry analysts suggest VW will be making losses of between DM500m (Pounds 194.5m) and DM1bn. While VW continued to say Mr Lopez's job was not at risk, Mr Schroder's demands suggested the director had still not fully convinced all 20 supervisory board members. Less than two weeks ago, Mr Schroder declared full confidence in both executives as 'men of honour'. Workers' representatives from both groups yesterday warned that the 'war' between VW and Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, and focused on Mr Lopez, endangered jobs and profits. Mr Klaus Volkert, a member of the VW supervisory board, and his counterpart from Opel, Mr Rudolf Muller, yesterday called on both groups to do everything to prevent further escalation. Mr Muller asked Mr Piech to suspend Mr Lopez until the espionage case had been concluded. Mr Volkert, however, has said he should continue to work 'like the rest of us' to earn his pay.

The statement from BAe, at the time of purchase, that there was much synergy between aerospace and car manufacture ranghollow then and subsequent statements that Rover was a core business ring hollow now. All the talk about BMW investing in Rover and possible resurrection of the 'great names' from the past is probably just that. It is designed to minimise the outcry. Take Ford and Vauxhall as examples. Gradually, the engineering and design skills have been moved out of Britain and into Germany/US leavingBritain as little more than a location for low-cost assembly. The trouble with low-cost countries is that there is always another one coming up behind and companies have few qualms about shifting production elsewhere to remain competitive. Nobody is denying that the history of Rover/BLMC/BL/BMC is littered withmistakes and gross negligence, nor that much remains to be done (three of its models - the 800, the 200/400 and the Metro - are overdue for replacement). Nevertheless, Rover appears to be sound and worthy of further investment. That it should be starved of such investment by BAe shows up the latter's problems more than it does Rover's. I make no apology for saying that Rover should remain underBritish control. Once again, the failings of this administration and of the City are shown up. The mindless pursuit of short-term profit and cash to satisfy the latest five-year corporate plan and 'vision/mission statement' is distinctly at odds with managing for the long term. It is left to the Germans, the French and the south-east Asians not only to have a long-term vision but to holdto that vision and to ensure that, come the end-game, they will be around. Regrettably, Britain will not be and I despair of our prospects. S W de Looze, 2 Gables Close, Gerrards Cross, Bucks SL9 0PR   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In an interview to be published today, he hinted that the company could be forced to sacrifice Mr Lopez. It was legitimate to ask how long a company could put up with a continuous barrage of unconfirmed suspicions, he told Die Zeit, the weekly newspaper. Asked if VW was prepared to tolerate a long legal battle with GM and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel, Mr Liesen said the supervisory board, which has hiring and firing powers over executive directors, had to retain its freedom of action. This, he said, meant 'that within the limits of our authority we apply those measures which are in the interests of the company'. Mr Liesen repeated that he stood behind Mr Lopez, under investigation for alleged industrial espionage and theft of secrets from Adam Opel. Internal VW investigations contradicted media claims that Opel data had been stored in VW computers. He told Die Zeit that the supervisory board's vote of confidence in Mr Lopez and the former GM employees who came to VW with him was based on their statements, some in the form of sworn testimony. 'Can anyone expect a company to make personnel decisions damaging to itself although allegations against it cannot be proved?' he asked. The loss of the Spanish cost-cutter, who left GM last March, would be a handicap for VW, particularly in its efforts to restructure production, he said. Mr Liesen accepted that no manager was irreplaceable, although he stressed he was not suggesting resignation. The shift in Mr Liesen's position - he has hitherto been one of Mr Lopez's stoutest defenders - suggests a reaction to the widespread conviction in the German business community that Mr Lopez must go if damage to VW's reputation is to be contained and its prospects of recovery protected.

The 43-year-old marketing specialist has clashed on several occasions with his predecessor, Mr Ferdinand Piech, the controversial VW group chairman. His place is expected to be filled by Mr Herbert Demel, development chief, who will act as 'spokesman' for the Audi board, but not as chairman. This is likely to lead to more direct control by Mr Piech. Mr Kortum's removal may also lead to further turmoil in the VW group, already racked by unexpected losses last year of DM2.3bn (Pounds 870m), and striving to reach break-even in 1994. Meanwhile suspicions of theft and industrial espionage in the wake of the appointment of General Motors' former global purchasing chief, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who joined last March, remain. Mr Kortum's first set-to with Mr Piech occurred before his appointment, when he rejected the 'spokesman' role and insisted on taking full control. The conflict leading to his downfall has focused on the autocratic group chairman's demands that Audi, which made a pre-tax loss of more than DM200m in 1993, must be turned round this year. Mr Kortum has frequently appeared unwilling to bend to his chief, who has swept away swathes of the old VW management within his first year. The most recent departure was that of Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, chairman of the Spanish subsidiary, Seat, who was sacked last September. Mr Piech last month accused Mr Daz of deception over Seat's DM1.4bn losses in 1993, and warned of possible 'penal consequences'. Others to go included Mr Daniel Goedevert, the respected VW group deputy chairman, replaced by Mr Lopez. The group purchasing chief was replaced by Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez, formerly Mr Lopez's closest associate at GM. Meanwhile, Volkswagen yesterday withdrew a claim made on Wednesday quoting a Frankfurt judge as saying charges that General Motors secret documents had come into VW's possession 'could not be proved'.

The rise was much smaller than in 1991 and 1992 when the group, known best for its Swatch watches, recorded rises of 32 per cent and 64 per cent respectively. Sales last year were flat at SFr2.86bn. The group described the results as 'favourable' and said they were achieved in spite of currency losses and largely unchanged end-user prices in soft currency countries. The directors propose to increase dividends from 18 per cent of par value to 20 per cent. Shares in SMH, which revived the Swiss watch industry in the early 1980s, have been highly volatile recently as investors worried that the growth potential of the watch business and other ventures, such as Swatch telephones, was fading. Also, the withdrawal in December of Mr Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss financier, from the group that holds the controlling shareholding in SMH, unnerved investors. For a long time, there has also been uncertainty about the so-called 'Swatchmobile' project. Mr Nicolas Hayek, SMH chairman, had long talked about launching a revolutionary small, environmentally friendly car that SMH had developed. Prior to reviving SMH, he spent most of his time as an independent consultant to the automotive industry. He saw the car as an 'emotional product,' much like a watch, and felt that his experiences of both the car and watch industries qualified him to make it a success. However, an attempt to form an alliance with Volkswagen to build the car collapsed last year. Mr Hayek has kept details of the project secret, but according to various reports, the Swatchmobile will be 2.8 metres long and have an aluminium body and a hybrid petrol and electric engine. News of the venture with Mercedes has pushed up SMH shares. In the past two sessions, the bearer shares have gained 8 per cent to SFr1,004.

His comments yesterday fuelled speculation that the criminal probe is entering a decisive phase. Further witnesses have been interrogated, while evidence from 'top-class and important' witnesses from Volkswagen has yielded nothing to persuade investigators to call off the probe, Mr Seifert said. The investigation is believed to have focused in recent days on reports that 11 VW trainees were instructed to punch GM and Opel data into the German group's computers at the end of March. 'Naturally we are following this trail,' Mr Seifert said. Opel asked for the launch of a criminal inquiry in late April, following the defection from General Motors to VW of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's global purchasing director, and several colleagues. Opel supported its suspicions with affidavits relating to missing secret data. Volkswagen claims that no secret information has made its way into the group's possession, although it admitted earlier this month that 'possible confidential' material had been destroyed on company property. Mr Georg Nauth, official spokesman for the investigating team, said investigations so far had confirmed testimony from Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors. This included findings made since an official statement, made on July 22, linked Mr Lopez and his associates with confidential data found in a Wiesbaden house. However, Mr Nauth denied press reports that investigators had established 'without doubt' that the VW trainees had copied Opel secrets into the VW database. Mr Nauth refused to name any VW witnesses, although he said Mr Lopez and three associates under investigation had not been interviewed yet. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, had not been called 'because he is not a suspect', he added. The 'top-class' witnesses referred to by Mr Seifert are known to include Mr Daniel Goeudevert, a former VW director, and Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the group's board of supervisors, who are also not among the suspects.

Do you believe that the camera never lies? Or is a photograph the most dangerous medium of all, apparently a straightforward image but one in fact selected and determined by the photographer's frame of cultural reference, and, as it is reproduced, consciously or unconsciously encouraging a social or ideological stance? Two exceptional new books on the history of photography address this question from different, but equally fascinating, backgrounds. Anthropology and Photography traces the creation and use of photographs in early British anthropology, and is worth buying purely for its abundant 19th century photographs of Fijian cannibals, Hiawatha-style chiefs, Congo dancers and the rest. But its point is our changing evaluation of these photographs, which at the time were seen as objective documentation of inferior, exotic races but now demonstrate the prejudice and cultural conditioning of the age. So a soft-focus Samoan woman from the 1890s, her naked breasts garlanded with flowers, is a classic western male erotic fantasy not worlds away from Sarah Bernhardt on stage. South Sea Islands youths with limed blond hair and huge earrings are captioned 'dandies'. Saddest are six Batwa pygmies, kidnapped in central Africa, exhibited 'live' at the Hippodrome with 17 polar bears and some Scottish dancers, and so famous that they were invited to the House of Commons. The photograph of them dressed in children's sailor suits taking tea on the terrace with MPs is a giveaway of the 1900s anthropological belief that 'primitives' were in the 'childhood of mankind' stage. 'What did they think of the greatest Legislature in the world? What dim conception did they form of its purpose and work?' asked the photographer Benjamin Stone. It is through such anecdotes, or case studies, that this book builds up a cumulative picture of the worldview that made colonial domination possible. In the Andaman Islands, an officer fascinated by 'junglees' ('wayward but attractive children') took stereotyped photos like 'Andamanese Shooting, Dancing, Sleeping and Greeting'. They were sent home doctored - for example bunches of grass were scratched on to the plate of a naked chief and his wife, both smoking pipes. Symbolic emasculation, but the photos helped the army learn more about the Andamanese, and its policy of subjugation worked: a final photo shows a dance celebrating Edward Vll as Emperor of India. The interpretation of photographs in this book also tells anthropology's own story, from its start as an unreflective, patronising study of 'primitive' people to a self-conscious discipline examining meaning in any society. Several decades on, W Eugene Smith and the Photographic Essay is an account of the camera as political and social advocate, seen through the work of Life magazine's most famous photographer. Eugene Smith took shots for the human interest photo-essays that made Life a mass circulation, high-quality magazine. But he was also an absolutist and a driven man, formed by the Depression, when his bankrupt father killed himself, and by the moralism of his Catholic convert mother. As a war photographer, he switched from warmonger (he wrote home about a knife 'good for Japs, underbrush or steak') to pacifist whose photos were so unrelenting about the human cost of war that the Pentagon censored them. At Life, as photo-essays like 'Country Doctor' and 'Spanish Village' show, he had a mission precisely of his time: to portray and improve life for the ordinary poor through a new type of intimate, immediate picture which showed everyday peopke working, eating, getting ill, giving birth. But did he really photograph Everyman? With carethis book examines the genesis of specific photo-essays, from choice of topic through research to the selection of strongly interpretative images from a 2,000-negative contact sheet. The result was benign propaganda, finding the 'perfect' American example: the young and photogenic country doctor, his stoop, look, gesture implying exactly the mix of hard work, poverty, committed satisfaction; the Main Street, Anytown, setting which must also be picturesque (Kremmling beneath the Rocky Mountains was chosen). For Smith, the triumph was to portray a secular saint; for Life, to tell a human story with a topical health care angle; for 'Amerika', Life's Russian translation, to advertise, by cropping and centering and magnifying, the great American dream. Gradually Smith's political mission clashed with Life's - in 'Spanish Village' he wanted to stop US aid for Franco - and he resigned, had breakdowns, died at 59 with Dollars 18 in the bank. But anyone interested in the social outlook that saw the rise and fall of 'Everyman' magazines like Life and Picture Post, and in the history of photographic journalism and how newspapers manipulate material, will enjoy this account of his life and work. As Smith realised, the visual image is becoming our dominant mode of communication. But one reason it is so powerful is that most of us don't have the visual grammar to respond to it in the sophisticated way with which we dissect and interpret words. Both these elegant volumes are compelling and topical attempts to change that.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2731  Book Publishing.   Types:-  TECH  Products.

Even telephone calls to Ms Dorothea Holland, the senior prosecutor in charge, had failed to produce a summons, Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs, VW spokesman said yesterday. He was responding to charges from General Motors that VW was not co-operating fully with the probe into suspicions that Mr Lopez and colleagues stole secrets from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, and took them to their new employer. A claim from Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, that VW was paying only 'lip service' to co-operation was 'unbelievable', Mr Wachs said. Mr Lopez offered personally to testify on August 26, when Ms Holland and her team searched VW's headquarters for possible evidence to support suspicions of industrial espionage, he added. During the raid Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, sent an electronic mail message welcoming the search and asking all employees to co-operate 'constructively and openly'. Mr Hughes could not be reached yesterday, but GM officials said Mr Lopez's offers were 'tactical manoeuvres'. Ms Holland was more likely to be interested in examining the haul from her search and preparing questions based on the results than seeing him now. Under German law a suspect may, at the prosecutor's discretion, see files on the investigation at the time they are questioned. They are guaranteed access when charges are imminent to allow them to prepare a public statement. According to an internal VW letter, signed by Mr Piech, the searchers confiscated documents, 25 personal computers and around 250 diskettes. People in the areas searched said the material was VW data, the letter added. 'We have, as far as we were able to attend the search action, been able to establish no indications that any secret data originating from GM/Opel was found by the investigating authorities.' Mr Hans Gab, vice-president of GM Europe, reached last night, noted VW had already admitted 'potentially significant evidence' had been destroyed on its premises.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

However, series production is sill far away.    The principle is easily understood: The conventional  combustion engine is engaged for driving under conditions where  it operates optimally in terms of fuel consumption and  environmental protection, and at the same time will charge the  battery. The electric motor is engaged when the combustion  engine would run at a low efficiency and thus harmfully to the  environment. This is the case when only little driving power is  required as, for instance, in city traffic or in a stop-and-go  situation particularly often encountered in the inner city,  where emission of pollutants and noise needs to be avoided.    This idea is not new, but there are still stumbling blocks  along the way to its practical realization. The optimum  configuration is being sought. In order to approach this goal,  the German Research Association has established a new special  research program, ""Autonomous Hybrid Drive Set,"" at the  Technical University in Munich.    ""By a simulation process we want to develop a model and with  that configuration then build a prototype,"" explains Prof Dr  Bernd-Robert Hoehn. ""Conventional drive components must be  optimized for this special application. Stepless transmissions  and regulators must be designed from scratch and tested. These  components will, however, be usable not only in a future hybrid  vehicle but also in conventional ones and in electric ones as  well.""    The concept of an autonomous hybrid is explained by the  basic  diagram on page 20 [shown below]: The axle is driven by either  the combustion engine or the electric machine operating as a  motor, through a common stepless mechanical transmission  featuring a wide range of speed ratios. When operating as a  motor the electric machine draws energy from the battery, in  turn charging the battery when it operates as a generator during  light-load or slow-traffic conditions while the combustion  engine is engaged. Boosting the battery charge is possible but  not required during normal operation. An appropriately designed  transmission makes it feasible to engage the combustion engine  throughout its most fuel-favorable operating range and outside  this range to use a high-speed and thus light-weight electric  machine delivering full power over a wide speed range.         Figure      Further advantages are:    1. Use of smaller combustion engines is made feasible by  higher start-up transmission ratios.    2. Use of smaller and lighter batteries is made feasible by  autonomous recharging.    3. There is no need for a lighting generator and a starter.    4. The fuel saving in the ECE cycle is about 40 percent and  emission of pollutants can be drastically minimized.    5. Noise emission is reduced owing to lower engine speed and  wide overdrive range.    Among electric motors for hybrid vehicles, permanent-magnet  (PM) motors have recently been found to offer great promise. The  advantage of using them in vehicles lies in lossless maintenance  of the magnetic flux. A breakthrough in required  high-performance magnetic materials came about with the  appearance of rare-earth magnets, Sm-Co in the nineteen  seventies and Nd-Fe-B in the nineteen eighties.    ""The previously high costs pose no problem today. Thus  Nd-Fe-B magnets for mass products are now purchased at a price  also acceptable for vehicles,"" believes Prof Sture Eriksson of  the ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB) Automation and Drives [ASEA--Swedish  General Electric Co]. ""Drives with PM motors cost about 15  percent more than comparable ones with induction motors. For  that, however, in test runs they indicate an about  15-percent-longer travel range.    Both the ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB) AG and the Bayerische  Motorenwerke (BMW) AG got together with the U.S. engine  manufacturer Unique Mobility for further development of this  technology. Prototype engines were already tested in BMW's  experimental vehicles. The engine shown on page 21 [not  reproduced] is coupled through a speed reducer to a  transmissionaxle unit. The tests verify that drive systems with  PM synchronous motors, while certainly not the only candidates  for electric vehicles, are probably the high-performance ""number  one"" for this application.    Since several years ago the research departments of the  large  automobile manufacturers have already been been looking for the  ideal configuration. Electric motors were coupled to gasoline  and Diesel engines, even to gas turbines (Volvo ECC-ID 3/93,  S.38/39). All designs to date have one thing in common: they are  by far not ready for mass production. Thus even the second  generation of the BMW E1 will not likely be produced in its  present form, if at all. Also the Mitsubishi people have crammed  so many innovations into its first hybrid research vehicle ESR  (Ecological Science Research) that their study of it just shows  what would be technically feasible if only the production cost  could be to a reasonable level. The ESR concept is based on the  series hybrid system, which means an exclusively electric drive.  The four-cylinder tandem gasoline engine with 1.5-liter-capacity  has a turbogenerator. Fuel is supposed to spare also the  mufflerless exhaust system, electronically controlled  counternoise compensating the exhaust noise. Body structure  along with exterior and interior designs are setting standards.    Closer to practical implementation is the Ford design. Its  drive consists of a 1,2-1 2-stroke 3-cylinder engine (60 kW = 82  hp), an electric induction motor (40 kW = 54 hp), and a Ni-Cd  battery (40 kW, 7 kWh) weighing 200 kg. When mounted in an  Escort Turnier, the system accelerates from standstill to 100  km/h within 10.9 s and in the electric drive mode to 50 km/h  within 6.8 s. Driving at speeds up to 65 km/h is emission-free,  the combustion engine automatically cutting in for higher  speeds. Both sets together provide a power of 100 kW.    The questions remain as to whether there is at all a demand  for such cars and how much they would cost. The results of a  survey commissioned by Opel and covering 3000 car drivers  indicate that 95 percent would buy a hybrid vehicle and 45  percent would pay 20,000 German marks for it. A top speed of 100  km/h satisfies 55 percent and a 200-km-long travel distance  without recharging is adequate for 48 percent of them. These are  interesting data to be included in the specification sheets for  engineers.     "

Some Dollars 101m of the award took the form of punitive damages, levied as punishment on the company, while Dollars 4.25m was awarded for the life of the youth. GM said the verdict was incorrect and it intended to appeal. The case is part of a major controversy over the safety of certain of GM's full-sized pick-up trucks. Critics claim that vehicles built between 1973 and 1987 are firetraps because the fuel tanks are side-mounted, outside the frame of the vehicle, and are likely to catch fire in side-impact collisions. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against GM over truck accidents and last month Federal regulators opened an inquiry into the safety of the vehicles. GM insists the trucks are safe, but if the regulators decide otherwise it could mean the recall of some 4.7m trucks, at a cost to the company of millions of dollars. The Atlanta case, which could encourage further costly legal action against the company, gained celebrity status when a former GM engineer, who had previously testified on behalf of the car company, took the witness stand and alleged that GM had known for years that the trucks were firetraps. GM said after the verdict that it was confident the inquiry by federal regulators would bear out its contention that its trucks were safe. It was not surprising that 'jurors sometimes can look past the complicated technical facts and judge large companies on an emotional level in sympathy with the plaintiff'. GM said it did not intend to order a recall of its pick-up trucks. General Motors yesterday stepped up its aggressive marketing of MasterCard credit cards by launching a gold GM MasterCard, writes Alan Friedman in New York.

Opel won a temporary injunction in a Frankfurt court yesterday barring its loss-making competitor from 'systematically recruiting or attempting to recruit Opel and General Motors employees'. The order, issued by three judges, followed Thursday's public accusations from Opel that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former head of GM's worldwide purchasing operation who joined VW last month, had been directly involved in a systematic attempt to 'poach' more than 40 of Opel's German procurement managers by offering to double their salaries. The injunction threatened VW with fines of up to DM500,000 (Dollars 315,000) and Mr Lopez with up to six months' jail. A spokesman for VW could not comment last night because the order had not yet been received. But the company had been advised it had 'acted legally', he said. Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, said last night he had resorted to legal remedies because his company needed to be protected. 'It was difficult to decide whether to demand that they stop, or to simply protect ourselves,' he added. 'Had he (Mr Lopez) got all the people he called here, he would have hurt us really badly,' Mr Herman said. VW's tactics, understood already to have attracted almost 20 people from Opel and from GM in Detroit in three months, are threatening the industry's usually close inter-company relationships as car makers face a 10 per cent fall in Europe-wide demand and 20 per cent fall in Germany. Mr Herman wrote earlier this week to all German motor makers, politicians and the industry association protesting about VW's actions. 'How can I sit there with Mr Piech (the VW chairman) when he is trying to destroy my company from within?' he asked. VW, which earlier this week announced a DM1.25bn first-quarter loss, hired Mr Lopez from GM to use his renowned skills as a procurement director in a bid to imitate Opel's successful cost-cutting programme.

These are the ones that somewhere along the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth. WATCHES come in all shades of geometry - round, oval, square, oblong, even the Daliesque squashed ellipse of the Cartier 'crash' watch. Yet at the 250-year-old company of Blancpain, watches have always been round. The shape is the most obvious statement of Blancpain's claim to be perhaps the most traditional of all the great Swiss watch makers. Its timepieces are also always mechanical. 'Quartz' is a word never heard at their workshop in the Jura mountains. All this makes a Blancpain essential for the self-assured businessman who abhors designer labels but whose discreet brand of anonymity marks him out as surely as a screaming logo. But even the greatest traditionalist must reconcile himself to modern technology in the interest of accuracy. Even Blancpain's longest-serving craftsmen acquaint themselves with the latest methods and materials. A small factory makes, from the most high-tech materials, components for what passes at Blancpain as a mass-produced model - although even this is hand-assembled. This watch, costing more than Pounds 2,000, makes up most of the tiny annual output of 7,000 watches a year, but it is the company's recent mould-breaking horological masterpieces that have established its reputation and attracted clients such as former King Constantine of Greece. Blancpain's latest venture may seem out of character but it allies craft and tradition to a clever marketing ploy. The company has revived the lost art of the erotic watch. An erotic design is engraved or enamelled, with the mechanics for the - er - moving parts housed in the slim case with the watch movement. All this activity takes place on the watch's reverse. The face it presents to the world is Blancpain's usual discreet roundel.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P314  Footwear, Ex Rubber.     P2323 Men's and Boys' Neckwear.

'We are now in a period of analysis. We should be able to have a very clear picture by 1995,' he announced. 'I am confident that we will have this dream plant.' The project for a plant in his Basque homeland had been proposed to SEAT, VW's Spanish subsidiary, by a consortium including the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the Banco Central Hispano, the Mondragon industrial co-operative, and Iberdrola, Spain's biggest electricity utility. He shrugged off warnings from General Motors, his former employers, that further legal action may follow if VW went ahead with the project, which seems closely modelled on an idea he and his colleagues generated while with the US group. 'We live in a free continent, and we are all free to develop ideas and make goods which we consider best for markets. We will do so if we want and no one can tell us otherwise.' The Spanish consortium is believed to have offered to build a factory with capacity for up to 200,000 cars a year in Amorebieta, near Bilbao, to be operated by VW and bought from the consortium at some unspecified date. While Mr Lopez suggested in answer to questions that this was his ideal project, a separate written statement, attributed to Mr Lopez, said VW wanted only a 'production laboratory' on a greenfield site to test revolutionary assembly methods under real operating conditions. While Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, recently confirmed that the company needed a cheap, bottom-end model in its range, Volkswagen will face severe political problems if it opens up significant new capacity in Spain while cutting back output in Germany. Capital investment plans for the vehicles business have been cut to around half the original planned level for this year - just DM6bn (Pounds 2.4bn). One of the main victims of the squeeze has been a new, greenfield plant in Mosel, eastern Germany. Background, Page 27   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

Positive factors, such as record low interest rates and the government's latest economic pump-priming package, were finely balanced against the constraints of continuing job reductions, the restructuring of banks' balance sheets and the recent 'excessive' strength of the yen, he said. But a gloomy report from the government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday is likely to increase pressure on the Bank of Japan for another cut in its official discount rate, from 1.75 per cent, at which it has stood for six months. The EPA's index of leading indicators, a pointer to business conditions in the next few months, fell to 36.4 per cent in December, the eighth month running for which this index has stood below the 50 per cent dividing line between growth and decline, compared with 41.7 per cent recorded in November. The index's components show conflicting trends, illustrating Mr Mieno's economic tug of war. Construction starts continued a three-month rising trend, as did business confidence among small and medium companies. New job offers rose in December for the second month running, while commodity prices picked up for the first time in 10 months. On the negative side, money supply was weak, sales of consumer durables fell for the third month running, and department store sales continued a 22-month decline. The EPA's coincident index, a barometer of present conditions, fell to 25 per cent in December, the third month in which it stood below 50 per cent. If the Bank of Japan continues to follow its usual caution on interest changes, it is likely to defer any decision until after the Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting next weekend and after the publication of its own Tankan quarterly survey of business confidence, Japan's most authoritative indicator of the short-term outlook, early next month.

Speaking as Daimler an-nounced the successful completion of its DM3bn (Pounds 1.2bn) rights issue, Mr Gerhard Liener said that in the long-term Daimler was considering making sure that its dividend was more closely related to the group's earnings. German companies are reluctant to vary dividends in line with earnings, although Daimler did cut its dividend last year, from DM13 to DM8, reflecting the group's fall into a loss of DM1.8bn under US accounting standards. Mr Liener described the rights issue, the first from a German company to incorporate a 'global offering' to international investors, as a great success, although he conceded that Daimler had not managed to increase the percentage of shares owned by US investors to 10 per cent as planned. Demand from US shareholders was very high, Mr Liener said and 53 per cent of all new shares not taken up by existing shareholders were placed in North America, raising approximately DM200m. This took the US shareholding to more than 8 per cent, from about 6.5 to 7 per cent before the issue. The rights issue followed Daimler's move last year to become the first German company to obtain a full listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The move had proved fully justified, Mr Liener said. Daimler remains the only German company to have a full listing in the US and therefore direct access to the world's largest capital market. The rights issue was launched in late June just ahead of a severe downturn in the German stock market. The shares were offered at DM640, a 20 per cent discount to the then share price. Had the issue been priced more tightly, it might have been forced to follow Mediobanca, the Italian merchant bank, and cancel, Mr Liener said. He said that Daimler's turnover was likely to exceed DM100bn this year, representing a slowdown in turnover growth from the 19 per cent advance in the first quarter of 1994.

0,FT942-14308 ,"FT942-14308 _AN-EDUD3ABBFT 940421   FT  21 APR 94 / Japanese steel giant to halve investment      By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO      TOKYO   NKK, Japan's second largest steelmaker, plans to more than halve its capital investment this year in an effort to cut costs and tide it over the recession. Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese car company, meanwhile said it was testing Korean-made steel, which is as much as 20 per cent cheaper than Japanese steel, underscoring the growing rift in the traditionally strong business ties Japanese companies have had with each other. If Mitsubishi decided to use Korean steel, it would be the first Japanese car company to do so on any scale in the domestic market. NKK said that as part of its restructuring programme it would reduce capital spending to Y63bn (Pounds 414.5m), or 52 per cent less than the Y130bn spent last year. The company, which expects to make a Y25bn loss in the year to March, is planning to reduce capital spending by March 1997 to one-third of levels seen in the past three years. The move highlights the increasingly difficult trading environment facing Japanese steelmakers, battered by falling demand at home, the strong yen and increasing competition from cheaper, foreign-made steel. The car industry provides as much as 20 per cent of overall steel demand in Japan. Earlier this month, the main steelmakers were forced to agree price cuts demanded by leading carmakers, for the first time in five years. Mitsubishi emphasised that there was no change in its policy of maintaining good relations with Japanese steelmakers. 'The high quality of Japanese cars owes much to the technology development efforts of Japanese steelmakers,' Mitsubishi said. But Japanese carmakers themselves are under extreme pressure to reduce costs. Even if Mitsubishi in the end decides against using Korean steel, the message will have been delivered - the recession has made vulnerable one link that had seemed inviolable. The US government yesterday upheld a preliminary ruling that Japanese makers of grain-oriented electrical steel have been dumping their products in the US market. If the International Trade Commission decides that the practice is hurting US business, Japanese steelmakers could face anti-dumping tariffs of up to 31.08 per cent.   Companies:-  NKK Corp.

The US said it would accept the decision, which must be taken by consensus. The EC claims that European car manufacturers are paying a disproportionate share of the three taxes - two of which penalise high fuel consumption, while the third is a luxury tax. Brussels says the total revenue of the three taxes levied in 1991 was Dollars 558m (Pounds 362m), of which Dollars 494m fell on European cars. European manufacturers paid 100 per cent of penalties under the corporate average fuel economy (Cafe) law, 80 per cent of the 'gas-guzzler' tax, and 80 per cent of the luxury tax, against a market share of just 4 per cent. The EC argues that Cafe payments in particular discriminate against European luxury car manufacturers since they are based on the sales-weighted average fuel consumption of all models produced. Thus US producers who make cars across a range of sizes, and Japanese producers who manufacture mostly small, fuel-efficient cars, do not incur penalties. The Gatt council failed to reach consensus on a demand by five Latin American banana producers for a panel to examine the EC's new banana import regime, which comes into force on July 1. The producers, whose panel request under expedited procedures was supported by other Latin American countries, the US and Australia, argue that the regime unfairly discriminates against them. However, their request was blocked by the EC, with backing by several Caribbean and African banana producers who will get preferential treatment under the new regime. The Community said it was still willing to search for a negotiated settlement to the long-running dispute. The Gatt council agreed to return to the matter later. Separately, the EC was criticised for failing to settle compensation for countries hurt by its oilseeds subsidy policies, which are not covered by last November's bilateral deal between the EC and the US. There was also renewed criticism of punitive US levies on imported steel.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.     XGZ  Europe.     XCZ  Latin America.

This emerged yesterday after the VW group board rejected a provisional proposal, presented personally by Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, Seat chairman. Mr Alvarez returned to Spain under orders to make the seriousness of the situation plain to his workers and to come back with a plan containing 'creative' rationalisation measures to restore Seat to profit, according to Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs for VW. 'They have had DM1.5bn (Pounds 608m) this year. There is no more money for Seat at Volkswagen,' he said. Seat, which is heading for a DM1.25bn loss this year, was bailed out 10 days ago in an intra-group deal under which VW 'bought' the Spanish company's Pamplona factory and financial services business in return for the DM1.5bn cash injection. Mr Alvarez's initial proposal relied too much on hopes of future increases in volume sales said Mr Hans-Peter Blechinger of VW. 'They have to be able to break even without higher volumes. The idea is to reduce the break-even level. Then if demand does grow you make more profit, he said. Mr Alvarez's suggestion that the 23,000 workforce should be cut by 5,000 in the medium term is also believed to have been rejected as insufficient. Seat officials said in Barcelona that Seat's definitive plans were not due to be presented for two or three weeks. Although incomplete, these are understood to include the closure of Seat's Zona Franca works in Barcelona, the transfer of production and some of the workforce to a new plant at Martorell and the loss of 8,000 to 9,000 jobs. One reason given for Seat's deficit this year is the high cost of buying parts from Germany priced in D-Marks with devalued pesetas, By publicising the outcome of yesterday's board meeting VW appeared to be fuelling the atmosphere of crisis around Seat. The unconventional tactics also reflected the frustration of Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, as well as his determination to drive through radical cost-cutting measures.   Companies:-  Seat.

Sergio Garcia, 33, who was assigned to the Van Nuys Division, was relieved of  duty without pay Jan. 27 and is scheduled to appear April 19 before a police  board, which could recommend that he be fired, said Cmdr.

""There is quite an  accumulation of charges . . . and if he is found guilty, severe punishment --  along the lines of firing or suspension -- is a real possibility.""    Garcia, who lives in Canyon Country, is on trial in Newhall Municipal Court on  a charge of falsely reporting a misdemeanor. That charge, which is not included  in the police case, stems from an altercation between Garcia and Jeanette Cox,  also of Canyon Country.

Sergio Garcia, 33, who was assigned to the Van Nuys Division, was relieved of  duty without pay Jan. 27 and is scheduled to appear April 19 before a police  board, which could recommend that he be fired, said Cmdr. William Booth.    ""For a police officer, these are very serious,"" Booth said. ""There is quite an  accumulation of charges . . . and if he is found guilty, severe punishment --  along the lines of firing or suspension -- is a real possibility.""    Garcia, who lives in Canyon Country, is on trial in Newhall Municipal Court on  a charge of falsely reporting a misdemeanor. That charge, which is not included  in the police case, stems from an altercation between Garcia and Jeanette Cox,  also of Canyon Country.

0,FT932-7208 ,"FT932-7208 _AN-DEYCHAEBFT 930525   FT  25 MAY 93 / Lopez denies he took General Motors papers to Volkswagen      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN'S top executives fought back publicly yesterday against a renewed legal attack from arch-rival General Motors of the US. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, whom, GM believes, took confidential documents with him when he defected from Detroit to VW last month, said the charge was 'untenable'. 'What did I bring with me? My personal knowledge and years of experience,' Mr Lopez said. 'A strong inner motivation. The will to realise quantum leaps at VW. No secret documents,' he added. 'I can only imagine that GM has been so affected by my change that it wants to damage my credibility,' he told selected journalists at a hastily-convened press conference. Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, publicly defended Mr Lopez. It was incredible that anyone should try to discredit not only his 'irreproachable professionalism' but also the image of VW itself, he said. VW was responsible for all its own technological progress and had not the slightest need to take out 'loans' from competitors. He could not discuss any other details of the legal confrontation because he had not yet seen the text of the charges. The press conference, in Braunschweig, near Hannover, was called after General Motors announced on Friday that it had filed legal complaints in Darmstadt, near Frankfurt, after Mr Lopez quit GM to be promptly followed by seven group colleagues. VW officials said yesterday that while the seven had filed counter suits against their former employer, Mr Lopez had not yet taken legal action. Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, had earlier won a court injunction preventing VW from poaching its staff. According to Opel, Mr Lopez had targeted about 40 key purchasing and production employees. Mr Lopez, a renowned cost-cutter, joined VW after a bizarre on-off tussle, as a key member of Mr Piech's new management team brought in to restore the group's fortunes. VW lost DM1.25bn (Pounds 516m) in the first three months of this year. Mr Lopez, a Basque, claimed he had no contract at GM, and denied rumours of multi-million dollar deals with VW. 'I could earn a lot more today in the US than I get at VW,' he added.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     General Motors Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

He and Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the company's production director at the centre of the investigation, would be interrogated 'as sure as they say 'amen' in church,' the Darmstadt prosecutors' office said yesterday. But legal officials would first have to complete their examination of a haul of documents and computerised information seized from the vehicle group's Wolfsburg headquarters in a raid on August 26. The office recently suggested Mr Piech would not be called because, a spokesman said, 'he is not a suspect'. An interim report on a private probe within VW, presented to the group's supervisory board yesterday, contained 'no findings to warrant industrial espionage accusations,' the company said in a statement last night. Officials said after an all-day meeting of the board that Mr Piech and Mr Lopez would not be leaving. The investigations involving Mr Lopez and three associates, who left the General Motors group in March, are primarily concerned with suspicions of the systematic theft of secrets from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary. The supervisory board, which appoints and oversees the work of executive directors, was also told yesterday that group profits in 1993 could be adversely affected by poor performances at the Seat subsidiary in Spain and in north American and Asian-Pacific markets. However, the German parent and the group would show a profit in the third quarter after a DM1.6bn (Pounds 646m) loss in the first half. The statement issued after the board session once again showed signs of a retreat from earlier declarations that the company would break even or return to profit this year, and that Mr Lopez would remain until he had been found guilty. The supervisory board also reinstated Mr Ulrich Seiffert as main board research and development director with immediate effect. He was removed in mid-March on the same day Mr Lopez was appointed. The VW supervisory board, which appointed auditors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand on August 13 to carry out an independent probe, said yesterday it expected a full report by the end of October.

The Japanese carmaker is planning to invest CDollars 600m (Dollars 450m) to build a second assembly plant at Cambridge, Ontario, with capacity to produce 120,000 cars a year. Output at its current plant is 85,000 cars a year. The new plant, due to begin production in August 1997, will increase Toyota's capacity in North America to more than 900,000 cars and light trucks a year by 1998, and will help Toyota counter the impact of the yen's appreciation. The main model to be produced at the new plant will be the Toyota Corolla small family saloon. It is already assembled at Toyota's plant in Ontario and at the New United Motor Manufacturing (NUMMI) plant at Fremont, California, Toyota's joint venture with General Motors. A rebadged version of the Corolla produced at the NUMMI plant is sold by GM in North America. Toyota said it would cease exporting the Corolla from Japan to North America, when the new plant in Canada begins production. Toyota, the leading Japanese vehicle maker, announced recently that its production in North America was expected to rise to 790,000 vehicles in 1996, a 50 per cent increase from last year's output of 533,000. North American produced vehicles are expected to account for 60 per cent of Toyota's sales in the US and Canada in 1996 compared with 46 per cent last year. Toyota is also increasing its car exports from North America, chiefly to Japan, Taiwan and west Europe, and exports from the US and Canada are forecast to rise to 80,000 a year by 1996 from 50,000 last year. It is seeking to increase the local content of its North American produced vehicles with plans to raise engine production in the US and Canada to more than 440,000 a year in 1996 from 207,000 in 1993. Toyota said that the planned expansion in Canada would satisfy the local content requirements of the North American Free Trade Agreement allowing the cars to be shipped freely between Canada, the US and Mexico.

Institutions yesterday proposed a seven-man board to be chaired by Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, chief executive of the Swedish operations of Asea Brown Boveri, the leading European electrical engineering group. He is chairman of the Swedish Engineering Industries association and vice-chairman of the Federation of Swedish Industries. Nominations, to be proposed at a shareholders' meeting on January 19, preserve a balance between the two main power blocs in corporate Sweden, represented by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and the Wallenberg interests and by Svenska Handelsbanken. Other proposed board members include Mr Tom Hedelius, chairman of Handelsbanken, and Mr Per-Olof Ericsson, president of Sandvik, the engineering group and also a member of the Handelsbanken board. Mr Svanholm comes from the Wallenberg sphere. He is also a member of the board of Atlas Copco, the engineering group and a key Wallenberg company. He will be joined on the Volvo board by Mr Bjorn Svedberg, president of SE Banken and a board member of Wallenberg companies including Ericsson and Stora. The institutions are also proposing Mr Hakan Frisinger, a former president of both the Volvo group and of the Volvo car operations, who emerged as an outspoken opponent of the planned merger with Renault, as well as Mr Soren Gyll, president of Volvo. The board will be completed by Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault - the biggest single shareholder in Volvo with 10 per cent of the votes. Mr Schweitzer was one of the architects of the failed merger, along with Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, and is the only foreigner proposed. Under the leadership of Mr Gyllenhammar, Volvo had fought hard to remain apart from the Swedish financial establishment and to maintain its independence from single-owner groups. Institutions, which have more than 40 per cent of the votes, are seeking to bring the carmaker into the mainstream of the Swedish corporate and financial establishment.

The Consumer Price Index for July rose at an annualised rate of 8.2 per cent, up from 7.5 per cent in June and a full percentage point above the 21-year low reached in April of 7.1 per cent. In response, rates on the government's benchmark R150 bond rose to 17.05 per cent yesterday, before dropping back to finish the day at 16.76 per cent. Bond yields, which hit a low of 11.6 per cent in January, have been rising steadily since the April elections and have soared over the past few weeks, fuelled largely by fears of higher inflation and a lack of faith in government promises of fiscal restraint. Economists say the recent rise in the bond market could add between R1bn and R1.5bn (Dollars 280m-Dollars 420m) to the government's interest bill, which already accounts for some 17 per cent of the budget. Also contributing to the bear market is continuing uncertainty over the future of South Africa's two-tier currency. Government and monetary officials are committed to scrapping the financial rand investment currency, a move almost certain to send short-term interest rates rocketing, but have given no timetable for the move. Thus, the currency and bond markets are prey to continued activity by speculators trying to second-guess the financial authorities. In recent days, fears over the state of President Mandela's health and worries that South Africa's international credit rating, soon to be announced by the major agencies, will be lower than the anticipated BBB have also contributed to the run. An estimated 25,000 workers in the car-making industry, taking part in the longest and costliest stoppage since President Mandela came to power in May, rejected the employers' revised pay offer of 10.5 per cent, their union leader announced yesterday. By the end of last week, the strike by the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa had cost the industry more than R2.2bn in turnover, an official of the Automobile Manufacturers Employers' Organisation said.

Plans to lift annual sales to 16,000, from just over 4,000 last year, depend heavily on the success of the Land Rover Discovery model, which is to be launched in North America early next year. Currently, dealers are selling only the luxury Range Rover and high specification versions of the utility Land Rover Defender. The company, part of the British Aerospace-owned Rover Group, is calling for a substantial structural change in the dealer network to cope with the expansion. Mr David Schworm, vice-president, has told dealers by letter that Land Rover wants as many as possible to drop their practice of selling its products alongside other luxury vehicle franchises - known as 'dualling' - and set up large outlets selling exclusively Land Rover's vehicles. These 'Land Rover Centres', of which the company would like about 30, would have sales territories covering many square miles and would operate 'satellite' showrooms under the same ownership. The concept, aimed at preventing Land Rover dealers from having to compete against each other, has been pioneered - with considerable success - in North America by General Motors' Saturn subsidiary. However, Saturn is a volume franchise. Dealers in other more up-market makes have traditionally resisted their manufacturers' pressure for exclusive outlets, arguing that they do not offer adequate returns. Such resistance is understood to lie at least partly behind Mazda of Japan's decision last year not to proceed with setting up a separate luxury car sales channel - Amati - at a time of economic recession. The Discovery, which is expected to sell for some Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 20,000) in the US, compared with Dollars 40,000 upwards for the Range Rover, is expected rapidly to take the lion's share of Land Rover's intended 16,000 total annual sales in North America. Earlier this month it was announced that Honda, which has a 20 per cent shareholding in Rover, was to sell the Discovery under its own badge in Japan, where it will be known as the Honda Crossroad.

The VW brand operations accounted for around two-thirds of group turnover and were already operating close to break-even in April and May, Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW group management board said yesterday. The Volkswagen parent company mad a loss of DM578m (Pounds 230m) in January, when the VW division was forced to implement extensive short-time working and make provisions for significant job cuts. Mr Piech said VW parent company losses had been reduced to an estimated DM325m in February and trimmed to DM40m in March. The VW division had cut 31 days of production in the first half of this year, but was reducing vehicle stocks. Mr Piech said he was hopeful of resuming full production after the summer. He saw no reason to change his earlier forecast that the group would achieve a small profit for the full year despite its DM1.25bn first-quarter loss. Mr Piech said the first signs were appearing of a fragile recovery in demand in the German new car market. Prices were improving in the used car market and new orders had risen over the past three weeks. Mr Piech said Volkswagen had failed 'to prepare for bad times' in the previous eight years of rising car sales in Europe. 'We came into this crisis needing to produce at 100 per cent of capacity just to break even, depending on the plant,' he said. He added the company's goal was to reduce the break-even level to '70 per cent of capacity or better,' but it could take six years to achieve this target. The 'drastic measures' taken since January had reduced the break-even level to 85-90 per cent, but the company was still only using around 78 per cent of its available capacity. 'My first task is to get into the black by the end of the year even with this level of capacity utilisation, to bring the break-even down from 100 per cent to under 80 per cent,' he said.

Although the number of drivers is expected to grow customers' attitudes to car purchases have changed significantly during the recession. The report says drivers are now accepting lower status or second-hand cars, and waiting 15 per cent longer before buying a new car. 'Customers are cannier now,' said Mr Jon Francis, of the Henley Institute, which carried out the study for the car retailing and leasing company Lex Service. He said that in addition to the impact of the recession, improvements in car manufacturing had allowed drivers to use their cars for longer. The report predicts that car sales will increase by 10 per cent this year and grow from 1.59m in 1992 to more than 2m by 1997 - about 250,000 below the 1989 level. Barring any significant tax changes, the company car market is expected to grow by 27 per cent in the next five years, with a 3 per cent fall in the number of sales representatives but growth in the proportion of skilled managers. At the same time the proportion of women company drivers is expected to grow by 9 per cent to 37 per cent by 2000, prompting shifts in marketing and servicing styles. The report predicts that Britain's drivers will own an extra 1.4m cars by 1994, as increasing numbers of people pass their driving tests and car-based jobs become more prevalent. But the report also notes, that with customers expected to buy more second-hand cars, prices in the used-car market could fluctuate rapidly  - although the late 1980s boom has created a glut of four-to-six-year-old cars, the recession has also sharply reduced the number of one-to-three-year-old cars available. The report adds that customers will increasingly prefer to use 'brand' name outlets to service their cars. It says customers have been increasingly spurning the type of 'high status' cars that were popular during the boom of the late 1980s.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

By PHILIP HAGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SAN FRANCISCO      In a severe blow to drug testing in the workplace, the state Supreme Court on  Thursday rejected attempts by employers to force workers to submit to random  tests to detect the use of illicit substances.    The justices, in a brief order, let stand two appeals-court rulings that  declared the state constitutional right to privacy protects employees from  being dismissed solely for refusing to submit to random drug tests.    In both instances, the lower court held that the state privacy guarantee  applies not only to governmental actions but also to private employers.    In one case, a state Court of Appeal in San Francisco held that a worker in a  non-safety-related job could not be required to take such a test and upheld a  $485,042 damage award to a computer programmer who refused to provide a  company-ordered urine sample.    In the other case, a state Court of Appeal in San Bernardino allowed a chemical  firm employee to sue for wrongful dismissal after he declined to submit to an  eye-pupil reaction test to determine whether he was under the influence of  drugs. Neither ruling applied to job applicants.    The high court action, taken without dissent, makes both appellate rulings  binding on trial courts statewide. Specialists in employment law said that as a  result, employers, in order to have a legally valid program, will have to  provide more specific reasons for testing -- such as an employee's involvement  in an accident or work in a safety- or security-related job. One attorney said  the action sounded the ""death knell"" for random drug tests.    The justices' refusal to hear employer challenges to the appellate rulings came  as something of a surprise. The court, now led by a moderately conservative  majority, has proved much more receptive to business concerns than its  liberal-dominated predecessor under former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird.    Moreover, recent surveys have shown a steady growth in mandatory drug testing  imposed on both employees and job applicants. A study released last week showed  that 12.1% of a sampling of current employees in California tested positive for  drug use. In sharp contrast, only 3.5% of the workers in the 49 other states  tested positive.    Thursday's action marked the second time the justices have sidestepped an  opportunity to formally review and issue their own opinion on the volatile  drug-testing issue. Last March, the high court left intact another appellate  decision allowing drug and alcohol tests of job applicants, who, the appeals  panel found, have less reasonable expectation of privacy than regular  employees.    The high court's order Thursday was hailed as being of ""monumental importance""  by Mark S. Rudy of Oakland, attorney for Barbara A. Luck, the programmer who  successfully pursued a wrongful-termination suit against the Southern Pacific  Transportation Co.    ""This means that an employer cannot use an employee's poor performance or mere  suspicion of drug use as grounds for testing,"" Rudy said. ""There will have to  be some 'compelling interest' for the employer -- a very high legal standard --  such as an accident, a safety-related job or probable cause to believe there is  drug use.""    Henry F. Telfeian of San Francisco, a lawyer for Southern Pacific, said the  action had provided the ""the death knell"" for drug-testing programs in  California.    ""Employers are going to be extremely reluctant to institute drug testing except  where they have probable cause or consent from a worker -- and even then, such  programs may be of doubtful validity,"" Telfeian said. ""It's a bad decision by  the Supreme Court not to take up this issue. The court owed it to employers to  consider this matter.""    Richard Bradley, vice president of the 4,000-member Merchants and Manufacturers  Assn., said it appeared that employers still could impose carefully tailored  testing programs. But nonetheless, he said, he was disappointed by the high  court's refusal to review the issue.    ""This country is having a real problem determining policy on illegal drugs,""  Bradley said. ""If we want to stop people from using drugs, it seems logical to  do so in the employment situation. Most employers are not trying to be  punitive. If an employee has a drug problem, they want him to get into a  treatment program.""    In the Luck case, the appellate court said that without a proven and direct  link to safety, an employer is barred by the state constitutional right to  privacy from requiring employees to submit to drug tests. The company, the  panel said, had not shown a ""compelling interest"" that would justify an  intrusion on privacy rights.    In its appeal to the high court, Southern Pacific contended that drug testing  was a legally valid and successful device to improve workplace safety and  efficiency. The company cited a recent study estimating that 25% of the work  force aged 20 to 40 are under the influence of illegal drugs while on the job.    In the second case before the court Thursday, James Semore, a production worker  for Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp., in Trona, Calif., was fired after refusing a  pupil-reaction test.    A Superior Court judge in San Bernardino County dismissed the suit but a state  Court of Appeal reinstated it last February. The appellate court said that when  a private employee is dismissed for rejecting a random test, he may sue the  employer for violating his right to privacy.    The appeals court said that firing an employee for refusing an intrusion on  privacy rights violates the ""public policy."" Such a finding, which was not made  by the panel in the Luck case, could open the way for large damage awards  against employers.    In other action Thursday, the justices:    Unanimously reversed the conviction and death sentence of Duane Holloway, now  28, for the murders of two Sacramento sisters, Diane Pencin and Debra Cimmino,  in 1983. Holloway was entitled to a retrial, the court said, because a trial  juror, violating the judge's admonition, had read news accounts of the case.  The story at issue indicated Holloway had been on parole after attacking  another woman with a hammer. The judge had denied use of the previous  conviction as evidence because of its potentially prejudicial effect on jurors.    Agreed to review an appellate court ruling that the state Department of Motor  Vehicles had misapplied tax laws and must pay refunds to 17 million used-car  owners. Officials say the decision, unless overturned, could cost the state  $1.4 billion.    Said they would decide whether the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission  has authority to award damages for emotional distress in cases involving racial  discrimination.

0,FT934-17262 ,"FT934-17262 _AN-DJAC3AGAFT 931001   FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mercedes boon for Alabama      By MARTIN DICKSON      TUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA   MERCEDES-BENZ yesterday confirmed Alabama as the winner of a fierce contest between more than 30 US states to be the site of the company's first passenger vehicle plant outside Germany. The Dollars 300m facility, which will produce a range of four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles, is to be in the town of Vance (population 250), 12 miles east of Tuscaloosa, home of the University of Alabama, and 32 miles south of Birmingham, the state's largest city. The decision is a great economic and psychological fillip for Alabama, which has trailed other south-eastern states in attracting new investment, particularly from abroad. Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, the car and commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, said the company had decided on Tuscaloosa after investigating 170 US sites. 'Tuscaloosa provides the best combination of those factors we are seeking: a quality workforce, a strong transportation network, a university environment, business vitality and a favourable quality of life,' he said. Alabama is paying a high price to attract Mercedes-Benz. It is providing economic incentives worth Dollars 112m and is committed to spending a further Dollars 140m on infrastructure and education. Mercedes-Benz stressed that other states on its short list - North Carolina and South Carolina - had offered similar packages and that incentives had not been the decisive factor in selection. Mr Billy Joe Camp, the Alabama official who headed the drive to attract Mercedes-Benz, said a cost/benefit analysis suggested that the plant would help create 15,000 jobs in the state over the next 20 years, and bring Dollars 7bn in economic benefits. Mercedes-Benz announced last April its decision in principle to build a volume sports/utility vehicle - a new market segment for the company - in the US. The Tuscaloosa plant, to employ 1,500 people, will begin manufacturing at the start of 1997, and will make 60,000 vehicles a year, as much as half of these for export markets. Mercedes-Benz said more than 60 per cent of the components would be purchased in the US, including the transmission from Borg-Warner. Engines would be supplied from Germany. Mercedes-Benz revealed yesterday the sports/utility business, including worldwide sales, would be managed from Tuscaloosa.   Companies:-  Mercedes-Benz.

0,FT934-16932 ,"FT934-16932 _AN-DJDB4AB6FT 931004   FT  04 OCT 93 / Handcuffed Howard aims to crack the whip: As the Tories try to regain the initiative on law and order FT writers look at the crisis in the criminal justice system      By JOHN WILLMAN, ROBERT RICE and ALAN PIKE   MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, has an unenviable task when he replies to the debate on law and order at the Conservative party conference on Wednesday. He will be under intense pressure from constituency representatives to regain the ground which has been lost to the skilful campaigning of Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman. Opinion polls show that after 14 years of Tory government, public confidence in the police and criminal justice system is low. According to Mr Robert Seabrook QC, vice-chairman of the Bar, the reasons for public unease include a succession of miscarriages of justice, concern about the integrity of the police and a feeling by victims that the police are uninterested in their fate. But righting these matters will involve far-reaching changes which are unlikely to produce quick results. Take the Sheehy report on police pay and conditions. Many of the 272 recommendations in Sir Patrick's report are uncontroversial, but the introduction of fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay have produced an outcry among police. While Mr Howard may be prepared to give ground on the more controversial recommendations, the comfortable relationship between the police and the Conservative government has been weakened. Implementing even a watered-down version of Sheehy will make it harder to win police co-operation for a more effective drive on law and order. The courts are no less of a challenge. Mr Howard has on his desk the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, which produced 352 recommendations in July. Chaired by Lord Runciman, the commission was set up in 1991 after a series of well-publicised miscarriages of justice. When it reported public concern had shifted from miscarriages of justice to what was seen as the inability of the courts to convict criminals. Steps that make miscarriages of justice less likely now need to be balanced by measures to ensure that the guilty do not escape justice. However, sending more people to prison would add to Mr Howard's troubles in accommodating the growing prison population. Sentences are already increasing, according to Mr Stephen Shaw, director of the Prison Reform Trust. He said: 'The number of prisoners has been rising at 500 a month this year.' The prison population would top 50,000 by 1995, not the end of the decade as had been projected. The growth has been accelerated by the repeal in May of elements of the 1991 Criminal Justice Act that promoted the use of community-based penalties rather than custodial sentences. Mr Charles Elly, vice-president of the Law Society, said that the speed with which this had been done would be regretted. The act had been too rigid, he said, but 'the government's complete volte-face has gone too far the other way - they need to get into equilibrium'. The temptation for Mr Howard at Blackpool will undoubtedly be to announce something new to an audience hungry for action. However, his hands are tied on the Sheehy report, on which he has promised to say nothing until the government publishes its response at the end of the month. Measures to make prison regimes 'more austere' would be a risky option. The leaking of a Home Office memo in August setting out such wishes was widely blamed as a factor in the prison riot at Wymott jail in Lancashire, which caused Pounds 20m of damage. Mr Shaw said: 'The prison system is more volatile than at any time since the Strangeways riot. Officials will have advised him that if you play party politics with the prison system, you're likely to come unstuck.' Lord Williams QC, a former chairman of the Bar and Labour's legal affairs spokesman in the House of Lords, said the government needed to recognise that short-term policy responses had created even greater problems. The Dangerous Dogs Act, the Bail (Amendment) Act and the Aggravated Vehicle Taking Act to outlaw joy-riding had all been expensive white elephants. Lord Williams added that having to review the 1991 Criminal Justice Act just seven months after its introduction said it all.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       CRIMINAL JUSTICE - THE AGENDA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   COURTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice were:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- End defendant's right to choose jury trial  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Shorter sentences to those who plead guilty through formalised plea bargaining  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Disclosure of defendants' case before trial  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Closer liaison between police and Crown Prosecution Service at the investigation stage  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Continuous video recording at police stations  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- More caution about confessions but no requirement for supporting evidence  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Independent review of miscarriages of justice  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  POLICE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main recommendations of Sir Patrick Sheehy's report were:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ten-year contracts for new recruits, subsequently renewable every five years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Performance-related pay  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lower starting rates for new recruits  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ending of many overtime payments and allowances  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retirement age up from 55 to 60 and full pensions after 40 years instead of 30 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abolition of ranks of chief inspector, chief superintendent and deputy chief constable  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The home secretary also plans to change disciplinary procedures and to cut local authority representation on police authorities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   PRISONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Prison Service Agency is creating a private-sector market in prison management by increasing the number of privately run establishments to 12 - about 10 per cent of the total.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr Derek Lewis, the agency's chief executive, intends to shake up state-run prisons by:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- More day-to-day responsibility for governors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Changing work and staffing practices - possibly through more market-testing.

More stoppages are threatened. The dispute risks disrupting the launch next month of Skoda's Felicia model, its first new product since 1988. It could also rebound on VW's delicate talks with the government on increasing its stake. Skoda says the job losses, announced last month, are necessary to increase competitiveness and it has hinted at more next year. The company employs 17,000 people. Union representatives insist, however, that wages are lower and productivity higher at Skoda's Mlada Boleslav plant north of Prague than in European Union countries. Volkswagen's 31 per cent of Skoda is due to rise to 70 per cent under a 1991 agreement with the government, at a total cost of DM1.4bn. VW also agreed to invest DM8bn, but it announced last year that it would cut this to DM3.75bn after running up huge losses at its Seat subsidiary in Spain. The original investment envisaged production levels of 400,000 cars yearly at Skoda by 1997, but this is expected to be changed to about 300,000 by the end of the decade. Production has fallen steeply this year as the company's old Favorit model has been phased out and new assembly plants installed to produce the Felicia. Overall production is expected to dip to 180,000 this year from 220,000 last year, but Skoda says it should rise to 1993 levels again next year. Skoda lost Kcs4.26bn (Dollars 154m) last year on revenues of Kcs35bn, and further losses are expected again this year. Volkswagen and the government are discussing an addendum to the 1991 agreement under which the carmaker would commit itself to production, employment and investment targets. The talks are due to be completed by the end of this month. Even at its reduced level Volkswagen's investment is the biggest in the Czech Republic to date. Hostility to foreign investment is growing, however, as the Skoda investment and other high-profile deals, such as that of Air France in Czechoslovak Airlines, begin to run into problems.

The two car producers rushed to outflank each other yesterday with rival announcements claiming to be the first in the market-place with the initiatives. Cash refund schemes to dissatisfied car buyers have been pioneered in recent months in the US, including by Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, but Ford and Rover both say their UK initiatives are the first to be mounted in Europe. Rover is to offer retail customers in the UK a new vehicle or a cash refund within 30 days or 1,000 miles, if they are not satisfied with their first purchase. Ford is introducing a 'no strings' offer to both retail and fleet customers to exchange any new car or commercial vehicle within 30 days or 1,000 miles, if the customer is dissatisfied. Unlike Rover, Ford is not offering a cash refund within 30 days. Ford is offering, however, to replace a car or commercial vehicle or provide a refund within the first 12 months, if the vehicle has a 'persistent defect'. After six months, the size of the refund would be reduced to reflect the mileage driven. The Rover scheme was originally intended to be unveiled on June 15, but details were hurriedly announced last night in the wake of a Ford press conference held at only a couple of hours' notice yesterday afternoon. The Rover scheme is not open to fleet customers. The offer applies to customers who have either paid cash for their car or bought it through a credit arrangement with Rover's finance subsidiary. The pioneering initiatives from Ford and Rover reflect the growing importance of sales and marketing and the issue of customer satisfaction as the new frontier for competition between carmakers, which increasingly have managed to close the gap between each other in manufacturing efficiency and quality. Rover said it had no fears that the scheme would be abused by drivers looking for free car hire. Toyota to boost output, Page 12   Companies:-  Ford Motor.     Rover Group.

0,FT934-166 ,"FT934-166 _AN-DL3BXADAFT 931230   FT  30 DEC 93 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz plans expansion outside Germany      By DAVID WALLER      FRANKFURT   Mercedes-Benz, the automobile subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group, is to increase commercial vehicle production outside Germany. The expansion will concentrate on the south American market as well as China and Indonesia, according to Mr Bernd Gottschalk, the Mercedes-Benz board director responsible for truck production, in an interview with a German newspaper. The plan is consistent with Mercedes' decision to shift production of passenger vehicles out of the high-cost German manufacturing environment but, according to Mr Gottschalk, the purpose of the expansion is to take advantage of new market opportunities and benefit from lower costs. The share of foreign production of commercial vehicles has risen over recent decades to around 50 per cent in 1993, in stark contrast with Mercedes passenger cars, all built in Germany. This is set to change following Mercedes' decision earlier this year to build a car factory in Alabama, but this month Daimler stepped back from further foreign production when it decided to locate production of a planned small car in Germany rather than abroad. Mr Gottschalk said that Mercedes planned to start selling light commercial vehicles, in south America. The group planned to invest about Dollars 100m in new production capacity in Argentina. The new factory will be used to assemble 15,000 to 20,000 new T1N trucks each year to be sold throughout South American, operating in tandem with the group's main production site for light commercial vehicles at Dusseldorf in Germany. The T1N will come to the market in early 1995. The executive said the group intended to strengthen its presence in China, where it already plans two joint ventures to manufacture buses and is in talks with a local manufacturer over a joint venture to build engines. This could lead to production of medium-weight commercial vehicles in China, he added. Mr Gottschalk, who mentioned plans for increased production in Indonesia as well, insisted that the expansion abroad would not be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany. He said the future of domestic plants was not black, so long as restructuring plans were implemented effectively. He said that commercial vehicle turnover would drop this year by about 5 per cent from DM26.9bn in 1992, while unit sales would fall 7 per cent to 255,000.   Companies:-  Mercedes-Benz.

Mr Martin Bangemann told a Turin conference on the future of the EC car industry that the Commission would encourage training and re-training, and back technological innovation to help improve the competitiveness of the car industry. Mr Bangemann also called for the development of an EC-wide computerised road-pricing system, which would replace toll-kiosks on main European highways, and help reduce congestion and pollution. 'We do not abolish frontiers in Europe just to see ourselves forced to stop every few kilometres to pay a toll,' he said in his speech, the text of which was released in Brussels. The Commission has just submitted to member states a draft of its latest report on the state of the EC car industry. Industry ministers will discuss the study at their meeting on November 18 and Commission officials said yesterday they expected several weeks of fierce political debate about how the EC should respond to the industry's problems. A final report is likely to be adopted in early 1994. In his speech yesterday, Mr Bangemann urged the industry to invest in new plants with the aim of creating a European 'lean production' system as productive and cost-efficient as the Japanese equivalent. But he added that there would also have to be changes to the internal organisation of companies and to their relationship with outside partners, component manufacturers and the sales network. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, is in Brussels today to cajole the EC's industry and competition commissioners into agreeing plans for the future of Ekostahl, the east German steelmaker. The Treuhand privatisation agency wants Riva, the private Italian steelmaker, to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, and invest in the construction of a hot-rolling mill. But Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, is understood to be insisting on further cuts in capacity at Ekostahl to offset the addition of the new mill.

It was one of several statements from witnesses and written affidavits which contradicted claims and formal declarations from Mr Lopez, now VW's production director. According to statements by Mr Lopez, both yesterday and previously, he remembered asking for only four or five charts. GM employees yesterday also contested Mr Lopez's reasons for wanting translations into German of about 300 overhead projection slides relating to GM's future purchasing policy. A statement read by his lawyer said Mr Lopez, who was head of global purchasing at GM, needed German versions for presentations to suppliers of components to Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary. According to an affidavit from a GM employee he asked for the translations, he wanted them because of possible difficulties with the VDA, the German motor industry association, over his purchasing policy. Mr Lopez has a confirmed reputation as a hard negotiator on prices. 'It was unusual because Mr Lopez was not very good at German,' the affidavit said. The hearing in Hamburg was related to an attempt by Der Spiegel, the weekly news magazine, to remove a court gagging order imposed at VW's request. The order was imposed following the publication of articles alleging that Mr Lopez and colleagues systematically assembled company secrets while still working for GM. The reports also suggested that Mr Lopez, who abruptly joined VW in mid-March, and colleagues who followed, took the secrets with them or sent them in advance. Imposing the gagging order, the court had ordered Der Spiegel to print formal rebuttals by VW executives of most of its allegations. It also emerged yesterday that the GM legal department asked for a search of an office occupied by Mr Jose Gutierrez, a close associate of Mr Lopez, while Mr Gutierrez was away on a business trip in Japan on GM's behalf. The search, on March 17, two days after Mr Lopez quit, failed to uncover 'highly confidential' documents on a new diesel engine, which Mr Gutierrez has subsequently denied ever having.

The new plant, for which the UK is in the running, would produce the company's planned small car, Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, said yesterday. A decision on the plant, which would be able to produce about 200,000 cars a year, could be taken by the end of this year, he said. The company was aiming for a share of about 2.5 per cent of the world market for small cars, which totals about 8.5m. Mercedes-Benz is seeking to spread manufacturing of its passenger vehicles outside Germany as part of its new product strategy, although a German site for the new plant is on the shortlist of four, which includes the UK and the Czech Republic. The disclosure will trigger intense competition between countries trying to attract one of the biggest greenfield site automotive projects likely to be built in Europe in the second half of the 1990s. In recent years, the main share of new car assembly capacity in Europe has been built in the UK with the development of three plants by Nissan, Toyota and Honda, the Japanese carmakers. The European car industry is already suffering heavily from over-capacity, but Mercedes-Benz has been forced to plan a new facility to enter the small car market. Mr Werner said the plant would be dedicated to the small car. The decision to build a small car marks a sharp change of policy by the German luxury carmaker, which is also planning to expand into other new market segments, those for four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicles and multipurpose vehicles. Mr Werner said an announcement would be made around the end of this month on a location in the US for a plant to build the proposed four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicle. Mercedes-Benz planned to build up to 65,000 vehicles a year in this range for sale worldwide, but expected the plant to break even at production of less than 40,000 a year. The new MPV would be built at Mercedes-Benz's existing plant in Spain and would be launched in January 1995, Mr Werner said.   Companies:-  Mercedes-Benz.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

The shares shed another 1 per cent of their value in Frankfurt as markets reacted to Thursday's statement from prosecutors probing allegations of industrial espionage against Mr Lopez. The statement showed investigators had established a link between Mr Lopez and a cache of confidential documents belonging to General Motors, his former employer, found recently in a Wiesbaden house. VW stocks closed DM3.2 lower at DM345, while other leading German motor manufacturers gained and the Dax blue-chip index rose more than 17 points to 1830.83. Mr Lopez would probably have to go sooner or later because suspicions about his activities were harming confidence in the VW management, analysts said. However, they agreed his loss would not seriously damage VW's recovery prospects since restructuring measures were already well-established. The company's comment on Thursday that there was no reason for Mr Lopez to resign 'at present' was seen by one as a sign that the company was 'keeping the back door open'. Meanwhile, complaints from VW that the prosecutors' statement was 'one-sided' earned the company a brusque rebuff yesterday. The prosecutors' Darmstadt office described as 'incomprehensible' charges of bias on the grounds that VW had not been allowed to see four boxes of documents found in a house recently vacated by two GM employees who followed Mr Lopez to VW after he quit the US group in March. The boxes contained details of a secret new car model, future sales strategies, and, crucially, confidential information specifically requested by Mr Lopez when he still worked in the US. It also emerged that Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, yesterday met Mr Gerhard Schroder, a senior member of the group's supervisory board. Mr Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony, which owns 20 per cent of VW, has been a vociferous supporter of Mr Lopez and Mr Piech, defending them against what he claims is a 'campaign' by a 'foreign' company to damage VW. A state government spokesman said the two men would consider what conclusions could be drawn from the week's events.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

Dutch businesses which invest in electric-powered company cars are to be allowed accelerated depreciation of the vehicles under a new scheme designed to promote the use of electric cars. The pressures on the car industry to accelerate the development of electric vehicles are intensifying. Toyota and Nissan, the two leading Japanese car makers are joining forces to develop an electric car, according to Japanese newspaper reports yesterday. The newspaper Mainichi Shimbun said that Toyota and Nissan had begun talks on the development of common electric vehicle components. Japan's ministry of international trade and industry has set a target of having about 200,000 domestic electric cars in use by the year 2000. Last month the big three US car makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, announced that they planned to co-operate more closely in the development of electric vehicles. The three companies have signed an agreement to investigate co-operation in the design, development, testing and possible manufacturing of electric vehicle components which would ultimately be used in each company's own vehicles. Two years ago the US car makers also formed a consortium to carry out research and development on advanced batteries that would be capable of providing electric vehicles with significantly increased range and performance. The state of California has been at the forefront of seeking to encourage the use of electric vehicles through regulation - by 1998, 2 per cent of cars sold in California are to be so-called zero emissions vehicles. Yesterday's move by the Dutch government is one of the first inititaives in Europe to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles through the use of tax incentives. The Dutch environment ministry said that electric cars have been placed on a list of 400 environmentally-friendly products that provide tax breaks to companies which purchase them. Thanks to the move, companies will be able to set off against tax the full price of an electric-powered vehicle in the first year of purchase.

Three groups now have unveiled schemes and two more are expected to do so soon. The programmes already announced should raise imports by up to Dollars 4bn a year by 1997. They are designed to help reduce US-Japan trade tension. The voluntary measures follow sustained pressure from Washington on Japan to reduce its record trade surplus. The Japanese government has insisted it was unable to influence private sector decisions. Toyota, Japan's biggest vehicle group, said it planned to double overseas output by the end of 1996 from 890,000 vehicles in 1993. This would include doubling capacity at its US plant to 400,000 units, and lifting UK capacity from 37,000 in 1993 to 100,000 units this year. The company said it expected to increase the value of overseas parts and materials used by the group worldwide from Dollars 6.3bn in 1992 to Dollars 9.7bn by 1997. It also expected to raise the level of US parts from Dollars 4.43bn in the 1992 financial year to Dollars 6.45bn in 1996. Mitsubishi said it would reduce the number of cars made in Japan for export from 600,000 in 1993 to 550,000 in 1997. Local content of its Illinois plant would increase from about 70 per cent currently to more than 80 per cent in 1996. Last week Nissan announced it would increase purchases of US parts from Dollars 3.7bn in the year to March 1995 to Dollars 4.3bn in the year to March 1998. Similar undertakings are expected from Honda and Mazda by the end of the week. Japan will lift voluntary curbs on car exports to the US as of March 31, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said early today. It said: 'The lifting of restrictions reflects recent steady declines in the number of car exports to the US and conclusion of the Uruguay Round which decided to lift grey restrictions within four years.'

About 1,000 of the jobs will be at the main Rover plant at Longbridge, Birmingham, in vehicle assembly and engine production. A further 300 workers will be recruited at the Land Rover plant at Solihull, near Birmingham, to support rising production of the new Range Rover luxury four-wheel-drive vehicle, while 150 jobs will be added at the body and pressings plant at Swindon. The recruitment halts the long decline in the size of the workforce of Rover (formerly British Leyland), which has fallen from 41,700 in 1990 to 33,000 last year. The workforce has been cut from 96,000 in 1984. Rover, taken over by BMW in January, said recruitment of the workers would take place during the next six months. The workforce worldwide was being increased to about 35,500 to meet increases in production and future model programmes, which formed part of the group's Pounds 1.5bn, five-year investment plans. Next year Rover will replace its current 200/400 range and launch a new range of MG sports cars. Rover has added 1,300 jobs at its Land Rover Solihull plant in the past 18 months to support rising production of its Discovery four-wheel-drive vehicle. The group's retail sales in the first nine months worldwide rose by 9 per cent to 371,805 from 341,075 in the corresponding nine months last year with sales in continental Europe increasing up by 20 per cent. Its sales increased by only 3.2 per cent in the UK market, but Mr John Towers, Rover group chief executive, said the group was willing to accept a fall in its UK market share, as long as this was more than offset by rising exports in order to reduce its current heavy domestic reliance. 'I would be happy with a lower market share in the UK, so that sales and marketing can be in line with the positioning of the Rover brand rather than responding to business pressures,' he said.

The two companies have been locked in legal conflict since 1992 following GM Europe's decision to transfer production of its Opel/Vauxhall Calibra coupe from Valmet's plant at Uusikaupunki to one of its main German plants at Russelsheim, near Frankfurt from December 1992. GM moved the Finnish assembly to Germany to improve capacity utilisation at the Russelsheim plant and to avoid the added cost penalties of production in Finland. Valmet responded with a series of legal actions, which ended yesterday when GM was forced to accept a settlement, after it became clear that it was about to lose its case before an international tribunal in Paris. GM said that under the terms of the settlement all other outstanding legal disputes between the two groups had been dropped. The US carmaker has been forced to place 45 per cent of its planned production of the Calibra at the Finnish plant starting in the second quarter of this year and running to the end of 1996, when its original agreement with Valmet was due to expire. It must also pay compensation to Valmet for the 15 months from the end of 1992, during which output in Finland has been curtailed with the loss to Valmet of around 10,000 cars. The size of the damages was not disclosed. GM was forced by a German court order last year to resume small volume production in the second half of 1993 pending the outcome of the arbitration. The US carmaker said that it expected total Calibra output to reach about 27,000 this year, of which about 1,000 a month would be produced in Finland. Output of the Calibra began in Finland in March 1991 at a time when GM needed extra capacity in west Europe with record demand for new cars. Mr David Herman, chief executive of Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said that the company would incur a cost penalty of DM4,000 - DM5,000 per car for the Calibras produced in Finland.

Although he is not prepared to offer any further cash aid beyond the recent DM1.5bn (Dollars 920m) emergency injection, he will attempt to convince political leaders of an urgent need for rationalisation. Seat expects a deficit of DM1.25bn this year, and even if demand for cars improves, further substantial losses are inevitable next year without change, group officials said. The aim of the visit was to find a solution acceptable to all sides, a spokesman said last night after a VW board meeting. A company statement added that no decisions had yet been taken over the future of Seat's factories and there was no question of the company losing its independence 'as a brand within the group'. It was necessary to bring Seat up to internationally competitive standards, especially in terms of employment levels. Spanish media have charged VW with imperialism and trying to protect German jobs at the expense of Seat workers. Yesterday's newspapers carried reports that VW wanted to move key decision-making responsibilities from Spain to VW headquarters in Germany. The outcry started last week after the resignation of Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, the Seat chairman. He lost his job after being told by the VW board that his rationalisation plans, including around 5,000 job cuts, were 'too soft'. Mr Piech is due to meet leaders of national and regional governments in Madrid and Catalonia, and have further talks with union officials anxious about the future of the Seat site in the Zona Franca, Barcelona, which employs about 10,500 people. Mr Piech, who will travel with Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the group's Spanish-born production director, was yesterday warned to keep his promise that unions would be involved in decision-making. Mr Enrique Montoya, a leader of the UGT union, who met Mr Piech last Friday, said he believed the union voice would be heard. But if decisions were taken without union participation, there would be 'protests of unprecedented intensity', he added.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Sociedad Espanola de Automobiles de Turismo.

Japan's index of leading economic indicators stood at 40 in July, the third consecutive month in which it has fallen below 50, the dividing line between growth and decline. The index, published by the Economic Planning Agency as a measure of the outlook for the next six months, rose from 30.8 in June. Among the components pointing to a slight improvement, inventories of raw materials were down for the fifth month running, money supply rose for the fourth month, and new machinery orders rose for the first time in four months However, the index has recently proved an unreliable recovery indicator. It was well above 50 for the first four months of the year, so adding to groundless hopes that the downturn was near an end, said Mr Jeff Young at Salomon Brothers Asia. The yen's greater than expected rise is one reason why the downturn is more severe than many industrial companies had feared, even a few months ago. This was highlighted yesterday by a 14.7 per cent annualised decline in car exports last month. That was the fifth monthly decline running and the worst performance for 14 years, said the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Hopes of an export boom to China have been cut short, as Japanese car sales there only increased by 3.3 per cent in August, after having doubled in the previous seven months, the association said. Exports to the European Community fell 13.4 per cent and sales to the US were down 16.4 per cent in August. Further evidence emerged yesterday of the depressed state of Japanese consumer spending, one of the main factors in what is becoming the country's worst recession since the 1973 oil price shock. Sales at department stores and large retailers dropped 4.2 per cent in August from the same month the previous year, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced. This marks the fifteenth monthly fall running. However, some retailers, such as thriving discount stores, have reported signs of an upturn in September sales.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

The reshuffle brings two executives to the fore: Mr Richard 'Skip' LeFauve, head of Saturn, who has been given responsibility for all small cars in North America; and Mr Donald Hackworth, who will run the medium-sized and luxury car businesses. Mr Richard Wagoner, who became president of GM's North American operations this summer, said there were 'a lot of good ideas in Saturn that need to spread across the company', though he added that 'the flow will not be one-way'. Saturn accounts for some 300,000 of the 3m cars that GM produces in North America each year, compared with the 1m vehicles produced by its other small cars division, the Lansing Automotive Division. The company said its North American car operations would continue to be run as four separate divisions, and that it was not making any changes to its product lines. Mr Wagoner said no specific cost savings were projected as result of the shake-up. The move comes as production at the US's biggest automotive group continues to pick up after a strike at a parts plant in Michigan, which brought several production lines to a halt last week. The strike ended when GM agreed to demands from the United Auto Workers union to hire more staff at the plant to reduce the overtime load on the existing 11,000 workers. Mr Wagoner said yesterday that settlement of the dispute did not mean GM would give in to demands for extra staff at other sites. The company looked at staffing levels plant by plant, and had settled other similar issues without adding to staff levels, he said. Mr Wagoner characterised the latest strike as a symptom of expanding demand in the US, which had caused 'bottlenecks' at various points in the production and distribution chain. 'Clearly, we are hitting some rough spots,' he said. The question for the GM's management, he added, was: 'How do you manage the upside, while leaving the company prepared for any future downturn?'

The Japanese car company's long-term debt is currently rated A2 and its commercial paper is rated Prime-A. The announcement came as Nissan reported a 9 per cent fall in domestic sales for September, which was its third straight year-on-year decline, and a 26 per cent decline in exports in the first half of the fiscal year to September. The company's domestic production also declined 13 per cent in the first half, the third straight year-on-year decline, partly due to an increase in overseas production of 22 per cent. Moody's said that its review would focus on Nissan's ability to respond to the challenges posed by weakening demand in Japan and on the outlook for new model introductions by the company. The review will also examine the impact of the yen's appreciation on profitability in overseas markets and Nissan's efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency. The credit rating agency is also looking at Nissan's use of local production facilities to offset pressures of the high yen, the potential implications for the company's Japanese production facilities, the investment required to maintain competitiveness in each of its major markets and Nissan's ability to meet its investment requirements either through internally generated funds or by increasing indebtedness. Separately, Nissan announced that it is setting up a US logistics company to handle logistics operations for US-made auto parts that are exported to Nissan factories in Japan and Mexico. The new facility is scheduled to start operations in April to manage the procurement of car parts by Nissan in the US. Nissan hopes the establishment of the logistics centre will cut lead times currently required to deliver US-made parts in half. The move comes in response to growing US demands that Japanese carmakers buy more US-made car parts and comes as the US and Japan prepare to face each other in negotiations over Japanese imports of US autos and auto parts this week. Nissan has voluntarily agreed to import Dollars 3.7bn worth of US auto parts in the fiscal year to March 1995.   Companies:-  Nissan Motor.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

0,FT941-2957 ,"FT941-2957 _AN-ECRDQACKFT 940318   FT  18 MAR 94 / Truck output rise of 7% gives little cause for joy      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Statistics yesterday showing a 7 per cent year-on-year rise in commercial vehicle production in February - only the third monthly increase to be recorded since mid-1992 - brought little comfort yesterday to an industry seeking to recover from its steepest recession on record. The apparent improvement mainly reflects a sharp fall in production in the previous February, as a result of the collapse into receivership that month of the Anglo-Dutch Daf trucks and vans group. Yesterday's statistics, issued by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office, showed car production to be higher last month than a year ago, but only by 2.73 per cent. Both sectors have been affected by last year's severe slump in continental European car and commercial vehicle sales, which have shown only faint signs of revival. The statistics show that February commercial vehicle output totalled 19,557, a rise of 7.02 per cent from the previous February's 18,275. This brought output for the first two months of this year to 36,048, a decline of 2.80 per cent on the year-ago period's 37,088. Production for export last month was 15.47 per cent lower, at 8,704, compared with the previous February's 10,297. A strengthening recovery in the UK commercial vehicle market, as well as Daf's problems last year, was is reflected in output for the domestic market. It totalled 10,853 last month, a 36 per cent rise from the previous February's 7,978. Car output last month was 114,121, compared with the previous February's 111,091. Output for export was down 10.22 per cent on the previous year, at 44,188. But for the domestic market it was 13.02 per cent higher at 69,933. Sales of vans and other light commercial vehicles bought on hire purchase or other forms of finance leapt by more than half last month. Finance sales of new light commercial vehicles rose 51.2 per cent and finance sales of used commercials jumped 52.6 per cent. Statistics from HPI, the vehicle credit information organisation, show a 47.8 per cent rise in finance sales of used heavy commercial vehicles, and a rise of 22 per cent in finance sales of new heavy commercial vehicles.

'English pissed off]' said the first sentence. Bild, a splashy but effective opinion former, was one of the few German newspapers to rush to judgment after Monday's takeover announcement. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, the BMW chairman, had delivered 'a masterpiece of modern industrial policy,' it said in a leader. BMW was big, strong, successful, and had come through the auto industry crisis without a scratch. The brilliance of the deal had bathed the whole of German industry in sunshine. 'Onwards and upwards]' it concluded. In its less flamboyant way, the Frankfurt stock market also vigorously applauded the move. Following analysts' strong 'buy' recommendations, based mainly on the allegedly low price paid for Rover, BMW's shares closed DM51 (Pounds 19.40) higher yesterday at DM790 - bringing the surge since the start of Monday trading, when the news broke, to DM107. Daimler-Benz stock caught a little of the sun, too, rising DM6 to DM818 after losing DM4 the previous day. The quality press was decidedly guarded. Handelsblatt, the financial daily, was not sure that BMW's move out of its comfortable high-performance niche was altogether wise. The purchase would increase BMW's exposureto the cyclical bumps of the car market, it noted. Rover would also need continued financial support. The Suddeutsche Zeitung was puzzled that Honda letthe prize slip away. Was the real reason liquidity problems, or were the Japanese trying to push the price down? Whatever the reason, it hoped BMW did not become too cocky. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which relegated the story to the fourth page of its business section, reflected the risk-aversion common in German business. Rover was not at the peak of health, and BMW's profitability was likely to be diluted, it said. Although several papers took the opportunity to revive an old German joke about British Leyland (once known as Britisch Elend or British Misery), most delicately avoided the nationalist or emotional issues involved. True to form, Bild quoted a UK car worker as saying:'Outrageous, why did we win the war?' But Handelsblatt side-stepped the issueeven in its page one splash headline: 'The last great British car maker will be steered by foreigners in future.'   Companies:-  Bayerische Motoren Werke.

The so-called Swatchmobile has been promoted for several years by Mr Nicholas Hayek, chairman of SMH (Ste Suisse Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie), who masterminded the rescue of the Swiss watch industry in the 1980s. Prototypes have appeared hitherto as two-seater minicars with a variety of propulsion units ranging from electric to petrol and hybrid systems. The German carmaker said that co-operation with SMH held 'promising possibilities for the development, manufacture and marketing of automobiles geared particularly to city use'. The board of Daimler-Benz, the Mercedes-Benz parent company, yesterday approved its car division's plan to set up a development company with SMH. The joint venture is expected to be established next month. A similar joint venture between SMH and Volkswagen, the German volume carmaker, foundered a year ago when VW withdrew because of pressure from its sharply rising losses. Mercedes-Benz said yesterday that it had not been decided whether any car developed with SMH would be sold under the Mercedes badge, nor whether it would be sold and marketed through the existing Mercedes-Benz sales network. Mercedes-Benz's move to enter a joint venture with SMH, whose recent success has been founded on the production of low-price, high-quality watches as fashion accessories, marks another dramatic departure from its traditional area of prestige executive and luxury cars. In the past 18 months the German carmaker has embarked on a transformation of its new model development strategy, which is aimed at taking it into several new segments of the world car market, including small cars, four wheel drive sports/utility vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles. It has recently announced plans to build a small, four-passenger car at a plant in Germany with output of up to 200,000 cars a year and aimed for launch in 1997. This model, shown as a concept car, Vision A-93, at several international motor shows last year, is designed to be smaller than a Volkswagen Golf or a Ford Escort but considerably longer than the planned Swatchmobile.

The contract, which the company said yesterday would be worth 'quite a few millions' over several years, may make a decision by General Motors to sell Lotus more difficult. GM has owned Lotus since 1987. Several interested parties have approached GM about the purchase of all or parts of Group Lotus including a management team led by managing director Mr Adrian Palmer. GM has not disclosed details of any of the other approaches, which followed a decision last year to abandon production after less than two years of the Elan small sports car which Lotus had hoped to sell at a rate of 3,000 a year. The car was widely regarded as too expensive and never came close to sales targets. As a result Lotus Cars, the carmaking division which now produces only the very low volume Esprit 'supercar', has been making heavy losses for the past two years. It now employs only 200 people - one third of 1991 levels. Lotus Engineering, the consultancy division which has won the Taiwan contract, earned more than Pounds 30m in 1991 and is understood to have made substantial profits last year, although figures have yet to be released. The division is now substantially larger than the carmaking side of the business, with 500 employees. The Taiwanese deal involves technology transfer by Lotus to the Taiwan government-backed Industrial Technology Research Institute. Four Taiwanese carmakers - Yulon Motor, China Motor Corp, San Yang Industry and Yeu Tyan Machinery Manufacturing - are also taking part in the project, which aims to bring into volume production a range of 1.2 litre and 1.6 litre car engines by 1997. Taiwanese officials said the project would help to upgrade the island's car industry and reduce its reliance on imports of components from Japan. General Motors' dilemma is that while it would probably be glad to be rid of the loss-making car side of the business, GM is itself one of the biggest customers for Lotus Engineering's design and development services.

The six-hour shift, to be worked by existing employees on overtime, is intended to raise production by 5.5 per cent to 4,750 cars a week from 4,500. Rover, which is owned by German carmaker BMW, said at the weekend that the increased production is to meet higher demand in the UK and several large continental markets. It also reflects a broadening of the model range to include an estate car, the 400 Tourer, which is to go on sale next month. The Longbridge plant, which also produces the Mini, Metro and engines and gearboxes, at present makes 200s and 400s on a non-stop, 24-hour basis five days a week. Rover said that the Sunday shift would require about 1,000 of the 2,500 employees currently engaged in 200/400 assembly, all of whom had volunteered. The Sunday-working programme will continue until the annual summer holiday shutdown at the start of August, when the situation will be reassessed. Rover was the only carmaker to increase sales in western Europe's slumping car market last year. In the first quarter of this year 200/400 sales rose by 15 per cent in the UK to 23,302, and continental sales rose by a similar amount to 35,574. Rover has also increased production of its larger 600 model by 30 per cent since the start of this year to 1,110 a week from 850. Last month the four-wheel-drive subsidiary, Land Rover, announced it was creating 600 jobs through an 8 per cent output rise - following a 20 per cent production increase last year. Total west European sales of 132,000 in the first four months of this year were only 2,000 behind those of its BMW parent. The first small saloon car to be produced by Rover since it was taken over by BMW will be a model code-named R3 on a shortened Rover 200 body platform. The new model will come on to the market in autumn 1995. The ageing Metro will be given a facelift at the end of this year and the 200 series will be replaced next spring.

With its limited financial resources Rover was never able to make a business case for developing a successor for the 35-year-old Mini,but Mr Pischetsrieder is enthusiastic. 'Sure they will have the resources now,' he says, 'others can manufacture minicars but only Rover can manufacture Minis. This car has a unique position in the world outside the US. To give that away would be foolish.' He insists that the takeover of Rover is based on maintaining BMW and Rover as two separate entities, although the UK carmaker will now be able to draw on BMW's extensive engineering resources. 'BMW engineers know what a BMW is, but they would have difficulties developing a Jaguar. They would think it was imperfect. If you asked them to develop a competing car they would again develop a BMW.' The BMW chairman has still to discover exactly what resources Rover has of its own, but he says 'it is a fraction of what we think you need to develop a proper motor car'. 'Does Rover have a wind tunnel? We have a test track in the south of France that Rover engineers can use. We have experts in suspension settings, in noise reduction and in electronics. They are now available to Rover. Mr Pischetsrieder says that the first project that BMW will start at Rover will be the development of a successor for the Rover 800 executive car, which was originally launched in 1986 and was largely engineered by Honda as a sister car of the Honda Legend. No joint project had been started with Honda to replace this car, and it is the obvious part of the existing Rover range, where BMW can begin to gain significant cost savings through the use of BMW components. Mr Pischetsrieder says that the new generation 800 will be derived from the chassis platform of the next BMW 5-Series, which is due to be launched in 1995.

In favor:  The State of Indiana Department of Motor Vehicles emphasizes the importance of the vision waiver as a tool to accurately assess the vision standards for commercial drivers, specifically addressing the condition known as amblyopia, or ``lazy eye.'' The State acknowledges that persons with less than perfect vision often develop scanning techniques to compensate for their disability, and that such techniques may actually increase their awareness of traffic and other conditions. The Tennessee Public Service Commission commented that it has grandfathered vision impaired CMV drivers and found no increase in incidents or accidents as a result.   OOIDA, a national trade association representing the interests of a large number of independent owner-operators at both the Federal and State level, urged the FHWA to revalidate the waivers of the affected drivers because delay and uncertainty cause them significant harm. OOIDA believes that the FHWA's proposal ``strikes a careful balance between safety *** and the federal policies underlying the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.''   The American Optometric Association (AOA) supports the FHWA effort to study the performance of visually impaired drivers. The AOA believes ``it is virtually impossible to unequivocally delineate a visual standard,'' and therefore, contends that a waiver system is needed.   Daily Express, Inc., Mixson Oil Company, Inc. and Altim, Inc. offer the performance of their employees with waivers as examples of the ability of drivers to compensate for their disability and remain safe operators of CMVs. These companies express concern over replacing waived drivers with known safety records with other drivers whose safety record is not of the same high caliber.     The National Private Truck Council (NPTC) also expressed support for the continuation of the vision waivers. The NPTC stresses the need for the type of data being collected from the waived drivers, as no such information currently exists. The NPTC believes that the FHWA's qualifying conditions for drivers, as well as the post-waiver conditions, ensure that those drivers holding waivers are safe operators of CMVs. The Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine also expresses the need for the data being gathered, although it has some reservations regarding the agency's study methodology.   Individual drivers Thomas Breth, James Strickland and John M. Murphy also commented favorably to the October 6 notice. The latter commented on his own behalf and on behalf of a freightline company he owns and operates with his brothers. Mr. Breth, who petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit because he was excluded from the vision waiver study because he did not timely file, submitted extensive records relating to that litigation. Although he supports the waivers, he opposes limiting them to those drivers originally granted the waivers under the determination that was invalidated by the D.C. Circuit in     AHAS, supra.   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers supports the 30-day extension of the waivers, but does not comment on the extension of the waivers through March 31, 1996.   B. In opposition:  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety accurately portrays the FHWA's premise for its ``consistent with safety'' determination as being that drivers with relatively clean driving records are at a lower risk for future accidents and that this is borne out in the crash experience of drivers in the waiver group as compared with the general commercial driver population. It concedes that the studies cited by the FHWA and other studies    1     referred to in the IIHS comments ``(r)epeatedly *** have shown that prior citations and crashes can be used as predictors of future crash risk (citations omitted),'' and acknowledges that such research ``amply justifies driver control policies based on driver records, such as point systems, suspensions, and revocations.''             1     Gebers and Peck, 1994, An Inventory of California Driver Accident Risk Factors.

The IIHS, however, goes on to contend that these justifications are specious. It cites several studies which show that many drivers with clean driving records are involved in accidents, and that many drivers with poor driving records over a three-year period experience accident-free periods of equal length. A 1994 California report is cited which ``did find that crash risk increases as a function of the number of crashes and citations on a drivers prior record. Of the two, prior citations is a slightly better indicator of subsequent crash risk, but subsequent crash risk can be more accurately predicted from a combination of prior crash and prior citation information than from either alone.'' Significantly, it is this combination that the FHWA relied upon to reach its ``consistent with safety'' determination. The IIHS contends that none of the findings in the California report support the proposition that ``the absence of citations or crashes can be used to predict a crash-free future.''   It is apparent from its comments that the IIHS believes that the FHWA, in order to reach a ``consistent with safety'' determination, was bound to predict with some certainty that the waived drivers would be accident-free. The FHWA rejects this contention. The FHWA's determination is based on a reasonable expectation, supported by the studies cited both in the October 6 notice and in the IIHS comments, that the waived drivers with relatively clean driving records, as a group, would present less of a risk to public safety than a representative group of drivers, meeting existing standards, to be used in place of the waived drivers.   The IIHS also faults the FHWA for ignoring the data gathered to date on fatal crash involvement of the waived group. Because of reporting errors by the drivers, which were detected and corrected through the FHWA back-up monitoring systems, much of the information on fatal accident involvement was not available by the time ``The Third Interim Monitoring Report on the Drivers of Commercial Motor Vehicles Who Receive Vision Waivers'' was completed on June 27, 1994. That report analyzes data collected from July, 1992, through February, 1994. The Fourth Interim Monitoring Report, which has been placed in the docket, includes both the fatal and non-fatal accident rates resulting from all data accumulated through June 30, 1994. The fatal accident rate for the waived group of drivers is indeed slightly higher than the general truck driving population. However, in none of the fatal accidents was the waived driver issued a citation or found by the reporting police officer to have been at fault.

Amid a scrum of German and US television camera crews and journalists, Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler's managing board, pledged to boost US ownership of its stock to 10 per cent of the total. Currently, only 3 per cent is in US hands. Daimler is the first German company to obtain a full listing on US equity markets. In an important compromise earlier this year, it agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to produce its accounts according to US standards, paving the way for the listing. The NYSE has been trying for years to attract more foreign companies to its market, especially from Germany. Both Daimler and the exchange marked the debut in some style. Outside the NYSE's imposing entrance on Broad Street, Daimler products were on display - a BK117 'Whirly Angel' helicopter, a shiny red S-class convertible Mercedes, a Freightliner fire truck and models of Eurofighter jets, high-speed trains and Ariane space rockets. NYSE traders stopping for a cigarette break, office workers and tourists all took time to admire the goods. Star attraction was a sleek, metallic-blue prototype sports coupe. 'No drooling on the car please,' shouted one gruff-voiced trader. Back inside the exchange, Mr Reuter was explaining why Daimler was bringing its stock to New York. He pointed out that the group employs 13,000 people at its US operations, which generate 17 per cent of worldwide sales. Last week the Mercedes-Benz car division announced plans to build a plant in Alabama. Meanwhile, the shares - traded like most foreign stock on the NYSE as American Depositary Receipts (each ADR represents one-tenth of a Daimler share) - opened in a flurry at Dollars 47, but slipped back to Dollars 46-5/8. The people gawking at the Mercedes cars were oblivious, however. 'Let's go off in it, just you and me, baby,' said one man to his girlfriend as they stood over the red convertible. 'Nah,' she replied, 'I'm taking the helicopter.' Lex, Page 22; Kaufhof ADRs, Page 28   Companies:-  Daimler-Benz.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT924-6106 ,"FT924-6106 _AN-CKWCKAEAFT 921123   FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (15): Sales bubble of the 1980s bursts - Japan      By EMIKO TERAZONO   JAPANESE truck makers, hit by the downturn in the country's economy, are now hoping the government's public works programme will prop up demand. The cut in capital spending by Japanese companies has caused truck sales to plummet, and the end of the construction boom has added to the gloom. Purchases of highly-priced products have been cut sharply, and sales in medium and large trucks have been the hardest hit in the vehicle market. The lengthy life span of commercial vehicles is also hampering demand growth. The 4 per cent decline in corporate capital expenditure for the present fiscal year is hurting truck sales. Large truck sales for the first 10 months of this year have fallen 20.3 per cent to 129,707 units from the previous year. For the full year, sales are expected to be about 150,000 units, down sharply from the peak of 193,775 in 1990. Profits for the truck makers have been hit accordingly. Hino, the industry leader, with about 30 per cent of market share, said net profits for the first six months to September plunged 66.8 per cent to Y1.64bn. Nissan Diesel fared worse, posting a net loss of Y119m. In the boom years of the late 1980s, the sharp rise in demand from construction, real estate, and trucking drove up sales for truck makers. However, the construction industry is likely to see more than a 10 per cent fall in orders for the present fiscal year, and the transportation industry is also experiencing a slowing in demand. Hino, however, says it expects the government's public works spending programme, which is part of the emergency economic package, to boost sales. Last August, the Japanese government announced a Y10,700bn emergency spending package to support the faltering economy, the bulk of which is to be spent on public works. Hino says that the public works programme will increase demand by some 20,000 units for the industry next year. Mr Jonathan Dobson, motor industry analyst at brokers Jardine Fleming in Tokyo, has his doubts. He says an increase in public works spending will not necessarily mean new demand from construction companies, since the life cycle of a truck is about 10 years. 'There were lots of trucks bought during the bubble, and companies will bring those into use rather than buy new ones.' Additionally, most of the trucks are operated by non-construction-related private companies. And since 70 per cent of vehicles engaged in construction-related operations work for the private sector, which is not expected to recover for another few years, the truck companies projections may be over-optimistic. Shin Maywa Industries, a leading maker of speciality vehicles, such as dump trucks, concrete mixers, and tank lorries, says although public works projects are definitely a positive indicator, the effects will take some time to filter through. 'We probably won't feel the impact this fiscal year,' says Shin Maywa. Meanwhile, truck makers have turned to overseas markets, especially in south-east Asia and the Middle East. Hino saw a 52 per cent rise in exports for the first half, especially in Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia, while Mitsubishi Motors said exports grew 22.1 per cent due to strong demand from Saudi Arabia and Iran. With the anti-inflationary policies through high interest rates eased in Thailand and Indonesia, truck makers believe the fall in demand from south-east Asia has bottomed out. The reconstruction of Kuwait is also contributing to the rise in exports. However, the rise in exports has not been able to compensate for the fall in domestic sales. While increases in exports to China, India and Pakistan may hold potential business opportunities in the longer run, truck makers admit in the short term, profits will not be covered simply by exports. The environmental issue is also pressuring profits, as the series of government regulations over gas emission of trucks planned to start in 1994 is forcing companies to increase spending on research and development. Most truck companies agree that times are hard, and many, including Hino, are looking to diversify into other industries. Mr Koji Endo, analyst at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo, says while the government's public works spending will provide underlying support, the industry may not see a fully-fledged recovery until 1996. One bright spot for commercial vehicles may be connected to the environmental theme. The surge in the country's garbage waste has pushed up demand for garbage trucks. Shin Maywa says sales over the next few years are expected to rise by a stable 5 per cent.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPANESE MOTOR VEHICLE PRODUCTION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Trucks                 Buses              Units    % change*     Units    % change*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1982       3,783,218    -7.8       66,990     -34.9 1983       3,903,823     3.2       55,948     -16.5 1984       4,319,538    10.6       72,209      29.1 1985       4,544,688     5.2       79,591      10.2 1986       4,407,666    -3.0       42,342     -46.8 1987       4,308,100    -2.3       49,987      18.1 1988       4,443,994     3.2       57,413      14.9 1989       3,931,255   -11.5       42,074      26.7 1990       3,498,639   -11.0       40,185      -4.5 1991       3,447,914    -1.4       44,449      10.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Represents change from previous year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPANESE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS 1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Trucks                 Buses              Units    % change 2    Units    % change 2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1982       2,201,366     -1.6      21,793      -4.8 1983       2,226,396      1.1      20,310      -6.8 1984       2,320,938      4.2      20,267      -0.2 1985       2,431,178      4.7      21,573       6.4 1986       2,540,174      4.5      21,617       0.2 1987       2,721,581      7.1      22,018       1.9 1988       2,980,103      9.5      23,542       6.9 1989       2,829,394     -5.1      23,530      -0.1 1990       2,649,909     -6.3      24,925      -5.9 1991       2,632,730     -0.6      23,796      -4.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

0,FT932-5276 ,"FT932-5276 _AN-DFDB5ADTFT 930604   FT  04 JUN 93 / Volkswagen aims to return to profit in third quarter      By QUENTIN PEEL      BONN   VOLKSWAGEN, Germany's troubled motor manufacturer, hopes to be back in profit by the third quarter of the year, after a record DM1.25bn (Pounds .50bn) loss in the first three months, shareholders were told yesterday. Radical cost-cutting, including short-shift working in many parts of the company, brought it to the brink of break-even during one of the months of the second quarter, Mr Werner Schmidt, the group's chief financial officer, told the annual meeting in Hamburg. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chief executive, said production had been cut back by 200,000 units in the January-May period, compared with a year earlier, to reflect falling demand, especially in the German market. He confirmed the gloomy figures for 1992, in which VW boosted its turnover by 11.9 per cent to DM85.4bn, increased output 8.1 per cent to 3.5m vehicles, and productivity 9.6 per cent, and yet saw pre-tax profits slump 66 per cent to DM602m. He said that in the first four months of 1993 the total car market in Germany shrank by 20 per cent and by 17 per cent in the major European markets. Although the market in the US declined by only 0.1 per cent during the same period, VW saw its own sales fall 8.8 per cent. The major cause was a delay in production of the new Golf from the company's Mexico plant, after a strike in 1992. Overall, the group saw a decline in sales of 11.7 per cent, or 144,000 vehicles, with the Audi and Spanish-manufactured Seat models suffering disproportionately, while VW brands lost only 8.5 per cent. The one piece of good news he reported was an increase in sales of Czech-manufactured Skoda cars, which increased by 22.9 per cent. As a result, the company was unable to meet the full extent of demand with its current capacity, he said. Mr Piech spelt out the cost-cutting measures he had already implemented, including 'massive' short-time working, rationalisation of production, reduction of purchasing prices for suppliers, and personnel cuts in all departments. 'We have done everything necessary to ensure that Volkswagen returns to the black as soon as possible,' he said. 'That will not be the case in the second quarter, but we believe we will achieve the turnround by the third quarter.'   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT931-16267 ,"FT931-16267 _AN-DAGB2AEEFT 930107   FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Incentives drive Ford back to US top spot      By MARTIN DICKSON and KEVIN DONE      NEW YORK, DETROIT   FORD Motor yesterday claimed a significant symbolic victory over Japan when its Taurus mid-sized car narrowly beat the Honda Accord to be the top-selling car in the US in 1992. The Accord has held the number one position since 1989. Ford's recapture of the top spot will be taken as a further sign of the renewed competitiveness of the US motor industry against Japanese rivals, which was indicated yesterday by 1992 sales figures for the US vehicle industry as a whole. Ford saw its car and light truck sales rise 11.2 per cent to 3,233,502 units. Troubled General Motors saw a 1.8 per cent increase to 4,449,878. Among the major Japanese manufacturers, Toyota increased its sales 1 per cent to 1,023,641. Nissan was virtually unchanged at 578,844, while Honda sales dipped 4 per cent to 768,845. According to Ford's estimates, the total US car and light truck market rose 4 per cent over 1991 to 13.1m units. The Ford Taurus, relaunched in late 1991, sold 409,751 units, up from 299,700, while the Honda Accord dipped from 399,297 to 393,477. However, Ford's victory was only achieved through offering big discounts and cheap lease finance to customers. The drive began in August and reached a peak last month as the company scrambled to close the gap with Honda. Ford offered even more lavish incentives, including rebates to dealers willing to put additional Tauruses into their demonstration fleets. Honda replied with cheap financial packages of its own. Ford was also helped both by its far greater number of dealer outlets across the US - some 4,300 to Honda's 1,000 - and the fact that while Honda's sales go mainly to retail customers, a large proportion of Tauruses go to fleet buyers, such as rental companies. Nevertheless, Ford will use the victory as an important marketing tool and plans a major television advertising campaign. Dr David Cole, an automobile expert at the University of Michigan, said that yesterday's figures were an indication that the US was 'at the threshold of building a very powerful industry. The Japanese are scared to death.' However, other analysts said the Japanese were holding their fire in the battle for market share, lest they be accused of causing further job losses at ailing General Motors.

(c) Beds for burning explosives shall be no more than 3 inches deep. Wet explosives may require a thick bed of readily combustible material underneath and beyond to ensure that all the explosives shall be consumed upon ignition. An ignition train of combustible material leading to the explosives shall be arranged so that both it and the explosives burn against the wind. When wind velocity exceeds 15 miles per hour, no disposal by burning shall take place. For direct ignition of a combustible train, either a safety fuse long enough to permit personnel to reach protective shelter or a black powder squib initiated by an electric current controlled from a distance or protective structure shall be used. Tying two or more squibs together may be necessary to ensure ignition of the combustible train. Combustible materials are not needed for burning solid propellants ignited by squibs. The sites of misfires shall be evacuated for at least 30 minutes, after which two qualified persons shall approach the position of the explosives: one shall examine the misfire; the other shall act as backup.

The components should be placed on their sides or in that position exposing the largest area to the influence of initiating explosives. Demolition blocks shall be placed in intimate contact on top of the item to be detonated, secured by earth packed over them. Under certain circumstances, materials such as bangalore torpedoes and bulk high explosives may be substituted for demolition blocks.    (b) Local regulations, atmosphere conditions, earth strata, etc., determine how many projectiles and explosives shall be destroyed at one time, both in pits and open sites. Taking these variables into account, the acceptable quantity shall be based on criteria in Subpart D of this part. The procedure should be used for destruction of fragmentation grenades, HE projectiles, mines, mortar shells, bombs, photoflash munitions, and HE rocket heads that have been separated from motors. When a demolition area is remote from inhabited buildings, boundaries, work areas, and storage areas, detonation may be accomplished without the aid of a pit, space permitting.

An earlier mandatory insurance law, which requires drivers to submit proof of  having liability coverage only after having an accident, will remain on the  books.    The law requiring that all motorists stopped by police for traffic violations  show proof of insurance -- which meant much tougher enforcement of the  mandatory rule -- will expire at the end of the year unless the Legislature  takes emergency action to continue it when it convenes a new session in  December.    The chairmen of both the Assembly and Senate insurance committees said this is  not expected.    Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who authored the 1985 law for stiffer mandatory  insurance enforcement, only to see it challenged in court and delayed until  late 1987 -- said he decided that because the Legislature had failed to provide  for an affordable no-frills policy, it would be unfair to extend his law beyond  its prescribed sunset at the end of this year.    Efforts by legislators and Gov. George Deukmejian to reach a compromise on  low-cost policies, priced from $180 to $600 a year, fell victim to disputes  between powerful insurer and trial lawyer lobbies, and never came up for action  in the closing days of the session. Lawyers, in particular, objected to any  changes that would reduce a person's right to sue or recover damages for pain  and suffering.    A report by the state Department of Motor Vehicles estimates that 25%, or about  5 million, California motorists are uninsured. In many traffic courts, license  suspensions because of failure to carry insurance are the most frequent actions  taken. In parts of Los Angeles' south and east sides, the uninsured rate is  believed to exceed 80%.    Recent action taken by insurers who run the assigned risk auto insurance system  to stop enrolling drivers with good records had the effect of drastically  increasing insurance prices in urban areas for such drivers.    Robbins said that he fears the number of uninsured motorists may now soar even  higher. He said this is preferable to forcing many low-income drivers to choose  between paying for food or shelter and buying auto insurance.

The Ford Taurus, relaunched in late 1991, sold 409,751 units, up from 299,700, while the Honda Accord dipped from 399,297 to 393,477. However, Ford's victory was only achieved through offering big discounts and cheap lease finance to customers. The drive began in August and reached a peak last month as the company scrambled to close the gap with Honda. Ford offered even more lavish incentives, including rebates to dealers willing to put additional Tauruses into their demonstration fleets. Honda replied with cheap financial packages of its own. Ford was also helped both by its far greater number of dealer outlets across the US - some 4,300 to Honda's 1,000 - and the fact that while Honda's sales go mainly to retail customers, a large proportion of Tauruses go to fleet buyers, such as rental companies. Nevertheless, Ford will use the victory as an important marketing tool and plans a major television advertising campaign. Dr David Cole, an automobile expert at the University of Michigan, said that yesterday's figures were an indication that the US was 'at the threshold of building a very powerful industry. The Japanese are scared to death.' However, other analysts said the Japanese were holding their fire in the battle for market share, lest they be accused of causing further job losses at ailing General Motors.

The company sounded a cautiously optimistic note for the year as whole, saying that its new products and cost-reduction efforts should lead to better operating results than in 1992, despite the slow US recovery from recession and global economic weakness. Ford's earnings of Dollars 572m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, compared with a profit of Dollars 223m, or 36 cents a share, in the same period of last year, excluding special accounting adjustments. Sales rose from Dollars 24.6bn to Dollars 26.8bn. The company's automotive operations made Dollars 176m, compared with a Dollars 26m loss a year ago. In the US, it earned Dollars 113m, compared with a loss of Dollars 59m, which the company attributed to increased unit volume. Outside the US, its vehicle operations earned Dollars 63m, up from Dollars 33m a year ago, despite lower sales volume in Europe, which Ford said had been more than offset by cost-cutting initiatives and improvements in other foreign markets. In the US, the company has been helped by a 1.6 percentage point gain in car and light truck market share over the past year, to 25.7 per cent, at a time when Japanese rivals have been losing share. Profits have also been boosted by the fact that lower rebates are needed to sell vehicles in the recovering US market. Ford spent an average of Dollars 875 on sales incentives in the first quarter, down from Dollars 1,000 a year earlier. The results received a strong boost from the financial services side, which earned record profits of Dollars 396m, compared with Dollars 249m a year ago, due mainly to reduced credit losses, increased volume and a gain on a sale of receivables. Mr Harold Poling, chairman, warned that for the US economic recovery to be sustained, job creation and consumer confidence needed to improve. Around the world, the company was still grappling with 'weak economies, intense competition and excess industrial capacity, all of which make improvement of financial results more difficult'.

The 50-50 venture is a boost for the Indian government, which is liberalising the economy and trying to attract foreign trade and investment. The announcement comes as Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is preparing to set off on a visit to the US aimed partly at promoting inward investment. GM will bring to India its Astra hatchback saloon, produced by Adam Opel, the group's German subsidiary. The partners plan to build 20,000 Astras a year, starting in the third quarter of 1995, at a Hindustan Motors plant at Baroda, in the western state of Gujarat. The proportion of local content in the vehicle is set to rise to 70 per cent over three years. Mr Greg De Yonker, executive vice-president of GM Overseas Distribution, said GM had been drawn to India by the government's economic liberalisation policies. 'We hope they will continue carrying them out, as they have said they will,' he said. Mr CK Birla, chairman of the joint venture, said it was 'a very positive sign of the world's confidence in India' that GM had decided to invest. GM produced vehicles in India between 1928 and 1954, when it pulled out because of the country's poor economic prospects. It developed ties with Hindustan Motors through licensing agreements to make Bedford lorries and Vauxhall cars. Hindustan Motors is best-known as the manufacturer of the Ambassador, a model based on the 1950s Morris Oxford. The joint venture was first proposed in 1990, but delayed by changes in the Indian government, shifts in economic policy, and the uncertainty caused by the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in December 1992. The announcement follows the recent signing of a joint venture between Telco, the vehicle manufacturing affiliate of the Tata industrial grouping, and Daimler-Benz of Germany, to assemble up to 10,000 Mercedes-Benz cars a year. Sipani Automobiles, a Bangalore-based engineering company, earlier this year started assembling Montego cars from kits supplied by Rover Group of the UK. In Bombay, Premier Automobiles, which has long-standing links with Fiat of Italy, is discussing a joint venture with Peugeot of France to make Peugeot's 309 model.

0,FT941-12449 ,"FT941-12449 _AN-EA3BCAE4FT 940129   FT  29 JAN 94 / Motoring: Modern cars out of their depth      By STUART MARSHALL   The floods have gone - for now - but many motorists are still counting the cost of trying to drive through them. They are faced with bills for re-building engines wrecked by water sucked through air intakes. The result can be dramatic. Water cannot be compressed. If even an eggcup full gets through the air intake into the combustion chamber - the space between the cylinder head and piston top - there will be a very expensive noise. It will be the sound of one or more of the connecting rods bending or breaking, leading to a damaged cylinder head and, quite possibly, to a hole being smashed in the cylinder block. Unfortunate motorists who have had to pay up to Pounds 5,000 for complete engine re-builds, have complained to the car-makers, dealers and motoring organisations. They have had little satisfaction. Many drivers with comprehensive policies have found insurance companies do not automatically regard engines wrecked by flood water as having been damaged accidentally. Cars, they are told, are designed to be driven on roads, not through shallow lakes. Years ago, cars with lots of space under the bonnet and air intakes high above their engines could manage a foot (30cm) of flood water if driven slowly. Not so modern cars, which are shaped by fashion, the need for good forward vision and minimum aerodynamic drag. Together, this means that bonnets - and engine air pick-up points - have to be low. The Automobile Association has been contacted by many aggrieved members, including one who destroyed the engine of a two-week old car driving through floods. But Roy Staunton, of AA Technical Services, has simple advice for any driver of a modern car confronted by water. If it is more than 10in (25cm) deep at the very maximum, do not even think of driving through. If, however, you must proceed, drive very slowly indeed so that it does not splash up under the bonnet or make a bow wave. Says Staunton: 'I don't mean reducing your speed from 40mph (64kph) to 20mph (32kph) but, literally, to a walking pace.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Martin Luther King Jr. and Bishop Oscar Arnulfo  Romero of El Salvador, two assassinated civil rights activists.    He nearly followed them full circle in September when attackers opened fire on  his car, killing his bodyguard-driver and wounding his adopted son.    Father Andres Giron, a 42-year-old Roman Catholic priest, hasn't stopped what  he has been doing -- pressing for land reform and seeking permission from the  Vatican to run for president of this Central American country.    But that doesn't mean that he is fearless.    ""I'm afraid,"" he said. ""Sometimes I think it's better to be a live burro than a  dead thoroughbred.""    Giron, a U.S.-educated cleric who taught in the slums of Memphis, Tenn., in the  1960s and marched with King in the city's garbage workers' strike, continues to  pursue land reform even though it can be mortally dangerous to do so.      Slaughter Quelled    His father and four other relatives were among the estimated 100,000 people  killed in political violence during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Local and  international human rights groups blame government security forces for the vast  majority of the killings. The slaughter of suspected leftists quelled a  stubborn, decades-old insurgency, though pockets of guerrilla activity remain.    Giron spent 1981-83 in the United States because of threats on his life here.    ""In Guatemala, land is the source of power. No land, no power,"" he said in an  interview beneath an almond tree next to his church in Tiquisate, 55 miles  southwest of Guatemala City.    Two bodyguards, one with a submachine gun and the other cradling a shotgun,  leaned against the priest's car nearby. Giron had just said Mass for about 200  parishioners, among them eight adolescent girls dressed in white lace and  finery for their First Communion.    He told them in the homily that his Christian duty, and theirs, included  ""denouncing the terrible things going on in this country; that officials are  stealing, that the army is killing people.""    He exhorted them to act as yeast in the figurative bread of society, to  contribute to a rising up.      Focusing on Election    Giron has enlivened a political scene already focused on 1990 presidential  elections.    He said he intends to use the National Campesino Assn. he formed in 1986 as the  base for a political party. The party will challenge the centrist Christian  Democrats and rightists who have dominated partisan politics since the return  to civilian government in 1986.    The peasant organization represents 120,000 people, he said.    Ultraconservatives, who with the armed forces ran the country throughout its  modern history, consider Giron a subversive. Some have called for his arrest.    ""This country needs a spark to ignite a revolution, and I want to be part of  that revolution,"" he said.    The priest calculates that 71% of Guatemala's arable land is owned by 1% of its  population. Others dispute that figure. But there is agreement that land  distribution is among the most skewed in the hemisphere, favoring a small group  at the expense of Indian peasants, who make up nearly 60% of the population.    According to the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), enough  uncultivated land is available on big estates to provide five-acre plots to  each of the estimated 500,000 heads of peasant households with no land at all.      Dangerous Challenge    Challenging the gentry's hold on land has always been dangerous.    President Jacobo Arbenz began the country's first and only land reform in the  early 1950s and his initiative galvanized rightist opposition. Military  officers supported by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency overthrew Arbenz in  1954 and returned all expropriated holdings to their previous owners, among  them the U.S.-based United Fruit Co.    AID subsequently described Arbenz's reform plan as ""moderate and progressive""    Giron does not have a detailed plan yet for redistributing land. But he  describes his philosophy as radical. He envisions a Guatemala with no landless  peasants, a place where country people have enough land to grow the food they  need.    ""It can't be done in one year, or even two, because people have to be educated.  But I would make a real revolution here, and they (the landholders) know it,""  said Giron.    Giron, who supported the successful presidential candidacy of Vinicio Cerezo  Arevalo in the 1985 election, said he has letters from the president in which  the Christian Democrat committed himself to land reform.      No Public Commitment    Cerezo has made no such commitment publicly, but he has supported programs to  aid small farmers. He also has used government funds to buy about 11,000 acres  of land to divide among about 3,000 peasant families.    ""All that has been done has been done very timidly,"" said Giron, who with some  followers invaded and occupied fallow farmland in 1986. The government bought  the parcel and sold it to the peasants at subsidized prices.    Giron's campesino association runs three cooperative farms on such land bought  cheaply from the government.    He said Cerezo probably would have pursued small-scale redistribution had it  not been for a coup attempt last May.      More, More Dependent    The military high command backed Cerezo's government and put the rebellion  down. But the civilian administration, which had been barely able to assert  authority against the military in the best of times, became even more  conditioned by and dependent upon military tutelage.    ""May was it for Vinicio,"" said Giron.    Rightists contend that breaking up large holdings would hurt production of hard  currency-earning mainstays of the economy -- coffee, sugar, bananas and cotton.    ""Even in good export years, people are dying of hunger,"" Giron said. ""I'm not  in favor of destroying the productive apparatus. I'm smart enough to know we  can't live without dollars.    ""But I can't go along with a system under which a small group of the privileged  live like kings while most people live like beggars.""

Net profit reached DM133m (Pounds 55m) after a DM342m loss in the first three months. As a result, the first-half deficit was reduced to DM209m from DM1.6bn - which included huge rationalisation costs. Forecasting a slow revival in demand and more benefits to come from cost-cutting, VW said yesterday it expected to break even for the full year. In 1993 it lost DM1.9bn. According to yesterday's report, the number of vehicles shipped to dealers rose 8.5 per cent to 1.6m in the first half, and deliveries to customers increased 7.8 per cent to 1.73m. Customer sales in Germany fell 3.9 per cent, slightly reducing the group's market share to 29 per cent, however this was offset by a 7.5 per cent rise elsewhere in western Europe - where new car registrations rose 6.6 per cent in the first seven months of the year, according to industry estimates. VW showed a 2 per cent overall increase in the region and a decline in market share from 16.9 to 16.5 per cent. Group turnover for the first half was up 6.4 per cent at DM40.8bn while the German parent's sales slipped 4 per cent to DM21bn. German production fell 1 per cent to 698,000 units, but output from foreign factories jumped 8.2 per cent to 862,000. This surge included a 19 per cent rise at Seat, the recently rescued Spanish subsidiary which was blamed for most of last year's losses. Customer sales of Seat vehicles increased 23 per cent. Sales in China, the group's main developing market, rose 14 per cent to 73,500, while south America and South Africa together recorded a 32 per cent advance to 272,000. The group's workforce of 241,000 at the end of June had fallen 4 per cent in 12 months. Analysts said the results were better than expected and showed that savings on labour and material costs were coming through. Mr Stephen Reitman, at UBS in London, said gross margins of 9.8 per cent in the first half were VW's best for three years. He forecast a modest profit for the full year.

0,FT932-9641 ,"FT932-9641 _AN-DEMB5ABCFT 930513   FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC positive about Nafta agreement      By LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS.   THE EC has given a broadly positive response to the North American Free Trade Agreement, while reserving the right to take steps to redress potential unfair trading practices. The European Commission yesterday approved a study of the Nafta agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. The positive reaction was expected and matches the Commission's desire to avoid trade frictions with the US as it attempts to reach a successful conclusion of the Gatt Uruguay round by the end of the year. The study also concludes that the EC's political relationship with Mexico will be affected by the free trade area. 'As the Nafta draws Mexico more closely into the North American orbit, Mexico's relationship with the EC may gain importance as a counterweight' mainly because of the likely dynamic impact on the Mexican economy and its population. The report identifies, however, a number of areas where it believes the Nafta agreement could lead to a loss of EC market share in the US and Canada. Financial services and insurance: The principal problem is the possibility that Nafta privileges could be limited to companies with majority holdings based inside the Nafta area. This would be a 'very important and unjustified discrimination' against EC-controlled subsidiaries in North America. Rules of origin: The EC raises concerns about rules applying to cars and textiles which are more restrictive than in Europe even if they are not actually contradictory to Gatt. Services: The Commission warns that a failure to reach a Gatt agreement covering services could lead to substantial shifts of business to the disadvantage of the EC. This applies particularly to potential business in Mexico. Farm products: The EC could suffer in sectors such as milk products, sugar and meat exports to the Mexican market. It is particularly worried about a clause raising Mexican barriers to the same level as the US after a six-year period. Despite these worries, the Commission says the net effect of the Nafta agreement is likely to be globally positive and ought to lead to a big boost in trade with the EC. The report concludes that if trade relations are more restrictive after the sig-nature of the Nafta agreement, it should tackle these questions within the Gatt framework.

F. In its     Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles and New Motor Vehicle Engines: Gaseous and Particulate Emission Regulations for 1994 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicles and Light-Duty Trucks; Final Rule     (also known as Tier 1), 56 FR 25724 (June 5, 1991), EPA adopted the term ``heavy light duty truck'' (HLDT) for light duty trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 6000 lbs. Pursuant to the definition of test weight in section 216(8) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, the Tier I rule also adopted the term ``adjusted loaded vehicle weight'' (ALVW) (the average of curb weight and GVWR) and required that ALVW be used for emission testing of HLDTs for one-half the fleet in model year 1996 and the entire fleet beginning in model year 1997. Prior to this time, emissions test weights were determined based on loaded vehicle weight (LVW), which is curb weight plus 300 lbs., and this weight was also used for fuel economy testing conducted at the same time. ALVW is higher than LVW. Testing at a higher weight would negatively impact fuel economy values. Increasing the test weight would therefore have the practical effect of increasing the stringency of the fuel economy standard, which might be addressed by adjusting the standard. Under the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (MVICSA), 15 U.S.C. 2003(d)(1), fuel economy is to be measured in accordance with testing procedures established by the EPA Administrator by rule. Also under that provision, fuel economy tests are, to the extent practicable, to be conducted in conjunction with emissions tests under the Clean Air Act. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) is responsible for setting the fuel economy standards. 15 U.S.C. 2002(b).  In its     Light Truck Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Year 1995; Proposed Rule,     57 FR 61377 (December 24, 1992), NHTSA requested comments on the issue of test weight for light trucks over 6000 lbs. GVWR in the context of setting the MY 199597 light truck fuel economy standards. GM, Ford, Chrysler, American Automobile Manufacturers Association and Rover Group all supported the continuation of fuel economy testing at LVW. In its     Light Truck Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Year 1995; Final Rule,     58 FR 18019 (April 7, 1993), NHTSA quoted extensively from a January 7, 1993 letter from EPA to industry trade associations explaining that EPA would consider comments during the NHTSA rulemaking regarding the proper test weight for fuel economy testing when developing EPA guidance or rulemaking on this subject. The EPA letter was further quoted as stating that EPA plans to defer to NHTSA's policy decisions on issues such as the competitiveness effects of the alternatives and would follow NHTSA's resolution of the CAFE issue with conforming amendments to its regulations or policy.  NHTSA then concluded in that notice that the preferable solution would be to retain LVW as the test weight for fuel economy purposes. This conclusion was based, in part, on comments expressing the concern that changing the test weight for only a portion of the light truck fleet would cause consumer confusion and affect the competitiveness of manufacturers with a higher proportion of sales of the heavier light trucks. NHTSA finally quoted from a March 4, 1993 letter from EPA to NHTSA that if NHTSA decided against adjusting the CAFE standard to reflect a higher test weight, EPA would undertake ``the regulatory and guidance revisions needed to allow dual testing.''  Accordingly, EPA is today promulgating a technical amendment to provide that while ALVW is required for emission testing of HLDTs, it is not required for fuel economy testing of such vehicles. Manufacturers may, instead, continue to use LVW as the test weight for fuel economy testing. Vehicle manufacturers, however, have had and continue to have the option of performing simultaneous emissions and fuel economy testing using heavier test weights (ALVW in this case). Therefore, for HLDTs, separate testing using ALVW for emissions and LVW for fuel economy, or combined emissions and fuel economy testing using ALVW is acceptable. However, fuel economy adjustments will not be made to account for potentially lower fuel economy values due to the use of the heavier test weight (ALVW). This technical amendment changes 40 CFR 600.00689 (b)(1) (i) and (h) and footnote 4 to the table found at 40 CFR 86.12994(a) to specify the test weight basis for heavy light duty trucks.  The Agency also reiterates that despite the change in the HLDT emission test weight basis, vehicle manufacturers must still assure that fuel economy data vehicles comply with the applicable exhaust emission standards. The Administrator reserves the right to require the manufacturer to either test using ALVW or submit the vehicle for testing by the Administrator for emission standards compliance using ALVW for HLDTs.  This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes that this technical amendment is noncontroversial and has been subject to notice and comment through NHTSA's rulemaking and EPA's January 7, 1993 letter referring interested parties to the NHTSA proposed rule and advising that EPA would consider comments from that rulemaking. For these reasons, EPA believes that a prior EPA proposal is unnecessary under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B).  Nevertheless, the public is advised that this action will be effective October 3, 1994, unless notice is received by September 2, 1994, that someone wished to submit adverse or critical comments. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent documents will be published. One document, which will be published before the effective date, will withdraw the final action. Another document will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this proposed approval. EPA will consider all comments received by September 2, 1994. Consequently, this procedure still allows the opportunity for public comment under the Administrative Procedure Act, but provides an expedited procedure for final action where a rulemaking is not expected to be controversial, public comment has already been received by another federal agency, and no adverse comment is expected.

0,FT942-1225 ,"FT942-1225 _AN-EFZARAANFT 940625   FT  25 JUN 94 / Exports pick up as inflation fall continues      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   West German inflation is continuing its slow decline as industrial output and exports pick up speed, according to official figures published yesterday. Consumer prices in the most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, rose at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the month to mid-June, compared with 2.9 per cent in May. The month-on-month rate of 0.2 per cent has been unchanged since June. Similar trends were also reported in Baden-Wurttemberg and Hesse, with year-on-year increases of 3.1 per cent and with monthly rises of 0.3 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively. The sluggish trend is widely expected to remain broadly unchanged until September or October, when the annual inflation rate is expected to dip towards 2.5 per cent. Economists said yesterday's preliminary figures supported their forecast of an overall annual rate for June of 2.9 per cent, compared with 3 per cent in May. Meanwhile, the automotive and steel industries reported rising output and federal statistics office figures showed visible exports continuing to rise strongly. The VDA vehicle makers' group said May passenger car production was 15 per cent higher than a year earlier and exports were up 13 per cent. Adjusted for the extra working day this year, the increases were 9 per cent and 7 per cent. New car orders in May were also higher than in 1993, while demand for commercial vehicles was starting to recover, the VDA said. Production of trucks up to six tonnes during the month was 9 per cent higher than a year earlier, although output for the first five months was still down 1 per cent. The improvements were reflected in an 18 per cent increase in rolled steel production during the month. Although pan-German total visible exports and imports fell 9.4 per cent and 10.5 per cent respectively during April, the statistics office noted there were four fewer working days than in March. On an annual comparison, exports rose 8.6 per cent and imports were 1.2 per cent lower. The trade balance surplus of DM6bn (Pounds 2.43bn), unchanged on the month, was well up on the DM1.2bn recorded in April, 1993. Imports are expected to remain weak as domestic demand remains constrained by lower disposable incomes but foreign orders for German goods are still increasing sharply.

0,FT932-17035 ,"FT932-17035 _AN-DDBB7AEEFT 930402   FT  02 APR 93 / VW accused of luring away Opel senior staff      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN, Germany's struggling car giant, was yesterday accused of undermining Opel, its main domestic rival, by luring away senior executives with offers of doubled salaries. In the past two weeks more than 40 top purchasing, logistics and production managers had been offered up to DM400,000 (Pounds 164,000) a year to leave General Motors' German subsidiary for VW, Mr Horst Borghs, an Opel director alleged yesterday. Attempts to attract others, including main board directors, could not be excluded, Mr Borghs added. A VW spokesman said he could not explain the 'massive attack'. A full statement would not be issued until the accusations had been legally assessed. Mr Borghs said that some of VW's targets, after rebuffing initial courtship, had been telephoned by their former boss, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, until recently head of worldwide purchasing at GM in Detroit. He joined VW after a tussle in mid-March. He quit GM one day after saying in a statement he intended to continue working for GM - 'for the company I love and for the people I love'. He is reputed to have been tempted away with a five-year contract worth Dollars 20m. Mr Lopez was followed almost immediately to VW in Wolfsburg by six top members of his Detroit buying team. In a bitter letter sent yesterday to Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's new chairman, Mr David Herman, Opel's chairman, warned that the conflict would ultimately lead to 'counter-measures'. These could include possible legal action if Mr Lopez failed to confirm in writing that he had respected secrecy obligations in his GM contract and that he had not taken any documents to VW relating to the US group's corporate plans. Mr Lopez, by virtue of his key role at GM, would have had access to highly sensitive, top-secret information. According to the letter, employees had the right to take advantage of career opportunities. However, Mr Herman added, it set a new style in German industry when a competitor systematically undermined another company, and to attain that goal made excessive financial offers. VW, which earlier this week reported a crash into an unprecedented DM1.25bn loss in the first three months of this year, was 'creating the impression of wanting to solve its problems through a massive head-hunting campaign at Opel', said Opel.

0,FT933-8010 ,"FT933-8010 _AN-DHRCGADLFT 930818   FT  18 AUG 93 / Rexrodt moves to defuse VW spying row with GM      By QUENTIN PEEL and CHRISTOPHER PARKES      BONN, FRANKFURT   MR Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, yesterday stepped into the bitter dispute between the motor giants Volkswagen and Adam Opel, General Motors' German subsidiary, apparently aiming to defuse the conflict. His intervention is a clear indication of concern at the highest levels of the German government over the damage done to the country's international reputation by the row over the alleged theft of industrial secrets. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as Mr Rexrodt himself, has already publicly urged the two sides to settle their differ-ences. Mr Rexrodt invited Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, for talks at the economics ministry in Bonn last night and he has agreed on a similar meeting with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, to be held on Friday. Both companies have agreed to the discussions. A ministry spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt was not seeking to mediate directly in the dispute, in which GM has accused VW of industrial espionage and the theft of confidential documents. 'He is merely seeking to inform himself about the situation, and about the arguments on both sides,' she said. 'He is very concerned about the situation.' The move was immediately welcomed by VW as a step towards peace talks between the two companies. They have been at loggerheads since Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former global purchasing director for GM, defected to VW in March. GM accused Mr Lopez and several associates of systematically plundering industrial secrets before their departure. There was less enthusiasm from senior officials at Opel, who insist that before the two companies can sit down together Mr Piech must withdraw what Opel sees as anti-American accusations against GM, and his suggestion that the US company was somehow responsible for planting its secret documents on VW employees. In a furious outburst last month, Mr Piech suggested GM was trying to damage VW in a commercially motivated war.

Volkswagen employees might also be involved in spreading false stories and media manipulation, in which Opel 'played a role', according to Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs, a VW spokesman. Mr Wachs was responding to a newspaper report, promptly denied by the legal authorities yesterday, that public prosecutors were considering arresting Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the VW production director at the centre of the row between the two automotive groups. ""Interested parties' - which did not include the prosecutors' office, Mr Wachs stressed - might also have an interest in unsettling members of VW's supervisory board, due to meet on Friday to hear a progress report on an independent internal investigation of the allegations. Meanwhile, Mr Lopez has cancelled at short notice a talk he was to have delivered to a meeting of FDP Liberal Democrat MPs in Nuremberg this week. It is understood he was urged to do so for fear of compromising efforts to bring Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, to the negotiating table with Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW head. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Bonn economics minister, who is trying to arrange a meeting, is a senior FDP member; Mr Otto Lambsdorff, former party chairman, is a member of the VW board of supervisors. According to Mr Wachs, Mr Herman had shown 'no interest at all' in meeting Mr Piech after further efforts by Mr Rexrodt last Thursday. 'Opel always diverts the discussion with new arguments,' he said. It was a great shame; Mr Rexrodt was trying to do his best for both companies, he added, while admitting VW had most interest in a 'gentler' process because it was suffering most from the affair. According to legal experts, arrest warrants in such cases may be issued only if there is reason to believe a suspected person may flee or commit a crime such as obstruction of the course of justice. 'Where can Lopez go?' asked a spokesman for the criminal investigators, noting that as a result of the publicity surrounding the case he had become as recognisable as Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

Unions representing 9,000 white-collar staff at Ford announced yesterday that they would ballot members early next month on whether to launch industrial action against any planned job cuts. Unions representing Ford's 24,400 manual workers are due to meet the company on March 11. They say that they also intend to hold a strike ballot if they do not receive a guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies among production workers. The unions - the TGWU general union and the MSF white-collar union - said yesterday that Ford had rejected all their proposals to avoid the proposed job losses and had refused to consult them. It is the first time in 30 years that Ford has sought compulsory redundancies at its UK plants. In December the company announced it needed to cut its white-collar labour force by 1,200. Ford said so far 650 workers had volunteered for redundancy from staff grades. It also said that the manual workforce had to be reduced by 1,180 at its plants at Dagenham, east London, Halewood on Merseyside and Bridgend, south Wales. So far 530 workers have agreed to go. Ford set a deadline of March 30 for voluntary redundancies but recently it has warned hundreds of workers that they could be made compulsorily redundant. The company said that it had to reduce its workforce because of falling demand for its models and as part of an efficiency drive in its European operations. Both the MSF and the TGWU said yesterday that this week's announcement by Ford of 500 new research and development jobs at its plant at Dunton, Essex did not affect the outlook. They pointed out the jobs were not new but part of a relocation deal with Germany in which the UK would lose more jobs to Germany than were gained. Mr Bob Purkiss, TGWU national officer, said he was urging his members to resist what he called the threat of 'unprecedented sackings'. Mr Jim Thomas, MSF official for the motor industry, added the unions had 'no choice but to urge our members to take a stand against this shabby treatment'.   Companies:-  Ford Motor.

0,FT941-10993 ,"FT941-10993 _AN-EBGC7ACSFT 940207   FT  07 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rover: symptom of a questionable trend      From Dr J. HAMILL   Sir, BMW's takeover of Rover has again raised the question of foreign acquisitions of UK companies. Since 1988, foreign companies have made a total of 986 acquisitions in the UK valued at about Pounds 50bn. Such acquisitions account for almost half of the total value of all cross-border acquisitions in the European Union in recent years. The list of British companies externally acquired includes Beecham, Midland Bank, Rowntree, Jaguar, STS, Pearl Group, Yorkshire Bank, Metal Box Packaging and RTZ Chemicals. Equally important, a large number of small and medium-sized British companies has been externally acquired. While 'green-field' foreign direct investment in the UK has generally been welcomed for its positive effects on the British economy, the economic impact of inward acquisitions is less clear. A recent study by SIBU examined post-acquisition change in a sample of 73 British companies externally acquired since 1985. The study highlighted a mix of both positive and negative effects of external acquisitions. Positive effects included increased capital and RD expenditure post-acquisition, the transfer of innovative management practices and increased exports. The most significant negative effects included substantial employment losses as a result of post-acquisition rationalisation and integration, and the transfer of decision-making out of the UK. There were significant variations in the impact of acquisition by nationality of acquirer. Generally, UK acquisitions by non-EU companies have had a more favourable (less negative) effect than acquisitions by EU-based firms. These differences were related to the initial motivations behind the acquisition. For non-EU based companies, UK acquisitions have acted as an important channel for establishing market share in the single market. Such acquisitions driven by product/market expansion have positive effects if the UK operation is given an important role to play in the overall global/regional strategy of the new parent company. This is less likely in the case of UK acquisitions by EU-based companies which are more cost-efficiency driven. Such deals will be accompanied by post-acquisition rationalisation and big job losses. The UK government has adopted a laisser-faire approach to foreign takeovers of British companies. Given the scale of the phenomenon and evidence of negative impact, this liberal approach should now be questioned. J.

The tussle between the biggest volume carmakers in Europe and the US took a new turn as GM confirmed that the US Justice Department was conducting an investigation into the possible theft of GM documents by former employees. No further details were given, although the probe is understood to involve the group led by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who was the head of global purchasing at GM before joining VW as production director in March. Meanwhile, it is understood that Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, was offered the chairmanship of VW on two occasions last spring. In a statement this week, Mr Hughes referred to one approach and said he made it clear he was not interested. His statement came in response to earlier jibes from Mr Ferdinand Piech, the current head of the German group. Mr Piech suggested in a newspaper interview that GM's accusations against VW were inspired by pique over Mr Hughes's not getting the VW job. Despite upbeat forecasts from Mr Werner Schmidt, Volkswagen finance director, the group's shares shed DM5.20 yesterday in a rising market, closing at DM360.50. According to Mr Schmidt, even if the car market does not improve, the company expects to return to profit in 1994. Traders said the VW price had been affected by evidence heard in a civil case in Hamburg on Thursday in which the news magazine Der Spiegel attempted to have lifted a gagging order preventing it printing further articles containing allegations about Mr Lopez and the GM colleagues who followed him to VW. Witnesses, all GM employees, gave evidence which contradicted some of Mr Lopez's formal statements and denials on the GM affair which Der Spiegel had earlier been obliged to publish by the Hamburg court which issued the gagging order. It also emerged that Mr Hughes, head of Opel until last summer, was approached last spring by Mr Carl Hahn, then VW chairman, who handed over to Mr Piech when he retired in December.

Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, has written to Mr Yoshiro Mori, the Japanese minister for trade and industry, requesting urgent talks before the August break, aimed at revising the April deal on 1993 imports. The Japanese agreed then, in effect, to cut exports to the EC of cars and light commercial vehicles by 9.4 per cent - roughly 113,000 vehicles - on the basis of a European Commission forecast that EC car sales would decline by 6.5 per cent this year. Mr Bangemann said in April that the figures might need to be revised. Commission officials refuse to forecast the expected decline in the market this year and no figure is mentioned in Mr Bangemann's letter. But the officials point out that new vehicle registrations in the first four months of this year dropped by 17.8 per cent. The EC industry estimates that sales could decline by as much as 15 per cent over the year. 'It would need an explosion in (EC) demand to meet our original forecasts,' one senior Commission official conceded yesterday. The Commission has come under intense pressure from the EC industry - notably Mr Jacques Calvet, head of Peugeot-Citroen of France - and the French, Italian and Spanish governments to adjust the April agreement. Acea, which represents all EC manufacturers except Peugeot, said yesterday the two sides would have to act quickly if an adjustment was to have an effect. The April accord was based on the controversial July 1991 'understanding' between the EC and Japan, under which the Community pledged to open its market to full competition from Japanese vehicles by the end of the century. A renegotiated accord would still allow for an increase in Japanese exports this year to the five protected EC markets - the UK, France, Spain, Portugal and Italy. Officials in Brussels expect Japanese manufacturers to compensate for import cuts in the rest of the Community by redirecting EC-made Japanese vehicles - so-called 'transplants' - from the protected market to the remaining seven countries. Transplant vehicles are not covered directly by the July 1991 deal but are 'taken into consideration'.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).     JPZ  Japan, Asia.

0,FT934-7175 ,"FT934-7175 _AN-DKUAIAERFT 931120   FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (18): Not so obscure objects of desire - Cars      By STUART MARSHALL   There are some products which command a loyalty, a reverence which is out of all proportion to their usefulness. These are the ones that somewhere along the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth. Range Rover became a cult car by pure chance. In the 1990s it is the smart car beautiful people everywhere like to be seen in. But it started life as something quite different. Land Rover had been building rough, tough four wheel drives since the late 1940s. British farmers were big customers. Land Rover reckoned that there might be a market for a car a farmer could use on the land all day and then take his wife out in that night. So in 1970, Range Rover appeared as the ultimate dual-purpose car. Only a group of men could have thought that one up. Picture the scene. Farmer proposes an evening out with dinner and theatre. Wife puts on her new frock and high heels. Farmer brings mud-plastered Range Rover, reeking of cow manure, to front door. Wife takes one look and declares: 'If you think I'm getting into that disgustingly filthy thing in these clothes, you must be mad. Get the Jaguar - now]' Like the US cavalry, the horsey set rode to the rescue. Accustomed to hauling hunters behind primitive Land Rovers, they eyed the Range Rover approvingly. With a big V8 engine and full-time four-wheel drive it was perfect for towing a two-horse trailer on the road to meets or across fields at point-to-points. Then a new kind of customer appeared. They did not own chunks of Wiltshire, but hoped to give the impression that they did. Reluctantly at first Land Rover offered them Range Rovers with power steering, four doors instead of only two, automatic transmission and diesel engines. Out went plastic seats and rubber mats; in came Connolly hide and Wilton carpet. Land Rover concedes that at least nine Range Rover owners in 10 never dirty the tyres by driving off tarmac, and that the severest obstacle most climb is a high curb outside a Chelsea restaurant.

0,FT933-1445 ,"FT933-1445 _AN-DIXCIAAQFT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / VW apology for halting Skoda deal      By PATRICK BLUM      PRAGUE   VOLKSWAGEN, the German car manufacturer, yesterday apologised to the Czech government for its sudden cancellation of a DM1.4bn (Pounds 560m) financing package for Skoda, its Czech subsidiary, only hours before the deal was due to be signed in London last week. VW reaffirmed its commitment to expand and modernise production at Skoda and promised to increase the variety of cars to be produced at the Czech plant. 'Volkswagen expressed regrets over the embarrassment caused to Skoda's majority shareholder (the Czech government) by its last-minute decision made last week,' said a statement issued at the end of a three-hour meeting in Prague. The meeting was attended by Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW management board, Mr Werner Schmidt, VW finance director, and Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech trade and industry minister, as well as Mr Tomas Jezek, chairman of the National Property Fund, which oversees privatisations. VW's decision to call off the loan at the last minute came as a shock in Prague. Only a day before the announcement, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister, had welcomed the planned financing, which was to be guaranteed by the Czech government. VW said the financing package was no longer necessary because productivity improvements at Skoda meant investment requirements would be considerably lower than initially planned. The VW group is undertaking a fundamental review of its capital spending plans and is expected to announce further far-reaching cuts in November after a meeting of its supervisory board. VW took a 31 per cent share in Skoda in 1991 and is due to raise its holding to 70 per cent by 1996. It had previously announced plans to invest DM7bn over 10 years, but this figure is now expected to be reduced significantly. It has planned to more than double Skoda's production capacity to more than 400,000 cars a year, modern-ising its facilities and expanding products with the introduction of a second car range. The cancellation of the loan increased fears in Prague that VW was reducing its commitment to the venture. Relations between the Czech government and the German carmaker had soured recently following a dispute caused by Skoda's decision to increase sharply the prices of its cars, and Czech concerns that VW was no longer interested in developing a local nework of suppliers. Neither issue was discussed at yesterday's meeting.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Skoda Automobilova.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.     CZZ  Czech Republic, East Europe.

Daimler described the result as 'exceptionally unsatisfactory', chiefly blaming weak demand in the German car and commercial vehicle market which hit Mercedes-Benz, the car manufacturer which generates two-thirds of the group's sales. Blighted by what Daimler called 'extremely difficult conditions' in world car markets, car production at Mercedes dropped by 39 per cent in the quarter to 94,500 units, down from 153,738 last year when conditions were still what Daimler called 'highly favourable'. The number of commercial vehicles produced fell by 27 per cent to 55,900. The results were not noticeably out of line with analysts' expectations after an accelerated drop in profits over the past two quarters of last year. Daimler indicated last month that profits would be 'considerably down' in the first quarter. But the results served to intensify analysts' scepticism about Daimler's ability to make the DM1bn profit for the whole of 1993 which it forecast last month after announcing 1992 profits down 25 per cent to DM1.45bn. Daimler yesterday predicted a 'significant upturn' later this year as a result of the scheduled introduction in June of the new C-class Mercedes, the replacement for the 10-year-old 190 series, the company's smaller executive car. For the Daimler-Benz group as a whole, total sales dropped 19 per cent to DM18.4bn for the quarter. First quarter sales at Mercedes dropped by 24 per cent to DM12.5bn. Daimler said that the trend in group results was distorted by comparison with a 'highly favourable' first quarter of last year. 'Business conditions deteriorated markedly only in the second half of last year,' Daimler said. At AEG, the electrical engineering unit which made operating losses of DM200m last year, sales dropped 7 per cent to DM2.2bn in the three months. At Deutsche Aerospace, sales were down 10 per cent to DM2.85bn, partially because of invoicing factors. Daimler-Benz InterServices, the services subsidiary, posted sales of DM2.1bn against DM1.74bn. Mercedes sales were hit especially hard by conditions in the domestic market  -where total car registrations dropped by a fifth in the quarter - and in other European countries and Japan. Sales were 'gratifyingly higher' in other south-east Asian markets and in eastern Europe.   Companies:-  Daimler-Benz.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

Prospects of a deal, which could end one of the legal battles between the groups, emerged after private negotiations in the back room of a Frankfurt court. An open court hearing, called to consider an appeal from Opel, the General Motors subsidiary, that seven former GM group employees should be banned from working at VW for a year, was adjourned after Mr Heinz Traub, the presiding judge, recommended that the two sides should look for a compromise. An earlier attempt by Opel to win a temporary banning injunction was turned down because, the court decided, the seven had been drawn to VW by the 'charisma' of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former senior GM executive, who defected to Volkswagen in March. However, further evidence has since emerged to strengthen Opel's claim that VW systematically poached key GM group employees, mainly production and purchasing executives. According to sworn statements Mr Lopez personally approached about 17 people. Volkswagen is still bound by a separate injunction not to continue this practice. Closing yesterday's proceedings, Mr Traub said both companies had already been damaged by the affair. Under orders from the judge to keep strictly silent or risk endangering the outcome, neither company would discuss yesterday's deal. However, three or four of the seven, possibly including Mr Jorge Manuel Gutierrez, head of VW production and Mr Lopez's closest colleague, may be suspended from their normal work if the companies' boards approve the compromise before the end of this week - a deadline set by Mr Traub. Agreement to such a compromise is likely to be seen as acknowledgment by VW that it was at least partly at fault. Rejection will result in a full open court hearing next month at which Mr Lopez could be called to give evidence. He spent yesterday waiting in an hotel near the court but was not summoned. Criminal investigations are continuing into suspicions that he, Mr Gutierrez and a further two of the seven people involved in yesterday's hearing stole secret GM data before leaving for VW. A probe into possible perjury by Mr Lopez is also under way.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Adam Opel.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

Without wanting to appear arrogant, he says, he wants to be the leading supplier of educational and other programmes  - sometimes known as 'edutainment' - published on CD-Rom.

Today, Musical Instruments still impresses but looks dated compared with newer offerings such as The Magic School Bus, a series to be released shortly. It is said to be Microsoft president Bill Gates's current favourite, and features a yellow US school bus with driver and passengers which can be shrunk to navigate through the digestive system in The Human Body or the cosmos in The Solar System. Microsoft's best-selling Dinosaurs of 18 months ago included five moving video clips; Dangerous Creatures, a new release, has more than 100. Vergnes, who has worked for Microsoft since 1983 and has been its European president since 1990, believes that the domestic market for CD-Rom is about to expand rapidly, especially in Europe. He reckons that personal computers equipped for multimedia will reach the 'magic price' this Christmas at which substantial domestic sales can be expected. He defines that price as just below Pounds 1,000 in Britain or FFr10,000 in France. For this, customers will get a PC built around a high-performance Intel 486 or 'Pentium' chip with 16 megabytes of fast memory and a 300-megabyte hard disc together with a CD-Rom player and sound capabilities. In France, he says, some 25 per cent of PC sales are now through supermarkets. Carrefour, the large French chain, is marketing its own range of five models, some of which can handle multimedia. Microsoft is taking the home market seriously. It has some 500-600 people, including educationists, psychologists and software specialists, in its consumer group, and is spending just under Dollars 100m a year on developing new titles. Sales are about Dollars 300m a year. In total, Microsoft spends about Dollars 600m on research and development, most of it on software, which brings a much greater financial return. 'We are over-investing for the future in these areas,' says Vergnes. Success in consumer markets is critical to Microsoft's plans. Its worldwide sales - Dollars 4.7bn (Pounds 2.97bn) last year - comprise desktop applications, PC operating systems, word processors, spreadsheets and database managers. Revenue growth last year was 24 per cent. However, Vergnes admits that 'the traditional PC software market will not grow forever. One day, probably sooner rather than later, most desktops in developed countries will have a PC with a complete suite of business programs'. The company plans to reach sales of Dollars 8bn by 1995-96, but Vergnes says the extra Dollars 3bn will not come entirely from desktop applications. 'Unless we make at least Dollars 1bn from consumer products, we shall not achieve our target.' He is encouraged by research showing that each professional PC installed leads to purchases of - on average - five software packages during its life. But up to 15 purchases of software a year can be expected for domestic PCs if the price is right. The consumer software division is turning out three new titles a month. The competition is not sitting idle. Microsoft's principal competitors, Lotus Development Corporation and Novell, have their own consumer products divisions. Recently Novell, the market leader in networking, announced a series of home education CD-Roms focusing on reading, writing and arithmetic. Microsoft's ambitions in multimedia, however, range across the board. It is spending about Dollars 120m a year on software for the digital superhighway through its advanced consumer technology research group, an elite operation headed by chief technologist Nathan Myhrvold and reporting directly to Bill Gates. Microsoft interprets the highway as an electronic pipeline into each home able to convey an almost limitless stream of information. Database computers or servers provide the data which is unscrambled by a black box on top of the television set. Earlier this year Myhrvold's group announced 'Tiger': video server software which Microsoft says is the first phase of a complex, interactive video system. It runs on conventional personal computers. According to Vergnes: 'We believe that traditional PC technology will develop fast enough so that we can build these servers from inexpensive hardware. We can share the processing load between the network server and the set-top box which, after all, is only a powerful personal computer.' There is, thus, a close similarity between Microsoft's model of the information superhighways and the modern data-processing concept of client-server computing where server computers provide data to a network of PCs. Microsoft's latest operating software, Windows NT, is intended to manage client-server networks. Indeed, Vergnes believes that business will be first to find applications for the information superhighway, with domestic applications following later. He echoes Bill Gates's complaints that most multimedia trials involve only video-on-demand (VOD) - the ability to call a video of choice to the TV screen. While technically complex, he does not believe that VOD is a true test of demand for multimedia services. In consequence, Microsoft's own trials - to be held with the US company TCI in Denver and Seattle next year - will be sophisticated and involve a range of services. Example: Vergnes envisages an education forum where teachers from a broad range of schools and colleges could exchange views and experience.   Companies:-  Microsoft Europe.

The subsidiary of South Korea's largest conglomerate said it would build three mid-sized models based on Nissan technology beginning in 1997 and sell them only under its own badge. Production in the first year will be 50,000 cars, with a subsequent increase. Nissan will receive a total of Y8.66bn (Dollars 84.4m) in royalty and technology fees from Samsung, plus between 1.6 per cent and 1.9 per cent of the shipment price for every Samsung car. Nissan said it saw the alliance with Samsung 'as a way of further expanding its business foundations in Asia.' It said that it would develop a new car based on one of its vehicles for Samsung. A two-litre saloon car was under consideration. It said Samsung planned to build a plant either near Pusan or on the west coast of South Korea to make the car developed by Nissan. Mr Minoru Nakamura, a Nissan board member, said that Samsung's investment in the plant could total Y450bn. The Korean government has expressed concerns that Samsung's entry into the crowded car industry could cause severe problems for the country's other motor companies. Samsung plans soon to file an application for the import of vehicle technology with the ministry of trade, industry and energy. If the ministry turns down the request, it would in effect block Samsung's ambitions. The Korea Automobile Manufacturers' Association criticised Samsung for importing technology, which contradicts the government's goal for Korea to achieve technical independence in the motor industry. Under the contract, Nissan will transfer the technology for its latest range of compacts, including newly-developed engines and suspension systems, and jointly develop new versions for Samsung. It will also provide engineering assistance for Samsung's production of the vehicles, which would use at least 70 per cent Korean-made components. Samsung will have unrestricted access to export markets under the agreement with Nissan, which also granted the right for Samsung to change components and designs as desired. Samsung will also receive advice from Nissan on sales, marketing and after-sales service. Other Korean car companies, including Kia and Daewoo, have previously been forced to accept export restrictions in return for gaining technology from Ford and General Motors, respectively.

He will leave at the end of July by 'mutual agreement'. His main duties, responsibility for the VW brand - accounting for two-thirds of group sales - will be taken on by Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman. Only four of the 10 management directors who were on the board at the time of Mr Piech's appointment are still in their former positions, but Mr Goeudevert will continue as a consultant. Once favourite to become group chairman, he lost to Mr Piech in last autumn's selection, when the scale of the group's crisis was becoming clear. Since then he has increasingly appeared the odd man out, especially following the arrival in March of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua as group production and procurement director. This further eroded his operational role, leaving him basically in charge of marketing the VW marque, while Mr Lopez was adopted as the chairman's closest confidant. Mr Goeudevert's intellectual approach set him further apart from the engineering duo committed to rescuing Germany's biggest volume car manufacturer. He was also tainted by Mr Piech's accusation that the former group board had failed to do its 'homework' during the eight prosperous years, before VW was overtaken by recession in the second half of 1992. After a DM1.25bn (Dollars 737m) loss in the first quarter of this year, the group is heading rapidly back into the black, according to Mr Piech. While markets languish in recession, most of the progress in cutting losses is being made through large-scale labour cuts and pressure on components suppliers for rapid cuts in parts prices. Mr Lopez, who was brought in from General Motors to cut VW's procurement and manufacturing costs, was accused at the weekend of driving Giesserei Mittelmann, a metalworking company, into bankruptcy. 'We are Lopez's first victim,' a lawyer acting for the company said. A Mittelmann official said that having already agreed to reduce prices by 7 per cent, he received last month a demand for further cuts from the start of 1994. A VW manager reportedly told him that unless he agreed to reductions of 28 per cent on products accounting for a third of Mittelmann's sales, the contract would go to Spain.

Mr Clinton will meet the chief executives of the three leading US car makers, as well as Mr Owen Bieber, president of the United Auto Workers trade union, to discuss economic and motor industry issues, including health care costs and the burden of government regulation. But Mr Alexander Trotman, head of Ford Motor's worldwide car operations, said his company would use the meeting to press its case for higher petrol taxes - a case backed by Mr Harold Poling, Ford chairman, at the economic conference Mr Clinton hosted in Little Rock last month. The idea of increased US petrol taxes, which are low by international standards, has gained support in recent months from a surprising coalition of fiscal conservatives, environmentalists, carmakers and international economists. Mr Paul Tsongas, Mr Clinton's principal rival last year for the Democratic party's presidential nomination, argued for higher petrol taxes as a way to reduce the federal budget deficit, and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent candidate, urged an increase of 10 cents a gallon for each of the next five years. But Mr Clinton is reluctant to adopt such a measure, which he says would weigh unduly on the middle class. Although last month he opened the door for balancing higher petrol taxes against other tax breaks for the middle class, he said he regarded an increase of 15 cents a gallon as excessive. Every additional 1 cent would raise about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) a year of extra revenue, although the precise effects on US driving habits and fuel consumption are hard to gauge. The car manufacturers are latecomers to the coalition, but their support for higher petrol taxes is contingent on relief from the current Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency rules, which seek to lower petrol consumption by obliging car companies to achieve an average of 27.5 miles per gallon with their models. The US vehicle market is recovering slowly from recession and analysts expect car and light truck sales to grow 7-8 per cent in 1993, to about 13.7m, writes Martin Dickson from New York. That compares with growth of 15 per cent or more in previous economic recoveries.   Countries:-  USZ  USA.   Industries:-  P2911  Petroleum Refining.     P371  Motor Vehicles and Equipment.

The project will mark the US carmaker's first substantial export of cars from Europe to North America since the early 1960s and will be the first European-produced GM car to be sold under a North American nameplate. The programme is expected to be approved in the next few months, with the car going into production in early 1996 in Germany at the Russelsheim plant of Opel, GM's main European subsidiary. The three-litre V6 engines for the car will be produced in the UK at Vauxhall's plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, while automatic transmissions will be made at GM's plant at Strasbourg. At the Detroit motor show yesterday, GM unveiled a prototype version of the car, the Cadillac LSE (Luxury Sedan Euro-style). It will allow the carmaker to compete for the first time with the Japanese luxury car brands Lexus and Infiniti, launched in the US at the end of the 1980s by Toyota and Nissan. The European-built Cadillac is being developed as a derivative of GM Europe's new top-of-the-range Opel/Vauxhall Omega executive car, to be launched in Europe soon. It is understood that GM is aiming to produce in Germany up to 40,000 units a year of the Cadillac. The product marks an important step in the globalisation of GM's vehicle development and engineering, which is seen as a way to cut costs and make better use of the company's worldwide resources. GM is also planning for the first time to export to Europe a version of its next generation US-produced MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) for sale under the Opel/Vauxhall badges, to compete with vehicles such as the Renault Espace. Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, yesterday said the programme for a European-produced Cadillac was 'one of the most significant intern-ational projects GM had under-taken'. The new car represented a cost-effective way to integrate the group's global resources 'with a fraction of the investment' that it would have taken under the more traditional approach of developing the car in North America. 'It makes little sense to build duplicate components or near-duplicate platforms (chassis) for different regional market segments, when one region can adapt or tailor what is being developed for another,' he said.

BMW stunned Honda on Monday with its Pounds 800m takeover from British Aerospace of an 80 per cent stake in the UK carmaker. Honda still holds the remaining 20 per cent of the equity in the Rover and Land Rover vehicle operations. Mr Pischetsrieder is anxious to maintain Honda as a partner for Rover in vehicle production and development, at least in the medium term. Honda and Rover have forged a close relationship in the past 14 years, and Mr Kawamoto was quick to express dismay at the entry of BMW. He said the BMW takeover had 'negated' the long-term efforts of Honda and Rover to establish a firm future for Rover as 'a British company with its own brand identity'. Honda's resentment at the way that British Aerospace engineered the move was also highlighted yesterday when Mr Andrew Jones, the company's UK plant manager, admitted the company was shocked at the deal. Speaking at the House of Commons select committee on employment he agreed with a suggestion from MPs that the decision could deter Japanese investors from investing in the UK. While he maintained that Honda would remain committed to its Pounds 370m investment in the UK at the Swindon Honda plant, he said it was important to understand the way Japanese companies approached corporate relationships. Mr Jones said they took a long-term view and liked to build their relations on 'trust and sincerity'. Any sudden deviation would affect their behaviour, he said. British union officials, however, reacted favourably yesterday to BMW's purchase after Mr Pischetsrieder gave them the assurances they had been seeking on job security and investment plans in the UK. 'We could not have asked for anything more positive,' said Mr John Allen, the AEEU engineering union official for the auto industry. Mr Pischetsrieder told them that BMW would guarantee the future of Rover's plants, maintain the commitment to product development plans and keep current employment levels.

Separately the group is planning to cut around 2,500 jobs at its plants in Germany, Belgium and the UK in response to the steep fall in west European new car sales. Mr Jack Smith, GM president, said that agreement had been reached 'on all aspects' of the group's plan to assemble its Opel Astra in Warsaw in a joint venture with FSO, the Polish state-owned carmaker. 'These understandings need to be incorporated into the draft final agreement, which can be done quickly,' he said following a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. In the first stage of the project GM is planning to assemble up to 10,000 Opel Astras a year in Poland. GM will send car bodies from its assembly plant at Antwerp, Belgium for final trim and assembly in Warsaw. GM plans to invest around DM30m (Pounds 12m) for the first stage of the project. It will have management control of the joint venture in which FSO is expected to have a holding of 20-25 per cent. In a second stage GM could move later to full assembly of car kits in Warsaw including body welding, when capacity would be increased to 33,000 a year. GM Europe said yesterday that pilot production could start in Warsaw by the end of the year with volume production beginning by the spring of 1994. Separately GM and FSO are negotiating a technical assistance agreement for the US carmaker to support FSO in the updating of its existing production of the ageing Polonez range, and GM is also planning to assist in the development of components suppliers in Poland. Mr Waclaw Niewiarowski, Polish minister of industry, said that the government had agreed to compensate GM for the high unit costs of the initial low volume car assembly, possibly through a reduction of the vehicle excise tax rate. In west Europe, Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said it was planning to cut 1,700 jobs by the end of the year at its plants at Bochum, Kaiserslautern and Russelsheim in response to the sharp fall in west European new car sales.

0,FT932-17323 ,"FT932-17323 _AN-DDACLAEUFT 930401   FT  01 APR 93 / VW blames loss on failings by management      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      WOLFSBURG   VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest carmaker, plunged into a net loss of DM1.25bn (Pounds 515m) in the last three months. But the worst is past, and the company aims to break even by year's-end, according to its chairman. 'I hope we will have a small dividend, but I cannot guarantee it,' said Mr Ferdinand Piech, chief of the group comprising VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda. The 1992 payout has been cut from DM11 to DM2. Confronting the worst group crisis and the most difficult market conditions since the second world war, VW will this year axe almost 20,000 of the 36,000 jobs scheduled to go by the end of 1997. Groupwide short-term working, which helped cut production by 160,000 to 755,000 units in the first quarter, will continue at least until the end of June. The main plant at Wolfsburg, for example, which stopped production for 13 days in the first quarter, will close down for 17 days in the second. Mr Piech, who spoke of an 'emergency', blamed management and structural failings during the boom of the 1980s for most of the group's problems. 'We did not do our homework,' he said. Only a small part of VW's difficulties could be put down to the cyclical factors that had hit sales. 'Good competitors like our neighbours in France can reach break-even point with capacity utilisation of less than 70 per cent,' he said. At VW the comparable figure was down from an unattainable level of more than 100 per cent last year. The group, which last year saw net earnings plunge 87 per cent to DM147m, yesterday announced that pre-tax profits had fallen 66 per cent to DM602m. In the first quarter of this year turnover was down 10 per cent and deliveries to customers had dropped 11 per cent. Output had shrunk 18 per cent, according to Mr Werner Schmidt, finance director. After slumping into a DM563m loss during the last three months of 1992, the group was still plagued by 'unhappy' market developments. Outlining the reasoning behind his forecast of a return to break-even this year, Mr Piech said the result would be helped by a 50 per cent cut to DM6bn in planned investment. Some DM800m had already been set aside for job cuts. Bitter pill, Page 21   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

Hamburg state prosecutors confirmed the opening of an investigation following suggestions that they should examine discrepancies between testimony and affidavits presented in evidence at a recent civil hearing. The hearing related to the continuing clash between VW and Adam Opel, the General Motors German subsidiary. Mr Hans Wilhelm Gab, vice-president of GM Europe, said yesterday he felt that prosecutors had enough evidence for criminal charges. 'The public prosecutors' office, following thorough examination and investigation, confirms that (Opel's) suspicions are justified. According to its own statements, the office has made 'decisive' progress,' he said. Meanwhile, the federal government was asked to mediate in the battle, and a senior official in the Bonn economics ministry urged the state of Lower Saxony to sell its 19.7 per cent stake in VW. Mr Reinhard Gohner, state secretary, criticised Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony, for defending VW managers, and said it was inappropriate for politicians to be involved. The spying row was damaging the image of German industry and could be fatal if it was not resolved soon, he said. Mr Klaus Bregger, head of the influential MIT association, which represents medium-sized companies, appealed to Mr Gunter Rexrodt, federal economics minister, to act as a mediator. He reminded the minister that every sixth job in Germany depended on the motor industry. Concern over the case soared yesterday following claims this week from Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, that he was at war with GM, and indirect allegations that incriminating evidence against Mr Lopez and his colleagues had been planted. Mr Gab rejected as 'grotesque' Mr Piech's charges that Opel, an 'American' company, was seeking to destroy VW. Opel ensured employment for 400,000 people in Germany, he said. He said Mr Piech, an Austrian, who did not carry a German passport, was mobilising national sentiments in his host country in a manner that 'burdened' German industry as a whole. The VW chairman's attitude reflected a 'psychosis-like bunker mentality', Mr Gab added. The suggestion of a perjury probe came from lawyers of Adam Opel.

The two companies are locked in a legal conflict following GM Europe's transfer of Finnish production of its Opel/Vauxhall Calibra coupe from Valmet's plant at Uusikaupunki to one of its main German plants at Russelsheim, near Frankfurt. The district court in Darm-stadt, Germany has issued an interim injunction in favour of Valmet ordering GM to resume production in Finland. GM said the court ruling involved only a preliminary order and was 'not a final decision on the merits' of the case. The US carmaker said it believed the order was 'wrong' and that it would 'appeal and pursue all available legal remedies to protect its legitimate interests.' Under the terms of the order GM would have to produce 30 per cent of its Calibra output at the Valmet plant. It said that under German law the order took 'immediate effect'. In order to comply with the order it was 'studying the matter' and would advise Valmet of its proposals to restart production in Finland. Calibra sales were currently running at around 3,000 a month across Europe, it said. GM ceased all production of the Calibra in Finland in mid-December. It moved the Finnish assembly to Germany to improve capacity utilisation at the Russelsheim plant and to avoid the added cost penalties of production in Finland. Output of the Calibra began in Finland in March 1991 at a time when GM needed extra capacity in western Europe with new car demand at a record level, but sales have since begun to fall dramatically and GM is being forced to take several measures to cut costs. The assembly agreement with Valmet was not due to expire until the end of 1996. GM halted the production in Finland in December after it failed to agree an assembly fee per car with Valmet following several months of abortive negotiations. GM claimed that it was suffering a DM5,000 (Pounds 2,118) per car cost penalty for production in Finland versus production in Germany.

The teams are expected to be led by Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chairman, and Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive. Honda has a 20 per cent stake in Rover and has made plain its anger at British Aerospace's Pounds 800m sale of its 80 per cent stake to BMW. The Japanese manufacturer has worked closely with Rover for 15 years. However, Honda has indicated that its quarrel is not with Rover or BMW but with BAe. It regards Rover as powerless to have prevented the sale and is understood not to blame BMW for taking the opportunity to buy Rover. Both parties are going to Tokyo to persuade Honda not to withdraw from its collaboration with Rover and point to benefits in long-term tripartite co-operation. Mr Pischetsrieder yesterday vigorously denied rumours that BMW planned to reduce the Rover product range. He also repeated pledges that the British business would be run as an independent operation, adding that aggregate sales of DM40bn (Pounds 15.7bn) and the expected profits would offer job security to employees of both companies. Earlier this week, he promised 'considerably higher' investment in Rover than had been planned by BAe. BMW also said yesterday that it expected to boost profits by 20-30 per cent this year, recovering much of the ground lost in 1993 when net profits slumped almost 30 per cent, from DM726m to about DM510m. The group forecast a 5 per cent increase in deliveries of BMW models, and said income from the British business could increase earnings further. Mr Pischetsrieder based his optimism on new models due on the market this year, economic recovery in Europe and accelerating demand in the US. A compact, two-door version of the successful 3-Series was expected to bolster turnover, although production bottlenecks were currently limiting delivery prospects, Mr Pischetsrieder said. Further impetus would come from a revamped version of the 7-Series, which, contrary to some analysts' forecasts, would arrive on the market during the second half of this year. Mr Pischetsrieder said that the greatest uncertainty for BMW stemmed from unforeseeable exchange rate variations. But the board was 'well satisfied' with the situation.

Following Mr Piech's attempts to initiate contacts with GM last week, Mr Jack Smith, president of the US car group, informed Mr Piech in a letter received yesterday that all future communication on the espionage affair should be in writing and with Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary. Meanwhile, the first cracks have appeared in the VW supervisory board's hitherto solid backing for Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former purchasing chief at GM and now VW production director. Mr Klaus Volkert, representing the group's workforce on the board which oversees and appoints top management, said if charges against Mr Lopez seemed likely, he would withdraw his support. Mr Herman has told Mr Piech he must publicly withdraw insinuations that Opel could have tampered with evidence in the industrial spying case which has wrecked relations between the two car groups. Withdrawal was a condition of further contacts, Mr Herman said on Monday night. Late last week, a day after he made a series of outspoken attacks on GM, Mr Piech's public relations team revealed he had telephoned Mr Smith with the aim of opening talks. GM officials were caught unawares by the 'initiative' - they were unable to contact Mr Smith, away on leave - and have now used it to try to force Mr Piech into a corner. The VW chief has been under intense pressure from the Bonn government and colleagues in German industry to seek conciliation following his outspoken statements last week, which were widely seen as damaging Germany's reputation. Mr Piech said last week he regarded the confrontation between the two groups as a war, designed to damage VW and the German motor industry. He would win, he said, and warned Fiat and Peugeot that they could be the next targets. Opel had misused the public prosecutor's office, the media and public opinion, he charged. He claimed the US group was leading a personal vendetta against Mr Lopez. Mr Lopez, just back from holiday, is expected to be questioned soon by public prosecutors on suspicions of his involvement in industrial espionage. An investigation by the US Justice Department has added a political dimension to the affair. Piech qualifies VW profits target, Page 19   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     General Motors Corp.

The further reductions follow the announcements earlier this week that Nissan is being forced to halve production at its Sunderland plant during November and December, and that Vauxhall is cutting output at its Luton plant this month. Ford is to eliminate 18 shifts at its plant at Halewood, Merseyside, during October, the equivalent of stopping production for two weeks. The short-time working at Halewood, which produces the Ford Escort, will cause the loss of about 7,000 cars - more than a third of the plant's planned output. By the end of October Ford will have cut 42 shifts at Halewood this year. About 16 per cent of Halewood's production of cars and vans was exported last year, but Ford yesterday said that in the face of the big fall in demand in continental European markets it had been forced to stop car exports from the plant. Ford will cut one shift during October at its plant in Dagenham, Essex, which produces the Fiesta small car, while the Transit van plant at Southampton will work a four-day week. Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, yesterday said that it would be forced to stop production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra for at least two weeks at its plant at Luton, Bedfordshire, during October with the loss of around 8,000 cars. The Luton plant has been one of those hit hardest by short-time working since the beginning of the year, and by the end of October it will already have lost the equivalent of 10 weeks of production. The plant will produce no cars in the first and fourth weeks of October. The Luton plant has been badly affected during September with the loss of 14 shifts, including a complete halt in production this week. Vauxhall said that it expected its plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, which produces the Astra, to work normally during October after losing 11 shifts during September. Both Ford and Vauxhall said yesterday that there would be no lay-offs at the Halewood and Luton plants, and that workers would be brought in for additional training programmes.

The US carmaker has chosen to locate the plant in Germany despite the burden of German labour costs, the highest in the world motor vehicle industry. Mr David Herman, chairman of Opel, GM's German subsidiary, said that the group had decided on Kaiserslautern, because of progress it had made in introducing streamlined 'lean' production methods at the plant. It has won agreement for team working and the integration of production and maintenance work. The diesel engine plant will operate for 24 hours a day and five days a week and will continue running through rest periods. Shift changes will be achieved without any break of production, and preventive maintenance will be performed as part of normal working time on Saturdays without payment of any overtime premium. Opel is cutting layers of management at the plant from five to four and the works council has agreed to work to lower absenteeism to 'an internationally competitive level' of less than 5 per cent. Opel suffers absenteeism of around 9 per cent at its Bochum and Russelsheim plants in Germany. The company said it believed that with the new labour agreement 'competitive manufacturing will also continue to be possible in Germany'. The choice of Kaiserslautern was a commitment by Opel to Germany 'as an industrial location', said Mr Herman. The plant will have a capacity to produce 250,000 engines a year with production starting at the end of 1995. It will employ 475 people at full capacity and will help to slow the fall in the Opel workforce at the site. GM (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) urgently needs a modern diesel power unit for its European car range. It has fallen behind several of its main rivals, including Volkswagen and Peugeot, in the provision of competitive diesel engines at a time when diesels are rapidly growing in popularity. It was forced yesterday to cut the prices of its 1.7 litre Vectra and Astra diesel cars in Germany by DM1,000 per car to try to bolster sales.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Adam Opel.

It said an emergency cash injection of DM1.5bn would not have an immediate effect. Officials would give no firm forecasts, but maintained that the German parent company would break even. Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, yesterday told workers at the main Wolfsburg plant that the parent and the group would make a profit in the third quarter. Meanwhile, analysts said any 'lingering illusions' that the group could cancel out the first-half loss of DM1.6bn and break even this year had evaporated. VW shares dropped DM11 to DM350.50 yesterday in a falling Frankfurt market. New figures produced by Mr Piech on vehicle deliveries so far this year showed little improvement to support recent claims that orders were improving steadily. Total group deliveries to customers for the eight months to the end of August were 2.1m, 13 per cent lower than in 1992. Even though the figure for Germany was 24 per cent lower at 651,000, home market share had risen 0.4 per cent to 20.5 per cent. Deliveries in the rest of western Europe were down 20 per cent at 704,000, and market share was 16.5 per cent. He gave no figures for North America or Asia, where the group recently admitted it was having difficulties. The new Golf, made in Mexico, is finally filtering into the US. It had been launched in California, the company said. Mr Piech, who has steadily back-pedalled on earnings forecasts for this year, yesterday also appeared to throw doubt on plans to build a new small car, the Chico, in Wolfsburg. This was still the aim, but only if 'production costs at the plant can be reduced to compare with those on a green-field site', he said. Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs, a senior spokesman, said the group 'understood' the decision by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the federal economics minister, to abandon his role as peacemaker between VW and Adam Opel in their row over alleged industrial espionage. Opel was clearly not prepared to talk and Mr Rexrodt had recognised there was nothing to be done. The minister, speaking in Brussels, claimed a good part of his aim had been achieved. He had 'never mediated in a formal sense,' he said.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

GM announced in June 1991 that it was looking for a partner for the business, as part of its plan to concentrate on its core automotive operations, which are losing money in North America. The locomotive business makes freight and passenger locomotives and armoured defence vehicles. Mr William Hoglund, a GM executive vice-president, said that the company had been considering stopping its search for a partner for some time. Since the search began, the group's electro-motive division and its partner, Siemens of Germany, had had a 'very substantial impact' in the market with new AC traction technology, leading to the largest locomotive contract in railway history. GM, Mr Hoglund added, had high expectations for the business, but this needed to focus on its objectives without the uncertainties of a search for a partner. In a separate development, GM yesterday gave a three-year reprieve to a Kalamazoo, Michigan, metal-stamping plant earmarked for closure and 10 months of extra life to a New York plant making mini-vans. The Kalamazoo plant was due to close in 1995 and the New York site the following year as part of the company's efforts to reduce sharply the size of its North American operations. GM said that keeping the Kalamazoo plant open, with about half its current 1,900 workers, would let the company avoid paying workers up to full wages for being laid off. A new labour agreement, reached by GM and the United Auto Workers' union earlier this week, maintains a system whereby GM continues to pay workers whom it lays off - even though the company is suffering from severe overcapacity in the US market and losing money. The New York plant will continue producing mini-vans until a factory in Georgia begins the manufacture of a new generation of vans. Lawyers for GM and for owners of 6m pick-up trucks yesterday asked a federal judge to approve settlement of 36 class action suits brought against the company over the trucks' controversial side-mounted petrol tanks, which critics allege are a fire hazard. Under the proposed settlement, GM would give owners coupons worth Dollars 1,000 towards the purchase of a new truck.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.

0,FT943-15263 ,"FT943-15263 _AN-EGKDTAAUFT 940711   FT  11 JUL 94 / State aid to boost Seat: VW wins battle to gain subsidies for Spanish subsidiary      By TOM BURNS      MADRID   Volkswagen, the German car group, has won Pta40bn (Pounds 195m) in state subsidies for Seat, its loss-making Barcelona subsidiary, after 10 weeks of bargaining with the Spanish government. The cash injection is some Pta20bn less than Volkswagen wanted, but it is a climbdown from the government's previous refusal to bail out private sector groups. Other companies, particularly those in the car industry such as the troubled Suzuki plant in the south of Spain, are now likely to press for similar funding. However, officials say Seat is a special case, partly because it is the biggest domestic car producer and because it is the only manufacturer which has a Spanish trade mark and uses a high level of domestic technology. The Spanish government will provide Pta32bn and the Barcelona-based Catalan government the rest. The Catalan Nationalist party, which runs the regional government in Barcelona and supports the minority Socialist government in the Madrid parliament, had consistently backed official subsidies for the area's most important employer. In the first big clash between the Spanish administration and a multinational, Volkswagen had hinted it might wind up Seat as a separate unit unless it got government aid. The formerly state-owned car producer, which was acquired by Volkswagen in 1987, lost Pta151bn last year and expects to lose Pta75bn this year. A key element in the agreement, which will be formally signed today, is that the funds must be invested in technology for Seat and may not be used to lay off the company's employees. The Volkswagen subsidiary intends to shed some 4,500 jobs, a quarter of its labour force. The government has also obtained important concessions from Volkswagen: The proportion of Spanish-made components used by Seat is to rise from a present 54 per cent to 68 per cent. Seat will be maintained as a separate trade mark within the Volkswagen group and the German parent will keep up the company's design and technology centre together with its capacity to produce new models. Any new manufacturing plants opened by Seat in the future will be located in Spain. Volkswagen will nevertheless press ahead with its plans, announced at the end of December, to close Seat's 40-year-old plant in the port area of Barcelona and shift production to a new factory in the town of Martorell, 30km north-west of the city.

The company, Korea's second largest motor manufacturer, plans to build up to 30,000 vehicles a year at the Osnabruck plant of German automotive and engineering group Karmann. The Korean company announced yesterday it had signed a deal with Karmann to produce its Sportage four wheel drive sports-utility vehicle at the Karmann factory in northern Germany. The agreement is a landmark in the development of the world's auto industry, and signals the determination of Korean vehicle producers to break into European and North American markets. The move comes a decade after the Japanese motor industry took its first steps into car assembly in Europe. Four Japanese vehicle makers now assemble cars in Europe, and a fifth has a plant under development. The Korean motor industry has embarked on rapid overseas expansion. Kia, the second-largest Korean vehicle maker, recently began selling cars in the US under its own brand after entering many European markets for the first time last year. Daewoo Motor, the third largest Korean producer, plans to enter the European market in 1995-96 and recently established a technical centre for new vehicle development and engineering in the UK. Hyundai, the leading Korean vehicle maker, said last month it planned to increase its vehicle production capacity by 60 per cent to 2m units by the year 2000. It plans to build more foreign production sites to reinforce its presence in overseas markets. Kia said yesterday that production of the Sportage would begin in Osnabruck early next year. Initial output is planned at 15,000 a year, but Kia said it was aiming to double output later to 30,000 a year with both four-door and two-door versions. In the first phase the Sportage vehicles will be assembled from CKD (completely knocked down) kits shipped from Korea, but Kia said that in the medium term it planned to involve 'as many German and European components suppliers as possible'. In the longer term Kia plans to increase the European content of the vehicle to around 60 per cent.

He and Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the company's production director at the centre of the investigation, would be interrogated 'as sure as they say 'amen' in church,' the Darmstadt prosecutors' office said yesterday. But legal officials would first have to complete their examination of a haul of documents and computerised information seized from the vehicle group's Wolfsburg headquarters in a raid on August 26. The office recently suggested Mr Piech would not be called because, a spokesman said, 'he is not a suspect'. An interim report on a private probe within VW, presented to the group's supervisory board yesterday, contained 'no findings to warrant industrial espionage accusations,' the company said in a statement last night. Officials said after an all-day meeting of the board that Mr Piech and Mr Lopez would not be leaving. The investigations involving Mr Lopez and three associates, who left the General Motors group in March, are primarily concerned with suspicions of the systematic theft of secrets from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary. The supervisory board, which appoints and oversees the work of executive directors, was also told yesterday that group profits in 1993 could be adversely affected by poor performances at the Seat subsidiary in Spain and in north American and Asian-Pacific markets. However, the German parent and the group would show a profit in the third quarter after a DM1.6bn (Pounds 646m) loss in the first half. The statement issued after the board session once again showed signs of a retreat from earlier declarations that the company would break even or return to profit this year, and that Mr Lopez would remain until he had been found guilty. The supervisory board also reinstated Mr Ulrich Seiffert as main board research and development director with immediate effect. He was removed in mid-March on the same day Mr Lopez was appointed. The criminal investigation, under way since mid-May, shows no signs of an early conclusion. The VW supervisory board, which appointed auditors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand on August 13 to carry out an independent probe, said yesterday it expected a full report by the end of October. However, KPMG will have no access to the 30 computers and quantities of documents and diskettes seized recently by the legal authorities.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Volkswagen.

0,FT942-13618 ,"FT942-13618 _AN-EDXAFAEOFT 940423   FT  23 APR 94 / Motoring: An alpha rating for the new Vauxhall Omega   In Britain, the Vauxhall Carlton (Opel Omega on mainland Europe) was a worthy but under-rated car, coming somewhere in between a Sierra and a Granada in many a business motorist's pecking order. The new Omega - the Carlton name has been dropped - promises to put that right. The German-built Vauxhall Omega range of saloons and estate cars (an estate is pictured above) retain rear-wheel drive although all of them now have an elaborate multi-link suspension once confined to the costliest Carlton GSi and Senator CD models. Safety and security were vital concerns. All Omegas have anti-lock brakes; most are fitted with three-point seat belts for all five occupants, and airbags for driver and front passenger. Remotely controlled deadlocking, with a fuel pump, starter relay and electronic control unit immobiliser are all standard. Buyers have a choice of three multi-valve petrol engines - a 2-litre, 136 horsepower four-cylinder, a British-made 170 horsepower 2.5-litre V6 and a 210 horsepower, 3-litre V6 - plus a 130 horsepower, 2.5-litre BMW-sourced six-cylinder turbocharged and intercooled diesel. There are five standards of trim from the entry-level Select to the poshest leather-seated Elite. Any Omega can have five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Of the four Omegas I sampled very briefly in Scotland last week, a turbo-diesel estate and 2.5-litre V6 saloon appealed most. The diesel, with 'fly by wire' accelerator control, was almost as smooth and silent as a BMW 525tds which has a similar engine. Its torque (pulling power at a given engine speed) is greater than that of any other Omega except the 3-litre and is produced at only 2,200 revolutions per minute. For low speed flexibility and mid-range pick up, not to mention fuel economy and distance per tankful, it would be my choice. The 2.5-litre V6 was more refined than the 3-litre and, of course, more urgent than the 2-litre four-cylinder or diesel. But I would rate any Omega saloon or estate car highly as a comfortable motorway mile-eater, with a good ride and ample agility on minor roads. Prices range from Pounds 15,995 to Pounds 26,950.

It was also the first profit under the management of General Motors of the US, which became joint owner of the company with Sweden's Saab-Scania in late 1989. Saab said a sharp rise in sales, reduced costs, and the weakness of the Swedish krona were the factors behind a SKr726m (Dollars 93m) turnround to a SKr203m pre-tax profit in the second quarter from a SKr523m loss in the same period last year. The second-quarter surge also produced a first-half pre-tax profit of SKr104m, against a SKr684m loss in the first half of 1993. The company said it was 'on track' to make a modest full-year profit in 1994 after five successive years of losses. The total deficit since GM bought in and took over the management was more than SKr11bn. During that time, GM and Saab-Scania, which is part of the Wallenberg family empire, have pumped more than SKr8bn in new capital into the company to keep it afloat. This year has at last brought an upturn, with unit sales rising 26 per cent to 45,200 in the first half from 35,800 in the same period of 1993. Combined with the fall in value of the krona, this pushed sales in the first half up to SKr8.75bn from SKr7.75bn. With the workforce cut in half, to 7,900, over the past few years, Saab's break-even level is now around 83,000 unit sales a year: it expects to sell 94,000 cars this year, compared with 73,600 last year, a record low. A large part of the turnround is attributable to the Saab 900 model launched last year, which drew heavily on GM components and was billed as the car that would make or break the company. It accounted for 27,500 of the first-half unit sales, while the bigger and older Saab 9000 accounted for 17,700. Saab said sales in the US, its biggest market, rose to 10,837 units in the first half from 9,400 last year. This upward trend should continue in the second half, as sales of the recently-launched 900 cabriolet model take off. Meanwhile, a rebound in the Swedish new car market sent Saab sales at home soaring to 9,268 units in the first half from 4,878 last year.   Companies:-  Saab Automobile.

Italian police have uncovered fake Ferraris - sports cars so expertly manufactured that enthusiasts in four countries bought them as the real thing. Raids on three workshops near Modena and Cremona, the heartland of the genuine article, turned up 10 counterfeit cars either finished or being built. One was a copy of a 1954 Testarossa 250 model - an original of which can fetch close to Pounds 1m. 'They are extremely good copies right down to the chassis work, numbering and interior finish', a Modena policeman said. 'Often there is a only a millimetre of difference in the size and parts. Only by looking closely at the metals used was it possible to tell the difference from a genuine Ferrari.' The operation was run by two ex-Ferrari mechanics who had access to original designs. They concentrated on prestige models of the 1950s and '60s. Two Swiss citizens are wanted for questioning about their alleged role in selling the cars. Ferrari alerted the police to its suspicions of a sophisticated counterfeit operation after it received repeated requests for parts to rebuild a car which happened to have an unexplained number of accidents. Modena police say the business began legitimately, rebuilding damaged Ferraris. But when the price for period Ferraris rose rapidly, the car-builders decided to cater to this market. Fakes were sold to collectors in Japan, Switzerland, the UK and US. Police are tracing how many copies have been put on the market: 'It could be a good 40 but we don't know - each one worth several hundred million lire.' Ferrari said yesterday it was awaiting developments to see if it should take legal action to prevent its cars being copied. Mr Robert Brooks, head of the international auction house of the same name, said: 'The replica lark has been going on for some years. But usually . . . whether they are Ferraris, Jaguars or whatever, they are known to be replicas and priced accordingly at about one-tenth the value of an original.' So far, the original purchasers of the fakes would appear to have made no attempt to pass them on. Mr Brooks said it was unlikely they would have slipped through the verification net.

0,FT942-9950 ,"FT942-9950 _AN-EEMC4AA5FT 940513   FT  13 MAY 94 / Chrysler protests over electric cars: Detroit says battery technology can not yet meet Californian requirement      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Chrysler, North America's third largest car maker, yesterday called on California to drop legislation requiring minimum numbers of electric cars to be sold in the state from 1998, claiming that battery technology is insufficiently advanced for such cars to be viable. In doing so, it has formed a united front with General Motors and Ford, which have become increasingly hostile to the legislation as hopes of a battery technology breakthrough in time for the legislation to be met have faded. During testimony to the Californian Air Resources Board, which is responsible for setting air quality standards in the state, Chrysler asked for consultants to be brought in to undertake an independent review of battery technology and consider whether the Californian legislation could be complied with. Under the current legislative programme, from 1998 onwards 'zero emission vehicles' must make up a minimum of 2 per cent of total sales of each manufacturer selling its vehicles in California, rising to 10 per cent by the year 2007. While other technologies, such as hydrogen fuels, are also being investigated, battery-powered cars currently are seen as the only means of complying with the legislation. However, all 'big three' car makers have encountered serious difficulties in building cars with the 100 miles-plus range regarded as the minimum viable for sprawling Los Angeles - and at a cost even remotely competitive with conventional vehicles. 'We believe California cannot achieve its clean air goals in a cost-effective manner by mandating any technology,' Chrysler's manager of environmental regulatory planning, Mr Gordon Allardyce, said yesterday in a statement. While stressing that Chrysler - like GM and Ford - is not opposed in principle to producing battery-powered cars, the company said in its testimony that the price and range limitations involved meant that it seriously questioned its ability to meet the sales obligations. Despite the increasingly strident lobbying campaign from Detroit, the air resources board has so far shown no real willingness either to ease or postpone the legislation, given the severe air quality problems facing the Los Angeles basin in particular. The issue is of great importance to the vehicle industry. This is not only because non-compliance by any manufacturer could theoretically lead to its exclusion from the Californian market, amounting to 1m-plus units a year, but because other states are seeking to enact similar legislation.

Earnings of DM177m at the Volkswagen AG parent company in the three months to the end of September reduced the deficit there to DM768m, compared with DM946m at the half-way mark and a profit of DM289 in the comparable part of 1992, when group earnings were DM549m. Although the improvement had long been signalled through informal monthly reports from Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, the news was well received on the Frankfurt stock exchange. VW shares rose by sharply in early trading, leading a short-lived surge in the DAX index of leading stocks, and slipped later to close DM3.30 higher at DM395. A suggestion from a member of the supervisory board that the group should pay no dividend, compared with DM2 last year, came after the market closed. In a letter to shareholders, the company attributed most of the group loss to difficulties in the Spanish market, and 'the high investment costs and advance payments for new models' which had led to profit problems at Seat, its Spanish subsidiary. The letter gave no further details, although VW had earlier forecast a DM1.25bn deficit at Seat for the full year. Executives at Audi, the quality car subsidiary, last week forecast heavy losses for 1993 after a half-way deficit of almost DM200m. Group production worldwide had fallen 16.3 per cent in the first nine months to 2.19m vehicles; deliveries to dealers were down 15.4 per cent at 2.16m and deliveries to customers were 12.5 per cent lower at 2.33m. Turnover was 11.4 per cent lower at DM56.4bn compared with DM63.6bn in 1992. Only Skoda, the Czech brand, managed to increase unit sales, showing a 13 per cent improvement to 158,000. Volkswagen marque deliveries were 11 per cent lower, Audi slumped 26 per cent while Seat slid 16.5 per cent. The group maintained its leading market share in western Europe in spite of a slip to 16.4 per cent from 17.5 per cent a year earlier, and a 19.4 per cent slump in deliveries to customers. Its share of the German market, where sales slid 22 per cent, declined 0.7 percentage points to 28.5 per cent.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

Daihatsu Motor Company of Japan will build a 660cc mini-car in partnership with three Malaysian partners and Mitsui, the Japanese industrial and trading conglomerate. The initial cost of the project is put at MDollars 400m (USDollars 153m). Malaysia already produces more than 100,000 Proton cars a year in a joint venture with Mitsubishi of Japan. Under the terms of the joint-venture agreement, Daihatsu will take a 20 per cent stake in the project, the local Daihatsu distributor 5 per cent and Mitsui, 7 per cent. The Malaysian partners are the state-owned Permodalan Nasional - which together with its listed subsidiary, UMW Holdings, will control 48 per cent  -and Med-Bumikar Mara, a newly-formed Malay-controlled company, which will have a 20 per cent stake. The new car, to be based on the existing Daihatsu Mira model, will be built at a plant now being constructed outside Kuala Lumpur. The first car is scheduled to roll off the assembly line in mid-1994. Initial production at the plant is put at 20,000 vehicles a year, subsequently rising to 45,000 units. As with the Proton, launched in the mid-1980s, the driving force behind the new car project is Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. However, many question the need for a second national car, particularly at a time when the Malaysian economy shows signs of slowing and sales of Protons in the highly-protected domestic market are falling. Dr Mahathir says the new car will provide a cheaper alternative to the Proton. A standard Proton now costs about MDollars 33,000 on the domestic market. Malaysian officials say that the new car will be given various tax incentives and protection - including exemption from duty of components imported from Japan - and will not cost more than MDollars 24,000. The future of the new car venture was in doubt for much of last year, apparently due to Daihatsu's insistence that its executives fill important management positions in the project. At a signing ceremony yesterday, Mr Takashi Toyozumi, Daihatsu's president, said his company was committed to transferring technology to its Malaysian joint-venture partners. Dr Mahathir is reported to have been dissatisfied at the slow rate of technology transfer from Japan in the Proton car venture.   Companies:-  Daihatsu Motor.     Permodalan Nasional.

The job cuts would bring Ford's total employment losses within its UK operations this year to 2,500. The company said all redundancies would be voluntary. 'No further action will be taken if the targets are not reached,' it said. But in a move which will be seen as designed to encourage early departures, Ford warned that it was reviewing the terms of its voluntary redundancy programmes. Future programmes were likely to offer reduced payments, it said. Mr Jimmy Airlie, principal negotiator with Ford on behalf of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said the company was seeking to blackmail employees into accepting current terms. He said Ford's unions would fight 'rigorously' any attempt to reduce payments. The company has been hit hard by the steep slump this year in continental new car and light commercial vehicle markets. Its share of total new car sales has also declined in the UK, where it is market leader. However, Ford insisted yesterday that the cuts were part of productivity improvements and not directly related to market conditions. The biggest intended job losses, of up to 450 hourly paid workers and 50 staff, are at Dagenham, where Ford makes engines, Fiesta cars and vans, kits for exports and has its general services activities. Up to 350 hourly paid and 20 staff jobs are intended to be cut at the Halewood plants on Merseyside, which make transmissions as well as Escorts, and another 205 jobs are planned to be cut at the Transit van plant at Southampton. Of the remaining job cuts, 140 are to be spread over South Wales plants at Bridgend, Swansea and Treforest, 50 at a Belfast castings plant, 20 at Basildon Radiator and 15 at the Dunton, Essex, research and development centre. Ford made clear that voluntary redundancy programmes could be expected to continue as part of efficiency improvements. These have already seen Ford's UK workforce fall from around 72,000 in 1980 to 31,350, while vehicle output has remained almost steady. The company is also under severe financial pressure, following combined losses of about Pounds 1.5bn over the past three years.   Companies:-  Ford Motor.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Federal Bureau of Investigation officers have sent a three-page list of requests for documents, including all GM affidavits, files and telephone records. The move will come as a further blow to VW, which has been under the shadow of possible legal action against its production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, since German investigators started a similar formal probe in May. That investigation appears to be moving rapidly forward. Public prosecutors in Darmstadt interrogated Mr Daniel Goeudevert, a former VW board director, on Thursday. Although removed from the board early last month, he was likely to have been well informed on Mr Lopez's abrupt switch from GM in mid-March. His interrogation suggests that Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and other executives, may be called shortly. Mr Lopez and three colleagues also under suspicion of espionage, theft and fraud are most likely to be questioned last, lawyers say. The US move suggests the FBI, which started examining the case in July, is launching a full-scale inquiry. Employees of VW and GM could be called for questioning in Washington. The basis of the Justice Department probe is not known, but there have been reports from the US that it wants to examine the VW/Opel issue as a possible test case in a clampdown on international industrial espionage. Lawyers familiar with US intellectual property law say the FBI's demands, and evidence and allegations to emerge from a similar German investigation, suggest suspected wire or mail fraud as the most likely line of inquiry. A catch-all section of the US criminal code forbids the use of postal and telecommunications networks - inside and outside the US - for illegal purposes including 'violations of obligations of loyal and fruitful service' to an employer. Penalties include imprisonment and heavy fines, generally calculated as multiples of the estimated damage to the aggrieved party or benefit to the perpetrators. The fines can apply to companies as well as individuals. VW yesterday called in a firm of accountants, KPMG Deutsche Treuhand, to carry out an independent investigation of allegations that its recruits from GM may have brought secret documents from their former employer.

0,FT941-11629 ,"FT941-11629 _AN-EBCDJAEEFT 940203   FT  03 FEB 94 / Honda considers keeping Rover link      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   The first tentative signs emerged yesterday that Honda is not considering quickly severing its ties with Rover in the wake of BMW's planned takeover of the British carmaker. This came as a Honda vice-president, who sits on Rover's board, began talks in the UK on Honda's options. Officials at Honda Motor Europe's headquarters in Reading began to distance Rover from the actions of its parent, British Aerospace, which announced the Pounds 800m sale to BMW on Monday. 'Why should we be angry with Rover; it was a BAe decision to sell to BMW,' said Mr Chris Rogers, HME's spokesman. Mr Yoshihide Munekuni, Honda's director on the Rover board, arrived yesterday for talks with HME's president, Mr Shojiro Miyake. Mr Munekuni was expected also to meet BAe officials. It is believed that he was keen to review the situation with Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman and BAe's deputy chief executive. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, has made it clear that he hopes Honda will maintain its alliance with Rover. He plans to go to Tokyo next week to meet Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's chief executive. Publicly, Honda in Tokyo has been cool towards the prospect of such talks. However, HME officials accept that a dialogue with BMW must be opened. 'We will have to talk. There was a great deal of disappointment and genuine shock that our trust in what has been a very long-term partnership should appear misplaced. But now we have to start deciding on our European strategy options,' said Mr Rogers. Honda said yesterday: 'We are still shell-shocked and it is far too early' to discuss the future of most of the projects between Honda and Rover. However, Mr Miyake confirmed that one, at least, would not be affected - the sale of Land Rover's Discovery model through Honda's sales networks in Japan, badged as the Honda Crossroads. The agreement runs for three years. Honda's dismay at the way the deal was done is shared by many inside Rover. While recognising that BMW had much to recommend it, Rover managers privately expressed anger at the treatment administered to Honda. 'We have worked closely with Honda colleagues for 15 years and we have built up both liking and a deep mutual respect,' said one. Some industry analysts have predicted that Honda will at least allow existing and planned collaborations to run their course. Editorial Comment, Page 15   Companies:-  Honda Motor.

0,FT944-13004 ,"FT944-13004 _AN-EJ3AVACWFT 941029   FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: BMW shares advance on rising sales and profits      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   BMW's share price rose strongly yesterday after an upbeat statement from the company which said turnover was outstripping record levels reached in 1992, and fore-cast 'positive effects' on profits. Sales, excluding the recently-acquired Rover group, rose 8.5 per cent to DM23.8bn (Dollars 15.9bn) at nine months, BMW said. This was 1.5 per cent higher than in the comparable part of 1992, when the full year's sales hit DM31.2bn, it added. The company, which last year saw net earnings tumble to DM516m from DM726m in 1992, reported a 14 per cent recovery to DM290m on a sales increase of 7.4 per cent in the first half of the current year. The group's share price jumped DM18 in early Frankfurt trading yesterday and closed DM12, or 1.6 per cent, higher on the day. The company's statement suggested production bottlenecks experienced in the spring had been cleared, and forecast demand would be further increased by new variants on the successful 3-Series, due shortly. While car production rose 5 per cent in the nine months to the end of September, deliveries to customers increased 7 per cent overall to 434,000, with a 13 per cent surge in the last month of the reporting period. Analysts at the Bayerische Vereinsbank calculated that production in the third quarter was more than 8 per cent up on the year-earlier period, while deliveries had risen 10 per cent. According to earlier data, world sales of BMW marque models were up only 5 per cent in the first seven months of the year. Deliveries in Germany, up only 2 per cent in the period to the end of July, were up 4 per cent after nine months, according to yesterday's statement. Sales elsewhere in Europe were in line with the overall market growth of 5 per cent so far. However, while deliveries in the UK rose 24 per cent to 39,000, those in the important Italian and French markets were unchanged at 24,200 and 18,700 respectively. US sales, up 13 per cent after six months, were still 10 per cent ahead at the end of the latest reporting period. At 63,500 vehicles, the nine-month total was only marginally short of BMW's US sales in the whole of 1993. Sales in Japan rose 8 per cent to 20,600, while 41 per cent growth in other south-east Asian markets took deliveries there to 17,400.   Companies:-  Bayerische Motoren Werke.

0,FT923-15285 ,"FT923-15285 _AN-CGBA7AGOFT 920702   FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (2): Numbers slim down to fit a smaller economy - The changing structure      By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY   IN DECEMBER 1981 Merseyside County Council made a detailed forecast of trends in the local economy, relating them to jobs. It was thought to be scaremongering. Merseyside had 619,000 jobs in 1977, but by 1981 the total was down to 560,000. The county council foresaw a range of possibilities for 1986 - the year it was to be abolished by the government - from a high of 541,000 to a low of 481,000. It hoped 10,000 jobs would come from inward investment and new initiatives to put the probable level at 500,000. In fact, the worst fears were realised. The 10 biggest sectors on Merseyside in 1990 employed just over 400,000 people. The total of all sectors, about 20,000 higher, was an almost exact straight-line projection of the 'low' forecast. In half a generation, Merseyside has lost about a third of its jobs, the bulk of them manual. The biggest employment sectors in the 1990s are largely service-based, requiring an educated or skilled workforce. Manufacturing, 202,000 strong in 1977, has been more than halved in size in terms of jobs. In the modern - and almost full - environment of the new strategic asset of Wavertree Technology Park, unskilled manual labour is not required. The picture appears desperate for those displaced by Merseyside's comprehensive economic restructuring, but - paradoxically - it is not as bad as it looks. Unemployment rates explain why. The volume of jobs lost since 1977 should have given Merseyside a rate of nearly 40 per cent by now. In fact, unemployment in May was 17 per cent, with 96,319 claiming benefit. This is actually fewer than the 98,610 of November 1988, when the UK economy was booming. But that was then 16 per cent of the Merseyside workforce. Long-term and short-term, the figures can only mean one thing. Professor Patrick Minford, Liverpool University's famous monetarist economist, explains: 'Depopulation is proving the long-term solution. The sort of jobs that have been coming in have been non-manual. This is a good area for non-manual workers. It has good culture and nice housing stock. 'Manual workers have been looking elsewhere; first they commute to work in other towns and cities and come back home at weekends, then they relocate altogether. The collapse of the private housing market in London and the south has helped because the rented sector there is now healthier and more affordable.' While depopulation ought theoretically to damage the tax base and local spending power, this has not been the case because Merseyside's reshaped economic structure is increasingly skilled, professional and middle-class. There are fewer workers, but they are individually better paid, pushing up overall earnings. Coupled with lower costs and housing compared with the south, this helps explain why Merseyside as a whole rarely looks like a place on its uppers. Most people lead an affluent, comfortable life, in spite of the inner city's struggle with decline. This applies not only to professionally qualified or white-collar workers. Mr Terry Greer is chief executive of Johnson Group Cleaners, founded in Liverpool in 1817 and located in Bootle since 1896. It is a highly successful, quoted company, with a thriving international business in the US. Its cleaning and industrial clothing rental business in Bootle is also group headquarters. There are 360 employees on Merseyside out of Johnson's 5,000 in the UK. Local business has grown dramatically, but not jobs. Output increases have come by training a highly flexible workforce with the skills to deliver increasing productivity - and be paid commensurately. Similar productivity improvements and staffing reductions have produced flexible, mechanised, highly skilled and well-paid jobs in the docks and car factories. Meanwhile, white-collar areas such as governmental, financial and professional services have grown because of Liverpool's low cost base. There is usually a shortage of suitable staff. Royal Insurance is a principal employer, while stockbrokers Charterhouse Tilney and BWD Rensburg have strong local bases. Successful law firms include Weightman Rutherfords, Alsop Wilkinson, Lace Mawer, Mace  Jones, and the rapidly emergent Bermans, which also boasts busy offshoots in New York and Manchester and an associate office in Glasgow. Mr Ian Short of Bermans typifies the upbeat mood: 'There were 29 of us in Liverpool in 1979. By 1986 we were up to 60 and we have more than doubled that now. People talk of the need for incentives to attract investment but we have never needed to lever a grant out of anyone.' Like many others, Bermans takes training seriously and supports the Merseyside training and enterprise council. The USM-quoted company, Rathbones, has been a Liverpool business since before 1742, when its records show it was already a successful timber importer and merchant. For most of this century, it has offered personal financial and fund management services, an extension of an original family sideline through which its famous members found time for good works while safeguarding the Rathbone fortune. From about 10 people shortly after the war, there are nearer 200 now, spread between offices in London and Liverpool. According to Mr Sebastian Rathbone: 'Merseyside is a jolly good place to run a business. The quality of people is high. They are not cheap, but they are priced competitively and very loyal. Many of our staff have been here more than 15 years; it makes for a better atmosphere in the office and for reliability. 'Our strength is operating from a low cost area to sell our services throughout the world.' The sector which has come from nowhere, however, is tourism, once scoffed at by some Labour politicians as unlikely to produce 'proper' jobs. Yet it now employs some 14,000 on Merseyside, with others indirectly affected as suppliers of services to the sector. Merseyside had 29m visitors in 1990 - the last time tourism was measured comprehensively - compared with 19m in 1985. Numbers of staying visitors - they spend between Pounds 40 and Pounds 50 each compared with the Pounds 6 to Pounds 8 of day-trippers - nearly doubled to 3.5m. Revenues from tourism in 1990 were Pounds 335m, compared with Pounds 223m in 1985. Last year, Merseyside's average hotel occupancy was 62 per cent, with a July high of 74 per cent. The overall annual figures for Manchester and Cheshire were less than 54 per cent. Mr Samir Rihani, chief executive of Merseyside Tourism Board, says that 10 years ago tour companies used Liverpool as a cheap watering hole between Chester and the Lake District, paying as little as Pounds 15 a night for hotel rooms. The trade rate is more than Pounds 40 now, and the visitors are more likely to stay two nights to take in the Albert Dock and Beatles and other heritage attractions. 'It's all about bringing in money,' he says. 'Money equates to new jobs.' The new industry has also created a new type of skilled operator. When potential inward investors are shown round now, professional guides from the tourism board do the job, well equipped to accentuate the positive. In spite of unemployment, there seem plenty of plusses about.  --------------------------------------------------------------- MERSEYSIDE'S JOB STRUCTURE  --------------------------------------------------------------- Sector                 Numbers employed  --------------------------------------------------------------- Local  national government    86,900 Retail                         53,300 Banking, insurance, etc        51,600 Miscellaneous services         49,900 Medical and health services    41,600 Construction                   24,000 Transport                      21,400 Wholesale  distribution       17,800 Food  drink                   16,300 Tourism                        14,000 Vehicles                       12,600 Mechanical engineering         12,600 TOTAL                         402,000  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Dept of Employment  Merseyside Tourism Board  ---------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page II  "

Traditionally, federal organic emissions controls have been based   on total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions where mass of THC emissions is measured by   a flame ionization detector (FID), implicitly assuming that all hydrocarbon emissions   behave similarly with respect to ozone reactivity and FID response. This approach is   not used for methanol-fueled vehicles because emissions from these vehicles consist   primarily of methanol and formaldehyde, and a FID will only detect about 70 to 80   percent of the methanol and very little of the formaldehyde. For methanol-fueled   vehicles, the methanol and formaldehyde emissions are sampled separately and   measured chromatographically while other emissions are measured by a FID. The   oxygen mass is factored out of the methanol and formaldehyde emissions resulting in   ``equivalent hydrocarbon emissions'', which are then summed with the other FID-measured hydrocarbons to yield organic material (or total) hydrocarbon equivalent   (OMHCE or THCE) mass. A third approach involves separately measuring methane   and subtracting it from the THC to result in a non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC)   mass. For methanol-fueled vehicles, NMHC is equivalent to OMNMHCE (organic   material non-methane hydrocarbon equivalent) or NMHCE (non-methane hydrocarbon   equivalent).   The CAA has established THC and NMHC exhaust emission standards for   conventional light-duty gasoline and diesel vehicles (0.41 g/mile for THC and 0.25   g/mile for NMHC). EPA has also established OMHCE and OMNMHCE standards for   methanol-fueled vehicles (0.41 and 0.25 g/mile, respectively), an NMHC standard for   CNG-fueled vehicles (0.25 g/mile), and THC and NMHC standards for LPG-fueled   vehicles identical to the gasoline THC and NMHC standards. 14             14     EPA Gaseous Fuels Rule: ``Standards for Emissions from Natural Gas-Fueled, and Liquified Petroleum Gas-Fueled Motor Vehicles and Motor Vehicle Engines and Certification Procedures for Aftermarket Conversion Hardware.''

Under this approach, the mass of each organic compound except methane is   measured and adjusted according to its ozone-forming reactivity relative to gasoline   emissions.

A document responding to petitions for reconsideration and containing editorial and substantive revisions to the HM181 final rule was published on December 20, 1991 (56 FR 66124). On October 1, 1992, under Docket HM181 and HM189, RSPA issued additional editorial amendments to the December 21, 1990 final rule (57 FR 45446).     A petitioner to the October 1992 final rule stated Special Provision B65 in 49 CFR 172.102 was inconsistent because the first sentence specified only a DOT 105A500W tank car, while the second sentence pertained to the remarking of a DOT 105J500W tank car to a DOT 105J300W tank car. RSPA revised this special provision in the September 24, 1993 final rule to clarify that the DOT 105A500W tank car is the only authorized tank car for hydrocyanic acid, aqueous solutions and hydrogen cyanide, anhydrous stabilized [58 FR 50235]. However, the second sentence incorrectly referenced a DOT 105J tank car. Therefore, in this final rule, RSPA is correcting the second sentence in Special Provision B65 to prescribe the remarking of a DOT105A500W tank car to a DOT 105A300W tank car.       One rail carrier stated its belief that the regulations adopted under the December 21, 1990 final rule allowed rail cars moving under their own momentum to strike placarded flatcars, including flatcars loaded with placarded transport vehicles, freight containers, and bulk packagings. In order to clarify this matter, RSPA issued a correction in the Docket HM181F final rule that amended the rail car handling requirements in 174.83(b) [58 FR 50237]. RSPA explained that the change was being made so as not to allow an over-speed impact of any rail car transporting a Division 1.1 or 1.2 explosive, a Division 2.1 flammable gas (in a class DOT 113 tank car), or a Division 2.3 poisonous gas. Additionally, RSPA explained that in order to clarify these handling requirements, 174.83(b) was being restructured to reflect the regulatory language that existed prior to December 21, 1990.     After publication of the September 24, 1993 final rule, several commenters noted that 174.83(b) prohibited rail cars containing all Division 2.3 poisonous gases from moving under their own momentum, as opposed to only those containing Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A materials. Commenters further noted that the rule did not prohibit the movement of rail cars under their own momentum for Division 6.1 Packing Group I Hazard Zone A materials. A notice of proposed rulemaking published on July 12, 1993, under Docket HM181F (58 FR 37612), proposed revisions to 174.83(b) applicable to Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A and Division 6.1 Packing Group I Hazard Zone A materials; however, in the final rule, paragraph (b) was rewritten for clarity and did not reflect accurately the applicable categories. Therefore, this final rule amends 174.83(b) to correct these omissions.     RSPA also is amending 174.83(b) to clarify that handling restrictions apply only to loaded rail cars transporting a Division 1.1 or 1.2 explosive, a Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A gas or a Division 6.1 PG I Hazard Zone A material. The handling restrictions will still apply to all class DOT 113 tank cars (both loaded tank cars and those containing a residue) that are used to transport a Division 2.1 material, because of the design of the inner tank supporting system (see 172.203(g)(2), 179.40013, and 179.40026(d)).         Summary of Regulatory Changes by Section             Section 172.102.     Special Provision B65 is amended by changing the tank car specifications referenced in the second sentence to read ``DOT 105A500W'' and ``DOT 105A300W'', respectively.         Section 174.83.     Paragraph (b) introductory text is revised to clarify handling restrictions and to prohibit rail cars transporting a Division 1.1 or 1.2 explosive, a Division 2.1 flammable gas (in a class DOT 113 tank car), a Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A gas or a Division 6.1 PG I Hazard Zone A material from moving under their own momentum, from being coupled into with more force than is necessary to complete the coupling, or from being struck by any other rail car moving under its own momentum.

RSPA revised this special provision in the September 24, 1993 final rule to clarify that the DOT 105A500W tank car is the only authorized tank car for hydrocyanic acid, aqueous solutions and hydrogen cyanide, anhydrous stabilized [58 FR 50235]. However, the second sentence incorrectly referenced a DOT 105J tank car. Therefore, in this final rule, RSPA is correcting the second sentence in Special Provision B65 to prescribe the remarking of a DOT105A500W tank car to a DOT 105A300W tank car.       One rail carrier stated its belief that the regulations adopted under the December 21, 1990 final rule allowed rail cars moving under their own momentum to strike placarded flatcars, including flatcars loaded with placarded transport vehicles, freight containers, and bulk packagings. In order to clarify this matter, RSPA issued a correction in the Docket HM181F final rule that amended the rail car handling requirements in 174.83(b) [58 FR 50237]. RSPA explained that the change was being made so as not to allow an over-speed impact of any rail car transporting a Division 1.1 or 1.2 explosive, a Division 2.1 flammable gas (in a class DOT 113 tank car), or a Division 2.3 poisonous gas. Additionally, RSPA explained that in order to clarify these handling requirements, 174.83(b) was being restructured to reflect the regulatory language that existed prior to December 21, 1990.     After publication of the September 24, 1993 final rule, several commenters noted that 174.83(b) prohibited rail cars containing all Division 2.3 poisonous gases from moving under their own momentum, as opposed to only those containing Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A materials. Commenters further noted that the rule did not prohibit the movement of rail cars under their own momentum for Division 6.1 Packing Group I Hazard Zone A materials. A notice of proposed rulemaking published on July 12, 1993, under Docket HM181F (58 FR 37612), proposed revisions to 174.83(b) applicable to Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A and Division 6.1 Packing Group I Hazard Zone A materials; however, in the final rule, paragraph (b) was rewritten for clarity and did not reflect accurately the applicable categories. Therefore, this final rule amends 174.83(b) to correct these omissions.     RSPA also is amending 174.83(b) to clarify that handling restrictions apply only to loaded rail cars transporting a Division 1.1 or 1.2 explosive, a Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A gas or a Division 6.1 PG I Hazard Zone A material. The handling restrictions will still apply to all class DOT 113 tank cars (both loaded tank cars and those containing a residue) that are used to transport a Division 2.1 material, because of the design of the inner tank supporting system (see 172.203(g)(2), 179.40013, and 179.40026(d)).         Summary of Regulatory Changes by Section             Section 172.102.     Special Provision B65 is amended by changing the tank car specifications referenced in the second sentence to read ``DOT 105A500W'' and ``DOT 105A300W'', respectively.         Section 174.83.     Paragraph (b) introductory text is revised to clarify handling restrictions and to prohibit rail cars transporting a Division 1.1 or 1.2 explosive, a Division 2.1 flammable gas (in a class DOT 113 tank car), a Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A gas or a Division 6.1 PG I Hazard Zone A material from moving under their own momentum, from being coupled into with more force than is necessary to complete the coupling, or from being struck by any other rail car moving under its own momentum.           Changed Legal Citations         On July 5, 1994, President Clinton signed H.R. 1758_now Public Law (Pub. L.) 103272_``a bill to revise, codify, and enact without substantive change certain general and permanent laws, related to transportation,'' including the HMTA. Public Law 103272, 108 Stat. 745 (1994). The purpose of Public Law 103272 was to ``clean-up'' related Federal transportation laws and restate them in a format and language intended to be easier to understand without changing substantive content. Consequently, Public Law 103272 revised, enacted and codified provisions of the Federal hazardous materials transportation law, now found at 49 U.S.C. 51015127. At the same time, Public Law 103272 also repealed the original statute.     The legal citations that appear in this document reflect the non-substantive changes made by Public Law 103272.           Regulatory Analysis and Notices         A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures           This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered a significant rule under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). The original regulatory evaluation has been reexamined but not modified. The changes made under this final rule provide clarification and will not result in an adverse economic impact on industry.           B. Executive Order 12612           This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism''). Section 5125(b)(1) of Title 49 U.S.C. expressly preempts State, local, and Indian tribe requirements on certain covered subjects unless they are substantively the same as the Federal requirements. Covered subjects are:     (A) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous material;     (B) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous material;     (C) The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents related to hazardous material and requirements related to the number, contents, and placement of those documents;     (D) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous material; or     (E) The design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a package or container represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in transporting hazardous material.

0,FT943-1555 ,"FT943-1555 _AN-EIWEEAEHFT 940923   FT  23 SEP 94 / Piech set to oust VW finance director      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   Volkswagen's finance director, Mr Werner Schmidt, is expected to be ousted shortly as a consequence of last year's near collapse of the group's Spanish subsidiary, Seat. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, is understood to be seeking backing for his removal from key members of the company's non-executive supervisory board which will be asked to decide on the issue on November 25. While he can expect to garner a simple majority in favour of replacing Mr Schmidt from among his political and workforce allies on the board, he is believed to be taking pains to persuade members representing the Deutsche and Dresdner banks that Mr Schmidt, 62, should go at the end of this year. Relations between the two men have been poor since Mr Piech's appointment in January 1993. However, the chairman's determination to unseat Mr Schmidt has hardened recently following completion of a secret auditor's report on the circumstances surrounding last year's unexpected DM1.4bn (Pounds 574m) loss at Seat. Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, chairman, was fired last autumn, and the rest of the top management has since been replaced. Mr Schmidt was chairman of the Spanish company's supervisory board at the time, although there has not been any suggestion so far that he was any more aware of Seat's straits than Mr Piech. Shortly after details of the debacle emerged, Mr Piech remarked that earlier, much-lower estimates of the deficit from Seat's management board amounted to 'misinformation', which, in his view, was 'a crime with penal consequences'. It is believed, however, that further action is unlikely, especially since the situation at Seat is still not resolved, and labour unrest and other pressing problems are building up elsewhere within the group. A controversial Spanish government subsidy of Dollars 308m (Pounds 195m), officially earmarked for Seat's research and development budget, remains unpaid while the European Commission competition authorities examine its legality. Labour unrest is fermenting at the Czech subsidiary, Skoda, where the group wants to cut 800 jobs. VW has responded to a strike in its Brussels factory by transferring some the plant's production to Germany. At home, VW wants to reduce the workforce at its Emden factory, main source of the Passat range, by 30 per cent. Meanwhile, the plant has been given the job of repairing or replacing 9,000 faulty gearboxes discovered in the new generation VW Polo, due to go on sale next month.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

0,FT933-8790 ,"FT933-8790 _AN-DHMBNADUFT 930813   FT  13 AUG 93 / German car chief warns of further 100,000 job cuts      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   THE GERMAN automotive industry must shed a further 100,000 jobs and cut costs by between 20 and 30 per cent in the next two years if it is to survive, according to Mr Achim Diekmann, chief executive of the VDA motor industry association. If vehicle and component makers did not regain competitiveness quickly, they would disappear, he said. The association could see no signs of recovery. German car output was expected to drop by 18 per cent this year, compared with forecasts last winter of a 10 per cent decline. This implies a fall from record production of 4.86m cars in 1992 to about 4m. The industry's expectations had been based on hopes of recovery in France and Italy but new registrations in the first seven months of this year have dropped by 24 per cent in Italy and 17 per cent in France. German sales, expected to fall 20 per cent, are down almost 25 per cent so far. In an interview with a German news agency, Mr Diekmann said the domestic market would be hit again in early 1994 by a 16 pfennigs a litre increase in petrol taxes. This, the third increase within a short time, had come at the wrong moment for the motor industry, he added. German vehicle and component makers had already cut 95,000 jobs in the two years to the end of June and were halfway towards the optimum workforce, Mr Diekmann said. Extra demand from the former East Germany had disguised the underlying downward trend and delayed structural changes. Mr Diekmann said that in the first half of this year, when German factories produced 2.1m motor vehicles of all types, a further 1m bearing German brands were manufactured abroad. Plans by BMW and Mercedes to open factories in the US and Volkswagen's projected doubling of capacity in China foreshadow an acceleration in this trend, industry officials noted. At the same time, German components manufacturers are increasingly using capacity outside Germany to supply transplant factories. Mr Diekmann named no companies, but his opinions clearly matched those of Volkswagen, currently embroiled in a spying controversy with Opel, German subsidiary of General Motors. VW, the second biggest industrial concern in Germany, is engaged in cutting its domestic workforce by about 15,000 to 100,000 by the end of 1997. Mr Diekmann's latest forecasts related strictly to the automotive industry which employed 693,000 at the end of May.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

In the interview in today's edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr Ferdinand Piech added that there is a possibility that the group will omit a dividend on its ordinary shares in 1993. Last year's dividend was DM2 per share, cut from DM11 in 1991. The Volkswagen senior management has for several months confidently forecast the group would be back in the black by the year end. The group lost DM1.6bn (Dollars 940m) in the first six months of 1993, a DM2bn reversal from the profit of DM445m made in the first half of last year. Turnover for the half-year was DM38.4bn against DM43.75bn in the comparable period. Volkswagen said the result represented a considerable reduction in losses in the second quarter. In the first quarter of the year the group lost DM1.25bn: losses for April to June were by comparison a modest DM350m. The board said it was working hard to achieve the 'turning point' in profitability in the second half. The group made a small profit in July and Volkswagen said it would strive to achieve further monthly profits, but it stopped short of saying that the group would break even for the the year as a whole. A letter to shareholders praised Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's purchasing chief who joined the German group from arch rival General Motors earlier this year, for his role in helping to reduce losses despite the disastrous economic environment. Volkswagen said that worldwide production dropped 19 per cent to 1.5m vehicles in the six month period, whilst deliveries to customers dropped 13 per cent to 1.61m units. For the Volkswagen marque, deliveries to customers fell 11.1 per cent; deliveries of the luxury Audi marque dropped 27.3 per cent and SEAT by 22.7 per cent. The only marque to increase sales was the Czech-based Skoda division where unit sales rose by 23.1 per cent. VW predicted that it would sell 3.2m vehicles for the year as a whole. Capital investments in the group for the six months fell by 38 per cent to DM2.68bn. The loss for the Volkswagen parent company in the first half was DM946m.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

These are the ones that somewhere along the line have achieved cult status, that are recognised from Kuala Lumpur to Fifth Avenue, from San Francisco to Tokyo. Each has something to offer which is above and beyond any rational assessment of their worth. REAL CULT objects can be identified by their stamina. Not for them the sudden onset of instant fame and then the humiliating relegation to the dusty back shelves. They have staying power. These are the names and the labels that can be spotted across a crowded room, that draw their owners into a sense of kinship with each other; thus, the Gucci loafer. Ever since it was introduced in 1960 the distinctive loafer with the snaffle on the front has been snapped up by modish dressers, by Sloane Rangers, by Voguettes, and by those who simply love a really comfortable shoe. All through the 1960s it sold as if it were one of life's great essentials. Even in the nightmare years when the Gucci logo became so devalued that its sales figures went into free fall the loafer sailed serenely on. For, as with all objects that leap from mere success to cult object, behind the hype there lay genuine quality. Anybody who has ever slipped on one of those soft, featherlight mocassins recognises that here is the perfect all-purpose luxury shoe. It looks good with anything from Levis to sleek grey flannels or a pinstripe suit. Even Dawn Mello, called in by Gucci to restore its tarnished name, felt little need to tamper with the loafer. Handbags were scaled up and down, gilded Gs taken off everything from belts to luggage, but she made sure that the classic loafer was still available in all its original simplicity. She brought back hand-stitching, insisted on quality, toned down the gilt of the snaffle but the basic mocassin has changed little. The loafer comes in soft novocalf, black, dark brown or larice (tan to you). It costs Pounds 195 for the men's version, at Pounds 170 for women. Those who are prepared to shell out for it say it is worth every penny. Those who cannot are busy buying up the copies that are to be found in every high street.

The worse-than-expected result is 20 per cent down on the 1991 deficit of SKr2.24bn and follows a doubling of losses in the final three months of the year when conditions in the car industry deteriorated sharply. The group also took a one-off restructuring charge in the final quarter following its decision to cut 2,000 jobs, more than 20 per cent of its workforce, as part of a new rationalisation programme. It declined to specify the size of the charge yesterday. Saab, jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, is predicting a 'substantial improvement' in its 1993 figures but it still expects to remain in the red. This would be its fifth consecutive year of losses. Revenues fell to SKr14.7bn from SKr15bn, as car sales slid to 86,800 from 87,500 in 1991. The group's three main markets, Sweden, the US and the UK, were all depressed although there were upturns in areas including Italy, Belgium, Spain, Australia and Hong Kong. In 1993, the group is hoping for a better result in both the US and UK, although it expects the Swedish market to remain difficult and other markets like Germany to be tough. It believes its overall result will also be helped by its rationalisation programme, which aims to cut costs by SKr2bn; the devaluation of the Swedish krona, and the launch of a new car model. Details of the new car have been kept under close wraps, although there is no doubt that a success is needed to ensure the group's revival. The model replacement for the 900 series- will be unveiled at the Frankfurt motor show in September before going on sale in the autumn. Partly because of the disruption which introduction of the new model will cause, and partly because of a less intensive marketing drive, the company is forecasting car sales of only 80,000 this year. The group's new chief executive, Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, has already stated he would like to see the group's break-even production level reduced to 70,000 units. Last month, Saab's owners each promised to inject SKr1.4bn in new capital during 1993 to help the group return to profit. They have already ploughed in SKr5.5bn since mid-1991.

Mr Ferdinand Piech had contacted Mr Jack Smith, proposing a meeting to 'discuss the matter between our concerns without influencing the legal conflict', VW claimed yesterday. He had also been in touch with Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, to discuss his initiative, ministry officials said. Mr Piech's call to Bonn followed an offer from Mr Rexrodt to act as a mediator. A ministry spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt hoped the two sides would moderate their language, and allow legal procedures to take their natural course. Mr Rexrodt warned both sides in a television broadcast on Thursday night to take care not to damage Germany's reputation, as too many jobs were at risk. General Motors officials yesterday could not confirm that VW had made contact with Mr Smith, who is travelling during the group's two-week summer break. But they admitted they were surprised by the initiative so soon after Mr Piech had been reported as saying that he would not let anyone 'pee on our leg'. VW spokesmen were also apparently unaware that Mr Piech had spoken to Mr Rexrodt. They were unable to confirm that the VW chairman would renew contacts with Mr Smith at the start of next week, as the group said in a press release yesterday. In an unexpected outbreak of diplomacy, Mr Piech appeared to be responding to mounting political pressure to break the spiral of charge and counter-charge. He told a press conference earlier this week that he saw little hope of a peaceful or early end to the row, which is focused on the US group's allegations that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, its former global purchasing director, and several associates, systematically plundered industrial secrets from GM and its European subsidiaries before defecting to VW in March. Describing the conflict as a 'war', Mr Piech also insinuated that GM, its German subsidiary Adam Opel or their agents could have conspired to pervert the course of justice by planting evidence implicating Mr Lopez and his team. His suggestion of talks also followed confirmation from the US Justice Department in Washington that it had opened inquiries into the case on its own initiative because of interest within the department in industrial espionage in multinational companies.

The increase, announced yesterday, is the most dramatic indication yet by a Japanese vehicle maker of the pressures the Japanese motor industry faces from a sharply appreciated yen, trade friction with the US and growing competition from US vehicle manufacturers in the world's biggest car market. US and Japanese trade officials are holding last-minute negotiations over how to increase foreign penetration of Japan's vehicle market. The US is poised to take steps towards imposing sanctions against Japan at the end of this month unless an agreement can be reached on several trade issues. US carmakers reacted coolly to Toyota's announcement. Ford said: 'The important thing is whether they're doing anything to improve the trade deficit. What would interest us is whether they can increase the amount of US-sourced material in the vehicles. Up to now, we feel they probably have less than 50 per cent North American content.' Toyota also intends to more than double US engine production and increase vehicle exports from the US by 60 per cent by 1996. In July, Honda, Japan's third-largest carmaker, announced that it would spend Dollars 310m (Pounds 198m) on expanding its North American operations to bolster car and engine manufacturing capacity as well as strengthening its research and development and sales facilities. Toyota said yesterday it would raise total North American vehicle production to 790,000 in 1996, up from 533,000 last year. Eight years ago, production in North America was only 14,000 vehicles. The boost in production will mean that more than 60 per cent of the company's US sales will consist of North American-built vehicles, compared with 46 per cent in 1993. The increase will come from its manufacturing facility in Kentucky, Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA (TMM), from New United Motor Manufacturing, its joint venture with General Motors, and from Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada. The company will not increase existing capacity in North America but will achieve its target by using a second line at TMM, which came on stream in March this year, and by raising productivity. Annual production at TMM will increase from 234,000 last year to 400,000 in 1996. Toyota's overall engine production in North America will more than double to 440,000 units from 207,000 last year.

The programme will pool resources from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler with those of the government's space, defence and nuclear weapons laboratories, and will redirect government research spending. 'Our long-term goal is to develop affordable, attractive cars that are up to three times more fuel-efficient than today's cars - three times - and meet strict standards for urban air pollution, safety, performance and comfort,' President Bill Clinton said at a White House ceremony yesterday to launch the initiative. Some critics complain the goal of around 80 miles per US gallon is technologically impossible. But Vice-president Al Gore said researchers needed to be imaginative. 'After all, considering that this country spends tens of billions of dollars each year to upgrade and improve bombers and fighters, it is amazing we are content to use a technology on our highways that was developed in 1876,' Mr Gore said. US carmakers are currently required to produce a fleet whose fuel consumption averages 27.5 miles per gallon. The US Environmental Protection Agency, in statistics produced this week, showed the overall average of cars sold in the US is around 28.1 mpg, twice as efficient as the cars sold in the 1970s but with little change in the last seven years. Only two car models studied by the EPA, the Geo Metro XFI and the Honda Civic HB, exceeded 50 mpg. Others worry that the programme lacks any commitment for transferring greater fuel efficiency from the laboratory to the production line. Some environmentalist groups fear that the research project might, in fact, be used by Mr Clinton to cover his retreat from a campaign pledge to increase the average fuel efficiency required by law to 40 mpg by the year 2000 and 45 mpg by 2015 - a move fiercely opposed by the car companies. An increase in fuel efficiency requirements is also opposed by many environmental economists, who argue that the problem is not the availability of fuel-efficient cars but the lack of incentive for anyone to buy them while US petrol prices remain so low. Petrol taxes are due to rise by 4.3 per cents a gallon on Friday following this year's budget, but Mr Clinton's efforts to impose a stiffer tax on all forms of energy were shot down in Congress.

0,FT934-17453 ,"FT934-17453 _AN-DJAC3AAZFT 931001   FT  01 OCT 93 / VW set to close Seat's Barcelona plant      By PETER BRUCE and CHRISTOPHER PARKES      MADRID, FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN, the German car maker, appeared last night to be positioning itself to shut down the Barcelona plant of its Spanish car subsidiary, Seat. The office of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, said his deputy, Mr Narcis Serra, had held several urgent telephone conversations already this week with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman. The two men are to meet in Madrid next Thursday. Up to 9,000 jobs would be threatened if VW were to decide, in the light of Seat's large losses this year, to close the company's old plant near Barcelona harbour and concentrate Seat production at its modern new factory at Martorell, about 25km south of the Catalan capital. The Seat crisis, which on Wednesday resulted in the resignation of the company's chairman, Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, has come at a bad time for the Madrid government. Mr Gonzalez's minority socialist administration is trying to negotiate a wages pact with the main trade unions in Spain and to win support from regional parties in Catalonia and the Basque country so as to be able to pass its 1994 budget, presented to parliament yesterday. Yesterday, though, the unions accused government of conniving with VW to cut jobs. In Barcelona, union officials promised fierce resistance to any effort to close down the plant, which produces Seat's new Toledo and old Marbella models. Spanish government officials said Madrid would do everything possible to help the plant survive, but this was likely to boil down to little more than persuasion. Mr Piech plans to spend several days in Spain next week to try to calm political tempers and popular fears roused by his demands for harsh cuts at Seat. The fire-fighting exercise will begin at the VW headquarters in Wolfsburg today, when leaders of Spain's most important trade unions, the UGT and CCOO, fly in for talks. Mr Piech and Mr Klaus Volkert, leading spokesman for the German workforce on the group supervisory board, would explain Seat's structural and financial problems, VW said. Mr Daz Alvarez's 'mutually agreed' resignation was announced one day after a VW group board meeting had rejected as insufficient his rationalisation proposals, including a 22 per cent cut in Seat's 23,000 workforce. VW's demands for radical and rapid action had followed the recent disclosure that Seat was heading for an 'unexpected' DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) loss this year. Volkswagen undertook to inject DM1.5bn but has refused any further financial assistance.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

The US operations had their best third-quarter results since 1988, before the onset of North American recession, but this was partly offset by losses in Europe, which is in the throes of recession. The company's earnings worked through at 79 cents a share, compared to a loss of 66 cents, and were struck on sales and revenues which rose Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 24.5bn. The results, which were flattered by a change in US tax legislation worth Dollars 140m, or 28 cents a share, were ahead of expectations and Ford shares closed Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 60 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. However, analysts noted that the group's profitability was still modest, given that its US plants were operating near capacity. It remains less profitable than the much smaller Chrysler, which reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 423m earlier this month. General Motors, the largest of Detroit's Big Three car manufacturers, will report a large loss this morning. Ford's US automotive operations earned Dollars 333m, compared to a loss of Dollars 260m a year ago, which the company attributed to improving industry sales, increased market share and continuing cost reduction. Ford's share of the US car and light truck market rose to 25.4 per cent in the model year to the end of September, up 1.1 points from the 1992 year and 2.2 points from the 1991 year, thanks to strong-selling vehicles such as the four-wheel drive Explorer and Taurus family car. Profits were helped by a drop in rebates to encourage sales, which averaged Dollars 865 a vehicle, Dollars 200 less than a year ago. Retail sales rose 18 per cent, while much less profitable fleet sales dipped 14 per cent. Outside the US, automotive operations lost Dollars 261m, compared to a loss of Dollars 314m a year ago, with Dollars 217m of losses in Europe more than offsetting earnings elsewhere. Worldwide automotive operations made Dollars 72m, a Dollars 646m improvement on the year before. The bottom line was buoyed by strong earnings from Ford's financial services operation, which made Dollars 391m, up from Dollars 302m, thanks to increased volume and reduced credit losses.

0,FT941-10233 ,"FT941-10233 _AN-EBJCNAECFT 940210   FT  10 FEB 94 / Revival of US demand helps Ford lift earnings to Dollars 719m      By MARTIN DICKSON      NEW YORK   Ford Motor yesterday under-scored the revival of US vehicle demand and its own market share gains by reporting fourth quarter earnings of Dollars 719m (Pounds 479m) compared with a loss of Dollars 840m in the same period of 1992. Ford's European automotive operations, including Jaguar, the UK luxury car subsidiary, posted a slightly reduced net loss of Dollars 960m in 1993 - its third successive heavy annual loss. However, excluding Jaguar, the European operations 'could be profitable' in 1994, the carmaker forecast. Ford made Dollars 669m from its vehicle operations in the US, a Dollars 797m improvement on 1992, but that was partially offset by a Dollars 372m loss in its international operations. Its financial services group earned a record Dollars 422m, up from Dollars 197m a year ago. The results were towards the top end of analysts' forecasts, but the shares fell Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 68 1/2 . Detroit's Big Three motor manufacturers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler  -are all benefiting from a steady growth in North American demand and less intense competition from Japanese rivals, whose cars now cost significantly more in the American market than US ones. Mr Alex Trottman, Ford's chairman, said the company was 'in good shape for 1994. We have strong new products and we expect better economic conditions'. But there remained a lot to do to increase efficiency. Ford's fourth-quarter earnings at Dollars 1.30 a share compared with a Dollars 1.85 loss a year ago when the European operations took Dollars 419m of restructuring charges. Sales and revenues rose from Dollars 25.4bn to Dollars 27.84bn. The company had a one-time Dollars 73m gain in North America from the sale of its vehicle seating business, while overseas results were hit by a Dollars 109m restructuring charge at Jaguar and another of Dollars 57m in Australia. These were partially offset by a Dollars 59m reduction in German tax rates. For the full year, Ford reported earnings of Dollars 2.5bn, or Dollars 4.55 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 7.4bn, or Dollars 15.61 a share in 1992 which was due mainly to changes in accounting methods. Its automotive operations made Dollars 940m in 1993, compared with a Dollars 1.53bn loss the previous year, while financial services earned Dollars 1.59bn, up from Dollars 1.03bn.

We held talks  with Minister of Foreign Affairs Hikmet Cetin and Under  Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Ozdem Sanberk. One of the  issues we discussed was the relationship between Turkey and the  United States. In other words, we exchanged views on the new  kind of relations emerging between the two countries since the  cold war era ended. The matter came up when we were exchanging  views on whether or not the U.S. aid package for Turkey should  be rejected. That is currently an important issue on the  diplomatic back burner. A number of diplomats argue that it  should be immediately rejected.... Several others are inclined  to take a more professional approach on the matter. They  maintain that an effort should be made to find an approach more  effective than ostentatious and daring initiatives. Meanwhile,  several diplomats have described Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's  statement that her government may reject the conditional U.S.  aid as an example of diplomatic blunder.    As far as the U.S. aid package is concerned, the general  view  is that it should not be accepted if conditions are linked with  it.... However, the diplomatic struggle must be maintained  against this bias in the U.S. Congress.... Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin shares that view.    What can be done? It will be useful to discuss several  points before that question is considered. We still have the  old habbit of referring to what we receive from the United  States as U.S. aid. However, what we actually receive from that  country is not aid but credits in accordance with the existing  market conditions.... The U.S. Congress is gradually reducing  the U.S. aid package to foreign countries because the Soviet  Union has collapsed and the cold war has ended. The U.S.  military aid is expected to end in a few years.... That is why  the Turkish officials think like this: The aid is going to end.  Let us be the side which is more daring. The material aspect  of the matter is not important. Therefore, the aid package  should be rejected right now, at this moment.    Another reason put forward by those who support that view is  as follows: The anti-Turkish lobby in the United States--that  is, the Greek Cypriot, Greek, and Armenian lobbies--have  exploited the question of U.S. aid to Turkey for many years.  (The Serbs have now moved to support those lobbies) They have  harmed Turkey-U.S. relations by imposing conditions because of  the Cyprus problem and other issues. The rejection of the aid  will deprive them of their opportunity to harm Turkey.    The Human Rights Lobby    The general view among the Turkish Foreign Ministry  officials  is that the U.S. aid package cannot be accepted in its present  form, that is, with the conditions that have been linked to it  in connection with the Cyprus problem, human rights issues, and  the Kurdish problem. However, it is a fact that the rejection  of the aid package will not resolve the problem. Human rights  has been an important issue in the relations between Turkey and  the United States for several years. Therefore, even if  military aid is taken off the agenda, the question of human  rights will continue to be discussed in the congressional back  rooms. That point must always be kept in mind.    Even if Congress approves the conditional aid package to  Turkey, President Clinton is not expected to veto it. That  state of affairs will affect not only Turkey's relations with  the United States, but also with the European Countries.  Congress' decision will set an example for the European  countries on matters related to Cyprus, human rights, and the  Kurdish problem....    This matter should be considered calmly. The conditional  aid package should be rejected. However, that will not resolve  the problem. Looking at the relations between Turkey and the  United States only from that angle would be wrong. Let us  consider the matter from a wider perspective. Dangerous trends  -- such as chauvinism, extreme nationalist-conservative forces,  and religious trends -- are gradually strengthening in  Turkey.... Those forces must not be allowed to influence  Turkey's policy toward the United States and Europe. Turkey has  decided to join the European club. It is a member of the OECD,  NATO, the European Council, and CSCE. It is in the customs  union with the European Union. It is striving to take a place  among the top countries in the world, not the Third World  countries. Turning its back on the Western countries and  allowing its relations with the United States and Europe to  deteriorate would not be in Turkey's interest. Nor would it be  in its interest to close its doors to the outside world, concern  itself only with its own problems, and seek nonexistent horizons  because of the rhetoric that ""the Western countries do not like  us.""    It can be said that the same situation applies to the United  States and Europe from the geostrategic viewpoint. That is  true. Losing Turkey would not be in the interests of the United  States and Europe.... That, however, must not be exaggerated....    To See the Greatness....    What can be done under the existing conditions? It is  essential for Turkey to put its house in order. It has to  rectify its economy, improve its adherence to democracy,  separate the Kurdish problem from its struggle against the  Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], and take the necessary steps  in that regard from the point of view of democracy and human  rights....    Turkey has no alternative as the new century draws closer.  Turkey, which has a population of 60 million people, will draw  closer to the United States and Europe if it improves its  economy. The United States and Europe will regard Turkey as an  inalienable partner if it removes its deficiencies in applying  democratic principles and adhering to human rights.... Turkey  is a great country. Neither the PKK nor the Kurdish problem  should be allowed to influence its relations with the Western  countries. Let us hope that the officials have enough foresight  to realize its greatness.    In short, whether or not U.S. aid is rejected is not  important. Turkey has to have a broader concept of the future.     "
0,FT931-8592 ,"FT931-8592 _AN-DBRCKAE3FT 930218   FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Audi presses ahead with new models      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   AUDI, the luxury car division of Volkswagen, is pressing ahead with its ambitious development plans in spite a sharp reversal of fortunes this year. According to Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, 42, the company's new chairman, production will fall in 1993 by between 10 and 15 per cent because of falling domestic demand and the effects of the rise of the D-Mark on sales in important export markets such as Italy. The slump follows the sudden end of the boom last year, when Audi made 492,000 cars - 9.3 per cent more than in 1991 - and 'a good, positive operating profit,' Mr Kortum said yesterday. Full details would be announced in April, he added, although he admitted profits-to-sales ratios had suffered. Even so, projects for new models to extend the brand's appeal at both the top and lower ends of the market remain on schedule. A flagship V8-powered car with aluminium bodywork will be launched next spring, to be followed later in the decade by a new version of the old Audi 50 at the bottom of the range. The next key decision, which will be made this year, is whether to start manufacturing in the US. Possible sites are believed to have been narrowed down to two in Indiana and Kentucky. However, it is still possible that the hard-pressed parent company may choose the cheaper alternative of extending its existing VW works in Mexico. Mr Kortum - the successor to Mr Ferdinand Piech, who last month took charge at the parent group - is keen to rebuild Audi's reputation and position in the US market after years of decline. He can probably count on support from Mr Piech, who has publicly acknowledged that the dangers of failure in the US market include loss of ground elsewhere. In Mr Kortum's view, a north American plant is important to guarantee a place in the North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) and to ensure competitiveness with other Nafta-based manufacturers, be they Japanese or US-owned. Audi sales in the US have started to recover after falling from 75,000 in 1985 to around 12,000 in 1991. Following last year's increase to 14,800, the more recent past had seen a renewed 'decisive upwards trend' of 30 per cent monthly growth, Mr Kortum said. Sales promotions, including discounts and special service deals have also helped, but Audi models have been made more expensive by the recent depreciation of the dollar against the D-Mark.

0,FT942-3319 ,"FT942-3319 _AN-EFODGAD9FT 940615   FT  15 JUN 94 / Fugitive Botnar paid Pounds 3.8m - up 2,831%      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   Mr Octav Botnar, the chairman of Nissan UK for whom an arrest warrant has been outstanding for the past two-and-a-half years, was paid Pounds 3.81m last year. The emoluments - representing a 2,831 per cent rise from his previous year's pay of Pounds 130,000 - were for his role as chairman of Automotive Financial Group Holdings, which owns AFG, one of the UK's biggest motor dealers. Of the total remuneration, Pounds 3.7m is described as a 'bonus' paid by AFG. The figures appear in the latest annual report filed by AFGH for the year to July 1993. During the year AFGH's pre-tax profits fell by 73 per cent to Pounds 11m, from Pounds 40.5m. Turnover was down 23 per cent at Pounds 419.9m. An arrest warrant was issued in January 1992 for Mr Botnar, 80, who is alleged to have been the principal conspirator in the largest corporation tax fraud in UK history. The Inland Revenue was cheated of Pounds 55m by Nissan UK, the Botnar subsidiary which had imported and distributed Nissan cars until Nissan took over the role itself. In the most recent information filed at Companies House, Mr Botnar's 'usual residential address' is listed as Columbia Drive, Worthing, West Sussex, the headquarters of AFGH. He has failed to return to the UK for two-and-a-half years, preferring to live in Switzerland in a villa near Geneva. During his absence, two of his former colleagues have been jailed for their part in the fraud. Mr Michael Hunt, former Nissan UK managing director, was sentenced last summer to eight years and last month lost an appeal against conviction and sentence. Since he went to prison, Mr Hunt has become eligible to receive Pounds 1.06m as his latest dividend payment on his 10.6 per cent stake in AFGH. The Inland Revenue is seeking repayment of up to Pounds 238m from Nissan UK, which it claims is the company's tax liability for a period of 17 years in which it alleges that the company's profits were understated. Nissan UK has appealed against the tax assessment, and this appeal is expected to be heard by the Special Commissioners of the Inland Revenue later this year. The ultimate parent company of AFGH is the Bahamas-based GF International Finance and Investments, while Nissan UK Holdings' ultimate parent is the Panama-based European Motor Vehicles Corporation. Mr Botnar is chairman of both companies. AFG's results, Page 26   Companies:-  Automotive Financial Group Holdings.     Nissan UK.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT933-2583 ,"FT933-2583 _AN-DIQCFAAEFT 930917   FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: VW scuppers DM1.4bn Skoda deal      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN yesterday cancelled a complex DM1.4bn (Dollars 879m) investment financing package for Skoda, its Czech subsidiary, hours before the deal was due to be signed in London today. The move, which threatens to bring VW into conflict with the international banking community and worsen already-strained relations with the government of the Czech Republic, highlighted the intensity of the scramble to cut costs at the beleaguered automotive group. The package, negotiated with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, and a private banking consortium led by Dresdner Bank, was no longer needed, VW said. The participating banks, stunned by the news, offered no comment, but were hoping for a full explanation over dinner at the Mirabelle restaurant in London last night, arranged by Dresdner Bank and intended to celebrate the signing. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, was understood to be attending. He is believed to have telephoned Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, yesterday to assure him that VW's commitment to Skoda remained unaltered. It was not clear if the VW supervisory board, which must usually be consulted on important investment decisions, had been informed. 'It was an honest step, even though it was taken at short notice,' said Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs, a group spokesman. The company could have signed and then cancelled it, he added. He credited Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's controversial new production director, with improvements to manufacturing processes which had helped make the loan unnecessary. 'This is a positive move which will improve profitability both at Skoda and group level,' Mr Wachs added. Interim results of an investment review, due to be considered by the company's supervisory board in November, showed that productivity improvements at Skoda meant investment requirements would be 'considerably lower' than thought, the company said in a statement. Under current plans VW was expecting to spend a total of DM7bn at Skoda this decade, it added. It is understood that only around DM500m has been paid out this year. The planned total has been cut to around DM4bn. Volkswagen is already embroiled in a row with the Prague government which blew up last month when it announced an 8 per cent increase in Skoda prices in the Czech market and suggested it might import component supplies because of rising local costs. The prices of some Skoda models in the Czech republic are now around double the levels of three years ago, before VW took control.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Skoda Automobilova.

According to data collated by Automotive News, the US weekly, vehicle production in the US has risen by 13 per cent this year to 12.28m from 10.87m in 1993. Vehicle output in Japan has fallen by 2 per cent to 11m from 11.23m in 1993. Production in Japan has fallen for four years in succession under heavy pressure from the domestic recession and from declining exports. New vehicle registrations in Japan have shown the first signs of recovery in recent months, but, for the full year, vehicle output has fallen to the lowest level for 12 years. Production peaked at 13.49m in 1990 after first overtaking the US in 1980. In the US, vehicle production has risen rapidly during the past three years, matching the expansion in the domestic market. Output dropped to 8.8m in 1991, the low point of the last recession. It has risen by 39 per cent in the past three years to reach this year's level, however, and is forecast to increase further next year to top the previous record level of 12.899m, set in 1978. The new ascendancy of the US as the world's leading vehicle producer owes much to the restructuring of the world automotive industry over the past decade. Japanese vehicle producers have contributed greatly to the shifting balance by transferring more production out of Japan during the past 10 years, first to North America, and more recently to Europe and south-east Asia. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, the big three US car producers, have restructured drastically to regain world competitiveness and their fortunes have revived, but their domestic position is under challenge. About 15 per cent of US vehicle production is now coming from Japanese carmakers' plants - either wholly owned or in joint ventures - compared with nothing little more than a decade ago. Honda was the first Japanese vehicle maker to begin car assembly in the US in 1982. Japanese vehicle makers now operate 11 assembly plants and three engine plants in North America, and Honda is the leading US car exporter. Since the early 1980s, the Japanese have built in the US an auto industry larger than that of Britain or Italy or Spain. With its improved competitiveness, the North American auto industry is becoming a growing force in world auto markets, albeit from a small base.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

0,FT931-8551 ,"FT931-8551 _AN-DBRCKAF8FT 930218   FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium in cars 'to double'      By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent   ALUMINIUM USAGE by the car industry can be expected to more than double, from 2.4m tonnes in 1990 to 5.7m tonnes by 2006, according to the Commodities Research Unit consultancy organisation. Shipments of new or primary aluminium will rise at an even faster rate, from 770,000 tonnes to 2.8m tonnes, because of the development of 'all-aluminium' or 'aluminium-intensive' vehicles, it suggests in a new study. Some of the necessary aluminium smelting capacity is already in place but this market alone will call for five or six new smelters by 2006, the CRU points out. The trend will also increase demand for secondary (scrap) aluminium, put upward pressure on the price and increase the importance of the London Metal Exchange's new aluminium alloy contract, which can be used by manufacturers for hedging against price fluctuations. The CRU made a detailed, component by component analysis, and says that the increased use of aluminium will be mainly at the expense of steel and cast iron because the switch 'will be driven by the need to reduce the weight of cars and improve their fuel economy'. By 2006 the aluminium content of an average European car will have risen from 55 kg in 1990 to 98 kg. Usage in Japan and the US will almost double, says the CRU. Aluminium's relatively high price compared with that for steel will mean that it will be used most intensively in luxury cars, where buyers can afford to pay for it, and, later in this decade, in electric cars where weight savings will be essential. The study forecasts a growing use of aluminium 'space frames,' (skeleton-like car bodies) and aluminium hang-on and structural panels. But it sounds a note of caution about investment in aluminium rolling mills specifically for the car market. The CRU expects that improvements in plastics recyclability and recycling systems within the 15-year period, will enable plastic body panels to become highly competitive in non-load bearing applications and 'the window of growth for aluminium body panels will probably then be closed'. The study assumes a 1.8 per cent annual growth rate in car production and no further oil price shocks. 'Any sharp rise in the oil price, or much more stringent legislation on fuel economy in the US and elsewhere, would considerably increase future demand for aluminium from the car industry,' it concludes.

'It is apparent that our investment plans for Skoda will change substantially,' he said. Volkswagen yesterday had been due to sign the DM1.4bn Skoda project finance facility, the biggest yet planned for east Europe, with a banking group led by the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The four lead commercial banks were Dresdner and Deutsche banks, J. P. Morgan, and CS First Boston. 'It was the more honest and professional thing to do - to call off the deal, rather than have all the banks come and sign - when we know that the investment plans in the prospectus documents will change dramatically,' said Mr Reisch. 'It was the lesser of two evils to call off the deal at short notice.' The treasurer himself was only informed on Thursday morning by the group's management board that the financing deal, which had been under negotiation for nearly two years, was to be abandoned. Mr Reisch was unable to provide any detail of how VW now planned to proceed with the development of Skoda, in which it is acquiring a majority 70 per cent stake. VW had planned to spend DM7bn over 10 years at Skoda. This would have been to double its production capacity to more than 400,000 cars a year, to modernise its facilities, and to renew its products with the addition of a second car range. With VW suffering from heavy losses and sharply declining sales, Mr Reisch said the group's investment plans were now 'in flux'. 'The whole expenditure process is being restructured and reviewed. This is a huge task that proceeds at an enormous pace, but it still takes time to run through all the elements,' he said. He did not expect the move to have a detrimental effect on VW's banking relationships. The surprise of London bankers at VW's withdrawal from the financing deal was mirrored by the Czech government and Skoda itself. Skoda executives said yesterday they had been informed the deal was off less than 24 hours before the planned signing. Mr Jiri Hrabovsky, Skoda spokesman, insisted the company still planned to double production to around 450,000 cars a year by 1997.   Companies:-  Skoda Automobilova.     Volkswagen.

0,FT932-8181 ,"FT932-8181 _AN-DETCAABUFT 930520   FT  20 MAY 93 / Ford losses force cuts in RD restructuring plan      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   FORD's continuing losses in Europe have forced the US-based vehicle maker to scale back its ambitious plan for restructuring its European research and development operations. It is reducing the number of jobs to be transferred from the UK to Germany and is to keep open its Aveley engineering site in Essex, which had been earmarked for closure. Ford announced a year ago that it planned to consolidate its UK and German design and production engineering operations at two sites - Dunton, Essex, and Merkenich, near Cologne. The company said yesterday, however, that it had reviewed the plan 'to ensure that every element of proposed expenditure is absolutely justified in the light of our present business situation'. Ford's European automotive operations, including Jaguar, made a record loss last year of Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 840m) compared with a loss of Dollars 1.079bn in 1991. The European operations are being drastically restructured, with about 10,000 job losses in Ford of Europe (excluding Jaguar) announced last year. In spite of earlier optimism about returning to break-even this year Ford this week admitted that 'as economic conditions have developed, it is increasingly unlikely that the company's European operations will return to profitability in 1993'. Aveley will keep its pilot plant and manufacturing and process-engineering workshop facilities. The 'likely benefits' of consolidating the operation at Dunton were 'outweighed by the substantial costs involved', the company said. Under the revised plan for reorganising research and development the number of jobs to be transferred from the UK to Germany has been reduced to 226 from 309 a year ago. The jobs are in chassis engineering, body engineering and transmission operations. The number of jobs being moved from Germany to the UK, in instrument panel engineering, has been cut to 22 from 26. Ford said yesterday that 776 jobs would now be moved to the Dunton technical centre. Of these 346 would come from Aveley, 172 from Dagenham and 258 from Basildon. About 400 jobs will remain at Aveley. Ford said the scaling back of the plan had not compromised its aim of locating its design and manufacturing engineering staffs at only two locations in the UK and Germany. The moves were aimed at improving the efficiency of the operations through increasing use of simultaneous engineering - involving both design and manufacturing engineers in project teams. The company will remain at a disadvantage against its rivals in Europe by having these functions divided.   Companies:-  Ford Motor.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

Honda saw consolidated revenues in the three months ended June fall by 17 per cent to Y919.6bn (Dollars 8.9bn) compared with Y1,112bn previously. Pre-tax profits fell to Y15.3bn, or less than half their previous level of Y34.2bn. Honda said it had been severely affected by the sharp rise of the yen which hit profits in its largest markets overseas, particularly the US, where it sold more cars than in its home market. The company is re-examining its forecast of Y4,000bn in revenues for the entire year, which was made on expectations of an average yen-dollar exchange rate at Y115 to the dollar. The yen has recently been fluctuating closer to a rate of Y103 to the dollar. The rise of the yen's value has already led to a loss of Y25bn, even after taking into effect any gains made from hedging, Honda said. Motorcycle sales were firm in unit terms, rising 12 per cent from the first quarter of last year. However, due to the impact of the higher yen, sales in the division were 2.6 per cent lower at Y146bn. Honda has seen strong demand for its motorcycles in the US and Asia, excluding Japan. Demand in the US rose strongly as Honda has offered more higher value-added models while growth in Asia was spurred as incomes in the region have risen. Car sales fell 21 per cent in value terms to Y704.9bn and 11 per cent in unit terms, reflect-ing the continued weakness of demand in all of Honda's leading markets outside of the Asian region, excluding Japan. 'The current level of the yen will make it very difficult for us to carry out our operations,' Honda said. It has been forced to raise US prices once this year and would suffer if it raised them again. Honda expects to shift more production overseas. Exports from its US facilities, which could step up capacity, could increase in future not only to Japan where its US-made Accord is selling well, but to other parts of the world. The company has implemented cost-cutting efforts, reduced one of its lines in Japan to one shift, cut seasonal workers by about half and transferred some car staff to motorcycle operations.

0,FT931-11547 ,"FT931-11547 _AN-DBBCMAB2FT 930202   FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Accounting change leads to Dollars 20.8bn charge for GM      By MARTIN DICKSON      NEW YORK   GENERAL Motors, the struggling US carmaker, announced last night that it would take a Dollars 20.8bn after-tax charge to comply with a new standard of accounting for the post-retirement health benefits of employees. The company also announced it would be taking a much larger-than-expected fourth-quarter charge relating to its plan to sell a significant proportion of its stake in National Car Rental Systems. This is now expected to work through at Dollars 744m after tax. The company previously suggested a Dollars 300m charge might be necessary. It said the increase related primarily to the write-off of goodwill on NCRS' books. All US companies have to adopt the new accounting standard, but GM's charge is expected to be by far the biggest of any corporation, because of both the company's size and the age profile of its workforce. GM stressed that the charge - which works through at Dollars 33.38 a share, and will be applied retroactively to January last year - is a non-cash item which will not affect the company's cash flow or ability to pay dividends. However, it will cause a major dent in the equity on the company's balance sheet. The accounting standard, FASB 106, involves changing from a system of recognising the cost of retiree health benefits when the money is paid out, to a system of recognising the expense when the obligation is incurred. Companies could choose either take a charge for catching up on past obligations in one go, as GM has done, or amortise the cost over 20 years. Mr Richard Wagoner, chief financial officer, said GM had decided on a one-time charge. Companies also have an additional ongoing annual charge, which GM said would amount to Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 2.05 a share, in 1992. The size of the charge was no surprise to Wall Street, since GM had signalled that it faced an obligation of roughly this size. The only question was whether it would take it in one go, or over 20 years. Mr Wagoner said GM continued to be encouraged by recent trends in its loss-making North American operations and continued to aim for break-even there in 1993 before interest, tax and FASB 106 expenses. GM yesterday also elected two new non-executive board members: Dr Louis Sullivan, president of the Morehouse college school of medicine who was health secretary under President Bush; and Mr John Bryan, chairman of foods group Sara Lee.

The two moves spell good news for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. His standing in the opinion polls - a key element in any decision he takes to contest next year's presidential election - recently rallied slightly, after a steady drop in the wake of his controversial and abortive attempts at labour market reform, In making its fifth small interest rate cut in a month and so tracking the monetary easing in Germany, the Bank of France also reduced its higher 'repurchase' rate by 0.35 of a percentage point to 6.40 per cent. Societe Generale and Banque Nationale de Paris yesterday led a move by commercial banks to trim their base rate from 7.95 to 7.7 per cent. Insee, the statistics agency, had in March forecast that growth in the six months of this year would be 0.7 per cent above that of the last half of 1993. Insee economists said yesterday that even in the unlikely event that economic recovery flattened out entirely in the second half of 1994, the 'carry over' effect of first half growth would put year-on-year growth for 1994 at 1.3 per cent, in line with the government's own target. The statistics agency also said it was effectively scrapping its December 1993 forecast that the unemployment rate would rise by a further 0.5 percentage point this year, as the jobless rate has stuck at 12.2 per cent since the start of the year. Several thousand public employees demonstrated yesterday in Paris against possible restructuring moves, even though Mr Balladur has decreed a freeze on public sector redundancies. The three major factors in recovery, according to Insee, have been: Increased demand for consumer goods, led by the 40 per cent rise in car sales between January and April. This was largely due to special government financial incentives for car purchases, but Insee now sees higher foreign demand for French cars. A stabilisation in industrial producer prices, whose fall last year led French companies to get rid of stocks of declining value. But consumer price inflation, which hit an historic annual low of 1.5 per cent in March, is predicted to remain low, an expectation the Bank of France shares.

The UK operations would not be transferred to the new company. Much of UK operating capacity, which employs 5,500 people, could close. Bankers said yesterday that the main truck plant at Leyland in Lancashire may be sold to management, but that the Birmingham van plant and the Glasgow axle plant were at risk. They added that Daf's administrators working under Dutch insolvency law, together with local bankers and government officials, were working on the demerger proposal. It also emerged yesterday that before seeking bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, Daf had been planning to withdraw from all van manufacturing. The Birmingham van plant employs 2,000 people. Under the original restructuring plan, Daf would have concentrated on the manufacture of heavy and medium-sized trucks. It would have attempted to find a partner for the manufacture of light trucks, at present assembled at the Leyland plant with 2,200 employees. Bankers said yesterday they believed MAN of Germany was the best partner for Daf in light trucks and hoped that talks between the two companies could be pursued. Daf's restructuring plan was based in part on an investigation by the management consulting firm AD Little, backed up by financial estimates from accountants Coopers  Lybrand. A confidential study by Coopers estimated that Daf's losses in 1992 were more than Fl 800m (Pounds 296m). This included a Fl 580m provision to cover restructuring costs. Coopers and Daf also estimated that Daf needed to raise finance of Fl 800m in 1993, followed by Fl 500m the following year and Fl 250m in 1995. These funds would have had to be provided by the company's banks, its holders of preference shares and debentures, together with the Dutch government and the Flemish regional authorities. Any demerger would need to be approved by the group's banks, principally a consortium of nine led by the Dutch bank, ABN Amro, which is the biggest lender to Daf. A formal proposal should be put in the next three weeks, a banker said. Daf confirmed yesterday that it had received a short-term bridging loan from its banks and the Dutch government to allow it to continue trading for a month. It has received a loan of more than Fl 100m, including Fl 60m from the banking consortium. The Daf crisis, Page 7   Companies:-  DAF.     Leyland DAF.   Countries:-  NLZ  Netherlands, EC.

0,FT941-13852 ,"FT941-13852 _AN-EAXCSAAEFT 940124   FT  24 JAN 94 / VW chief may sue over 'concealed' losses at Seat      By PETER BRUCE and CHRISTOPHER PARKES      MADRID, FRANKFURT   Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, has threatened possible legal action against former managers of Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, for allegedly concealing immense losses that drove the whole group into a DM2.3bn (Pounds 890m) deficit last year. A meeting on June 23 of Seat's supervisory board, which includes VW executives, was told the subsidiary would make a DM150m loss, Mr Piech said in an interview with El Pas, the Spanish daily newspaper, yesterday. Since then, group auditors had discovered that Seat's management had been presented one day earlier with a report from Mr Eberhardt Muller, then finance director, warning that the company was technically bankrupt because its 1993 losses would exceed its capital of Pta80bn, about DM1bn. Mr Piech indirectly accused Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, former Seat chairman, of concealing the truth: 'Personally, and this has to be proven, I believe at least three people on the management board of Seat must have known about the report.' Mr Daz was dismissed last September. Since then, VW has confirmed Seat lost DM1.4bn in 1993. Restructuring costs, including closure of a Barcelona factory, are estimated at a further DM800m. From a German point of view, the DM150m loss estimate issued on June 23 was deliberate misinformation. For Mr Piech, that was 'an action that could have penal consequences'. VW said independent auditors had been appointed to investigate, and that decisions on possible consequences, including legal action, would have to wait until they had reported. Mr Piech, whose career so far as VW chairman has been blighted by the criminal investigation of his new production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and the Seat crisis, also forecast further losses in the first quarter of the current year. But he told a German newspaper the deficit would be a fraction of the DM1.25m loss booked in the same period of 1993, and that the group would return to profit by the year's end. Seat was the only subsidiary expected to remain in loss, with a deficit of DM200m, he said. The group's forecasts of a return to health are based partly on the planned introduction of shorter working time at its six German factories. VW has claimed the so-called 'four-day week' scheme would save it DM1.8bn a year in labour costs. However, details of the controversial plan are yet to be agreed with social security officials and trade unions. US carmakers see off foreign competitors, Page 3   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

0,FT944-18708 ,"FT944-18708 _AN-EJCE7AA3FT 941003   FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Gatt ruling on vehicle taxes goes against EU      By FRANCES WILLIAMS and NANCY DUNNE      GENEVA, WASHINGTON   A dispute settlement panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has ruled in favour of the US on most of the EU complaints brought against US laws regulating vehicle fuel economy and luxury taxes. The decision is also a setback for US opponents of the new Uruguay Round deal, who have argued that the 'faceless bureaucrats' in Geneva will force the US to change environmental and consumer laws. The panel ruled in the EU's favour on one issue - that accounting rules, established under the US Corporate Average Fuel Economy law (Cafe) were inconsistent with Gatt. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said he would not ask Congress to change the rules, as they 'do not have any actual economic impact on EU auto manufacturers and therefore no trade damage results'. In a written statement, US officials said Gatt had found for the first time that conservation measures 'could excuse a country's law that was otherwise inconsistent with the Gatt'. Gatt set up an independent disputes panel in May 1993 to examine the EU's allegation that US car taxes discriminate against European exports. The EU claimed European car makers were paying a disproportionate share of the three taxes - two of which penalise high fuel consumption, while the third is a luxury tax on cars costing over Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 19,000). Brussels had said the total revenue of the three taxes levied in 1991 was Dollars 558m, of which Dollars 494m fell on European cars. European manufacturers paid 100 per cent of penalties under the Cafe law, 80 per cent of the 'gas-guzzler' tax, and 80 per cent of the luxury tax. European cars had just 4 per cent of the US car market. The EU argued that Cafe payments in discriminated against European luxury car makers, as they were based on the sales-weighted average fuel consumption of all models produced. Thus US producers who make cars in a range of sizes, and Japanese makers of mostly small, fuel-efficient cars, do not incur penalties. The Cafe limits for company cars set an average fleet standard of 27.5 miles per gallon (8.8 litres per 100km) and vehicles with a worse mileage are taxed. The 'gas-guzzler' tax penalises other passenger cars that achieve less than 22.5 mpg. Friends of the Earth in Washington, an environmental group, says the Cafe law has led to savings of over 2.5m barrels of oil a day.   Countries:-  CHZ  Switzerland, West Europe.

The possibility of also  using it to detect the causative agents of dangerous infectious  diseases has also been demonstrated in principle (V.S. Rybkin,  1983; G.M. Orlova et al., 1986; Yu.A. Belaya, 1987; T.M.  Grizhebovskiy, et al., 1987; O.V. Sivkova, 1988). Our industry  does not produce the respective diagnosticums, however. Such  preparations are also needed to detect and identify isolated  cultures and conduct accelerated analyses, especially under  field conditions, in emergencies, and during mass studies.    This communication is devoted to the development of plague  tularemia, cholera, glanders, and melioidosis dry  coagglutinating diagnosticums and to the study of their use in  different stages of bacteriologic investigation.    Vaccine and virulent strains of bacteria of the respective  species were used to prepare the antigens in the experiments,  and strains of various heterologous microorganisms were used to  study the resultant preparations' specificity. The optimum  schemes of producing rabbit immune sera were selected for each  diagnosticum. Dry commercial staphylococcal reagent (produced by  the Leningrad Epidemiology and Microbiology Scientific Research  Institute imeni Pasteur) were sensitized by using native sera in  accordance with recommendations. The amount of sensitizing agent  and duration of sensitization were selected individually for  each diagnosticum. For a working dilution, researchers used a  dilution equal to half the maximum resulting in a preparation  efficiently agglutinating homologous antigens.    The liquid diagnosticums were lyophilized in a  saccharose-gelatin medium. Equipment produced by Friger  (Czechosolvakia) was used.    When setting up the reaction, researchers applied a drop of  prepared microbial suspension onto clean degreased glass, added  a drop of dissolved preparation, mixed it, and examined it  against a dark background. They checked for the absence of  spontaneous agglutination of the diagnosticum and suspension of  study cultures. The result was calculated over 5 minutes; a  response to 4+ and 3+ was considered positive.    Three versions of plague diagnosticums were developed on the  basis of different sera, i.e., diagnosticums to whole live  microbial cells of the vaccine strain EV 1290, to the somatic  antigen (fraction V) of the acapsular atoxic version of the same  strain, and to fraction I of Yersinia pestis. The  specific activity of these preparations was studied in  experiments on 80 capsular and 14 acapsular strains of plague  microbe grown at 28 and 37ëC. The first preparation  agglutinated bacteria of the homologous type of typical and  atypical acapsular strains in a concentration of 10[.sup]7[/]  microbe cells/ml and higher. The activity of the second  preparation was on the same level; however, the formation of  finer agglutinate with incomplete clarification of the fluid was  frequently observed. The third preparation detected only  capsular versions of plague causative agent. The reaction was  clearer with bacteria grown at 37ëC, and its sensitivity  reached 10[.sup]6[/] microbe cells/ml with selected strains.  Only the third preparation possessed strict species specificity,  whereas the first and second preparations also reacted with  selected strains of pseudotuberculosis causative agent.    Several versions of group-specific cholera diagnosticums  with  various characteristics in relation to Vibrio  cholerae 01 and non-01 were prepared. The rabbits were  immunized by intravenous injection of suspensions of daily  cultures of different strains of V. cholerae 01  subjected to prolonged boiling. Conditions to produce a highly  specific preparation were selected. Reaction sensitivity ranged  from 10[.sup]6[/] to 10[.sup]8[/] microbe cells/ml  depending on the strain. Coagglutination was not observed with  V. cholerae non-01. The diagnosticum's high  specificity during identification of cultures isolated during  the 1990 cholera outbreak was demonstrated.    To obtain a tularemia diagnosticum, animals were immunized  with a 3x intravenous suspension of formalin-killed  Francisella tularensis of the vaccine strain 15. In a  study of five series of preparation using 96 strains of  tularemia causative agent, including freshly isolated agent, the  sensitivity of reaction with formalin-treated suspensions ranged  from 10 to 10[.sup]-1[/] units based on standard turbidity  and from 10 to 10[.sup]-2[/] units with boiling. With  heterologous strains of different species of bacteria, no  positive reaction was noted.    The antigen relationship of the causative agents of glanders  and melioidosis and their serological cross-reactions make  identification and differentiation of these bacteria difficult.  Immune sera obtained to corpuscular antigens of each of the  species agglutinated bacteria of both species. Cross-reactions  were successfully eliminated by adsorbing melioidosis serum with  glanders antigen, whereas depletion of glanders serum by  melioidosis bacteria resulted in a loss of its activity. The  melioidosis diagnosticum thus acquired strict species  specificity, whereas the glanders diagnosticum agglutinated  bacteria of both homologous strains and most strains of  melioidosis causative agent. The reaction's sensitivity ranged  from 10[.sup]7[/] to 10[.sup]9[/] microbe cells/ml.  Simultaneous use of the two diagnosticums during serologic  identification of the causative agents of melioidosis and  glanders makes it possible to differentiate the species.    In a study of the reaction of coagglutination of individual  colonies grown on dense culture media or elective colonies with  seeding of pure or mixed cultures, the diagnosticums clearly  detected the respective colonies, which permitted rapid  serologic identification and a reduction in analysis time. In a  study of coagglutination reactions, the biological material of  animals containing tularemia causative agent were subjected to  boiling and centrifugation. This eliminated nonspecific  reactions, and in all cases, tularemia antigen was detected in a  suspension of the organs of animals that had died after  infection. The tularemia diagnosticum was used in studying field  material during epizooty of this infection. The positive results  in the coagglutination reaction were always confirmed by  isolating cultures. No false-positive reactions were observed.  The possibility of detecting cholera vibrios in feces and the  possibility of detecting the causative agents of glanders and  melioidosis in mixed cultures after enrichment of the material  on elective media were demonstrated under experimental  conditions.    The set of dry coagglutinating diagnosticums consisting of  plague, tularemia, cholera, glanders, and melioidosis  preparations that was developed may be recommended for  identifying cultures, screening colonies, and detecting  causative agents in biological material and in an external  medium during an accelerated analysis process, as well as in  quick analysis.

Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW group chairman, said in an interview with the FT that the company was planning to move to a system in which some of its leading suppliers became 'logistical partners'. These first tier suppliers would take over responsibility for supplying complete modules rather than individual components. 'Around the year 2000 our group will have 100-200 logistical partners. Toyota has 220 logistical partners today,' said Mr Piech. At present the VW division alone had 1,500 suppliers and Audi, the group's executive car division had around 800. Mr Piech said Audi currently had around 22 suppliers providing components for a complete dashboard and instrument panel, which were assembled in the car plant. 'We are beginning to plan for one of the 22 to become responsible for the logistics of the other 21 suppliers, and this partner would supply a complete module,' he said. Since the arrival of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from General Motors as the VW group director for purchasing and production, VW has started to build a global purchasing organisation with the aim of cutting costs and reducing dependence on its high cost German supply base. Volkswagen has created seven purchasing centres around the world, said Mr Frans Boot, head of the recently established VW group purchasing office in the UK. The groups have been set up in Wolfsburg, Germany, with responsibility for purchasing from suppliers in northern Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East, in Ingolstadt with responsibility for southern Germany, Austria and Italy, and in Mlada Boleslav in the Czech Republic for eastern Europe. A group purchasing office had been set up in Barcelona with responsibility for Spain, Portugal and South America, in Detroit with responsibility for the US, Canada and Mexico, in Brussels for the Benelux countries and France and in Milton Keynes for the UK and Ireland. The regional purchasing offices have been set up to serve all four of the group's brand divisions, Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda, and under the Lopez system all the groups will be seeking to scour their regions for lower cost suppliers at high levels of quality and service. Mr Boot said that the group was seeking to standardise many components across model ranges.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

The company, formed in the late 1980s from the former loss-making Bedford van operations in Luton, more than tripled turnover to Pounds 426m, compared with Pounds 133.7m. Production was more than doubled to 48,452 (20,932) vehicles as a result of the successful build-up of output of the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera four wheel drive leisure utility vehicle. The ranges produced by IBC are based on Japanese technology from Isuzu and Suzuki. GM holds minority equity stakes in both companies. GM has, however, decided to halt production of the Suzuki-derived range of microvans at IBC from the end of June following a collapse in demand. Production of the small vans has plunged from 21,500 in 1989 to 5,652 last year, and output has been cut to only 1,790 in the first half of this year. Vauxhall sales of the Rascal van in the UK dropped last year to only 2,478 from 8,274 in 1990. The market for Japanese-designed microvans has shrunk dramatically, and GM is hoping that it can meet residual demand through the forthcoming launch of its new Corsa high-roof van. As the Rascal is withdrawn other competition is coming into the market, however, with the launch by Daihatsu of its Italian-built Hijet microvan, which is being assembled at a joint venture plant at Pontedera, Tuscany with Piaggio of Italy. GM is planning to keep the Midi panel van in production at IBC at least until 1995-96, but it is in negotiations with other vanmakers in Europe about collaboration on a new vehicle range to replace the ageing Midi in the second half of the 1990s. The future of the IBC operation is now tied closely to the production of four wheel drive leisure utility vehicles; output of the Frontera is planned to increase from 31,436 last year to 42-45,000 in 1993. The company has reached agreement with trade unions for the introduction of a third shift at the plant, if this can be justified by higher demand for the four wheel drive vehicles, which have succeeded so far in defying the steep fall in demand for new cars in western Europe.

The report, published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, was based on 30 industrial sectors. It found that 'at the level of individual manufacturing industries, Germany does not so clearly dominate Britain, except in the period from 1973 to 1979. 'Almost half the industries showed a superior British productivity growth performance over the entire three decades to 1989,' it added. The report said that in 1989, 23 industries had higher productivity levels in Germany than in Britain, whereas in 1960 Germany had an advantage in only 17 industries. German manufacturing productivity peaked in superiority in 1979, when only three industries performed better in Britain - leather and footwear; drink and tobacco production. In 1960 labour productivity was only 4 percentage points higher in Germany than in Britain; by 1973 the gap had widened to 19.4 and six years later to 40 per cent. But by 1989 the difference had narrowed to 16.5 percentage points. The study calculates that aggregate labour productivity growth in Germany from 1960 to 1989 was 'a little less than half a percentage point higher per year than in Britain'. However, only six out of the 30 industries covered had a lower productivity performance in Germany than in Britain in 1989. These were mineral products; iron and steel; office machinery; electrical engineering; drink and tobacco production. In 1960, 13 out of the 30 industries had a better level of labour productivity in Britain. The largest productivity gap in 1989 was in the printing, publishing and paper industries where Germany was more than 50 per cent more productive. German dominance was also clear in ceramic goods manufacture; mechanical engineering; vehicle production and instrument engineering. The report attributes the better UK performance in the 1980s to the labour market freeing itself 'from the worst forms of restrictive practices'. The report adds that Britain still lags in the number of manufacturing workers with skills; in the volume of resources devoted to research and development; and in investment in new plant and machinery. The study found that in 1989 Germany had 30 per cent more physical capital per worker-hour in manufacturing than Britain. Changing Fortunes. NIESR No7. Pounds 11.50.

This has flared up over alleged industrial espionage by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's production and purchasing director and formerly GM's global purchasing director. In a statement last night GM said Mr Smith and Mr Piech had held only a 'brief' telephone conversation yesterday. 'No face-to-face meetings were scheduled between the two executives.' At the same time GM moved to force Mr Piech into a public climbdown over his implied allegations last week that the US company might have tampered with evidence and might have planted secret information in VW's computer system. Mr David Herman, chairman and managing director of Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, called last night for Mr Piech to 'retract in detail the false public accusations' he made last week, only a day before contacting GM to seek discussions with Mr Smith. Mr Herman said he was prepared to 'communicate in writing with Volkswagen executives', but only on condition that such contact did not bias the public prosecutor's investigation of the alleged industrial espionage by Mr Lopez and other former GM employees, and provided Mr Piech issued his retraction. Mr Herman said that, last week, 'without presenting evidence of any kind', Mr Piech had 'implied that Opel/GM could have tampered with evidentiary material in the Lopez case; that Opel/GM were abusing the public prosecutor's office to the defamation of Volkswagen; and that Opel/GM or their agents might have gained access to the VW computer system in order to place secret information there that could implicate Volkswagen.' Mr Herman said all of the charges were 'absolutely false, and if Mr Piech believed otherwise his simple remedy would have been to present evidence. . . to the prosecutor's office'. The Opel chairman called on Volkswagen to co-operate with the criminal investigation 'by making all material VW witnesses immediately available for interview by the prosecutors'. The extreme language used by Mr Piech last week against General Motors has caused unease in Bonn. Calls from German government ministers for moderation appeared to trigger Mr Piech's initiative to make direct contact with Mr Smith. Mr Herman expressed astonishment last night that VW had announced the initiative without prior knowledge or approval by Opel or GM in the US. He said 'such unilateral action could be interpreted as a mere tactical manoeuvre'.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

The company also announced it would be taking a much larger-than-expected fourth-quarter charge relating to its plan to sell a significant proportion of its stake in National Car Rental Systems. This is now expected to work through at Dollars 744m after tax. The company previously suggested a Dollars 300m charge might be necessary. It said the increase related primarily to the write-off of goodwill on NCRS' books. All US companies have to adopt the new accounting standard, but GM's charge is expected to be by far the biggest of any corporation, because of both the company's size and the age profile of its workforce. GM stressed the charge - which works through at Dollars 33.38 a share, and will be applied retroactively to January last year - is a non-cash item which will not affect the company's cash flow or ability to pay dividends. However, it will cause a major dent in the equity on the company's balance sheet. The accounting standard, FASB 106, involves changing from a system of recognising the cost of retiree health benefits when the money is paid out, to a system of recognising the expense when the obligation is incurred. Companies could choose either take a charge for catching up on past obligations in one go, as GM has done, or amortise the cost over 20 years. Mr Richard Wagoner, chief financial officer, said GM had decided on a one-time charge. Companies also have an additional ongoing annual charge, which GM said would amount to Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 2.05 a share, in 1992. The size of the charge was no surprise to Wall Street, since GM had signalled that it faced an obligation of roughly this size. The only question was whether it would take it in one go, or over 20 years. Mr Wagoner said GM continued to be encouraged by recent trends in its loss-making North American operations and continued to aim for break-even there in 1993 before interest, tax and FASB 106 expenses. GM also elected two new non-executive board members: Dr Louis Sullivan, president of the Morehouse college school of medicine who was health secretary under President Bush; and Mr John Bryan, chairman of foods group Sara Lee.

0,FT941-8153 ,"FT941-8153 _AN-EBVDKAA1FT 940222   FT  22 FEB 94 / Rover and Honda - Going Their Own Ways: Government comes under pressure to intervene      By ROLAND RUDD   The government was yesterday under pressure from some of its own backbenchers to encourage Honda to continue its collaboration with Rover. Angry calls for intervention from Tory MPs are likely to dismay ministers, who only a few weeks ago were privately expressing relief that Rover's sale to BMW had not caused a political row. Sir Teddy Taylor, (Southend East), said: 'Honda has been treated shamefully. A minister should now make a public statement saying the government regrets the way the sale of Rover to BMW has been handled to alleviate the problem.' Another senior backbencher said the Department of Trade and Industry 'should start batting for Britain' by encouraging the Japanese to guarantee a long-term working relationship with Rover. However, Downing Street dismissed calls for intervention arguing that it was not a matter for the prime minister. It was made clear that Mr John Major hopes that co-operation will continue between Honda and Rover, but does not share the 'apocalyptic vision' of those who fear a speedy end to the relationship. However, Mr Simon Coombs, (Swindon) warned that a decision by Honda to sever all its links with Rover could prove very damaging. Although Honda stressed that the 2,000 jobs at its plant in Swindon would not be affected by its decision to sell its 20 per cent Rover stake, Mr Coombs said an end to joint contracts would affect many of his constituents reliant on Honda. He has already asked Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, to find out why there was no British company interested in buying the country's last car volume manufacturer. There is deep unease among backbenchers that Honda's decision to sell its stake in Rover could herald the end of the relationship between the two companies. There is also concern that it could harm Britain's chances of continuing to receive the biggest share of Japanese inward investment in Europe. The UK accounts for 40 per cent of all Japanese European investment, according to government figures. 'We now know that Honda are deeply distressed' said Sir Teddy. 'If its not to have an affect on Japanese inward investment, the government must make a statement'. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry spokesman, called on ministers to live up to their promise that Rover and its workforce would not suffer from the BMW takeover. 'The danger for Rover is that customers will lose confidence and the workforce will lose morale if the uncertainty is not ended swiftly,' he said.   Companies:-  Honda Motor.     Rover Group.

0,FT933-13158 ,"FT933-13158 _AN-DGUCEABCFT 930721   FT  21 JUL 93 / Riot police sent to end Hyundai dispute: Seoul's tough stance on industrial unrest      By JOHN BURTON   THE South Korean government yesterday demanded that workers at Hyundai Motor suspend their industrial action immediately and sent riot police to enforce the order. The swift intervention is meant to end the 46 days of labour strife that has disrupted South Korea's biggest industrial conglomerate. Hyundai Motor is the largest of the nine Hyundai companies still affected by stoppages that began in early June. Hyundai estimates that it has lost Won390bn (Pounds 326m) in sales as a result of the partial strikes at the country's leading vehicle maker. This accounts for two-thirds of total losses in turnover suffered by Hyundai during the dispute, while total production losses amount to Won1,230bn, including business lost by 2,500 subcontractors mostly affiliated with Hyundai Motor. In targeting Hyundai Motor, the government hopes to persuade workers at the other striking Hyundai companies to settle their dispute over pay and working conditions and return to work. The government invoked its emergency powers to intervene because it fears that the continuing labour conflict could affect Korea's economic recovery by reducing exports. Officials estimate that the country has already lost almost Won250bn in exports, mainly motor vehicles, due to the strike. Although Hyundai Motor workers had resumed normal schedules late last week in a conciliatory gesture to management, they threatened to resume partial strikes today and stage a general strike on Friday if no progress was achieved in negotiations. Hyundai Motor workers are now barred from staging any form of industrial action until August 8, while the government mediates in the dispute, possibly imposing a settlement. As many as 10,000 police are being deployed to Ulsan - the south-eastern city where Hyundai Motor and the other Hyundai companies are located - to suppress any strike activity. A clash between workers and riot police would be highly embarrassing for the new democratic government of Mr Kim Young-sam, who promised labour reforms when he took office five months ago. The use of emergency powers already represents a setback for the government's labour policy, which was based on negotiations between labour and management without any government interference. It is only the second time the government has resorted to using emergency powers to end a labour dispute, the first having occurred in 1969. But police were frequently used to suppress strikes during the military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s.   Companies:-  Hyundai Motor.   Countries:-  KRZ  South Korea, Asia.

Output of BMW models, hampered by retooling for new models, rose 3 per cent to 285,000 units, while deliveries to customers increased 5 per cent to 291,500. Turnover climbed 7.4 per cent to DM15.8bn. The newly-acquired Rover group also worked at the limits of its capacity to deliver 234,600 vehicles - a 16 per cent improvement on the first half of 1993, BMW said. No financial details for Rover were included in the report. Although the company provided no clear forecasts for the full year, apart from predicting higher deliveries and production, it suggested the early pace would slow. In the US, where first-half sales of BMWs rose 13 per cent to 41,700, it expected overall demand for passenger cars to continue increasing but at a lower rate than the 8 per cent recorded in the period to the end of June. The company was concerned at the strength of the D-Mark, which 'could bring into question the expected economic recovery', it said. Lower growth rates were likely in western Europe, where price cuts, cheap special models and government-funded measures to encourage people to buy new cars, had lifted overall registrations 7 per cent to 6.5m units in the first half. BMW sales in the region rose 2 per cent to 201,200 cars. Registrations in Germany increased only slightly to 116,000. In Japan, the marque's sales rose 15 per cent to 14,700 units, in spite of a clear fall in overall demand for quality cars. Although the Japanese market had stopped declining, an increase in overall registrations was not to be expected before 1995, BMW said. In an enthusiastic review of the Rover purchase, the report said sales in mainland European countries had 'almost without exception', grown by more than 10 per cent. The introduction of the Land Rover Discovery to the US in April had helped double sales of Land Rover vehicles there to 4,500. The company's motor cycle business reported a 35 per cent rise in deliveries during the review period to 29,300. Production of two-wheelers, including assembly in Italy of the new F650 single-cylinder model, increased 11.5 per cent to 24,240.

The Rumble  of Boots: Vivid Episodes From Market Competition""]    [Text] Although the Russian market in plastic money will be  25 years old this year, the stormiest events in it did not  unfold until 1992-1993, when real competition among payment  systems and numerous commercial structures emerged here. And in  literally the past few months the competition in the Russian  electronic-payments market has developed into an open conflict  in which both sides have conducted themselves fairly toughly and  the plot of the conflict has taken on the qualities of a  detective story.    The Story of Plastic Money in Russia: Pain Over Rights    ""My wife's credit card was stolen.""    ""Did you put a stop on the account?""    ""No, I'm pleased: the thief is spending much less!""    (A bourgeois joke)    The pioneers in developing the Russian consumer-payments  market were Diners Club International (which, incidentally, in  1950 put out the world's first international credit card) and  American Express. In 1969 they signed an agency agreement with  the State Committee for Foreign Tourism in the person of its  commercial arm, the Inturist All-Union Joint-Stock Company, for  servicing those payment systems' credit cards; that is, the  joint-stock company became those systems servicing agent.    In 1974 an analogous agreement was concluded with VISA  International, in 1975 one was signed with Eurocard/Mastercard,  and in 1986 one was signed with JCB International.    During the entire time that agency rights to the servicing  of  credit cards belonged to the Inturist All-Union Joint-Stock  Company, the entire technical side of the work was handled by a  credit-card group operating under the State Committee for  Foreign Tourism, and commercial settlements were carried out on  behalf of Inturist through the USSR Bank for Foreign Economic  Activity.    At the end of 1987, in accordance with new legislation, the  Inturservis All-Union (naturally!) Economic-Accountability  (absolutely essential!) VTO [Foreign Trade Association]  (subsequently All-Union Joint-Stock Company] was founded, and  Inturist's agency rights with respect to all payment systems  were transferred to it. A special subsidiary company,  Inturkreditkart, was set up for the technical servicing of  payments. Igor Fedorov became head of the main company, and  Aleksandr Kapustin started working in the subsidiary (we will  encounter their names again more than once).    And this is when the first intrigues in the Russian  ""plastic""  market began, intrigues which illuminate by reflected light many  years of competition among international payment systems on the  remaining five-sixths (or approximately that much) of the globe.    In January 1988 VISA International elected the Inturist  All-Union Joint-Stock Company as a member possessing basic  rights (including the right of emission), despite the fact that  the joint-stock company was not a banking institution. When this  was done, Inturservis was recognized as a managing agent of  Inturist.    In response, Eurocard (subsequently Europay) elected the  USSR  Bank for Foreign Economic Activity as its member.    Beginning in November 1988, Inturservis started exercising  Inturist's membership rights, concluding direct contracts with  trade enterprises dealing in foreign exchange (and this was just  the time when they were undergoing a development boom). At the  same time, the servicing of all payments continued to be carried  out exclusively through the Inturservis processing center, which  at that time was the only agency in Russia that had the  requisite software, hardware and personnel to handle the  complete cycle of servicing ""plastic"" payments: the processing  of credit cards, the confirmation of purchases and verification  of account balances, the conversion of the payment into  electronic form and computer connections with the payment  system, the handling of the payment disbursal, and the  offsetting of client's payments between banks.    The present stage in the development of the Russian ""plastic  money"" market began in September 1991, when Kredo Bank, which  was accepted as a VISA International member in 1990, started  offering VISA cards in Russia. Later Most [Bridge] Bank,  Inkombank and Mosbiznesbank started carrying out programs to  issue VISA cards, while the Inturservis processing center  continued to service payments made with their cards.    In 1992, after the sole Russian member of Europay  International, the USSR Bank for Foreign Economic Activity,  ceased its banking activity in November 1991, Europay  International started to accept other Russian banks as members,  among which the most active became Most-bank (to which the  personnel that had been working with credit cards in the USSR  Bank for Foreign Economic Activity transferred) and Dialog Bank.    In the meantime, Kredo Bank, Most Bank and Dialog Bank--the  first three banks to become members of both VISA International  and Europay International--proposed to Inturservis that it  divide its business in servicing VISA and Europay credit cards  into two parts. However, the negotiations proved unsuccessful,  since it is possible to transfer agency rights, but rather  difficult to divide a processing center and its personnel.    Then the banks decided to found another processing center,  Kardtsentr [Card Center], which was to be only for the Europay  system. Naturally, that undertaking received the active support  of Europay international, since Inturservis had historically  received the support of VISA International.    Then Kredo Bank, however, decided (we do not rule out the  possibility that it did so under the influence of the fairly  jealous VISA International) not to take part in Kardtsentr, and,  joining with Inturservis, on 11 November 1992 it founded the  United Card Service Joint-Stock Company (UCS), the Russian  version of whose name was United Credit Card Company--KOKK (for  more detail, see the following section of the article).  Aleksandr Kapustin became the president of UCS, and Yuriy Agapov  became chairman of the board. In January 1993 authority to carry  out Inturservis's activities in the area of ""plastic"" payments  was transferred to UCS (for $900,000).    That is how two processing centers emerged in the market,  while UCS has so far retained an exclusive position with respect  to the processing of VISA, Diners Club and JCB cards. At the  same time, payments with Europay cards can be serviced by both  UCS and Kardtsentr.    To give a more complete picture, it should be added that in  1993 many national card-payment programs started to be  implemented--STB, Olbi, Ortcard, Most-card and Union Card.  However, because these cards are mainly connected with ruble  accounts, and no connection with external payment systems is  required for servicing them, the processing of these cards is  usually carried out by their issuers' own processing centers  (for more detail, see KOMMERSANT No. 33, 23 August 1993).    Once again, to give a more complete picture, let us also  mention the American Express company, which has not taken any  part in the conflicts that we are going to relate: at the  beginning of 1992 American Express began to terminate, de facto,  the fulfillment of its existing agency agreement with  Inturservis, and by the end of the year all of Inturservis's  contracts with enterprises for the servicing of payments made  with the American Express card were transferred to American  Express (Russia) Ltd., which assumed functions related to the  technical servicing of payments.    A Classic Capitalist Conflict: Kredo and Most Divide Their  Property But Do Not Divide Their Market and Management    ""Filled with agitation,    I undid your corset--    You ran away laughing,    While I stood there pondering....""    Count Aleksey Tolstoy    And so, by the fall of 1993 the UCS company was a  joint-stock  company with authorized capital of $1 million, in which 49  percent of the shares belonged to the Inturservis All-Russian  Joint Stock Company--the owner of agency rights for all payment  systems--while 39 percent belonged to Kredo Bank (through which  all payments serviced through UCS passed), and 12 percent  belonged to the joint Finnish-British company Inpass Ltd. In the  latter, 50 percent each of the shares belonged to the Finnish  Okobank, through which VISA payments passed after going through  Kredo, and to the British company CardTec Ltd, which develops  hardware for the credit card business.    In our view, a fateful role in the subsequent development of  events was played by the public disclosure of plans for the  reorganization of UCS, plans which had been jointly developed by  the joint-stock companies. (The presentation of UCS  stockholders' new policy took place on 28 September--see  KOMMERSANT No. 39, 4 October 1993).    According to the strategy that had been developed, the  Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock Company was supposed to  transfer its exclusive contracts with enterprises for VISA and  Europay cards to the Russian banking sector, leaving UCS (or its  successor) only rights and contracts to service Diners Club and  JCB cards.    For this purpose, Russian banks that were VISA members were  supposed to establish, on the basis of equal rights, a new Viza  Rossiya Servis (VRS) company, to which the Inturservis  All-Russian Joint-Stock Company's contracts--but only contracts  pertaining to VISA cards--were supposed to be transferred. (It  must be noted that in most countries national bank associations  that are members of international payments systems have long  since been established.) At the same time, according to the  plan, all technical operations related to the servicing of  credit cards would continue to be carried out by UCS (on the  basis of a service agreement with VRS).    On the other hand, the Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock  Company was supposed to transfer contracts for Europay cards to  Kredo Bank--either permanently or until such time as an  agreement was concluded to establish for Europay cards an  organization analogous to Viza Rossiya Servis (that is, a  national association), to which all rights for the servicing of  cards would be transferred.    In and of itself, this latter circumstance gave Kredo  certain  potential advantages in the ""plastic money"" market, at least  until such time as a Europay national association was  established. However, what was key in the new strategy was not  even that, but the point according to which, until Russian  Europay member-banks had been granted the right to utilize the  technical services of UCS along with the services of Kardtsentr,  VRS members would not be allowed to seek the services of  Kardtsentr for servicing the cards of Europay and other systems  (in the event that Kardtsentr started working with systems other  than Europay).    There are grounds for assuming that this point was included  in the UCS program as a countermove after it became known that  Europay International was pressuring the Russian Europay  member-banks to obtain a provision whereby Kardtsentr for three  years would not provide services to trade enterprises that had  agreements with VISA. We learned of the existence of such  pressure and of attempts on the part of Europay to ""use force to  impose exclusivity"" from [Piter Derbi], the president of Dialog  Bank, which is one of the founders of Kardtsentr (See CARDS  INTERNATIONAL, No. 93, 6 September 1993).    In this connection, it is indisputable that the UCS  technical  exclusivity proposed for the members of Viza Rossiya Servis  would have substantially graver consequences for the affairs of  Kardtsentr than Kardtsentr's technical exclusivity would have  for the future of UCS. Faced with the necessity of choosing,  both processing centers' clients would more likely choose  UCS--by virtue of the greater work experience contributed to UCS  by Inturservis.    Naturally, diametrically opposite opinions exist with  respect  to the quality and efficiency of Kardtsentr's work. They range  from the opinion set forth in an open letter from Kardtsentr's  founders to the officers of UCS (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY for 14  August 1993), to that expressed by Fedor Naumov, the head of  Inkombank's credit card department, who left Kardtsentr: ""They  have existed for 13 months now and have not yet done anything.  Conducting affairs that way is a mockery of banks (see EAST  EUROPEAN BANKER, No. 35, September 1993).    However, even Dmitriy Alekhin, Kardtsentr's managing  director, has said the following: ""We started with nothing, and  in order to provide high-class services and compete with UCS, we  need not only technology but experience ... at present we are  not yet ready"" (see EAST EUROPEAN BANKER, No. 35, September  1993).    In other words, after the presentation of the UCS's  stockholders's agreement, the situation required decisive  actions from the active members of Kardtsentr, if only to  preserve the status quo in the credit-card servicing market,  especially for the servicing of the deeply kindred Europay cards.    Open Letter From Bankers (August 1993) on the Utility of  Honest Competition    To Mr A. V. Kapustin, General Director of KOKK    Mr I. A. Fedorov, Chairman of the Board of the Inturservis  All-Russian Joint-Stock Company    Mr Yu. V. Agapov, President of Kredo Bank    Mr I. V. Lipanov, Vice-President of Kredo Bank    Lately the mass media have carried invalid reports aimed at  discrediting the activities of the Kardtsentr Joint-Stock  Company, whose founders are a group of Russian banks.    We regard these publications as the manifestation of  unscrupulous competition and profoundly regret that such methods  are becoming common in Russian banking practice.    As founders of Kardtsentr who have an interest in the  successful development in our country of a civilized system of  settlements employing plastic cards, we propose to you in the  future to wage competition in the financial services market by  other means, namely: by means of the quality of services  provided to clients, the speed with which settlements are made,  and attractive prices for services provided.    We sincerely desire interaction and cooperation and hope  that  such unseemly occurrences will not happen in the future.    [Signed] President of the National Credit Bank    O. Boyko    President of the Stolichnyy Bank    A. Smolenskiy    President of Most Bank    V. Gusinskiy    President of Elbim Bank    S. Morozov    President of Yugorskiy Bank    O. Kantor    The first round of the counterintrigue developed according  to  a perfectly capitalist scenario: in October-November of last  year, Most Bank entered into negotiations with Inturservis for  the purchase of its block of 49 percent of UCS stock. The ground  for negotiations had been prepared by the expression of a  willingness (within the framework of the UCS stockholders'  strategic agreement) to give up the rights to servicing credit  cards. Inturservis seemingly let it be known that it was  prepared to quit the ""plastic market."" Indeed, in the past few  years the alignment of forces has changed substantially, and the  Inturist system has ceased to be the principal source of  ""plastic"" payments in Russia.    However, Igor Fedorov, president of the Inturservis  All-Russian Joint-Stock Company, naturally wanted to get a good  ""indemnity."" To do so he wanted, first of all, to sell the  entire block of stock as a whole (without breaking it up), and  second, to do so on a competitive basis.    Consequently, Inkombank, which is active in issuing VISA  cards, entered into a fight with Mosbank for the Inturservis  bloc of UCS stock. Because of purely technical circumstances,  Inkombank dropped out of the competition, but in the course of  bidding it raised the acquisition price to $2.3 million, that is  to nearly 4.7 times the nominal value.    Toward the beginning of December Igor Fedorov concluded a  contract with Most Bank, received money for the bloc of UCS  stock, and seemingly offhandedly informed the UCS board about it  (directly int he course of a board meeting).    The Gogolian tableau vivant was unexpectedly interrupted by  Mr [Pekka Khonkanen], president of Inpass Ltd. With purely  Scandinavian imperturbability he announced that Most Bank had  also offered to buy his 12 percent of UCS shares--for good money.    The reaction of Kredo Bank's representatives on the UCS  board  was instantaneous--they immediately (at the board meeting) made  Mr [Khonkanen] an offer that he couldn't refuse. Realizing that  haggling was inappropriate in this case, he took about $560,000  for his 12 percent, that is, the same 4.7 times the nominal  value.    Consequently, as of 3 December UCS became the joint property  of Kredo Bank, whose 51 percent had cost it less than $1  million, and Most Bank, which had paid $2.3 million for 49  percent of the stock. And Igor Fedorov and [Pekka Khonkanen]  evidently remained extremely pleased with themselves--the  securities in which they had invested had brought their  companies each 370 percent annual earnings in foreign exchange,  which is close to the result recorded in the Guinnes Book  of World Records, and that is without counting  dividends--based on the results of 1993, UCS's net profit for  distribution came to $600,000, or 60 percent per share. And it  cannot be said that Inturservis and Inpass Ltd. sold everything  that they could--the former firm left itself all agency rights  with regard to the technical servicing of credit cards (UCS  continued to lease certain rights from Inturservis), and the  latter left itself the status of the first nonresident bank  hooked up to the chain of VISA credit card payments serviced by  UCS.    And this is when the second round began, which now took  place  in the spirit of a ""Red Guard attack."" The officers of Most  Bank, deciding to exercise their rights as a stockholder,  submitted a proposal to the management of UCS to put all  payments for the Europay system in the Russian stage of the  banking chain through Most Bank, rather than Kredo Bank.    Here, in our view, commentary is needed. The bank through  which the processing center carries out the ""plastic"" payments  for at least one of the credit card systems receives  considerable advantages. They are the following:    First of all, UCS is an extremely large client. In 1993 UCS  turnover for servicing credit-card payments came to nearly $170  million, approximately one-fifth of which was for the Europay  system. Naturally, balances of funds in the UCS account would  become a good backup in the short-term money market for any  bank. Moreover, since cash foreign exchange is now out of favor,  one can predict a substantial increase in electronic turnover to  show up in the 1994 results.    Second, from every transaction the servicing bank takes a  commission, which in this case could come to several hundred  thousands of dollars a year.    Third, the servicing bank also gains the opportunity to  acquire for itself extremely large settlement accounts of UCS  clients that accept ""plastic"" payments directly. For enterprises  accepting credit cards, it is advantageous to have an account in  the servicing bank because in that case their payments are made  a day or two faster. At least, all clients serviced for the  Europay system at Kardtsentr have accounts in Kardtsentr's  founding banks.    Fourth, the servicing bank can also offer new clients  services related to the collection of cash proceeds, getting  additional commissions and a considerable influx of cash from  that.    Fifth, by acquiring clients, the bank gains the additional  opportunity to place corporate and personal credit cards issued  by the bank among clients and their personnel, and to eventually  provide those firms with its automatic teller machines.    UCS president Aleksandr Kapustin responded to the proposal  by  Most Bank's officers in accordance with his charter: if the  owner of the controlling block (Kredo) gave approval for a  contract to be transferred ""from itself"" to Most Bank, Mr  Kapustin would not object.    Kredo, naturally, graphically demonstrated the elementary  truth of capitalism, namely, the difference between a block of  shares and a controlling block. As a result of which, an  unpleasant truth was revealed to Most Bank: having paid $2.3  million, it had not acquired any rights with respect to the  management of UCS and had not acquired any additional market or  income. The possible dividend on UCS stock is poor consolation,  since on the basis of 1994 results it will (in terms of the real  capital spent by Most Bank) amount to no more than 30 percent in  foreign exchange, and that is in the event that the principal  UCS stockholder does not adopt a plan for large-scale  reinvestments.    Consequently, accomplishment of the main ""political""  objective--to save Kardtsentr and its clientele by influencing  the process of the reorganization of UCS and establishment of  Viza Rossiya Servis--remained just as remote as it had in  September 1993. Under these circumstances, Most Bank decided to  resort to ""the continuation of politics by other means,"" by  carrying out a revolution in UCS's management staff.    Practically a Detective-Story Plot: Most Bank versus Toby  Mitchell    ""Many will revile me    And now will probably ask    Why do I joke so stupidly?    What's it to them? I want to!""    Aleksandr Pushkin    KOMMERSANT Toby Mitchell citizen of Great  Britain, 36 years old. Worked for the VISA International company  starting in 1985; in 1990 was appointed director of the Central  and Eastern Europe Department; in 1992 became vice-president of  VISA International. In January 1993, with the consent of VISA  International, Mr Mitchell founded the Payment Systems  Partnership company, in which he named himself senior partner.  The company's principal job is consultations regarding the  development of consumer payment systems in Eastern Europe.    According to Mr Kapustin, after relations between the  management of UCS and the junior stockholding firm (Most Bank)  grew strained, Most Bank's representatives expressed a desire to  see the firm's accounting reports. The company's officers  accommodated the junior stockholder's desire and gave Most  Bank's specialists access to their financial documents. It must  be noted that the group sent to UCS was not an auditing  commission of the joint-stock company in the full sense of the  word (and could not have been one, according to UCS's charter),  since it represented the interests of only one of the  stockholders. Nonetheless, the UCS officers decided not to hide  ""their cards."" Aleksandr Kapustin regarded the audit with  Olympian calm, since in 1993 UCS's financial documents had  repeatedly been audited by Centrobank, the Anti-Trust Committee,  the tax inspectorate, and several auditing firms (including  Ernst  Young specialists), and even by the Ministry of State  Security.    In the course of their work, the Most group's specialists  called attention to documents confirming a payment for the  amount of $95,000 from the firm's account to the personal  account of Mr Mitchell for the performance of a set of work  under contract with UCS.    Let us note that in conversation with a KOMMERSANT  correspondent, Kredo Bank's vice-president Igor Lipanov, a  member of the UCS board, said that the decision to conclude a  contract with Mr Mitchell was approved by UCS's Council of  Directors and board, and made in accordance with the UCS's  charter, and that the results of its fulfillment were detailed  in an appropriate report dated 29 May 1993 and deemed highly  satisfactory by the board. Subsequently, this fact was certified  in an official letter signed by Yuriy Agapov (Kredo's president  and chairman of the UCS board) and Igor Fedorov (president of  the VISA International and member of the UCS board).    However, as Mr Kapustin reported, immediately after the  group  of Most Bank specialists had called attention to the documents  pertaining to the contract with Mr Mitchell, those documents  were confiscated according to established procedures by a  representative of the okrug tax police, which coincidentally  (let's call it a coincidence) showed up at UCS literally ""on the  heels"" of the group of Most Bank staff members (the UCS  bookkeeping department has an official record of the  confiscation).    KOMMERSANT Subsequently KOMMERSANT's  editorial staff decided to clarify the question of why a payment  by UCS was made to Mr Mitchell's personal account (although that  is not contrary to Russian law), rather than to the account of  Payment Systems Partnership, which would be more typical for  standard Russian practice. We asked that question to Mr Mitchell  himself and also sought the opinion of Mr Antony Berendt, a  specialist in British business and banking law from the London  School of Business. It turned out that the Payment Systems  Partnership firm, in principle, has no account other than Mr  Mitchell's personal account. The point is that British law  allows the formation of a legal entity as the commercial name  (trade name) of an individual, with the use of the individual's  personal accounts for business purposes. In other words, whereas  Russian law contemplates the possibility of engaging in  entrepreneurial activity without the formation of a legal  entity, British law contemplates the possibility of engaging in  entrepreneurial activity with the formation (for purposes of  taxation and the creation of a subject of commercial and  international law) of a legal entity in the form of a trade  name.    Nonetheless, on 9 February (two days after the completion of  the audit and a day after the confiscation of documents  pertaining to the contract with Mr Mitchell, a letter from Mr  Polyakov, a vice president of Most Bank, was received by the  Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's Administration for  Combating Economic Crimes. The letter stated that the transfer  of the money to Mr Mitchell had caused harm to Most Bank's  interests, and it also contained a request to ""resolve the  question"" of bringing criminal charges against Mr Kapustin on  the basis of this fact (the editorial office has the text of the  complaint, as it does the texts of the other documents  mentioned). Naturally, the removal of the ""criminal"" from the  office of UCS president would be decided automatically.  Evidently, in that case even the main stockholder would lose the  possibility of influencing the situation, since the decision to  remove a ""criminal"" from the management of the main processing  center in Russia would most likely be supported by the  management of VISA International and Europay International.    It is interesting that, according to Mr Kapustin himself,  whom staff members of the Economic Crimes Administration invited  for a conversation, confidential documents confiscated on the  day before by the representative of the okrug tax police were  appended to Mr Polyakov's letter (incidentally, a sentence to  the effect that documents pertaining to the transfer of money to  Mr Mitchell are attached to Mr Polyakov's letter exists in the  text of the letter itself). Moreover, according to unofficial  information obtained by UCS's representative in the City  Internal Affairs Administration's Economic Crimes  Administration, Most Bank's complaint had been brought to the  Economic Crimes Administration by Col Papakhin, the deputy  director of the Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's  Investigative Administration, who at that moment was on a  regular leave; while on leave, Mr Papakhin was awaiting an order  dismissing him from the internal affairs agencies, after which  he was supposed to begin work at Most Bank (as KOMMERSANT's  staff has learned, starting this March Aleksandr Papakhin began  performing official duties at Most Bank).    Not finding any indications of a crime in the UCS  president's  actions, on 17 February the Moscow City Internal Affairs  Administration's Administration for Combating Economic Crimes  issued a order declining to initiate a criminal case.    Nonetheless, on 17 February staff members of the Moscow City  Internal Affairs Administration's Investigative Administration  issued an order on the initiation of criminal case No. 003209  with regard to the fact of the transfer of money to Mr Mitchell  ""by an unknown criminal.""    Mr Gusinskiy, Most Bank's president, sent a letter to the  Moscow Procuracy (initial No. 561, dated 23 February 1994)  expressing the opinion that staff members of the City Internal  Affairs Administration's Economic Crimes Administration had a  ""prejudiced attitude"" toward the case. But the Moscow  Procuracy's Administration for Oversight Over the Execution of  the Law in Internal Affairs Agencies issued an order revoking  the order of the City Internal Affairs Administration's  Investigative Administration to initiate a criminal case on the  grounds that the latter order was ""illegal"" and ""issued on a  contrived pretext.""    This last circumstance requires separate commentary. The  point is that the order to initiate a criminal case indicated  that it had been initiated on the basis of an audit conducted by  the Seventh Department (for combating organized crime) of the  Moscow City Internal Affairs Administration's RUOP [Regional  Administration for Fighting Organized Crime]. However, staff  members of the Moscow Procuracy (and this fact is officially  confirmed in the procuracy's order revoking the order initiating  the criminal case) established that, with respect to UCS, an  ""audit by the Seventh Department of the Moscow City Internal  Affairs Administration's RUOP was not conducted,"" and  consequently, no materials from the ""audit"" had been received by  the City Internal Affairs Administration's Investigative  Administration.    In reality, the City Internal Affairs Administration's  Investigative Administration had initiated the criminal case  after receiving a 17 February 1994 letter from Most Bank, which  was registered there under number 387 (the fact of the receipt  of the letter from Most Bank is mentioned by Vladimir Gusinskiy  in his letter to the Moscow Procuracy that is referred to above).    In addition, the Investigative Administration's order  initiating the criminal case states that ""an unknown criminal  unjustifiably transferred $95,000 from an account at Most Bank  to Account No. 070614623 at the Republic National Bank (New  York)."" In reality, UCS had no settlement account in Most Bank.  Moreover, as UCS's financial documents indicate, money was not  transferred to Republic National Bank, either. Mr Mitchell's  money was transferred from the International Moscow Bank (from  the UCS account) to Kredo Bank (to Mr Mitchell's account).  However, since International Moscow and Kredo do not have direct  correspondent relations, the money, in accordance with  established procedure, was transferred through Republic National  Bank, which has correspondent relations with both banks and is  Kredo's principal correspondent bank for settlements in U.S.  dollars.    Nonetheless, after the Moscow Procuracy's decision, the case  was transferred further along official lines to the RF Procuracy  General. At this stage, the company's principal stockholder,  Kredo Bank, was involved in the process of examining the case.  On 17 March the Bank's vice-president Igor Lipanov sent a letter  to the Moscow Procuracy and the director of the Investigative  Administration of the RF Procuracy that noted that, in the  opinion of Kredo Bank's officers, Most Bank ""is attempting to  provoke a criminal investigation of the UCS president on a  contrived pretext for the purposes of gaining competitive  advantages in the market.""    In sum, as KOMMERSANT's editorial staff has learned, on 6  April the UCS officers received an official letter (initial No.  16-574-94) confirming the official agreement of the RF Procuracy  General with the order of the Moscow Procuracy not to initiate  the criminal case against Mr Kapustin.    With this decision by the Procuracy General, the detective  aspect of the plot was exhausted, for Mr Mitchell, in an  interview with a KOMMERSANT correspondent, stated that he would  decline to bring suit against Most Bank and its officers, whose  actions, according to him, had damaged his reputation.    Thus, suspicion was lifted from the UCS management, the  company's activities continued, and Mr Kapustin ceased to be  associated in business circles with Article 93-1 of the RSFSR  Criminal Code (from eight years to the ""top,"" and invariably  with confiscation of property).    It would seem that the time had come to engage in  implementing the UCS strategy in full. But everything worked out  somewhat differently.       VISA and Europe: Their Shadows Swayed on the Threshold    ""They're dissatisfied with my reply,    `Resolve our dispute as fast as possible!'    They repeated with ardor    And with the same rattling of spurs.    ""I cast a glance around the room    And it was as though I were charmed by the design    `I like BOTH very much!'    I told them and ran out.--Count Aleksey Tolstoy    For a final clarification of the situation in the ""plastic""  market and of the prospects for its development, we turned to  the officers of the international ""plastic"" associations  themselves, whose interests the leading Russian banks in the  internecine guarded (along with their own), appealing to them in  the course of the matter for support.    Last week Alan Goslar, first vice-president of VISA  International, told us the following: ""My attitude toward the  existing situation is this: it's a purely Russian problem.  Russia's banking community should sort out this whole thing on  its own. After hearing both sides, I said that they themselves  should find a solution. We cannot act as a jury. They are their  affairs, and I will do everything possible to keep from being  drawn into the conflict.    ""Granted, Russian banks are inclined to create squabbles out  of nothing and to deal with one another harshly,"" continued Mr  Goslar. ""The methods employed in business are very different  from ours. They very much like to push each other toward the  abyss. Taking some one to the point of collapse is practiced  very widely here. It's a market where the competition is very  strong, and the banks have a weapon that we never dreamed of.  According to my observations, Mr Gusinskiy believes that there  are battles ahead that he is capable of winning. I'm sure that  he will take very decisive actions. But I am prepared to argue  that Kredo, too, is prepared for decisive actions. I'm sure that  Mr Gusinskiy is pursuing certain goals, but will he be able to  achieve them using such methods?""    Something was achieved all the same--Western businessmen  recalled the plots of Jack London and Brett Harte, and maybe  even those of Mario Puzo and Ian Fleming. As a result, we  developed the sense that the conflict among Russian banks had  forced international associations to think seriously about  politics in Russia. They, carefully counting all the stars that  had fallen from the eyes of Russian bankers and illuminated  their way to the Russian market, decided to change their policy  of clearly defined preferences for any specific Russian  structures and, it appears, started to actively assist all at  once. If it does not prove possible to unambiguously defeat  their historically ubiquitous competitor, whom they have  encountered in a new market, then it is better not to lose what  they already have.    Evidently, having noticed the certainty that emerged in  Western associations that it was extremely risky in Russia to  bet everything on one horse (be it UCS or Kardtsentr), Most Bank  appears to have decided to play that situation to its own  maximum benefit. According to the latest information, Most Bank  has taken decisive steps toward individual self-definition in  the credit card market. One can say that it has made an  asymmetrical response.    As Mr Geoffrey de Schrevel, chief manager of Europay  International for Central and Eastern Europe, informed us, Most  Bank's representatives informed him that, while not planning to  quit Kardtsentr, they nonetheless want to build their own  Europay processing center parallel to Kardtsentr's machine.  Since any Europay member-bank may in principle do such a thing,  the association will not object.    In addition, according to Mr Jan Doskar, VISA  International's  manager for Eastern Europe, Most Bank, which is a member of the  VISA system, intends by the end of the year (following UCS) to  install a terminal for satellite communications with their  system.    Despite the fact that Most Bank is losing out to its  competitors in the ""plastic"" market in time, it has a chance for  success.    After all, in the course of the conflict Most Bank evidently  succeeded in burying the idea of UCS stockholders for  establishing a Viza Rossiya Servis and an analogous entity for  Europay with a common processing center in the form of UCS or  its successor. Now, it appears, Kredo Bank has been doomed  forever to ""climb down"" from its controlling block in any  organizations dealing with credit cards. On the other hand, even  if Kredo Bank should try to establish a national association on  the basis of UCS (for example, through the additional issuance  of UCS stock), other banks will hardly join it--if 49 percent is  not enough to redistribute the market, smaller shares are even  more pointless. Thus, Kardtsentr's existing clientele, on which  Most Bank might count in its independent actions in the market,  will be retained in the Europay system (and, in the future, in  the VISA system too).    However, Kredo has not abandoned realization of part of its  original strategic design, either. As KOMMERSANT editors have  learned, back on 15 March Igor Fedorov, on behalf of the  Inturservis All-Russian Joint-Stock Company, officially gave up  to Kredo agency rights and contracts (gave up exclusive  authorization) not only for the VISA and Europay systems, but  for the Diners Club and JCB systems, too. Last week Kredo began  transferring contracts with enterprises (former clients first of  Inturservis and then of UCS) directly to itself and strengthened  its position as the bank that exclusively services the UCS  turnover.    Moreover, according to information possessed by the editors,  last week the Union Card company (founded by a consortium of  Russian banks, including Inkombank, Avtobank, TOKO Bank,  Mosbiznesbank, Delovaya Rossiya [Business Russia], the VBB and  others) concluded a processing contract with UCS (Union Card  payments were previously serviced by Avtobank's center).  Consequently, the network of enterprises accepting Union Card  cards has expanded by at least 2,000 outlets (the number of  UCS's clients for the servicing of payments with the cards of  other payment systems), and the turnover serviced by UCS will  increase by another 10-15 percent, according to our estimates.    In addition, we do not rule out the possibility that the  positions of Kredo Bank, Inkombank and certain bank founders of  Kardtsentr (Dialog, Moscow Savings Bank and others) on the  market may draw closer after the Most Bank's processing center  becomes a competitor not only of UCS but of Kardtsentr itself.    Thus, as a result of the clash that occurred in the credit  card market, the situation of oligopoly (in which experts,  recalling the words of Kardtsentr's director, might assess the  positions of Kredo Bank and UCS as preferable for the time  being) has been preserved.    This situation's plus for clients consists in the fact that,  when UCS and Kardtsentr and Most Bank's new processing center  all start to simultaneously service both the VISA system and the  Europay system, they will inevitably begin to compete among  themselves in terms of rates and services. Moreover, the party  that is losing in terms of service capabilities will most likely  resort to offering dumping rates. Specialists judge the lowest  limit of rates to be 1.9-2.0 percent, as opposed to the current  3.5-4.0 percent. Under these conditions, the servicing of  payments will for all practical purposes become an unprofitable  business, and the development of it will become exclusively a  money-losing proposition, for 2 percent is the amount of the  external commission that foreign banks take.    In addition, each of the sides will place its reliance even  more emphatically on strong points in its business technology:  Kardtsentr and the banks belonging to it will evidently place it  on the development of automatic teller machines, and UCS--on the  installation of universal devices for processing the cards (at  the so-called POS--point of sale) of all the systems represented  in the market, including national ones (STB, Union Card, etc.).    On the other hand, the minus for clients will be that it  will  hardly be likely that Russian banks, having numerous processing  centers, will ever reach any agreement on organizing the  national mutual offsetting of credit card payments made within  Russia (and that idea was seemingly the second level of the  strategy of Kredo Bank and UCS), as happens in other countries,  including those with a substantially smaller ""plastic"" turnover.  Accordingly, the money in settlements will continue to race  overseas--with an inevitable loss of pace and of external  commission (2 percent of the amount).    By withdrawing, for all practical purposes, from creating  the  possibility for the Russian banking sector to organize the  internal mutual offsetting of payments on the basis of a single  processing center, international associations have not helped  the Russian ""plastic"" market to rise to a new stage. It cannot  be said that they have come off as losers: they have been left  with respectable insurance deposits (according to the  associations' rules, the Russian servicing banks and processing  centers keep them in foreign banks), almost $4 million in  external commissions (based on the forecast for 1994), and also  the possibility of ""sitting"" for two or three days on Russian  money involved in settlements.

The results were at the top end of Wall Street forecasts and cheered investors, who bid the group's stock up Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Later in the session, however, the share price slid back to Dollars 49 3/8 for a net loss of Dollars  1/2 on the day. Chrysler's strong second quarter took the group's first half profits to Dollars 1.89bn, up from Dollars 1.22bn a year ago. It said it earned Dollars 956m, or Dollars 2.61 a share, in the second quarter, up from Dollars 685m, or Dollars 1.55 a share, a year ago. The results beat the previous record of Dollars 938m, or Dollars 2.55 a share, achieved in the first three months of this year. Sales and revenues jumped 19 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 26.3bn, due primarily to strong US demand. Sales between April and June totalled 709,158, up from 625,295 in the previous three months. Chrysler is the first of Detroit's 'Big Three' automobile manufacturers to report its second-quarter results. Industry analysts expect Ford and General Motors to post similarly strong earnings. They point to rising sales in the healthy North American market and the recovery in Europe. Carmakers are also benefiting from cost-cutting measures. The impact of Chrysler's cost-reduction efforts is evident in the improvement over the past year in the group's measure of profit-per-vehicle, which jumped from Dollars 810 in the second three months of 1993 to Dollars 1,300 in the latest quarter. The domestic market has been so strong that Chrysler has struggled to meet demand for its most popular vehicles. Ford and GM have also struggled to supply dealers. Mr Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman, said yesterday the group was 'carefully adding increased capacity' over the next three years. The group's share of the North American car and truck market was 15.4 per cent, unchanged from a year ago. Chrysler Financial, the group's financial services arm, reported second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 44m, unchanged from a year ago. The group also announced yesterday it had contributed another Dollars 600m to its pension fund, and was on target to wipe out its unfunded pension liability - for long a restraint on its stock and credit rating - by the end of this year.

He insisted the prediction, based on a significant recovery of exports, steady growth of 6 to 8 per cent in east Germany, low interest rates and moderate wage settlements, was 'not optimistic, but serious and realistic'. Speaking in advance of next week's publication of the German government's annual economic report, Mr Rexrodt also spelt out plans for measures to deregulate the labour market, promote investment by small and medium-sized enterprises, and accelerate privatisation. The economics ministry forecast is significantly higher than that of the government's independent economic advisers - the so-called five wise men - who predict zero growth. The federation of German banks said yesterday that recovery would only be very gradual because of the low levels of capacity utilisation, low level of industrial orders, and modest outlook for consumer spending. Mr Rexrodt said the government forecast assumed a recovery of between 0.5 and 1.0 per cent in west Germany, and between 6 and 8 per cent in the east. He agreed that caution was still justified, because disposable incomes would be squeezed by higher pension and social security deductions, and by an increase in oil taxes. Among measures to promote competition and deregulate the German economy, he promised an amendment to energy legislation giving third parties increased access to the country's gas and electricity grids. The government forecast still expects an increase of 450,000 in unemployment, to reach more than 3.9m during the year. Mr Rexrodt said radical thinking was needed to make labour markets more flexible. He called for more low-wage employment, and a relaxation of tax and social security rules governing employment of cleaners and other household staff. Thyssen Stahl, the steelmaking arm of the Thyssen group, yesterday announced a further 1,250 job cuts this year after the continuing 'catastrophic' pattern of earnings in the industry in the last quarter of 1993. The latest redundancies come on top of 12,000 job losses already announced by Germany's largest steelmaker, and will affect primarily all the company's long product plants. Thyssen said it could not make redundancy payments, and asked the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia to provide funding. Separately, Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, announced short-time working in its plants at Bochum, Kaiserslautern and Eisenach during the first quarter of 1994, saying it did not expect 'any significant recovery' in the car market this year.

0,FT944-8370 ,"FT944-8370 _AN-EKUDAAADFT 941121   FT  21 NOV 94 / VW board wants chairman to take calmer tone in public      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, will be told to tone down his public statements at a meeting with senior members of the automotive group's supervisory board this week. Anxiety about Mr Piech's aggression was initially roused by a recent outburst in an interview in which he accused his middle management of cowardice and conspiring against him. It was exacerbated at the weekend by the publication of extracts from a letter accusing Mr Piech of being a dictator. The letter, unsigned and purportedly from a group of middle managers, was sent to Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the supervisory board, Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of VW's home state, Lower Saxony, and Mr Klaus Zwickel, leader of the IG Metall trade union. All are members of the supervisory board's powerful praesidium, which is due to meet Mr Piech on Thursday, a day before a full supervisory board session. The letter warned Mr Liesen not to be misled by the apparent recovery at VW. 'Make plain to Mr Piech that a global concern cannot be run like a feudal fiefdom manned by serfs,' it said. The signs of tension at VW have also revived debate among non-executive supervisory directors on the possible need for a 'shadow cabinet', or substitute top management, which could step in if Mr Piech did not stay for his full five-year contract. The proposal was first floated last year during the still-unresolved industrial espionage allegations against VW's eccentric purchasing director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. While the supervisory board is eager to avoid open conflicts with management which could put VW's recovery at risk, it is also concerned that Mr Piech's confrontational style is damaging the group's image. Its members are understood to be more than satisfied with the benefits of the shake-out started two years ago when Mr Piech took charge. VW last week announced its losses after nine months had been cut to DM73m (Pounds 29.9m) this year from DM1.53bn last year. Although the origins of the letter, published in today's edition of the news magazine Der Spiegel, are uncertain, the internal resistance to Mr Piech's regime was confirmed in a recent interview in which he said he was 'still working' on middle managers reluctant to toe the line. He alleged that unknown VW employees had tried to bug his private telephone and sabotaged his press office communications. The interview was widely seen as the launch of a wholesale offensive on the next management layer. Skoda plan revised, Page 23   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT933-11586 ,"FT933-11586 _AN-DG2CSAAFFT 930729   FT  29 JUL 93 / VW chief seeks to restore confidence      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      WOLFSBURG   VOLKSWAGEN, bruised by allegations from General Motors of industrial espionage, yesterday sought to restore confidence with claims that it was winning the war in the European car market. At a press conference at his company's headquarters in Wolfsburg, Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, aired suspicions of dirty tricks, and repeated charges that GM had resorted to mud-slinging to further its allegations of industrial espionage by VW employees. But he also produced data which suggested that VW was making a strong recovery after its loss of DM1.25bn (Pounds 480m) in the first quarter. He said orders in June were more than 15 per cent up on the same month last year and that the new Golf model had widened its market lead over the Astra, built by Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary. Mr Piech cited an independent motor industry expert's view that GM was trying to damage VW in a commercially motivated war, started after Mr Piech hired Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's global procurement director, in March. In his first press conference to defend VW, Mr Lopez and four former GM employees who followed Mr Lopez to the German car maker, Mr Piech quoted Mr Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at Cardiff University: 'This is a war.' He used Mr Jones's opinions to support VW's claims that the industrial espionage allegations were untrue but were being used to further GM's real aim - to disrupt the German group's recovery programme by depriving it of the renowned cost-cutting and innovative production skills of Mr Lopez and key members of his GM team. But he returned to the attack with accusations that the US group was attempting 'to abuse public prosecutors (investigating GM's spying charges), the media and public opinion to slander our company'. A recent press release from the prosecutors, which linked Mr Lopez with confidential GM group data found in four boxes in a Wiesbaden house formerly occupied by two of his so-called 'warriors', was 'tainted with one-sidedness', Mr Piech charged. It had led to unlawful public prejudgment of Volkswagen. The boxes had been 'in other hands' in the time between Mr Lopez's colleagues leaving the house and the delivery of the material by 'unknown' and 'indirect' ways to the police, he claimed. The prosecutors office said yesterday: 'We are absolutely sure of our facts.' In Frankfurt the VW share price closed up DM11.70 at DM359.70, while other German car makers fell sharply and the blue-chip Dax index dropped more than 11 points to 1,833.91.

0,FT934-6178 ,"FT934-6178 _AN-DKZCOAAUFT 931126   FT  26 NOV 93 / VW in deal to reduce work time      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   Volkswagen and the IG Metall engineering union yesterday agreed a framework deal temporarily cutting working times in VW's six German works by 20 per cent, but gave strikingly different views on how it would affect wages and costs. Mr Jurgen Peters, chief union negotiator, said the annual incomes of around 100,000 workers would be reduced by 10 per cent, while Mr Jochen Schumm, representing VW, said the pact would cut total personnel costs by almost 20 per cent or DM1.8bn (Pounds 713m) a year. The draft pact, which still needs much detailed work before final approval, according to VW officials, will be presented to a meeting of the group's supervisory board in Wolfsburg this morning. Agreement was reached under the shadow of threats from VW that 30,000 of the company's 100,000-plus German jobs would have to go unless cost-savings could be reached through other means. The settlement on a basic 28.8 hour working week would apply 'in principle' to all 105,000 employees, a spokesman said last night. While trade union officials saw the deal as opening the way for widespread reductions in working hours - the union movement's favoured way of spreading work and preventing lay-offs - economists and industrialists were sceptical. Mr Thorsten Neufeld of the Deutsche Bank said the package would not lead to reductions in unit labour costs necessary to restore VW's competitiveness. Adam Opel, VW's main rival, said it was not an appropriate starting point for restructuring the car industry. Mr Ludwig Horatz, head of Hamburg components supplier Phoenix, said the deal had been made possible by VW's generous pay scales which, he claimed, were at least 20 per cent above the metal industry average. Audi, part of the VW group, where pay rates are already 10 per cent below those at the parent, said it was examining the idea. Volkswagen's project is widely seen as an emergency stop-gap measure to allow the deeply troubled company to avoid conflict with its labour force and its principle shareholder, the Social Democrat/Green party government of Lower Saxony. Already committed to bailing out its Spanish subsidiary Seat with a DM1.5bn emergency cash injection, VW would be hard-pressed to find the funds to finance 30,000 redundancies, according to critics of the scheme. Details so far available include withdrawal of a 3.5 per cent general pay increase, which took effect on November 1. Christmas bonuses, holiday payments and other perks are to be reduced and the balance will be distributed monthly instead of in one-off sums.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

The agreement, due to be signed by the management and workforce at Opel's Russelsheim headquarters tomorrow morning, follows Volkswagen's radical proposal for a four-day week starting at the beginning of next year. Opel's agreement, which will apply to its 50,000-strong workforce in western Germany, is a response to the same cost and competition pressures faced by its rival Volkswagen but adopts a different approach, preferring to modify the terms of existing contracts with employees and reducing perks without shortening the working week. As such, it may evolve into a pattern for future settlements in German industry as employers seek to find ways of reducing costs without embarking on further rounds of redundancies. 'The purpose of the agreement will be to force through a linkage between productivity and an improvement in cost structures with the payment of benefits to employees,' a spokesman for Opel said yesterday. Opel was reluctant to disclose details of the agreement ahead of the press conference or to quantify the benefits of the proposed savings. But a report in a regional German newspaper suggested yesterday that the agreement contains three central measures. These are: A differentiation of pay increase between basic pay and fringe benefits. The latter accounts for a substantial proportion of German companies' wage costs and usually increases at the same rate as for the basic income. In future Opel fringe benefits will still increase, but at a lesser rate than the basic wage. The special Christmas bonus enjoyed by Opel workers will be paid in two stages instead of in one tranche. The second tranche will be made conditional on cost improvements and on a reduction in absenteeism and sickness rates at the company's factories in Russelsheim, Bochum and Kaiserslautern. Benefits paid to employees who are on short-time working - that is not working a full week - will be restructured. In return, Opel is understood to have guaranteed to increase production in German factories and reconsider plans to lay off manufacturing employees. This could protect 3,700 jobs in the components sector which had been threatened by possible Opel plans to buy equipment from external suppliers. The agreement has been reached after tough negotiations between employees and employers. Mr Rudolf Muller, chairman of Adam Opel's Works' Council, yesterday said the package would cover a four-year period from the start of 1994 and should ensure the viability of the factories in Russelsheim, Bochum and Kaiserslautern.

0,FT932-10137 ,"FT932-10137 _AN-DEKCSABHFT 930511   FT  11 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC challenge over US fuel economy tax      By NANCY DUNNE      WASHINGTON   THE EC is expected this week to call for a dispute settlement panel under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to take up a complaint over US environmental laws which tax cars heavy on fuel. According to Friends of the Earth, an international environmental organisation, the EC will initiate complaints against US corporate average fuel economy (Cafe) standards and the so-called 'gas-guzzler' tax. The Europeans are concerned that environmental requirements will affect the export of certain classes of EC cars to the US. In the US the fuel economy levels for corporate cars set an average fleet standard of 27.5 miles per gallon, and vehicles with a worse mileage are taxed. The 'gas-guzzler' tax penalises other passenger cars that achieve less than 22.5mpg. Should the US lose the case, it would be bound to raise as much of an outcry as the so-called 'tuna-dolphin' decision, arising from the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Under the act the US banned Mexican tuna caught with drift nets, which also trap dolphins. The EC is challenging the marine act as the US has imposed a secondary embargo on EC countries which may be trans-shipping 'dolphin-unsafe tuna'. Trade analysts worry that anti-environmental messages sent by Gatt could make it more difficult to get congressional approval of a completed Uruguay Round agreement. EC objections to the fuel economy law, the 'gas-guzzler' tax and a luxury car excise tax are listed in an EC report on US trade and investment barriers. 'Although the Cafe tax applies theoretically to virtually all car makers doing business in the US, in reality the only makers who have paid the penalty are the limited-line premium car makers,' the report says. 'The Cafe regulations are biased toward the full-line manufacturers (in other words, domestic manufacturers) that make both small, fuel-efficient and larger vehicles and limited-line manufacturers that produce mostly small vehicles (Japanese manufacturers). 'Thus, the only Cafe penalties paid thus far have been paid by European limited-line car makers. Full-line car makers, such as General Motors, have been able to meet the Cafe standards by averaging the fuel economy of small, fuel-efficient cars with large cars.' In a letter to Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, Friends of the Earth challenged the 'secrecy' surrounding the EC action as 'unnecessary, undemocratic and unwise'. 'The EC cannot claim to be concerned about the development of the trade and environment debate if it persists in attempting to define. . .whether or not the environmental laws of another country are simply disguised trade barriers'.

His emoluments, excluding any pension contributions, increased by 514 per cent from Pounds 316,000 in the previous year, according to the latest annual reports filed by NUKH and NUK for the year ended July 1993. Mr Botnar is also chairman of Automotive Financial Group Holdings, which owns AFG, one of the biggest UK motor dealer groups and a sister company of NUKH. According to annual reports now filed for both holding companies, Mr Botnar increased his total pay from the two groups to Pounds 5.75m in the year to the end of July 1993, a 1,189 per cent increase from Pounds 446,000 in the previous year. NUKH, which had a turnover of Pounds 15.55m in the year to the end of July 1993, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11.34m and paid its directors Pounds 5.6m in total emoluments. The company, whose ultimate parent undertaking, according to the annual report, is the Panama-incorporated European Motor Vehicles Corporation, now has only two directors, Mr Botnar and Mr Manfred Weder, a Swiss national and company director, according to NUKH filings at Companies House. Payments were made to a total of seven directors during the financial year, but five of the seven are no longer directors. The annual report says that Pounds 1.028m was paid in 'compensation for loss of office to former directors' as part of the Pounds 5.6m in total emoluments. The second highest-paid director after Mr Botnar received between Pounds 1.86m and Pounds 1.865m. The report says that Mr Michael Hunt resigned as a director on June 28 1993. Mr Hunt was sentenced last year to eight years in prison for his part in Britain's largest-ever tax fraud, in which he was convicted for conspiring to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax. Mr Hunt's appeal against conviction and sentence were rejected on all counts by the Appeal Court in May. In July he was given leave to appeal to the House of Lords, when the Court of Appeal certified that the case raised a point of law of general public importance.

0,FT943-7425 ,"FT943-7425 _AN-EHWDLAEFFT 940823   FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: VW aims to double Polo sales with updated range      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent      PARIS   Volkswagen, the leading European carmaker, is aiming to almost double sales of its VW Polo small car in western Europe with the launch of an updated range developed with an investment of DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.5bn). Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW management board, said the group was aiming to increase sales to 350,000 in 1995 from 189,000 last year. The launch of the new generation Polo is a vital step for the VW group, which is seeking to recover from record losses suffered last year and to arrest the erosion of its market share in west Europe. Mr Piech said that the improvement in western European new car demand in the first six months had faltered in July, when VW new orders had fallen back to the same level as last year. VW had a strong order book from the second quarter, which would cushion its production in the autumn, but he warned that its financial performance could be harmed if the renewed weakness in demand carried on through the second half of the year. Last week he forecast that the VW group would break even for the full year following a DM1.94bn net loss in 1993. The new generation Polo, which was unveiled in Paris yesterday and which will go on sale in most west European countries in the late autumn, will be built at VW's plants at Pamplona in northern Spain and at its main plant at Wolfsburg in northern Germany. VW has fallen far behind its main rivals in the west European small car market with its outdated current Polo, which was first launched in 1981, and is still dangerously dependent on its Golf/Vento small family car range. The Polo languished in sixth place last year in the small car segment of the west European market with sales of only 189,000; behind the Ford Fiesta (444,000), the Renault Clio (425,000), the Fiat Uno (352,000), the Opel Corsa (346,000) and the Peugeot 106 (268,000). The small car sector is gaining in importance and accounts for around 29 per cent of all new car sales in western Europe. VW urgently needs a competitive car in this market, where both General Motors of the US (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) and Fiat of Italy have launched strong rivals in the shape of the Fiat Punto and the new generation Opel/Vauxhall Corsa. Mr Piech conceded that the group had waited too long to replace the current 13-year-old Polo and said that VW was aiming to cut its model life cycles to six years.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

0,FT934-324 ,"FT934-324 _AN-DL2BSACEFT 931229   FT  29 DEC 93 / Consumers and industry set to spur US growth      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   US businesses and consumers are getting ready to spend heavily on big investments, raising hopes of strong growth next year. Government and private sector economists say the recovery looks likely to be sustained well into 1994 as consumers buy cars and houses, while businesses speed up investment in machinery and computer equipment. The Conference Board reported yesterday that its closely watched index of US consumer confidence rose strongly again this month to 80.2, from a revised 71.9 in November, giving a rise of 20 points in two months. Only the Pacific and middle Atlantic regions still show lower levels of confidence than a year ago, and both have shown some recovery in optimism in the past two months. The December survey marked the sixth consecutive month in which consumers' assessment of their situation had improved, although the biggest rise came in future expectations. Reports from credit card companies show that consumers have been taking their new-found confidence shopping, with Mastercard seeing credit card sales up 24 per cent in the pre-Christmas period this year, and Visa experiencing 32 per cent growth. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's sector-by-sector review of US industry predicts a median growth rate of 2.8 per cent in manufacturers' shipments next year, spurred by increased consumer purchases and business investment in capital equipment. The rise is led by the sale of 14.8m cars and light trucks, a solid 6 per cent increase from this year, and by the construction of 1.3m new homes, a 4 per cent gain from 1993. Shipments of household appliances are expected to grow by 3.6 per cent. Mr Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary of commerce, said the anticipated strength of car sales was 'extremely good news not just for the auto industry but for the entire economy'. The fastest growing industrial sectors in the Commerce Department's annual review both benefit from the strong car industry: metal cutting machinery, whose sales are projected to grow by 12.8 per cent, and electronic components, where an 11.1 per cent advance is expected. The weakest sectors are expected to be defence-related industries such as aircraft parts, navigational equipment and shipbuilding. The department predicts a decline in venture capital, and expects savings institutions to lose some of their share of the mortgage market to other lenders. The banking sector is expected to be profitable for the third consecutive year. US raps Japan over chip trade, Page 2 Clinton - Year One, Page 11   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The Automobile Association said the government's motoring tax proposals were 'more highway robbery on Lamont's road to recovery'. 'With one hand the chancellor has taken more from the motorist in excise duty than he needs to replace new car tax; with the other, he has made all motorists subsidise new cars, and done little to benefit the environment or industry.' The AA said Mr Lamont had delivered 'a blow below the bonnet'. The average motorist would pay an extra Pounds 60 a year which would hit the lower and middle income motorist hardest. Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall, said 'the increase in both fuel tax and vehicle excise duty further increases the cost of motoring, but, on balance, affects the cost of usage more than ownership, which is our preferred option.' Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said that the reform of company car taxation was 'extremely welcome'. 'We are delighted that the Treasury's earlier indicated preference for a complicated system of price banding as a way of establishing a charging scale has given way to our representations for a fixed percentage of price.' The Retail Motor Industry Federation said the company car tax reforms were 'sensible' and would 'produce a fairer and more transparent tax system than previously.' The motor industry 'could rise to the challenge of developing more fuel efficient vehicles,' said Sir Hal Miller, to compensate motorists in the short-term for the government's plan to raise fuel duties in future by 3 per cent a year in real terms. There was a limit to what consumers should be asked to pay in the longer-term. The Freight Transport Association claimed that industry's costs had risen by at least Pounds 230m a year with the 10 per cent increase in the duty on diesel. 'In real terms this increase in fuel duty will mean that the cost of operating a 38 tonne truck will go up by about Pounds 1,000 a year,' said the FTA. 'The unremitting increase in industry's costs from raising fuel duty annually will put us at the top of the EC road transport taxation league and must make it more difficult for us to compete against our European counterparts.'

0,FT943-990 ,"FT943-990 _AN-EI0DNABKFT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US car industry in Asian mission      By VICTOR MALLET      BANGKOK   US motor manufacturers and parts suppliers yesterday embarked on a campaign to increase their business in South-East Asia, where the vehicle market is dominated by Japanese corporations. The 11-company US mission to Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia - sponsored by the big three US carmakers Chrysler, Ford and General Motors and supported by the US administration - comes at a time when US automotive companies are attempting to increase their presence in the region after years of neglect. 'We're looking at how we can become members of the supplier community,' said Mr Christopher Bates of the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers' Association, 'in order to position ourselves for the growth that's going to occur over the next decade.' Critics say they are arriving 20 years too late and have allowed Japanese corporations to dictate policy to South-East Asian governments on everything from industry standards to import tariffs. In Thailand, for example, Japanese manufacturers supply more than 90 per cent of the local vehicle market, with European luxury carmakers making up most of the balance. 'We plan for the next quarter. The Japanese plan for the next quarter-century,' admitted one executive for a US car company. But some US businessmen are bullish about their chances in Asia. They point out that South-East Asian markets are only now becoming big enough to enjoy important economies of scale. They also say some Japanese manufacturing operations in Asia and their local parts suppliers are profitable only because of high tariffs which may be reduced as Asian countries liberalise their trade regimes; just as the Japanese successfully seized a big share of the US market after 1970, US executives say, so it should be possible for US manufacturers to break Japanese dominance in Asia today. US car component makers, furthermore, see opportunities for supplying parts to Japanese assemblers in Asia as they do in the US. In the past two years, Chrysler has begun operations in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to assemble the Jeep Cherokee and has tussled with its Japanese rivals to ensure that its products are not discriminated against in national tariff systems. General Motors has re-entered the Indonesian market. Ford, which closed its assembly operation in Thailand in 1976, is conducting a feasibility study on whether to produce pick-ups in Thailand with Mazda. Thailand is the second largest market in the world for pick-ups after the US. This week's trade mission is supported by a US Commerce Department export promotion programme announced by Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, in June.

0,FT934-17192 ,"FT934-17192 _AN-DJCANAAOFT 931002   FT  02 OCT 93 / Germans and Spanish jostle to keep VW jobs      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   SIGNS of tension between the Volkswagen management and its largest shareholder, the Lower Saxony government, emerged yesterday as confusion grew over the future of VW's Spanish subsidiary, Seat. Mr Gerhard Schroder, the Social Democrat prime minister of Lower Saxony, where most VW production is based, made plain that his main preoccupation was the protection of jobs and factories in his constituency. He issued a statement yesterday after Spanish union leaders proclaimed on German television that the threat of closure hanging over Seat's Zona Franca factory in Barcelona, which employs 10,500, had been lifted. Jubilant Spanish broadcasters quoted the officials as saying they were 'enormously satisfied' by talks with senior Volkswagen group executives in Wolfsburg. Volkswagen officials were markedly more circumspect, cautioning that the crisis at Seat, heading for a DM1.25bn (Pounds 500m) loss this year, was to be 'investigated'. A formal statement issued after the talks said only that the Seat management and worker representatives would examine ways of securing the future of Seat, 'especially in the light of the critical situation' at Zona Franca. Efforts would be made to reach a joint solution for the future of the works, it added. Mr Schroder, a member of the VW supervisory board which hires and fires executives, is considered likely to resist any significant back-tracking on rationalisation plans for Spain. If VW, which is heading for a loss this year, cannot make considerable savings elsewhere, then the board may have to step up its hitherto modest programme of job cuts in Germany. Volkswagen employs more than 110,000 in Germany, almost half in its home base in Wolfsburg. 'The security of jobs and production sites in Lower Saxony and the well-being of the whole group are the primary concerns of state government policy,' Mr Schroder said. He added that he did not want to be involved in negotiations on restructuring Seat. Decisions affecting the subsidiary were exclusively a matter for management, he said. And he responded coolly to proposals from Spain that he should meet political leaders from Seat's home region, Catalonia. He did not exclude talks, he said, but any discussion would have to be held in the presence of Volkswagen executives, he said. Yesterday's events were prompted by a mid-week clash after which Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, Seat chairman, resigned when his proposals for restructuring Seat were rejected as 'insufficient' and 'too soft' by the VW group board. Negotiations will continue next week, when Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and his controversial production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, will meet national and regional officials in Spain.

0,FT941-8220 ,"FT941-8220 _AN-EBUCRADPFT 940221   FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Honda may hold the ace when cards are revealed / The future of Rover as talks between BMW and Honda start today      By JOHN GRIFFITHS and KEVIN DONE   In the three weeks since Rover was sold to BMW, the German car maker and Honda Motor, Rover's partner for 15 years, have been eyeing each other closely to see which will blink first. The poker game begins in earnest today in Tokyo as Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, begins talks with Mr Nibuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president. Both parties have powerful cards to play. Honda's wounded pride and loss of face caused by British Aerospace's sale of its 80 per cent stake in Rover might suggest a complete severing of Honda's links with Rover. Honda, in fact, has the power in its Rover agreements to shut down much of Rover. It can give seven days' notice to cancel its key contracts if Rover was sold to another party. That, however, would fly in the face of commercial common sense, at least in the medium term. It has too much to lose from selling parts to Rover and, anyway, the relationship cannot physically be unpicked overnight. But BMW's wish that 'in this new scenario Rover Cars will naturally continue its agreements with Honda in every respect', is just as unlikely to come to pass. BMW wants Rover, for example, to give it a market presence in the lower-medium front-wheel drive sector. Rover plans to launch next year a replacement to its 200/400 series, jointly developing the model with Honda in Project Theta. Yet, the partners are understood to have failed yet to sign a full production agreement, and Honda could baulk. Honda sees the German car maker as one of its most potent rivals in the world car market, and it is impossible to expect that Honda's doors can now remain as open to Rover. Assuming Honda does not plump for the 'doomsday' scenario, there there are three levels of collaboration between Honda and Rover, which the Japanese car maker and BMW must now address: licensing agreements on original Honda products; the selling and buying of components; production and technology transfer from Honda to Rover. These links are cemented by Honda's 20 per cent equity stake in the whole of the Rover vehicle operations (including Land Rover) and Rover's 20 per cent stake in Honda's UK assembly plant at Swindon. Licensing: Most of Rover's cars are based on or dependent on Honda designs and are produced under direct licence from Honda. These agreements can be terminated at three months' notice. Whole vehicles subject to them are the Rover 600 and 400 models. But Rover has greater leeway on the 200 hatchback. Because the 200 was a jointly developed vehicle, Rover enjoys component supply contracts for as long as it builds the current model. This anomaly arose because the Honda Concerto model, on which the Rover 200/400 range is based, appeared in Japan first as a saloon, and the 400 was licensed directly from it, whereas the 200 was developed jointly. Typical of critical component issues is the gearbox used on Rover's own two litre engines. This is a Honda product made under licence by Rover at its Longbridge plant in Birmingham. Withdrawal of its licence could disrupt much of the rest of Rover's car range apart from the ageing Montego, Maestro, Metro and Mini models. The 800 executive car range would be affected even though the car itself has long since diverged from the Honda Legend, on which it was based. However, Honda must supply other key components in it - notably the 2.7 litre Honda V6 engine - for as long as Rover wants to build the car. Buying and selling components: this is a normal arm's length customer-supplier relationship for most components, involving two-way transactions of close to Pounds 400m a year. For example, Honda sells facias to Rover for the Rover 600 and Rover sells Honda the body panels  - produced at Rover's Swindon stamping plant - for the Honda Accord, which Honda produces at its own assembly plant in Swindon. The contracts state supplies must continue for as long as each partner is producing a particular model. However, these contracts are subservient to the licensing agreements. Honda considers that it could legitimately pull the plug on much of Rover's model range, even though Rover could still be legally required to continue providing body panels for the Accord. But pulling the plug would severely disrupt production at Honda's own plant in Swindon. Manufacturing and technology transfer: much of the equipment and tooling used by Rover to build the 600 and 200/400 were developed and supplied by Honda. The equipment was replicated and transferred into Rover's Longbridge plant, thus saving Rover heavy expenditures on developing production facilities for new models. A highly sophisticated multi-welder for body shells, for example, is from Honda Engineering. If Honda terminated the relevant agreements, however, Rover could maintain the equipment adequately for the life of current models. Another key element of the relationship is the maintenance of the component supplier base. Honda manages its supplier base of 160 companies on behalf of itself and Rover, and Rover does the same with its suppliers feeding Rover's plants and Honda's at Swindon. The overall appearance of cars might not change but their parts are updated constantly as part of the Japanese-inspired philosophy of continuous improvement. Lack of access by either partner to the database which keeps track of 20,000 parts could bring chaos to production lines as component mismatches proliferated. One measure of the trust Honda and Rover had developed is that the database for the Accord/Rover 600 is managed and maintained only by Honda at Swindon. Working relationships: Honda believes BMW may not have understood how dependent Rover is on Honda, and how close working relations had become. 'Honda-Rover is not only a business-based corporate relationship', according to one senior Honda executive in Europe. 'So many engineers, so many managers and so many production people have worked closely together for 15 years. This working together is a quite unique experience for the Japanese people as well as the British and I believe that it could create very good mutual understanding between our two cultures. 'For most of the people involved in this collaboration it has been not only their job but their life, including their families.' Some 150 Rover personnel went to Japan to learn production start-up techniques for the Rover 200/400. And some 40 Japanese Honda staff and their families went to Birmingham to stay for nearly three years in getting the project off the ground. When Honda asked Rover to build its Concerto model at Longbridge, Honda opened its factories to Rover staff to allow them to feed back quality information. The information exchange has accelerated ever since. 'So there is not only information exchange in the conference room there was hand-to-hand working together on the shop floor', the Honda executive said. For its part, BMW can offer Honda the lucrative opportunity of continuing to work with Rover and, for example, to supply Land-Rover Discovery four-wheel drive vehicles with Honda badges for the Japanese market. But Honda is sure of its bargaining power. As one senior Honda executive put it informally: 'We hold a card hand of nine aces - but the British public does not know this fact.'

0,FT933-9420 ,"FT933-9420 _AN-DHJCNADGFT 930810   FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Finance chief says VW on road to profit in 1994      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's leading volume carmaker, is on the road to a profit in 1994, Mr Werner Schmidt, finance director, said yesterday. The recovery from losses of DM1.6bn in the first half of the current year was under way and would continue into next year, when group turnover should recover to 1992 levels of around DM85bn (Dollars 50bn). However, Mr Schmidt added, there were still 'imponderables' such as exchange rate variations to be taken into account. On Friday night, an official VW statement said the board was convinced that the turnaround point could be reached this year, provided market conditions did not deteriorate further. Observers said that statement and Mr Schmidt's broadcast comments yesterday suggested that the group was backing away from earlier, confident forecasts that it would break even in 1993. According to provisional statistics, the Volkswagen group's western European market share - including sales of the VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda marques - was 16.1 per cent last month, compared with 17.8 per cent in July 1992. While total industry sales were down an estimated 21 per cent, deliveries of VW brands were an estimated 29 per cent lower. Sales of all General Motors marques, including Opel and Vauxhall, were down 13 per cent and market share was up a provisional 1.2 points at 12.9 per cent last month. As sniping between the two groups continued in the row over suspected industrial espionage, Chancellor Helmut Kohl suggested they should go about their business and stop the 'highly distasteful' public debate. Mr Schmidt said both groups would benefit if the dispute was removed from the headlines, while Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony, which owns almost 20 per cent of VW, appealed again for peace talks between VW and Opel, GM's German subsidiary. 'Opel should not keep raising new obstacles to a sensible and highly-necessary discussion,' his spokesman said. Opel has refused all contacts until Mr Schroder and senior VW executives withdraw allegations of an American plot to damage Volkswagen and of possible perversion of the course of justice. According to news agency reports, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's production director and focus of the spying charges, arranged for the destruction of 'magazines, clippings and correspondence' a week after he was employed by VW. In a statement sent to prosecutors investigating the case, he is reported to have said he did not return any 'possibly' sensitive papers to GM or Opel because destruction appeared to him to be the 'surest and conclusive way to prevent any distribution'.

0,FT944-15870 ,"FT944-15870 _AN-EJQD5AAGFT 941017   FT  17 OCT 94 / Ford to buy 7% stake in Indian carmaker      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   Ford of the US, the world's second-largest vehicle maker, is taking a minority stake in Mahindra  Mahindra, one of the top 10 private sector groups in India. It said it would pay about Dollars 50m (Pounds 31.6m) for a 7 per cent stake in the automotive and tractor manufacturer. The US company's move into India's fast-growing market follows recent, similar initiatives by several leading carmakers, including General Motors, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Daewoo. They are scrambling to establish a presence in emerging markets, especially Asia and Latin America. Ford and Mahindra are to launch a feasibility study into the manufacture of Ford vehicles in India, which should be concluded by mid-1995. It is expected to lead to a joint venture company with equal Ford and Mahindra shareholdings, which will set up a new plant - probably for the assembly of vehicles developed by Ford in Europe. Ford's acquisition of a minority stake must be approved by Mahindra shareholders at a meeting on November 10. Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said the company intended 'to be a significant participant in India's automotive industry in the near future'. Last year, Ford started production of aluminium radiators in a plant near New Delhi in a joint venture with Sumitomo and Maruti. Other moves this year in India include: GM of the US formed a joint venture with Hindustan Motors to invest about Dollars 100m to assemble the Opel Astra, with production planned to begin in the third quarter of 1995. Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany, formed a joint venture with Tata Engineering  Locomotive (Telco) of India, one of the world's leading makers of commercial vehicles, with an investment of about DM250m (Pounds 102.5m) for the assembly in India of Mercedes-Benz E-Class executive cars as well as petrol and diesel engines. Volkswagen of Germany, the leading European carmaker, signed a memorandum of understanding last month with Eicher Goodearth to study feasibility of joint vehicle production in India. The Eicher group produces Mitsubishi light commercial vehicles under licence in India. Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate and the country's third-largest carmaker, has bought a majority stake in DCM-Toyota, an Indian truck maker, which it plans to transform into a carmaker. Volkswagen said Asia offered the strongest prospects for growth in the world car market - annual sales in India are expected to double to up to 500,000 by 2000. India's car market is dominated by Maruti, a joint venture between the government and Suzuki of Japan. Ford and Mazda may link in Europe, Page 7   Companies:-  Ford Motor.

0,FT933-6184 ,"FT933-6184 _AN-DH2AOAEYFT 930828   FT  28 AUG 93 / Switch trend hits insurers: Customers more likely to shop around as premiums increase      By RICHARD LAPPER   CONSUMERS ARE increasingly likely to shop around for cheaper insurance policies in the face of rising premiums, a survey says today. The number of people switching to another insurer almost doubled between September 1991 and March this year, from 1m to nearly 2m, NOP Corporate  Financial, the market research company, says in the survey. NOP, whose survey is based on interviews with 30,000 people, says sharp increases in premium rates had been the biggest factor. Rises in premiums for motor and household policies averaged 20 per cent a year in 1991 and 1992, but many policyholders have faced much greater increases as companies have changed the way they rate risks. Some householders living in areas judged to be prone to subsidence or storm damage have faced increases of more than 100 per cent. Drivers of faster or fashionable cars, which are more likely to be stolen, as well as younger drivers who tend to have more accidents, have been hit by steep increases. Different insurance companies often rate the same risk in a different way, with correspondingly wide variations in quotes. A random sample of six risks by SelectDirect, a telephone-based company jointly owned by Rollins Hudig Hall, the insurance broker, and General Accident, the composite insurer, showed variations of more than 100 per cent. Mr Peter Friend, managing director of SelectDirect, said that the differences reflected the limitations of the data available to insurers. Decisions are often taken on the basis of claims to the insurance company rather than market-wide figures. Mr Friend added: 'Every underwriter believes he is right. The fact is that at the end of the day they all make different decisions because they have all got partial information.' Policyholders who switch their household cover tend to be younger and from the ABC1 social classes, with the C1 group being most likely to switch, the survey says. In the motor insurance market switchers tend to be very young and from the C2DE social classes. Londoners are most likely to switch their policy in the household markets, while those in the Midlands and Wales are the most likely to change motor insurer. The survey adds that women are more likely to switch household policies, while men are more likely to switch their motor insurance policy. Most policyholders are still unlikely to change their cover. The survey shows that 60 per cent of household policyholders and 39 per cent of motor policyholders were unlikely to seek alternative cover. Ms Heather McAdam, NOP director, said: 'There is still an awful lot of inertia in the marketplace.' The Consumers' Association, which has accused insurance companies of charging their customers for past mistakes, welcomed the trend. Mr Roger Taylor, a senior researcher, said: 'It's excellent news. We have been saying for some time that some insurance companies are charging outrageous premiums and our advice has always been that people should shop around.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      THE COST OF INSURANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Household risk Building: Sum insured - pounds80,000.

ARNOLD      This year's 14th annual concert series at San Diego State University's Open Air  Theater gets off to an unusually strong start Friday night with the Cult.    Since the release a year ago of the group's ""Sonic Temple"" album, the British  trio has become one of the most popular rock groups in the world. Buoyed by the  Top 40 success of ""Fire Woman,"" the album quickly went platinum, and the Cult's  concert draw increased steadily to the point where sold-out shows -- even in  multithousand-seat arenas -- are now the rule rather than the exception.    This recent success can be attributed to the band's belated decision to blend  its original cerebral image with high-voltage, mainstream rock 'n' roll,  complete with thick chording and hard-biting guitar runs.    The Cult's roots date to 1982, when singer-guitarist Ian Astbury put together a  band, the Southern Death Cult. The group's intellectual post-punk sound --  heavy on atmosphere, texture and internal conflicts -- was acclaimed by  critics, but pretty much ignored by the public, except in their native England,  where they enjoyed sporadic success.    Two years -- and various personnel changes -- later, the Southern Death Cult's  name was shortened to the Cult, and an album, ""Dream Time,"" was released by  Sire Records. Despite the backing of an internationally distributed record  label, the Cult remained, well, a cult band for some time. In the all-important  U.S. market, air play was limited to college radio stations, and in 1986 the  Cult was presented with the American College Radio Single of the Year award for  ""She Sells Sanctuary,"" from their second album, ""Love.""    In 1987, the Cult finally found a way to go commercial without selling out:  Combining passion with aggression, emotion with commotion, the eclectic with  the electric, to come up with music that not only makes the mind tick and the  heart pound, but the feet move and the hips shake.    They defined this mix on their third album, ""Electric,"" which went gold (for  sales of 500,000 or more); they refined it on album four, ""Sonic Temple,"" which  went platinum (for sales in excess of 1 million).    No wonder, then, that the Cult's Friday night show at the 4,835-seat Open Air  Theater is expected to be a sellout.    Last week, Country Dick Montana of the Beat Farmers got out of the hospital  after a seven-day stay for surgery to remove five tumors from his throat.    ""The medical term is a 'radical full-neck dissection,' and that's pretty much  how I feel: like somebody dissected my neck,"" Montana said. ""Most of my neck  and the right side and the back side of my head are completely numb; they must  have severed a lot of nerves.    ""But they spent a couple of extra hours in surgery to save the voice, and that  seems to have worked. My speaking voice is the same, and while I have lost some  range in the singing department -- the willowy eye-watering tenor is chopped in  half, with the high end completely gone -- I hope to regain that as time goes  on.""    Since his release from the hospital, Montana has been recuperating at home,  hoping that his vocal cords will be sufficiently healed in time for the Beat  Farmers' next concert, Sunday night at Park Place in El Cajon.    And while he's still waiting to get his voice back, he's already regained his  sense of humor.    ""It just seems natural for us to be playing April Fool's Day in a bowling alley  in El Cajon,"" Montana said with a laugh.    The Beat Farmers, incidentally, are in the process of severing ties with  MCA/Curb Records, which has released their last three albums, amid allegations  of label indifference. Anticipating a quick settlement, Montana said, the band  is currently entertaining offers from several other record companies, including  Capitol Records.    The Beat Farmers' next album is already in the can. Tentatively titled either  ""Beat Farmacy"" or ""Loud and Plowed,"" the group's first live album was recorded  New Year's Eve at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa and mixed in February at the  Indigo Ranch recording studio in Malibu.    The album will include ""pretty wild versions"" of Beat Farmers favorites like  ""Riverside"" and ""Happy Boy,"" Montana said, as well as covers of the Kinks'  ""20th Century Man"" and Kenny Rogers' ""Lucille.""

0,FT943-7939 ,"FT943-7939 _AN-EHWDLAE5FT 940819   FT  19 AUG 94 / Cost cuts and higher sales drive VW back to profit      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   Volkswagen, Germany's biggest motor vehicle group, returned to profit in the second quarter, attributing the improvement to restructuring and higher sales. It made a DM133m (Dollars 84.7m) net profit in the quarter after a DM342m deficit in the first three months. As a result, the first-half loss was reduced to DM209m compared with DM1.6bn in the first six months of 1993, when the results were held back by huge rationalisation expenses. Forecasting a slow revival in demand and more benefits to come from cost-cutting, VW said yesterday it expected to break even for the full year. In 1993 as a whole, VW lost DM1.9bn. Analysts said the results were better than expected, and showed clear signs that savings on labour and material costs were now coming through. Mr Stephen Reitman at UBS in London said gross margins of 9.8 per cent in the first half were VW's best for three years. While production rose 3.9 per cent to 1.56m vehicles, operating expenses which include materials and labour costs increased only 2.7 per cent, he added. On performance so far, he expected a modest group profit for the full year, noting that official group forecasts had become much more cautious since last year's predicted advances failed to materialise. According to yesterday's report, the number of vehicles shipped to dealers rose 8.5 per cent to 1.6m in the first half, and deliveries to customers increased 7.8 per cent to 1.73m. Customer sales for the group in Germany fell 3.9 per cent, slightly reducing market share to 29 per cent. However, this was offset by a 7.5 per cent rise elsewhere in western Europe. This resulted in a 2 per cent overall increase in the region and a decline in market share from 16.9 to 16.5 per cent. According to latest industry estimates, western European new car registrations rose 6.6 per cent in the first seven months of the year. Group turnover for the first half was up 6.4 per cent at DM40.8bn while sales for Volkswagen AG, the German parent, slipped 4 per cent to DM21bn. German production fell 1 per cent to 698,000 units, but output from foreign factories jumped 8.2 per cent to 862,000. This surge included a 19 per cent rise at Seat, the recently rescued Spanish subsidiary which was blamed for most of last year's huge losses. Customer sales of Seat marque vehicles increased 23 per cent in the review period. Sales in China, the group's key developing market, rose 14 per cent to 73,500, while south America and South Africa together recorded a 32 per cent advance to 272,000.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

P. PUTNAM'S SONS: $24.95; 469 PP.; 0-399-13517-0)      By Doyle McManus, McManus is a correspondent in the Washington bureau of The  Times and co-author (with Jane Mayer) of Landslide: The Unmaking of the  President, 1984-1988 (Houghton Mifflin).      In the mind of America, Manuel Antonio Noriega has become the stuff of myth,  one of a select few foreign demons (Kadafi and Khomeini are others) who menace  the civilized world with boundless evil. Against such demons, any sanction is  justified, including last December's invasion of Panama by the United States  Army and Marines -- an unprecedented use of American military power to  overthrow and capture a single villain.    To be sure, Noriega is a nasty man: a tyrant, a murderer and a drug profiteer  (not to mention, as did one U.S. general in Panama, a devotee of voodoo and a  wearer of red undershorts). But today, with benefit of hindsight, it is  astonishing that President Bush -- or anyone else in the U.S. government --  could have condemned the crimes of Manuel Antonio Noriega with a completely  straight face. For, as these two admirably reported books on Noriega show, the  Panamanian dictator was known to U.S. officials as a bad apple for 30 years --  three decades during which the same officials consistently elected to ignore  the evidence and continue using Noriega as an intelligence source and sometime  drug-enforcement ally.    When then-Vice President Bush protested during his 1988 campaign that he was  unfairly tagged as Noriega's friend -- that seven administrations, beginning  with Eisenhower, had dealt with the man -- it turns out he was right. But Bush  drew the wrong lesson (or, more precisely, no lesson at all) from his own  history. The wonder is not that Noriega hid his evil nature from so many  Presidents and CIA directors, but that so many administrations had at least  fragmentary evidence of his nastiness and chose not to pursue the matter.    The record, set forth more clearly in these detailed accounts than ever before,  is an infuriating cycle of sin and bureaucratic redemption. For 30 years, the  wily Panamanian plotter engaged in nearly every variety of corruption, but  until 1988, he always made himself just useful enough to the United States to  win official absolution.    As early as 1960, according to Frederick Kempe, Noriega's U.S. intelligence  contact learned that his new Panamanian agent had been arrested for raping and  beating a prostitute; Noriega stayed on the payroll.    In 1971, both John Dinges and Kempe note, the Nixon Administration's Bureau of  Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs compiled a strong case against Noriega for  protecting a marijuana pipeline through Panama. But by then, Noriega was  already Panama's chief of military intelligence, and no conclusive action was  taken.    By 1980, the U.S. attorney in Miami was ready to indict Noriega for gunrunning,  but the Carter Administration blocked the case -- in part because Noriega had  been helpful in sheltering the outcast shah of Iran.    In 1984, Noriega directed the Panama Defense Force's flagrant theft of a  presidential election for a candidate owned by the military; a pair of  hard-working U.S. diplomats even documented the fraud. But the Reagan  Administration favored the military's candidate, too, and ignored its own  evidence.    Not until 1987, when the cumulative outrage of Noriega's rule drove many  normally placid Panamanians into the streets -- and, perhaps more important,  when the cocaine epidemic suddenly became a potent political issue in the  United States -- did the Reagan Administration turn against Noriega.    There are two mysterious characters in this story. One is Noriega, the  endlessly crafty abandoned child of Panama City's slums, ugly protege of the  charismatic strongman Omar Torrijos, master dealer in information, political  manipulator extraordinaire -- but, all in all, a trivial figure on the stage of  history.    The other, more important character is ourselves. Noriega may have been a  devil, but the United States government was the Faust that somehow found itself  drawn to bargain with him time and time again. And, in a sense, our deals with  Noriega mirror every ugly little trade-off U.S. foreign policy makes in the  Third World; most of them simply never go quite this horribly wrong.    The story of Noriega is colorful, exotic and, thanks to Panama's luxurious  profusion of lurid rumors, easy to tell. The story of our own vulnerabilities  is more complicated and subtle, harder to get, but surely more important.    Both of these books are built, irresistibly, around the Noriega saga. But  Kempe, a correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, seems to have been the one  more seduced by the devil Noriega; Dinges, a reporter for National Public  Radio, does a better job of focusing on the United States as a confused and  inattentive Faust.    Both have unearthed considerable new information. Kempe provides a wealth of  detail, especially, on the painful (and abortive) U.S.-Noriega negotiations  over the past two years, as well as the unsuccessful anti-Noriega coup of  October, 1989.    Dinges has done some admirable investigative work, often using the Freedom of  Information Act, as when he reveals a secret State Department report that  showed conclusively that Noriega's men stole Panama's presidential election.    And he has a provocative new thesis: that Noriega, far from being a drug  kingpin, actually disengaged from active complicity in cocaine trafficking  beginning in 1984, when he realized that the issue might endanger his  relationship with the United States. (The ""cocaine"" seized from his office  refrigerator by U.S. troops last December, for example, turned out to be frozen  tamales.)    The final irony, in Dinges' view, is that the U.S. decision to oust Noriega was  as incoherent as the earlier decisions to coddle him. The Reagan Administration  allowed two federal prosecutors in Florida to go ahead and indict the general  even though some aides warned the action would be a foreign-policy disaster.  Why? Because, Dinges argues persuasively, in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra  affair -- and with drugs becoming a major issue in the 1988 campaign -- no one  dared to suggest blocking the indictments.    ""The use of massive military force in December, 1989, that brought Noriega's  rule to an end was the final proof of the failure of American foreign policy in  Panama,"" Kempe writes.    But the failure may go one step further. In part because Bush has quite deftly  turned his sad experience in Panama into a 24-hour military triumph, it is not  at all clear that the lessons of the previous 30 years of failure have been  learned.

0,FT933-8481 ,"FT933-8481 _AN-DHPB3AAMFT 930816   FT  16 AUG 93 / VW opts to keep silent in espionage dispute with GM      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN has withdrawn from the war of words over industrial espionage with car market rival Adam Opel, owned by General Motors, amid fresh media charges contradicting VW's claims that no Opel data ever came into its possession. The troubled German group, which last Friday commissioned auditors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand to carry out an independent internal investigation, said it wanted to return to its main job: making and selling cars. 'We have done everything possible. We have carried out our own investigation and now set up an independent examination,' said Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs, VW's executive director of public relations. 'We are no longer prepared to discuss the matter and every new charge in public.' VW's decision to remain silent coincided with detailed claims in Der Spiegel, the weekly magazine, that 11 Volkswagen trainees had worked for several days at the end of March typing Opel data into computers in a VW property once used to house 'guest workers' from Italy. The magazine also printed alleged excerpts from an affidavit by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW production director, and focus of theft, espionage and fraud investigations. 'Neither before my leaving, in connection with my leaving GM, nor afterwards did I give secret GM/Opel information or data to Volkswagen,' the extracts said. 'In particular I neither inserted nor asked for any secret data to be inserted in VW computers . . .' The reported contents of the affidavit suggested a further shift from his earlier position that he and his colleagues - three of whom are also under investigation - took no secrets from GM and Opel, the US group's German subsidiary, when they left in March. All VW's recent public relations efforts have been focused on dispelling the suspicion - potentially more damaging to the group than the loss of its production director or his helpers - that it has been involved in spying. On August 6, the VW supervisory board said an internal investigation had found nothing to warrant charges of industrial espionage. That statement was accompanied by an admission that 'possibly' secret documents had been destroyed in Wolfsburg at Mr Lopez's suggestion along with personal effects from his former Opel office, and a declaration of 'unaltered trust' in him. Mr Wachs could not comment on reports that Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the company's supervisory board, was to work full-time with the executive management to help it through the current crisis. But he confirmed that non-executive supervisors were working closely with management. VW workers put their trust in Lopez, Page 2 Warriors in a war of words, Page 28   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

0,FT933-3555 ,"FT933-3555 _AN-DINC7AG6FT 930913   FT  13 SEP 93 / Mercedes puts France on list for new plant      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   FRANCE was identified by Mercedes-Benz at the weekend as the fourth short-listed production site for the German manufacturer's 200,000 units-a-year small car project. The others are the UK, the Czech Republic and Germany itself. The disclosure is certain to intensify rivalry among the short-listed countries to attract one of the most prestigious greenfield projects in the motor industry's recent history. In the UK 'there will be as many bids as there are local authorities that know about it', said a government official. He also suggested the project 'will need development funding, so will have to go to a selective assistance area'. Senior Department of Trade and Industry officials in London would not comment on what stage the assessment process had reached and what role the DTI might be playing. However, the Northern Development Corporation, whose area includes the Nissan plant at Sunderland, said it had already responded to a DTI request made last week for details of potentially suitable 250-300-acre sites in its area. The west Midlands, Merseyside and north and south Wales are expected to be among the front-runners in the UK for the project. Welsh development agency officials were at the weekend shedding no light on their involvement. However, they are likely to be encouraged in their own bid for the venture by the recent rapid growth of the motor components industry in Wales and the success of German motor components giant Robert Bosch in establishing a Pounds 100m (Dollars 154m) components manufacturing centre in South Wales, and that of Toyota, whose Pounds 140m engine plant at Deeside in north Wales has just begun component exports to Japan as well as supplying engines to Toyota's car plant at Burnaston in Derbyshire. That the Mercedes assessment process is still at a very early stage was indicated by apparent surprise in both Paris and Prague that the project might be up for grabs. 'German companies have a strategic interest in the Czech Republic generally, but I have not heard of any discussions on this specific project,' a senior Czech official said. It would not be the first time Mercedes has examined the Czech Republic as a possible production site. It discussed a possible Dollars 250m joint venture with two Czech truck makers earlier this year, but the talks broke down in March. Spain is likely to be concerned it is not to be included in the short-list. Its low labour costs have attracted significant German and Japanese motor industry investment in recent years. However, it has been jolted by warnings from Nissan that its operations need to make sharp productivity and quality improvements.   Companies:-  Mercedes-Benz.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

0,FT933-12693 ,"FT933-12693 _AN-DGWCHAANFT 930723   FT  23 JUL 93 / Probe of VW officers widens: Discovery of data seen as link with ex-GM executive      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   CRIMINAL investigations into alleged industrial spying by top Volkswagen executives have been intensified after the discovery of copies of confidential General Motors data. Prosecutors in Darmstadt have widened the probe into possible links between Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who defected from GM to become a VW director in March, and the data found in a Wiesbaden house. Mr Lopez, head of group purchasing and production, is at the centre of investigations which now involve two former occupants of the house, Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Mr Ramon Piazza. Both men are ex-GM employees who followed Mr Lopez to VW on March 22, after he abruptly left the US group on March 15. The announcement of the wider investigations came yesterday from Mr Georg Nauth, a senior public prosecutor in Darmstadt. Responding to Mr Nauth, VW issued a statement headlined 'No documents found in Wolfsburg' - the company's headquarters. The response was the second in two days in which the company appeared to distance itself from the employees under investigation. It said the documents had not been found 'at the disposal' of Volkswagen. Four boxes found in the Wiesbaden house contained documents, overhead projection slides and transparencies from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, and the US parent, according to the prosecutor's statement. Some of the data allegedly related to Opel's secret small car project, code-named the O-Car. Other information concerned sales strategies, cost-cutting plans and the Vectra model. Some of the slides and transparencies had been translated into German at the express wish of 'the accused' - Mr Lopez - the statement added. The prosecutor claimed that, while still head of global purchasing at GM, having already discussed moving to VW with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the German group's chairman, Mr Lopez asked for translations from English of around 150 slides containing details of purchasing and manufacturing plans. Their discovery in the former home of the two former Opel managers, both of whom now work for VW and have denied having documents, is the link with Mr Lopez which the Darmstadt prosecutors said they were seeking. In its response to the prosecutor's statement VW complained that the lawyer defending 'the affected employee', who 'had again confirmed that no secret Opel or GM documents had been found in his possession', had not been allowed to see the papers. The prosecutor's statement gave VW no reason to reproach Mr Lopez, it said. Earlier this week VW claimed that a civil court ruling in a separate but associated case concerned individuals while they were still employed by GM, and was 'not Volkswagen's concern'.

Officer Ronald L. Wyatt, 45, was sentenced to one year's probation and fined  $210 by Municipal Court Judge Herbert Curtis III, who on May 23 found Wyatt  guilty of a misdemeanor involving personal use of a license stick-on tag that  had been assigned to another vehicle, court records show.    A 1990 license for the 25-year-old Cadillac, which Wyatt told investigators he  was buying from a friend, would have cost about $30, a spokeswoman for the  state Department of Motor Vehicles said.    Wyatt, of Moorpark, could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Charles  Goldwasser, declined comment.    Lt. Pat Rooney, spokesman for the Ventura Police Department, would not discuss  the case except to confirm that Wyatt had resigned recently after about 20  years on the force.    Wyatt, a former narcotics officer, was assigned to general investigations at  the time of his resignation, according to the department.    Wyatt has also taught criminal justice courses at Ventura College for several  years, including two classes -- Introduction to Criminal Justice and  Fundamentals of Law Enforcement -- this past spring, the college confirmed.    The Police Department became aware of the illegal tag on Wyatt's car on April  16, nearly one month after he left the vehicle in the department's parking lot,  according to police investigative reports on file with the Municipal Court.  Another officer assumed that the car had been abandoned and began an  investigation.    Wyatt promptly moved the vehicle from the parking lot. When it was seized as  evidence the next day, the sticker had been removed, the reports said.    In an interview with police Sgt. Bob Anderson, Wyatt twice denied that he had  placed the illegal tag on his car, Anderson reported.    But Wyatt acknowledged that he was familiar with the abandoned vehicle from  which the tag had been taken, saying the vehicle was kept at a Santa Paula  storage yard operated by a friend from whom Wyatt had arranged to buy the  Cadillac, the report said. Wyatt also acknowledged knowing the combination to  the lock at the storage yard.    Wyatt reportedly said he believed that the 1990 sticker on his Cadillac was one  of several he had checked out from the Police Department. It is common  department practice for officers on undercover and other special details to  check out tags from seized vehicles to cover the law-enforcement plates and  tags on their automobiles, the report said.    The department forwarded the results of its criminal investigation to the  district attorney in late April, and Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim Gibbons filed the  misdemeanor count May 15, records show. Eight days later Wyatt entered his  no-contest plea.

According to independent estimates, the company is heading for a loss of around DM2bn (Pounds 700m) this year and faces renewed challenges in 1994, when its key domestic market is expected to shrink by at least 5 per cent. Tomorrow's discussions will revolve around a draft agreement with unions, expected last night, to reduce labour costs by temporarily introducing a four-day week in VW's six German factories. But the group chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, is also expected to seek approval for cuts of around a third in his medium-term investment programme. He will also be closely questioned on the group's relatively poor showing in Europe this year and his plans for rebuilding its loss-making US and Japanese operations. The circumstances surrounding the Seat subsidiary's unexpected crash into losses of at least DM1.25bn this year will feature prominently in a report prepared by independent auditors, KPMG Deutsche Treuhand, on the orders of Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the watchdog supervisory board. The document, sent to board members yesterday, is believed to blame poor financial controls and reporting systems. Seat's losses, first discovered in late summer, followed the collapse of a new business plan, drawn up on Mr Piech's orders earlier in the year, and designed to generate a break-even result. Analysts suggest the group's 1993 results will be pushed further into the red by the costs of closing Seat's Zona Franca plant in Barcelona and redundancy payments. The KPMG report also confirms that investigators have been unable to find any evidence that industrial secrets allegedly stolen from General Motors by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM director and now Mr Piech's top production executive, have been used by VW. Criminal investigations are still under way against Mr Lopez in Germany and the US, following his abrupt departure from GM in March, and Hamburg prosecutors are also examining a possible perjury charge against him. The group's difficulties have worsened dramatically in the course of this year, dashing Mr Piech's early hopes of a break-even in his first year of office. Although the company says it expects to sell 1.4m VW marque vehicles in 1994, unchanged from this year, business plan forecasts drafted at Adam Opel, the local GM subsidiary, say total new registrations in the German car market - VW and Opel's main outlet - will reach only 3.02m compared with 3.2m this year and 3.93m in 1992. The industry total will slide below 3m in 1995, according to the Opel projections.   Companies:-  Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo.     Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

The request will be made when trade negotiators meet for consultations in Brussels today. During the two-day talks, Japanese trade negotiators are expected to request that an agreement to maintain exports of Japanese vehicles to the EU at 984,000 units be revised upwards to reflect market changes. 'The market is expected to grow more than we anticipated in March. The basic policy is to increase exports if the market grows,' an official at the Ministry of Trade and Industry said. Under an agreement reached in 1991, Japan is committed to keeping its vehicle exports to the EU within an agreed level each year until the end of 1999, when the EU automobile market is to be fully liberalised. The level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU is determined through consultation and depends on an agreed forecast for regional demand. The two sides have also agreed that if demand varies significantly from initial forecasts, the agreed level of exports could be revised. The Japanese authorities agreed in March to keep Japanese exports to the EU this year at 984,000 units on the basis of a forecast for overall market growth of 2 per cent. That would have represented a nearly 18 per cent decline from the level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU in 1993. However, Miti now expects the EU vehicle market to grow 5-6 per cent this year and wants the level of Japanese exports increased accordingly. Vehicle registrations in the EU between January and July have already risen 5.8 per cent to 7.5m units. Increasing the level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU is likely to unsettle European vehicle producers. The Japanese share of the European market is expected to top 15 per cent by 1998 from nearly 12 per cent in 1992, according to DRI, the UK-based analysts. But it is unlikely that Japanese vehicle exports to the EU will actually increase significantly even if the quota is raised, as the strength of the yen has eroded the price advantage of Japanese cars exported to the EU. Japanese vehicle manufacturers have boosted manufacturing capacity in Europe in recent years, with Japanese plants already accounting for more than a fifth of British car production. The overall result has been that in the first eight months of this year, Japanese vehicle exports to the EU fell nearly 30 per cent to 561,156 units.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

The Ford parent company has been forced to pump in Pounds 330m in new equity to shore up the balance sheet of the UK subsidiary in the face of continuing heavy losses. The UK operation was hit last year by a further decline in car sales, forced production cuts, and heavy marketing and restructuring costs as well as exchange rate losses of about Pounds 100m. The company remained in loss in the first quarter of this year and it warned yesterday that it was uncertain whether it would return to profit in 1993. Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman since January 1 last year, has been forced to take a sharp cut in pay compared with his predecessor. He earned Pounds 94,129 last year according to the Ford of Britain annual report published yesterday. Mr Derek Barron, his predecessor earned Pounds 158,454 in 1991 and Pounds 214,086 in 1990. Ford of Britain's board has been streamlined and cut from 10 to six members. The outlook for a return to profit in 1993 has deteriorated in the face of the steep decline in new vehicle demand in continental Europe in the first four months this year, Mr Bill Brooks, finance director said yesterday. About 41 per cent of vehicles from Ford's UK assembly plants were exported last year. Ford of Britain still expected to achieve a substantial financial improvement this year after two years of heavy losses, Mr Brooks said. The parent company's injection of Pounds 330m in new equity into Ford of Britain last year follows its provision of Pounds 390m of new capital in 1991 - Pounds 100m in new equity and Pounds 290m through the transfer, at an inflated price, of the ownership of Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, from Ford of Britain direct to the US parent. Ford of Britain made losses of Pounds 935m in 1991 and Pounds 274m in 1990 however these were heavily influenced by losses from Jaguar. Excluding these, Ford of Britain incurred a loss of Pounds 487m in 1991 and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 61m in 1990, on a comparable basis with last year's pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m. This figure included a Pounds 68m restructuring charge for redundancies. Details, Page 25   Companies:-  Ford Motor.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Land Rover Defender, although equipped some years ago with the Range Rover's more civilised underpinnings, remains a working vehicle. Some might say it is now the smartest 4 x 4 of all in which to be seen because it implies, first, that you have broad acres and, second, that you suffer its discomforts gladly because you - or your men - must be able to drive to the furthest, muddiest parts of your estate loaded with straw bales or Fortnum's hampers. Capable though they are off road, most of the Shoguns and Troopers, Discoveries and Mavericks, Cherokees and Fronteras, Land Cruisers and Vitaras are seen on school runs and in supermarket car parks, not axle deep in mire. As Glass's Guide, the car trade's bible, noted the other day, these life-style on-off/roaders bucked the recession and sales are reaching new heights. They are bought by seekers after individuality, many of whom had found their beloved hot hatchbacks no longer insurable at sensible cost. The Daihatsu Fourtrak never really fitted the recreational mould, though. It was a worker, with simple leaf springs and a beefy diesel engine. Farmers love Fourtraks. You see a lot of them, battered and long suffering, hauling sheep trailers in the wilder parts of Britain. The life-style market is, however, too big to be ignored and Daihatsu wants a larger slice of it. So, the latest Fourtrak has independent front suspension, a coil sprung back axle, wheel arch extensions to accommodate fatter tyres, and a wider track. The car-like interior seats five, or seven if you sacrifice all luggage space. It still feels rugged, and it banged about resiliently on moorland tracks on the Isle of Man where I drove one recently. The on-road ride and handling are much better than before although, as the wheelbase is still fairly short, it is more inclined to pitch on minor roads than, say, a long wheelbase Shogun, Maverick or Frontera. One is more aware of its 2.8-litre, 100 horsepower turbo-diesel than in an ultra-refined, Nissan-built Ford Maverick or Terrano II. Not that this is likely to trouble the traditional kind of buyer who pulls a two-horse trailer; a Fourtrak tows up to 3,500 kg. Prices are Pounds 15,650 for a TDL, Pounds 16,895 for the better equipped TDX.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

Rover group, BAe's motor vehicles subsidiary, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government to lead the development of a national car project to design, develop and manufacture a small car for production in Indonesia. BAe also agreed yesterday to consider forming a joint venture to develop and manufacture regional turbopropeller aircraft with the Indonesian state-owned aerospace company PT Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN). With a population of almost 194m and an economy forecast to grow at more than 6 per cent a year in 1993 and 1994, Indonesia has long had ambitions to develop its car and aerospace sectors as part of the rapid industrialisation of south-east Asia. BAe said yesterday it had signed the two agreements after meetings in London with Dr Bacharrudin Habibie, the Indonesian minister for research and technology and chairman both of the Indonesian Agency for Strategic Industries and of IPTN. According to the motor industry memorandum, Rover will provide technology transfer and technical support to a joint small car programme. The car would be sold initially in the home market but subsequently would also be aimed at export markets. Production volumes would be up to 50,000 a year with output probably starting in 1996-97. It is understood that the car would be based on the chassis platform of the present Metro/Rover 100 and would be powered by Rover's 1.1 litre K-Series engine. In the early stages of the project Rover would supply mechanical components such as engines and gearboxes but the company said the ultimate aim was for the car to be completely manufactured in Indonesia. Rover would not take any equity stake in the project, and the strategic industries agency would be responsible for the financing, said the UK carmaker. Rover will head a group of five British companies developing the car jointly with the Indonesians, including TN, the engine components group; IAD, the automotive design and engineering consultancy; Mira, the automotive testing facility, and Inchcape, the international trading and motor retailing group, which is one of the leading independent car importer/distributors in Asia. Indonesia's plan for an indigenous car industry follows the success of neighbouring Malaysia in developing a national car, the Proton Saga, based on technology from Mitsubishi Motors of Japan.

0,FT934-10651 ,"FT934-10651 _AN-DKDC7ADYFT 931104   FT  04 NOV 93 / Leading Article: VW's 29 hours   GERMANY is struggling to adapt manufacturing employment to reduced demand for its high-cost goods. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, German unemployment will grow from 7.7 to 11.3 per cent of the workforce between 1992 and 1994 - a far bigger increase than in any other large industrial country. Volkswagen, the loss-making motor group, faces not only the general problems of German industry, but also some specific ones caused by inability to control costs during previous periods of capacity expansion. It is, however, not clear whether the company's radical proposal for a four-day week from January 1 maps out the route to recovery. Volkswagen says it needs to cut its 108,000-strong workforce to 72,000 by the end of 1995 - a consequence of stagnating sales and big productivity improvements. Labour reductions of this order can be avoided, VW maintains, only if employees agree both a 20 per cent cut in working hours - to 28.8 from 36 per week - and equivalent reductions in wages. The IG Metall trade union, which in the past has led an industry-wide drive for shorter hours, has ruled out 20 per cent pay cuts, but indicated willingness to compromise. Bound by a commitment to the Lower Saxony government, VW's largest shareholder, to maintain a 100,000-strong domestic workforce until the end of 1994, the company's chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, badly needs a deal. However, in his efforts to press through wage cuts, he holds strong negotiating cards. Germany's labour costs, having failed to adjust to straitened economic circumstances, are too high, while VW workers earn roughly 10 per cent more than in other German motor groups. The company may partly offset reductions in workers' living standards with cash which would have been deployed for redundancy programmes. Provided IG Metall agrees appropriate pay cuts, the plan could grant Volkswagen breathing space in which to work out longer-term arrangements for lowering costs. Yet unless the company can foresee a relatively speedy return to five-day working (at present unlikely), cuts in working hours will not be more than a short-term expedient for tackling the fundamental problem of over-manning and excess capacity. Such deals have only limited applications for companies in similar predicaments. They do not tackle the non-wage costs which represent an important burden on German companies. Additionally, across-the-board reductions in pay and hours, demanding equal cuts in living standards from all workers, irrespective of their productivity, could even counter the move to more flexible working practices which Germany urgently needs. German labour and management are showing welcome readiness to negotiate solutions to the country's industrial difficulties. But they are still only at the beginning of the adjustment process.

0,FT942-32 ,"FT942-32 _AN-EF3D2AGVFT 940630   FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (4): The Revenue gnashes its teeth / An examination of UK suppliers' changing price strategies      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Car makers were uneasy two years ago when the Inland Revenue unveiled its proposals for a new company car tax regime, based on a simple percentage of cars' list prices. In previous years considerable effort had gone into producing 'tax break specials' under the old tax regime, which heavily favoured high-earning executives compared with lower-paid essential users of company cars. The old system, based on price and engine capacity bands, meant that an executive driving a highly-specified 'perk' car of fractionally under 2 litres and Pounds 19,250 paid only the same personal tax on his company car as an essential user of a utilitarian vehicle of just over 1.4 litres, provided their marginal tax rates were the same. Under the new system, effective from April 6, the same executive would have to swap his Pounds 19,000 car for a model costing a mere Pounds 12,500 so that the tax bill would be the same. Car makers feared that many executives would be tempted to downsize and downprice, thus sapping revenue from one of the most profitable sectors of the new car market. Vehicles with many executive 'extras' provide disproportionately higher profit per unit compared with mainstream fleet cars. It will take two or three years before the effect of the new system, in terms of vehicle choice, can be fully assessed. Nevertheless, there is little sign so far of executives opting for less tax-burdensome cars, according to Mr Michael Banner, Vauxhall's director of fleet sales, and researchers at Henley Management College who have studied the executive and fleet car market on Vauxhall's behalf. While some preference is being shown for smaller cars - but only ones equipped to executive standards - there is only a very slight trend towards downpricing, the researchers maintain. Mr Banner observes that 'the typical executive driving a car priced at the old Pounds 19,250 tax threshold has looked at the changes, realised that his current car is going to cost him only another Pounds 20 or Pounds 30 a month and has decided 'I'll cope'.' Similar views are being voiced by other manufacturers. But that does not mean that significant changes in manufacturers' model mixes and marketing policies are not under way. One major effect of the new tax system was to eliminate entirely the engine capacity bands which previously had discriminated severely against larger units. Particularly badly hit under the old system was the diesel engine. Though likely to be favoured by many fleet managers because of its one-third greater fuel economy compared with a petrol unit, it typically reqires larger capacity to provide comparable on-road performance. The new tax system is already seeing the introduction of new versions of mainstream business cars with larger, high-performing V6 engines of 2.5 litres, as well as giving a further boost to the buoyant diesel car sector, sales of which in the first four months of this year were running 60 per cent higher than in the same period of 1993. The diesel sales go on despite two learned reports in the UK, which argue that diesel exhaust emissions - including particulates suspected of causing cancer - could contaminate the air in cities if the diesel car population continues to expand. One in four new cars sold in the UK is now a diesel. Business car users and fleet managers, increasingly impressed by the cost advantages, appear to be taking comfort from the fact that commercial vehicles - many of them elderly buses - account for at least two-thirds of the diesel exhaust pollution being created in urban areas. It is not only at the Pounds 19,250 tax break point that the tax system changes are having an effect. The scrapping of the second threshold of Pounds 29,000, above which an executive's personal tax on his company car rose sharply, has eliminated model range 'bunching' around the breakpoint while the capping of the new system at a Pounds 60,000 list price means that the expensive car makers such as Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin are not significantly disadvantaged. It is in pricing structures and strategies that the new tax system has had some of its most notable effects - at least in terms of the notional prices which are paid for executives' cars. Traditional UK pricing policies - with a few exceptions such as Mercedes and BMW - have been based on a relatively high list price which few customers in the business sector actually pay. There are widespread discounts - 30 per cent or more in a few notorious deals to particularly large fleet operators. The new list price-based tax regime makes such policies untenable because they would maximise an executive's personal tax burden. So manufacturers have been cutting the profit margins they allow their dealers. Once typically 15-16.5 per cent, plus the chance of cash bonuses from manufacturers for meeting sales targets, these 'official' margins have been cut to 10 per cent and in some cases - over the past few weeks in the executive sector - to 5 per cent. Indeed, Vauxhall's new Omega executive car range was launched with a 5 per cent margin. In a few cases, the margin has been dispended with altogther in favour of a fixed 'handling' charge payable to the dealer. Some Renault and Volvo models fall into this category. So do some of the cheapest Rover 800 models with a Pounds 500 fee, while Ford is allowing a Pounds 1,500 handling fee on its US-built Probe coupe and is giving only a token margin on its Granada/Scorpio executive cars. The changes have been accompanied by much trumpeting about lower prices. This is convenient in view of the pan-EU car price comparisons now published twice a year at the behest of the European Commission, which wants to see price convergence between EU new car markets and tends to regard the UK as a high-priced market. But transaction prices have not changed a lot because dealers were already giving away much of their official margin and relying on incentive bonuses from manufacturers to make a return on mainstream executive cars. They now merely have less room to haggle. The approach does mean a lower company car tax burden for executives - and a lower tax take for the Inland Revenue. At the moment, the Revenue can only stand by gnashing its teeth. How it might react, in the longer term, to an entrenched system of zero profit margins and 'handling charges' is another matter altogether.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT932-3414 ,"FT932-3414 _AN-DFOCRAHCFT 930614   FT  14 JUN 93 / General Motors warns VW over Spanish plant      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   GENERAL MOTORS of the US has warned Volkswagen of further legal action if it goes ahead with plans for a revolutionary ultra-low-cost car production plant in Spain. A letter delivered at the weekend to Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the German group, said a 'similar' project was prepared by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua while he was still employed by General Motors. The warning was sent as Mr Lopez prepared to hold his first press conferences since he defected from the US group to VW in March. In two appearances today, in Hanover and later in Madrid, Mr Lopez is expected to announce that Volkswagen will build a new super-lean production plant in his Basque homeland, where cars can be built in less than half the time needed in the average European factory. Last week Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, said 'some especially interesting' proposals had been put forward from regional authorities. The GM letter represents a further step in the US group's campaign against Mr Lopez, which is focused on charges, now under investigation by public prosecutors in Germany, that he and several of his associates took top secret industrial, model and marketing plans with them when they went to VW. While still at GM, Mr Lopez shrouded his proposals for the so-called Plateau 6 works in secrecy. Numbered copies of all plans, including draft factory drawings and car model designs, are still in the possession of the US group's top executives. Mr Lopez campaigned fiercely at GM for his Plateau 6 plant to be built in his homeland, where he retains strong political connections. The US group's refusal to comply, and its preference for any future investments to be made in eastern Europe where costs are below those in the European Community, are understood to be the main reasons for his stormy departure from Detroit in March. The Plateau 6 concept is aimed at improving production efficiency beyond the levels achieved by Japanese manufacturers. The proposals include plans for component suppliers to ship complete modules rather than single parts into the works where their employees would install them in vehicles. Other concepts include a wide range of differential pay rates for car assembly staff, breaking with the standard practice of paying all line operators the same basic wage. Last month GM suffered its first important loss in its legal battle against VW. An initial attempt to prevent seven former employees of GM and Adam Opel, the US group's German subsidiary, from working for VW for 12 months was thrown out by a Frankfurt court. The seven included former top members of Mr Lopez's buying team at GM, who left the US shortly after their boss.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Volkswagen.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

Simply put, the IM240, purge, and pressure tests are so effective that a biennial test program will yield almost the same emission reduction benefits as an annual program.

Furthermore, the types of repairs needed to pass these high-technology tests are substantive and durable_something which is not always the case with repairs aimed at passing an idle-based I/M program.     (f) Waivers and Special Warranty Protection. The FIP I/M program would include the opportunity for owners of failing vehicles to apply for a cost waiver once they have spent at least $450, adjusted annually for inflation, in relevant emission control repairs. The $450 figure is required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for state-adopted, enhanced I/M programs. While EPA is not required to include such a waiver limit in this FIP, EPA is proposing this waiver limit because it is practical, ensures repair of virtually all failures, and will simplify the transition once California adopts its own program. The $450 figure will be adjusted annually, based upon the difference between the Consumer Price Index for the current year and that of a 1990 base year, and would not include costs related to the repair of tampering-related defects or emission control components the servicing of which are covered by an unexpired warranty. The test provider(s) would be responsible for issuing such waivers and for conducting a visual inspection to confirm that all claimed repairs have, in fact, been made. Motorists on public assistance would be able to apply for a one-time, non- renewable time extension on making repairs, not to exceed one full test cycle. Only one such time extension will be granted per the lifetime of a vehicle.     The California Motor Vehicle Control Program provides for warranties similar to those included under Federal law. These warranties would be available to owners of failed vehicles up to the specified age and mileage limitations which vary depending on the model year of the vehicle. Special warranty protection would be available to owners of vehicles certified under the proposed enhanced in-use compliance program for model year 1999 and newer vehicles (see Section III.D.2.d).     (g) Enforcement and Oversight. Under the FIP I/M program, it would be a violation of Federal law for the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), its employees, or any other representative of the State of California to register any vehicle subject to the FIP's I/M requirement for which a valid certificate of compliance or waiver (either paper-based or electronic) has not been presented. DMV employees or other State representatives suspected of violating the FIP I/M requirement would be subject to prosecution under Federal law and, if found guilty, could be subject to civil penalties up to $25,000 per violation. Each instance of unlawful registration would be considered a separate offense.     Motorists who were late for either regularly scheduled tests or who failed to comply with an out-of-cycle test required because the vehicle was identified by a remote sensing unit (see below), would be assessed a late fee at the rate of $10 per week late. EPA requests comments on other means of enforcing program requirements, including the possibility of tying penalty fees to the length of violation multiplied by the level of excess emissions.     (h) Convenience Issues. EPA would make customer convenience an important criteria in entering into any legal agreement with a test provider(s). Minimum convenience requirements would be established and addressed. For example, EPA intends to require in any such agreement that test stations be sited such that 80 percent of all subject motorists are within a 5 mile radius of a test station, with 95 percent of all motorists within a 10 mile radius. Wait times between entering a test station queue and the initiation of actual testing would be tracked and would not be allowed to exceed 15 minutes on average. Scheduling individual vehicles for tests would be required to be done on a weekly basis, as opposed to monthly, to help reduce the impact of the end-of-the-month rush. To avoid being assessed a late penalty, motorists would have to report for testing sometime during the scheduled testing week, with the week beginning on Sunday and ending on Saturday. The test provider(s) would be allowed to use late fees paid by motorists who do not show up during the specified test week to either create an incentive program to stimulate off-peak test lane usage or to expand capacity. The test provider(s) would also be required to offer ``valet testing'' for a reasonable fee. Such an option would allow motorists to have their vehicles picked up for testing from their homes, work places, etc., and returned.        "
0,FT944-17691 ,"FT944-17691 _AN-EJGDBAAGFT 941007   FT  07 OCT 94 / Rover will renew assault on N America in push for sales      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Rover-produced cars will return to the North American market despite the sales failure of its Sterling-badged cars at the end of the 1980s, the chairman of BMW, Rover's parent company, said yesterday. Rovers, rather than BMWs, will also lead the German-owned group's drive into Asian markets such as China, where explosive growth is forecast over the coming decade, said BMW chairman Mr Berndt Pischetsrieder. In his first wide-ranging assessment of Rover group since BMW acquired Rover from British Aerospace for Pounds 800m in January, Mr Pischetsrieder also: Held out the prospect of tripartite co-operation between BMW, Rover and Honda - Rover's close associate under BAe ownership - wherever in the world joint projects were felt to be of mutual benefit. Made clear that BMW saw no upper limits on car production by Rover or any reason why Rover-designed products should not be produced at assembly plants overseas. Confirmed that BMW is serious in its intent to revive names from the past, such as Riley and Austin-Healey, for niche market products. Indicated that there was virtually no chance of BMW reviving past negotiations seeking to buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the Vickers-owned luxury carmaker - 'although I have learned in this industry if you say never you can be wrong'. Mr Pischetsrieder set out no time scale or product plans for Rover cars to return to North America. The group has made a success of its Land Rover four-wheel-drive operations in North America but it has twice had to admit defeat in the car market, withdrawing for the first time in the 1970s and again after the Sterling debacle in 1991. But 'it is unlikely that any manufacturer will be around in the years 2005-2010 if it is not present in all major world markets - so, yes, Rover will be relaunched in the US', Mr Pischetsrieder said. He gave no details of BMW's precise strategy for Asia. However, Rover, with its smaller models and front-wheel-drive technology was an obvious choice for such markets, he declared. BMW as a brand was too narrow and upmarket in its model range. He made clear that past tensions with Honda over Rover's takeover had now disappeared. As Honda itself has sought to emphasise, its anger over the sale of Rover - with which Honda had cross-shareholdings - was directed at BAe for selling, not BMW for buying, the UK carmaker. Collaboration with Honda beyond current contracts with Rover, which last up to the year 2000, could now be contemplated. Mr Pischetsrieder also said the Mini, now in its 36th year, may continue in production past the end of the century if efforts to develop a replacement were felt to have failed.

0,FT944-14198 ,"FT944-14198 _AN-EJXDSAD4FT 941024   FT  24 OCT 94 / VW eases concern on Skoda cuts: Czech government asks German carmaker to amend plans to scale down production      By JOE COOK and ANDREW FISHER      PRAGUE, FRANKFURT   Volkswagen, the German motor group, has moved to calm Czech anger over the scaling down of its production targets for the Skoda carmaker by promising to meet some of the Prague government's objections. VW and the Czech government said yesterday they were confident that talks over the German group's revised plans for Skoda, based north of Prague, could be concluded this year. The statement came after Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's chairman, met Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech industry and trade minister, in Prague on Saturday. The government is mainly concerned over VW's decision to scale down annual production from a previous target of 400,000 cars to 300,000 cars by the year 2000. Although VW gave no details of the meeting, it is understood the extent of the scale-down may be reduced in line with Czech objections. The two sides said further talks would be held on amending VW's original plans. VW owns 31 per cent of Skoda, scheduled to rise to 50.5 per cent this year. Under a 1991 agreement, VW is due to increase its stake in Skoda to 70 per cent by the end of 1995 at a total cost of DM1.4bn (Pounds 575m) - the biggest foreign investment in the Czech Republic. VW promised to invest a further DM6.8bn over 10 years in Skoda to introduce new models, double production to 400,000 cars by 2000 and build a plant to produce 400,000 engines a year, half for other VW subsidiaries. But because of losses at Seat, its Spanish subsidiary, VW said the proposed engine plant was no longer feasible and it would cut investment to DM3.75bn. Mr Dlouhy suggested that the German company had violated the spirit of the contract and said he would seek an amendment which would require VW to fulfil its promise. Mr Dlouhy said before the meeting with Mr Piech that he expected by the end of October to sign 'a amendment to the contract that will put VW and the Czech government on an even footing'. The talks come a week after 10,000 workers at Skoda's factory in Mlada Boleslav, north of Prague, staged a one-hour strike over plans to make 855 employees redundant, and days before the company launches its new Felicia car, Skoda's first new product since 1988. Also under discussion will be VW's plans to import engines for some versions of the Felicia and to put employees of Skoda parts suppliers on its assembly lines. Mr Jan Uhlir, who as chairman of the Kovo Trade Union which represents most of Skoda's 17,000 workers, has been in talks with the Skoda-VW management.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

The companies also promised to increase imports into Japan. Separately, the ministry of international trade and industry announced it was ending its voluntary cap on car exports to the US because it had been made redundant by local manufacture of Japanese cars in the US. The cap was introduced in 1981 to protect the US motor industry. About 1.54m vehicles will be built by Japanese manufacturers in the US in 1994, the first year they will exceed exports to the US of cars produced in Japan. These are expected to reach nearly 1.4m units. Japanese exports have been under the ceilings set by the voluntary agreement since 1987. The announcements come as the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association revealed that Japan's motor exports in February had fallen 23.5 per cent in unit terms compared with the same month last year. The figure was down 2.6 per cent on the preceding month. In dollar terms, exports, including parts, dropped 7.9 per cent to Dollars 6.85bn. Japanese car, bus and truck makers have been struggling with the high value of the yen which has made their products increasingly uncompetitive. The car makers' undertakings on parts follow sustained pressure from Washington for Japan to increase use of US vehicle components to reduce Japan's trade surplus. Only 2 per cent of motor parts are imported. The Japanese government insists it is unable to interfere in private business. Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi have already revealed similar programmes. Combined, the five groups have committed themselves to increasing US parts purchases by more than Dollars 5.3bn by the financial year ending March 1998. Honda said it planned to increase the use of US parts at its Marysville, Ohio plant from Dollars 3.21bn in the 1992 financial year to Dollars 4.65bn during the 1995 financial year. It would also raise imports of vehicles and parts from Dollars 1.07bn to Dollars 1.27bn between 1992 and 1995. However, the group said that while it would make every effort to achieve such goals, it was not an enforceable commitment. 'Successful achievement of the goal depends on maintaining strong sales in the US and continued improvements in US suppliers' competitiveness,' it said. Mazda announced it would increase imports of components into Japan from Dollars 560m last financial year to Dollars 870m by the year ending March 1998. Over the same period local procurement of parts at its American factory would increase from Dollars 1.65bn to Dollars 1.9bn.   Companies:-  Honda Motor.     Mazda Motor Corp.

0,FT941-11122 ,"FT941-11122 _AN-EBFAAAEFFT 940205   FT  05 FEB 94 / Motoring: In the third estate      By STUART MARSHALL   Vauxhall's Astra and Ford's Escort have had it all theirown way in Britain's lower-medium estate car market. Last year, the Astra took 53.2 per cent of sales and the Escort 37.5 per cent. The only other estate to score more than 1,000 sales was - would you believe? - the Lada Riva. Things are about to change, though. Citroen's ZX estate will go on sale in the UK onMarch 1, while the Volkswagen Golf and Rover 400 estates are not far behind. There will be three ZX estates. Two are Avantage models with a 1.4-litre, 75-horsepower petrol engine or a 1.9-litre, 71hp diesel. The other is an Aura model witha 92hp, 1.9-litre turbo-diesel. All have identical five-door bodies 8in (20 cm) longer than the ZX hatchbacks, which have themselves become Britain's best-selling Citroens, with more than 75,000 registrations since their launch 30 months ago. Built-in roof-rack side rails, remote-control central locking and power-operated slide/tilt sun roof and front windows are standard. Keen prices are expected to range from less than Pounds 11,000 for the petrol Avantage to under Pounds 12,750 for the turbo-diesel with power steering. Uniquely, the 1.9-litre diesel (but not the turbo-diesel) will be available with automatic transmission instead ofmanual gears at no extra cost. The petrol-engined Avantage and turbo-diesel Aura estates I sampled rode a shade more firmly than their hatchback counterparts because the rear suspension has been up-rated to cope with payloads of more than 1,100lb. (500 kg). But they were just as comfortable, and a small amount of passive rear-wheel steering made them feel as nimble as ever when cornering or lane-changing. It is easy to hump things aboard a ZX estate because thetailgate opens to below bumper-top level and the wheel arches intrude very little into the flat-floored load space. A Citroen accessory dog guard does not get in the way of the load space cover and can be folded down when not needed. Last year, nearly half the British buyers of lower-medium estates chose diesel, which was twice the total for hatchbacks and saloons of similar size and price. Introduction of the ZX estates must lift the figure far higher because, good though the petrol version is, the diesels are the ones to go for. The 111 mph (178 kph) Aura turbo-diesel is the fastest, has the best acceleration and, at a constant 56 mph (90 kph), is the most frugal (64.2 mpg/4.4 1itres per 100 km); you can have your cake and eat it.

0,FT933-7708 ,"FT933-7708 _AN-DHTCQAANFT 930820   FT  20 AUG 93 / Rexrodt seeks road to peace for car makers      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   MR Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, has had almost three weeks in which to reconsider his impulsive hint that he might be prepared to act as middleman in the industrial espionage row between Volkswagen and Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors. On Tuesday night he was given food for thought in an hour-long meeting with Mr David Herman, the beguilingly mild Opel chairman. They had a 'good talk' on matters of a 'non-communicable nature', according to official statements. The minister will hear from VW's Mr Ferdinand Piech at a similar private session today. Signs of potential misunderstandings were already apparent as this week's meetings were announced. Mr Rexrodt's office was careful to stress that the minister's aim was to gather information, while VW tried to suggest the talks were in some way a continuation of Mr Piech's own peace-making initiatives. These started with an abortive attempt to heal the breach with Mr Jack Smith, GM president, after a nasty exchange at the end of last month. The VW chairman's suggestions at a press conference, laced with war-like, xenophobic overtones, that Opel secrets had been 'planted' on his new employees and in VW computers, had earned him the riposte from GM that his ideas were grotesque and that his grasp on reason might be less than secure. A telephone call to Mr Smith was rewarded with the cold shoulder. Mr Piech might communicate in writing with Mr Herman, but he had to retract his charges first, he was told. A telephone call from Mr Piech to Mr Rexrodt, who had appealed for more moderate language and warned against damaging Germany's international image, was the cue for this week's interviews. Both sides, the government, and other German motor makers have reason to be worried. Although it is understood Washington does not see any immediate danger to inter-governmental relations, the fact that the US Justice Department has begun an investigation into the case is reason enough for concern. Future US sales prospects for German car makers, not least VW itself, may also be at stake. BMW and Mercedes-Benz are at or beyond the point of no return on their first-ever investments in US car plants. Mr Rexrodt is also confronted by a mood approaching panic in some sectors of the domestic vehicle components industry, caused partly by VW's draconian price-cutting demands. However much the minister may wish for calm, his half-hearted mediation offer came too late. Mr Rexrodt appears to believe that it is best if both sides agree to keep quiet and let the criminal investigations proceed. Volkswagen pre-empted his wishes last weekend when it said it was withdrawing from the war of words.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Adam Opel.     General Motors Corp.

0,FT943-6482 ,"FT943-6482 _AN-EH2B3AC8FT 940829   FT  29 AUG 94 / VW's big hopes for small car: Kevin Done reports on the German carmaker's efforts to catch up      By KEVIN DONE   Several thousand Volkswagen dealers from across Europe are converging on a Paris race course in the Bois de Boulogne this week. It is not for a flutter on the horses, however, but for the high pressure launch of the new VW Polo, which the German carmaker hopes its dealers will soon be selling in sufficient numbers to transform VW from an also-ran in west Europe's fiercely competitive small car market into a front-runner. The VW group, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, may be Europe's biggest carmaker, but as an individual brand VW is ranked only third behind the Opel make (Vauxhall in the UK) of General Motors and Ford. In the small car segment of the market, VW languished in sixth place with the old Polo last year. As the car bumped along to the end of its life-cycle, its sales dropped by 39.8 per cent to only 186,000, according to Automotive Industry Data, the UK-based analysts. Sales of the market-leading Ford Fiesta were more than double Polo sales at 452,000. VW has a lot of ground to make up. Even though it will have the newest car in the market, it is up against tough opposition with both GM and Fiat having made launches in the past 18 months in the shape of the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa and the Fiat Punto. It is vital for VW to achieve a breakthrough in this segment, where superminis (Fiesta, Corsa, Punto etc) and minis (Fiat Cinquecento, Fiat Panda, Renault Twingo etc) account for 31 per cent of all the new cars sold in Europe. With the new Polo, VW dealers will be able to meet the competition on a more level playing field. Its predecessor was long overdue for replacement having been launched 13 years ago, and VW had never properly met the demands of the market-place. VW's UK import subsidiary maintains that with the old model Polo, it could only cover 29 per cent of the market-place. With the new car it will be able to cover virtually the entire market and offer for the first time a host of features common among rival models, such as five doors, automatic transmission, anti-lock braking, power-assisted steering, driver and passenger airbags, air conditioning, central locking and electric windows. Mr Dieter Dahlhoff, director of marketing for the VW brand, says: 'We want to make the new Polo into a real high volume model and to use it to open doors to new customers.' The group is aiming to increase sales of the Polo to at least 350,000 in 1995. Most of the output will come from VW's Spanish plant at Pamplona with output next year targeted to reach at least 1,040 a day on two shifts with the ability to rise to 1,200 a day. The car will be built at VW's main plant at Wolfsburg at the rate of 530 a day. While ambitious for Volkswagen, these targets appear modest against the aims of its bitter rival General Motors, with which it is still locked in controversy over GM allegations of industrial espionage. Opel is raising Corsa production at its Eisenach plant in eastern Germany to 640 a day on a three-shift operation. Combined with its main Corsa plant at Zaragoza, Spain, this will raise total production for the range to 2,400 a day. The Polo must also help to bring VW down to a lower cost base, so that the heavily loss-making German group can start to rid itself of its unenviable position as Europe's high-cost carmaker. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW management board, claims the hours taken to build the new Polo have been cut by about 15 per cent (on a comparable basis to the old Polo) to 16 hours per car. The new car is also an important element in the group's platform strategy aimed at cutting costs and simplifying its global manufacturing activities. It is planning to reduce the number of basic chassis platforms from 16 earlier this year to four by early next decade. The Polo platform will spawn all other small car models in the VW group for the next decade, including Seat and Skoda. According to Mr Ulrich Seiffert, VW group research and development director, the new Polo shares about 40 per cent of its components, by value, with its half-sister, the Seat Ibiza, launched early last year. The Ibiza and the Polo share dashboards, as well as rear axle and suspension, and some engines and gearboxes. VW is developing its first mini car, smaller than the Polo, code-named the EA420 and due for launch in Europe by late 1996. Based on a shortened Polo platform and to be produced at Wolfsburg, it is supposed to be the car that proves VW can assemble cars in Germany as cost effectively as any carmaker in Europe. It is a big task for a small car, but such rationalisation is crucial as the VW group seeks to claw its way back into the black following last year's record losses of DM1.9bn.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- New VW Polo entres a fiercely competitive market  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Car market segments in West Europe 1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Basic cars (Fiat 500  Panda, Renault Twingo etc.)                           5.1%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small cars (Ford Fiesta, Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, Fiat Punto etc.)              25.9%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lower medium cars (VW Golf, Opel/Vauxhall Astra, Ford Escort etc.)                 33.6%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Upper medium cars (Ford Mondeo, Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier etc.)                18.3%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Executive cars (BMW 3/5 series, Volvo 800, Opel/Vauxhall Omega etc.)            10.5%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Others (Luxury, sports cars and coupes, sports/utility, MPVs)            6.6%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total market                                                   11.428m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small car market shares in West Europe 1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total market                    2,949,300          100% Ford Fiesta                       452,409         15.3% Renault Clio                      441,483         15.0% Fiat Uno/Punto                    400,554         13.6% Opel/Vauxhall Corsa               352,693         12.0% Peugeot 106                       272,547          9.2% VW Polo                           186,377          6.3% Citroen AX                        161,127          5.5% Nissan Micra                      135,379          4.6% Seat Ibiza/Cordoba                131,272          4.5% Peugeot 205                       129,089          4.4% Others                                  -          9.6%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Automotive Industry Data  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

0,FT944-8232 ,"FT944-8232 _AN-EKUDAAD8FT 941121   FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: VW revises Skoda production plan      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   Volkswagen, the German carmaker, has agreed to raise the production capacity of Skoda, its Czech affiliate, to 340,000 units a year by the late 1990s from about 230,000 at present. The deal, initialled by VW and the Czech government on Friday, has won Prague's backing for a revised development plan for Skoda and includes a commitment to develop further the Czech car components industry. It opens the way for Volkswagen to raise its 31 per cent minority holding to 60.3 per cent by the end of December - including the conversion of preference stock into ordinary voting shares - and to 70 per cent by the end of 1995. VW will have paid DM1.4bn in three tranches for the 70 per cent stake - DM200m (Dollars 129m) to the Czech government for the acquisition of part of its holding and DM1.2bn in new equity capital for Skoda. Renegotiation of the contract, which was agreed in 1991 and gave VW management control, was forced by VW's withdrawal, without warning last autumn, from a DM1.4bn project finance facility for Skoda. The move caused consternation in Prague, which has been seeking reassurance ever since about the level of VW's commitment to Skoda. In early 1991, VW had said it planned capital investments totalling DM9.5bn for Skoda by the end of the decade, that it would more than double Skoda's production capacity to about 390,000 cars a year and would build a new engine plant. Under the revised deal VW has won approval for a more modest capacity expansion, and has dropped the engine plant plan. The current capital spending plan totals around DM3.7bn from 1991 to 2000, but this could be reduced if VW can find additional investment cost savings. Under the new agreement VW's plans include: Development of a second car range for Skoda due for launch in 1996-97, code-named A+. The larger Skoda range will be derived from the VW group's so-called 'A' platform, which will also form the basis for the next generation VW Golf in the late 1990s and be used initially for a new range of small Audis - the group's up-market brand - due for launch in mid-1996. A new paint plant at Skoda's main production facility at Mlada Boleslav. It will have a capacity for 1,300 cars a day, or 307,000 a year. A new assembly plant for the second car range with a capacity in the first phase for 70,000 cars a year, which could be raised to 90,000 a year.

Yesterday's long-awaited Commission draft document setting out the industry's further exemption from normal EU competition rules was greeted with cautious relief by carmakers and dealers but consumer groups reacted angrily. The Commission claimed that proposed changes to the terms of the exemption would make it easier for consumers to seek the best deals in any EU country, and would increase competition in car sales and servicing. But consumer groups claimed that they would 'do nothing' for buyers. The changes include a provision for dealers to be allowed to sell more than one make of car - but only from separate sites under separate management; for dealers to be allowed to buy spare parts from makers other than the car manufacturers and to advertise outside the territory allocated to them; for independent repairers to have access to manufacturers' technical information; and measures to remove obstacles to cross-border trading. However, manufacturers will still be able to choose which dealers they supply, and the dealers will retain exclusive franchises within clearly defined sales territories for 10 more years after the industry's current 'block exemption' from EU competition rules expires on June 1. The document was described by the Commission as the best way of serving consumer interests through safeguarding standards of sales and servicing for a complex product with important safety considerations. Ms Valerie Thompson, head of communications at BEUC, the European Consumers' Organisation, said: 'They are small steps but they have not gone far enough . . . the main consumer benefit of going to one showroom and being able to compare rival makes of car, quality and prices would not be allowed.' Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer of Fiat, the Italian carmaker, and president of ACEA, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, expressed concern that some of the proposals 'would represent a significant additional cost burden and would lead to greater undue complexity' for makers and dealers. The carmakers are unhappy that, despite the restrictions on sites and managements, the proposed rules open the door to the creation of multi-franchise dealer groups. Mr Robert Blower of the UK's multi-franchise Cowie Group welcomed the document as a significant shift in the balance of power towards dealers away from manufacturers. 'The ability to advertise outside territories, use independent suppliers' parts and multi-franchise gives us most of the things dealers have been looking for from the review,' he said.

0,FT941-5410 ,"FT941-5410 _AN-ECGC1AB3FT 940307   FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Challenge from the periphery - Case Study: GM / A Hungarian auto plant that sets quality standards for the west      By DAVID MARSH   Szentgotthard in western Hungary is a strategic crossing point for the flux of products, capital and ideas streaming across the widening European market. This unprepossessing town close to the Austrian border was sealed off before 1989 by the cold war insignia of barbed wire and watch towers. Now it is a test-bed for western manufacturing techniques. In a Dollars 250m plant in the shell of a communist-built farm equipment factory, General Motors has been assembling cars and engines since 1992. GM has profited from a five-year tax holiday and a Dollars 25m Hungarian investment grant. Other motor groups with footholds in Hungary include Suzuki, Ford and Audi. By setting new standards for low-cost production with up-to-date technology, such investments are helping spur the cross-border rationalisation and cost-cutting that are potent realities of the European market. Mr Ernst Hofmann, the moustachioed 63-year-old managing director of General Motors Hungary, describes how GM has designated Szentgotthard-produced engines as a quality benchmark throughout the group. Mr Hofmann - a veteran production specialist from GM's Opel subsidiary in Germany - praises the '100 per cent flexibility' of his 480-strong Hungarian workforce. Productivity and quality are at least as high as in comparable west European plants, he says. The Hungarian factory has a bearing on GM's larger plants in western Europe. 'We are competition for decision-making in the west.' At the equivalent of DM300 a month, workers at the factory earn one-eighth of the pay of those in GM's west German car plants. The GM assembly plant this year should produce about 11,000 Astra Opel hatchback cars and 140,000 engines, assembled from knock-down kits from west Germany. Labour accounts for less than 10 per cent of total costs, with materials making up 80 per cent. The share of local Hungarian production is about 10 per cent. Mr Hofmann believes this could eventually rise to 30 per cent as Hungarian component producers increase production. Last year, the plant exported 3,500 cars out of its 13,400 production - an uneconomic exercise at present, in view of the high cost of transporting components to Hungary. At least until 1996, the car plant is likely to operate at below its 15,000 per year capacity. By contrast, the engine plant is planned by end-1994 to be operating at full capacity of 200,000 engines per year. By introducing an extra shift, Mr Hofmann reckons Szentgotthard's capacity could be doubled with little extra investment. The importance of this plant and others like it in eastern Europe is far greater than their small size. West European car-makers will have to fight hard to beat the east European challenge.

0,FT943-8558 ,"FT943-8558 _AN-EHQE6AAEFT 940817   FT  17 AUG 94 / Rover plans investment of Pounds 1.5bn for new models      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   Rover Group, the leading UK carmaker and a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, is planning to develop a range of smaller Land Rover four-wheel-drive vehicles as part of a five-year new model investment plan. The group is aiming to increase investment to around Pounds 1.5bn in the next five years from the Pounds 1.2bn spent on model development in the previous five years, said Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive. 'We are now openly committed to increasing our investment in the next cycle of new models,' he said. The group has spent around Pounds 300m to develop a luxury Range Rover to be launched as a flagship for the group in the autumn, but it is understood that Rover is seeking to expand its presence in the fast growing world market for four-drive sports/utility vehicles, where it is already the leading European manufacturer. Land Rover, the group's specialist four-wheel-drive division, is planning to launch a vehicle range, probably in 1997, positioned below its current Range Rover and Discovery ranges and designed to appeal to younger car buyers. Such a vehicle would compete with rivals such as the Suzuki Vitara and the recently launched Toyota RAV4. Mr Towers said that 'Land Rover should be part of creating opportunities for people further down the range'. 'It is sensible and right to consider a business proposal to allow Land Rover to spread its net and create an ability below Discovery prices to attract people into the Land Rover fold.' The Discovery itself, currently priced in the UK between Pounds 17,600 and Pounds 26,800, has already transformed Land Rover's fortunes and has opened up new market segments since it was launched in 1989 to complement the luxury Range Rover and the utility Defender ranges. It accounted for 50 per cent of Land Rover sales last year. 'We have a further opportunity to invite people to get involved below the Discovery, but not far below,' said Mr Towers. Total Land Rover sales jumped by 30 per cent last year to a record 73,527 from 56,450 in 1992, and Land Rover output has increased further by 35 per cent to 43,600 in the first six months of this year, helped by the launch of the Discovery in the US last spring. Land Rover sales in the US in the first seven months of the year have more than doubled to 5,640 from 2,572 in the corresponding period a year ago. The Land Rover division was one of the main attractions for BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker, which paid Pounds 800m to acquire the Rover group early this year.

0,FT941-12106 ,"FT941-12106 _AN-EBADGAEDFT 940201   FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Unions seek jobs reassurance - Workers react      By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and TIM BURT   Union leaders yesterday sought reassurances from Rover that workers at the group's seven sites would not face cutbacks or involuntary redundancies following the BMW acquisition. The deal, however, appeared to enjoy support from workers on the Rover factory floor in contrast to the more cautious approach of union leaders. Rover directors, expected to address workforce meetings today, are also being urged to give undertakings that the deal will not mean plant closures. Calls to protect working practices for more than 30,000 members of the TGWU general, AEEU engineering and MSF white-collar unions were led by the Trades Union Congress. Mr John Monks, general secretary, said: 'The TUC will be supporting the unions in Rover in securing real guarantees from BMW that jobs will not be threatened and that research and development and component supply will remain in the UK.' His comment followed warnings from the International Metalworkers Federation that BMW could try to impose new practices on Rover workers. The Zurich-based federation, whose members include IG Metall, the union at BMW, said the company had good relations with its German workforce but had taken an anti-union stance in the US. The federation's warning prompted calls for further safeguards from the AEEU, which represents some 6,000 Rover workers. Mr John Allen, the union's chief negotiator at Rover, said: 'Our first priority must be the workforce, and we would like some assurances as to long-term job security.' Yesterday, however, workers coming off shift at Rover's Solihull plant - home to Land-Rover production - did not appear as concerned as their union leaders. Those prepared to comment expressed no hostility to the new holding company. Mr Dale Clarke, a maintenance supervisor, described BMW's planned acquisition as 'a good move forward for us.' He said: 'It's also good we're keeping the links with Honda. So the future looks rosy.' Mr Steve Pitchford, a setter operator for 25 years, was more equivocal. 'I want to know more facts. But BMW is a good company which makes good models. The announcement could be for the best. As long as it keeps me in employment, I don't mind.' That pragmatic approach was not universal. Mr John Doyle, an assembly fitter for 15 years, branded the deal 'a bit of a sell-out. I think BMW is after this place; they're not interested in the cars.'

0,FT933-9694 ,"FT933-9694 _AN-DHIDBAEDFT 930807   FT  07 AUG 93 / VW says recruits destroyed GM papers      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN last night said that former General Motors employees, who joined VW in March, brought or had sent to Germany documents containing possibly 'critical information'. But it said the men destroyed the documents to avoid any danger they might find their way into VW's possession. VW's supervisory board, which oversees management of the German car group, debated its row with GM over allegations of industrial espionage at an extraordinary meeting that lasted late into the evening. VW said the discussion was based on an 'explanation of the facts' sent by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to prosecutors investigating allegations of espionage against him and three colleagues. Mr Lopez switched from GM to VW as production director in mid-March, and was followed by his colleagues. There were no findings to warrant accusations of espionage, VW said, and the board restated its trust in Mr Lopez. It also stressed the group's claims that no secret documents came into VW's possession from its new employees. The carefully worded VW statement made no connections between the documents and any specific staff. But its contents appeared to confirm eye-witness reports of shredders working all night in mid-April in a house in Wiesbaden. The house was occupied at the time by Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Mr Rosario Piazza, two former employees of Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, and associates of Mr Lopez, who joined him at VW on March 22. In June, four removal company boxes, filled with papers and other data, including details of a top-secret mini-car to be built by Opel, were discovered in the house and handed over to police. Some of the data had been assembled at the specific request of Mr Lopez. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, last week implied GM could have planted secrets in the boxes to incriminate former employees. The VW statement also revealed that documents had been destroyed at a hotel, believed to be near Wolfsburg, the VW headquarters. 'In Wiesbaden, as well as in the Rothehof guesthouse, the former GM employees took pains to ensure that documents which could possibly be traced to GM and could contain critical information were destroyed to avoid the danger of their being distributed within Volkswagen,' the statement said. Over the past few months, VW has vigorously contested Opel's claims that any secrets were involved in the affair. Speaking after the hurriedly called meeting of the supervisory board, Mr Piech said VW made a loss of DM355m (Pounds 140m) in the second quarter of the current financial year, bringing the total deficit for the first half to DM1.6bn. But the company said it could achieve a turn-round by the end of the year. GM cost-cutting on track, Page 10   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     General Motors Corp.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT942-17585 ,"FT942-17585 _AN-EDCACAC1FT 940402   FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Renault beats forecasts with FFr1.07bn profit      By JOHN RIDDING      PARIS   Renault, the French state-owned vehicle group, suffered a sharp fall in profits last year, but managed to achieve a net result of FFr1.07bn (Dollars 186m) despite the contraction in the European car market. Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman, forecast improved earnings in the current year. The result for last year, which compares with net profits of FFr5.68bn in 1992, was higher than most industry analysts had forecast. Mr Schweitzer said it demonstrated the competitiveness of the company in the midst of depressed markets, adding that few other European car manufacturers had managed to remain in profit through the recession. The Renault chairman said the group was seeking to forge new industrial partnerships following last year's collapse of its plans to merge with Volvo. But he played down the prospect of a far-reaching alliance. 'We need to develop limited co-operation agreements with competitors, like other players in the industry,' he said. Mr Schweitzer said talks were being held with Fiat of Italy, but denied a 'global' agreement was being discussed. The negotiations are thought to include the sharing of foundry facilities. Renault dismissed the idea of plans to exchange engines with Fiat or to seek an alliance between RVI, its trucks and buses division, with the Italian group's Iveco truck operation. Last year's profits were supported by financial income of FFr537m, compared with a charge of FFr43m in 1992, reflecting lower interest charges, and improved income from its financial subsidiaries. Reduced losses from its shareholding in Volvo, which has been partly unwound since the collapse of the merger, also helped earnings. Mr Schweitzer's prediction of an improved performance this year is based on signs of recovery in the European vehicle market and continued cost-cutting and efficiency measures. Renault said that the French market had been strongly boosted by government measures which include the payment of FFr5,000 to car-owners who trade in a vehicle more than 10 years old to buy a new one. According to Mr Schweitzer, the measures could bring about 200,000 extra orders in the French market. Turnover last year fell from FFr184.25bn to FFr169.79bn, after adjusting last year's figures for an accounting change which consolidated revenues from financial services. In unit terms, Renault sold 1.79m vehicles, a 12 per cent fall on 1992. In western Europe, sales of cars and light passenger vehicles fell 17 per cent to 1.39m, while market share slipped slightly from 11.3 per cent to 11.1 per cent. Renault is one of the 21 companies slated for privatisation. The sale of the government's controlling stake, however, which had been forecast to take place this year has been pushed back until 1995.   Companies:-  Renault.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

0,FT941-7670 ,"FT941-7670 _AN-EBXC7AAHFT 940224   FT  24 FEB 94 / Honda set to revise all Rover contracts      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   Honda intends to continue all its current projects with the Rover group, despite its decision to sever its equity link with the UK carmaker. But it has told BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker which is acquiring Rover from British Aerospace, that it wishes to renegotiate all the existing Honda/Rover contracts in the light of the change of ownership of the UK carmaker. The Japanese carmaker is expected to seek a significant increase in its licensing royalties and components prices as the price for it continuing the series of licensing agreements and components supply deals which underpin more than two-thirds of Rover's current car production. The renegotiation would involve the Rover 200, 400, 600 and 800 series, and threatens to reduce the profitability of the Rover business, which returned to an operating profit last year after two years of losses. Honda supplies around 8 per cent of Rover's total materials and components purchasing. It is understood that the assurance that the Japanese carmaker intended to continue all 'present and presently planned projects' was given by Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda president, when he met Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW management board chairman on Monday. Publicly Honda has said only that it intended to withdraw from its 20 per cent equity holding in the Rover vehicle operations. The assurance appears to calm fears that the BMW takeover of Rover - BMW is paying Pounds 800m and assuming Rover group net debt of Pounds 200m and off-balance sheet funding of Pounds 700m - could lead to significant disruption of production at Rover's UK plants. BMW believes that the Honda assurance also means that the Japanese carmaker will press ahead as planned with the so-called HH/Theta project to develop a new generation of cars to replace the current Rover 200/400/Honda Concerto sister cars. This project is already well advanced, and the Honda version of the new car is due to enter production in the autumn at the Japanese carmaker's plant at Swindon, Wiltshire. Rover will start production of its version of this family car shortly afterwards at its Longbridge, Birmingham, plant. Many components suppliers to Honda and Rover are at an advanced stage in preparing to supply parts for this new car range - the most important volume car in the Rover line-up - and any delay would have been disruptive to them. While Honda is expected to adopt a tough stance in the contract renegotiations, BMW will be able to use the lever that the Rover business is also a profitable part of the Japanese carmaker's operations. Rover is thought to contribute pre-tax profits of around Pounds 100m to Honda. BMW's purchase of Rover should be complete by mid-March. Lex, Page 26   Companies:-  Honda Motor.     Rover Group.

0,FT933-12086 ,"FT933-12086 _AN-DG0CFAGPFT 930726   FT  26 JUL 93 / VW jigsaw begins to clatter into place      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   SOME of the links necessary to support General Motors' charges that its former global purchasing chief and a group of his associates took industrial secrets with them when they departed for Volkswagen clattered into place last week. After revealing that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, now VW's production director, had a personal hand in the collection of some of the GM documents found in the former German home of two of his fellow defectors, public prosecutors made plain the next stage. 'The investigations will continue, with special attention to the examination of witnesses from the Volkswagen group,' they said last Thursday. The aim now is to try to seal the links, and extend the chain of evidence and circumstances. Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman and scion of the rich and influential Porsche family, has consistently denied all allegations of espionage, conspiracy or any other suspicions. Mr Gerhard Schroder, representing VW's biggest shareholder by virtue of his post as prime minister of Lower Saxony, which owns 20 per cent of the group, has repeatedly claimed it is all a commercial 'campaign'. He argues that GM, a 'foreign' company, is peeved at the loss of Mr Lopez, an inspired and inspiring manager, and is out for retribution. Mr Schroder, who met Mr Piech at a crisis meeting last Friday, is likely to keep his counsel in future. After last week's legal setbacks, and evidence of a popular swing of opinion in favour of GM's standpoint, VW needs a rather more professional approach to its public statements. According to a poll from the re-spected Forsa institute in Dortmund, 65 per cent of Germans believe there is 'something in' the US group's charges. This view has been encouraged by apparently ambivalent press statements from VW. There was no reason for Mr Lopez to resign 'at this point"", a spokesman said last week. The group's official response to the state prosecutors' revelations about the papers found in Wiesbaden also appeared to lack conviction. The tide of opinion and prima facie evidence appears to have turned against VW. The prosecutors are now believed to be working their way through interviews with VW employees. Starting with established members of staff, they are searching for evidence that GM data, whether on paper, computer disks or via electronic transmissions was filtered into VW's Wolfsburg headquarters. At the end of the list of interviewees stand the four former GM men, all of whom have already signed statements or affidavits that they neither took secrets from their old employer nor delivered them to their new one. They are on annual leave at present and not due back until early August, although all the signs at the weekend were that they were likely to be called back early.

0,FT934-2987 ,"FT934-2987 _AN-DLJDZAF3FT 931210   FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Volkswagen revises loss forecast      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   Volkswagen, the German carmaker, expects to lose DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.4bn) this year, some DM300m more than the company forecast two weeks ago. However, it aims to break even in 1994, according to Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman. The turning point at the German parent, Volkswagen AG, had already been reached, he said yesterday, predicting 1993 net earnings of between DM60m and DM80m - around 50 per cent lower than last time. Mr Piech attributed the 'improvement' at the parent, which was reported as losing DM768m after nine months, to the delayed arrival of dividend payments from successful subsidiaries. These included Autolatina in Brazil, which has benefited from a 37 per cent rise, to 440,000 cars, in Latin American deliveries, and the Shanghai plant, which contributed to a 46 per cent rise in Chinese sales of 132,000 units. The VW AG result, he suggested, would allow the company to pay an unchanged DM2 dividend. Group turnover for 1993 would fall 10 per cent to DM77bn, well short of the expected DM80bn on which Mr Piech based his summer predictions of a break-even result. Full-year sales at the parent were likely to be 19 per cent lower at DM43bn. Group deliveries would drop 12 per cent to 3.1m vehicles. These had been hit by a 21.6 per cent decline in western Europe, where VW said it retained market leadership despite a one percentage point fall in market share, to 16.5 per cent. Mr Piech based his predictions for the new year on assumptions of unchanged volumes and enhanced profitability and productivity. He claimed group costs had already been reduced by DM6bn this year. Cost-saving measures include the shedding of 23,000 jobs worldwide and reduced prices for bought-in components. Capital investment was also reduced in the past year by 40 per cent to about DM5bn. Medium-term plans allow for further cuts, including a standstill on building and extension work at the company's new factory at Mosel in eastern Germany. Further savings are expected from the closure of a Barcelona factory owned by VW's Seat subsidiary, which will remove some 9,000 more workers from the payroll, and the planned introduction of a so-called four-day week in six German factories. However, negotiations over the Spanish closure are currently deadlocked, and Mr Piech has demanded a solution before the end of next week. Although talks on shorter working hours in Germany are still continuing, it is becoming apparent that annual savings will be less than the DM1.8bn expected, and that the 28.8-hour working week is only a stop-gap measure. Mr Piech said yesterday a return to 35-hour working was 'hardly likely' after the expiry of the planned two-year agreement currently being discussed.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

0,FT931-5603 ,"FT931-5603 _AN-DCEB6ABMFT 930305   FT  05 MAR 93 / VW aims to double its market share      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   THE Volkswagen group, the largest European carmaker, is developing plans aimed at more than doubling the market share of the VW and Audi makes in the UK new car market by the late 1990s. Volkswagen acquired VAG United Kingdom, the distributor of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles in Britain, from Lonrho in December for Pounds 124m. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chairman of the Volkswagen group and chairman of the VW volume car division, outlined aggressive plans for the development of the two makes in the UK, which has been one of the German carmaker's weaker markets in Europe. He said that the VW brand would be aiming to gain a share of 7 per cent to 9 per cent by 1996/97, compared with a share last year of only 4.1 per cent. The Audi make would aim for 4 per cent to 5 per cent of UK new car sales compared with only 1.2 per cent in 1992. The German group's aggressive ambitions will cause unease among rival carmakers, whose profitability in the UK market has already been placed under heavy pressure during the protracted recession. VW faces a forecast drastic fall in sales in Germany, its most important market, in the next two years and the UK is one of the few markets expected to grow this year, albeit from a very low level. Competition is set to intensify in the UK market as the three Japanese carmakers, Nissan, Toyota and Honda, build up local production in Britain and VW's ambitions will pose a serious challenge to the established UK market leaders Ford, Vauxhall (General Motors) and Rover. Mr Goeudevert said: 'There is no reason why we should not reach in the UK the average level we have in the rest of Europe.' Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of west European new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent in the UK. 'VW missed the train in the past in not getting the share we did on the Continent,' said Mr Goeudevert. It is likely that the German carmaker will have to seek to increase significantly its penetration of the large fleet and company car sectors of the UK car market, which have already become the target of the Japanese car makers. Cars registered for company use account for more than half of all UK new car sales. Mr Goeudevert said that while VW sought to cut its cost base in Germany it had to continue to invest 'in the right direction'. VW working practices, Page 21   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

These natural materials are capable of assuming quite unusual  properties. In the ""supercritical"" state, for example, they can  replace solvents that are harmful to the environment and can  break down extremely stubborn ecological poisons. Even  chemically stable harmful substances can be broken down into  CO[.sub]2[/] and water.    When liquids or gases are heated beyond their respective  ""critical temperature"" and ""critical pressure,"" they undergo a  surprising metamorphosis. They lose their typical properties and  take on entirely different ones. The extraordinary solvent power  they possess in this supercritical state is extremely  interesting for the technology field. Dr. Helmut Schmieder of  the Institute for Hot Chemistry at the Nuclear Research Center  (KFZ) in Karlsruhe explained: ""Water becomes a universal solvent  for organic compounds under such conditions."" With respect to  their densities, the supercritical media scientists designate as  ""fluids,"" are similar to liquids, although their molecules move  as rapidly as gas particles. Fluids, therefore, surpass all  other liquids or gases in the rate of their solvent processes.    The best known such process introduced throughout the world  is the removal of caffeine by means of supercritical carbon  dioxide. Professor Helmut Tiltscher at Munich's Technical  University observes that ""problematical solvents like methylene  dichloride, benzene, and toluene, which had been used  previously, can now be replaced."" Carbon dioxide enjoys the  greatest advantage as a supercritical extracting agent by virtue  of the fact that it already achieves the solvent properties of a  fluid at a temperature of 31ëC and a pressure of 74 bar.    In recent years, these environment-friendly and time-saving  extractions have undergone rapid development in the United  States, especially in the food industry, where to a great extent  the use of halogenated hydrocarbons is forbidden. In this way,  the fat content of foods sold as dietary aids is reduced. These  processes are used to remove up to 80% of the cholesterol  from  powdered eggs and to derive aromatic substances from herbs. The  pharmaceutical industry is currently testing a supercritical  carbon dioxide extraction process to purify vitamin E. The  process could replace vacuum distillation, which has been  required to date, but which, with its temperature of 200ë,  entails the danger of thermal decomposition. Carbon dioxide is  nontoxic as a solvent, and it can be easily separated again from  the dissolved substances after the reaction by means of  ""relaxation.""    These supercritical processes are being increasingly used to  separate organic toxins or oils out of sewage and contaminated  solids. In laboratory tests researchers in the Nuclear Research  Center have now succeeded in almost completely separating the  grinding oil from the sludges, which build up during glass  processing, from the rubbed-off glass powder. ""In so doing,""  Schmieder concludes, ""nothing more prevents the grinding oil  from being reused."" Previously, almost DM1,000 per ton had to be  spent to dispose of the sludges in dumps. Similar experiments  are also underway in Karlsruhe to recover the same oils from  metal grinding sludges. About 150,000 tons of such sludges  accumulate yearly in Germany.    Reactions in supercritical water offer a new alternative for  the destruction of highly toxic waste materials. Water only  reaches the fluid state at a temperature of at least 374ëC  and a pressure of 221 bar. It not only becomes a good solvent  for organic harmful substances, but is also mixes thoroughly  with the air or oxygen. Under these conditions the substances  dissolved in the water oxidize, and are therefore destroyed, in  seconds. Several laboratories in Germany and the United States  are now studying ""supercritical oxidation"" as a means of  disposing of harmful substances.    The Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center has developed a pilot  plant operation at 500ëC and a pressure of 250 bar with an  hourly through-put of 10% watery media. The content of  harmful  substances must not exceed 10%. The system requires very  little  space. The 15-m-long Karlsruhe tube reactor only has an inner  diameter of 9 mm. With the words, ""unlike incineration, these  reactions take place in a closed container,"" Schmieder describes  a considerable advantage of the process, namely, in that no  harmful substances can escape.    While in the subcritical state in wet oxidation the harmful  substances are only partially decomposed, in the supercritical  process up to 98% of stubborn waste materials like  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), explosive materials, and  chemical agents decompose. The organic skeleton is completely  oxidized into carbon dioxide and water. No nitrogen oxides are  formed since the organically bound nitrogen is transformed  mostly into molecular nitrogen. Sulfur, phosphorus, and halogens  occur as acids or salts.    These anorganic salts are not soluble in the supercritical  water. They settle on the vascular walls and still constitute  processing difficulties. ""The greatest problem is the massive  corrosion attack which even nickel-based alloys find difficult  to resist,"" Professor Siegfried Leistikow, materials expert at  the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center, elaborated. The  supercritical media are extremely aggressive, although hope  exists for a solution through the use of linings made of noble  metals.    But, in so doing, the system becomes more expensive.  ""However, the costs even out since the reactors are so small,""  Tiltscher reckons. Tiltscher sees the best chance for the  process in special applications like byproducts from the  production of medicines, chemicals from the varnish and paint  industry, pesticides.    The efforts of the various laboratories and pilot operations  in the Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology (ICT) in  Pfinztal are concentrated on the decomposition of halogenated  hydrocarbons, nitro-and amino aromatics like plastics. Professor  Michael Modell of Framingham, Massachusetts, believes that  sewage sludges are an ideal object for supercritical water  oxidation. Having a solid material component of under  10%, they  are just right for this process. Modell is professor emeritus at  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at which the bases  for the elimination of harmful substances in supercritical water  were developed. He claims that in laboratory conditions he can  prevent the caking of salts and therefore prevent corrosion by  undertaking certain constructive measures. The first commercial  plants are scheduled for this year.    The attempt to clean heavily contaminated soil by means of  supercritical water is being tackled by Professor Gustav Brunner  in Hamburg-Harburg. The soil is placed in the system as a fixed  bed and then irrigated by the fluid. ""The supercritical water  has to handle a dual role in the process,"" Brunner explains.  First, it has to rid the soil of as many hydrocarbons as  possible, and, second, it has to oxidize the contaminants only  to the point that they become biologically degradable. However,  Brunner admits that the costs involved in this process of soil  cleansing are so great that it can only be used in exceptional  cases.     "
0,FT944-6483 ,"FT944-6483 _AN-EK2CXAGLFT 941129   FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ford returns to Samcor with 45% stake      By MARK SUZMAN and KEVIN DONE      JOHANNESBURG, LONDON   Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker, is re-entering the South African market through the purchase of a 45 per cent stake in South African Motor Corporation (Samcor). Ford divested its equity interest in Samcor in late 1987 as part of a series of withdrawals by US companies from South Africa in response to pressure from anti-apartheid groups. Samcor assembles Ford vehicles and some Mazda and Mitsubishi models. Ford will hold an equal stake with Anglo-American Industrial Corporation, buying 31 per cent of Samcor's equity from Amic and a further 14 per cent from the Samcor Employees Trust. This will leave AMIC and Ford both holding 45 per cent with the remaining 10 per cent staying in the hands of the trust. Mr Jim Miller, director of eastern Europe and export operations for Ford of Europe, is to become Samcor group managing director and chief executive. The deal, which has been expected for several months, in effect marks a return to the situation that existed prior to Ford's disinvestment from South Africa. Samcor was formed in 1985 as a joint venture between Ford South Africa, which had been founded by Ford Canada in 1933, and Anglo-American's existing automotive interests. Mr Wayne Booker, Ford executive vice-president of international automotive operations, said he hoped the US group's direct involvement would prove to be a spur to improved production and new export initiatives by Samcor. 'When I say Ford will re-establish its presence in South Africa, I mean it,' he said. 'This is not only an investment. Our action symbolises Ford's commitment to the South African market and the success of Samcor.' Mr Booker declined to disclose the financing of the transaction, saying only that it was a combination of new cash, new equipment and product investment. It was revealed, however, that the Employees Trust had received R50m (Dollars 14.1m) for the 14 per cent of Samcor equity it had sold to Ford. Samcor is currently in fourth place among South Africa's seven main vehicle makers. It has monthly sales of around 2,200 vehicles, trailing market leaders Toyota, Volkswagen and Nissan, but ahead of Mercedes-Benz, Delta (which manufactures Opel models) and BMW. South African producers currently manufacture about 320,000 units a year, of which passenger cars account for just over two-thirds. Almost all production is for the local market. The industry is under intense pressure, however, as South Africa begins to dismantle its high tariffs on imported motor vehicles, currently about 100 per cent, in line with Gatt requirements. Manufacturers, organised labour and the government are in negotiations to find an acceptable schedule for phasing out most of the industry's protection over the next eight years.

0,FT941-16713 ,"FT941-16713 _AN-EAIATABYFT 940108   FT  08 JAN 94 / The price is right: UK car sales are rising on the back of manufacturers' discounts      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   The UK has become a lonely, glittering prize for Europe's recession-battered motor industry. Carmakers in continental Europe, surveying the wastelands of their domestic markets, where sales fell last year by up to a quarter, are casting covetous eyes at the one big market in Europe enjoying what now looks like strong and sustainable growth. New car registrations in the UK increased by 11.6 per cent last year - far more than the industry dared to predict 12 months ago. Even pessimists in the industry now expect sales to climb throughout the year. But the explanation for the British revival is not a straightforward tale of rising demand and suppliers rushing to catch up. Much of the sales growth has been the result of consumers being wooed as never before by carmakers seeking either to stem losses or hang on to profitability and to keep production lines going. With few signs of market recovery on the Continent, consumers can expect the wooing to go on. The response of the consumer has caused some mayhem and not a little heartache among the big carmaking rivals. Where traditionally many motorists would stick with one manufacturer for a lifetime, they are now switching between makers according to which is offering the best deal. 'Today's customer has become mobile, choosy - and totally disloyal,' says Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers' Association. The break up of customer loyalties is apparent in the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' figures. Sales in relatively new market niches, particularly leisure four-wheel-drive vehicles such as Rover's Discovery and 'people carriers' like Renault's Espace, are still small but enjoying rapid growth. Most spectacularly, those manufacturers which have established reputations for diesel models are enjoying a field day: diesel car sales last year almost doubled to 340,000 and they now account for one in five of new cars sold. Mr Tom Purves, managing director of BMW (GB) says that the German executive carmaker had expected to sell 1,200 of its new diesel 3 and 5 series cars after their launch in the UK in the summer. 'We're past 1,800 and simply can't get enough.' In such niche markets sales have risen unaided but in the mainstream the battle is being fought increasingly on price, with the biggest gains and losses in terms of sales last year correlating closely to the size of the discounts being offered. Ford, once the market leader, is now struggling to maintain its pre-eminence, trailing behind both Vauxhall and Rover in December's sales figures. Last Spring, it cut the price of its new Mondeo saloon by an average of 6 per cent only a fortnight after launch. Subsequently sales revived. At the same time, sales figures for last year have dispelled any suggestion that, as Japanese makers Nissan, Toyota and Honda strengthened their manufacturing capacity in the UK, they would push aside all other competitors. The Japanese manufacturers are enjoying healthy growth - but having to invest as heavily in marketing as everyone else. Sales of Japanese models in the UK rose by more than 15 per cent last year. In common with other manufacturers, the Japanese companies are having to fight much more strongly than they expected against some of the Continental manufacturers who were expected to be among their early victims. A rash of well-received and competitively priced new models, combined with improved quality, successful marketing and generous offers on after-sales service, has led to companies such as Fiat, Peugeot and Citroen enjoying some of the best sales figures for any manufacturer last year. Sales of Fiats, for instance, which had been falling in the UK since the late 1980s, increased by 38 per cent last year. The company was helped in particular by the introduction of the tiny, Polish-built Cinqueconto, which set the pace for a new generation of urban runabouts and which virtually no other European maker can yet rival. The ferocity of the fighting for supremacy which waged throughout last year  -and which can only intensify in the absence of any significant Continental market upturn - has led some in the industry to question whether the recovery is as strong as it appears. In carefully-timed broadsides just before and during the London motor show in October, Mr Pulham, whose NFDA members sell four-fifths of all new cars, accused manufacturers of desperately trying to preserve market positions by 'forcing' the market. He said dealers were being pressurised into registering cars for which there were no final buyers in order to qualify for manufacturers' sales bonuses. By intensifying the downward pressure on prices, he argued, the practice was having an adverse effect on dealers, and because of the knock-on effects in the second-hand market, ultimately on the motorists as well. According to Mr Pulham, August alone saw at least 40,000 such cases. Such attacks on the tactics of carmakers may be prompted partly by dealers' self-interest. More than 2,000 dealerships have gone bust or changed hands in the past two years of recession, as sales margins have been squeezed. Meanwhile, the leading manufacturers are dismissive of the impact of their attempts to increase sales, saying 'pre-registering' has been part of the UK car market scene for years. In addition, industry analysts such as Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, estimate that the net effect of pre-registration is probably only a slight over-statement of the new car market's size. Year-on-year comparisons hold good and yesterday's statistics are a fair reflection of the trend, he believes. But another grievance of many dealers may prove of more significance: that the interests of individual consumers are being threatened by the practices of carmakers which sell direct to large fleet operators, bypassing the dealer networks. The NFDA says that such deals, which can involve discounts of 35 per cent or more, now account for more than 300,000 car sales a year - nearly 20 per cent of the total. As recently as the late 1980s, such deals were rare. The figures highlight the enduring popularity of the company car, many of which are now supplied from fleets, in spite of the progressive erosion in the past decade of their tax advantages. The latest changes to the company car tax regime, which come into effect on April 6, are expected to be broadly neutral. The NFDA maintains that the discounts offered to fleet buyers have to be paid for somehow - and that small company buyers and private motorists are subsidising them. New car list prices could be cut by 5 per cent if such deals were outlawed, says the NFDA. But the association is not optimistic that its call for such practices to be outlawed will be heeded. Such disputes over practices, however, cannot disguise a new found ebullience among both those who sell as well as make cars. This year, says Mr Ernie Thompson, the former Ford director recently appointed chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, sales should rise further by nearly 100,000, to 1.86m. 'To put that into perspective, it is still 20 per cent down on the 1989 peak,' he says. But for many dealers, the fact that the British recession is history will be enough.

0,FT943-5684 ,"FT943-5684 _AN-EICAFAEHFT 940902   FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Vickers ahead but shares fall on recovery warning      By ANDREW BOLGER   Shares in Vickers fell 7p to 188p yesterday after the engineering group, which makes tanks and Rolls-Royce cars, said it was seeing only a patchy recovery. Pre-tax profits nearly doubled, from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 15.9m, but were still slightly below market expectations. Sales were flat at Pounds 330m (Pounds 331m). Sir Richard Lloyd, chairman, said the recovery in results which started last year had continued, but this was more to do with plant rationalisation and efficiency measures than improvements in markets. Sales of Rolls-Royce cars rose slightly, from 683 to to 701, and higher sales in the UK and east Asia (excluding Japan) offset poor sales in North America. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said he hoped by the end of the year to reveal the outcome of talks the group has been having with other manufacturers over collaboration on new model programmes. Vickers will not say who it has been talking to, but is known to have been discussing the purchase of V12 engines and other components from Mercedes-Benz of Germany. Cosworth, the high-performance engine subsidiary, is still suffering from declining demand for special Ford Escorts and Scorpios, but is investing in a new factory for its castings business and an emission centre. The group's defence systems business now has a total order book of Pounds 1.5bn, following the government's recent confirmation of the follow-on order for 259 Challenger 2 tanks, in addition to the 127 tanks ordered in 1991. Sir Colin said the strength of this order book made the defence business a much stronger and more attractive partner when considering collaborative projects. The medical division's contribution fell, partly because of continued uncertainty over the proposed Clinton healthcare reforms and tough trading conditions for distributors in continental Europe. The propulsion technology division continued to suffer from the depressed state of the aerospace business, but on the marine side the Swedish-based KaMeWa company had an 'outstanding' six months. Earnings per share improved to 3.6p (1.9p). The interim dividend rose to 1.75p (1.25p). COMMENT The trading statement was deliberately downbeat, to lower expectations about the speed of likely recovery. But Vickers still looks in a strong position, following last year's Pounds 60m rights issue and the recent award of the crucial Challenger order. Capital investment is being increased - particularly at Cosworth - and there is some scope for margin improvement at the tank factories. On a prospective multiple of 19, the shares cannot be called cheap, but a modest upturn in demand for cars will sharply improve the bottom line. The shares are unlikely to move decisively until the group reveals its decision over collaboration on the next generation of luxury cars.   Companies:-  Vickers.

Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, advocated caution in the light of last year's 'surprises', when his spring forecast of a break-even result became a crash into a DM1.94bn loss. Results at Seat, the Spanish subsidiary whose near-collapse was blamed for the 1993 earnings slump, would be the deciding factor, he said. According to Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, group production director, the aim was for Seat to turn the corner in mid-1995. The VW brand was likely to improve its earnings. The Audi quality car division was budgeting to break even, as were the North American businesses. However, Mr Piech forecast heavy losses at Seat and deficits in Latin America. Skoda, the Czech subsidiary, would have a tough time to break even, he warned. Hinting at a brighter medium-term future, the chairman said the group had in one year carried through 20 per cent of the cost-cutting measures so far identified. The remaining potential for economies was 'the stuff of dreams'. Manufacturing costs in Germany had been reduced by DM1,000 a car, he claimed. Domestic factories had reached the point last year when they could break even working at 79 per cent of capacity, compared with 102 per cent in 1992. The level would fall to 74 per cent in the current year, and be reduced progressively to 65 per cent, Mr Piech said. Further job cuts this year - mostly outside Germany and concentrated in Spain and Latin America - would cut the global workforce by 25,000 to some 226,000. Group-wide productivity would be lifted by 25 per cent by the end of 1995, he said. Meanwhile, the introduction of the four-day week in six German factories making VW vehicles would reduce labour costs by DM1.6bm this year, according to Mr Peter Hartz, personnel director. Audi earlier this week announced a similar scheme involving a 10 per cent cut in working hours and pay. According to Mr Piech, VW was out-performing its competitors and the market, helped by price-cuts. European orders for VW models had risen 11.8 per cent in the first quarter, and German demand was up 54 per cent. Audi orders were down 14 per cent. Total group deliveries to customers were up 4.7 per cent at 838,000 vehicles. According to a breakdown of last year's results, published yesterday, the VW AG parent company earned a net DM71m - just enough to cover a DM2 dividend. Seat lost DM1.84bn, while the North American businesses lost more than DM460m. Skoda results, affected by new company legislation, showed a loss after tax of DM247m against net earnings of DM233m in 1992.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT931-12466 ,"FT931-12466 _AN-DA1B9AGHFT 930128   FT  28 JAN 93 / Leading Article: New Mercedes   AFTER TWO years of post-unity boom, the German motor industry is imbibing a high-octane dose of reality. Since the German economic downturn became evident last summer, the main German producers have been accelerating announcements of labour and output cuts. Volkswagen's new chairman estimates production costs exceed Japanese manufacturers' by 30 per cent. VW has yet to deliver a proper response. By contrast, Mercedes-Benz has unveiled a strategy to meet what may be the most wide-ranging challenges in the company's history. The motor subsidiary of Daimler-Benz is putting forward a plan with consequences and implications for the whole of German industry. It is broadening its product range, moving into the city car and 'multi-purpose vehicle' segments, pruning management, transferring assembly to Spain, South Korea and Mexico, and searching for international partners, especially in components. Mercedes' problems partly mirror those of German manufacturing in general. High labour charges, relatively short working hours and the rise in the D-Mark will lead to a deterioration in the company's costs of 15 to 20 per cent this year vis-a-vis several European countries. Competitive disadvantage is doubly hurtful during recession; German car sales may fall 15 per cent in 1993. Mercedes has to tackle weak points embedded in the company's culture. It is paying the price for failure to heed shifting international patterns of supply and demand. Japanese luxury car makers have undermined its presence in the US. Customers are turning away from status symbols in search of vehicles offering greater practicality and value for money. Preoccupation with quality is laudable, but the 'Mercedes-knows-best' mentality has sometimes insulated the company from the marketplace. Recognising this, Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes' chief executive-designate, has condemned the company's tendency to 'over-engineer' products. Following a line taken by Chrysler in the US, Mercedes wants to move to 'target pricing'. Its engineers will no longer be driven by dreams of creating the 'ultimate' car - but by what customers want to pay. Mercedes' step down from hauteur into a wider market is not risk-free. It must cut costs, but not technical excellence. It must shed staff when Germany's traditional consensus with labour has grown brittle. Daimler's motor operations must achieve a virtual corporate revolution at a time when the company's overall diversification strategy faces difficulties. Backed by its dominant shareholder, the Deutsche Bank, Daimler-Benz undoubtedly has the long-term financial muscle to see the changes through. If the plan succeeds, Mercedes could offer a blueprint of how Germany's top companies will look after the year 2000. Mercedes will be leaner, fitter, more flexible and customer-orientated. And its manufacturing will be a lot less concentrated in Germany.   Companies:-  Mercedes Benz.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.   Industries:-  P3711  Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

The Wilson Ford investigation is among several ongoing reviews of Orange County  car dealerships.    In January, the Orange County District Attorney's Office filed a civil lawsuit  against the Fairway dealership group, which has four showrooms in Fullerton and  Placentia. The suit alleges that Fairway salespeople failed to tell customers  in 29 separate instances when they were being sold cars that once had been in  rental car agency fleets. Those cases stemmed from a review of registrations  and sales by the DMV.    Last week, as part of that suit, a Superior Court judge ordered Fairway to  cease the practice and explicitly inform customers of the histories of cars  they buy. Investigators said then that at least four other dealerships were  suspected of the same offense, which is a violation of state consumer  protection laws.

This analysis showed that tilt table angle accounts for about 53 percent of the variability in rollover risk remaining after adjustment for differences in driver and road characteristics. The analysis showed that critical sliding velocity accounts for about 66 percent of the variability in rollover risk remaining after adjustments for driver and road characteristics. These compare to the 55 percent and 68 percent values found by logistic regression. These figures demonstrate that the two analytic methods are essentially in agreement regarding the statistical significance of stability metrics to the prediction of rollover.     The results of both the logistic and linear regression analyses performed by the agency suggest that a vehicle stability metric alone can account for approximately 50 percent of the variability in rollover risk in single vehicle accidents, for the population of make/models studied. While ideally it would be desirable to have these variables explain 100 percent of the remaining variability, such statistical correlations are almost never achieved. The agency views these analyses as demonstrating sound statistical and causal relationships between these variables and the likelihood of rollover. At the same time, the analyses show that other factors in addition to those analyzed are affecting rollover risk, as 35 percent to 25 percent of the variability in rollover risk is still unexplained after accounting for the driver, roadway, and tilt table angle or critical sliding velocity, respectively.     The above analyses used a Michigan accident data base combining passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles. As explained in section I, the rate of rollover fatalities and injuries per million registered vehicles is higher for sport utility vehicles and compact pickup trucks, but the absolute majority of harm occurs in passenger cars, because of their large numbers in use. In the current vehicle fleet, passenger cars generally have higher measured stability than light trucks. Thus, a safety standard requiring a minimum level of stability appropriate for all light duty vehicles would not be expected to affect many present or future small cars and therefore would not result in significant safety benefits. (For a further discussion of the problems associated with a minimum standard, see the section below entitled, ``Estimate of the Costs of a Standard.'')     Hence, the agency also examined the relative predictive capability of the stability metrics to rollover risk for passenger cars and light trucks separately, to investigate the possibility of setting a higher minimum level of stability for passenger cars. The results are shown in the table below, including a comparison to the results for all vehicles considered as a single group (see Table 1). As with the analysis of all vehicles considered as a single group, these analyses were limited to make/models for which both tilt table angle and critical sliding velocity were known.          "
0,FT934-4561 ,"FT934-4561 _AN-DLCDFABYFT 931203   FT  03 DEC 93 / 1.5p a mile M-way tolls could raise Pounds 700m      By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ROLAND RUDD   Tolls on Britain's motorways could raise a total of Pounds 700m a year if applied across the 2,000-mile network, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday. Present government thinking is that cars would be charged a maximum of 1.5p a mile and lorries 4.5p a mile so that a car journey from London to Birmingham would cost Pounds 1.50. This is a lower rate than charged on continental European motorways, and is intended to prevent drivers diverting to side roads. Ministers intend to push ahead with detailed studies of an electronic tolling system which could be introduced by 1998, he said. Vehicles would carry a smart card on their windscreen which would be read automatically from overhead gantries. It also became apparent yesterday that bus companies face pressure to raise fares. When Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, put 3p a litre on petrol in his Budget he also announced that the bus fuel duty rebate, which usually compensates for such increases, would not be raised. London Buses estimates this will add Pounds 3m a year to its costs. However National Express, Britain's largest operator of scheduled coach services, said it planned to absorb the higher costs without increasing fares. Yesterday in a Commons written answer, Mr MacGregor promised that motorway toll charges would be devoted solely to the construction and operation of the motorway network. The Treasury had no objection to reserving such funds for a particular purpose because they were not taxes, he said. He also assured MPs that the government would take the level of charges into account when setting motoring taxes. Electronic tolling is being introduced in many other countries but systems are not yet sophisticated enough for Britain's heavily used motorway network. The transport department is to invite manufacturers to submit details of their technologies in fields such as smart cards. It will then set up a trial system within the next year. Organisations representing road users gave a lukewarm response to the government announcement. The AA and the RAC, motoring organisations, said they accepted the proposal reluctantly and only if the Treasury did not cut the roads budget to compensate for tolls. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said it was like adding a 2 per cent to 3 per cent value added tax by the back door. 'This is a deplorable move which will drive yet more people off public transport,' he said. National Express said it did not think motorway tolls would have a significant effect on its costs but that they might persuade more motorists to switch to coach travel. It called for a special toll rate for public transport vehicles.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4785 Inspection and Fixed Facilities.

0,FT932-15190 ,"FT932-15190 _AN-DDOCIAAZFT 930415   FT  15 APR 93 / Sharp fall in Euro car sales      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   NEW car sales in west Europe fell by 9.4 per cent last month as demand dropped steeply for the third month in succession. In the first quarter, new car sales declined by 17.3 per cent to around 3.06m. Sales in March declined to 1.18m from 1.3m in the equivalent month a year earlier, according to industry estimates. Demand in March was lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe, with higher sales registered only in the UK and Greece. The rate of decline moderated in March, following steep falls of 23 and 17 per cent in January and February, but leading carmakers are being forced to lower further their already pessimistic sales forecasts for the full year. General Motors, the US maker, said yesterday it now expected new car sales in west Europe to fall by 11 per cent to only 11.95m this year from 13.45m in 1992 compared with a 1993 forecast of 12.3m. In Germany, the single biggest market in west Europe, sales fell by 14.9 per cent in March to an estimated 363,000. Sales plunged by 21.7 per cent in the first quarter. Most leading carmakers in Europe have been forced to implement short-time work and are cutting workforces in the face of shrinking profits or mounting losses. The rate of decline has accelerated in Italy, where new car registrations fell by 20.8 per cent in March to 190,000. New car sales in France in March were 9 per cent lower than a year ago, while demand in Spain dropped steeply by 22.7 per cent. The only significant relief is being shown in the UK, where sales in March were 12.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Sales in the first quarter rose by 11.6 per cent. After plunging by a third during more than three years of recession, sales in the UK have been higher than a year ago in each of the last six months.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS January-March 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Volume     Volume    Share (%)   Share (%)                               (Units)   Change(%) Jan-Mar 93  Jan-Mar 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET                3,064,000     -17.3     100.0       100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen* (incl.            515,000     -17.9      16.8        17.0 Audi, SEAT  Skoda) General Motors                382,000     -18.2      12.5        12.6 (Opel/Vauxhall, US****  Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall               367,000     -18.1      12.0        12.1  -Saab**                       10,000     -24.5       0.3         0.4 Fiat (incl.

0,FT931-12132 ,"FT931-12132 _AN-DA3AKADVFT 930129   FT  29 JAN 93 / World Trade News: GM shifts production from Finland      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   GENERAL Motors Europe has transferred all production of its Opel/Vauxhall cars in Finland to Germany, triggering a complex legal battle with its Finnish partner Valmet, the majority state-owned paper machinery and engineering group. GM has moved production of its Opel/Vauxhall Calibra coupe from Valmet's plant at Uusikaupunki to one of its main German plants at Russelsheim, near Frankfurt. The US carmaker, which is in second place in the west European new car market, has been forced to introduce short-time working at the Russelsheim plant during the first three months of this year in the face of weakening new car sales in west Europe. It has moved the Finnish assembly to Germany to improve capacity utilisation at the German plant and to avoid the added cost penalties of production in Finland. Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, said the company incurred a cost penalty of around FM5,000 (Pounds 600) per car for Calibras produced in Finland compared with assembly of the same car in Germany. GM had shipped many of the components to Finland from its plants in Germany, incurring substantial transport costs. In a separate move to cut production costs in Europe, GM is also planning to reduce output at its Bochum plant in Germany, by moving from three-shift to two-shift working. The company has already introduced short-time working at its Antwerp, Belgium and Luton, UK assembly plants. The GM action in Finland is a significant blow to the loss-making Valmet group, which produced 34,556 Opel/Vauxhall cars in 1992 and 21,532 in 1991, but which now faces the complete loss of the Opel business in 1993. Valmet is left only with the assembly of the Saab 900 convertible of which it will produce 7,000-8,000 this year compared with 10,800 in 1992. Saab Automobile is owned equally by GM and Saab-Scania of Sweden. Valmet is seeking to resolve the dispute with GM under Finnish arbitration rules, but GM is challenging the legality of this move. It is expected to move soon to invoke arbitration under the rules of the UN Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), as stipulated in the 1990 Calibra assembly agreement. Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, signed an agreement with Saab-Valmet, now a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of Valmet, in June 1990 for the assembly of the Calibra in Finland at a time when GM needed extra capacity in west Europe with new car demand at a record level. The assembly agreement with Valmet is not due to expire until the end of 1996. Under the terms of the deal, GM believes that it is free to decide the volume of cars to be assembled in Finland each year. This volume can be set at zero, as there are no volume guarantees, but only a contractually agreed price per unit.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Valmet.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT931-10491 ,"FT931-10491 _AN-DBICOAAEFT 930209   FT  09 FEB 93 / VW to cut 36,000 jobs worldwide in five-year programme      By DAVID WALLER      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's leading carmaker, said yesterday that it plans to cut its worldwide workforce by 36,000 by the end of 1997, reducing the current figure of 276,000 by 13 per cent. The cuts are a response to sharply deteriorating markets in Germany and Europe as a whole. In broad terms, the cuts had been expected for some time, although their scale is larger than expected. Previous estimates centred on a loss of 30,000 jobs. VW is believed to have been planning the cuts since the beginning of the year when Mr Ferdinand Piech, previously head of its Audi luxury cars division, took over as the group's chief executive. It is thought the group has made an operating loss of DM1bn (Pounds 420m) in its core VW division last year and its efficiency, measured in terms of sales per employee, is poor compared with other carmakers. The plan is believed to have been drawn up as part of a five-year strategy agreed by the group's supervisory board early last month, but details have never formally been released. VW hopes to achieve the cuts without compulsory redundancies by means of early retirement schemes and natural wastage. The company insisted yesterday that the figure represented only a 'guideline, not a target', drawn up on the assumption that the German car market would shrink by 20 per cent during the current year and the European market by 10 per cent. If conditions turned out better than expected, the figure would be revised, VW said. It did not indicate how much money the group planned to save. Of the total, 21,000 jobs will be shed in Germany and 15,000 elsewhere. Around 5,000 will go at Seat, the group's Spanish subsidiary. Its Audi and Skoda divisions will lose 8,000 jobs between them, although the majority will fall at Audi rather than at Skoda, the group's Czech subsidiary. The overseas division includes operations in the US, Mexico, Canada, South Africa and Japan. It is also responsible for VW's 51 per cent stake in Autolatina, the Argentine and Brazilian operations. The German motor industry faces major restructuring; Mr Louis R. Hughes, a former head of Opel, the General Motors subsidiary, has recently predicted the industry workforce would be cut by half in the next few years. The car industry has been one of the hardest hit of all sectors of the German economy during the current downturn. Companies are suffering a sharp fall in sales after two record years following German reunification, their problems exacerbated by the appreciation of the D-Mark in recent months. There is also increased competition from Japanese carmakers within Europe. With the exception of VW, almost all manufacturers announced their first job cuts a year ago.

0,FT933-10888 ,"FT933-10888 _AN-DHBCDAAVFT 930802   FT  02 AUG 93 / Car groups' spying dispute set to enter decisive stage      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   THE investigation of General Motors' spying allegations made against senior Volkswagen employees will enter a decisive stage this week with the expected return to Germany of key witnesses. Public prosecutors will be able to step up their questioning and are expected soon to call Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's former global purchasing director, and three associates who GM says systematically plundered industrial secrets from the US group and its European subsidiaries before defecting to VW in March. The four former GM employees and most of their VW colleagues have been away during the traditional works holiday period. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the German concern's chairman, will also press his initiative for background talks with Mr Jack Smith, president of GM, without prejudice to the legal case, VW said. Mr Piech, who made contact last week in what was seen as a damage limitation exercise, will telephone Mr Smith again today or tomorrow, VW said. The VW chairman's public attack on GM last week, hinting at a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, was widely criticised as ill judged. It sparked appeals for 'moderate language' from government ministers concerned at the damage being done to Germany's reputation. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, federal economics minister, offered to act as a mediator between the two sides after Mr Piech's accusations of mud-slinging and his declaration that the case was a war in which the US concern wanted to destroy his company. Meanwhile, Mr Lopez denied in a statement further claims in the weekly magazine Der Spiegel that 'secret' documents from a meeting in Germany on March 10, the day after he signed a contract to work with immediate effect for VW, were shipped at his request to his home in Uribe, northern Spain. This conflicts in part with allegations last week from Adam Opel, the US group's German subsidiary, that local staff, unaware of his new job, fulfilled his requests for 'internal' Opel data which were presented at the meeting to be sent to Spain. According to Der Spiegel, Mr Lopez had earlier asked for nine cartons to be sent to the Uribe address. The boxes, weighing 150kg, were reportedly sent on February 22. In his statement at the weekend, issued on his behalf through VW, Mr Lopez said he had asked 'at an earlier' point for books, magazines and personal documents from his Opel office to be sent to Uribe. According to evidence presented to prosecutors last week but released by VW at the weekend, a VW director claimed Mr Lopez was subjected to emotional pressure from Mr Smith to try to keep him at the US group in March. Mr Smith allegedly pleaded with him to stay, warning that GM would go bankrupt if he left, and that Mr Smith would be sacked.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Volkswagen.     Adam Opel.

0,FT933-6272 ,"FT933-6272 _AN-DH2AOACIFT 930828   FT  28 AUG 93 / Investigators defend raid on Volkswagen offices: State prosecutors shrug off charges of leak to media      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   INVESTIGATORS who raided Volkswagen, the German carmaker, on Thursday in search of allegedly stolen data, yesterday appeared confident they had found material of help to them. 'The object of the search was at no time endangered,' even though the suspects might have known details of the swoop, said Mr Georg Nauth, spokesman for the Darmstadt state prosecutors' office. Investigators, backed up by 40 police, went in looking for papers and computer-stored data in connection with their investigations into allegations that material was stolen from VW's rival, Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, by former employees of the US group who defected to VW in March. According to Mr Nauth, the search was completed yesterday morning after officials had confiscated large volumes of documents and computer diskettes, along with around 30 stand-alone personal and laptop computers: 'In the light of their complexity, evaluation of these materials will demand a lot of time,' he said. Mr Nauth seemed unruffled by charges that information on the raid had been leaked. Three TV camera crews were waiting outside the VW main plant in Wolfsburg when the police arrived on Thursday morning. The usual VW press relations team, meanwhile, had been reinforced by employees from other divisions and subsidiaries. One spokesman said yesterday tips about the raid could be seen in the media; another was 'astonished' to see the camera crews at the factory gates. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the group production director at the centre of the criminal investigation, carried on working unperturbed when investigators barged into his office. His house and those of three of his associates were being searched at the same time. 'The Darmstadt public prosecutors' office seems to have as many holes as a Swiss Cheese,' said Mr Uwe-Karsten Heye, spokesman for the government of Lower Saxony, VW's home state. However, the Lower Saxony government itself had been informed in advance of the action, led by officials from Hesse, who requested assistance from local police forces. In a bizarre twist, two men from the Frankfurt red-light district also appeared to have known about the impending raid. They were arrested on Tuesday night after telephoning VW with an offer to sell the company information for DM500,000. The company informed the police of 'attempted extortion' without discovering details of the information, a spokesman said. According to press reports, the two men had learnt about the raid from police officers they met at a Hesse shooting club. Mr Hans Wilhelm Gab, vice-president of GM Europe and a member of the Opel supervisory board, said the affair was a matter of 'questionnable behaviour' by individuals.

0,FT933-2369 ,"FT933-2369 _AN-DISAKAE1FT 930918   FT  18 SEP 93 / Motoring: Promising concepts for your family - Frankfurt Show / Stuart Marshall has been looking at exciting cars of the future      By STUART MARSHALL   IMAGINE a car that at four metres (13ft 4in) long is shorter than a Toyota Corolla hatchback but has more rear seat room than a Toyota Lexus LS400 luxury saloon. The floor, front and back, is completely flat. Its 1.8 litre lean-burn engine drives the front wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. If you think it sounds like a very sensible family car for the mid-1990s, I can only agree. But there is more. Accelerator, foot and parking brakes are electronically operated, like the 'fly-by-wire' controls in the latest aircraft, though with fail-safe mechanical back-up. The driver sits high. To make parking in tight places easier, only the first 30 cm (12 in) of the bonnet are out of sight. The digital speedometer is a 'head up' display - you see the speed reflected in the windscreen without having to lower your eyes from the road. A single enormous motor-driven door on each side moves slightly out and then back at a finger touch, with the rear view mirrors folding automatically. Even if you have to park very closely to the car alongside, getting out will not be a struggle. This paragon of commonsense is called the Toyota Raum. I rated it the most practical and promising of all the concept cars at Frankfurt Show. Although Raum is clearly a concept car, it could be produced now, using existing factory facilities. But will it? Toyota says it is not a technological tour de force, just good old-fashioned innovation, and is a good indication of what might find it way into Toyota dealerships in the not-too-distant future. Among other eye-catching concept cars at Frankfurt were the Buick Sceptre, a rear wheel driven, supercharged 3-litre V6 engined four-door with active suspension and styling that might grow on one, and the Mitsubishi HSR-IV and ESR. The HSR-VI has a 1.6-litre V6 but one complete bank of cylinders is shut off at low speeds, reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. All four wheels drive and steer. ESR (for ecology, science and research) is a futuristic hybrid vehicle, driven by nickel-hydrogen batteries recharged by a 1.5-litre petrol engine. It looks like a Star Wars prop, seats four, is fitted with six air bags for all-round passenger protection, has a top speed of 124 mph (200 kph) and a range of up to 625 miles (1,000 km). I never dismiss concepts like ESR as flights of high-tech fancy. My grandchildren may be driving them in 20 years time.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

They did not see, or hear the seven vehicles - two Volkswagen mini-vans and five Opel saloons - which just before 10am snaked along the wide, tree-lined entrance to VW's 13-storey administrative block. 'Sure, we knew about all the rumours. But they raided the place today? Wow, that's a big surprise] Well, well,' exclaimed Mario, a 24-year-old VW technician. Mario's parents came to Germany from Italy as immigrant workers in the late 1950s. In the Tunnel Schanke pub, the men smoking and drinking in the long, narrow building close to the factory gates, barely believed it. 'You're joking. You mean to tell us that the police are on the 13th floor (where directors' offices and VW lawyers are based). Here at VW,' asked Mr Martin Liesner, an engineer at VW for 20 years. 'But what do they want?' Everyone in Wolfsburg either works for VW or knows someone who works there. In fact more than 54,000 of the town's 130,000 population works there. 'Wolfsburg is Volkswagen,' local officials say. With local unemployment at around 8 per cent, the town's workers want the affair over quickly. 'Lopez is our hope,' said Mr Liesner: 'He can make Volkswagen competitive, he can give us security.' Mr Lutz Schilling, VW's director of communications, explained: 'It is not only affecting the 13th floor. They are also checking out the marketing and management institute (a building close to VW's private houses) and some guesthouses,' all in and around Wolfsburg. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's office is on the 13th floor. 'From there, Mr Lopez has a view, and a vision,' said Mr Schilling, adding that Mr Lopez was 'working all day' yesterday. 'Actually, this raid is not a surprise,' he added, with commendable sang froid. 'We were expecting it to take place sooner. At least it will clear the air. We will help the investigators in any way. This will end the speculation.' But he conceded: 'This is not a fine day for anybody.' 'You ask me what is behind all this?' Mr Schilling said. 'Well, the fact that Lopez left the number one car manufacturer in the world . . . it was a shock for them.' He added: 'We are happy to have Lopez. He is the best manager in the field, the state prosecutors will give a complete picture at last.' As he spoke workers streamed in and out of the factory as usual, impervious to the drama taking place inside. 'This is just another normal day,' said Mahmut, who came from Tunisia 20 years ago to work for VW.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT943-9216 ,"FT943-9216 _AN-EHLDRADAFT 940812   FT  12 AUG 94 / Rapid gear change to stay in the race: European carmakers are recovering from recession, but are they sufficiently competitive      By KEVIN DONE   The grinding of gears has been harsh, but gradually Europe's automakers are climbing out of the worst recession of the postwar period. Four of the big six volume carmakers in Europe crashed into heavy losses last year, as new car sales fell by more than 15 per cent to 11.4m, the lowest level since 1985. While the leading European car producers are still struggling to stem the flow of red ink with drastic restructuring measures, their share prices have, however, been rising sharply for the past 18 months. In the first half of this year new car sales have also begun to flicker back to life. The automotive sector was the worst-performing area in European stock markets over the past seven years, according to James Capel, the stockbroker. This year it has been the strongest, and had outperformed Capel's European JC index by 20 per cent by early August. Fiat, which incurred the biggest loss in its 95-year history last year and is paying no dividend on its ordinary shares for the first time since 1947, has outperformed the Milan market by 38 per cent in 1994. PSA Peugeot Citroen with its first loss last year since 1984, has outperformed the Paris bourse by 20 per cent, while Volkswagen, which had a group loss of DM1.94bn last year, has outperformed the Frankfurt market by 22 per cent. Though share prices started to rise early last year, new car and commercial vehicle sales were still plunging precipitously. But some foundation for such early optimism is finally beginning to appear. New vehicle sales started to pick up during the first half of this year, arousing renewed confidence among vehicle makers and their suppliers that recovery is under way. 'We now expect that 1994 will turn out to be a much better year than we thought likely at the end of 1993,' said Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, one of the leading UK automotive components suppliers. In the first six months, new car sales in west Europe have risen by 6.8 per cent to 6.5m. The upturn has been led by the UK, France, Spain and Scandinavia. 'Western European markets have evidently passed through the nadir of demand, with many markets now recording quite high rates of expansion,' said Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the management board of BMW of Germany. With its heavy fixed costs, the auto industry is sensitive to changes in sales volumes. As demand picks up, allowing plants to be run at higher production volumes, profits should respond accordingly. 'Assisted by a major shedding of labour, savings in purchasing costs and the start of a recovery in sales, profits now look set for a strong recovery, and we are predicting that earnings will reach new highs in 1996,' said Mr Bob Barber, automotive expert at James Capel. The turnround is not without pain, however. Recession forced plants to close in the face of severe overcapacity and tens of thousands of jobs have been eliminated. Ford of Europe has reduced its workforce (excluding Jaguar) by 15 per cent, with the loss of 15,100 jobs since late 1992. Mercedes-Benz, the car and commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest engineering group, cut 14,700 jobs from its domestic workforce in 1992, a further 11,000 last year, and it is planning to cut another 8,000 jobs to bring its workforce to 151,000 by the end of 1994. Volkswagen reduced the workforce at its six domestic plants (excluding Audi) in the past three years by 27,000 to about 102,000 by spring. Higher productivity and reduced sales volumes mean that it still has about 30,000 surplus employees. For 1994 and 1995, it is operating a pioneering pact with German trade unions, allowing a big cut in pay and working hours (to a 28.8-hour week) to stave off even more radical job losses. Most carmakers believe that they have turned the corner after last year's losses, the scale of which took the industry by surprise. 'No source had predicted the scale of the disaster until well into the year,' said Mr Gianni Agnelli, Fiat chairman, recently. After last year's record loss of L1,783bn (Pounds 730m), Mr Agnelli says the company's full-year result should 'be better than break-even'. Past responses to recession have not been enough this time round, however, and carmakers have had to revamp their strategies. The European motor industry is undergoing a hectic transition, as the European Union moves to become an open car market with the removal of all quota restrictions on car and light commercial vehicle imports from Japan at the end of 1999. European carmakers are also in a race to become globally competitive. Their rivals in North America - in particular Chrysler and Ford, with GM bringing up the rear - have already made huge progress in closing the competitive gap on the Japanese producers. The share taken by Japanese carmakers in west Europe may be down this year as they have been battered by the strength of the yen, but it is likely to be only a temporary respite. Japanese penetration is still forecast to rise to about 15 per cent by the end of the decade. Incursions into the European market are also growing from North America, both from the big three US carmakers and from Japanese assembly plants in the US. European carmakers are fighting back with radical changes of strategy. For instance, Mercedes-Benz is transforming its new product strategy. Having accepted the unpalatable truth that its luxury cars were 'over-engineered' and that it could end up being 'priced out' of world markets, it is planning to launch vehicles into several new segments of the world market by the late 1990s, including a small family car sized between a Volkswagen Golf and a Ford Fiesta, and most surprisingly a micro compact car for urban commuting that it is developing in a joint venture with SMH, the Swiss maker of Swatch watches. Restructuring is taking on new forms, as carmakers dispose of in-house components operations to outside suppliers to allow themselves to concentrate on the core operations of the design, development and assembly of vehicles. In its boldest move in this direction Fiat is transferring a components operation with more than 700 employees to GKN, which is to invest Pounds 50m in a new plant in Italy. Belatedly, European makers are also closing yawning gaps in their product armouries. Volkswagen, Ford of Europe, Fiat and Peugeot are all launching their first MPVs (multi-purpose vehicles like the Renault Espace) into a fast-growing sector of the world market until now dominated by Japanese and US producers. Such responses may not be enough. Standard  Poor's, the US credit rating agency, warns in a recent report that 'European auto industry fundamentals are becoming increasingly difficult for the volume automakers'. It says that Europe's car market is becoming 'more subject to volatile cyclical fluctuations' as European economies converge. It forecasts that long-term growth in new car demand will slow, with the main markets 'approaching saturation'. The European industry will 'remain beset by significant excess production capacity', while intensifying competition for market share has led to rapidly rising marketing costs and aggressive discounting. European automakers' 'relatively limited' presence in other regions of the world leaves them highly vulnerable to competitive conditions in western Europe. It is a catalogue of shortcomings that may temper investors' optimism, which has sent automakers' share prices soaring in recent months.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT924-6113 ,"FT924-6113 _AN-CKWCKAD2FT 921123   FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (10): Obstacles to progress - EC deregulation plans      By PHILLIP HASTINGS   AMBITIOUS plans to totally deregulate European Community road haulage operations have had a bumpy ride over the past couple of years. But while full deregulation will not be achieved in time for the formal creation of the EC Single Market at the end of this year, there are signs that the remaining obstacles to further progress are slowly being dismantled. 'We do not yet have cabotage in the EC and they still have not solved the problems of vehicle taxation. Nevertheless, when you consider what has been done in the last few years after years and years of stagnation, a great deal of progress has been made,' says Mr Reg Dawson, a leading EC transport consultant. Still far from clear is the effect that the likely eventual liberalisation of EC road haulage activities will have on future demand for commercial vehicles. On the one hand, deregulation is expected to result in considerable rationalisation of the European road haulage industry, suggesting fewer customers for commercial vehicle manufacturers. Conversely, though, survivors of the anticipated shake-out will need more vehicles to support their expanding operations. Crucial to the full deregulation of EC road haulage activities is the issue of cabotage - the right of hauliers from one EC country to freely operate inside another state. Vehicles engaged in cabotage work are subject to many of the regulations of the state where the work is carried out. But that situation is itself causing complications. For example, while the host country's laws apply to issues such as pricing, contracts, vehicle weights and dimensions, work and rest hours, other matters including social security, vehicle registration and taxation come under the jurisdiction of the operator's home country. The establishment of EC cabotage made little progress until mid-1990 when the European Council of Ministers finally agreed to its introduction in a very limited form. Basically, that system makes available a quota of cabotage authorisations - just under 17,000 for 1992 - distributed among the member states. Supporters of full deregulation of the European road haulage industry had hoped that initial moves on cabotage would lead to its full introduction in 1993. But vested national interests have slowed down such development. Some EC countries, notably Germany and France, fear their domestic haulage industries could be badly damaged by a sudden influx of competition from outside countries such as Spain and Greece where operating costs are lower. For that reason, Germany in particular has insisted on linking the issue of cabotage with moves to harmonise hauliers' costs, for example through vehicle and fuel taxes, throughout the Community. Germany also wants to see the establishment of a common system for tolls and road-user charges for heavier commercial vehicles. The German authorities appear to be winning the argument over the need to harmonise haulage industry costs within the EC. The European Commission has within the last couple of months put forward a proposal which, if accepted, could mean that hauliers have to pay a road tax for using the Community's motorways from January 1994. The Commission claims such a tax, which would be based on the size of vehicle and the time spent on the road, would allow member states to recoup some of the costs of building and maintaining road infrastructures. The most recent meeting of EC transport ministers in October made some further progress on harmonising road taxes. However, the Commission's published proposals do not suggest any minimum or maximum charges. Instead, individual member states would set their own tax levels. That absence of a standard tax figure, it is feared, could lead to continuing disputes between countries such as Germany, which want to set higher charges, and poorer member states who fear that implementing such taxes would badly damage their industries. Meanwhile, pressure is growing on EC ministers to reach agreement on the subject of cabotage. Specifically, time is running out on a controversial European Court ruling that if the ministers fail to agree a timetable for full cabotage by the end of this year, there must be complete cabotage freedom from 1993. Detailed proposals on the subject are expected to be ready for discussion at the next European Council meeting in early December. Having had a deregulated road haulage industry for some 20 years, the UK is one of the countries most in favour of deregulating and harmonising operations throughout the EC. However, the UK remains out of step with the rest of the Community on the subject of vehicle weights. While other EC countries allow trucks of 40 or even 44 tonnes on their roads, the UK has a limit of 38 tonnes and a derogation to continue with that limit until 1999.

0,FT942-9355 ,"FT942-9355 _AN-EEQDYAAGFT 940517   FT  17 MAY 94 / EDS and Sprint talks may lead to 'merger of equals'      By MARTIN DICKSON      NEW YORK   General Motors said yesterday it was considering spinning off its Electronic Data Systems subsidiary to pave the way for a possible merger or strategic alliance between EDS and Sprint, the US telecommunications group. EDS and Sprint simultaneously confirmed that they were in talks which could lead to a 'merger of equals' or other type of alliance. A marriage between EDS, the world's largest computing services company, and Sprint, the third largest long-distance US carrier, would create an information services powerhouse, with annual revenues of more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.3bn). GM said EDS would best be able to pursue a strategic alliance if it were an independent company. EDS has held discussions with numerous potential telecommunications partners in recent years - including British Telecom - but has found it hard to clinch an alliance because of its unusual ownership structure. GM, which acquired the company in 1984 from its founder, Mr Ross Perot, retains ownership of its assets, but holders of a special type of GM stock, known as class E, have a claim on EDS's dividend stream. GM said yesterday it was considering spinning off ownership of EDS to class E stockholders through an exchange of shares, provided this transaction was tax-free. GM bought EDS for Dollars 2.5bn, but the company now has a market value of about Dollars 15bn, so sale of the group could trigger a large tax liability. It will be up to the US Internal Revenue service to decide whether the spin-off is for legitimate business purposes rather than tax avoidance. GM said the spin-off would be dependent on two other factors. It must be able to conclude a plan, announced last week, to inject the remaining Dollars 6bn of class E stock held by its treasury into its underfunded pension plan; and the spin-off must not result in a recapitalisation of E shares into GM common stock at a 120 per cent exchange ratio, as provided for under the group's certificate of incorporation. EDS and Sprint emphasised that many issues remained to be resolved in their merger discussions. But Mr Les Alberthal, chairman of EDS, and Mr William Esrey, chairman of Sprint, said the two companies had the opportunity to 'create a single source for products and services to meet the converging information and communications needs of customers'. EDS's strength in the large business market would help Sprint expand here, while Sprint's presence in the consumer market would allow EDS to develop products for the individual. Shares in Sprint jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to close the day at Dollars 37 3/4 while E class stock was up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 34 1/2 . GM slipped from Dollars 53 1/2 to Dollars 53.

0,FT944-7013 ,"FT944-7013 _AN-EK0AOADGFT 941126   FT  26 NOV 94 / International Company News: VW plan to cut investment prompts slip in share price      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   The Volkswagen share price suffered yesterday as the company announced plans to slash capital investment and reports circulated of internal profit forecasts which fell far short of analysts' expectations. After trading up during the day, the automotive group's shares shed more than DM6 towards the close, ending DM3.70 down at DM451.80. The company last night refused to confirm or comment on the existence of a document reportedly presented at a meeting of the supervisory board yesterday which showed the management expected pre-tax profits in 1995 of DM890m (Dollars 571.17m). The document was also reported to say the outcome could be up to DM200m higher or lower, and added that sales would rise only modestly next year and it would be difficult to increase prices. According to the Reuters news agency which said it had copies of the paper, the management forecasts were far more gloomy than those of stock market expectations, which were mostly based on earnings well above DM1bn. The agency quoted one analyst describing such a result as 'depressing', although others found it hard to believe the figures were correct, suggesting the management could have massaged the data to present as poor a picture as possible to the supervisory board. Under German accounting rules, companies commonly add to or draw down hidden reserves at any time without publicising such moves. While investors are convinced that VW is set to rebound strongly from its net DM1.94bn losses last year, management may want to play down the extent of the recovery while it is still trying to cuts costs and increase productivity. Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, recently angered his competitors with a down-beat assessment of the car market's prospects which hit all automotive groups' shares. VW may also want to paint as black a picture as possible to enhance its chances of success with its current lobbying exercise in Bonn for government subsidies. The company wants funds for a 'scrapping premium' scheme similar to those used earlier to liven up the Spanish and French car markets. Ordinary car owners were paid substantial sums to trade in cars over 10 years old for new models. VW says more than 20 per cent of the German car market would stand to gain most, while other groups such as Mercedes and BMW are believed to be strongly against subsidies which would appeal mainly to owners of lower-priced cars. The non-executive supervisory board, which is dominated by worker representatives and Social Democrat politicians, yesterday approved a sharp cut in medium-term investment plans, which reduces the five-year budget for 1995 to 1999 to DM58.5bn compared with DM69bn for the current budget to the end of 1998. The total will be divided virtually equally between the factories and the group's financial services business.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT933-11224 ,"FT933-11224 _AN-DG3CDAD5FT 930730   FT  30 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Destruction Derby   IN THE past week, the battle between General Motors and Volkswagen has escalated into a commercial war of a bitterness without parallel in recent memory. What on earth is it all about? One suggested cause can surely be ruled out: that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, whose defection to VW sparked it all off, is a manager of irreplaceable talent. His record in cutting GM's costs in Europe is undeniable. But it must be absurd to suppose that the gap between him and the nearest equivalent from GM's three quarters of a million workforce is wide enough to account for the scale of the dispute. There is an altogether murkier alternative. GM, like VW, is engaged on developing a small car for the world market. Historically, the car industry has been unusual in its dependence on new models and the secrecy in which they are enveloped. But the level of aggression between GM and VW suggests there is more at stake than the shape of the boot or the design of the dashboard. GM has toiled for years to transform itself from a mass-production dinosaur to a flexible lean producer on the Japanese model. What if, for instance, GM has come up with genuine cost-saving innovations on the production line as a result of its labours on the multi-billion Saturn project? This is speculation, and is likely to remain so. Were GM to have any such innovations up its sleeve, it would scarcely be ready to share them with the world's press. But the idea would fit the accusations GM levels at Mr Lopez: that - for example - he requisitioned data from GM amounting to 90,000 sheets of paper, and that he tried to poach another seven top GM employees. VW's counter-accusations, lurid though they sound, merit serious consideration. Their main thrust is that GM has sought to plant commercial secrets in VW's computer system as a means of incriminating Mr Lopez: and that boxes of secret data found in a flat formerly occupied by defecting GM executives were planted by persons unknown or by GM itself. But that would imply that GM felt so threatened by Mr Lopez's managerial talents as to hand over sensitive commercial data in order to discredit him. In a case so bafflingly short of facts, the field is open to speculation. But two conclusions are clear. The first is that this dispute is getting to the point where both managements stand to suffer serious damage. The second is that the passionate commitment of both parties is clear evidence of an industry in trouble. The underlying issue has to do with declining sales and chronic overcapacity in the world car market. The more clamorous the argument, the more cause the car industry has to worry.

The police report that the members of this organization of  alleged money launderers had lived in Quito since 1987, so it is  assumed that in the last seven years they have conducted a  number of illicit money laundering activities, whose extent will  be determined as the investigations progress.    In addition to the weapons and communications equipment  confiscated by the police, a number of items and real estate  properties were seized, including expensive jewelry collections  valued at about $500,000 (approximately 1 billion sucres).    Seizures    Police spokespersons reported yesterday that to date 90  percent of the money launderers' assets have been confiscated.  These items include the house at No. 258 Calle Hidalgo de Pinto  y De la Alcabalas in the residential area of El Bosque which,  the police say, with all its contents, could be worth more than  $700,000 (over 1.4 billion sucres).    The Montenegro Freire family lived in this three-story house  with a penthouse, and from here they ran their illegal  businesses, using as a cover the luxury automobile dealership  located at Avenida Amazonas and Santa Maria.    In this house the police found a collection of 28 paintings  by a variety of artists, whose commercial value has not been  determined; it will, however, be several billion sucres. The  other assets, two apartments in exclusive Quito neighborhoods,  are valued at over 1 billion sucres.    Bank Accounts    According to the police, the persons arrested had numerous  accounts in various banks in Ecuador. Huge sums in both foreign  and national currency have been deposited in the last two years.    The investigations are continuing in order to determine the  precise amount of money the Montenegro Freire family had.    The police have said that details on the group's financial  movements will be released in the next few hours. Only the 8  million sucres seized in the initial raid have now been  reported. This amount was found in their residence.    Vehicles    So far 10 vehicles of different makes and models have been  seized, as well as three brand new motorcycles. The automobiles  included: a dark red BMW with no license plates valued at 260  million sucres; a red BMW with license plates PLH-058, valued at  100 million sucres; a black Mercedes-Benz with license plates  PLH-169, valued at 253 million sucres.

Ruling that the trial judge improperly admitted evidence of the defendant's  past violent acts, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ordered a  new trial for Kerry Lynn Brown, who is serving a life sentence for the  first-degree murder conviction.    Brown, 28, was found guilty by a federal jury of the April 26, 1986, killing of  mail carrier Dale J. Hooker, a 12-year postal employee who was struck by a  single shotgun blast as she stood on the porch of Brown's parents' home.      Defense Strategy    Brown himself had been shot in the jaw by an unidentified assailant three weeks  before the killing. His lawyer attempted to mount a diminished capacity  defense, arguing that Brown had an honest but unreasonable belief that he was  in danger and had a mental problem stemming from the earlier shooting.    To counter the defense claims, prosecutors introduced evidence that Brown had  been involved in two earlier wrongful acts. They said he fired shots into the  home of an acquaintance and, on another occasion, armed with a loaded rifle,  placed his finger on the trigger and approached an acquaintance, demanding that  he return a handgun that he had allegedly taken from Brown.    U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon had not allowed prosecutors to present all  the evidence they wanted to. For instance, the jury never heard that Brown  subsequently shot the acquaintance, Louis Lee, to death at point-blank range  and served three years in the California Youth Authority for involuntary  manslaughter.    They prosecution was also barred from disclosing that in 1979, Brown allegedly  tried to rob a Department of Motor Vehicles office by presenting a note that  said: ""This is a robbery. Don't make it a murder.""      Evidence Improper    Still, in an opinion written by Judge Edward Leavy, a three-judge panel held  that the evidence of prior wrongful acts that was presented was improper. Such  evidence is not admissible when it shows only that a defendant has a bad  character and is therefore more likely to have committed a crime, the court  said. Rather, the judges said, the evidence would have to show that Brown was  more likely to have intended to murder the postal carrier.    Assistant U.S. Atty. David Katz, who prosecuted the case, said he did not know  whether the government will appeal. ""It's very sad for the family (of Hooker),  because a retrial would be very hard on them,"" he said.    The decision was the second major setback this week for Judge Kenyon. On  Tuesday, the appeals court reversed the conviction of Richard W. Miller, a  former FBI agent who had been convicted after two trials in Kenyon's court on  charges of passing secrets to a Soviet spy.    Once the appeals court's order becomes final, Brown's lawyer could move to have  him freed on bail.

Now the 24-year-old immigrant faces a challenge nearly as daunting to her as  the struggles in her homeland. She is learning to drive a car.    Through war and revolution, Nguyen never had an opportunity to turn an ignition  key. And it shows. Though eager to get a driver's license, the bespectacled  refugee admits to having some qualms when she straps on a seat belt and grips  the steering wheel.    ""Driving a car is very difficult,"" Nguyen said one recent day in halting  English. ""I am afraid of freeways. Too fast. Very fast.""    Nguyen's anxiety over encountering the highways and byways of America is hardly  unique. Driving a car on the traffic-choked roads and freeways of Orange County  can be trying for even the most steely nerved native, but for recent arrivals  from places like Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, it can be a nightmare.    Hoping to help such immigrants, the state Department of Motor Vehicles has  begun a special effort to lower the language barriers and to better teach  foreign newcomers on the laws and nuances of the highway.    Dubbed the ""cultural outreach program,"" it features a series of videotapes and  booklets in nearly a dozen languages covering a variety of topics, including  basic rules of the road, the necessity of buying insurance, the evils of drunk  driving, what to do if an accident occurs and how to negotiate the twists and  turns of a DMV office.    ""Some of these people literally stepped out of the 18th Century and into the  20th Century when they came here,"" said Gary Quinliven, the program's  coordinator. ""Many of them have no idea of the rules of the road. Some have not  even seen a car, at least never on the scale as we have it here.""    Although the program began in late 1989, DMV officials estimate it has already  helped more than 1 million people in the state. A dozen other states, including  New York, are studying the California program to determine if they should  launch similar efforts.    About 50 school districts in California use the video series in courses for  newcomers. Among them is the Los Angeles Unified School District, which shows  the tapes in nearly 400 English language classes.    The series is also regularly aired in English and foreign-language versions by  about 100 cable TV outlets in California and five Spanish-speaking commercial  TV stations, DMV officials say. In addition, the tapes have been played at  several refugee centers in Thailand and the Philippines for immigrants destined  for the United States.    While the program initially focused on Southeast Asian languages, it was later  expanded to include Spanish, two Armenian tongues, and Mandarin, Cantonese and  Tagalog (the language of the Philippines).    ""These people have a different language than we have, they're trying to learn  how to get a job, get a place to live, how to shop in our markets, how to get  along in our world,"" Quinliven said. ""What we wanted to do was make it as easy  as possible to get into the world of driving a car.""    Indeed, there exists a fundamental urgency for many of the newcomers to get a  driver's license. With its sprawling suburbs and dearth of public  transportation, Southern California can represent an imposing challenge for a  newcomer without a car.    ""Learning to drive is very important for refugees,"" said Loc Ba Nguyen, refugee  coordinator for the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc. ""They know they  need a car. Orange County is very limited as far as public transportation, so  everyone wants to have a car.""    But the very act of driving can pose an awkward adjustment for immigrants.  Adults who have never commanded a car must learn a whole new system of eye and  muscle coordination. Newcomers from crowded foreign cities, meanwhile,  sometimes import motoring habits hardly in line with the California Vehicle  Code.    ""Many of these people just don't have a lot of experience driving,"" said Lt.  Michael Schliskey, police traffic commander in Westminster, which has a sizable  Vietnamese population.    Although the DMV is reluctant to break down motorist information along ethnic  lines, Schliskey said studies by his department indicate that in recent years  nearly three of four accidents in the city involve refugees from Indochina. The  bulk of those, he said, are in the Little Saigon section of Westminster.    No one knows the foibles and fears of such refugee drivers quite as well as  Michael Vo Duc Minh. Owner of the Little Saigon Traffic School and an auto  insurance agency, Vo deals firsthand with many of the problems of the immigrant  motorist.    ""It just takes time for them to adjust,"" said Vo, who came to the United States  in 1980 and started his traffic school last summer. ""It's not that the laws are  all that much different, it's just that people's attitudes are different.""    In Vietnam, for instance, many motorists would routinely start through a red  light when the signal on a cross street turns yellow, he said. Such a practice  in the United States promises only to result in the refugee driver running  afoul of the law -- or running into another car.    Vo said his classes, which are held in Vietnamese and serve people trying to  work traffic citations off their driving record, typically end up becoming  sessions on rudimentary rules of the road. ""Basically, we teach people from A  to Z about traffic law,"" he said.    As part of the sessions, which have been attended by more than 1,500 people, he  regularly uses the videotapes and booklets provided by the DMV.    ""I like the program,"" Vo said. ""It reviews all the basic law that people need  to know and it's done beautifully in their own language."" His only complaint is  that the translator has an accent ""from the extreme north"" of Vietnam, making  it sound akin to ""doing a Texas accent for an instructional tape that's shown  in New York.""    Likewise, Loc Ba Nguyen has found the DMV videos helpful for refugee seminars  at the Vietnamese Community of Orange County. But he said the program is not  nearly intensive enough for people who are driving for the first time.    Many newcomers, he said, end up trying to learn the mechanics of driving a car  from friends who arrived before them, and the friends are typically  ill-equipped to serve as instructors.    Phong Nguyen, 24, knows the trials and tribulations of a driving test. He came  to the United States earlier this year with his mother and immediately set  about trying to get his license, taking lessons from a private instructor for  $15 an hour.    The written test was ""no problem,"" he said, but the road test proved more  difficult. He flunked three times, but the fourth proved a charm.

0,FT944-13687 ,"FT944-13687 _AN-EJZDWAGJFT 941026   FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (5): Ford and Audi make light of motoring - The motor industry has joined producers in voicing optimism about the metal's future      By KENNETH GOODING   Mr Jacques Bougie, president of Alcan, the world's second largest aluminium group, let me borrow his car last month. He was prepared to do so because the car is significantly different - it is one of the first 40 'aluminium intensive vehicles' (AIVs) built by Ford. This fleet is based on the Mercury/Sable range, and gives the first clear indication that aluminium is suitable for the production of high volume, rather than just low volume 'niche' cars. Ford, the world's second largest automotive group, and Alcan believe they have overcome most of the problems associated with producing aluminium cars from an infrastructure which was set up to make them from steel. Ford still needs to conduct extensive manufacturing trials and consumer tests on the new AlV, and Mr Bougie's car is part of that programme. My half-hour drive from downtown Montreal to Dorval airport and back did not give much scope for serious testing. But back in May the AIV was given a much more gruelling try-out when four of the cars were taken to the Saint Eustache race track, near Montreal, to be put through their paces by some automotive writers and professional drivers. The drivers were also provided with equivalent steel-bodied cars - 400 lbs or 47 per cent heavier that the AIVs - to compare performances. After this test, Mr Jack Heebler, of Automotive News, reported: 'This car (the AIV) handles so well it's as if it has sticky tyres to help it hold the road. The AIV actually seems to carve through the turn without the heavy feeling of the steel-bodied car.' Similar favourable reviews greeted the Audi A8, the first production car to use aluminium as its primary structural material. This was good news for executives at the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) and at Audi who have spent the past 12 years in a co-operative research effort, and have invested a great deal in the project. Audi has spent about DM1bn (Dollars 650m) to bring the new luxury AS to market, and Alcoa has spent Dollars 70m for a plant at Soest, in Germany, where it is producing space frame components which it also hopes to sell to other car makers. Alcoa and Audi took a different route from Ford and Alcan. As aluminium is initially much more expensive than steel, they believed it would be too expensive simply to substitute aluminium components for those traditionally made of steel. Instead, they designed a car that has many fewer individual components and structures than are used in a steel vehicle. They developed a space frame, a skeleton-like body structure, composed of fewer than 100 extrusions and castings, compared with as many as 300 for a stamped steel body. Like Ford and Alcan, Alcoa and Audi had to develop new manufacturing processes to produce these space frames, and new aluminium alloys were also developed. All this activity has been prompted by increasingly stringent regulations covering both car fuel economy and emissions. This is a global trend, but is strongest in developed markets such as the US, western Europe and Japan. Both requirements can be met by lighter vehicles. And, as customers are resisting any attempts to make cars much smaller, designers are focusing on lighter materials to replace steel and plastics. Aluminium used in a typical US car has grown from 50 lbs in the 1960s to nearly 200 lbs today. Most of that extra aluminium has been used in components once made of steel or cast iron. There is still growth to come from this substitution process. Alcan's Mr Bougie says that demand growth of about 6.6 per cent a year can be expected for such things as castings, forgings and some aluminium sheet for cars, from today's starting point of 4m tonnes. However, now 'both Alcan and Alcoa have demonstrated the use of aluminium in car structures, this gives us growth potential for another 20 years. But the big growth does not come until after the year 2000. Aluminium structures in high volume models do not come until 2000 to 2005.' At present, the Audi-Alcoa technology is not economically viable for cars produced at a rate of more than 100,000 a year. Mr Bougie points out that Alcan's technology was from the start aimed at high-volume production of mid-sized cars. 'It is in the mass-produced models that the real volume market lies, a market we should see developing over the next five to ten years.' Mr Donald Macmillan, vice-president and general manager (automotive) for Alcan Rolled Products, whose job puts him face to face with the US car companies in Detroit, says the automotive groups are preparing themselves for even tighter regulations, and that, in order to achieve those new standards, they will need to hit higher miles per gallon figures with high-volume, mainstream vehicles. When a car is designed specifically to be made of aluminium, secondary weight savings can be incorporated - a lighter body means that engines can be smaller, braking systems do not have to be so powerful, and so on. There are still some question-marks over the use of aluminium in cars - questions about aluminium's reparability and its cost. A recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology study showed that car-makers were having to spend an extra Dollars 1.50 a car for every lb saved - not particularly welcomed by an industry that likes pinching its pennies. The motor industry is also worried about the volatility of aluminium prices. Both Alcoa's chairman, Mr Paul 0'Neill, and Mr Macmillan, of Alcan, insist, however, that 'life of car' stable prices can be offered as long as these reflect the cost of replacing the smelters used to produce the metal. The North American groups are not the only ones likely to share in the potential bonanza. Hydro Aluminium, part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group and Europe's biggest producer of aluminium extrusions, has a vested interest in the success of the space-frame concept, which could be a big user of extrusions. Hydro has been successfully co-operating on car space-frame concepts since the mid 1980s with various groups, including Renault in France, Porsche in Germany and Pininfarina in Italy. Alusuisse-Lonza, of Switzerland, has a virtual monopoly in the supply of aluminium sheet for the car industry in Europe, because it has developed and patented an alloy that other companies prefer to use under licence rather than develop an equivalent material. There is still a possibility that the avalanche of new business that the aluminium industry hopes for from the motor industry will not materialise, and executives remain cautious about some of the more extravagant forecasts being made. The steel and plastics producers are working hard to ensure their car business is not further eroded. Already a lightweight cast iron for automotive components available is available from Sintercast, a Michigan-based, Swedish-American company.

0,FT943-1682 ,"FT943-1682 _AN-EIWEEAAYFT 940923   FT  23 SEP 94 / Chinese will be encouraged to buy cars      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   China will soon begin providing incentives to individual car buyers to help boost its fledgling automotive sector as part of a policy aimed at encouraging widespread car ownership. Speaking after a two-day conference in Beijing, Mr He Guangyuan, China's minister of machinery, said that individuals would become the main purchasers of cars and the incentives were designed to encourage this trend. Mr He did not provide details but it seemed he was proposing that bank loans or other forms of finance be made available to facilitate car purchases. The official China Daily newspaper reported officials responsible for the automotive sector as saying that to 'increase sales the state will introduce incentives to car buyers to boost market demand'. Individuals, as opposed to companies and work units, make up only a fraction of car owners. Of the estimated 1.2m cars on China's roads 5 per cent are owned privately, according to China Daily. Mr He also announced the government would increase its support over the next two years for four existing car makers in an effort to boost production. China's new automotive policy sets as its goal the development of a mass production automotive sector by early next century to meet an expected booming demand for cars. China's production goal for the year 2000 is some 1.35m cars, with 90 per cent of the market to be supplied from local production. Output would rise to 4m by the year 2010. In 1993, China produced 234,000 passenger cars out of total production nationwide of 1.3m vehicles. More than 300,000 vehicles including trucks, commercial vehicles and cars were imported. Among manufacturers singled out for government support were those in which Volkswagen of Germany and Daihatsu of Japan are involved. Mr He did not provide details of assistance, but Beijing recently announced it would provide additional funds for the automotive sector. The authorities are also making clear they will play an active role in the rationalisation of an industry whose production has hitherto been scattered among dozens of small inefficient plants, some of which produce a few vehicles each month. Thousands of components manufacturers are also being warned that unless they achieve economies of scale through mergers or joint ventures with foreign partners they will be forced out of business. Mr He announced that some 350 components businesses out of an estimated 4,800 throughout China would get government assistance. Again, no detail was provided of the form this assistance might take. China has placed a freeze on new automotive manufacturers entering the market until 1996, but international companies are being urged to participate in upgrading the components sector. Such companies as Ford, GM, Toyota and Nissan, have been told that to participate in the components sector is virtually a prerequisite for permission to become involved in manufacturing. This has prompted a scramble for Chinese partners among component suppliers.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

0,FT931-4361 ,"FT931-4361 _AN-DCKCYADUFT 930311   FT  11 MAR 93 / Ford attacks Japanese rivals: UK job losses blamed on 'transplant factories' as staff back strike      By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent   JAPANESE motor companies with plants in Britain were partially blamed yesterday by Mr Ian McAllister, Ford UK's chairman and managing director, for his company's threat to make compulsory redundancies. His strong attack, in written evidence to the House of Commons employment committee, coincided with a vote yesterday by Ford's white-collar staff to authorise a strike if compulsory redundancies go ahead. Leaders of manual unions meet Ford management today to discuss how compulsory redundancies will affect their members. If Ford refuses to back down, the manual unions are also expected to ballot for strike action. Mr McAllister told MPs: 'With the growing presence of Japanese transplant assembly facilities in Britain operating with the advantages of a greenfield site and extremely low levels of engineering and manufacturing integration, it should not be surprising that an established company such as Ford must shed labour to ensure its future competitiveness and prosperity.' He warned of future job losses in the UK motor industry be-cause of Japanese companies, ac-cusing them of 'creating excess capacity which, given a market of finite size, is likely to displace equivalent jobs in existing producers', as well as 'having generally lower local content levels which displaces jobs at both manufacturers and suppliers'. He said: 'Their products and components are wholly designed and developed in Japan and must give rise to real concerns for the UK's technological base.' Mr McAllister said that in what he called the 'Japanese transplant factories', the 'integration levels for design and manufacture are significantly below those of established producers'. Under questioning from MPs, he warned of the danger of a technological brain-drain to Japan. 'Within a few years, the technical expertise which exists today in the UK supply base may no longer be capable of supporting the long-range research and development requirements of the motor industry. The suppliers will become no more than 'makers' of Japanese design parts.' In oral evidence to MPs, Ford's senior management said 262 more staff jobs had to go by April 16, of 2,100 called for in December while 318 more manual workers were required to accept voluntary redundancy out of the 1,180 originally needed. This suggests Ford might reach its manpower cut target without the need for compulsory redundancies. In the ballot of Ford's 10,000 white-collar staff at its 21 UK plants, 50 per cent of 6,500 members of the Manufacturing, Scientific and Finance Union voted - 64 per cent supporting the strike call. The vote among white-collar members of the TGWU general union was much narrower - 53 per cent were ready to back a strike. Staff union officials will meet Ford on March 23 to discuss the issue.

0,FT932-16815 ,"FT932-16815 _AN-DDDAIADBFT 930403   FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz drops takeover shield      By DAVID WALLER      FRANKFURT   DAIMLER-BENZ is to abandon its main protection against an unwelcome takeover by dissolving a special holding company that owns 25 per cent of its shares. Mercedes Holding was set up in 1975 to stop the Shah of Iran from buying a big stake in Germany's biggest industrial company. The Mercedes Holding shares will be converted into Daimler shares later this year on a one-for-one basis, Daimler said yesterday. The holding company has no connection with Daimler's Mercedes-Benz car subsidiary and, although quoted, its sole purpose is to hold a 25.23 per cent stake in Daimler. The announcement prompted a sharp drop in Daimler's share price and is likely to lead to a significant increase in the price of Mercedes Holding shares on Monday. They are on a 20 per cent discount to Daimler shares. The move will be seen as a victory for shareholder rights activists who last January launched a campaign for the abolition of the holding company. Analysts said the move was linked with Daimler's decision to list on the New York Stock Exchange later this year, where such shareholding structures are viewed as anachronistic and contrary to the interests of institutional investors. The break-up of the company will also help Daimler in its long-frustrated plans to hold a DM2bn rights issue, originally intended for last year but postponed due to poor conditions on the German equity market. For technical reasons, the holding company makes it difficult to raise equity capital, as Daimler intends to do next year. Mercedes Holding was put together at the initiative of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank and biggest shareholder in Daimler with a 28 per cent stake. In the mid-1970s, Mr Friedrich Karl Flick, the industrialist, wanted to sell the bulk of his 39 cent stake in Daimler to Iran. Deutsche Bank objected, fearing that the crown jewels of German industry would end up being controlled from the Gulf. The bank bought 25 per cent itself, before selling it on to the newly-created special holding company. Half of its shares are owned by two holding companies, Stella Automobil and Stern Automobil, which are in turn owned by a number of banks and industrial companies, including Allianz, the insurer, as well as Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, Germany's second and third biggest banks, and Robert Bosch, the car components company. The remaining shares are owned by around 60,000 individual and institutional shareholders, which collect a dividend from Daimler but have no direct vote in the industrial conglomerate's affairs. Daimler refused to comment yesterday on what would happen to the shares owned by Stella and Stern. Analysts speculated that some of the shares could be used to sell to US investors in connection with the New York listing. Some explained the fall in the Daimler share price yesterday as reflecting perceptions that large blocks of shares would now come on to the market.   Companies:-  Daimler-Benz.

0,FT942-8424 ,"FT942-8424 _AN-EETCSAECFT 940520   FT  20 MAY 94 / Honda and Rover heal rift over sale to BMW      By KEVIN DONE and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO      LONDON, TOKYO   Honda, the Japanese carmaker, and Rover, the UK subsidiary of BMW of Germany, are to continue collaboration on the development of future car models well into the next decade. The two carmakers announced yesterday that they had signed a series of contracts, which confounded earlier fears that the 15-year alliance between Rover and Honda would be brought to an end by the Pounds 800m takeover by BMW of the leading UK carmaker from British Aerospace earlier this year. Honda will still go ahead with its withdrawal from its 20 per cent equity holding in Rover - expected to be completed next month - but it has agreed to continue long-term co-operation. Honda was initially angry with BAe's sale of Rover to BMW, announced at the end of January, and at the apparent betrayal of the close working relationship that had developed between the two groups. This led to widespread concerns that the move could jeopardise continued Japanese investment in Britain. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said healing the rift was 'good news for the companies, for the UK and for Japanese firms based in this country'. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chief executive and chairman of Rover, said all current supplier and licensing agreements between Honda and Rover would remain intact. Mr Pischetsrieder said work on cars in development would also be completed. This covers the replacements for the current Honda Concerto and Rover 200/400. Mr John Towers, chief executive of Rover, said collaboration would go into other new model generations. It is understood that this could also include the future replacements for the Rover 600 and Honda Accord cars. Mr Towers said that the new agreements 'could take us well to 2006. The way we work together in the future will not be very different to how it has been in the last two to three years'. He said one of the Japanese carmaker's chief concerns had been the access that BMW might gain to Honda technology. This concern had been met by the new agreements with Honda. 'There will be confidentiality walls around what we do with Honda, which will be clearly visible,' said Mr Towers. 'What is sensitive is Honda's intellectual property rights and expertise. It is easy to organise ourselves so that a particular set of products will be confidential to Honda and ourselves. In another sector we may be collaborating with BMW.' Honda is moving towards ensuring its UK production could eventually stand alone, if necessary. It said it was planning to invest in its own 'limited' sheet metal pressing facility at its plant at Swindon. At present, virtually all its sheet metal pressings are supplied by Rover's separate stamping plant at Swindon.

0,FT933-14894 ,"FT933-14894 _AN-DGLB7ACVFT 930712   FT  12 JUL 93 / Letter: Why Commission deserves two cheers on EC car pricing      From Mr STEPHEN LOCKE   Sir, It is hard to avoid the conclusion that John Griffiths ('Exchange rates main factor in European car price comparisons,' July 5) is looking through the wrong end of the telescope in assessing the reasons for differences in car prices between EC member states. Exchange rates in themselves are no more responsible for price differences than the Retail Price Index is a cause of inflation: they are merely a means of translating one country's prices into a form which can be compared with another's. Short-term fluctuations - especially dramatic ones such as those associated with the exit of sterling, the lira, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo from the Exchange Rate Mechanism last September - may upset long-established comparisons, but they do not invalidate them. The fact is that pre-tax car prices in the UK were well above those in most other EC countries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s; even the substantial fall in sterling against the D-Mark, Belgian franc, French franc and Dutch guilder within the last year has done no more than shift the general level of UK prices to roughly the EC average, with some models still costing 20 to 30 per cent more than in other countries. Whether even this state of affairs remains depends heavily on the car manufacturers' pricing policies in the UK, and on the manufacturers' ability to resist the temptation to return to their old view of this country as a high-price, high-profit market where consumer interests come a long way down the list of corporate priorities. What underlying factors should guide car pricing in different EC countries is an interesting issue for debate, as John Griffiths identifies. It may well be that in a completely unrestrained market subject to differing tax treatments in different areas, manufacturers would be justified in varying their pre-tax prices in a way that maximises their investment returns. But we don't have an unrestrained market - EC limits on price differences were introduced as part of the 'deal' on selective and exclusive distribution reached between the Commission and the manufacturers. Also, the Commission, rightly, wanted to demonstrate the benefits that could flow directly to consumers from a single, barrier-free market in the crucially important cars sector. For its efforts so far the Commission deserves at least two cheers from the consumer corner - and the new data that will be generated by these twice-yearly car price comparisons will start to give us a clear, authoritative picture of whether the EC single market for cars is a myth or, at last, a reality.

0,FT931-8017 ,"FT931-8017 _AN-DBVBWAALFT 930222   FT  22 FEB 93 / Bad times loom for German carmakers      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      SEVILLE   GERMAN CAR makers face at least five bleak and uncertain years ahead, according to Mr David Herman, new chairman of Adam Opel, the local subsidiary of General Motors of the US. Consumer confidence was in free fall, he said at the weekend. Business confidence was still near post-war lows, but the recent plunge in morale had been the steepest in almost 50 years. It would be more than five years before Opel's output returned to the levels of the recent past. Mr Herman's grim forecasts followed news that German car production tumbled 27 per cent in January, while output of commercial vehicles was 57 per cent lower than a year earlier. Meanwhile, Volkswagen, the country's leading volume carmaker, confirmed that it was considering extending short-time working into the second quarter of this year. Opel, No 2 behind VW, has drastically downgraded its expectations. A fresh analysis of the company's medium-term business plans had resulted in forecasts for annual output being cut by an average 7 or 8 per cent, Mr Herman said. The current recession was unusual; a 'normal' slump lasted one or two years and was followed by a reasonably sharp upturn. This time he could see no possibility of such a recovery. Apart from recession the industry had to make allowances for the effects of Bonn's plans to increase oil taxes and levy tolls on motorway users. 'Even now drivers pay twice as much on vehicle and fuel taxes as is paid out for road construction and maintenance,' he claimed. Motor manufacturing was Germany's single most important industry; it was time to consider the effects of higher levies on investment and employment. Mr Herman, speaking at the launch in Seville, Spain, of the company's new Corsa compact car (sold as the Nova in Britain), said production on the new model would rise from 90,000 this year to 100,000 in 1994. Meanwhile, annual capacity would be increased to 400,000, split between the group's plants in Saragossa, Spain, and its new low-cost showpiece works in Eisenach, eastern Germany. Compacts now account for 20 per cent of the German market, where General Motors companies sold 658,000 vehicles last year - 8 per cent fewer than in 1991. Some 40 per cent of all GM's European sales are made in Germany. The nosedive in January output, reported by the VDA industry association, followed the introduction of short-time working in most domestic vehicle plants. Output is being reduced to cope with falls in domestic demand expected to range between 15 and 20 per cent this year. Meanwhile, car exports dropped by an adjusted 12 per cent and truck shipments abroad fell by half, the VDA said. New car registrations in west Germany were down 28 per cent during the month. But the figure was distorted by exceptional demand towards the end of last year, when buyers rushed to avoid the January 1 increase in value added tax.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT933-14710 ,"FT933-14710 _AN-DGMB6ADVFT 930713   FT  13 JUL 93 / Probe widens as secret GM papers are found: Prosecutors look for link to VW production head      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   GERMAN prosecutors are looking for links between Volkswagen's controversial new production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and secret General Motors' documents found in a Wiesbaden apartment, according to legal officials. The investigation of the US group's claims that Mr Lopez and junior colleagues took confidential information with them when they defected to VW this spring took a new turn yesterday after confirmation from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, that the discovery included details of a top-secret model it was planning. It also emerged that Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre, who lived in the apartment until recently, was formerly involved in Opel's new model policy through his job as head of Opel's advance purchasing department. Mr Alvarez was one of two Opel employees who switched to VW shortly after Mr Lopez, head of global purchasing at GM, joined the German company in March. A further five members of his US team also moved to VW at around the same time. 'It is not only a question of the papers we found. We also have to see if there is proof that Mr Lopez has anything to do with the matter,' Mr Georg Nauth, spokesman for the Darmstadt prosecutor's office, said yesterday. Interviews with VW and Opel employees were continuing, but the issues raised by the Wiesbaden discovery made it 'hard to say' how long the investigation would last, Mr Nauth said. There were many questions to be answered. For example: 'If Mr Lopez had asked to see or saw the papers.' Four boxes of documents had been discovered, 'which did not belong where they were found', Mr Nauth added. He refused to confirm that they included details of Opel's most important current project - a cheap mini-car codenamed the O-car. But that was not to say reports to that effect were wrong, he noted. The O-car is due for launch in the second half of this decade. The concept bears a striking resemblance to a projected 'people's car' announced since Mr Lopez's arrival by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman. Opel's plans for a super-lean works to make the vehicle, provisionally earmarked for Hungary, also closely match those unveiled recently by Mr Lopez for his homeland in the Basque country, northern Spain. Mr Lopez played a leading role in developing Opel's project, and it was his disappointment that it would not be built in Spain which led to him leaving GM and being appointed head of production at VW. VW, which last week stated that the Basque works would not be built 'at this time', yesterday repeated its claim that none of the documents was secret. A lawyer speaking for Mr Alvarez made a similar claim although he admitted he had not seen the papers. GM cautious on third quarter, Page 22   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     General Motors Corp.

It reached agreement yesterday on a joint production venture with Mayflower, the specialist UK engineering company, which will invest in the MG development programme and share the profits. Code-named PR3, the new MG sports car is expected to be a mid-engined roadster priced from about Pounds 15,000. Output is planned to reach 15,000 to 20,000 a year, and the range is expected to be sold in Japan. The sports car will be powered at the top end of the range by Rover's K-Series engine in a new 1.6-litre version, which is under development. Rover, the vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, is seeking to resurrect one of the world's best-known sports car marques more than a decade after MG was killed off in 1980 by Sir Michael Edwardes, then British Leyland chairman. The new model is intended to return MG to the mainstream sports car market, a segment dominated in recent years by Japanese manufacturers with products such as the Mazda MX-5. Rover has awarded the contract for the design, development and supply of the sports car body shell to Mayflower's Coventry-based automotive engineering subsidiary, Motor Panels. Mayflower is to invest up to Pounds 24.2m for the initial engineering design, development and tooling work including the necessary production facilities for the body shells. It will produce the MG body panels and supply the welded bodies to Rover for painting and final assembly. The body shell production contract is expected to run for six years with a sales value for Mayflower of about Pounds 20m a year. Rover opened the way for the long-awaited revival of the MG marque last autumn with the unveiling of the MG RV8, a redesigned and more powerful variant of the MGB sports car, last produced in 1980. The Pounds 26,500 MG RV8 was developed to mark the 30th anniversary of the MGB, of which more than 500,000 were built. It is being produced at a maximum volume of only 15 a week and was intended to resurrect the MG name as a precursor to the resumption of volume sports car production with the PR3 project. In less than four years Rover has renewed most of its product range. This started with the launch of the 200/400 series, the Land Rover Discovery and a re-engineered Metro in 1989 and 1990, followed by a revamped Rover 800 in 1991 and the recent launch of the Rover 600 large family car. Rover and Mayflower would not comment yesterday. Rover said: 'We do not discuss future products or detailed commercial negotiations.'   Companies:-  Rover Group.

0,FT933-11702 ,"FT933-11702 _AN-DG1B8AD8FT 930728   FT  28 JUL 93 / GM accused of trying to destroy Volkswagen: Computer 'hacking' charges described as absurd      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   MR Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, has launched a ferocious counter-attack on General Motors, accusing the US group of trying to destroy his company and undermine the German economy. Goaded into action by legal setbacks and continued harassment by GM lawyers, Mr Piech suggested that agents of the US group or disaffected VW employees might have 'hacked' into Volkswagen's computer system to plant GM secrets in the German group's network. He also implied that GM could have put confidential information in boxes found in a house formerly occupied by two VW employees who moved from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, in late March. Opel described the charges, to be published tomorrow in Stern, an illustrated weekly, as 'absurd'. Mr Piech's attack is expected to continue at a hurriedly called press conference in Wolfsburg today. After weeks of restricting its statements to flat denials of all charges and allegations of industrial espionage against former GM employees now at VW, the German group has swung on to the offensive. 'This is mud-slinging,' Mr Piech told Stern. 'And if we are to be attacked with dirt, we must defend ourselves accordingly.' He accepted that if Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former global purchasing chief at GM and now VW production director, was proved to have spied on the US company, then he himself would suffer 'grave consequences'. 'But this will not happen,' he claimed. If he and Mr Lopez went, then the 'English disease' - the collapse of industry and Japanese domination - would break out . . . and not only at VW. Our opponents would have achieved what they wanted. They would have won a war.' Mr Piech told the magazine that an internal audit of VW computer programmes was under way to see if 'anything has been foisted on us'. If anything was found, then VW would go to state prosecutors and make charges. Referring to four boxes containing secret GM data, allegedly left in a Wiesbaden house by Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Mr Rosario Piazza, two former Opel managers now at VW, he said there was 'a striking conflict between my colleagues' affidavits and the items found in Wiesbaden'. The boxes 'could have been at the disposal of our opponents and then handed to the police,' Mr Piech stated. The issue of what was in the boxes originally and what they contained now was an open question. VW last week failed in a court attempt to stop Der Spiegel, the weely news magazine, continuing to report damaging allegations against Mr Lopez and VW. It later suffered a further blow when prosecutors investigating spying charges established links between Mr Lopez and the Wiesbaden boxes. On Monday Opel lawyers 'suggested' that Hamburg prosecutors should examine the contradictions between GM employees' testimony and affidavits from Mr Piech, Mr Lopez and others.

0,FT944-5636 ,"FT944-5636 _AN-ELBDWAD8FT 941202   FT  02 DEC 94 / VW and Ford to end joint venture in Latin America      By PATRICK MCCURRY and KEVIN DONE      SAO PAULO, LONDON   Volkswagen and Ford are to break up their partnership in Autolatina, Latin America's biggest carmaker and one of the biggest joint ventures in the world auto industry. The two companies announced yesterday that they had agreed on 'a gradual separation process leading toward dissolution' within a year of the Autolatina joint venture in Brazil and Argentina. The joint venture, which was formed in 1987, is owned 51 per cent by Germany's VW, Europe's biggest carmaker, and 49 per cent by Ford of the US, the world's second-largest vehicle maker. Mr Wayne Booker, executive vice-president for Ford's international automotive operations, said Ford believed that it would 'be better able to compete effectively in these two markets by operating on its own'. In the second half of the 1980s, 'difficult market and economic conditions' had made the co-operation a good strategy, but conditions were now 'significantly different in both countries'. Autolatina Brasil was the country's largest private-sector company last year with sales of Dollars 7.2bn (Pounds 4.4bn) and production of 612,000 vehicles. The separation had been expected for some time. In August, Autolatina Brasil, which has 47,000 workers in Brazil, said it would no longer launch new hybrid models built on shared production platforms, but instead use the world platforms supplied by the parent companies. The decision was partly triggered by pressure from VW car dealers, who were reluctant to turn over the platform for the new model of Brazil's best-selling Gol car to Ford, and by a realisation that consumer brand awareness was suffering. The companies had been concerned that Autolatina's structure was holding back their growth in Brazil's booming car market. Since 1990, Ford's market share has slumped from 18.8 to 12 per cent while VW is down from 37.4 to 33.6 per cent. During the same period Fiat's subsidiary has nearly doubled its market share to 26.2 per cent. Autolatina executives say the dissolution was the result of Brazil's move from a closed economy to an increasingly open one as well as the increased globalisation of the car industry. When the holding company was created in 1987, Brazil's economy was generally closed to international competition and car sales were depressed. Joining forces allowed Ford and VW to pool investment and production costs. But since 1990 the economy has been gradually opened, leading to growing competition from imports, and in the last two years Brazil's car market has boomed thanks to lower prices sparked by falling taxes and higher productivity. Brazilian vehicle production soared from 1.07m vehicles in 1992 to a probable 1.6m this year. Disentangling VW and Ford from Autolatina is likely to be a long and complicated process. In Brazil they jointly operate seven plants, six of which are in the state of Sao Paulo, making engines, transmission systems and other parts. They also operate jointly in areas such as purchasing, administration, finance and legal services.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Ford Motor.     Autolatina Argentina.     Autolatina Brasil.

0,FT943-12344 ,"FT943-12344 _AN-EGZEHAB1FT 940726   FT  26 JUL 94 / Rover hints at expanding production capacity      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Rover Group said yesterday that it may need to review its carmaking capacity next year if the company's upturn in worldwide sales is sustained this year and then strengthened - as expected - by new models to be introduced early next year. Rover, which was bought early this year by BMW, the German carmaker, for Pounds 800m plus debt assumptions, yesterday reported a rise of 16 per cent in worldwide sales in the first half of this year. The increase, to 234,600 from 202,100 in the same period last year, took sales to their highest level for four years. Production rose even more sharply, to 251,900 from 206,500 - up 22 per cent to a five-year high. Within these totals the biggest increases were accounted for by the Land Rover four-wheel-drive subsidiary. Its Discovery model has proved one of Rover's biggest successes and it has just announced a Pounds 68m investment to expand total Land Rover capacity. First-half production of Rover cars was 19 per cent higher, at 208,300. The group's rising car sales worldwide, particularly in export markets - many of which are still in recession - indicate that Rover is steadily taking market share from its rivals. Total export sales in the six months rose 29 per cent to more than 106,000, accounting for 45 per cent of Rover's total. The indication that Rover may have to consider expanding capacity came from Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive. In recent years Rover has presented itself as having the goal of becoming a profitable 'niche' producer of about 500,000 vehicles a year, each targeted at the premium end of its market. Mr Towers said yesterday he expected sales to continue to strengthen in the second half of the year, lifting total sales to about the 500,000 mark. However, he said Rover could be 'comfortable' with demand-driven expansion to 650,000. He added: 'It is possible that by the back end of 1995 we will be reviewing how that situation can be accommodated.' Mr Towers said that the gains made this year did not yet reflect any of the product expansion and global marketing advantages Rover expected to gain from the relationship with its new parent company. While Mr Towers said that no significant new projects were at present under discussion with Honda, its former partner, further collaboration with the Japanese carmaker beyond present commitments should not be ruled out. Although Rover this year is only returning to production levels reached five years ago, the background against which it is producing vehicles is more favourable than in the past. Production then was declining, while Rover is now encountering production constraints with its new 600 model. Early next year it will launch successors to its biggest-selling 200 and 400 models, as well as new 'niche' products such as a small MG sports car.   Companies:-  Rover Group.

0,FT933-14994 ,"FT933-14994 _AN-DGLB7AECFT 930710   FT  10 JUL 93 / US-Japanese trade deal caps Tokyo summit      By JUREK MARTIN      TOKYO   THE US and Japan this morning reached agreement on a broad negotiating framework designed to open Japan's markets to American goods and to reduce the size of its bilateral Dollars 50bn trade surplus. The agreement, only concluded after all-night bargaining, appears to crown a successful summit in Tokyo of the world's largest industrialised nations for President Bill Clinton. Earlier, leaders of the Group of Seven had given the 'highest priority' to concluding the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations. Mr Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, jointly announced their resolution in brief statements. Shortly before, the president had held a brief press conference with President Boris Yeltsin, in which he said the US and Russia would propose a tripartite agreement to persuade Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons. Neither the US nor the Japanese leader were immediately specific about the details. Mr Miyazawa said, generally, that Japan would expand access to its markets, increase the transparency of its policy-making and promote deregulation in return for continued progress in reducing the US budget deficit. Mr Clinton said the framework approach - in his words, 'a good beginning' - meant a series of 'results-oriented' agreements to be negotiated sector-by-sector over the next six months. He mentioned cars, telecommunications, computers, medical equipment, financial services and insurance. A US official characterised the accord as giving the US rather more than it expected in setting numerical targets for opening up specific Japanese sectors to US products and services. But Japan had resisted some US macro-economic demands. Concluding their three-day economic summit, the G7 members  - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada  - yesterday supported a fresh effort to reach agreement by the end of this year in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A communique also said they had agreed to promote long-term growth by trying to co-operate in reforming labour markets, social security and health-care systems. Earlier, Mr Clinton said: 'All of us are mindful that we have a long way to go to restore real growth and opportunity to the global economy, but we have made a serious start.'. He cited Wednesday's agreement by the US, Canada, Japan and the European Community to reduce or eliminate import tariffs on a range of manufactured goods, which he said would help bring global trade talks to a successful conclusion. On Russia, Mr Clinton said the Dollars 3bn programme to help privatise state-owned industries 'will not only bolster prospects for freedom there, it is a very solid investment for the US'. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the summit, with its progress on trade, had been better 'than I anticipated and better than most people expected'.

0,FT933-9672 ,"FT933-9672 _AN-DHIDBAANFT 930809   FT  09 AUG 93 / VW steers cautiously through a minefield      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   A MONTH or more after joining Volkswagen, former General Motors managers were still working diligently on their old employer's behalf. Shredding documents is not the sort of work automotive purchasing and production men are used to, but they got on with the job. According to Volkswagen, they took pains to ensure that documents which could 'possibly' belong to GM and could 'possibly' contain sensitive information were destroyed. Their aim was to 'avoid any danger' that the information should fall into VW hands - in other words they were working in the interests of their ex-employer, General Motors. Eye-witnesses said two of the group, Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre and Mr Rosario Piazza, worked through one night in April, filling a van parked outside a Wiesbaden house 'metres-high' with bags of confetti. According to VW, others carried out their shredding in the Gastehaus Rotehof, a comfortable Wolfsburg hostelry owned by Volkswagen and used customarily for entertaining distinguished visitors. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, newly appointed production director and ex-GM global buying chief, for example, stayed there while house-hunting. In one 30-line statement, issued close to midnight on Friday, Volkswagen effectively put paid to its new employees' persistent claims that none of them took any documents when they left GM and Adam Opel, the US group's German subsidiary last March. Since GM papers are now admitted to have been in the hands of VW employees on VW property, it may make it more difficult for the German group to sustain claims that no secrets made their way to the Volkswagen headquarters at Wolfsburg. Opel said yesterday that the weekend's admissions - notably on the Rotehof shredding activities - would be of particular significance to public prosecutors investigating suspicions of industrial espionage against Mr Lopez and three associates. The bizarre statement, which emerged after a meeting of the German group's supervisory board, was otherwise much as expected. The board, which hires, fires and ensures the decent conduct of executives, restated 'unaltered confidence' in Mr Lopez and in chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech's claim that the group would break even this year. As befits a case in which disappearing acts have so far been everyday occurrences, there was much missing from the board's declaration. There was, for instance, no mention of the shredders' names and no explanation of how or why the papers were taken or sent to Wolfsburg. But something else was missing. Although the statement reiterated its support for Mr Lopez, there was no mention of a declaration two weeks ago in which an elite group of senior supervisory directors said they would stand by him unless and until he was found guilty. Volkswagen is hanging on to its miracle-worker, but its grip appears to have loosened. But as in the past, the group refrained from offering any explicit support for his colleagues. Indeed, the shredding revelations suggested more than ever that Mr Lopez's associates have been cut adrift.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     Volkswagen.     Adam Opel.

0,FT934-4630 ,"FT934-4630 _AN-DLFC8AERFT 931202   FT  02 DEC 93 / Volvo plans for merger hit by wave of dissent      By HUGH CARNEGY and JOHN RIDDING      STOCKHOLM, PARIS   Volvo's ambitious plans to merge with France's Renault were under renewed threat last night after the Swedish group's third-largest shareholder joined a growing chorus of opposition to the deal. The call by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken Funds, which controls 5.7 per cent of Volvo's voting capital, for the merger to be postponed brought to seven the number of Swedish institutional shareholders that have said they will not support the deal at a special shareholders meeting next Tuesday. With only two Swedish institutions independent of Volvo pledged in favour, opponents called on Volvo not to proceed. Volvo declined official comment, but a senior executive said: 'We are, of course, taking the situation very seriously'. Volvo's share price rose steeply on speculation that the merger would fail. The most-traded B share closed at SKr444 (Dollars 51), up SKr30 from Tuesday's close. Votes committed against the merger still trail those in favour by a margin of between 10 and 6 per cent of the votes. But the Yes camp includes Renault's 10 per cent holding and the opposition now holds a clear lead among the independent institutions. Volvo admits it is reluctant to push through the deal on a narrow majority. Renault said that while yesterday's developments were obviously unwelcome it had no new plans ahead of the shareholder vote and would await next week's decision. A French government official adopted a similar stance, adding that the French side had done all it could to reassure Swedish investors and clarify points of concern about the deal. Doubt was also cast yesterday over the decision of one of the supporting institutions. The board of the Fourth Fund state pension fund, the biggest Volvo shareholder after Renault, is set to reconsider its narrow 8-6 vote in favour of the merger at a meeting tomorrow. This follows the revelation that the fund's chief executive also sits on the board of a Volvo subsidiary. Today, attention will focus on a decision expected from the SPP insurance company which holds 4.5 per cent of the Volvo votes. S-E Banken Funds, which has a close relationship with the Volvo board, did not reject the merger outright, but said a final decision should be postponed until next April. The funds sharply criticised the information provided by Volvo on the merger, saying it was not sufficiently detailed to allow a proper evaluation of the values placed on Volvo assets. Under the merger plan, Volvo would put all its core car, truck and bus making operations into the new Renault-Volvo company in exchange for a 35 per cent shareholding. 'The information was not up to the standard we like to have in such an important case as this,' said Mr Peter Thelin, S-E Banken Funds chief executive. He also said time was needed to 'repair the damage' caused by what had become an emotional tussle between Volvo and its shareholders. Background, Page 18   Companies:-  Volvo.     Renault.

0,FT933-12226 ,"FT933-12226 _AN-DGZB2AATFT 930726   FT  26 JUL 93 / Biggest VW shareholder backs Lopez      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   MR Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony, has restated his support for Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's production director, despite mounting evidence to support industrial spying allegations against him. The statement from Mr Schroder, followed a hurriedly called meeting on Friday with Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman. The state's 20 per cent stake lost an estimated DM300m (Pounds 116m) of its value last week as legal setbacks lopped 7 per cent off VW shares. It has since emerged that Mr Lopez, linked last Thursday by state prosecutors with one batch of confidential documents belonging to General Motors, his former employer, and found in a Wiesbaden house, had personally collected some of the others. In early February, more than a month before he abruptly joined VW, he visited Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, from his Detroit base, to attend meetings called at his request. On February 3 and 4, during the presentations, he asked managers from the group's European subsidiaries for papers on purchasing, cost and new model strategies. Some of these later turned up in four boxes in the former Wiesbaden home of two of his Opel colleagues, who followed him to VW. On the afternoon of February 4, a call was made from his office near Frankfurt to Wolfsburg, the VW headquarters. Whom he called is not clear, but according to an extract from his office diary for that day, reproduced in today's edition of the news magazine Der Spiegel, Mr Lopez had noted: '14pm Jens Neu'. The magazine suggested this could have referred to a meeting with Mr Jens Neumann, the VW director responsible for group strategy. However, the distances involved suggest a meeting was unlikely. The next day, when Mr Lopez was to attend talks in Zurich at GM Europe, he cancelled all appointments and turned up unexpectedly at Eisenach in eastern Germany, Opel's newest car factory, and asked for documents on the plant's lean production systems. On February 6, he called Wolfsburg again. Public prosecutors investigating GM's suspicions of espionage last week stated that transparencies also found in the boxes, and regarded as confidential by GM, had also been expressly requested and translated into German by Mr Lopez. Der Spiegel, which last week was freed from a reporting gag on the case imposed through a temporary injunction granted to VW last month, yesterday quoted a senior VW employee as saying the prosecutors' statement sparked 'blind panic' in Wolfsburg. It also claimed an eye-witness had seen Mr Lopez's associates, Mr Jorge Alvarez Aguirre, and Mr Rosario Piazza, using two shredding machines in the house. Asked what they were doing, Mr Alvarez is said to have replied: 'We are destroying some General Motors documents.' The shredding took place after the two had quit Opel.

0,FT931-3507 ,"FT931-3507 _AN-DCPCCACUFT 930316   FT  16 MAR 93 / General Motors says Lopez finally decides to leave      By MARTIN DICKSON and CHRISTOPHER PARKES      NEW YORK, FRANKFURT   GENERAL Motors announced yesterday that Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, its head of worldwide purchasing, had finally decided to quit GM, apparently to join Germany's Volkswagen, after a bizarre five days of wavering between the two companies. Mr Lopez, one of the best-known figures in the US motor industry, appeared to have decided over the weekend to remain at GM. The US company even scheduled a press conference yesterday afternoon to announce this and to say he had been promoted to executive vice-president of the company and president of its North American automotive operations. However, Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, told the news conference that a friend of Mr Lopez had submitted a letter of resignation from him at lunchtime yesterday. The letter offered no explanation for his move. Mr Smith added: 'It is not clear to me what his intentions are or where he is at the present time.' However, he guessed that Mr Lopez would be joining Volkswagen with whom he signed a contract of employment last week. Volkswagen seems likely to announce that Mr Lopez is joining the company after a meeting today of its supervisory board, which is expected to approve a management shake-up. The news could also boost Volkswagen shares, which fell DM7.30 to DM285.50 yesterday when the German company appeared to have failed in its efforts to poach Mr Lopez. GM's failure to keep Mr Lopez is a blow to its efforts to slash its car manufacturing costs in North America, where the company has lost Dollars 12bn (Pounds 8.4bn) over the past two years. Mr Lopez led a team which demanded big price cuts from parts manufacturers and offered them workshops to improve their manufacturing techniques. The reasons for his vacillation and ultimate departure from GM remained unclear yesterday, though several factors appeared to have played a role. GM acknowledged that it had sought to keep him last Thursday by offering him the promotions which were to be announced today. In spite of these new positions, which would have given him substantial power over all North American manufacturing operations, Mr Lopez initially decided to join Volkswagen. He appeared to change his mind after meetings with members of his purchasing staff and further weekend discussions with Mr Smith. Mr Lopez had not asked for anything, but had been weighing up personal considerations. Mr Smith said Mr Lopez had told him at one point that his family wished to return to Europe and he had a contract with Volkswagen. The GM chief executive acknowledged that Mr Lopez, who hails from Spain's Basque country, had been urging the construction of a plant there using manufacturing techniques, capable of assembling a car in only 10 hours. However, GM had decided not to go ahead with such a project at the present time. Whirlwind, Page 20   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT933-2901 ,"FT933-2901 _AN-DIPCOAEMFT 930916   FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Rover set to make profit after two years of losses - British Aerospace interim results      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   ROVER Group, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, would be in profit for the full year in 1993 after two years of losses, Mr George Simpson, Rover chairman and BAe deputy chief executive said yesterday. In the first six months, Rover cut operating loss before interest from Pounds 31m to Pounds 19m. The loss included redundancy and restructuring costs of Pounds 22m. Excluding the one-off rationalisation charge, Rover's trading performance in the first half improved by Pounds 34m and resulted in a small profit of Pounds 3m. Rover expected 'a significant recovery' in its financial performance in the second half of the year, said Mr Simpson. Production, which fell by 6.4 per cent to 200,872 in the first half under the impact of significant stock reductions, was expected to rise in the second half of the year. At the same time, the benefits from last year's devaluation of sterling, which were delayed by currency hedging arrangements, would be fully reflected in the second half. The UK car maker's first half performance was impaired by launch costs of around Pounds 10m for the new Rover 600 executive car, which was introduced in April. In the second half, Rover would benefit from strong UK sales in August, when its registrations grew by 23.7 per cent in an overall market, which rose by 17.8 per cent. Rover turnover rose by 20.1 per cent in the first half to Pounds 1.98bn (Pounds 1.65bn). The group has increased its market share in the UK in the first eight months of the year to 13 per cent from 12.3 per cent in the corresponding period last year, and profitability is being helped by an improving 'model mix' with an increasing proportion of sales coming from its larger Rover cars and four-wheel drive Land Rover vehicles. Rover is also performing strongly in continental European markets, albeit from a small base, despite the steep decline in overall European new car sales. In the first six months, Rover and Land Rover worldwide vehicle sales increased by 13 per cent to 202,100. UK sales rose by 14 per cent to 119,700, while sales in continental Europe rose by 5 per cent to 65,500. Total sales outside the UK gained 12 per cent to 82,400. Rover eliminated 1,740 UK jobs in the period with a reduction in the workforce to 31,398 at the end of June. The UK workforce has been cut sharply from 40,500 at the end of 1990. Land Rover however, added 300 jobs during the summer in order to increase output of its successful Discovery range, and Mr Simpson ruled out further job cuts in the second half of the year.

HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer      Ordinarily, a state legislative candidate who receives only 10% of the  potential vote would not need to concern himself with housing prices in  Sacramento.    However, under the peculiar political mathematics governing next month's  special 76th Assembly District election, attracting the votes of as few as one  in 10 registered voters could insure a landslide victory in the race to select  a successor to the late Bill Bradley (R-Escondido).    Perhaps even more surprising than that unusually low electoral threshold is the  fact that most of the nine candidates in the Aug. 8 campaign doubt that anyone  will surpass it in the sprawling district, which stretches from northeastern  San Diego County to the South Bay, and also includes parts of Riverside County.    ""This is one time when there may be more candidates than voters,"" joked  Democrat Stephen Thorne.    The public's tepid attitude toward the contest obscures the fact that Bradley's  death last month after a nearly four-year battle with cancer created a rare  opportunity for a wide open Assembly race in San Diego County, where most  legislative districts' lopsided partisan voter registration and incumbents'  longevity historically discourage serious competition.    Registration within the 76th District itself is heavily slanted toward  Republicans, 54% to 33% -- a daunting disparity that could leave the  all-but-certain GOP victor with a seat viewed so safe as to be a lifetime job.    Although that tantalizing prospect has piqued uncommonly strong interest among  Bradley's would-be successors, as evidenced by the size of the field, there is  little indication that the public shares that sentiment. Special elections  typically draw low turnouts, a trend likely to be exacerbated in this race by a  mid-summer primary in a district that encompasses desert communities where  daily temperatures often are higher than the number of voters in many  precincts.    Indeed, as the two-month campaign enters its final three weeks, the consensus  of the candidates and their consultants is that next month's turnout probably  will be only about 20%, with some forecasting a turnout percentage as low as  the mid-teens.    To win election outright in the primary, a candidate must receive more than 50%  of the vote -- a figure that, based on the 20% projection, equates to only  about 10% of the district's approximately 240,000 voters.    If no candidate achieves that 50%-plus margin in the primary -- in which all  contenders of all parties will appear on a single ballot -- the top Republican  and Democratic vote-getters would compete in an Oct. 3 runoff. (Ten candidates  have qualified for the primary, but one -- Republican Lori Holt Pfeiler --  withdrew last week and endorsed fellow Republican Tricia Hunter. Pfeiler's  name, however, remains on the ballot.)    The campaign's unusual format, combined with its brevity and large field, has  complicated the candidates' efforts to devise an effective strategy for  reaching voters from Bonita to Palomar and Jacumba to Palm Desert in a shorter  time than candidates usually take to decide whether to run.    ""In terms of the time span, the circumstances, the number of candidates and  everything else, this is a once-in-a-lifetime campaign,"" said Republican Poway  City Councilwoman Linda Brannon, one of seven GOP candidates in the race. ""Just  about everything about it is unique.""    ""This is a blink-your-eye-and-it's-over kind of campaign,"" added Glenn  Richardson, another GOP candidate.    Despite its short duration, the campaign likely will end up being more  expensive than most full-length Assembly contests -- again, largely because of  the rarity of an ""open"" seat race. With three major candidates planning to  spend at least $150,000 each, the price tag for the primary alone is expected  to approach $1 million.    Recognizing the numerical possibilities of an exceptionally low turnout being  splintered among nine people, the candidates and their strategists acknowledge  that even seemingly minor first-time candidates could play a pivotal role in  next month's primary. By siphoning off critical votes from the front runners,  the long shots could scramble the vote breakdowns, conceivably allowing one of  the lesser-known candidates to slip into the runoff.    That potential is of gravest concern to the three candidates who appear to be  running the most well-rounded, well-funded campaigns: Brannon, Poway  businessman Dick Lyles and Bonita nurse Tricia Hunter. Each has assembled a  sizable grass roots organization, is well on the way to a six-figure campaign  budget, appears polished in front of campaign audiences and can point to  significant backing and endorsements.    A second tier of strong challengers, each of whom hopes to spend about  $100,000, includes San Diego Police Lt. Bill Hoover of Escondido, state Senate  legislative aide Dennis Koolhaas of Escondido and Richardson, a former  television commentator from Rancho.    The district's demographics alone appear to diminish the chances of the two  Democrats in the race -- Jeannine Correia, an instructor of the retarded from  Poway, and mental health worker Stephen Thorne of Escondido. Meanwhile, retired  appliance-store owner Ray Foster of Spring Valley summed up the long odds that  he confronts in his low-budget campaign this way: ""I'm out to answer the  question: 'Can a guy make his initial political run after age 65 and be  successful?' ""    In this case, the answer appears to be: Not likely.    However, as Correia points out, because of the peculiar nature of the 76th  District contest, ""no one can be automatically counted out."" As a result, most  of the candidates are able to offer winning scenarios that, while still  implausible, cannot be dismissed quite as lightly as they normally would be.    The Democrats' admittedly slim chances, for example, hinge on hopes that a  solid Democratic turnout could swamp a light, splintered GOP vote. Other  candidates talk of attracting specific blocs of voters while their opponents  neutralize each other. Republicans and Democrats alike are placing a strong  emphasis on absentee ballots, viewing that as a surer source of votes than  Election Day polling places.    Similarly, as the only Riverside County candidate in the race, Richardson is  particularly intrigued by the race's potential arithmetic possibilities.    ""San Diego has (about 70%) of the vote and eight candidates, and Riverside has  (30%) and one candidate,"" Richardson noted. ""Interesting math. Very interesting  math.""    Candidates' biographies.

By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Avalon city officials and business owners, arguing that Santa Catalina Island's  air is pristine and does not contribute to pollution in the Los Angeles Basin,  want out of the South Coast Air Quality Management District.    In a letter presented to an AQMD official last week, Catalina Chamber of  Commerce President George A.

The island's business community, he wrote, ""simply fails to understand its  contribution to the air quality problems of the Los Angeles Basin or the  inclusion of Catalina Island in the South Coast Air Quality Management  District.""    The letter asks that AQMD boundaries be redrawn to exclude the largely  undeveloped, 76-square-mile island from the district.    City officials say that although the smog district's geographic boundaries are  drawn along county lines, Catalina could become part of another, less-urban  district, or the island's unique location could be considered when permit fees  for smog-emitting equipment are levied. As a third alternative, they suggested  forming a new Channel Islands air quality district outside the 41 existing  districts.    ""We've got 22 miles of open water between us and the balance of the district,  and we don't see that we're in the same air basin,"" City Manager Chuck Prince  said.    The movement was sparked by recent visits to several island businesses by AQMD  officials, who have begun notifying small businesses countywide of new permit  fees and requirements for certain kinds of equipment.    Much of the increased attention on the island results from the district having  redrawn -- in late 1988 -- its list of equipment for which permits are needed.  Claudia Keith, an AQMD spokeswoman, said a lot of equipment that previously did  not require permits was added to the list, including restaurant broilers,  bakery ovens and cleaning equipment at dry-cleaning stores.    In Avalon, an AQMD inspector notified owners at more than half a dozen  businesses with such equipment that they would have to get permits and pay  fees.

0,FT933-5104 ,"FT933-5104 _AN-DIFB9AAFFT 930906   FT  06 SEP 93 / VW starts inquiry into surging loss at Seat subsidiary      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   MR Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, has ordered an examination of the books at Seat, following a rapid and unexpected surge in losses at the German car group's Spanish subsidiary. He is believed to have commissioned a special audit after receiving reports of a looming deficit at Seat this year of DM800m (Pounds 320m) or more, and requests for an urgent DM1bn cash injection to save the company from collapse. The subsidiary, which was taken over in 1986 and operates some of the most modern and low-cost manufacturing sites in the group, lost DM180m last year on sales of DM10bn. The need for an investigation adds to the burdens of Mr Piech, who is already weighed down by a bitter clash with General Motors of the US over allegations of industrial espionage. At the same time, he is battling to restore his personal credibility after having had to back away from earlier promises that the struggling VW automotive group would return to profit this year. Mr Piech, VW chairman since January 1, last Friday took on extra responsibilities - for auditing and government relations - after discussions with the group's supervisory board on measures to save Seat. No rescue decisions were taken, and a statement issued after the sitting referred only to 'cause for concern' at Seat and in North American and Asian-Pacific markets. Whatever the findings of the audit, which will be reported directly to Mr Piech, VW appears to have little alternative but to step in with a salvage operation which could wreck the chairman's hopes of a successful first financial year at the group. VW lost DM1.6bn in the first half, although the supervisory board said on Friday that it expected a positive result in the third quarter for the German parent and the group as a whole. The most likely source of cash for Seat is an intra-group transfer of DM1bn in return for which the parent would take control of the Spanish subsidiary's Pamplona plant, currently used to manufacture VW-marque Polo cars. The sale had already been planned and now it seemed advisable to bring it forward, Seat said at the weekend. The company blamed its troubles on the motor industry slump and the devaluation of the peseta, which had pushed up the cost of imported parts. It made no reference to the relative advantages for selling prices of the peseta's loss of value. In the first half of this year, while VW group vehicle production fell 19 per cent, output of Seat cars tumbled 34 per cent. VW has invested more than DM4bn in its Spanish business in the past two years, spending mainly on a new lean production factory at Martorell, and updating other sites. Pamplona has also been fully upgraded. In July, Seat scrapped a joint venture with Suzuki of Japan to build 150,000 mini-cars a year in Barcelona.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

It said that trading in the first 11 weeks of the current year was 'satisfactory', with like for like sales growth - which excludes store openings and closures - ahead of the 3.6 per cent achieved in the second half. The dividend was raised for the first time in 18 months. The shares, however, closed down 8 1/2 p at 123p. Analysts said brokers had been profit-taking after the shares had risen sharply in recent weeks. 'There is a good story here,' said Mr Nick Hawkins, retail analyst at Kleinwort Benson. 'They are making progress across all the divisions.' Last year's loss was after Pounds 106.8m of exceptional items, while this year's profit was boosted by Pounds 13.9m of profits on the sale of Sears investment in Aspreys, the jewellers, and the realisation of its investment in Satellite Information Services. But underlying trading profits increased 23 per cent from Pounds 100.5m to Pounds 123.6m. Group turnover increased 3.8 per cent from Pounds 1.93bn to Pounds 2.01bn, while the net margin was lifted from 5.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent. Mr Liam Strong, chief executive, said reshaping of the group was largely complete and efforts would be channelled into improving efficiency, boosting sales densities and reducing markdowns to drive net margins higher. The footwear division recovered from a Pounds 14.4m loss to a profit of Pounds 33.7m. Like-for-like sales increased 2.9 per cent, although total sales fell from Pounds 552.2m to Pounds 547.4m after the group closed 88 stores. In the high street fashion division, which includes the childrenswear, sports and leisurewear and womenswear businesses, trading profits improved only slightly from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 30.7m, although sales increased from Pounds 570.2m to Pounds 660.7m. Like-for-like sales fell 3.5 per cent in childrenswear reflecting strong competition, but in the sports and leisurewear business, which includes Milletts, the Olympus high street and Olympus Sportsworld chains, like-for-like sales increased 3.3 per cent.

0,FT931-507 ,"FT931-507 _AN-DC3CGAB0FT 930330   FT  30 MAR 93 / Rover joint venture aims to revive MG      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   ROVER, the motor vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, is in advanced negotiations to form a co-operative venture for the production of a new range of MG sports cars. It hopes to resurrect one of the world's best-known sports-car marques with the help of external finance, more than a decade after MG was killed off. Rover is negotiating with Mayflower, the specialist UK engineering company, to form a collaborative production venture for the new MG range. Code-named PR3, the sports car would be a small, affordable mid-engined roadster that could be ready for launch by 1995-96. The company cleared the way in the autumn last for a revival of the MG marque when it unveiled its low-volume MG RV8, a redesigned and more powerful variant of the MGB sports car last produced in 1980. The PR3 is designed to return MG to mainstream sports carmaking, a market dominated in recent years by Japanese carmakers with products such as the Mazda MX-5, following the earlier demise of UK sportscar makes such as Triumph and MG. Rover, formerly the loss-making state-owned British Leyland, abandoned this market in 1980 with the closure of the MG plant at Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Under the terms of the proposed collaboration with Mayflower, Motor Panels, the Coventry-based supplier of automotive bodies and a subsidiary of Mayflower since 1991, would produce the MG body panels and supply the welded bodies to Rover for painting and final assembly. Mayflower, due to announce today its preliminary financial results for 1992, is also expected to launch a new share issue aimed in part at financing the planned venture with Rover. A revival of the distinctive MG marque has long been planned by Rover, but the UK carmaker has lacked the funds to finance the venture alone in the face of the heavy capital demands of its mainstream new model programmes. In less than four years Rover has renewed most of its product range starting with the launch of the 200/400 series, the Land Rover Discovery and a re-engineered Metro in 1989 and 1990, followed by a revamped Rover 800 in 1991 and the imminent launch of the Rover 600 next month. The attraction of the venture for Rover is that Mayflower would take over responsibility for financing a costly part of the new MG development programme, namely the development of the tooling and equipment for producing the body panels and for welding the bodies. Mayflower already produces the exterior panels for the Land Rover Discovery and cabs for the Leyland Daf 45 series light trucks. The Pounds 26,500 MG RV8 was developed to mark the 30th anniversary of the MGB, of which more than 500,000 were built. The RV8 will be produced at a maximum volume of only 15 a week with first delivery starting next month, but the model is intended to resurrect the MG name in public awareness.

This predicted increase of car ownership and production in China will clearly have enormous implications for the automotive sector internationally. The study, by a group within the Chinese bureaucracy called the Strategic Development Research Team of China's Family Car, forecast that by 2010 China will build 3.5m cars a year, with two-thirds of them being sold to private motorists. Total production value of the automotive sector will reach Yn420bn (Pounds 31.6bn) a year, with an extra Yn1,052bn being generated by associated industries. The study estimated the automotive sector would be generating Yn80bn annually in tax revenue by 2010 and would have created 15m new jobs. 'Having a family car will signal that a Chinese citizen's life has turned from a moderately well-to-do to a rich one,' the study reported. Publication this week in the Economic Daily of the study coincides with a debate within the Chinese bureaucracy about the desirability of increased private car ownership. Mr He Guangyuan, minister of machinery industry warned this week against the danger of 'old attitudes' to car ownership hindering development. 'If we can't see how necessary it is for car-ownership to become widespread and don't actively support a private car market, it would be hard for car-making to become a pillar industry,' he told the China Business Times newspaper. Rapid development of the automotive sector is meeting opposition from bureaucrats who see car ownership as bourgeois. Sections of government fear China's infrastructure would be unable to cope with so many cars on an over-taxed road system. China recently unveiled a new car industry policy that envisages the establishment of three or four car manufacturing conglomerates by 2000, engaged in the mass production of family sedans. The policy instituted a freeze on new manufacturers entering China until 1996 to enable present operators to build up strength. Volkswagen, in partnership with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, is China's biggest maker of passenger cars. In 1993 it built 100,000 Santanas, a medium-sized family car, out of a total of 234,000 sedans made throughout China, which plans to be producing 1.35m passenger cars a year by 2000, with 90 per cent of the market supplied from local production. Output would rise to 3.5m-4m units by the year 2010. From 1979 to 1993 the number of cars in China grew from 150,000 to 1.4m, of which 50,000 are privately owned. Cars owned by individuals or families will amount to about 20 per cent of total cars on the road in China in 2000. Percentages of individual car ownership would rise to 40 per cent in 2005 and 60 per cent in 2010.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P3711 Motor Vehicles and Car Bodies.

0,FT931-14461 ,"FT931-14461 _AN-DASCGAAOFT 930119   FT  19 JAN 93 / German politicians warn of budget cuts      By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID MARSH      BONN   THE SLOWDOWN in the German economy will mean an 'inevitable' increase in the government's net borrowing requirement, as well as drastic savings through cuts in tax allowances and reduced social spending, members of the ruling coalition warned yesterday. They hope to finalise plans for a substantial savings package, as part of the wider negotiations for a 'solidarity pact' to finance German unification, in top-level talks today. It is expected to include the introduction of strict means tests to limit social payments, such as children's allowances, to the poorest, and a possible halving in the tax benefits available for home-buyers. It will also attempt to limit the payment of unemployment benefit, to ensure that the dole does not exceed wages available for those still in work. The possibility of substantial cuts in social payments has aroused the anger of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). If the package is rejected by the SPD, the government will still press ahead and attempt to reach broad agreement with the trade unions and the governments of the 16 federal Lander, according to leaders of the coalition. Both Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrats (FDP), the minority party in the coalition, and Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), took a hard line on the negotiations yesterday. Mr Lambsdorff said that there was a forecast shortfall in tax revenues for the 1993 budget of DM5bn (Pounds 2bn), and an increased subsidy of a further DM5bn needed for the Federal Labour Office - which pays unemployment benefit  -as a result of the economic downturn. A further DM1.5bn had been promised to Russia, partly for the accelerated withdrawal of troops from eastern Germany, DM1.5bn for reintroduction of investment allowances in east Germany, and DM4bn as direct federal subsidies for the eastern Lander. That would make a total shortfall of some DM17bn, and Mr Lambsdorff said the coalition partners 'still have to find another DM2bn or DM3bn'. Mr Waigel said in Munich that social payments, including allowances for children and new infants, would be subjected to stricter means testing, as one way of cutting the budget burden in a socially balanced way - to meet the demands of the SPD. However, both he and Mr Lambsdorff said that the coalition would press ahead with the savings package, even if the SPD does not agree. Foreign companies seeking to invest in east Germany widely believe they suffer discrimination compared with indigenous groups, according to a report* published today, writes David Marsh. The report, from the Anglo-German Foundation for the Study of Industrial Society, says foreign companies can overcome this handicap by emphasising the competitive advantages of foreign investment in the east. Foreign companies have made up about 10 per cent of investment channeled to east German through privatisation of state industry holdings since reunification. *British investment in a united Germany.

0,FT931-5912 ,"FT931-5912 _AN-DCDB5AAKFT 930304   FT  04 MAR 93 / Walkout at Ford after leak of plans to cut 3,000 jobs      By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent   LEAKED internal documents from Ford Motor Company revealing plans to close most of its general services business yesterday led to a walkout at its Dagenham plant. According to the documents, leaked by unions at the company, Ford intends to contract out most of its general services business in a move affecting 3,000 jobs in its British and German plants by the end of the year, in spite of the risk of industrial conflict. Service workers at Dagenham staged an unofficial 24-hour strike in protest and union officials said they were shocked and horrified at the proposals. The workers involved are employed in the transport of supplies and parts between Ford plants in the UK and continental Europe as well as maintenance work, electrical engineering and office administration. The company employs 1,482 service workers in the UK and as many as 1,317 of them would be affected by the restructuring plan. The company says there will be no compulsory redundancies. Ford confirmed the leaked documents were genuine, and said it was studying how to implement the contracting-out plan, but the outcome could not be prejudged. It added that it was company policy to use outside specialist companies where appropriate. Last year, Ford said it was outsourcing its seat manufacture. Ford said it needed to cut its costs and could not afford to retain in-house services when these could be provided more competitively from outside. In the leaked documents, Ford assesses the strike risks of going ahead with restructuring general services. It believes 'the most serious risks' lie with the truck drivers who supply key components to its production plants. 'A British truck fleet dispute would probably result in the progressive closure of all Ford European manufacturing plants within three days,' the documents say. The company calculates that if it decided to reassign or re-source truck fleet business, it would 'result in a dispute of at least two weeks' duration' because it would mean a loss of earnings and jobs. The documents say Ford believes the unions would be 'unlikely to act swiftly to influence the drivers to end a truck fleet dispute'. Another danger area for disruption would be boiler operations, where a strike could halt production quickly, although Ford believes the personnel concerned 'would be willing to explore re-sourcing and reassignment terms before reacting'. Ford has calculated that it would not be possible to stockpile to protect continental manufacturing plants because of the limited time available. It also believes there would be 'major difficulties' for management in maintaining boiler operations. The documents also suggest the company fears a 'a high risk of significant disruption' across all general services. Union officials are due to meet Ford on March 11 to discuss the company's existing threat of compulsory redundancies in its UK plants.

Without discussion, the board, with Supervisor Kenneth Hahn absent, voted  unanimously to end its relationship with the Van Nuys branch of Driver Safety  Schools, effective Oct. 12. Meanwhile, the county and other agencies, including  police, are investigating operations at the company's six other branches, which  also have county contracts.    County officials have been referring the 800 people enrolled in the Van Nuys  school to other court-ordered programs. Officials had stopped new referrals to  Driver Safety School's six other sites until the review is completed.

A report to the supervisors by the county Department of Health Services  recommended ending the contract but gave no reason for doing so. The director  of the county's Office of Alcohol Programs declined to comment on why the  contract was canceled.    However, a July 16 accident involving a former Driver Safety Schools student  has sparked an investigation of the school by the county, the Los Angeles  Police Department, the state Department of Motor Vehicles and the California  Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs.    Two people were killed in that crash, which occurred three days after the  driver, Harry Bouboushian, received a certificate from Driver Safety Schools  showing that he had completed a one-year treatment program that he entered  after a previous drunk-driving conviction.    Bouboushian, 34, of Los Angeles, was charged with murder and felony drunk  driving. A preliminary hearing was set for Oct. 2.    Los Angeles police said the school's records indicate that Bouboushian was  given the certificate before he completed the program. Detective Richard Levos  of the department's bunco forgery division said he is trying to determine  whether there were other irregularities at the school.    Barbara Bloomberg, a member of the county's Commission on Alcoholism, said at  least two students told county officials, in letters or sworn statements, that  school employees offered to provide certificates as long as the program fees  were paid -- regardless of whether the students attended the required sessions.      Certificate for $1,000    One student said he was offered a completion certificate for $1,000, she said.    The owner of Driver Safety Schools, Arnold Abrams, could not be reached for  comment Tuesday.    His attorney, Morse A. Taylor, declined to comment. However, Taylor previously  acknowledged that Bouboushian received his certificate three weeks early but  said Bouboushian completed all the necessary work. Taylor said that a school  counselor sold a certificate for about $300 to a client who never attended the  program, but that Abrams fired the employee when he learned of the incident.    Al Wright, director of the county's Office of Alcohol Programs, said his office  is continuing its investigation into the six other sites operated by Driver  Safety Schools. But he declined comment on Tuesday's action or the reasons  behind it.    The Bouboushian incident moved the Board of Supervisors to establish a panel  last month to improve supervision of more than 130 similar drunk-driving  programs countywide.

0,FT933-16784 ,"FT933-16784 _AN-DGBCVAAKFT 930702   FT  02 JUL 93 / Euro car price list seen as Brussels victory      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   THE first mandatory pan-European new car price lists published yesterday at the order of the European Commission show variations between countries of up to 30 per cent. But most fall between the EC's own 12-18 per cent guidelines and the Commission itself refrained from the harsh criciticism which parts of the European industry had been fearing. Under the terms of an agreement made with the Commission last year, Europe's car makers and importers are required to publish price lists twice a year. This followsfierce complaints from consumer organisations in Brussels and in the UK claiming that price divergences are big enough and persistent enough to breach EC regulations. The lists released yesterday take the form of an index related to the prices of 55 European and 17 Japanese top-selling models on May 1 this year, based on recommended retail prices, adjusted for equipment differences and converted to Ecus. Among small cars, variations of up to 24 per cent were found - in the case of Fiat's Cincequento - between the most expensive market, France, and the cheapest, Spain. In the large saloon category, Ford's new Mondeo 1.6LX saloon was found to be 23.9 per cent more expensive in Germany than in the cheapest markets, Italy and Ireland. At the executive car level BMW's biggest variation was of 22 per cent, in the case of its 730i V8 model, in France, with the UK being the cheapest. The Commission, which hopes the information will help motorists to shop around in the EC for best buys, acknowledged that exchange rate fluctuations have played a large part in the variations. It added it would be wrong to arrive at 'far-reaching conclusions' about manufacturers' commercial policies from the price comparisons. But it said the next report in November would enable the Commission to assess the trend in price differentials, which it expects to diminish. Last night the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, which has persistently claimed the variations are largely outside the industry's control, said the Commission's statement showed that exchange rate fluctuations and widely varying taxation regimes were largely to blame for the discrepancies and that these would have to continue until EC economies themselves converged. The issue is of profound importance to car makers and their dealers because in 1995 the present 10-year 'block exemption' which allows them to operate a selective distribution system - in contravention of EC competition rules - is due to expire. The EC competition directorate has warned that a renewal of the block exemption will depend heavily on car prices staying broadly within the EC's guidelines for price differentials. These state that prices should not differ between EC member states by more than 12 per cent in the long-term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year.

Under the program, launched May 10 and carried out intermittently since then,  officers have impounded vehicles with five or more unpaid parking tickets. By  the end of last week, officers had towed 55 vehicles, collecting fines on about  500 tickets when the owners claimed the vehicles, said Sgt. Donald MacNeil, a  police traffic administration supervisor.    MacNeil said officers used a computer to identify scofflaws -- drivers who  repeatedly violate parking rules -- then sent a special team to find the  offenders' vehicles and arrange a tow.    ""It is a research-based, computer-aided task force,"" he said.    The crackdown is expected to continue over the next three to six months, as  officers whittle down their list of scofflaws.    Parking problems, aggravated by the city's population boom, have become a key  complaint of Glendale residents.    City officials spent more than a year debating a proposal to restrict overnight  parking as one way to relieve curbside congestion. In the wake of strong  community opposition, the Glendale City Council last month abandoned the  overnight parking ban but urged increased enforcement of existing laws.    ""We have seen that as sort of a mission or goal statement for the traffic  division,"" MacNeil said.    The city's 11 traffic enforcement officers ticket motorists who ignore  street-sweeping signs, fail to pay parking meters or stay too long in a space  with a parking time limit. Violations occur in both residential and commercial  areas, MacNeil said.    The new crackdown is aimed at drivers who simply toss their tickets on the  floor or stuff them into the glove box.    The state Department of Motor Vehicles will not allow motorists to renew their  car's registration until all parking tickets are paid. If the tickets remain  unpaid, police may summon a tow truck because the vehicle lacks current  registration.    But MacNeil said the system is flawed because unpaid tickets take many months  to work their way through the courts and state vehicle offices before a  registration renewal is blocked.    Glendale police opted to use a state law that allows them to tow a vehicle  immediately if it has collected five or more tickets over at least five days.  Officers reviewed computer lists of repeat offenders and pinpointed the  neighborhoods where the violations most often occurred.    During early morning hours, members of the task force converged on these areas  to find the offenders' cars and called for tow trucks.    Some motorists had to dig deep into their wallets to get their cars back. For  most overdue Glendale parking tickets, the charge is $42 -- double the normal  fee. Fines for parking in a handicapped space are significantly higher.    The owner also must pay a $56 towing fee, plus $9.50 per day for storage if the  vehicle is not claimed within two hours.    Many of those who have been towed in the new crackdown have paid the penalties  without much protest, said Carvel Gay, owner of one of the three Glendale firms  that have police towing contracts.

Nothing had yet been proved and nothing had been decided, said the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) yesterday. However, it commented, Tuesday's ruling by a Hamburg civil court that Der Spiegel, the news weekly, could continue reporting on the most damaging allegations, had 'cast a clear shadow' over VW. The suspicions were still only suspicions, but they were gaining weight, according to the FAZ said. The paper noted recent remarks by Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the VW supervisory board, that the affair was a campaign by Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, which damaged the whole automobile industry. However, it said: 'Above all it is damaging VW during a delicate restructuring phase.' The need for explanations was increasing. 'If the suspicions harden, then the situation will become especially tight for (VW) chairman Ferdinand Piech, who is linked for better or worse with Lopez.' Tuesday's court ruling indicated that the judge set more store on affidavits and testimony from GM employees than on statements from Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's new production director, and Mr Piech. The weekly Die Zeit newspaper was more direct. It asked if Mr Lopez could be taken seriously when he spoke with a 'forked tongue' over a mooted car factory in his Basque homeland. His accounts varied depending on whether he was speaking in Spain or Germany, Die Zeit said. If the allegations hardened that Mr Lopez had stolen secret GM documents, the VW supervisory board would have no choice but to fire him immediately, the paper added. If that did not take VW's name out of the headlines: 'Then it will be a matter of the head of Piech, who is not good at acting as though he knows nothing.' Until yesterday the quality press, apart from Der Spiegel which has printed dozens of allegations against Mr Lopez and his associates, had reported developments in the affair in dead-pan fashion, in barest detail, and virtually without comment, apart from the occasional use of the word 'unique'. 'The dimensions of the case are not conceivable to them (editors),' explained one German observer. 'They cannot imagine that a company at the top of German industry could be involved in such an affair.' At the same time, there was a general feeling that Germany had enough economic and unemployment problems without the press undermining or damaging a company as important as Volkswagen, he added. Yesterday even Bild Zeitung, the mass circulation daily, which has in the past concentrated mainly on the curiosity value of Mr Lopez, his eating habits and management methods, reflected the changed mood. 'Is Lopez on the way out?' asked the headline on its front-page report on the Der Spiegel ruling.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     General Motors Corp.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT931-92 ,"FT931-92 _AN-DC4CXAF7FT 930331   FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz blazes a trail in US - David Waller on the group's plans to obtain a listing on the NYSE      By DAVID WALLER   OVER the past six weeks, Daimler-Benz and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have hammered out an agreement which is likely to have profound implications for some of the world's largest companies - and for the world's largest capital market. The agreement means that Daimler, Germany's biggest industrial company with sales approaching DM100bn (Dollars 61.4m) in 1992, will later this year become the first German company to obtain a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr Hung Tran, head of DB Research, the research arm of Deutsche Bank, said: 'The move will give (Daimler) direct access to the world's biggest capital pool - helping them to diversify their sources of capital at a time of increasing global competition for capital.' Mr Gerhard Liener, finance director of Daimler-Benz, said yesterday that the the company decided to 'go it alone' towards the end of last year. The move, he said, was a recognition that the company's shareholder base must be reoriented to reflect the growing internationalisation of the group's business. 'We were on the way to becoming a global company and I began to realise that I might have been caught in an anachronistic way of thinking,' Mr Liener said yesterday. 'Just as English has become the language of international business, Anglo-Saxon accounting has become the accounting language worldwide. I thought it was foolish to go on trying to play Don Quixote tilting at windmills.' He says he met with flexibility on the side of the SEC. 'A similar process of rethinking was underway there, too. They were afraid that (without European companies) that the New York market would fall back from being the world leader and become provincial.' Although Daimler made the bulk of the concessions in its negotiations with the SEC, the US agency displayed some flexibility of its own. It did not insist that Daimler provide a full US-style accounting of its earnings for the three years prior to 1992. Mr Richard Breeden, the SEC chairman, said yesterday that the agency had agreed 'that it was not necessary for the company to incur inordinate costs to develop every detail of information with respect to prior years' financial statements' as normally required under US accounting procedures. Mr Liener argues that much of the accounting adjustment will be relatively painless. Group accounts - rather than those prepared by the German holding company and four main operating units - already comply to a large extent with US accounting rules. The DM4bn released from 'hidden reserves' will not affect the group accounts and 'will not be used to pay dividends'. More detail will have to be given more often, he says. Goodwill of DM4bn on acquisitions will have to be written off against the profit and loss account, but as the amortisation period is likely to be 40 years, the impact will not be drastic.

The two companies announced that the new joint venture company would invest up to Rs6bn (Dollars 191m) in a manufacturing plant, expected to start production in 1997. The two partners would start the venture and decide the extent of equity for each company after a feasibility study. Volkswagen will be competing with several of the world's leading carmakers to establish a presence in India's newly liberalised passenger car market, which is estimated to double by the year 2000 to between 450,000 and 500,000 cars. These include General Motors, Chrysler, Ford, Peugeot, Daimler-Benz, Volvo, Hyundai, Mitsubishi and Daewoo. VW will also have to compete with the Indian Maruti, made in collaboration with Suzuki Motors of Japan, which has a dominant place in the Indian market. Mr Martin Posth, VW board member and chairman and president of Volkswagen Asia-Pacific, said that his company considered India one of the world's major emerging markets, especially since Asia is expected to account for most of the growth in the global vehicle market. Mr Posth said his company chose Eicher as a partner because of its widespread distribution network and professional management. Eicher manufactured India's first tractor in 1960 and entered into the light commercial vehicles sector in the 1980s, manufacturing small trucks and pick-up vans in collaboration with Mitsubishi Motor Corporation of Japan. Eicher has achieved a local content of over 90 per cent for these vehicles. Volkswagen is keen to maximise the level of local content, and hopes to capitalise on Eicher's experience in this area. Only then could their cars be competitive in the Indian market, Mr Posth said, indicating that his company would focus initially on medium-sized cars. Mr Vikram Lal, chairman of the Eicher group said that India offered the VW group the advantage of a diverse and cost-effective additional automobile base. Volkswagen will not restrict itself to a single model, but proposes to introduce a range of cars in India - though focusing initially on medium-sized cars - unlike several other global vehicle giants entering the market with a single car. Bharat Shell, a joint venture between the Indian government-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Shell Overseas Investment, is to construct a new lubricant blending unit at Uran, near Bombay, to manufacture Shell brand lubricants for the Indian market, writes Shiraz Sidhva. Mr Vikram Mehta, managing director of Bharat Shell, said yesterday that the company decided to set up its own unit because of capacity constraint at Bharat Petroleum's unit at Bombay, where the Shell range of lubricants are blended. The Rs1.3bn company, in which Shell has a 51 per cent stake, hopes to enter India's domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market, which the government has yet to privatise. Bharat Shell already manufactures LPG for industrial use for markets in western India and plans to enlarge the spread its network nationally.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Eicher Goodearth.

0,FT933-13059 ,"FT933-13059 _AN-DGUCEAD3FT 930721   FT  21 JUL 93 / VW suffers further setback in legal battle with GM      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN lost more ground in its legal battle with General Motors of the US when a Hamburg court yesterday permitted publication of further detailed allegations of industrial espionage by senior executives at the German motor group. Der Spiegel, the German news magazine, welcomed the partial lifting of a temporary injunction, imposed on it last month. It had claimed that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, now production and procurement director at VW, had 'not adhered strictly to the truth' over events surrounding his departure as a GM director earlier this year. VW admitted yesterday that the court had 'extensively' accepted the magazine's claimed right to report suspicions. But it quoted a statement last week from Mr Harald Ficus, the presiding judge, who told the open hearing that the court would not make any decisions on the truth or untruth of the suspicions. VW shares, which fell last Friday after the oral hearing, dropped DM6.8 to DM351 yesterday, although the ruling had not been made by the time the market closed. Traders said the fall was due to US selling by people speculating on the court's ruling. Although GM was not directly involved in the civil action, which was heard last Thursday and ruled on yesterday, the allegations published in the magazine are at the heart of a criminal investigation being undertaken by state prosecutors in the light of the US group's accusations. The court removed the gag preventing reporting of 11 mostly highly contentious issues. These include the claim central to GM's charges, reported by Der Spiegel, relating to the alleged removal by Mr Lopez and several former GM colleagues who followed him to VW of boxes of confidential GM price lists, secret construction plans and car model studies. VW responded to the court's findings by pointing out that the magazine remained gagged on several issues. The magazine was freed from reporting restrictions on claims, which 'give the impression or allow the impression to be drawn that Mr Lopez and colleagues who changed to VW with him took with them any secret GM or Opel (GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel) documents and delivered them to VW'. One key to the court's decision lay in evidence presented last week by Mr John Howell, director of business planning at GM Europe, who 'specifically remembered' giving Mr Lopez 100-150 documents the day before Mr Lopez announced his departure. The documents included details of new models, including a top secret mini, the O-Car. Mr Lopez told last week's hearing: 'I obtained at my request only documents concerning the rejected project (for a revolutionary low-cost production plant) on which I had worked on for a year and a half. As I remember it was a matter of four charts. These four charts are still in my office at GM.' GM says searches of offices vacated by Mr Lopez and colleagues have failed to find any of the secret documents which the US group claims they had before they left for Germany.

0,FT944-136 ,"FT944-136 _AN-FAAACABDFT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / Triumph of style over substance: John Griffiths on the craze for macho, gas-guzzling four-wheel drive vehicles      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   Next month's motor shows in Detroit and Los Angeles are expected to confirm a trend in car-buying that represents the triumph of ego over ecology, lust over logic, and cult over commonsense. The latest vehicle sales statistics from North America show that, in the first 11 months of this year, Americans bought 5.6m of what are described as light trucks - four-wheel drive cars such as the Jeep Cherokee and Range Rover, multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) that seat seven or eight adults with car-like handling, and pick-up trucks. These 'cult' sectors of the US market have accounted for 43 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales in 1994. 'It's been trucks, trucks, trucks - we can't build enough,' according to Mr John Maciarz, a spokesman for market leader General Motors. This year, more than any other, light truck sales have outperformed the conventional car market in the US by a large and growing margin. Sales are nearly 15 per cent higher than in the same period last year, compared with growth in car sales of just 5 per cent. In some western US states and provinces of Canada, their sales now outnumber those of ordinary cars. Indeed, the single best-selling vehicle in the US is not a car, but a pick-up: Ford's F-series model outsells the country's best selling car, the Ford Taurus, by a ratio of 3 to 2. For most of their owners for most of the time, these vehicles are not ideal choices: four-wheel drives and MPVs are usually much bigger than they need; pick-ups have few passenger seats; and all three are simply irrelevant to any kind of need other than the emotional. Most also consume far more fuel than anyone needs for basic transportation. US vehicle makers claim to be almost as nonplussed as environmentalists by the gulf between the public support for energy and environmental conservation and the purchase of eccentric gas-guzzlers. This year, Chrysler has taken the pick-up cult to a new extreme with the Dodge Ram Laramie SLT Magnum V10. Only three adults can squeeze into its cab; its rear load deck is open to the elements; and under its bonnet is an engine with 10 cylinders, eight litres and the ability to out-drag most sports cars. Such eccentricity is unlikely to remain confined to the land of Dollars 1-a-gallon gasolene, however. Chrysler's UK importer currently has one on test, assessing it for a possible niche in the European markets. Despite several attempts by manufacturers to promote them as both leisure and utility vehicles, pick-ups have never really caught on in Europe. In the UK, only slightly more than 3,000 are expected to be sold this year, almost all to builders and other traders. But four-wheel drive cars are another story. They have already provided the beachhead through which Chrysler is re-establishing itself as a manufacturer to be taken seriously in Europe, with sales of around 20,000 units a year of its Cherokee, Grand Cherokee and Wrangler models, some assembled at a plant in Austria. Last year, according to statistics from market monitoring group Automotive Industry Data, Europeans bought 300,000 leisure/utility four-wheel drives. AID forecasts that sales should rise to around 500,000 by the end of the decade. Japan's choked roads provide the best support available for those who contend that the European four-wheel drive market has a long way to grow. Although the Japanese have even fewer opportunities than Europeans to take their vehicles off-road, because of greater urban sprawl and tight controls on the countryside, four-wheel drives account for 6 per cent of the new car market. To date, their share in Europe is under 3 per cent. According to AID, buyers justify their purchases by a desire 'to venture off-road where the mountain goat tenacity of such vehicles is likely to be needed'. AID's report on European four-wheel drive prospects to the year 2002 says that those interviewed claimed other features, such as styling, were much less important. But the report's research into how these vehicles are used showed that most buyers had little or no need for an off-road capability. 'The overwhelming majority of vehicle owners, around 95 per cent, are using their four-wheel drives for nothing more demanding than driving to the office, or for the daily school run.' Embarrassed though most buyers might be to admit it, AID suggests, the real reason for their purchase is simply 'to stand out from the crowd'. To underline the point, it reports that four-wheel drive owners on average were found to spend nine times as much as their car-buying counterparts on appearance-improving extras. In terms of both purchase and running costs, four-wheel drives can be a very expensive way of being different. In September, the UK Rover Group's subsidiary, Land Rover, launched the latest version of its flagship Range Rover model, developed as part of a four-year, Pounds 300m investment programme. Priced at up to Pounds 44,000, it has taken the vehicles into direct competition with established luxury car producers such as Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, BMW and Lexus (Toyota). The Range Rover, its cheaper stablemate the Discovery and the more utilitarian Land Rover Defender have been big success stories in the world market for four-wheel drives. The company's output at the end of the 1980s was fewer than 50,000. This year the total will reach a record 85,000, and the company expects to sell 100,000 units or more in the new year. With so much at stake, Land Rover executives strongly defend their four-wheel drive vehicles, maintaining they offer more than an ego trip. The Discovery, they say, is gradually taking over the market for big estate cars, typified by Volvo, because of its commanding driving position above other traffic and multi-seat flexibility, as well as style and image. Critics maintain that the perception of usable space is exaggerated. They add that the current cult status of the vehicles could quickly be undermined if there is a revival in concerns over the stability of these cars, which have a high centre of gravity. Small Suzuki four-wheel drives faced a barrage of criticisms over rollover safety in the 1980s. More recently, the deaths of a woman and her two children in a motorway accident in the UK, when their Range Rover rolled over the central barrier into oncoming traffic, has revived industry unease over the safety image of four-wheel drive cars. Yet manufacturers continue to crowd into the sector, and the vehicles themselves grow ever more varied. Volvo is reported to have developed a four-wheel drive prototype; Ford may introduce its large Explorer model into Europe; and Korea's SSangyong will introduce its first four-wheel drive to Europe during 1995. Meanwhile, Japan's Mitsubishi has just launched a Japan-only, 600cc mini version of its popular Pajero/Shogun vehicle. Two of Europe's biggest carmakers, Peugeot and Fiat, stand out from the trend, however, as absentees from this sector of the market. Both Peugeot's chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, and Fiat Auto's director-general, Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, maintain that four-wheel drives will end up in a market wilderness and that the best growth prospects for niche vehicles lies with multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs). Their own efforts have gone into producing such a vehicle jointly, already in production as the Fiat Ulysse, Peugeot 806 and Citroen Synergie. But for 'green' critics of Europe's current modest craze for the fuel-gulping, macho-looking four-wheel drives, the future looks bleak. The latest vehicle sales statistics from North America suggest that, short of a public outcry over their safety, there will be many more of these vehicles on Europe's roads by the end of 1995.

0,FT933-7932 ,"FT933-7932 _AN-DHSCEAFFFT 930818   FT  18 AUG 93 / Rexrodt moves to defuse VW spying row with GM      By QUENTIN PEEL and CHRISTOPHER PARKES      BONN, FRANKFURT   MR GUNTER Rexrodt, the German economics minister, yesterday stepped into the bitter dispute between the motor giants Volkswagen and Adam Opel, General Motors' German subsidiary, apparently aiming to defuse the conflict. His intervention is a clear indication of concern at the highest levels of the German government over the damage done to the country's international reputation by the row over the alleged theft of industrial secrets. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as Mr Rexrodt himself, has already publicly urged the two sides to settle their differences. Mr Rexrodt invited Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, for talks at the economics ministry in Bonn last night and he has agreed on a similar meeting with Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, to be held on Friday. Both companies have agreed to the discussions. A ministry spokeswoman said Mr Rexrodt was not seeking to mediate directly in the dispute, in which GM has accused VW of industrial espionage and the theft of confidential docu-ments. 'He is merely seeking to inform himself about the situation, and about the arguments on both sides,' she said. The move was immediately welcomed by VW as a step towards peace talks between the two companies. They have been at loggerheads since Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former global purchasing director for GM, defected to VW in March. GM accused Mr Lopez and several associates of systematically plundering industrial secrets before their departure. There was less enthusiasm from senior officials at Opel, who insist that before the two companies can sit down together Mr Piech must withdraw what Opel sees as anti-American accusations against GM, and his suggestion that the US company was somehow responsible for planting its secret documents on VW employees. In a furious outburst last month, Mr Piech suggested GM was trying to damage VW in a commercially motivated war. This week he underscored his commitment to his production director, repeating that he would 'put my hand in the fire' for Mr Lopez. Opel officials added yesterday that the company would not enter peace talks while the German legal authorities were in the middle of an investigation into allegations of theft, industrial espionage and fraud. At VW, Mr Otto Wachs, a company spokesman, said the Rexrodt initiative was 'very much to be welcomed, because it supports us in our efforts to talk to each other. For two weeks we have been trying to initiate talks with Opel, but so far without success,' he said. Yesterday, Mr Georg Nauth, spokesman for the public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt, which is responsible for the investigation, expressed some doubt about VW's move to appoint independent assessors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand. He insisted his office was already in possession of more information than would be available to an independent investigator. 'An independent investigator cannot undertake searches, cannot confiscate documents, and cannot make inquiries at Opel,' he said.

0," LA060189-0089   64472    June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 2; Metro Desk      1257 words      TESTS FIND 'SILENT' AIDS INFECTIONS      By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer      New research suggests that the standard blood tests for AIDS fail to detect the  deadly human immunodeficiency virus in nearly one of every four ""high-risk"" gay  men who practice unsafe sex.    In the startling finding, UCLA researchers isolated the virus which causes AIDS  in 23% of a group of Los Angeles-area gay men who repeatedly tested negative  for the virus by standard tests.    Before the study, such ""silent"" HIV infections had been known to occur, but  were considered rare.    ""The results are very shocking,"" said David T. Imagawa, a professor of  pediatrics and microbiology-immunology at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in  Torrance and the principal author of the study in today's New England Journal  of Medicine. ""We expected, if anything, to find very few (antibody-negative  infected) individuals.""    Imagawa said the results re-emphasize the need for gay men, intravenous drug  users and others in AIDS risk groups to refrain from donating blood and to  practice safe sex -- even if they have tested negative for AIDS antibodies.  Regardless of antibody test results, blood banks currently try to screen out  and eliminate donations from those at risk of being infected.    The team of researchers from UCLA, Northwestern University Medical School in  Chicago and Cetus Corp. in Emeryville said they isolated the AIDS virus in 31  of a group of 133 gay men who had tested antibody-negative.      Dangerous Sexual Practices    The researchers sought gay men who they thought were likely to be infected,  despite negative antibody tests. Such men continued to engage in anal  intercourse with multiple partners and other dangerous sexual practices.    For this reason, the scientists cautioned that their findings could not be  generalized to others who have tested negative for AIDS antibodies, many of  whom are at lower risk of infection and may never have been exposed to the  virus in the first place.    ""This is a select group,"" Imagawa said. ""We cannot provide an estimate of the  proportion of (all) HIV infections that do not stimulate measurable  antibodies.""    Antibody molecules are proteins produced by the body's immune system to fight  foreign germs, such as the AIDS virus. AIDS antibodies are measured by standard  tests called the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ""Western blot.""    Antibodies are commonly detected in the blood within several months of HIV  infection. But previously a small number of infections had been recognized  where the delay was one to three years or more.    In a New England Journal of Medicine editorial also published today, William A.  Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston said the new data may  have ""encouraging"" as well as ""disquieting"" implications.    The ""good news"" is that the evidence that some infected men have not developed  antibodies may suggest they are somehow warding off the disease. The  replication of the AIDS virus ""may be spontaneously suppressed by a combination  of cellular, viral and immune mechanisms in far more people than has been  supposed,"" Haseltine wrote. He suggested that physicians could learn how to use  medications to similarly ""induce prolonged remissions"" in individuals who have  already tested antibody-positive.    But Haseltine acknowledged that the study raised the ""sobering"" possibilities  that many of the antibody-negative sexual partners of antibody-positive  individuals ""may actually harbor silent infection"" and that the AIDS virus ""may  be transmitted by blood and organ donors who are silently infected.""    The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that HIV may be transmitted by  blood that has tested negative for AIDS antibodies at a rate of up to 1  donation per 40,000. The CDC also estimates that between 1 million and 1.5  million Americans are infected with the AIDS virus.    Another leading AIDS researcher expressed skepticism about the new data, which  has not been independently confirmed. The researcher, who requested anonymity,  said that related research to be presented next week at the international AIDS  meeting in Montreal appears to contradict the UCLA finding of a substantial  number of silent HIV infections in high-risk gay men.    ""It is such an unexpected result,"" the researcher said of the UCLA finding. ""If  it is true, it is very disturbing. ""I would like to see it confirmed by another  laboratory.""    The new report is part of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, an ongoing  federally funded evaluation of nearly 5,000 gay men from the Los Angeles,  Chicago, Pittsburgh and Baltimore-Washington areas. Since 1984 or early 1985,  the volunteers have received semiannual exams and blood tests.    Initially, about 50% of the 1,637 gay men from the Los Angeles area tested  positive for AIDS antibodies and the rest tested negative, according to the  report. Subsequently, the UCLA researchers participating in the project began  an intensive effort to isolate HIV from the 133 antibody-negative men who  continued to have high-risk sex.    The researchers attributed their ability to find HIV in the blood of 31 of  these men to the use of a variation on a standard laboratory culturing method  for HIV isolation. These labor-intensive tests to grow the virus in the test  tube cost hundreds of dollars each and are usually performed only in research  laboratories.    When the standard culture procedure -- commonly employed to isolate the virus  from antibody-positive individuals -- was used, no virus was isolated from  antibody-negative gay men. But when the variation on this method was used, the  virus was isolated in the 31 men.    According to the report, four of the 31 gay men became antibody-positive 11 to  17 months after HIV was first isolated.    The other 27 men have remained antibody-negative for up to 36 months after the  virus was first isolated.    Many of the implications of the new data are not clear. For example, the  researchers said they do not know if antibody-negative infected individuals are  as infectious as those with positive antibody tests. Individuals with positive  AIDS antibody tests presumably have larger amounts of HIV in their bodies than  individuals who are infected with the virus but have never tested positive.    ""The unfortunate truth is that we are much better at proving who is infected,  as opposed to proving that somebody is not infected,"" said Dr. Neil Schram, an  AIDS specialist at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Harbor City and a member  of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. AIDS committee.    Schram said that on the basis of the new data antibody-negative individuals who  have engaged in high-risk sexual or intravenous drug use would need ongoing HIV  testing. He also said that individuals who have, for example, resumed high-risk  sex in a monogamous relationship after repeatedly testing antibody-negative  could still be putting their partners at risk for infection.    Dr. Steven M. Wolinsky of Northwestern University Medical School, a co-author  of the study, said that he will continue to advise patients that they are  ""unlikely to be infected"" if they have remained antibody-negative for ""a  prolonged period of time"" and have ""eliminated activities that would put them  at risk for acquiring the virus.""    Wolinsky's laboratory is in the process of performing another test that can  diagnose silent HIV infection, called the polymerase chain reaction, on nearly  3,000 antibody-negative gay men who are part of the national AIDS cohort study.  This study, which Wolinsky said should be completed within a year, should  provide a more accurate estimate of the frequency of silent HIV infections.

The team of researchers from UCLA, Northwestern University Medical School in  Chicago and Cetus Corp. in Emeryville said they isolated the AIDS virus in 31  of a group of 133 gay men who had tested antibody-negative.      Dangerous Sexual Practices    The researchers sought gay men who they thought were likely to be infected,  despite negative antibody tests. Such men continued to engage in anal  intercourse with multiple partners and other dangerous sexual practices.    For this reason, the scientists cautioned that their findings could not be  generalized to others who have tested negative for AIDS antibodies, many of  whom are at lower risk of infection and may never have been exposed to the  virus in the first place.    ""This is a select group,"" Imagawa said. ""We cannot provide an estimate of the  proportion of (all) HIV infections that do not stimulate measurable  antibodies.""    Antibody molecules are proteins produced by the body's immune system to fight  foreign germs, such as the AIDS virus. AIDS antibodies are measured by standard  tests called the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ""Western blot.""    Antibodies are commonly detected in the blood within several months of HIV  infection. But previously a small number of infections had been recognized  where the delay was one to three years or more.    In a New England Journal of Medicine editorial also published today, William A.  Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston said the new data may  have ""encouraging"" as well as ""disquieting"" implications.    The ""good news"" is that the evidence that some infected men have not developed  antibodies may suggest they are somehow warding off the disease. The  replication of the AIDS virus ""may be spontaneously suppressed by a combination  of cellular, viral and immune mechanisms in far more people than has been  supposed,"" Haseltine wrote. He suggested that physicians could learn how to use  medications to similarly ""induce prolonged remissions"" in individuals who have  already tested antibody-positive.    But Haseltine acknowledged that the study raised the ""sobering"" possibilities  that many of the antibody-negative sexual partners of antibody-positive  individuals ""may actually harbor silent infection"" and that the AIDS virus ""may  be transmitted by blood and organ donors who are silently infected.""    The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that HIV may be transmitted by  blood that has tested negative for AIDS antibodies at a rate of up to 1  donation per 40,000. The CDC also estimates that between 1 million and 1.5  million Americans are infected with the AIDS virus.    Another leading AIDS researcher expressed skepticism about the new data, which  has not been independently confirmed. The researcher, who requested anonymity,  said that related research to be presented next week at the international AIDS  meeting in Montreal appears to contradict the UCLA finding of a substantial  number of silent HIV infections in high-risk gay men.    ""It is such an unexpected result,"" the researcher said of the UCLA finding. ""If  it is true, it is very disturbing. ""I would like to see it confirmed by another  laboratory.""    The new report is part of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, an ongoing  federally funded evaluation of nearly 5,000 gay men from the Los Angeles,  Chicago, Pittsburgh and Baltimore-Washington areas. Since 1984 or early 1985,  the volunteers have received semiannual exams and blood tests.    Initially, about 50% of the 1,637 gay men from the Los Angeles area tested  positive for AIDS antibodies and the rest tested negative, according to the  report. Subsequently, the UCLA researchers participating in the project began  an intensive effort to isolate HIV from the 133 antibody-negative men who  continued to have high-risk sex.    The researchers attributed their ability to find HIV in the blood of 31 of  these men to the use of a variation on a standard laboratory culturing method  for HIV isolation. These labor-intensive tests to grow the virus in the test  tube cost hundreds of dollars each and are usually performed only in research  laboratories.    When the standard culture procedure -- commonly employed to isolate the virus  from antibody-positive individuals -- was used, no virus was isolated from  antibody-negative gay men. But when the variation on this method was used, the  virus was isolated in the 31 men.    According to the report, four of the 31 gay men became antibody-positive 11 to  17 months after HIV was first isolated.    The other 27 men have remained antibody-negative for up to 36 months after the  virus was first isolated.    Many of the implications of the new data are not clear. For example, the  researchers said they do not know if antibody-negative infected individuals are  as infectious as those with positive antibody tests. Individuals with positive  AIDS antibody tests presumably have larger amounts of HIV in their bodies than  individuals who are infected with the virus but have never tested positive.    ""The unfortunate truth is that we are much better at proving who is infected,  as opposed to proving that somebody is not infected,"" said Dr. Neil Schram, an  AIDS specialist at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Harbor City and a member  of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. AIDS committee.    Schram said that on the basis of the new data antibody-negative individuals who  have engaged in high-risk sexual or intravenous drug use would need ongoing HIV  testing. He also said that individuals who have, for example, resumed high-risk  sex in a monogamous relationship after repeatedly testing antibody-negative  could still be putting their partners at risk for infection.    Dr. Steven M. Wolinsky of Northwestern University Medical School, a co-author  of the study, said that he will continue to advise patients that they are  ""unlikely to be infected"" if they have remained antibody-negative for ""a  prolonged period of time"" and have ""eliminated activities that would put them  at risk for acquiring the virus.""    Wolinsky's laboratory is in the process of performing another test that can  diagnose silent HIV infection, called the polymerase chain reaction, on nearly  3,000 antibody-negative gay men who are part of the national AIDS cohort study.  This study, which Wolinsky said should be completed within a year, should  provide a more accurate estimate of the frequency of silent HIV infections.

Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker, reported parent pre-tax losses of Y26.3bn (Dollars 239.1m) for the year ended March, compared with profits of Y87.8bn previously. The company recorded its first ever net loss, at Y15.1bn, compared with a profit of Y54.2bn. Non-consolidated sales fell 8.7 per cent to Y3,896bn. The dividend is being halved to Y7 a share. Nissan blamed difficult trading on the steep decline in domestic demand for vehicles and the sharp appreciation of the yen. Last year domestic sales fall 17 per cent in unit terms and 18 per cent in value. Export sales, on the other hand, were up 4.2 per cent, largely as a result of an increase in sales of parts and components for overseas production. On a consolidated basis, sales were down 3.4 per cent to Y6,198bn, leading to pre-tax losses of Y108bn and net losses of Y56bn. There was a Y45bn write-off in Australia. In the current year, Nissan is projecting domestic vehicle sales of 1.2m units and overseas sales of 76,000 units. As a result, sales are expected to rise to Y4,000bn this year. Nissan is looking to break even both at the pre-tax and net-profits level. Pre-tax losses of Y40bn in the first half are expected to be reversed in the second half as a result of an improved trading climate and Y150bn in additional revenues stemming from higher prices and streamlining. The outlook from Mazda, Japan's fifth largest carmaker, is less optimistic. Mazda yesterday warned it would not be profitable this year following a steep fall in profits in 1992. The company saw a 5 per cent decline in non-consolidated sales to Y2,191bn, while pre-tax profits plunged 68 per cent to Y6.2bn. Net profits were 71 per cent down to Y2.6bn. Mazda, which is 24.5 per cent owned by Ford of the US, said it was also under pressure from high depreciation costs. Total factory unit sales declined 11 per cent for passenger cars and 22 per cent for commercial vehicles. The biggest setback came in the domestic market where unit sales were 16 per cent down, compared with a 7 per cent decline in overseas markets. Mazda's performance was disappointing even given the overall weakness of the Japanese car market last year, which declined 7.4 per cent in unit terms, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Mitsubishi Motors reported a 8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, to Y46.6bn, in spite of a 2.4 per cent increase in sales to Y2,615.9bn. While Mitsubishi saw a 67 per cent increase in sales of passenger cars, it suffered a 20 per cent fall in sales of mini-cars and double-digit declines in sales of trucks. The company forecasts a 1 per cent increase in volumes this year, a slight increase in sales to Y2,630bn, and an increase to Y48.5bn in pre-tax profits.   Companies:-  Nissan Motor Corp.

Natural gas is kept in this compressed state to increase the amount that can be stored on-board the vehicle. This serves, in turn, to increase the vehicle's driving range. Since natural gas is flammable and is stored under high pressure when used as a vehicle fuel, it poses a potential risk to motor vehicle safety.        1     Standard temperature is 0   Celsius or 32   Fahrenheit and standard pressure is 101.4 kiloPascals (kPa) or 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi).         Alternative fuel vehicles powered by CNG have not been numerous to date. The number of CNG vehicles in the United States has more than doubled from 10,300 in 1990 to 23,800 at the end of 1992. The number of CNG vehicles is projected to again double to an estimated 50,800 vehicles in 1994.  However, Federal legislation, as well as the need to meet environmental and energy security goals, will lead to increased production and use of these vehicles. Among the items of Federal legislation encouraging the use of alternative fuels in general are: (1) The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, (2) the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and (3) the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 directs the Department of Energy to conduct demonstration programs to encourage the use of alternative motor fuels, including natural gas. As a further encouragement, this Act also specifies that new passenger automobiles will have their fuel economy calculated according to a special mileage enhancing procedure. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 establish the clean fuel requirements that treat fuel type and content, along with vehicle technology, as a potential source of emission reductions. These Amendments call for programs that will substantially increase the number of low-polluting vehicle/fuel combinations in use. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 directs the Department of Transportation to issue safety standards applicable to vehicle conversions.  Executive branch initiatives will also encourage the increased use of alternative fueled vehicles. Executive Order 12844 increased by 50 percent the number of alternative fueled vehicles to be acquired by the Federal Government from 1993 through 1995.

The accident occurred Sunday night when a Toyota pickup truck driven by a  35-year-old man plowed into the back of a Ford truck, loaded with 13 people,  that was stopped on the paved shoulder of the Santa Ana Freeway, California  Highway Patrol officers said.    The driver, Michael K. Andersen of Whittier was booked for investigation of  felony drunk driving and manslaughter, authorities said.    Andersen's truck, outfitted as a utility vehicle containing carpenter's  equipment, was moving ""about 60 to 65 m.p.h."" when the accident occurred  shortly before 11 p.m., CHP Officer Dave Boyland said.    Three people were in the cab of the Ford, 10 were in the bed, and one boy was  standing next to the pickup, which was stopped on the shoulder of the  southbound lanes of the freeway just north of Pioneer Boulevard, Boyland said.    ""They stopped on the shoulder because a little boy, 7 years old, had to go to  the bathroom,"" Boyland said. "" . . . He went into the bushes, and that's when  Andersen came down with his utility carpenter truck and wiped everybody out.""    Boyland said he believed all the victims were related and were returning home  to the San Diego area after an outing in Los Angeles.    The Los Angeles County coroner's office identified those killed as Angelica  Flores, 22, and her 2-year-old daughter, Vanessa Figueroa, both of San Ysidro;  Ernestina Sanchez, 13, and Ernesto Sanchez Jr., 4, both of San Diego.    CHP investigators said they were told that Flores was seven months pregnant,  but coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said that could not be confirmed pending  an autopsy.    The 10 other injured passengers were treated at five hospitals. Two were in  critical condition at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. They were identified  as Irma Flores, 20, of San Ysidro, suffering head injuries, and a 7-year-old  girl with multiple fractures who underwent surgery to remove her spleen, a  hospital spokesman said. Her name was not released.    Two hospitalized at Norwalk Community Hospital were described in stable  condition, but their names were also not released. Six other victims were  treated at hospitals and released.    Results of blood alcohol tests on Andersen were not immediately available,  Boyland said.    ""He admits to drinking two beers,"" the officer added.    The suspect remained jailed Monday at the Norwalk Sheriff's Station in lieu of  $50,000 bail. Arraignment was set for Wednesday in Downey Superior Court.    State Department of Motor Vehicles records showed Andersen had been cited in  1985 for driving with a suspended license, in 1988 for speeding and in 1989 for  changing lanes without due caution.    Sunday night's crash kept all southbound freeway lanes closed for about seven  hours as Caltrans crews cleared the wreckage from the roadway.    Under California law, children under age 12 may ride in the back of a pickup  truck if an adult is present, according to CHP spokeswoman Lydia Martinez.

0,FT931-15880 ,"FT931-15880 _AN-DAKB8AD5FT 930109   FT  09 JAN 93 / US carmakers attack Japan's quota freeze      By KEVIN DONE and ROBERT THOMSON      DETROIT, TOKYO   US CARMAKERS yesterday launched a fierce attack on Japan's decision not to reduce the number of cars it exports to the US under a voluntary restraint agreement. Tokyo's announcement that it would freeze the quota at last year's level of 1.65m units showed it was 'not very concerned' about lowering its trade surplus with the US, said Mr Harold Poling, chairman and chief executive of Ford. In a joint offensive with the chief executives of General Motors and Chrysler, Mr Poling said the US was facing 'a critical time for our nation'. The world trading system could not survive if one country 'sought to achieve economic superpower status at the expense of other countries', said Mr Poling. The quota announcement coincided with the release of a US Commerce Department forecast that the US is likely to see a 9.5 per cent increase to Dollars 21.9bn (Pounds 14.4bn) in the deficit this year in car and car parts trade with Japan. Japan reduced the quota from 2.3m units to 1.65m units in 1991 but the US car industry has been looking for further cuts, arguing that the figure had become meaningless as it did not take into account the US production capacity of Japanese makers. US car industry leaders were encouraged by meeting President-elect Bill Clinton this week and believe his administration offers a great opportunity to intensify pressure on Japan to reduce the US trade deficit. They urged the US to take moves to: Demand equal access to foreign markets for US-made goods and services, and take action if this access is denied. Implement laws to prevent 'predatory practices by foreign competitors'. Co-ordinate economic and regulatory policies to assure the competitiveness of US industries in world markets. Mr Poling called for Japan to take action to reduce its trade surplus with the US from Dollars 43bn now to Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn over the next five years. Automative trade alone presently accounts for around Dollars 33bn of the Japanese surplus. Excess capacity in the world vehicle industry now stood at around 11m units, claimed Mr Poling, while production capacity in Japan exceeded home market demand by more than 100 per cent. Japan and the European Community had agreed to limit Japanese market share increases in Europe, warned Mr Poling, so excess world capacity would be 'directed towards the US market at the further expense of US jobs' if the US market continued to be the 'most open market in the world'. Japan's open markets remained among the most closed in the world, he said. The Japan Automobile Importers' Association said imported vehicle sales fell 7.7 per cent last year to 184,615 units, the second consecutive year of decline, Robert Thomson writes. Total sales in the Japanese market fell 7.2 per cent to 5.3m units. Sales of US-made cars rose 23.1 per cent, but the largest increase was in imports of Japanese makers' vehicles. Ford Motor sales rose 15 per cent and Chrysler's 7.4 per cent but GM's sales declined by 1.9 per cent.   Countries:-  USZ  USA.     JPZ  Japan, Asia.

Michael Sean O'Brien, 39, has been charged with felony drunk driving under a  law that calls for more serious punishment for repeat drunk drivers. In the  past, drunk driving has been treated as a felony only if someone was injured or  killed in an accident.    Under the new law, a person with three drunk driving convictions within 7 years  may be charged with a felony if he is arrested again on the same charge, said  Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Margaret A. Powers.    Powers said O'Brien has been convicted of driving under the influence of  alcohol 13 times since 1974. Two other drunk driving charges against O'Brien  were reduced to reckless driving, Powers said.    ""If that law was meant for anybody, it was meant for him,"" Powers said. She  said it was ""a miracle"" that O'Brien had not injured or killed someone.    According to the Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento, O'Brien has not  had a valid driver's license since 1977.

Michael Sean O'Brien, 39, has been charged with felony drunk driving under a  law that calls for more serious punishment for repeat drunk drivers. In the  past, drunk driving has been treated as a felony only if someone was injured or  killed in an accident.    Under the new law, a person with three drunk driving convictions within 7 years  may be charged with a felony if he is arrested again on the same charge, said  Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Margaret A. Powers.    Powers said O'Brien has been convicted of driving under the influence of  alcohol 13 times since 1974. Two other drunk driving charges against O'Brien  were reduced to reckless driving, Powers said.    ""If that law was meant for anybody, it was meant for him,"" Powers said.

0,FT942-4415 ,"FT942-4415 _AN-EFPDDAHCFT 940610   FT  10 JUN 94 / VW close to deal with Madrid on aid      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DAVID WHITE      FRANKFURT, MADRID   Volkswagen and the Madrid government yesterday came close to an agreement in negotiations over state aid for Seat, the German vehicle group's crippled Spanish subsidiary. Further talks are scheduled next week and VW said a deal could be expected not long after that. According to a joint statement from Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and Mr Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, the Spanish industry minister, the two agreed that there should be no direct subsidies from the Spanish government for redundancies. Help would come instead in the form of support for technological projects. VW initially sought an injection of Dm820m (Pounds 328m) from Spanish central and regional authorities to cover 4,600 further job cuts at Seat, reducing the company's workforce to 9,500. Other multinational motor companies manufacturing in Spain reacted sharply against the prospect of special conditions for Seat. The statement made clear that state aid would be tied to 'certain commitments' from VW and from Seat itself. It also said an agreement would be aimed at 'keeping the basic elements of Seat as a company with its own capability for competing in the global market'. The uncertain scale of Madrid's financial commitment is crucial to VW's bid to plug the hole in VW group finances which is threatening for the second year in succession to sink hopes of breaking even. Seat lost DM1.8bn (Pounds 720m) in 1993, was DM350m in the red in the first quarter of this year, and is heading for a further full-year deficit of DM1bn, according to company officials. The result would be even worse if VW had to bear the full restructuring costs. Yesterday's talks were also attended by mr Gerhard Schroder premier of the state of Lower Saxony, which is VW's main shareholder, and senior officials of Catalonia's regional government. The two-hour meeting marked the start of substantive negotiations following a bout of shadow-boxing interspersed with implicit and explicit threats from VW. These ranged from veiled hints that Seat might be declared insolvent, to clearer warnings that the company could lose its independence. Since the unexpected discovery of last year's losses and the sacking of the former chairman last September, Seat has already lost much of its independence. In return for emergency cash injections, Volkswagen has taken control of Seat's Pamplona factory and financial services division. The Zona Franca plant in Barcelona - subject of the current negotiations - is to be closed, leaving Seat with just one works, a new plant at Martorell. More recently VW has suggested that research and design might be taken over by the German parent, effectively leaving Seat stripped down to a manufacturing and distribution operation. Last month German executives with close links to Mr Piech were installed in central board and management positions, although Spaniard Mr Joan Llorens remained as chairman. Yesterday's progress followed encouraging hints from Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, after he discussed the issue at a meeting last weekend with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Spain was prepared to accept 'certain responsibilities,' Mr Gonzalez said.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Sociedad de Espana Automoviles de Turismo.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

Production at Ryton is to be limited to one model, the Peugeot 306 small family car. Total output at the plant is being reduced to about 1,600 a week from the level earlier in the year of 1,900 a week. About 300 jobs are being cut from the workforce of 5,280 (excluding the group's Robins and Day retail dealerships). The ending of 405 production in the UK is a big setback for the Ryton plant, which only resumed production of two car ranges in January with the launch of the Peugeot 306. The Peugeot group is cutting production at Ryton as part of its overall reduction in output across its European plants in response to the sharp decline in west European new car sales this year. New-car sales in west Europe fell by an estimated 17.7 per cent in the first seven months of the year, while sales in France, where Peugeot's market share is being seriously eroded, have fallen by 17.1 per cent. Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, is also cutting output at its two UK assembly plants in response to the fall in European sales. Production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra at its plant at Luton, Bedfordshire is being stopped this week with the loss of nine shifts while night-shift production of the Vauxhall/Opel Astra at its plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, is also being eliminated this week with the loss of four shifts. A further three shifts will be eliminated at the Luton plant later this month. In the first eight months of the year Vauxhall will have cut 60 production shifts at the Luton plant and 10 at Ellesmere Port. Vauxhall vehicle output rose by 15.3 per cent last year to a record 301,857. In the first seven months of this year it has fallen 11.1 per cent to 161,792 from 181,919 in the same period the year before. Output of the Cavalier/Vectra fell by 22 per cent in the first six months to 70,681. Ford, the biggest UK vehicle maker, which had already cut capacity across its European assembly plants late last year, has also been forced to implement a limited amount of short-time working. Production at its Southampton Transit van plant was halted yesterday with the loss of two shifts, although normal output will be resumed today. In the first eight months of the year Ford has cut 22 shifts at the Southampton van plant, 24 shifts at the Halewood, Merseyside assembly plant which produces the Escort/Orion range and five at the Fiesta small-car assembly plant in Dagenham, east London.

0,FT931-7010 ,"FT931-7010 _AN-DBZCKAD5FT 930226   FT  26 FEB 93 / In-car guidance system could help Scots beat traffic jams      By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent   CENTRAL SCOTLAND could be-come the first place in Britain where cars will be equipped with guidance systems to direct motorists along the best route to their destination and provide an instant warning of traffic jams. Cars would be fitted with devices loaded with electronic maps using technology similar to that of a cruise missile. Drivers would type in their destination and receive route instructions by voice simulator or display. The in-car device would suggest alternative routes when traffic jams were reported and would follow the creation of an integrated traffic management system. The system would monitor main roads in the greater Glasgow area and those north and south of the Forth estuary including Edinburgh. Lord James Douglas Hamilton, the Scottish Office roads minister, is expected today to name the four companies which have been shortlisted to bid for the upgrading and expansion of the two existing traffic management systems in these areas. The four, pre-selected from 20 applicants to tender for the project, are thought likely to include GEC, which has developed traffic management and in-car guidance systems, and Siemens. The first stage will cost about Pounds 12m and the traffic management project will eventually total Pounds 33m. The new system will use electronic detectors under roads to measure traffic flows more accurately than the present systems. The data will be fed to a central computer and information about unexpected hold-ups, and alternative routes, will be displayed on new roadside indicator boards. It will also be fed to local radio stations for instant broadcast to cars with radios fitted to receive dedicated traffic information. Many newer car radios have an RDS (radio data system) button to receive traffic messages. Once the new traffic management system is in place, probably by 1995, the central computer can be used to support in-car guidance systems which would be introduced on a commercial basis. The Scottish Office will issue a consultation document today on how this could be done. The existence of the central computer reduces the entry costs for potential commercial operators of in-car guidance systems, and therefore the Scottish Office wants to find a way of financing the entire project which recognises the advantages to both the public and private sector. It is considering leasing the traffic management system to the company which installs it and allowing that company to operate it under contract. In last November's Autumn Statement, the government eased the rules on mixing public and private finance in infrastructure projects. Although a small pilot scheme for in-car guidance is likely to be launched in a part of London next year, the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas could be the first in Britain to have a comprehensive in-car guidance system. A system named Trafficmaster, which informs drivers of the location of hold-ups, already operates around the M25 and is spreading to other motorways.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Predicted Single Vehicle Accident Rate       To estimate the number of single vehicle accidents in a hypothetical future vehicle population, NHTSA assumed that the future population would have the same proportion of vans, pickups, and sport utility vehicles as the 1991 production, and that the population would have the same proportion of high and low critical sliding velocity and tilt table angle vehicles within these categories.   NHTSA then distributed the numbers of serious injuries by vehicle category (as tabulated by Data Link Inc., under contract to NHTSA) among the 1991 example vehicles on the basis of relative production volume, relative single vehicle accident involvement rate, and relative rollover risk per single vehicle accident. (The Data Link reports are available in Docket 9168, Notice 2.) Data Link reported injuries and fatalities by vehicle types: pickup truck, van, sport utility vehicle (called MPV in Data Link reports), and car. NHTSA further divided the vehicle types into subcategories of compact and standard to make average accident rate and rollover risk more meaningful.   NHTSA also divided injuries and fatalities between compact and standard versions of each vehicle type. To do this, NHTSA assumed that rollover harm was proportional to the number of rollover accidents within a vehicle type. The numbers of rollover accidents among compact vehicles relative to those among their standard counterparts were estimated by multiplying their 1991 production ratios by their single vehicle accident per registered vehicle ratios and their RO/SVA ratios. The total number of injuries and fatalities was then divided proportionally.            "
0,FT944-9406 ,"FT944-9406 _AN-EKPEKAA7FT 941116   FT  16 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Mercedes-Benz unveils people's car prototype - Carmakers jostle for stake in China project      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   Mercedes-Benz was prepared to invest up to DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in China to build 250,000 models a year of its 'people's car' designed specifically for the local market, a senior representative of the German carmaker said yesterday. Mr Jurgen Hubbert, head of Mercedes-Benz's car division, said that efforts to win Chinese approval for the family car project were part of the 'globalisation' of the company's business. 'The increasing internationalisation of world business has led the company to go one step further than export or foreign assembly,' he said. 'Mercedes-Benz is now looking for overseas production locations where it will not just assemble, but develop and manufacture passenger cars of the highest quality.' Mr Hubbert was speaking after Mercedes-Benz had unveiled its prototype Family Car China (FCC) at a lavish exhibition in Beijing, attended by 22 international carmakers showing their wares in an attempt to be selected as partners in a Chinese people's car project. China's Ministry of Machinery Industry, responsible for the vehicle sector, said it would select successful bidders within a year. It is not clear whether there will be more than one company selected. China announced earlier this year that it aimed by the year 2000 to have built an industry capable of supplying 90 per cent of domestic requirements of about 1.5m cars annually. China manufactured 234,000 cars last year. Among Mercedes-Benz's competitors are Porsche and Volkswagen of Germany, Nissan and Toyota of Japan, Fiat of Italy, Daewoo and Hyundai of South Korea and General Motors and Ford of the US. Porsche, like Mercedes-Benz, has developed a prototype for the Chinese market known as the C88. To overcome scepticism about the involvement of a luxury carmaker in the project, Porsche executives are publicising the fact that it was Ferdinand Porsche who designed and built the first Volkswagen in the mid-1930s. Mr Stefan Geist, Porsche's marketing manager, said that one of the company's aims was to show that 'we not only produce sports cars, we are also able to do other things like providing design and engineering services'. Unlike Mercedes-Benz, whose interest is in a 50-50 joint venture producing cars, Porsche wants to supply basic design and engineering assistance to a Chinese manufacturer in return for a fee or royalty on models produced. Ford, which is showing its Fiesta and other small models in Beijing this week, also invoked the past to strengthen its claims to participate in the people's car project. Referring to the Model T Ford, the world's first mass-produced car, Mr Wayne Booker, executive vice-president for international automotive operations, said: 'Ninety-one years ago Henry Ford had a vision of providing the greatest good for the greatest number of people. From that beginning Ford has adhered to the vision of serving working people.' Volkswagen, the German carmaker which is already the leading car producer in China, said the Seat Cordoba, introduced in China recently as the City Golf, could be the basis for a people's car. Mr Martin Posth, responsible for Asia, said VW would present a complete concept covering development, production, national specialisation, distribution and service.   Companies:-  Mercedes-Benz.

In that suit, Public Advocates Inc. asked the court for an order requiring the  Legislature, which had made auto insurance mandatory, to act so that coverage  would be more available and affordable. The court's refusal to issue such an  order is credited by some with fueling the reform drive that led to five  insurance initiatives on the 1988 ballot.    In a letter last week to each of the seven Supreme Court justices, lawyers  Armando M. Menocal III and Lois Salisbury of Public Advocates quoted from  suggestions that the Supreme Court had made in dismissing the class-action suit  and contended that in passing Proposition 103, the electorate had been acting  in pursuit of those suggestions.    Accordingly, they told the justices, ""We ask that the solution crafted and  enacted by the people, Proposition 103, be respected and deferred to by this  court.""    The Supreme Court has stayed the rate rollbacks in Proposition 103, pending its  constitutional review, but in the meantime has allowed almost all the rest of  it to tentatively go into effect. The insurance industry lawsuit now before the  court, however, asks the justices to strike down all of Proposition 103.    In their letter, Menocal and Salisbury noted that since enforcement of the  mandatory auto insurance law began at the end of 1987, the state Department of  Motor Vehicles says it has suspended 250,000 licenses of drivers caught without  the required auto liability insurance.    The thrust of the class-action suit brought mainly on behalf of minority  drivers in South and East Los Angeles was that under the territorial rating  system used by insurance companies, the insurance cost more in low-income,  central city areas than anywhere else. The suit asked for relief.    The high court, turning this down, said the plaintiffs had not gone to the  right place for relief. ""Their case should be made to the Legislature, not to  this court,"" the justices ruled.    Menocal and Salisbury said in their letter that after the decision, ""the  Legislature struggled unsuccessfully for an entire year to solve the problem,""  leading those seeking relief to turn to the initiative process.    ""Ultimately, the voters of the State of California took action, passing  Proposition 103,"" they said, adding that certain provisions of the measure,  reducing territorial ratings as a factor in pricing, rolling back rates and  setting new competitive guidelines for the sale of insurance ""will correct many  of the profound inequities and frustrations"" that their class-action suit had  been aimed at redressing.    Salisbury, interviewed Sunday, said: ""What's unusual in all of this is the  quick sequence of events. Within a year of the time the court told us to seek  redress through legislation, the Legislature foundered and the public did take  action, legislating on its own.""

Anthony Salas, 29, a guard for the Federal Armored Express company, was slain  as he made a pick-up Tuesday at a crowded Department of Motor Vehicles office  on Mission Drive. It was the sixth holdup of an armored car courier in the Los  Angeles area in the last year, and it prompted the DMV to seek added security  for its Los Angeles offices.    Using attack dogs and helicopters, police scoured the neighborhoods surrounding  the DMV office after the shooting. A red 1982 Toyota Celica that police said  the gunmen had fled in was found about a mile away.    The car was registered to an apartment address in the 1700 block of Cherokee  Avenue in Hollywood. Late Tuesday, detectives armed with search warrants went  to the apartment and arrested Mirna Guerra, 19, and Oscar Mendoza, 22.    Both are from El Salvador and were booked on suspicion of conspiracy to commit  murder, police spokesmen said. They were being held in jail without bail.    Another man arrested with the pair at the apartment was booked on an unrelated  misdemeanor warrant. He was identified as Gil Sanchez, 19.    ""We believe they (Guerra and Mendoza) were involved in the planning of the  robbery,"" Lt. Fred Nixon said. The LAPD spokesman would not elaborate but added  that the actual triggerman and an accomplice were still being sought.    In a house-to-house search of the area surrounding the DMV office, police also  found a discarded duffel bag containing more than $10,000 stolen in the holdup,  as well as guns and clothing allegedly used by the suspects.    Salas, the slain courier, had arrived at the DMV office shortly before 1 p.m.  Tuesday, entered the vault area, dropped off one bag and picked up another  containing receipts, checks and cash.    His partner had remained inside the armored car, in accordance with company  policy. As Salas neared the exit, two men -- one with a pistol drawn --  approached him from behind. The gunman shot Salas in the back and head, and he  was pronounced dead on the scene.    The DMV office was reopened Wednesday but eight employees -- among an estimated  50 to 60 employees and customers who witnessed the shooting -- said they were  too distraught to work and were given the day off, DMV spokesman Bill Gengler  said.    ""The events of yesterday got to them,"" he said. ""They were very emotionally  upset.""    In addition, the DMV has asked State Police to post additional guards and take  other security measures at several of its offices in the Los Angeles area.    Gengler said the added security will be a temporary measure.    Although State Police officers are frequently posted at DMV installations, none  was assigned to the Mission Road office on Tuesday. An armed investigator with  security and other duties was present however, Gengler said.    Despite the flurry of armored car robberies, police said they have not been  able to link the DMV holdup to the earlier crimes.    ""There's nothing to show there's a connection,"" Nixon said.

0,FT942-14902 ,"FT942-14902 _AN-EDRDZAEWFT 940418   FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (11): Need before status  -Operator profile / ASDA      By GARY MEAD   All the UK's big food retailers are finding their margins under pressure these days. This is leading to a renewed determination to keep down costs, including very often a re-think on company car policies, writes Gary Mead. One of the more determined approaches has been that of Asda, fourth-biggest of the supermarket groups, serving about 4m customers weekly. The company's fleet which in 1992 peaked at 1,250 units, is now down to just below 1,000 units. It leases all its cars because of tax benefits and 'to avoid exposure to the risk on residual values'. According to Asda, the company is trying to get away from the notion of a company car being a status trophy, encouraging instead the view that it is a tool, to be given to executives according to performance and need. There are five levels of eligibility for a car within the company. A car used to be given according to an executive's grade in the company hierarchy, but since June 1993 a new policy has been introduced which relates an employee's remuneration to performance and not to managerial position. Asda says the 'new flexibility has been very popular with car drivers'. The policy gives those eligible for a company car a wide range of choice of make and brand, the only restrictions being for insurance reasons on 'hot hatches', two-seaters or soft tops. Previously only a narrow narrow range of cars was available. As part of its efforts to tighten cost controls Asda at the same time altered its policy on replacements. Where it was three years or 60,000 miles, it is now four years or 80,000 miles. The company says it encourages the use of diesels because of greater fuel efficiency. Individuals are offered the choice of a better model than he or she would otherwise be eligible for, if the choice is a diesel model. Asda operates a single supplier policy and has used Avis for the past five years, though it does periodically put the business out for competitive tendering. It says that economies of scale, plus the ease of dealing with a single supplier, suits it better than having a range of different suppliers. Moreover, it has outsourced most of its fleet administration, with executives dealing directly with Avis on all matters relating to their cars. The biggest issue concerns the new tax regime, and whether or not it is beneficial to drive a company car. So far only 20 Asda executives have decided to take up the cash allowance being offered instead of the company car. The company has only been offering the cash offer for a year, and the offer can be taken up only when a car comes up for replacement, so it remains early days. The company says it expects the proportion taking up the cash offer to increase steadily. The allowance reflects the lease price, plus petrol and insurance costs. Asda executives who do modest business mileage are becoming very sensitive to list prices when selecting their new car - a natural response in the circumstances.   Companies:-  ASDA Group.

But even if the monitors stay up late, the drivers, keeping in touch through walkie-talkies, can choose from dozens of unwatched tracks to cross the frontier. As measures to enforce sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro have tightened along the Danube and Serbia's border with Bulgaria, Macedonia has become the main supply route for the rump Yugoslavia. According to the UN protection force, which also monitors the border, about 4,000 trucks make the crossing in both directions every week. Vehicles carrying oil products, construction materials and spare parts for heavy machinery have been spotted, but not stopped. The 38-member sanctions assistance mission, made up of customs officers from several countries, encourage the Macedonian customs service to inspect loads crossing the border. But it has no authority to enforce the sanctions. 'Once in a while the customs will follow our suggestions, but whole days go by when no trucks get inspected,' said Mr Gordon Evers, a Canadian customs official leading the SAM team. The rail link between Athens and Belgrade is still in operation. Two or three freight trains leave Skopje every night and tanker trains carrying oil head north several times a week. Macedonia, which was admitted to the UN earlier this year, has formally backed the embargo against Serbia, its main trading partner. The government claims that the sanctions cost the Macedonian economy more than Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 810m) last year. However, government officials argue that the economy is so battered by the loss of trade with Serbia, together with the effects of more than a year of diplomatic isolation, that it cannot be expected to apply sanctions fully unless compensation is guaranteed. 'We ask the UN about compensation and they refer us to the European Community. There's no money in sight, but we have to cope with another 15 per cent fall in industrial output this year and an unemployment rate of more than 30 per cent,' says a government economic adviser. Macedonian officials admit, too, that their enthusiasm for complying with sanctions has been diluted by delays in the arrival of Ecu100m (Pounds 76.4m) in EC aid, promised last December. Half of that amount is being contributed by member states on a bilateral basis, with the rest provided by the European Commission. The government also claims it is being blackmailed into shipping oil to Serbia by Greece, which is Macedonia's main source for oil supplies. According to a senior Macedonian official, Greece last month threatened to cut off all oil shipments to Macedonia unless half the supply from the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki, amounting to more than 80,000 tonnes monthly, was sent on to Serbia.

0,FT933-13176 ,"FT933-13176 _AN-DGUCEAAUFT 930721   FT  21 JUL 93 / Legal reverse for VW and Lopez      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   THE legal squeeze on the top management of Volkswagen was intensified yesterday as a Hamburg civil court loosened reporting restrictions imposed last month on Der Spiegel, Germany's leading news weekly. The result will open up once again the public debate on claims by General Motors of the US and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel, that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM director, and several of his associates who joined VW with him, took industrial secrets with them to the German group. Meanwhile, speculation mounted that state prosecutors, investigating possible criminal charges in the light of GM's claims, will make a formal statement later this week. After yesterday's ruling, which followed an open hearing last Thursday, the magazine can, for example, resume reporting on its earlier claims that Mr Lopez took boxes of industrial secrets with him when he quit GM for a directorship at VW in March. It may also pursue its charges that Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez, a close associate of Mr Lopez who followed his former GM chief to VW almost immediately, asked for and was given 'strictly confidential' details of a new GM diesel engine. The court, which imposed a gagging order at VW's request last month after the publication of two detailed articles, also lifted the injunction in regard to a claim that Mr Lopez had 'reached an agreement' to join VW with Mr Ferdinand Piech, at the start of this year. In an affidavit presented in court last week, and signed by Mr Piech, the VW chairman stated that Mr Lopez decided to move on March 9. The court also accepted testimony that Mr Lopez had in effect written a speech, intended to explain to GM employees why he had decided not to join VW, which was not in the event delivered. After checking the final draft on the morning of March 15, he left the US for Germany. Mr Lopez stated in an affidavit presented last Thursday that he did not write it, and that its had been written by 'GM'. Mr Lopez and VW were represented at the hearing by a single lawyer while Der Spiegel had more than 20 witnesses, all GM employees, on hand to support its case. although only three were called. All the claims on which the court loosened the gag yesterday have been firmly and consistently denied by VW and its executives, although as Mr Harald Ficus, presiding judge, said last week, his court was not the place for deciding the truth or otherwise of the suspicions aired in Der Spiegel. However, Volkswagen was obliged to bear most of the costs of the case. In German courts apportionment of costs shows the extent to which the parties involved have gained or lost, according to legal experts. On the single issue of Der Spiegel's reports on diesel engine secrets, Mr Gutierrez was made responsible for the whole DM100,000 (Pounds 38,759). In another case, concerning complaints made in the German group's name - including Mr Piech's claims on the planning and timing of Mr Lopez's switch  -VW was obliged to pay two-thirds of the DM500,000 costs.

MARKET'S ON A ROLL      From Town & Country      Some 10 to 15 million people worldwide call themselves car collectors -- from  the bidder who paid $10.8 million for a Ferrari at auction to the kid who buys  a '59 Cadillac sedan because it's on the album cover of his favorite heavy  metal band.

Most of the activity in the car-collector field is in cars that cost less than  $50,000, however, and at this less expensive end of the market, the prices are  appreciating as rapidly as they are at the seven-figure end.    At present, Ferrari prices appear to have peaked, while less expensive  Maserati, Alfa Romeo, Cisitalia, Abarth, Lamborghini and Iso models have picked  up speed. At the moment, anything red and Italian is hot. Even such obscure  models as the Iso Rivolta have gone from $5,000 to $50,000 in less than 12  months.    What powers car-collecting trends? Most collectors crave an automobile that was  popular when both they and it were young. The age of envy appears to be 14.    Right now baby-boomers in the 26- to 45-year-old age group are driving up the  prices of cars built between 1960 and 1980.    In recent years, collector cars on average have done better than virtually any  other investment but not every old car is a smart investment.    High-quality blue chips such as Duesenbergs will always be in demand, while  there are high-risk automobiles that are currently overlooked but ought to be  in great demand in the future.    All experts agree that vintage racing cars in all price ranges are the hottest  collector-car category today and will be for the foreseeable future. A group of  experts offer these tips on car collecting:     -- Don't buy a car to restore. Restoring an old car is more difficult and  often more expensive than restoring an old house, and it's easy to get ripped  off.     -- Don't buy a 99-point car. Car collectors rate the condition of their cars  on a 100-point scale, with the highest 99 points. The difference between a  99-point and a 90-point car may be minor, but the difference in price will not  be. And a 99-point car can be maintained in pristine condition for only a year  or two before it starts to deteriorate from oxidation.     -- Save 10% for expenses. Every old car needs something.     -- Go topless. Convertibles are more expensive to buy but appreciate faster.     -- Buy from the Sun Belt. Most cars from inland California or the Carolinas,  from Arizona and Texas, usually have not been exposed to road salt or coastal  condensation.     -- Buy originals. A Ferrari with a Chevy engine might be cheaper, but it's not  as good an investment as a car with all the proper parts. Most collectors,  especially Corvette and Porsche owners, are almost fanatical about having  matching serial numbers for the chassis and engine.     -- Buy classic car insurance. One great saving in collector cars is insurance.  As long as you own at least one car for each member of the household to use as  everyday transportation, you can insure your collector car for surprisingly  little.     -- Study up. Becoming knowledgeable in this market is a lot more fun than  studying cocoa futures. Classic Motorbooks, Box 1, Osceola, WI 54020,  catalogues thousands of books about automobiles.

High-quality blue chips such as Duesenbergs will always be in demand, while  there are high-risk automobiles that are currently overlooked but ought to be  in great demand in the future.    All experts agree that vintage racing cars in all price ranges are the hottest  collector-car category today and will be for the foreseeable future. A group of  experts offer these tips on car collecting:     -- Don't buy a car to restore. Restoring an old car is more difficult and  often more expensive than restoring an old house, and it's easy to get ripped  off.     -- Don't buy a 99-point car. Car collectors rate the condition of their cars  on a 100-point scale, with the highest 99 points. The difference between a  99-point and a 90-point car may be minor, but the difference in price will not  be. And a 99-point car can be maintained in pristine condition for only a year  or two before it starts to deteriorate from oxidation.     -- Save 10% for expenses. Every old car needs something.     -- Go topless. Convertibles are more expensive to buy but appreciate faster.     -- Buy from the Sun Belt. Most cars from inland California or the Carolinas,  from Arizona and Texas, usually have not been exposed to road salt or coastal  condensation.     -- Buy originals. A Ferrari with a Chevy engine might be cheaper, but it's not  as good an investment as a car with all the proper parts. Most collectors,  especially Corvette and Porsche owners, are almost fanatical about having  matching serial numbers for the chassis and engine.     -- Buy classic car insurance. One great saving in collector cars is insurance.  As long as you own at least one car for each member of the household to use as  everyday transportation, you can insure your collector car for surprisingly  little.     -- Study up. Becoming knowledgeable in this market is a lot more fun than  studying cocoa futures. Classic Motorbooks, Box 1, Osceola, WI 54020,  catalogues thousands of books about automobiles.      Wire    "

0,FT932-1502 ,"FT932-1502 _AN-DFWCJAFGFT 930623   FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: GM to shift capacity back to US      By MARTIN DICKSON      NEW YORK   GENERAL MOTORS begins crucial talks today on a new three-year labour contract with the United Auto Workers' union - but in a much improved atmosphere, helped by a GM announcement that it is moving some car production from Mexico to the US. Detroit's other two big motor manufacturers - Ford and Chrysler - also face contract negotiations this summer, but GM's are potentially the most difficult because it faces more serious financial problems in North America than its rivals, while its labour relations have been traditionally worse than theirs. However, Mr Jack Smith, chief executive of GM since last autumn, has been trying hard to ameliorate the distrust between the company and the UAW - including taking the unusual step of leading the GM team when talks open today. In a significant move on Monday, he also announced GM was to shift production of 70,000 to 100,000 units annually of its Chevrolet Cavalier sub-compact car from a plant in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, to Lansing, Michigan, next year. The move will create between 800 and 1,000 jobs in Lansing, which will be filled, at least in part, by laid-off GM workers. In return, GM has won from the UAW an agreement at the Lansing plant which should ensure much greater labour flexibility and productivity. The agreement, hailed by both the union and management as a example of sensible co-operation, should also give a boost to proponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement, bringing together the US, Mexico and Canada. NAFTA is facing a tough battle in the US Congress for ratification, with opponents arguing it would involve a large loss of American jobs to Mexico's cheaper labour market. However, GM's move is likely to be used to demonstrate that job movement will not be all one-way. The Cavaliers being moved to Lansing are earmarked for the US and Canadian markets. GM says the shift should not mean any job losses in Mexico, with Cavalier production expanding to meet growing local demands and GM considering building a new small car at Ramos Arizpe for the Mexican market. GM does not manufacture a small car in Mexico, where this section of the market is dominated by Volkswagen and Nissan. Mr Stephen Yokich, the chief UAW negotiator at GM, said he believed this was the first time a US motor manufacturer had moved production out of Mexico to the US. Praising Mr Smith, he said that 'since he took over as CEO we have had more talk and more working together than we have had in the history of GM and the UAW.' Still, the contract talks will be heavy weather. The Big Three will be seeking greater labour flexibility and lower health and pension liabilities, while the union will be trying to maintain benefits and prevent job losses. After initial negotiations, the union traditionally selects one of the Big Three as its prime target and then tries to impose the settlement reached with this company on the other two. Many analysts believe GM is the likeliest target for this so-called 'pattern bargaining'.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT934-12912 ,"FT934-12912 _AN-DJYCQAADFT 931025   FT  25 OCT 93 / VW opts for four-day week in move to cut wage costs      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest volume car maker, plans to introduce a four-day working week in its six German plants next year with the aim of cutting its wages bill by about 20 per cent. The proposal will be approved at a board meeting today, against a backdrop of gloomy forecasts for motor industry sales and of the company's failure to meet its target of breaking even this year. Four-day working is almost unheard of in German industry. That it is being introduced at such an important company is another clear indication that German trade unions are becoming increasingly amenable to flexible working practices under the influence of the worst recession since the second world war. Although workers will work four days, the factories will continue to produce for five days a week at reduced capacity. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, industry associations and the Bundesbank have all demanded increasing flexibility from employers and employees to avoid unemployment's reaching levels that might endanger the 'social peace'. Unemployment in Wolfsburg, where VW is based, is at present about 13 per cent of the local workforce. There are few alternative industrial suppliers in the town. The group expects sales of Volkswagen brand vehicles to stagnate in 1994 at this year's level of 1.4m vehicles, compared with 1.66m in 1992. Its Spanish workers were told last Friday that 9,000 jobs - 40 per cent of the total payroll - were to be lost at Seat, and one of the company's three factories was to be closed. In Germany, management is bound by an agreement with the government of Lower Saxony, its largest shareholder, and the company's workers councils, to limit job cuts to the 18,000 agreed last winter, when Mr Ferdinand Piech became chairman. That foresaw a domestic workforce of 100,000 by the end of 1994. Union officials said last week that the payroll had already been reduced to 108,000, and would be down to 103,000 by the end of this year. A nominal four-day week would allow the introduction of more flexible working, and the rapid reintroduction of longer hours if demand improved, a VW spokesman said yesterday. The project has been developed by Peter Hartz, VW's labour director since October. Volkswagen's employment needs are also being reduced by the efficiency improvements introduced since the arrival of the group's controversial production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. New working methods have already increased productivity by 23 per cent, company officials said at the weekend. The impact on incomes of a basic 20 per cent pay cut in the pay bill would be softened by lower tax obligations, and possibly by spreading the payment of traditional Christmas and holiday bonuses over the full 12 months. Board and senior management salaries have been frozen at VW for the next 12 months; middle-managers are to have a 2 per cent rise; and a previously-agreed 3.5 per cent pay increase for hourly-paid workers will take effect on November 1.

Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, the Briton brought in by GM last year to head Sweden's traditional rival to Volvo, declined to make a firm forecast, warning that the gloomy outlook in world car markets, especially in Europe, where sales have slumped 17 per cent this year, continued to cloud Saab's prospects. But, he added, 'I prefer to say that we have brought down the break-even point for the company to about 80,000 units sold per year and we intend to sell significantly more than that next year. So if nothing else changes we should be in the black next year.' Mr Butler-Wheelhouse acknowledged that the success of the new 900, which will compete against the Mercedes C class, the BMW 3-series and the Audi 80, was vital for Saab, which in the past four years has accumulated losses of more than SKr10bn (Dollars 1.25bn) and swallowed a further SKr8bn in two capital injections by GM and its Swedish co-owner, Saab-Scania. He insisted that Saab was not in a 'do or die' position. He said even if sales did not hit the high levels Saab hoped for, the company had the funds and the support of GM and Saab-Scania to continue to develop its next new model, an upgrade of the luxury 9000 car, due within five years. Mr John Fleming, marketing chief, said Saab had set a sales target of 45,000 cars in the first year for the 900. The new car is a complete re-vamp of the old 900 based on many Opel/Vauxhall components but with a distinctive body styling and additional engineering to give it a clear Saab identity. Saab said the new model cost SKr4.5bn and took 3 1/2 years to develop. Savings from the link with GM were put at 30 per cent. Mr Fleming said the car would be priced slightly below its main rivals. The chief worry for Saab is the steep decline in its main markets. It sold only 35,800 cars in first half of the year, compared with 86,800 in all of 1992 and 109,500 in 1989. Sales in the US - its biggest market - and Europe were down nearly 30 per cent. In Sweden, Saab is battling against a slump which has seen overall car sales fall from a peak of 340,000 in 1988 to an expected 130,000 this year. The 900 will sell hard on Saab's commitment to safety and low exhaust emissions as well as performance. In Sweden cars will be fitted with a 'black box' to record vital data in crashes, an idea widely canvassed in the UK. The two-litre turbo model, one of four engine types ranging from a two-litre, four-cylinder standard engine up to a 2.5-litre V6, will offer a so-called 'sensonic' automatic clutch operating by touching the gear lever.

0,FT941-2635 ,"FT941-2635 _AN-ECTARACQFT 940319   FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: Air clears around Bugatti - Cash call plans are forcing the carmaker into the open      By KEVIN DONE   Bugatti International, which last year took over Group Lotus, the UK sports car maker and automotive engineering consultancy from General Motors, is seeking outside finance to fund the next stage of its ambitious expansion plan. Ownership of the Luxembourg-registered company has been a mystery since it was formed in the late-1980s to revive the famous pre-war racing marque. The veil of secrecy is being lifted, however, as it prepares to bring in outside investors. The company claims it is 100 per cent-owned by the Artioli family led by Mr Romano Artioli, a 61-year-old Italian entrepreneur, who for a decade held the distribution franchise for Ferrari in the lucrative regions of north-east Italy and southern Germany. This relationship ended in 1988. Mr Artioli holds the importer/distributorship for Suzuki vehicles in Italy, and controls a separate holding company, Fisico, with interests in vehicle retailing, import/distribution and components. Mr Mario Barbieri, vice-chairman of Bugatti Automobili, said the Artioli family had a combined annual turnover of more than L300bn (Dollars 179m). Fisico also held a 20 per cent stake in the Monfalcone car terminal, a port development near Trieste, which opened last autumn to develop car transport between southern Europe and east Asia. When Bugatti International emerged last summer as the buyer of Group Lotus it admitted only that Mr Artioli held an 18 per cent stake in Bugatti Automobili, the car division, which has built a factory at Campogalliano, near Modena, to assemble the Pounds 200,000 Bugatti EB110 supercar. The balance in the car operation was owned by Bugatti International. Some big French corporations - including Michelin, Elf Aquitaine and Aerospatiale - collaborated in the development of the 212mph EB110, and there was some indication they might have backed the venture financially. Officially, however, the shareholders remained anonymous. The company said this week Mr Artioli had been the majority shareholder in Bugatti International, the master company, from the outset in 1987. Artioli family holdings now had 100 per cent of the equity. Wild rumours have swirled around the European auto industry about the ownership of Bugatti since late-1991, when the EB110 was first unveiled. Reality was lost in talk about the sums of money being pumped into the development of the 550bhp supercar, built to outperform rivals from Ferrari, Jaguar and Lamborghini. The company is now trying to clear the air ahead of a partial public flotation or a private placement of shares. CS First Boston has been taken on board as financial adviser, and Price Waterhouse has been appointed auditor for both the Italian and UK businesses. Lotus, which was forced to stop production of its Elan sports car in 1992 because of heavy losses, is now working on an ambitious product development programme. Engineering contracts were being won from leading vehicle makers that had previously been unwilling to use Lotus under GM ownership because of fears over confidentiality, said Mr Barbieri. According to Bugatti, Group Lotus had a turnover of Dollars 53m last year. It suffered a loss of Dollars 6.4m in the first eight months under GM ownership.   Companies:-  Bugatti International.

0,FT934-5776 ,"FT934-5776 _AN-DK1ACADDFT 931127   FT  27 NOV 93 / Inland Revenue seeks order for the winding up of Nissan UK      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   The Inland Revenue has applied for a winding-up order against Nissan UK, the former importer and distributor of Nissan cars which was at the centre of Britain's biggest tax fraud. The Revenue is seeking repayment of up to Pounds 238m from NUK, controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, which it claims is the company's tax liability for a period of 17 years in which NUK's profits were understated. Earlier this year two former NUK directors were jailed for their part in the tax fraud. The High Court has appointed Mr Colin Bird and Mr Dipanka Ghosh of accountants Price Waterhouse as provisional liquidators of NUK. The appointment is only temporary, however, and the Revenue will seek on Monday in the High Court to have the arrangement extended. NUK is expected to challenge the appointment of the liquidators and the winding-up petition. It has also appealed against the assessment of its tax liabilities and maintains there are no valid grounds for the tax claim. The company, which was deprived of the lucrative Nissan franchise by Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, at the end of 1991, reported net assets of Pounds 96.6m at the end of July 1992 in its last set of audited accounts. Under the terms of their appointment, the provisional liquidators hold a neutral position with the task of locating and safeguarding the assets of NUK for the benefit of all its creditors. NUK is a subsidiary of Nissan UK Holdings, which is owned by European Motor Vehicles Corporation. EMV is registered in Panama and was established as a trust by Mr Botnar. Following the loss of the Nissan franchise, NUK said that it would 'continue as a property investment company'. Its sister company Automotive and Financial Group (AFG), which is owned through a trust in the Bahamas also established by Mr Botnar, is still one of the biggest multi-franchise UK motor retailer groups. Earlier this year Mr Michael Hunt, managing director of NUK, was jailed for eight years for his part in the NUK tax fraud. He is currently appealing against his conviction and sentence. He was convicted for conspiring to defraud the Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax by helping artificially to inflate freight charges for Nissan cars imported from Japan. When interest is added, the total loss to the public purse from the fraud was estimated to be more than Pounds 87m. His co-defendant, Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance director with the company, was sentenced to three years after admitting, before the trial, to one offence of cheating the Revenue. During the two-month trial the prosecution said the fraud was by far the largest ever perpetrated on the Revenue. The 'prime mover' behind the fraud, it alleged, was Mr Botnar. Mr Botnar has remained in Switzerland beyond the reach of UK justice since a warrant was issued for his arrest in early 1992.   Companies:-  Nissan UK Manufacturing.

Insurance Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie, with the approval of the governor,  reportedly had been set two weeks ago to order an interim assigned risk rate  increase of 85%, but decided to delay her decision until the new hearings are  complete.    Gillespie's legal counsel, Karl Rubinstein, said Monday that the 160.5% request  was excessive, but agreed that some increase is necessary.

Insurance Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie, with the approval of the governor,  reportedly had been set two weeks ago to order an interim assigned risk rate  increase of 85%, but decided to delay her decision until the new hearings are  complete.

0,FT941-9147 ,"FT941-9147 _AN-EBPC3AD3FT 940216   FT  16 FEB 94 / A sorry spectacle in Tokyo: Robert Thomson and William Dawkins examine the effects on companies and consumers of the yen's rise      By ROBERT THOMSON and WILLIAM DAWKINS   The spectacle makers of Sabae, in western Japan, have their own index for foreign exchange fluctuations. At Y110 to the dollar, they are competitive in medium-quality frames, while at Y105 they must retreat to the top end of the market, and at Y100 they are making spectacles at a loss. Sabae's scale applies to many Japanese manufacturers, which are reeling from the yen's rise on the foreign exchange markets over the past two trading days. The yen stood at a just about acceptable Y108.30 to the dollar as Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa flew to Washington for a summit with President Bill Clinton on Friday. Their failure to agree on a trade accord sent the yen shooting up to Y101.9 at one point in Tokyo yesterday, to close at Y102.02 to the dollar, pushing Sabae's spectacle makers close to making a loss. The hard evidence that the US wants to push the yen higher is thin. President Clinton did refer to 'the exchange rate factor' twice at his press conference with Mr Hosokawa. But on both occasions he cited it only as one of the 'objective criteria' that the US was seeking to judge progress in opening Japanese markets over a period of years. However, the apparently non-judgmental reference to the currency was otherwise construed by the foreign exchange traders late on Friday and again by the broader markets on Monday. This prompted the Treasury on Monday to issue a statement timed for the opening of the Tokyo markets yesterday that 'we do not believe in artificially manipulating exchange rates'. Nowhere in the annual report of the Council of Economic Advisers, released on Monday, is there a single word on the desired value of the yen. Indeed US officials point out that a higher yen will tend further to deflate the Japanese economy, whereas the general thrust of US policy is to encourage Japan to cut taxes and thus stimulate growth. If anything, they say, currently weak Japanese economic fundamentals ought to push the currency lower. On the other side of the equation, the US accepts that the yen's strength has aided US car and semiconductor makers, which are gaining world market share at the expense of Japanese competitors. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association says Japan will lose its position as the world's largest car producer to the US this year, for the first time since 1979. Yen appreciation is still the big worry in Japanese boardrooms, from Sabae's small companies to Tokyo's multinationals. Nomura Research Institute estimates that the Y10 rise in the currency's rate against the dollar since early January has wiped 6 per cent off companies' average operating profits. If the yen stays this high, it could destroy corporate Japan's chance of pulling out of a four-year profits decline in 1994, warns the institute. Japanese consumers are, of course, helped by the yen's increase - but only in the short term. A stronger yen has meant some cheaper imported goods. This, plus the slowdown in economic activity, will help wholesale prices fall by 1 per cent in the year to the end of March, forecasts indicate. This does not always show up in retail prices, because the complex distribution system, with layer-upon-layer of wholesalers and distributors, soaks up most of the benefits. Even so, Tokyo shops this winter are full of discount sales. Over the long term, the yen's strength is encouraging two trends: the shift of production outside Japan, which has increased fears about rising unemployment and hence depressed consumer spending; and the weakening of traditionally close links between retailers and manufacturers. Investment in China is gathering pace among manufacturers looking for cheaper east Asian production sites. China is increasingly the preferred investment site for Japanese manufacturers, as it offers an expanding home market and a relatively cheap base for exports, according to the Export-Import Bank of Japan. Japanese direct investment overseas will fall by 6.4 per cent in the year from April, but investment in east Asia has been 'spurred by the abrupt appreciation' of the yen, says the bank. A strong yen is one extra, unwanted cost for Japanese manufacturers, already attempting to cope with a long-term decline in their profitability. Falling sales at home have put pressure on companies to find new ways of hiding excess employees in affiliates. But the common response to the profits decline, investing abroad, means that capital spending flows to, say, the northern Chinese city of Dalian, instead of the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. New factories established in Hokkaido fell from 277 in 1989 to 170 in 1992, and only 48 were commissioned in the first half of last year. In northern China, the statistics are more impressive. Mr Suehiro Ohba, general manager of a Japanese-run industrial park in Dalian, presided over the signing of four contracts in a week late last year. 'The labour here is cheap. As long as you have control over the venture, there is not much difference in the production quality between Dalian and Japan, but there is a big difference in the cost.' The Japan Research Institute - Sumitomo Bank's research unit - estimates that over the next five years the transfer of production from Japan will cost 1.1m jobs. Most markets observers expect the yen's strength to ensure double-digit growth in Japan's foreign investment for the next few years. For example, Japan's imports of audio-visual electronics were 37 per cent higher in November, compared with the same month in 1992, with most of this equipment carrying a Japanese brand-mark from the makers' east Asian factories. Japan became a net importer of televisions last year, for the first time since the second world war. Offshore production of consumer electronics in Asia has not necessarily meant cheaper prices in Japan: the Fair Trade Commission, an anti-monopoly body, has warned makers against forming industry agreements, common until last year, to restrict discounts and cushion margins. However, the second main long-term effect of the higher yen - the impact on retailing - has resulted in some clearer benefits for consumers. It has spurred the development of stores operating outside the usual distribution system, which are able to pass on the savings created both by their own lower costs and by the yen's effect on imports. In the consumer electronics industry, manufacturers rely on the loyalty of small retailers tied to their own group, through Japan's networks of cross-shareholdings and exclusive dealerships. But these mainly small corner stores are under pressure from independent retailers willing to cut prices to attract business. A similar trend is emerging in the food and clothing industries. Mr Takashi Shirayama, of Shirayama Corporation, an Osaka-based investment company, has plans for at least five retail outlets, the first likely to open in March, which he said could undercut supermarkets by 20-30 per cent. 'If you have five stores, you have more import buying power,' Mr Shirayama said. It is harder, however, to get around the reluctance of power utilities to pass on the savings from the fall in the cost of energy, most of which is imported. The utilities still calculate energy costs at rates similar to those set in 1989, when the yen was Y124 to the dollar, the currency in which oil is priced. Tokyo Electric Power and the other regional utilities reduced rates in November after complaints from consumers and pressure from the government, but the average Tokyo household is still saving only Y111 on a Y7,010 monthly electricity bill. The result has been increasing numbers of Japanese worried that there are so few gains from a high yen. Their disappointment with derisory cuts in electricity bills may have been been offset by the attraction of cheaper holidays abroad: record crowds at Narita airport over the new year holiday were no doubt delighted with the chance of a cheap sunshine break. But on balance, the yen's rise is a further constraint on the recovery of an economy already in the grip of deflation. Additional reporting by Jurek Martin   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

The profits of the big three US carmakers are rising sharply, helped by the continuing strength of the US market and the start of recovery in Europe. Chrysler recently announced record quarterly earnings of Dollars 956m for the second quarter, and General Motors is expected to report a big jump in profits today. Ford's group net profit in the first six months virtually doubled to Dollars 2.62bn from Dollars 1.35bn, while turnover rose 14.2 per cent to Dollars 64.2bn. The net profits of its worldwide automotive operations quadrupled in the first six months to Dollars 2.14bn (Dollars 571m). In the second quarter Ford's automotive operations tripled net profits to Dollars 1.18bn from Dollars 395m. The after-tax return on automotive sales jumped to 4.2 per cent from 1.7 per cent. Net income from Ford's US automotive operations rose in the second quarter to Dollars 907m from Dollars 367m. Automotive earnings outside the US increased to Dollars 276m from only Dollars 28m, helped by a return to profit in Europe. Ford's financial services group, one of the most profitable financial services companies in the world, earned a record Dollars 528m (Dollars 380m) in the second quarter. Group turnover worldwide in the second quarter rose 15 per cent to Dollars 33.8bn (Dollars 29.4bn), while Ford vehicle sales increased by 8.1 per cent to 1.8m. Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We feel good about these improvements, but we are by no means satisfied.' The group, which has launched a far-reaching reorganisation aimed at merging its North American and European automotive operations into one unit by the end of the year, had to remain focused on improving its return on automotive sales, he said. The sharp rise in profits at Ford, following big losses in 1991 and 1992, is being supported by increasing demand for new vehicles in the US, where overall sales of cars and light trucks jumped 11 per cent in the first half of the year to 7.76m. Ford forecast that total US car and truck sales in 1994 would rise by about 9 per cent to 15.5m. Its share of the US market declined slightly in the first half to 24.9 per cent from 25.4 per cent a year ago. The profitability of Ford's US automotive operations has been helped by falling marketing costs with its retail incentives reduced to Dollars 550 per vehicle in the second quarter from Dollars 755 a year ago. Ford has reduced the share of vehicles it sells to fleets to 25 per cent of its total sales in the second quarter from 28 per cent a year ago, and the mix of its sales is improving with a rising share of sales of more profitable light trucks.

0,FT941-11265 ,"FT941-11265 _AN-EBFAAAAGFT 940205   FT  05 FEB 94 / Honda's technology controls threaten Rover deal      By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and JOHN GRIFFITHS      TOKYO, LONDON   A tense poker game over the future of Rover Group was developing yesterday between the company's Japanese partner, Honda, and BMW, the German carmaker which has agreed to buy the British group for Pounds 800m. New uncertainty over the controversial deal, which left Honda bitterly angry, emerged as it became clear that the Japanese company retains a stranglehold over some of Rover's key models, including the new 600. Far frombeing an outraged but helpless bystander at the sale of the British partner, with which it has developed close ties over 15 years, it is understood that Honda has tight licensing agreements with Rover that place strict limits on the use the British company may make of the technology used in its most successful models. Should Honda, which still retains 20 per cent of the British carmaker, decide to end the partnership, Rover could be obliged to stop production of the key 600 and 400 ranges as well as its own 2-litre engines within three months, or at least until they could be expensively re-engineered to remove licensed Honda components. BMW, which carried out its inspection of the Rover groupbefore authorising the Pounds 800m investment in an unusually short time by motor industry standards, said yesterday it was aware of the potentially problematic licensing agreements. BMW executives also acknowledged that a Honda pull-outwould inflict enormous damage on Rover. But the company is proceeding with the purchase in the apparent belief that the loss to Honda of an estimated Pounds 400m annual revenue from parts sales and other elements of the collaboration will prevent the Japanese company from taking the step. 'If they think that, theyreally are gambling,' retorted a spokesman for Honda Motor Europe. BMWreceived some comfort from Honda yesterday when Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president, insisted that his company was not seeking to precipitate an immediate crisis. He brushed aside suggestions that Honda's relationship with Rover was over and said the company would consider any proposals from BMW. However, he believed Honda's relationship with Rover was unlikely to come to an end overnight. Both companies are still manoeuvring to gain the maximum advantage from this latest shake-up in the motor industry. Rumours that Honda was preparing a counter-offer to the BMW deal played a part in the sharp rise yesterday in the shares of Rover's parent company, BAe, helped by news ofa Pounds 250m decks-clearing write-off on its turboprop leasing business. By last night Honda had denied any prospect of a counter-offer. 'It is our principle that Rover, which is the last UK car company, should be controlled mainly by British people,' Mr Kawamoto stressed in explaining why Honda decided against buying outright the UK carmaker. Mr Kawamoto, making Honda's first substantive response to the intended takeover - which has still to be approved by BAe shareholders - said Honda had been approached by BAe with the possibility of buying the company but had turned down the offer. 'We are notin the position to take the initiative on Rover so we would like, first of all,to hear what (BMW) have to say,' Mr Kawamoto noted. 'There are so many possibilities, we cannot make any decisions about our relationship with Rover until wehear from BMW.' Takingthe rough with the smooth, Page 6   Companies:-  Rover Group.

The company said there was no reason to suggest that the job of production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, was in doubt. General Motors, his previous employer, has accused Mr Lopez of carrying out industrial espionage. The meeting is due to begin at 5pm GMT tomorrow. News of an extraordinary sitting of the supervisory board came shortly after a statement from VW yesterday that it is to cut a further 3,000 jobs in Germany by the end of 1994. Earlier this year, the company said it intended to reduce the payroll at its six domestic plants by 12,500. More than 5,000 workers have gone since then, and a further 10,000 jobs will disappear in the next 17 months. Analysts said the group faced a loss of at least DM700m (Pounds 272m) this year, as VW executives continued to back away from their earlier, persistent claims that it would break even despite a first-quarter deficit of DM1.25bn. Observers calculate turnover could fall by 10 per cent this year, while VW's own profit forecasts are based on a decline of 5 per cent - a target which company officials describe privately as 'over-optimistic'. 'It is clear that our earnings forecast cannot be attained if the drop in sales is larger,' Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, said in an interview. With his own confident forecasts in doubt while Mr Lopez and three members of his new cost-cutting team are under criminal investigation, Mr Piech faces increasing pressure. He drew fire last week from politicians and business leaders for a clumsy attack on GM with xenophobic overtones. His attempts to fight back in what he calls a 'war' with GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel led to accusations that he was damaging Germany's reputation. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, intervened personally with an offer to mediate. The VW supervisory board, including representatives of Germany's leading banks, unions and the state of Lower Saxony, which owns almost 20 per cent, has so far been solidly behind Mr Piech and his team. A recent meeting between a small group of management and supervisory board directors decided that it would withdraw support for Mr Lopez only if he were ultimately found guilty. Mr Piech, who has unequivocally bound his fate to that of his Spanish colleague, is expected to tell the meeting tomorrow evening of Mr Lopez's 'stupendous performance' so far. On Tuesday, Mr Klaus Volkert, representing the Volkswagen workforce, said he would withdraw his backing if charges seemed likely against Mr Lopez. The group's North American subsidiary said yesterday sales of Volkswagen cars in the US last month were down 46 per cent on July last year. With total deliveries to customers of 25,000 vehicles, sales in the first seven months of the year had fallen 48 per cent. Mercedes-Benz said its July sales in the US were up 45 per cent. In the year to the end of last month sales were down 12.6 per cent at 34,590.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Mercedes-Benz.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.     USZ  United States of America.

0,FT942-5774 ,"FT942-5774 _AN-EFCDVAHCFT 940602   FT  02 JUN 94 / VW pressure on Madrid over Seat funding      By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and DAVID WHITE      HAMBURG, MADRID   Volkswagen said yesterday it hoped to end talks with the Madrid government 'in the next two weeks' to clear the way for further restructuring at Seat, its loss-making Spanish subsidiary. The company said it wanted Spain to contribute DM820m (Dollars 500m) to fund redundancies at Seat. It claimed there were 'positive signals' that the government would make funds available and a further meeting was scheduled for next week. However, in Madrid, the industry ministry said it would only be willing to pump more money into the Barcelona-based car company for new development projects. The government also argues that its scope for providing help is limited by European Union rules. Mr Juan Ignacio Molto, secretary of state for industry, told VW representatives on Tuesday the government was not prepared to fund redundancy packages. Excess labour was 'a problem for private sector management'. However, the Spanish authorities are anxious to see Seat maintained as a separate company within the VW group. The regional government of Catalonia, also under pressure to assist the loss-making company, has criticised Madrid for delay in resolving the issue. Meanwhile, VW announced that it had had 'positive results' at company and group level in April and May but would not give details of profits. The company has already said it hopes to improve on its 1993 profit of DM71m at company level this year and to break even at group level following a loss of DM1.4bn last year. Worldwide deliveries in the first five months rose 6.1 per cent over the year before to total 1.4m units. Germany was the only market where deliveries fell - by 4.1 per cent - a fact VW blamed on weak demand there generally and poor sales at Audi. Several shareholders were angry that the VW management had not foreseen the DM1.84bn losses at Seat last year but there was broad support among the 3,500 shareholders for Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the VW production chief at the centre of suspicions about industrial espionage. Both Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chief executive, and Mr Klaus Liesen, the chairman of the supervisory board, made impromptu comments after prepared speeches, reflecting the anger about Opel allegations in the days before the annual meeting. 'There is up to now no evidence which would justify the charge of industrial espionage,' Mr Liesen told applauding shareholders. Mr Piech, in turn, denied all suggestion that Mr Lopez would move to Seat. Seat lost DM350m in the first quarter of this year and VW hopes the group will end the year with a loss of around DM1bn, compared with a loss of DM1.84bn in 1993. The company is expected to become profitable again in 1995. Mr Piech said there were two solutions at Seat. A 'friendly' one would be to leave Seat as an independent subsidiary. A more drastic alternative would involve merging Seat with other VW operations, leaving only an independent sales unit. It has asked the Spanish government to fund the redundancy of older workers, who are entitled to three years' redundancy payment which will cost about DM820m. Otherwise, VW says it will spend DM160m to shed the same number of younger workers.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Torismo.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0,FT933-4777 ,"FT933-4777 _AN-DIGCFAE7FT 930907   FT  07 SEP 93 / The Renault-Volvo Merger: Gyllenhammar set to play the role of a champion      By HUGH CARNEGY   FOR Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who has led Volvo for 22 years, yesterday's merger with Renault was something of a paradox. On one side, the deal is the consummation of an alliance that reflects Mr Gyllenhammar's long-cultivated role of industrial statesman and vociferous advocate of Sweden's need to move closer to the rest of Europe. Already decorated with the Legion d'Honneur and a fluent French speaker, he will revel in his position as the figurehead of a European automotive giant. But there is also the less glorious side: for the merger amounts to an admission by a man committed to preserving Sweden's industrial strength that Volvo, the country's best known manufacturing company, can no longer compete on its own. Words he penned in 1986, when Volvo was in its heyday, now look painfully outdated. 'My hope is that Volvo will remain a strong enterprise - that it will never have to seek help from outside. It is the most important thing,' he wrote in a book about the company. PG, as he is universally known in Sweden, will doubtless shrug off such awkward echoes from the past. Since he took over from his father-in-law, Mr Gunnar Engellau, as Volvo managing director in 1971 at the age of 36, he has rarely been out of the public eye in Sweden, evoking both admiration and irritation among his reticent compatriots for his outspoken and ambitious stewardship of the group. A former chief of the insurance company Skandia, Mr Gyllenhammar has presided over two decades of growth at Volvo in which its cars have achieved an international reputation for safety and utility - and lately even performance. But his restless search for new horizons has over the years also led Volvo in strange directions. In the late 1970s, successive attempts to merge with Saab-Scania, Volvo's great domestic rival owned by the Wallenberg family, to sell a 40 per cent shareholding in the group to the Norwegian government in return for North Sea oil rights and to persuade the Swedish government to invest SKr1bn in the company flared and then died. A decade later, Volvo was riding high as one of the world's most profitable carmakers. Mr Gyllenhammar, who in 1990 moved from the position of chief executive to the role of executive chairman, won plaudits for his pioneering of new 'humane' production techniques that sought to replace the traditional assembly line with team-based assembly systems. Recession in the 1990s, however, exposed how far Volvo had slipped in international competitiveness and the new plants were closed, with thousands of Swedish workers laid off as losses mounted. Mr Gyllenhammar's advocacy of international partnerships as the way forward for Swedish companies was vindicated, but in Volvo's case with more of a defensive character than he surely originally intended. Now, the automotive heart of Volvo will take its place as a junior partner in the new company, with 'PG' no doubt playing a high-profile role as a champion of the Swedish contribution to the alliance.

0,FT944-7794 ,"FT944-7794 _AN-EKWECADCFT 941123   FT  23 NOV 94 / Designers stress their proletarian credentials      By TONY WALKER   Music blared, pretty girls provided decoration, and the covering was slowly removed from a vehicle on an elevated stage. Porsche was unveiling its prototype of the family car its designers hope will capture the hearts of Chinese bureaucrats and consumers, writes Tony Walker. The German sports carmaker could not be accused of under-selling its wares in the competition to participate in China's 'people's car' project. It has developed the prototype C88 (Concept 88 car) especially for the Chinese market, with styling that embraces such features as headlights with oriental characteristics. Porsche - which makes fewer than 20,000 cars a year - was very much the outsider among the world's car giants exhibiting at last week's small-car show in Beijing. The company wants to supply basic design and engineering assistance to a Chinese manufacturer in return for a fee or royalty on models produced. Its representatives emphasised that Ferdinand Porsche designed and built the first Volkswagen in the mid-1930s - Germany's 'people's car' and the prototype for 21m 'Beetles'. Also trying to persuade the Chinese of the importance of a long track record was Ford Motor Company. It invoked Henry's name and that of the Model-T - the world's first mass-produced vehicle. 'All great endeavours begin with a vision,' said Mr Wayne Booker, Ford's executive vice-president for international operations. 'Ninety-one years ago, Henry Ford had a vision of providing the greatest good for the greatest number of people . . . From that beginning Ford has adhered to the vision of serving working people.' It was not clear whether this appeal to the proletarian instincts of Chinese officialdom made much impact. But the announcement by Mercedes-Benz that it was prepared to invest up to DM2bn (Pounds 800m) in a new plant producing 250,000 FCC (Family Car China) concept cars a year would have been welcome. Mercedes-Benz's squat, snub-nosed prototype was not the most elegant vehicle on display. But it attracted attention from both Chinese consumers and international competitors, who were curious about the German luxury car producer's ideas of what might sell in a mass market. Mercedes-Benz executives were proud of the FCC's innovative design, which incorporates alternative propulsion options, such as electric or hydrogen drive. They also claimed outstanding fuel efficiency, with the 1.3 litre petrol engine capable of 800km on a single tank. Participants in the show admired the Chinese for enticing the world's top carmakers to Beijing. But there was a hint of exasperation that, because of the huge potential of the China market, the Chinese clearly had the 'upper hand', as one Japanese representative said. 'They are very good merchants,' he said. 'They are taking full advantage of the situation to let us know they are the masters, and that they are calling the shots.' Chinese visitors to the exhibition were mostly 'window-shoppers'. Economic reforms are bringing the possibility of purchasing cars within range of many Chinese, but the price tag on a 'people's car' at this stage would be beyond the means of most. 'You have to be rich to buy a car,' said Miss Shen, who was viewing the Mercedes prototype. 'I'm dreaming of owning a car, but I'll have to wait . . . till next century, perhaps.'

The  agreement will be implemented in March and Brazilian  entrepreneurs say problems will probably begin to get serious  within three or four years. The entrepreneurs explained that  the Mexicans will have to streamline their industries and  improve their competitiveness in various areas. Nearly one  fifth of Brazilian exports are sent to the United States.    Spare-part manufacturers are studying possible associations  with Mexican companies. Textile industries are investing in new  technology. Orange juice and shoe producers are seeking new  markets in other areas, among them the EC and Mercosur [Common  Market of the South].    Claudio Vaz -- the president of the Vehicles Spare-Parts and  Components Industry Union, Sindipecas -- said Brazilian  companies may lose more than their markets, they might also lose  investments if U.S. head offices spend the funds assigned for  their Brazilian branches in Mexico.    For this reason Vaz wants to close some industrial  cooperation agreements with Mexican companies before March, as  it was done in Argentina. Of the total exports of spare parts  producers, 38 percent -- or $871 million worth -- go to the  United States, the largest importer of Brazilian spare parts.  Mexico, meanwhile, takes 11 percent, or $250 million worth.  Vaz anticipates the industry will export at least 10 percent  more this year, and total sales are estimated to reach $2.5  billion.    According to news that leaked out last week, the Mangels  company, a wheel manufacturer, is planning to invest nearly $15  million in the purchase of a U.S. company. Directors of the  company believe the deal is the best way to increase its  competitiveness when NAFTA starts operating.    Orange juice exporters believe NAFTA is just one more reason  for companies to seek new markets. Orange juice producers  export nearly 30 percent of their total output to the United  States. At the beginning of the 1980's, orange juice exports to  the United States represented 50 percent of the industry total  output but for some time now producers have increased their  sales to European countries.    Orange juice entrepreneurs believe the United States will  always be an important Brazilian orange juice client. One  Brazilian exporter said orange plantations in Mexico are not  well developed and their processing methods need to improve. He  added that the quality of the Brazilian product has been tested  and approved by the U.S. market.    Another factor favoring Brazil is low production cost.  Brazil spends a lot less on labor, irrigation, and drainage. A  box of orange costs nearly $1 in Brazil. In the United States  the same box costs at least $2.20.    Sebastiao Burbulhan, president,of the Sao Paulo State Shoe  Industry Union, has said that shoe exporters will also invest  more in new markets, such as the Mercosur market. The largest  share of their exports -- 69.3 percent of the $2 billion  exported annually -- go to the United States. Burbulhan said  the industry is most concerned about U.S. threats of sanctions  due to the problem of patents. ""Sales enquiries are less  frequent,"" Burbulhan said.    The textile industry is also preparing to face competition  from Mexican products. Luis Americo Medeiros, president of the  Sao Paulo State Textile Industry Union, has said that last year  companies invested $600 million in importing machinery and  equipment.     "

Kakar, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, was imprisoned and tortured for more than a  year in Kabul, the Afghan capital, for opposing the Soviet invasion in 1979.  Five years ago, she fled with her husband and seven children and started  schools for Afghan refugee girls in this Pakistani border town.    She teaches them that, even in Islam, women have rights -- all the more so  because of the role Afghan women have played in the guerrilla war against the  Soviets.    Last week, as the rebels were on the verge of victory after forcing the  withdrawal of Soviet troops, Kakar got her reward -- a death threat.      Half a Dozen Warnings    It came from one of the fundamentalist parties in the moujahedeen rebel  alliance, and it was one of half a dozen letters she has received warning her  to stop teaching the refugee girls that Islam does not require them to wear the  burkha, the customary head-to-foot dress.    ""This is the last warning we are going to give you,"" the letter said. ""If you  do not accept this custom, we are going to kill you.""    The incident not only underscores the deep ideological divisions among the  rebels, it also points up the dilemma facing the millions of Afghan refugee  women who have been changed by the war and face the prospect of going home to a  country where the change will not be welcome. Indeed, the fundamentalist  Islamic regime that is expected to take over in Afghanistan will offer women  less freedom than the one that drove them out.    ""We women have fought hard for the freedom of our people and our nation,"" Kakar  said angrily, folding the warning letter. ""We have been imprisoned and  tortured. Some of us have been killed. And we have been the shield for the men  who carried on this holy war.      Push for Rights    ""Now that Afghanistan is returning to the people, why don't they think about  women's rights? The women helped fight the holy war, and now they don't care  about us.""    ""They"" are two fervently fundamentalist political parties in the seven-party  rebel alliance that Pakistan and the United States helped organize as a conduit  for billions of dollars in arms and other supplies.    More than half of the weapons are known to have gone to the most fundamentalist  of the seven party leaders, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, in part because the late  Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq wanted to form a fundamentalist Islamic belt  from Iran to India.    As a consequence, Hekmatyar has become a powerful force in the rebel alliance  -- a force that has met with increasing criticism from many of the 3 million  Afghan refugees in camps in Pakistan.    Opposition to Hekmatyar was largely responsible for the collapse Friday of a  rebel leaders' conference here to form a government to replace the  Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. Kakar opposed the conference, for example,  because the fundamentalist-dominated alliance refused to allocate a single seat  to the women.      Devout Muslims    She said that she and most other Afghans are devout Muslims but that the  religion practiced for centuries in the villages of Afghanistan has few of the  trappings of the modern fundamentalism that Hekmatyar advocates.    Another party leader, Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, is backed by Saudi Arabia and is  identified with the Wahabbi sect of Islam. Many refugees view his prominent  position in the rebel alliance as evidence of foreign ideology encroaching on  traditional Afghan culture.    Asked who had sent her the threatening letter, Kakar replied: ""It is signed  'students,' but they are Gulbuddin and Sayyaf people. It is very clear. They  believe that women have no role in the future society in Afghanistan.""      Years of Imprisonment    She pointed toward a woman sitting nearby, Mina Azizi, who is 23 but looks a  decade older. Azizi has spent the last seven years in prisons in Kabul. At 15,  she was imprisoned for a year at the headquarters of the Afghan secret police,  known as Khad, after she was caught with rebel documents while acting as a  courier.    Removing her sunglasses, Azizi showed that she was barely able to open her left  eye, which looks in a different direction from her swollen right eye.    ""They used electric shocks and forced her eyelids open in bright light for days  at a time,"" Kakar said. ""She needs many eye operations. But the (rebel  political) parties will not let her into their hospitals here. None of these  parties will help her, and it is only because she is a woman.""    Aid workers from the United Nations and independent foreign agencies working  with the refugees confirmed that women are largely ignored by the rebel  alliance. They have been given less freedom in the refugee camps here than they  had in their villages, and they receive much less food and care than the men.      100,000 War Widows    One aid worker said that more than 100,000 of the refugees are war widows and  that the women's sacrifices in the war have been greater than the men's.    ""They have lost husbands, children, entire families,"" the aid worker said. ""And  still, when they arrive here, they say their role in this war is to have more  children, more sons, more holy warriors to carry on this crusade.    ""But after many years in the camps, these women have changed. It's true that  some of the parties have ignored them, but through the international agencies  working here, they have been exposed to education, many of them for the first  time. They have been told they have rights, and for them to go back to a  fundamentalist society now just will not work.""    Kakar makes the same argument.    ""What we have been teaching these women is that the holy war is like a bird,""  she said. ""A bird when it flies needs two wings. A holy war also needs two  wings. One is the man, one is the woman. And a bird, like this holy war, cannot  fly very well with only one wing.""      Clearly Dangerous    Such ideas, and the fact that Kakar does not hesitate to make them public, are  clearly dangerous.    Other refugee leaders and intellectuals have also been threatened. One of the  most outspoken was killed in Peshawar a year ago.    But when a reporter volunteered to withhold Kakar's name to protect her, she  would have none of it.    ""No, I am not afraid of these things,"" she said, half-smiling. ""I am a good  Muslim, and my faith teaches me that the only one who can save us is God. The  only one who can kill us is God.    ""When I was in prison, the Russians always said, 'We will kill you if you do  not cooperate.' I said to them then, 'Only God can kill me,' and I say the same  to these people now.

The two companies are to form a joint venture incorporated in Switzerland in which Mercedes-Benz will hold a 51 per cent stake and SMH, the maker of Swatch watches, 49 per cent. The combination of the prestigious German luxury carmaker and SMH, the company which masterminded the rescue of the Swiss watch industry with the development of the high quality, low-price Swatch, is unprecedented in the world automotive industry. The two groups are aiming to open up an entirely new segment at the bottom of the car market for a two-seater urban micro car that would be only 2.5m long (significantly shorter than the 3.05m Rover Mini) allowing it to be parked in congested cities head-on to the pavement in the gap between other parked cars. It is expected to cost less than DM20,000 (Dollars 11,739). Mercedes-Benz disclosed yesterday that it had been working on concepts for a micro city car since the early 1980s. It unveiled yesterday two prototype micro compact cars that have been designed and developed at its California design studio. The expertise of the Swiss watchmaker, which has been working for more than three years on its own Swatchmobile project for an environmentally friendly city car, is chiefly in the development of a hybrid electric/petrol propulsion system, in micro-electronics, low cost modular production, and in the marketing of high volume low-cost fashion products, like the Swatch. Mr Nicolas Hayek, chairman of SMH (Ste Suisse Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie) and the creator of the Swatch revolution in the world watch industry, said the joint venture would aim to sell the micro city car worldwide. The name of the new car and the possible distribution channels were still to be developed by the joint venture, said Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz. A separate franchise would be created which could use both the Mercedes-Benz and the Swatch names. Mercedes-Benz's decision to press ahead with the development of a micro city car comes only a few months after its announcement that it planned to develop a small four-passenger car sized between a Ford Fiesta and a Volkswagen Golf. A concept small car, the Vision A-93, was unveiled last year, and the small car - to be sold under the Mercedes star - is scheduled to enter production at Mercedes-Benz's Rastatt plant in south-west Germany in 1997 with a volume of up to 200,000 cars a year. Mr Jurgen Hubbert, director of the car division, said that a production version of the micro car would be around 2.5m long and 1.4m wide. The car would be high to create inside space. There would be room for two passengers and some luggage and the car would meet all the safety and emissions standards of larger cars. The short but high shape of the car will allow the engine and gearbox to be positioned under the passenger compartment. Mercedes-Benz is aiming at a top speed of 140kph for the micro car, a range of 500km and acceleration of zero to 100kph in 13-14 seconds. Petrol, electric and hybrid propulsion systems are possible.   Companies:-  Mercedes-Benz.     SMH Societe Suisse de Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie.

VW, which is losing money heavily, is planning to reduce the number of basic chassis platforms which are used to produce its range of cars from 16 to just four by the next decade. The strategy will embrace all four makes in the group - Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda - and will eventually have a big impact on its manufacturing operations in Germany, Spain, the Czech Republic, Brazil, Mexico, China and South Africa. It will hold the key in the long term to VW overcoming its unenviable position as the high-cost producer in the European and world car industry. Volkswagen, led by Mr Ferdinand Piech, the controversial management board chairman appointed 14 months ago, has sought in the short term to stem losses by a harsh mixture of deep cuts in capital spending, a sharp reduction in the workforce and the introduction in Germany of a four-day week with corresponding cuts in pay. He has also imposed a squeeze on components suppliers to reduce purchasing costs. If the strategy is applied as rigidly as planned by Mr Piech and Professor Ulrich Seiffert, group research and development director, it will spell the end for production of the Beetle, assembled in Mexico and Brazil. It will also rule out development of new products such as a micro-compact car, like the two-seater city car prototype unveiled by Mercedes-Benz last week which would call for an additional platform. Prof Seiffert said the VW group's four car platforms (excluding light commercial vehicles and the multipurpose vehicle under development with Ford of Europe) would consist of: the AO platform for small cars, which will form the basis of the new generation VW Polo, due for launch in the autumn, and will later spawn derivatives to replace cars such as the Skoda Favorit and the Seat Ibiza launched last year. VW's planned low-price small four-seater car due for production in 1996-97 would be based on a shortened version of the AO platform. the A platform for lower medium cars, which will provide the base for the next VW Golf, a second Skoda range, a new small car for Audi (A2), and a Seat Toledo replacement. the B platform for upper medium and executive cars, which will spawn replacements for the Audi 80 (A4) and 100 (A6) and the next VW Passat. the D platform for the aluminium-bodied Audi A8 luxury car. In a separate move, VW is increasing its stake in VAG Sverige, its Swedish importer and subsidiary of Saab-Scania, the Swedish truck and aerospace group. It is expected to raise its holding to 50 per cent from one-third and to increase representation on the six-man board from two to three. VAG Sverige is the importer and distributor for VW, Audi and Seat cars in Sweden and had sales last year of 19,200 units with turnover of DM765m. Volkswagen has increased holdings in its main distributors in Europe, and now controls distribution in its main markets of Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Spain.

Speculation is mounting that, as an early development, state prosecutors investigating possible criminal charges will make a formal statement later this week on inquiries so far. The decision by a Hamburg civil court to loosen reporting restrictions imposed last month on Der Spiegel, Germany's leading news weekly, will re-open the public debate on claims by General Motors of the US and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel, that Mr Lopez, a former GM director, and several of his associates who joined VW with him, took industrial secrets with them to the German group. After yesterday's ruling, which followed an open hearing last Thursday, the magazine can resume reporting on its earlier claims that Mr Lopez took boxes of secrets with him when he quit GM in March. It may also pursue its charges that Mr Jose Manuel Gutierrez, a close associate of Mr Lopez who followed his former GM chief to VW almost immediately, asked for and was given 'strictly confidential' details of a new GM diesel engine. The court, which imposed a gagging order at VW's request last month after the publication of two detailed articles, also lifted the injunction in regard to a claim that Mr Lopez had 'reached an agreement' to join VW with Mr Ferdinand Piech, at the start of this year. In an affidavit presented in court last week, and signed by Mr Piech, the VW chairman stated that Mr Lopez decided to move on March 9. The court also received testimony that Mr Lopez had in effect written a speech, intended to explain to GM employees why he had decided not to join VW, which was not in the event delivered. After checking the final draft on the morning of March 15, he left the US for Germany. Mr Lopez stated in an affidavit presented last Thursday that he did not write it, and that it had been written by 'GM'. Mr Lopez and VW were represented at the hearing by a single lawyer while Der Spiegel had more than 20 witnesses, all GM employees, on hand to support its case. although only three were called. All the claims on which the court loosened the gag yesterday have been firmly and consistently denied by VW and its executives, although as Mr Harald Ficus, presiding judge, said last week, his court was not the place for deciding the truth or otherwise of the suspicions aired in Der Spiegel. However, Volkswagen was obliged to bear most of the costs of the case. In German courts apportionment of costs shows the extent to which the parties involved have gained or lost, according to legal experts. On the single issue of Der Spiegel's reports on the diesel engine secrets, Mr Gutierrez was made responsible for the whole DM100,000 (Pounds 38,759) in costs. In another case, which concerned complaints made in the German group's name  -including Mr Piech's claims on the planning and timing of Mr Lopez's switch - VW was obliged to pay two-thirds of the DM500,000 costs.

The delegation included  officials of the Trade Ministry and the adviser on economics of  the Romanian Embassy in Lithuania, Dan Tiron, who is also a  trade representative of Romania in Estonia and Latvia. The  agreement was signed on Friday in the Foreign Ministry.    The previous years were marked by a sensible decrease of  barter between the two countries which makes up only some  several hundred thousands lats. The new deal provides the most  favoured nation treatment in trade between both countries. It  means a remarkable reduction of rates of duties from both sides.  According to the forecast by the state Minister of Foreign  Trade and E.U.

The tourist-oriented island -- 86% of which is preserved by a nonprofit  conservancy in its natural state -- has virtually no heavy industry.

0,FT944-18234 ,"FT944-18234 _AN-EJDDVAHYFT 941004   FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (24): Rising imports cause anxiety - Brazil      By PATRICK MCCURRY   Tumbling car prices triggered by tax cuts and improved productivity are unleashing pent-up demand in Brazil, which was the fastest-growing big market for vehicles last year. Despite this good news, locally-based manufacturers are worried about the rise in imports, as well as a continuing productivity gap with foreign competitors, some of which are considering whether to move production to Brazil. After averaging 800,000-900,000 vehicles a year in the 1980s, Brazil's manufacturers churned out nearly 1.4m vehicles last year, up 30 per cent on the year before. This made the industry Latin America's biggest producer and No 10 globally. Production this year is likely to approach 1.6m vehicles. Exports within the Mercosur common market, which comes into force on January 1 and will include Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, may also increase. Last year Brazil exported 218,000 vehicles to Argentina compared with 83,000 in 1991. The Mercosur countries are negotiating a transitional agreement for the car industry, which will cover rules on regional content and a common external tariff. Companies are investing to standardise and integrate production between Brazilian and Argentine plants. However, some analysts believe that the overvaluation of Brazil's new currency, the Real, and Argentine worries about its trade deficit raise uncertainties about vehicle exports to Argentina in the future. Brazilian car executives believe the big growth potential is in the local market where there are just five cars per 100 inhabitants compared with 11 in Argentina and 30 in Europe. Domestic demand has grown as local car makers have had to compete since the economy was opened up at the beginning of the decade. This cut tariffs and imported vehicles have grown from 15,000 in 1991 to a likely 120,000 vehicles this year, forcing local manufacturers to improve productivity and quality. Productivity at Fiat, General Motors and Autolatina, the holding company for the joint operations of Ford and Volkswagen, has increased by an average 17 per cent a year this decade due to higher volumes combined with a reduced workforce and the contracting out of services. Quality has also improved, with defects falling by 50 per cent over the period, according to a report by consultants Booz-Allen earlier this year. More importantly, agreements between the government and the industry since 1992 have cut taxes and profit margins. Taxes have fallen by an average 22 per cent, leading to a dramatic fall in prices, particularly for 1,000cc cars where the reductions were concentrated. The price of VW's 1,000cc Gol car has fallen from Dollars 13,000 to just over Dollars 7,000 in the past three years, says Pierre Alain de Smedt, Autolatina chairman. But there could be problems ahead for Brazil's manufacturers. Despite the productivity gains, they are still 10 per cent less efficient than Europeans and further behind the Japanese, says Booz-Allen. Thanks to the growing local market, they face the threat that competitors who are now importing cars could start to produce in Brazil. Nissan and Toyota are thought to be planning investments. The companies are also concerned about the rise in imports and are calling for quotas to be imposed, which the government has so far refused. They argue that, despite the tax cuts, Brazilian vehicles are still overburdened compared with foreign cars.   Countries:-  BRZ  Brazil, South America.

0,FT934-17455 ,"FT934-17455 _AN-DJAC3AAXFT 931001   FT  01 OCT 93 / Angry workers vow to fight job cuts      By TOM BURNS      BARCELONA   ONE thing that really irritates workers at Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of Volkswagen, is that the parent German group even brought in soil when it built a new plant at Martorell, 35 kilometres west of the old Seat factory at Barcelona. 'VW changed the Spanish washroom taps at Martorell to German ones and laid down German earth for the gardens,' Mr Inocencio Jaramillo, a Seat union organiser, said yesterday at the main plant in Barcelona. He and the other 12,000 workers could soon be out of a job. The gleaming Martorell plant, opened earlier this year following a Pta244bn (Pounds 1.2bn) investment, was supposed to be the symbol of VW's future in Spain. The Barcelona factory, now more than 40 years old, is the obsolete symbol that VW would prefer to forget. Although the German group has not specified the closure of the Barcelona plant, it has indicated it wants stringent cuts in its loss-making Spanish subsidiary. It was the failure to deliver such cuts that led to the resignation of Seat's chairman, Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, on Wednesday. Few at Seat doubt that the cuts mean the curtain will come down on the old plant but the Barcelona workers are quietly confident that their cause is not yet lost. 'VW simply cannot do it,' said Mr Jaramillo, a neatly dressed clerical worker who held court, surrounded by boiler-suited colleagues, in the basement offices set aside for union activities in the plant's main administration building. A group of Mr Jaramillo's colleagues were travelling yesterday to the VW headquarters at Wolfsburg for meetings with chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech. 'If he (Mr Piech) wants to close us down, he will be firmly told it is quite impossible. We represent a political cost that neither Volkswagen nor the Spanish government can pay for.' The quiet determination, however, masks a very real fear that the writing is indeed on the wall. The Barcelona plant was condemned just as soon as Martorell, with a labour force of 6,500, came on stream. Closure of Barcelona is such an emotional issue it can hardly be faced. The employees who crammed into the basement office have been with Seat almost from the start. At least half the Barcelona labour force is over 50 and all feel proprietorial about the company. 'If we go, it is the end of Seat as a company, as a trade mark, as an identity,' said 'Tomasn', who is a veteran, like Mr Jaramillo, of more than 20 years with the car manufacturer. 'From now on it will be just Volkwagen, perhaps that is what the Germans always intended.' Closure of the plant, which occupies a square kilometre of an industrial estate called the Zona Franca (freeport), south of the city, is also a stunning blow to Barcelona. 'We are the lungs of the Zona Franca, we keep it going,' said Mr Jaramillo. 'Some 40,000 indirect jobs will be affected by our closure.' If Seat, by far the largest employer on the estate, shuts down there will be extreme nervousness at neighbouring plants operated by Nissan and by a subsidiary of Fiat, both of which are making heavy losses. Seat's Barcelona workers promise 'strong, very strong, action', if the closure is forced through. At the very least they will bring Martorell to a 'standstill'.

0,FT934-5888 ,"FT934-5888 _AN-DK1ACACEFT 931127   FT  27 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volkswagen heads for DM2bn loss      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      WOLFSBURG   Volkswagen, Europe's leading carmaker, is heading for a DM2bn (Dollars 1.1bn) loss this year, Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, admitted yesterday. Group capital spending budgets are to be cut by an average DM2bn annually over the next five years to help recovery. At the same time, VW aims to save around DM3.6bn in wage costs over the next two years with the introduction of a four-day working week in Germany, Mr Piech said. But he gave no indication of when he expected the group, which includes the VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat brands, to return to profit. The group made a net profit of DM147m in 1992. The parent company, VW AG, would break even this year after a profit of more than DM400m in 1992, Mr Piech said. The predicted recovery had quickly run out of steam, the company said. Group results were hit by 'unplanned' losses at Audi, deficits in the Asia Pacific region and North America and the 'extremely critical' developments at the Spanish subsidiary, Seat. Mr Piech, who until midsummer was confidently forecasting the group would be turned round this year after an 87 per cent profits dive in 1992, placed most of the blame for the slide into the red on events at Seat. Continuing negotiations with Spanish union and government officials on the closure of Seat's Barcelona factory and the loss of 9,000 jobs there, gave ground for 'the greatest concern', Mr Piech said. The group planned to spend DM600m on restructuring the Spanish business, adding to the burdens of the DM1.25bn loss already announced, and a planned DM1.5bm cash injection to save it from collapse. VW's rolling five-year capital investment programme in the automotive business, already reduced from DM50bn to DM45bn earlier this year, will be cut to just DM35bn for the period to the end of 1998, officials said. Spending on the financial services divisions is to be cut from DM34bn to DM30.5bn. VW also claimed yesterday that independent investigations had found no proof to support suspicions of industrial espionage against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the ex-General Motors director who joined VW last March. But an abbreviated version of a report by auditors KPMG Deutsche Treuhand, distributed yesterday, said investigators had failed fully to clarify the events in late March when, according to VW, 20 cartons of Mr Lopez's 'personal' papers were shredded on his orders. Carefully-worded VW statements said no evidence had been found that 'secret' data from GM or Adam Opel, the US group's German subsidiary, had been 'available or used' at the company. Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, yesterday accused VW of 'diversionary manoeuvres' and manipulating and confusing public opinion. In a statement prepared on the basis of recent selective leaks from the KPMG report, he said VW was trying to mislead the public by acting as a judge in its own matter. Mr Herman pointed to Mr Lopez's contradictory sworn statements and criminal investigations against him, and said the VW board had known for some time that he and his followers - despite denials - 'actually had cartons of material moved to Wolfsburg'. VW yesterday would not answer questions relating to the suspected theft of GM or Opel secrets by Mr Lopez or his colleagues.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

0," FR940921-0-00095   FR940921-0-00016        45. Section 86.10696 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:         86.10696    Equipment required; overview.         (a) This subpart contains procedures for exhaust emissions tests on petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and for evaporative emission tests on gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Certain items of equipment are not necessary for a particular test,     e.g.,     evaporative enclosure when testing petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. Alternate sampling systems may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator. Equipment required and specifications are as follows:     (1)     Evaporative emission tests.     The evaporative emission test is closely related to and connected with the exhaust emission test. All vehicles tested for evaporative emissions must undergo testing according to the test sequences described in 86.13096; however, the Administrator may omit measurement of exhaust emissions to test for evaporative emissions. The Administrator may truncate a test after any valid emission measurement without affecting the validity of the test. Further, unless the evaporative emission test is waived by the Administrator under 86.09026, all vehicles must undergo both tests. (Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from the evaporative emission standard.) Section 86.107 specifies the necessary equipment.     (2)     Exhaust emission tests.     All vehicles subject to this subpart are subject to testing for both gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions using the CVS concept (see 86.109), except where exemptions or waivers are expressly provided in subpart A of this part. Vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' (i.e., phase-out) standards described under subpart A of this part are exempted from testing for methane emissions. Otto-cycle vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' standards are waived from testing for particulates. For vehicles waived from the requirement for measuring particulate emissions, use of a dilution tunnel is not required (see 86.109). The CVS must be connected to the dilution tunnel if particulate emission sampling is required (see 86.110). Petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicle testing requires that a PDP-CVS or CFV-CVS with heat exchanger be used. (This equipment may be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles; however, particulates need not be measured for vehicles that are waived from the requirement). All vehicles equipped with evaporative canisters are preconditioned by loading the canisters with hydrocarbon vapors. Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from this requirement.

Section 86.10696 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:         86.10696    Equipment required; overview.         (a) This subpart contains procedures for exhaust emissions tests on petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and for evaporative emission tests on gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Certain items of equipment are not necessary for a particular test,     e.g.,     evaporative enclosure when testing petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. Alternate sampling systems may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator. Equipment required and specifications are as follows:     (1)     Evaporative emission tests.     The evaporative emission test is closely related to and connected with the exhaust emission test. All vehicles tested for evaporative emissions must undergo testing according to the test sequences described in 86.13096; however, the Administrator may omit measurement of exhaust emissions to test for evaporative emissions. The Administrator may truncate a test after any valid emission measurement without affecting the validity of the test. Further, unless the evaporative emission test is waived by the Administrator under 86.09026, all vehicles must undergo both tests. (Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from the evaporative emission standard.) Section 86.107 specifies the necessary equipment.     (2)     Exhaust emission tests.     All vehicles subject to this subpart are subject to testing for both gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions using the CVS concept (see 86.109), except where exemptions or waivers are expressly provided in subpart A of this part. Vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' (i.e., phase-out) standards described under subpart A of this part are exempted from testing for methane emissions. Otto-cycle vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' standards are waived from testing for particulates. For vehicles waived from the requirement for measuring particulate emissions, use of a dilution tunnel is not required (see 86.109). The CVS must be connected to the dilution tunnel if particulate emission sampling is required (see 86.110). Petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicle testing requires that a PDP-CVS or CFV-CVS with heat exchanger be used. (This equipment may be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles; however, particulates need not be measured for vehicles that are waived from the requirement). All vehicles equipped with evaporative canisters are preconditioned by loading the canisters with hydrocarbon vapors. Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from this requirement.     (3)     Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications.     Fuel specifications for exhaust and evaporative emissions testing and for mileage accumulation are specified in 86.113. Analytical gases are specified in 86.114.

The  documents were signed by the two foreign ministers during a  ceremony attended by Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy  and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at Government  Palace.    The other cooperation agreements refer to the economy,  natural resources, the environment, health, the duty free  warehouse in Villeta, and tourism issues.    All these agreements were signed during the last visit  President Wasmosy made to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, some  months ago.    Stolen Vehicles    According to the agreement on the recovery of stolen  vehicles, the two countries promise a smooth exchange of  information between their respective police forces regarding the  owners of the vehicles, the reports of theft to the police, and  details of the stolen vehicles.    The accord also establishes the need for a document  certifying that the vehicle has not been reported as stolen and  listing the highways and checkpoints which the vehicle is  authorized to use.    Other preventive measures mentioned in the agreement refer  to  constant patrolling, checking of vehicles, and the establishment  of consultation offices in both countries in their respective  police stations.    Establishment of Grounds for the Construction of a Gas  Pipeline    The agreement for the supply of Bolivian natural gas to  Paraguay is partial, although of an ""indefinite duration"" and  for a volume yet to be determined.    The two countries have agreed to authorize the construction  and operation of a gas pipeline between the two countries, as  well as for the transportation of gas within their own  territories.    The purchase of gas will be made through operators who will  be in charge of the negotiations and of establishing the price,  deadlines, volume, and other pertinent details. Payments will  be made in dollars.    Economic Cooperation    The economic cooperation agreement is basically designed to  step up economic and commercial relations through the  elimination of non-tariff barriers on bilateral trade, and to  promote the expansion and diversification of trade between the  two countries.    Natural Resources    As for the agreement referring to natural resources and  environment, it provides for the exchange of technicians,  professors, and experts for the drafting of joint programs as  well as the exchange of information regarding methods and  techniques.    Tourism Cooperation    The tourism cooperation agreement, among other issues,  provides for regional and subregional integration, the  coordination of promotion events, the consolidation of  integrated tourism circuits, the identification and  consolidation of a land and river corridor between the two  countries, as well as the promotion of integrated tourist  circuits in the international markets.    Villeta Duty Free Warehouse    The two ministers also signed an agreement for the exchange  of reversal notes authorizing the rendering of services for  cargo in transit, for Bolivian cargo in transit and to the  Paraguayan market, and for Paraguayan cargo bound for Bolivia.  The Bolivian Government has offered the Paraguayan Government a  duty free warehouse and storage area in a site yet to be chosen,  under the same terms granted by Paraguay to Bolivia.    Health    The cooperation agreement in this field is designed to  establish an exchange of knowledge and experience, to step up  the training of human resources, establish an information  service on the activities held on the border areas, and adopt  regular notification mechanisms on illnesses that must be  reported.

As of September 30, 1994, there were 2,411 individuals participating in the vision waiver study. Unless the agency acts on the D.C.

Generally, a truck driver's ability to operate is demonstrated by possession of a currently valid commercial driver's license or other authorized license, and based upon other safety-related information pertaining to the type of vehicle to be operated. A commercial driver's license or other authorized license is issued after subjecting the driver to knowledge and performance tests usually administered in the course of a few hours. Some employers may add a performance test, or a safe driving probationary period before permanent employment. How safely the driver may operate thereafter is based on compliance with traffic laws and regulations and involvement in accidents.     The drivers accepted for the waiver study had to meet the licensing requirement of their States and any employer-mandated prerequisites, in addition to demonstrating beforehand a safe driving record for three years as required by the Vision Waiver Program.     By allowing these drivers to continue to drive under a waiver program, i.e., in effect, grandfathering them, the FHWA placed itself in the position of receiving information on the relationship between visual capacity and the ability to operate a CMV safely. Because they did not meet existing vision standards, these drivers could not be allowed to operate in interstate commerce, unless they obtained waivers. The Court acknowledged that ``this approach may be entirely reasonable,'' but it found that the FHWA lacked data to support the conclusion that the conditions it imposed on the granting of waivers assured consistency with the safe operation of CMVs.     In order to revalidate the waivers, and to remain consistent with the Court's remand, the FHWA is relying upon several research studies demonstrating the effectiveness of methods to ascertain the probability of an individual experiencing accidents in the future based on accident history.

Subsequent studies, building on that model, concluded that accident rates for the same individual exposed to certain risks for two different time periods vary only slightly.

0,FT934-10488 ,"FT934-10488 _AN-DKEC2ABGFT 931105   FT  05 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan carmakers in slow lane to China - A huge market beckons      By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO   JAPAN's carmakers owe much of their impressive growth in the past to the efforts they put into building up markets abroad. But, in spite of the setback they face at home and in western markets, Japanese carmakers have been curiously slow to move into one thriving market that is not only geographically close but which offers strong growth for the foreseeable future. China's growing demand for passenger cars has so far failed to attract much investment from its Asian neighbour which could risk falling behind western rivals in the race to win over one of the fastest growing markets in the world. In a bid to make up for lost time, next Sunday the Japanese government and car industry are sending a joint mission to China which they hope will help pave the way for stronger ties. The mission of over 60 members representing all the large Japanese car and car components makers and bureaucrats from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, is the first of its kind to China. It will be headed by Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and of Nissan. The official reason for the visit is to exchange views on industrial policy, possible future co-operation and other bilateral issues. The Japanese are keen to get to know their Chinese counterparts in industry and government and to get a better picture of China's policy regarding its car market. China feels that Japan has not been eager to invest in their car industry, says a Miti official. 'But that is not the case. Because Japan is close to China, their expectations are high,' he explains. While western companies from Volkswagen to Chrysler have been setting up manufacturing joint ventures in China, large Japanese makers have been conspicuously absent from the eight car manufacturing projects given official blessing of China's government. Of the three large-car and three small-car projects approved by the Chinese authorities, only Suzuki has set up a joint venture for mini-car production. Daihatsu and Fuji Heavy, meanwhile, have formed technology transfer agreements. The potential for growth in Chinese car ownership is huge. The market is expected to grow from 1.1m units last year to 3m units by the year 2000, according to Chinese estimates. Exports of Japanese vehicles to China have surged from 20,673 in 1990 to 96,953 last year. In the first few months of this year, exports rose from 7,940 units in January to 21,044 in March. And Japan already has six commercial vehicle joint ventures and two technology transfer accords with China. However, the Japanese are finding China's market managing measures irritating. One Miti official laments that 'their basic policy is to build the cars themselves.' Industry officials complain about political uncertainty and limited infrastructure. They are also finding it difficult to swallow the terms set by the Chinese. Partly as a result of these hurdles, the large Japanese companies find their interest in new markets diverted to South East Asia, where motorisation is far more advanced than in China. With Japanese vehicle exports to China having fallen dramatically as a result of moves to cool the economy, the mission will be looking for any way to bridge the gap.

REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A Bonita motorcyclist charged with killing a woman jogger by running over her  was not licensed to operate a motorcycle, a state Department of Motor Vehicles  employee said Tuesday.    Jerald Covey, 29, was charged with vehicular manslaughter in the Nov. 5 death  of Stephanie Rossi, 29, a Bonita nurse who police say was hit head-on while  jogging on Sweetwater Road. California Highway Patrol spokesman Lance Mino said  Rossi died at the scene.    Covey, who is scheduled to appear in South Bay Municipal Court on Nov. 21, was  arrested at the scene, Mino said. The suspect is free on his own recognizance.    A DMV records clerk said Tuesday that Covey ""has a clean record,"" but is not  licensed to operate a motorcycle. The only California license issued to Covey  was for non-commercial motor vehicles, she said.    Although the CHP is still investigating the accident, Covey's arrest and  subsequent release stirred considerable argument and some finger-pointing  between the CHP and the district attorney's office.    Investigators put the time of the accident at 4:45 p.m. According to Steve  Casey, spokesman for Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, Covey was taken to Scripps  Hospital in Chula Vista by paramedics and arrived at about 5:20 p.m. Covey was  not accompanied by a CHP officer, Casey said, and walked away from the  hospital.    He was discovered missing at about 5:55 p.m. and was not arrested again until  about 9 p.m., when he returned home. Prosecutors were disturbed by Covey's  departure from the hospital, Casey said.    ""It is my understanding that, once an individual is placed under arrest, that  individual is not shipped off to some other destination but remains in the  custody of law enforcement at all times, even in a hospital,"" Casey said.    Mino declined to respond to Casey's comment, saying that a final report on the  incident will not be available until later this week.    CHP officials also revealed that Covey was not given a blood-alcohol test until  ""two or three hours"" after the accident. At the time of his arrest, Covey was  charged with murder, felony hit-and-run, felony drunk driving and resisting  arrest. But the murder charge was later reduced to vehicular manslaughter and  the other charges were dropped, Mino said.    On Tuesday, Mino said investigators are still awaiting the results of Covey's  blood-alcohol test, but argued that the delay in administering the test will  not hamper the CHP's efforts to pursue a drunk-driving charge against Covey.    ""All indications show alcohol in his system,"" he said, without elaborating.    Sharp differences also arose between prosecutors and CHP officials when a CHP  spokesman charged that the district attorney's office downplayed Rossi's death  and failed to arraign Covey within 48 hours, as required by law.    ""We're not interested in engaging in second-guessing, but the fact is that the  CHP accident report was incomplete,"" Casey said. ""The (prosecutor) who reviewed  the report determined there wasn't enough information there to pursue a  prosecution.""    Casey added that it was CHP officials who later reduced the murder charge to  vehicular manslaughter.    Mino attempted to smooth over the differences between the two law enforcement  agencies.    ""We've got somebody working on it full time, completing the questions that the  district attorney has directed to us. We will have all that information  available when the final report is in. . . . We're making sure that everything  is complete,"" said Mino.    Rossi's husband, Tom Rossi, has also criticized the CHP investigation, Mino  acknowledged.    ""We have contacted the family and assured them that we're doing everything  possible to complete the investigation,"" said Mino.    Tom Rossi could not be reached for comment.

For the entire month, with import sales included, car and truck sales rose 8.4%  compared to August of last year. Domestic vehicles showed a significant gain.    Vehicles made by the eight major U.S. auto makers sold at an average rate of  49,276 a day during the Aug. 21-31 period this year, compared to a daily rate  of 40,578 during the same time last year.    Domestic car sales were up 22.6%, and truck sales were up 19.4% in late August.  For the month, domestic vehicle sales were up 13.1%, while import car and truck  sales were down 4.8%.    August was a good month to buy cars. Typically, dealers offer special deals as  the model year draws to a close, traditionally on Sept. 30. Besides that,  manufacturers have been offering customers and dealers incentives that lower  the prices of 1989 cars.    Consumers also were told that prices for 1990 cars would be going up, prompting  some to buy now rather than later.    ""Consumers have been bombarded by these price hikes on the 1990 models going up  anywhere from 2% to 9%,"" said analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co.  International of New York.

For the entire month, with import sales included, car and truck sales rose 8.4%  compared to August of last year. Domestic vehicles showed a significant gain.    Vehicles made by the eight major U.S. auto makers sold at an average rate of  49,276 a day during the Aug. 21-31 period this year, compared to a daily rate  of 40,578 during the same time last year.    Domestic car sales were up 22.6%, and truck sales were up 19.4% in late August.  For the month, domestic vehicle sales were up 13.1%, while import car and truck  sales were down 4.8%.    August was a good month to buy cars. Typically, dealers offer special deals as  the model year draws to a close, traditionally on Sept. 30. Besides that,  manufacturers have been offering customers and dealers incentives that lower  the prices of 1989 cars.    Consumers also were told that prices for 1990 cars would be going up, prompting  some to buy now rather than later.    ""Consumers have been bombarded by these price hikes on the 1990 models going up  anywhere from 2% to 9%,"" said analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co.  International of New York.

0,FT933-6193 ,"FT933-6193 _AN-DH2AOAEPFT 930828   FT  28 AUG 93 / Struggling Group Lotus finds Italian saviour      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent   THE TAKEOVER of Group Lotus by Bugatti brings together two of the most famous motor racing names of the pre-war and post-war eras. Ettore Bugatti, the Italian creator of some of the world's most beautiful classic cars, died in 1947, and his car factory in France had already ceased production by the early 1950s in the aftermath of the war. In the UK Colin Chapman, the Group Lotus founder and one of the most creative and successful designers of racing cars, started his business in the early 1950s. His company has had a chequered history and never achieved a financial strength to match its success on the grand prix racing circuits. Group Lotus struggled to survive both before and after Chapman's death in 1982. It has proved to be none too secure in the hands of General Motors since 1986, and last year recorded a a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.6m on a turnover of Pounds 60.98m. General Motors was forced to put in Pounds 18m to repair the battered Lotus balance sheet in 1991, and the reverses convinced the giant carmaker that it had neither the desire nor the management resources to cope with such a small and specialised business. Group Lotus losses have grown from Pounds 2.1m in 1988 to Pounds 4.4m in 1989, Pounds 12.7m in 1990, Pounds 14.7m in 1991 and the record Pounds 36.6m last year. However, in the past 12 months General Motors has been restructuring the business to ready it for disposal. Following the demise of the Elan sports car, Group Lotus has limited production to just one model, the Esprit luxury sports car, of which it is planning to build 350 this year. The workforce has been cut from 1,717 in 1990 to about 700 - a total of 500 in engineering and 200 in car production. Now the latest saviour has come from Italy in the shape of entrepreneur and life-time Bugatti lover Mr Romano Artioli, who holds an 18 per cent stake in Bugatti Automobili. He has recreated the Bugatti marque - supported by unnamed financial backers in the European automotive components industry - both as a maker of exotic and expensive cars and as a designer label for exotic and expensive fashion items, from sunglasses to table-ware. The first car of the new Bugatti company, created in 1987, was the EB110 supercar unveiled early last year with a mid-mounted 550 bhp V12 engine, carbon-fibre chassis and four-wheel drive. Production began in December and 47 have been delivered to date. Bugatti Automobili is based at Campogalliano near Modena, not far from the homes of Ferrari and Lamborghini. Mr Artioli was at one time a Ferrari dealer and is now the Suzuki distributor in Italy, but Bugatti has been his passion for 40 years. His campaign to revive the marque began in 1987 when he negotiated with the French government for the rights to the Bugatti name and badge. Ettore Bugatti was born in Italy, but the cars that made him famous were produced in Molsheim in the Alsace region of France. After his death the factory was taken over by Hispano-Suiza which eventually became part of Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace group. The Bugatti holding company is registered in Luxembourg and its shareholders remain anonymous. Some big corporations have co-operated in developing the EB110, however, including Aerospatiale, which produces the carbon-fibre monocoque chassis.   Companies:-  Group Lotus.

0,FT941-12448 ,"FT941-12448 _AN-EA3BCAE5FT 940129   FT  29 JAN 94 / Motoring: Worth every yen - Stuart Marshall predicts UK success for Mazda's latest luxury model      By STUART MARSHALL   Europe's quality car-makers have not been best pleased to hear Americans asking why they should buy another BMW or Mercedes when they can get the same quality and reliability, and lots more equipment, for less money from Japan? They are talking about the posh brands, of course: the Lexus (Toyota), Accura (Honda), Infiniti (Nissan) and Xedos (Mazda). The Lexus, in particular, has profited at Germany's expense in the US and, to a lesser extent, Europe. Can Mazda do likewise in Britain with the latest Xedos? I think it might. It will not be due to lack of ambition or product quality if it fails; this is a car on which any manufacturer would be pleased to put its badge. Whereas the Xedos 6 (this column, November 29 1993) is pitched against the BMW 3-Series, the larger Xedos 9 is targeted mainly at owners or users of the Audi 100, BMW 5-Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and, perhaps, the top end of the new C-Class. There is a very strong family resemblance between the Xedos 6 and 9. Inside and out, the styling emphasis is on curves. The body shell is galvanised and has an eight-year anti-corrosion warranty. Unlike its main rivals, which have rear-wheel drive, the 168 horsepower produced by the Xedos 9's 2.5-litre, 24-valve V6 goes to the front wheels via a silky, four-speed automatic transmission, with no manual gearbox option. But, even on wet roads, you would never know it was front-wheel driven. A traction control system - using the same electronics as the anti-lock brakes - eliminates wheel-spin and, with it, torque steer. (This is the disagreeable tugging sometimes felt through the steering of muscular front-drive cars). The Xedos 9 would take very good care of an aggressive, must-be-in-front driver because it holds the road and handles securely, whether accelerating, cornering or braking. Other users, while appreciating its excellent dynamics, would revel in the quiet, smooth way it progresses. It might sound like a back-handed compliment but I shall think of the Xedos 9 as Mazda's Lexus. Both are so tranquil that you must pay close attention to the speedometer on a motorway. The velour-trimmed seats are supportive (although not as hard as they tend to be in top-quality German cars). Tall people will discover that the Xedos 9's only real snag is a steering wheel adjustable for reach but not for tilt. If you stand over 6ft, the rim could obscure the tops of some of the instruments. Otherwise, a typical business motorist would find a Pounds 24,399 Xedos 9 difficult to fault. It is equipped lavishly. In addition to automatic transmission and traction control, the price includes air-conditioning, cruise control, driver and front passenger air bags, remote-control central locking with alarm and immobiliser, and a high-class stereo radio/tape player. Leather trim is the only optional extra. Mazda claims a top speed of 130mph (210kph) and 0-62mph (0-100kph) acceleration in 11 seconds. With a likely consumption on a journey of 26-27mpg (10.5-10.9 l/100km) and a 68-litre tank, its refuelling range is about 350 miles (560 km).   Companies:-  Mazda Motor Corp.

0,FT941-17176 ,"FT941-17176 _AN-EAFCSAAZFT 940106   FT  06 JAN 94 / Sales of new cars and trucks in US rise 8%      By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent      DETROIT   Sales of new cars and light trucks in the US rose more than 8 per cent last year to about 14.2m, the highest level since 1989, provisional industry figures show. Sales rose by 1.1m from 13.1m in 1992 and 12.5m in 1991, the low point of the last recession. The US market peaked at 16.3m in 1986. The strengthening recovery in the US new vehicle market is in stark contrast to the steep fall in demand in Europe last year and the further drop in new vehicle sales in Japan, where demand has fallen for three years in succession. The increase in sales in the US has been driven by the surge in demand for light trucks, such as pick-ups, mini-vans (multi-purpose vehicles), vans and four-wheel-drive sports/utility vehicles, now accounting for about 40 per cent of the US passenger vehicle market. Light truck sales, still dominated by the big three US vehicle makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, rose 16 per cent last year to a record 5.7m; car sales rose 4 per cent to 8.5m. US carmakers outperformed the market with a 10.4 per cent increase in new vehicle sales. Japanese carmakers have been forced to increase prices faster than their US rivals. Under pressure from the strong appreciation in the value of the yen, the Japanese have lost market share. The rapid improvement in the fortunes of the domestic US vehicle makers was led by Chrysler, smallest of the big three, which increased its total vehicle sales 19.9 per cent to 2.047m from 1.71m a year earlier. Sales of light trucks by Chrysler accounted for 59 per cent of its total sales volume last year. The company is strengthening its position with the launch of a series of new cars this year, including the Neon small car and the Chrysler Cirrus/Dodge Stratus large family cars, unveiled this week at the Detroit motor show. Chrysler, which is undertaking a rapid renewal of its product range, increased its car sales last year by 23.1 per cent to 834,132; its light truck sales rose 17.8 per cent to 1.2m. Ford also performed strongly and accounted for five of the top 10 best-selling vehicles in the US. Its full-sized F-series pick-up was the best-selling vehicle at 565,000, while the Ford Taurus was the best-selling car at 360,000, ahead of the Honda Accord at 330,000. Ford's total vehicle sales rose 12 per cent to 3.6m; its car sales increased by 6 per cent to 1.878m, while light truck sales rose 19.4 per cent to 1.68m. General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle maker, suffered another small erosion of its US market share to about 33 per cent. Its total vehicle sales rose 5.9 per cent to 4.7m. GM increased its new car sales 2 per cent to 2.93m; its truck sales rose 13 per cent to 1.79m. Honda's sales in the US fell 7.3 per cent last year to 717,000. Total vehicle sales by Toyota, including its Lexus luxury car division, increased 1.3 per cent to 1.033m. Sales of cars under the Toyota brand fell 2.1 per cent. Nissan, the second biggest Japanese car maker, recovered after falling behind its Japanese rivals in the US. Its total sales, including the Infiniti luxury car division, rose 17.9 per cent to 680,000. Japan car sales, Page 4   Companies:-  Chrysler Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

In response to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991, the agency proposed in the September notice that medium and heavy vehicles be equipped with an antilock brake system (ABS) and be able to comply with a 30 mph braking-in-a-curve test on a low coefficient of friction surface using a full brake application.         In this supplemental notice, NHTSA is proposing to amend the implementation schedule for the rule and to require independent wheel control on at least one axle. The agency's decision to issue this notice was prompted by comments on the NPRM favoring such changes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On September 28, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the agency proposed amending Standard No. 105,     Hydraulic Brake Systems     and Standard No. 121,     Air Brake Systems,     to require medium and heavy vehicles    1     to be equipped with an antilock brake system (ABS) to improve the lateral stability and control of these vehicles during braking. (58 FR 50739). The NPRM proposed supplementing the ABS requirement by including a 30 mph braking-in-a-curve test on a low coefficient of friction surface using a full brake application. The agency believed that the proposed requirements would improve heavy vehicle stability and control during braking and thus significantly reduce the deaths and injuries caused when these vehicles jackknife or otherwise lose control. The notice also proposed requiring an in-cab ABS malfunction lamp and, during a transition period of eight years, an external trailer lamp to warn drivers of non-ABS tractors of trailer ABS malfunction. The agency believed that the proposed malfunction indicators would provide valuable information about ABS malfunctioning to the driver and to maintenance and inspection personnel. The proposal was based on comments received in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) published on June 8, 1992 and other available information (57 FR 24212).              1      Such vehicles will be referred to as ``heavy vehicles'' throughout the remainder of this notice.          NHTSA received over 50 comments in response to the NPRM. These commenters included heavy vehicle manufacturers, brake manufacturers, safety advocacy groups, heavy vehicle users, trade associations, State entities, and other individuals. The majority of commenters agreed that the agency should take measures to improve the stability and control of heavy vehicles during braking to reduce the number of loss-of-control crashes. Commenters addressed specific issues raised in the NPRM, including the decision proposing to require vehicles to be equipped with ABS, the type of ABS, the braking-in-a-curve test procedure, the implementation schedule for the requirements, the malfunction indicator requirement, the power requirement, and the rulemaking's cost.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:           I. Introduction        A sizeable increase in the number of alternatively fueled motor vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), in the United States is expected. This expectation stems from initiatives by the President, Congress, State and local governments, and private interests, since these vehicles could help reduce air pollution and conserve petroleum fuel.    The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 include provisions that promote the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles. Under these Amendments, fleet vehicles sold in geographic areas with the most serious air pollution problems will be subject to emission standards that will require the use of clean fuels, including methanol and ethanol, reformulated gasoline, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and electric power.    In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) requires Federal, State, and alternative fuel provider fleets to acquire increasing percentages of alternatively fueled vehicles. The Department of Energy is in the process of initiating a rulemaking, as required by EPACT, to determine if private fleets should also be required to purchase certain percentages of alternatively fueled vehicles as part of their new fleet acquisitions.    Executive branch initiatives will also encourage the increased use of alternatively fueled vehicles. Executive Order 12844, dated April 21, 1993, directs that purchases of alternatively fueled vehicles by the Federal government by substantially increased beyond the levels required by current law. It also established the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to accelerate the commercialization and market acceptance of alternatively fueled vehicles throughout the country.    A primary impetus for introduction of large numbers of EVs in the U.S. market is a regulation of the California Air Resources Board. Similar regulations are under consideration by other States. The California regulation requires that not less than two percent of a manufacturer's sales in the State (roughly 40,000 vehicles total) must be zero emission vehicles (ZEVs), beginning in model year 1998. This requirement will increase to 10 percent or roughly 200,000 vehicles beginning in model year 2003. The definition of a ZEV is a vehicle that emits no exhaust or evaporative emission of any kind. Currently, the EV is the only vehicle which meets these requirements.    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is authorized by law (49 U.S.C. 3010130169) to regulate the safety performance of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment through the issuance of Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs). In addition, NHTSA has the authority to issue guidelines for States to use in state motor vehicle inspection programs.

Duration of Waiver; Accident and Incident Monitoring         Although the requests indicated a 2-year period for the beta test, the FHWA notes that the alpha test was delayed several times to resolve technical matters. Since all research in a field environment is likely to experience some start-up delays, the FHWA proposes to make the term of the waiver 3 years for HELP and 3 years for ADVANTAGE I75, or until the beta test is completed, whichever occurs first. This would allow for a continuous period of data collection once the programs were fully underway. If the waiver is granted, this period would begin when the FHWA publishes the final conditions of the waiver in the     Federal Register    . Motor carriers participating in ADVANTAGE I75 and HELP would be required to provide the FHWA's Office of Motor Carrier Standards with information on accidents (as defined in 390.5 of the FMCSRs) involving the vehicles equipped with the transponders. Accident reports would be required to be submitted every 6 months, and would be required to contain the information listed below:     1. A copy of all accident reports prepared and required by State or other governmental entities or insurers.     2. Interview information with the driver and occupants of the CMV involved. The information would be required to include specifically whether the driver of the transponder-equipped vehicle believed that the presence of the transponder was a factor in the accident. The interview would be required to be conducted by a motor carrier employee responsible for supervising the driver of the transponder-equipped vehicle.         IV. State and Local Laws         The FHWA strongly encourages State and local authorities with safety regulations that would prohibit the use of the proposed transponders to accept the terms of the waiver.         V. Number of Vehicles To Be Equipped With Transponders         The number of straight trucks, tractors, and motorcoaches that may be equipped with the transponders would be limited to no more than 5000 for ADVANTAGE I75 and 25,000 for HELP. The names and USDOT numbers of the motor carriers participating in the ADVANTAGE I75 and HELP programs, as well as the number of transponder-equipped CMVs operated by each carrier, would be required to be provided to the FHWA.         VI. Termination of Waiver         The transponders would be required to be removed from the CMVs participating in the ADVANTAGE I75 and HELP projects (1) upon completion of the 3-year period, or (2) upon completion of the project, or (3) when required by the FHWA either at the completion of a semi-annual review or at any time it is determined by the FHWA that the continued use of the devices decreases the safe operation of the vehicles on which they are used.       VII. Report         ADVANTAGE I75 and HELP would be required to provide separate reports at the conclusion of the program describing the transponder's installation and use. The reports would be required to include information obtained from the drivers on the device's effect on visibility through the windshield.         Request for Public Comments         The FHWA requests public comment on the proposed waiver and on the attendant conditions. Comments are also sought from State and local enforcement officials relating to their experiences with windshield-mounted electronic devices, such as those used in electronic toll-collection systems.

0,FT941-12113 ,"FT941-12113 _AN-EBADGAD6FT 940201   FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Conservative backbenchers express concern - Political Storm      By ROLAND RUDD   Many Conservative backbenchers voiced concern at the sale of Rover to BMW. Mr Simon Coombs (Swindon) urged Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister for industry, 'to learn a lesson from the fact that there is no potential British purchaser of this excellent company'. He urged the Department of Trade and Industry 'to try to work out why that is the case?'. His view was echoed by Mr John Butcher, (Coventry South West) who said many people in the Midlands were 'anxious about the sale' and wanted reassurances about the deal. Sir Teddy Taylor, (Southend East) said it was regrettable that the sale was completed without the consent of Honda, which still controls 20 per cent of Rover. He asked Mr Sainsbury to ensure the link between Honda and Rover was maintained. Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth) raised the possibility that BMW may want to build BMW cars in Rover plants. Mr Sainsbury said ownership of Rover was a low priority compared to the profitability of the company. However, worries over the foreign ownership of the last big British car company were taken up by Labour. Mr Richard Caborn, Labour's chairman of the all-party Commons trade and industry select committee asked if the government was concerned that the lack of finance going into British manufacturing 'is forcing our best companies to sell sectors off'. Mr Robin Corbett, Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington, said he was not against 'sensible partnerships' but takeovers like this had got to be bad news. 'I think it is very sad after the way management and workforce at Rover worked their socks off that British Aerospace can simply chuck them overboard because they are a bit short of money.' But MP Dennis Skinner, (Bolsover) described the deal as an outrage which would finish off the British motor industry. The government should step in and stop it, he said, adding: 'There will be no guarantees for these jobs once the Germans take over. There will be no guarantees about the Rover marque. And in a few years' time the British car industry will be gone, like the motor-cycle industry.' Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow industry spokesman, said: 'What is quite clear from today's purchase price is BMW has paid four times the amount for which this government sold Rover group only five years ago. 'That clearly confirms the Audit Office's view that the price they got for it was a rip-off of the public sector and the taxpayer.'' Mr John Carlisle (C Luton North) declared an interest in that he had sold Rover cars through his company to both sides of the House 'and indeed taken inquiries for BMW from the other side on frequent occasions'. He asked if BMW would preserve the Rover dealer network 'and make sure therefore that the excellent deals Rover have offered to members of this House and outside are still available'. Mr Sainsbury replied: 'I can assure you it is the intention of BMW that Rover will continue to offer excellent deals to all its customers, whether in this House or outside.' Pressed further by Robert Ainsworth (Coventry North East) on what guarantees BMW had given on jobs, the minister insisted: 'No company is going to invest Pounds 800m to bring a business to an end.

Ford also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.    Notice of receipt of the application was published on October 3, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 50329). This notice exempts Ford from the notification and remedy requirements of the statute.    Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, the American National Standards Institute's ``Safety Code for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z26.11977, January 26, 1977, as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that typical automotive tempered glass with a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent shall be labeled ``AS3.''    Ford manufactured approximately 1,820,000 quarter windows with a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent for use in 1986 through 1994 model year Ranger Supercab and Mazda B-series Cab Plus vehicles. These windows were labeled ``AS2'' instead of ``AS3.'' Approximately 7,900 were located and scrapped. The remaining windows were used in vehicle production or provided to aftermarket distributors for service replacement.    Ford supported its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:               [Ford believes that t]he incorrect marking presents no risk of accident or injury. The windows can be installed only as rear quarter windows in Ranger Supercab trucks; AS2 and AS3 glazing are both appropriate for these applications in accordance with Standard 205. In Ford's judgement, the mismarking is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. The stated purposes of FMVSS No. 205 are to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility of occupants being thrown through vehicle windows in collisions. As previously noted the affected quarter windows fully comply with the performance requirements of FMVSS No. 205. Because all performance requirements are met, the incorrect marking of the quarter windows has no effect upon the ability of the glazing to perform in the manner intended by the standard. Ford is not aware of any complaints, accidents, or injuries related to this condition.    The mismarking should not cause confusion in glass replacement in vehicles in service. Aftermarket distributors do not use the marking to determine which glazing is used for replacement. Rather, replacement parts are determined by service part numbers which are obtained from cataloged listings. Further, we are not aware of any confusion in aftermarket servicing of vehicles as a result of this mismarking.               No comments were received on the petition.    NHTSA has considered these arguments and has found them persuasive. Because FMVSS No. 205 permits either AS2 or AS3 glazing to be used in the rear quarter location, the use of mislabeled glazing in those areas will have no safety impact. The fact that the windows can be used only in that location and not in other locations where use of AS3 glazing would be inappropriate confirms this conclusion.    Accordingly, for the reasons expressed above, the applicant has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety, and Ford Motor Company is hereby exempted from providing notification and remedy with respect thereto.

0," LA110589-0207   130614    November 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition      Sports; Part C; Page 24; Column 1      1208 words      PREP WRAPUP;    NEW-LOOK CARSON WINS ON FINESSE; ERRATIC BANNING FALLS TO CRENSHAW      By ROB FERNAS      There's a new look to the Banning and Carson football teams as they prepare for  their annual showdown Thursday night at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach.    Banning looks uncharacteristically erratic, as evidenced by a 20-18 loss to  Crenshaw on Friday.    And Carson, once the model of hard-running football, has developed into, of all  things, a finesse team on offense.    Is nothing sacred?    Carson went to a four-receiver passing offense last year to take advantage of  the talents of quarterbacks Perry Klein and Fred Gatlin. But the Colts kept  defenses honest with a balanced attack that featured running back Errol Sapp  and an outstanding offensive line.    This season, Carson is passing out of necessity because of an inexperienced  group of running backs and offensive linemen. Through seven games, the Colts  (6-1) have passed for 1,000 more yards than they've rushed for, 1560-560.    ""There's no way we can run over teams like we used to,"" Coach Gene Vollnogle  said. ""We have to out-finesse them. We'd like to run the ball, but we're just  not physically able to do that.""    The Colts never tried to establish a running game Friday night in a 29-8  Pacific League-opening win over Dorsey at Veterans Stadium. Quarterback Armin  Youngblood came out throwing and didn't stop until he had shattered the school  record with 40 attempts.    Unfortunately for Carson, most of the passes failed to find their way to Colt  receivers. Youngblood was only 16 of 40 and was intercepted five times, setting  a rather dubious school record in the process.    But with the help of a dominating defense and the sure hands of wide receiver  Michael Ross, the Colts didn't need many completions to destroy Dorsey.  Youngblood finished with 298 yards passing and three touchdowns.    Ross became the most prolific pass receiver in Carson history with eight  catches for 205 yards and touchdowns of 71 and 29 yards. The school records set  by the senior included:    Most catches in a career, 65, breaking the old mark of 64 set by Jamie Williams  in 1982-83.    Most receiving yardage in a career, 1,266, breaking the old mark of 1,241 set  by Williams.    Most receiving yardage in a game, 205, breaking the old mark of 172 set by  Melvin Smith in 1984.    Most touchdown catches in a career, 17, tying the record shared by Wesley  Walker (1971-72) and Ron Carver (1966-67).    Most touchdown catches in a season, 10, tying the record shared by Walker  (1971) and Michael Wilson (1976).    ""I'm a little surprised,"" said Ross, when informed of his 205-yard night. ""But  I had a feeling I was close to 200. I just try to make the big plays.""    Vollnogle says Carson will be more capable of making big plays when Tydus  Winans, the Colts' other starting wide receiver, returns to the lineup. Winans  sat out his second consecutive game with a strained achilles tendon, but might  return for Thursday's 7 p.m. game with Banning.    ""Hopefully we'll get the other half of our offense going (next week) with  Winans,"" Vollnogle said.    Somewhat overlooked, except to the coaches, has been the excellent play of  Carson's defense.    Led by linebackers Edgar Ta'Ase and Nkosi Littleton, the Colts held Dorsey to  46 total yards and just two yards rushing. They have allowed only 106 yards  rushing this season, but are a long way from the school record.    The 1987 Carson defense gave up minus 90 yards rushing in 12 games. If you are  wondering how a team could hold opponents to minus yardage for an entire  season, remember that sacks count against rushing totals in prep football.    In 1987, outside linebacker Arnold Ale, who is redshirting at UCLA after  playing for Notre Dame's national championship team last year, set Carson  records for most sacks (22), most tackles for losses (43) and most yards  tackled for losses (222) in a season.    Banning, after building an 18-0 lead midway through the third quarter,  eventually lost to Crenshaw when Kevin Hicks returned a punt 79 yards for a  touchdown with 4:37 left to play at Gardena High.    Vollnogle said he will try to keep the ball away from Hicks when Carson meets  Crenshaw on Nov. 17.    ""That guy is super,"" the coach said. ""He's the best running back I've seen.  We're not going to kick the ball to him. He's like the Rocket (Raghib Ismail)  they have at Notre Dame.""    Vollnogle didn't think Banning's first loss (the Pilots are 6-1-1) would have  much of an effect on either team heading into Thursday's game.    ""I don't think it will bother them,"" he said. ""The Banning-Carson game is still  the Banning-Carson game. Banning is going to play their best game, and  hopefully we're going to play our best game.""    The message on the marquee outside Hawthorne High on Friday night read, ""This  is the big one!""    Unfortunately for Hawthorne, it turned out to be a big one for the Leuzinger  football team.    The Olympians assured themselves of a spot in the Southern Section Division II  playoffs with a 23-14 victory, handing Hawthorne its first loss of the year and  dropping the Cougars into a first-place tie in the Bay League with Palos  Verdes.    ""They kicked our butts, that's all there is to it,"" said Hawthorne Coach Goy  Casillas, whose team, ranked No. 1 in Division II, fell to 8-1 overall and 5-1  in league play.    Quarterback-defensive back Zac Odom was perhaps Leuzinger's most determined  player. After allowing Hawthorne wide receiver Jermaine Jones to slip past him  for a six-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, Odom tripped and fell on  the Hawthorne track. This led to some finger-pointing by Jones.    Odom responded by leading Leuzinger to 16 unanswered points in the second  quarter, including a two-yard touchdown run. Hawthorne pulled within 16-14 on a  39-yard run by tailback Chris Alexander in the third quarter, but Odom again  gave Leuzinger a cushion with a 54-yard touchdown pass to receiver Donald Byrd.    With one game remaining, Leuzinger (7-1-1, 4-1-1) pulled a half-game behind  co-leaders Hawthorne and Palos Verdes (8-1, 5-1) in the Bay League race. All  have clinched playoff berths.    Still fighting for a post-season bid are Rolling Hills (6-2-1, 3-2-1) and Santa  Monica (5-3, 3-3). With only four possible spots available, counting a  wild-card berth, the last playoff position will be determined in Thursday's  Palos Verdes-Rolling Hills and Leuzinger-Santa Monica games.    Most teams play on Thursday this week because Veterans Day will be honored on  Friday.    West Torrance clinched its first league title in three years Friday night with  a decisive 52-14 win over visiting North Torrance.    The Ocean League champions were led by running back Josh Moore, who scored  three touchdowns on runs of 34, 7 and 93 yards to help the Warriors improve to  8-1 overall and 6-0 in league play. North (2-7, 2-4) was eliminated from  playoff contention.    The lone bright spot for North was wide receiver Eric Hansen, who caught eight  passes to give him a South Bay single-season record of 80. He also moved into  the No. 10 spot on the all-time CIF-Southern Section list.    After West, four Ocean League teams are contending for the two remaining  guaranteed spots in Division VII playoffs. In games Thursday, second-place  South (4-2 in league) faces North, third-place Redondo (3-2-1) meets Mira Costa  (3-3), and Morningside (3-3) plays last-place Centennial.

The message on the marquee outside Hawthorne High on Friday night read, ""This  is the big one!""    Unfortunately for Hawthorne, it turned out to be a big one for the Leuzinger  football team.    The Olympians assured themselves of a spot in the Southern Section Division II  playoffs with a 23-14 victory, handing Hawthorne its first loss of the year and  dropping the Cougars into a first-place tie in the Bay League with Palos  Verdes.    ""They kicked our butts, that's all there is to it,"" said Hawthorne Coach Goy  Casillas, whose team, ranked No. 1 in Division II, fell to 8-1 overall and 5-1  in league play.    Quarterback-defensive back Zac Odom was perhaps Leuzinger's most determined  player. After allowing Hawthorne wide receiver Jermaine Jones to slip past him  for a six-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, Odom tripped and fell on  the Hawthorne track. This led to some finger-pointing by Jones.    Odom responded by leading Leuzinger to 16 unanswered points in the second  quarter, including a two-yard touchdown run. Hawthorne pulled within 16-14 on a  39-yard run by tailback Chris Alexander in the third quarter, but Odom again  gave Leuzinger a cushion with a 54-yard touchdown pass to receiver Donald Byrd.    With one game remaining, Leuzinger (7-1-1, 4-1-1) pulled a half-game behind  co-leaders Hawthorne and Palos Verdes (8-1, 5-1) in the Bay League race. All  have clinched playoff berths.    Still fighting for a post-season bid are Rolling Hills (6-2-1, 3-2-1) and Santa  Monica (5-3, 3-3). With only four possible spots available, counting a  wild-card berth, the last playoff position will be determined in Thursday's  Palos Verdes-Rolling Hills and Leuzinger-Santa Monica games.    Most teams play on Thursday this week because Veterans Day will be honored on  Friday.    West Torrance clinched its first league title in three years Friday night with  a decisive 52-14 win over visiting North Torrance.    The Ocean League champions were led by running back Josh Moore, who scored  three touchdowns on runs of 34, 7 and 93 yards to help the Warriors improve to  8-1 overall and 6-0 in league play. North (2-7, 2-4) was eliminated from  playoff contention.    The lone bright spot for North was wide receiver Eric Hansen, who caught eight  passes to give him a South Bay single-season record of 80. He also moved into  the No. 10 spot on the all-time CIF-Southern Section list.    After West, four Ocean League teams are contending for the two remaining  guaranteed spots in Division VII playoffs. In games Thursday, second-place  South (4-2 in league) faces North, third-place Redondo (3-2-1) meets Mira Costa  (3-3), and Morningside (3-3) plays last-place Centennial.

0,FT943-1369 ,"FT943-1369 _AN-EIYAEACFFT 940924   FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: GM rental sale breathes life into buy-out business - The background to Vestar's takeover of the US car hire group worth an estimated Dollars 1bn      By TONY JACKSON   The sale of General Motors' National Car Rental subsidiary to Vestar Equity Partners, announced on Thursday, shows that the US buy-out movement is not dead after all. The deal is rumoured to be worth about Dollars 1bn including debt - a figure described by an adviser yesterday as not far off. If so, it is only the third US billion-dollar buy-out of the 1990s (the others were the Payless retail chain and the insurance company American Re). This is a far cry from the glory days of the 1980s. It is also a long step for Vestar, a buy-out firm founded in 1988 by Mr Daniel O'Connell, former co-head of management buy-outs at First Boston. To date, Vestar has done 13 deals with a total purchase price of Dollars 1.6bn. The National Car Rental deal takes it into rather a different league. However, Vestar has a useful asset in the form of Mr John Howard, its joint chief executive. Until he joined the firm in 1990, Mr Howard was with Wesray, another buy-out firm founded by Mr William Simon, ex-treasury secretary. One of Wesray's more spectacular coups, in which Mr Howard was closely involved, was the 1986 buy-out of Avis, National Car Rental's larger rival. The sums involved in the Avis deal are worth recalling. Wesray bought Avis in July 1986 for Dollars 265m plus Dollars 1.34bn of assumed debt. It then raised Dollars 570m through disposals. In September 1987, it sold Avis to its employees for Dollars 1.75bn. In just over a year, Wesray had more than tripled its money. Whether the same can be done with National Car Rental is another matter. Its recent history is decidedly chequered. General Motors first took a stake in 1988. In 1992, it took control, and in the same year took a Dollars 744m charge against profits for losses and restructuring at its new subsidiary. For a while, GM thought seriously about winding the business up. However, at the start of 1993, it brought in Jay Alix, a firm of specialist consultants, to sort it out. A year later GM announced that the business had been profitable at the operating level through 1993, and that it was thinking of selling it. At about the same time, Ford was moving to take 100 per cent ownership of its own car rental business, Hertz. The difference in strategy between close rivals is striking. Ford points out that besides providing a large sales outlet for its cars, the rental business allows it to evaluate their performance. 'We've been pretty happy with Hertz,' Ford commented yesterday. 'After all, it is the car business.' The GM line is somewhat different. Rental, it says, is just not profitable enough. It can involve selling cars on unattractive terms, and often means taking them back second hand. 'In the last couple of years,' GM said yesterday, 'we've been pulling back the number of cars we've sold to rental agencies. We're trying to redirect into selling direct to customers, which is better for GM than the subsidised market of rental fleets.' Meanwhile, GM will maintain its existing supply agreement with National Car Rental. Thereafter it is up to Mr Howard to find value where GM failed. In the chiller climate of the 1990s, perhaps Vestar is taking a risk after all.   Companies:-  General Motors Corp.     National Car Rental System Inc.     Vestar Equity Partners.

0,FT911-3983 ,"FT911-3983 _AN-BDVB1AC2FT 910422   FT  22 APR 91 / Paying the price of traffic jams: A city's proposal to fit meters to all vehicles      By RICHARD TOMKINS   THE journey from Cambridge railway station to Cambridgeshire County Council's headquarters was short: but not so short as to prevent the taxi driver making his point. 'It's a complete load of old cobblers,' he explained. 'It's bad enough that you should have to sit in a traffic jam at all, without having to pay for the privilege.' Yet pay he might, along with every other driver in Cambridge: for the city is planning to be the first in Europe to charge people on a pay-as-you-go basis for the use of its roads. The idea of rationing road space by charging for it - known as road pricing  -is gaining ground as offering the most realistic solution to traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas. Until now, European governments have preferred to live with worsening traffic jams rather than risk the political repercussions of introducing such a scheme. But in Cambridge the county council has been thrust into the vanguard of transport planning by a mounting traffic crisis. The city's rapid economic growth has caused traffic on the main radial roads to increase by 47 per cent over the past 10 years, and it is forecast to rise by another 40 per cent by the end of the decade. The existing roads simply cannot cope, and increasing road capacity would mean demolishing swathes of the city centre. The Conservative-controlled county council has decided that the only alternative is to manage demand. The method it has chosen is to discourage people from using scarce road space at the busiest times by charging drivers who add to congestion. Vehicles would be fitted with meters which monitored their progress through the traffic. Any vehicle stopping four times or more within any  1/2 -km stretch, or taking more than three minutes to cover the same distance, would start clocking up units which would be charged to the driver. For example, the traffic planners estimate that a typical 5km journey would clock up between four and eight units. If the units were priced at 20p, the journey would cost between 80p and Pounds 1.60. Drivers would pay their charges with pre-paid smart cards, rather like phonecards, which would be inserted into the meter and debited as the journey progressed. A visual display would tell drivers how many debits remained. The meter would be linked to the fuel system and would theoretically cut off the fuel supply when credits ran out. In practice, an 'overdraft' would be allowed up to, say, 50 units to give people time to obtain a fresh supply of cards. Normally dormant, the meters would come into operation when activated by micro-wave signals emitted from roadside beacons at all 17 entry points to the city. Similar signals would switch the meters off as vehicles left. Meters would be fitted compulsorily, but free of charge, to all vehicles normally kept within 12 miles of the city centre. Some 92 per cent of all journeys into the centre originate within a 12-mile radius. Visitors from further afield would buy day passes from machines at city entry points. These would be priced at slightly above the average cost of a metered city centre journey. Day passes would be placed in windscreens and, as with the meters, would respond to the micro-wave signals from the roadside beacons. Vehicles failing to respond as they passed an entry point would be automatically photographed so that the drivers could be traced through their registration numbers and penalised. Ultimately, the aim would be to use the proceeds from the system to construct a light rapid-transit railway which would provide car drivers with an alternative means of entry to the city. The system is the brainchild of Mr Brian Oldridge, transport director at Cambridgeshire County Council. It is being developed by Newcastle University with a grant from the Science and Engineering Research Council. At present, the only other road pricing system is in Singapore, where motorists have to buy a daily or weekly permit if they want to drive into the city centre during the morning peak. Permits are checked by police at the city's 29 entry points. Mr Oldridge says the fault with the Singapore system is that it represents a tax on entry to the city which does not relate directly to the use of the road space. Under the Cambridge system, people will pay only when they add directly to congestion. The cost, too, will depend on the motorists themselves. If large numbers of them insist on using busy roads at busy times, their journey costs will rise as delays worsen. If, conversely, they try to avoid adding to congestion, the traffic jams will ease and journey costs will come down. 'Our plan follows simple free-market principles,' he says. 'Motorists themselves will define the tolerance level. If the congestion price is too high, it will meet resistance from the market and the price will come down.' Mr Oldridge is hoping to get a trial of the system in operation by 1994 with a view to introducing a full-scale system in 1996. Before then, the county council will have to seek appropriate powers through a private bill. Inevitably, this will cause controversy. Surprisingly there seems remarkably little opposition locally. Mr Oldridge says a city-centre pedestrianisation scheme has brought more objections. He has received only eight letters on the subject of road pricing, with more of them in favour than against. If the taxi driver represents the majority, it appears to be a silent one. Editorial comment, Page 22  The Financial Times   London Page 6 Graph (Omitted). Map (Omitted).  "

Most profiles require  that a velocity of 1.3-2.5 km/s be achieved, which means that  more than 150 m/s could be saved with a lunar flyby in terms of  characteristic velocity. The trajectory proposed would  approximate sectors of conical sections. If used for the mission  to the McAuliffe asteroid in the INEO project, the savings in  characteristic velocity would be 183 m/s. Figures 3, references  7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.     "
0,FT941-12578 ,"FT941-12578 _AN-EA3BCABJFT 940129   FT  29 JAN 94 / Car industry fears diesel crisis: Sales surge could be jeopardised by government report on pollution      By JOHN GRIFFITHS   The scale of the surge in diesel-vehicle sales in the UK new-car market has caught the motor industry by surprise. Sales rose from fewer than 10,000 a year at the start of the 1980s to about 120,000 in 1988 - 6 per cent of the market. Last year the total was 340,472, a fifth of the market. The rise has continued this month. An angry industry was last night wondering whether the boom will be slowed or even halted by publication of the Department of the Environment's Quality of Urban Air Review Group study. The report warned that a bigger diesel-car population could lead to a worsening of emissions of nitrogen oxides (Nox) and particles containing carcinogens - claims rejected by the industry. A similar report in Germany in the late 1980s brought diesel car growth to a halt, although it is now recovering. While the industry claims that it has no reason to favour either form of vehicle, it fears confusion among motorists about the merits or hazards of diesel cars may lead to deferred purchasing decisions, slowing the new-car market's recovery from recession. Diesels have been the single-biggest growth sector as motorists have been attracted by the 25 per cent to 30 per cent better fuel economy compared with petrol equivalents. This is particularly so now that purchase-price premiums demanded for diesels are reducing sharply. Growth has also been encouraged by a widespread view that diesels are more environmentally friendly than petrol engines, partly because they produce substantially less carbon dioxide than petrol cars, thus helping to combat global warming. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Retail Motor Industry Federation and leading component makers all argue that the report - which they complain was compiled without consulting industry sources - ignored several factors. These include developments in engine technology, specific advantages of diesel engines during short, urban journeys, and the greater consistency of diesel emissions over the life of a vehicle compared with the breakdown in efficiency of petrol engines. According to Mr John Mardell, chief engineer at Lucas Diesel Systems, although Nox emissions initially are higher than with a petrol car, the emissions even from a catalyst-equipped petrol car worsen steadily over the vehicle's life so that the total balances out. On short journeys, pollutant emissions from a petrol car can be 16 times higher than with a diesel, Mr Mardell says. Mr Ernie Thompson, SMMT chief executive, says that 85 per cent of vehicle pollution is attributable to elderly or poorly maintained vehicles. Diesel Vehicle Emissions and Urban Air Quality.

Eight years ago, Sohrab Rostamian and Bijan Khalili, who fled their homeland  amid Iran's revolutionary chaos in the late 1970s, published a 96-page  telephone directory of businesses owned by the growing number of Iranian  refugees in Southern California.    This year, the Iranian Yellow Pages is 848 pages long, listing about 1,600  businesses and professionals. The number of Iranian dentists, for example, that  are listed in the book has climbed from six to 91. Rostamian and Khalili have  set up a 411-like information service to give callers telephone numbers of  Iranian businesses in their native Farsi language.    The reason for the growth of Ketab Corp., the Van Nuys parent company the two  men own and run, is that Southern California, particularly the West San  Fernando Valley, has become home to the largest concentration of Iranians in  the United States. Most fled Iran in the wake of the 1979 revolution led by the  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died Saturday. As many as 300,000 Iranians are  believed to be living in Southern California, including some 30,000 Iranian  Jews such as Rostamian and Khalili.    A large number of the Iranians in the United States came from the nation's  elite group of professionals such as doctors, lawyers and engineers. Some have  established large, well-known businesses. The Bijan boutiques in Beverly Hills  and New York were founded by Iranian-born designer Bijan Pakzad. Adrays, a  chain of discount electronics stores, was started by Iranian Masud Hakim and  two partners. Iran-born developer Kambiz Hemkat is building the 22-story Center  West tower in Westwood.    Most of Rostamian's and Khalili's advertisers in the 1989 Iranian Yellow Pages  paid $650 a year for a full-page ad. Businesses also are listed in a computer  database of numbers given to people who call the information line. Some 34,000  copies of the yellow pages are distributed free and are used by nearly 200,000  Iranians, the partners estimated.    Most information in the Iranian Yellow Pages is written in Farsi, with a small  amount of English scattered throughout. Pages are numbered from right to left  because that is how Iranian books are numbered.    A standard yellow pages logo, showing two fingers walking across the pages of a  book, adorns the front of the book as well as Ketab's headquarters building on  Van Nuys Boulevard. The main difference is that the fingers are walking on  pages of green, white and red, the colors of the Iranian flag.    Most of the advertisers are professionals or small-to-medium-sized businesses.  Beverly Hills urologist James Elist, who moved to the United States from Iran  in 1976, said that two to three patients a week locate him through the Iranian  Yellow Pages. Some large firms, such as brokerage houses and insurance  companies, advertise in the directory, typically featuring Iranian employees in  their ads.    Ketab Corp. is grossing about $1 million a year, compared to about $80,000 in  1981. Ketab (which means ""book"" in Farsi) has a direct-mail service to  Iranians. Two years ago, the information line was started (818-908-0808,  because ""08"" was once the information number in Iran, equivalent to the U.S.  use of 411.)    Ketab also operates a bookstore in Westwood for Iranians. (The bookstore does  not sell Salman Rushdie's ""The Satanic Verses,"" the novel that inspired    Khomeini to call for the death of Rushdie. Rostamian and Khalili say they don't  want trouble.)    Rostamian, 38, an agricultural engineer by training, and Khalili, 38, a civil  engineer, are both natives of Tehran and became friends while studying during  the late 1960s at Pahlavi University, now the University of Shiraz, about 500  miles south of Tehran.    Fearing that trouble was coming, Rostamian left Iran for Europe in 1978 just  before the revolution, arriving in Los Angeles in 1979. Khalili left Iran in  1980, traveling first to Switzerland and then to Los Angeles, where he arrived  on Thanksgiving Day.    Growth in the number of Iranians in Southern California is one obvious reason  for growth in Rostamian's and Khalili's business.    But Rostamian has another interesting theory. He said many Iranian exiles  thought Khomeini's regime would only last a year or two and, sensing they would  be returning home soon, did not establish roots.    ""Many people didn't even unpack the first year,"" Rostamian said.    When it became clear that they were wrong, he said, people began settling down  and starting businesses and establishing practices that have started to thrive  the past few years.    Smaller Iranian Yellow Pages are published in Northern California, New York,  Houston and Atlanta. The Southern California version includes listings from  those areas.    Directories such as the Iranian Yellow Pages are part of a growing trend in  yellow pages -- a generic name used widely -- that are being published for  target ethnic groups. There are about 80 second-language, or non-English,  yellow pages across the country. Yellow pages featuring Vietnamese-owned  businesses have been published in Northern and Southern California. Direct  Language Publishing in San Francisco, the largest second-language yellow pages  company, publishes five Asian-language yellow pages in Northern California and  15 Spanish yellow pages throughout California and Arizona.    One reason the publications are often successful is that immigrants often want  to do business with other people from their home countries.    ""When you have big pockets of ethnic groups it makes sense. There have been  quite a few attempts to demographically segment the market,"" said Larry Small,  vice president of marketing for the Yellow Pages Publishers Assn. in Troy,  Mich.

"," LA060689-0120   66771    June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition      Business; Part 4; Page 9A; Column 2      955 words      FIND IT IN FARSI;    HELPED BY INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS, IRANIAN YELLOW PAGES GROW THICK      By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer      It's taking fingers longer every year to walk through the Iranian Yellow Pages.    Eight years ago, Sohrab Rostamian and Bijan Khalili, who fled their homeland  amid Iran's revolutionary chaos in the late 1970s, published a 96-page  telephone directory of businesses owned by the growing number of Iranian  refugees in Southern California.    This year, the Iranian Yellow Pages is 848 pages long, listing about 1,600  businesses and professionals. The number of Iranian dentists, for example, that  are listed in the book has climbed from six to 91. Rostamian and Khalili have  set up a 411-like information service to give callers telephone numbers of  Iranian businesses in their native Farsi language.    The reason for the growth of Ketab Corp., the Van Nuys parent company the two  men own and run, is that Southern California, particularly the West San  Fernando Valley, has become home to the largest concentration of Iranians in  the United States. Most fled Iran in the wake of the 1979 revolution led by the  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died Saturday. As many as 300,000 Iranians are  believed to be living in Southern California, including some 30,000 Iranian  Jews such as Rostamian and Khalili.    A large number of the Iranians in the United States came from the nation's  elite group of professionals such as doctors, lawyers and engineers. Some have  established large, well-known businesses. The Bijan boutiques in Beverly Hills  and New York were founded by Iranian-born designer Bijan Pakzad. Adrays, a  chain of discount electronics stores, was started by Iranian Masud Hakim and  two partners. Iran-born developer Kambiz Hemkat is building the 22-story Center  West tower in Westwood.    Most of Rostamian's and Khalili's advertisers in the 1989 Iranian Yellow Pages  paid $650 a year for a full-page ad. Businesses also are listed in a computer  database of numbers given to people who call the information line. Some 34,000  copies of the yellow pages are distributed free and are used by nearly 200,000  Iranians, the partners estimated.    Most information in the Iranian Yellow Pages is written in Farsi, with a small  amount of English scattered throughout. Pages are numbered from right to left  because that is how Iranian books are numbered.    A standard yellow pages logo, showing two fingers walking across the pages of a  book, adorns the front of the book as well as Ketab's headquarters building on  Van Nuys Boulevard. The main difference is that the fingers are walking on  pages of green, white and red, the colors of the Iranian flag.    Most of the advertisers are professionals or small-to-medium-sized businesses.  Beverly Hills urologist James Elist, who moved to the United States from Iran  in 1976, said that two to three patients a week locate him through the Iranian  Yellow Pages.
