In the last few months the Voice and Vision  organization has done things that are clear and prominent  examples of what can be called despotism and law breaking.    Apparently the management of the Voice and Vision  organization does not realize that one of the genuine and  emphatic demands of the people of Iran in the years before and  after the triumph of the sacred Islamic revolution was and is  preservation of the sanctity and greatness of human beings. One  of the great benefits that the revolution brought for the  patient and heroic people of Iran is the Islamic Majles, which  has taken shape with their votes, their views and their demands.  A responsible Majles is based on the nation's Constitution and  guarding the nation's rights, and no official has the right to  violate the lawfulness prevailing over the words and deeds of  the deputies and the Majles.    In reality, the experts who wrote and approved the  Constitution wrote articles and paragraphs about the rights of  the nation's deputies, which would bring national maturity, and  under which the ones chosen by society would be able to exercise  careful and comprehensive supervision over all society's affairs  in the light of a mass movement. With the cooperation and  assistance of the judiciary, they would be able to prevent any  kind of abuse of social or government position and  responsibility, and to lead the nation's law-making process  towards vindicating the rights of the people.    The recent acts by the Voice and Vision organization are a  serious warning, and ignoring this warning will lead to more  frightening and fearsome consequences. In reality, what has  happened during this period is a warning about the danger of  destroying the human sanctity and greatness and the nation's  social rights. Some people, in doing these things, have shown  their astonishing talent for continuing their obstinate and  dictatorial activities.    The truth is that what is more worrying and frightening than  anything else is the social developments, and especially the  effects of the acts on the social spirit, maturity, and thought.  Truly, if the people see that the nation's most extensive media  deals in this way with their deputies, and if the judicial  authorities do not deal with their lawbreaking seriously and  quickly, won't the people be right in thinking that their  freedom and social security are in danger of being assaulted by  lawbreakers?    Aren't the newspaper writers concerned, and aren't they  asking themselves, if the attitude and behavior of the  supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization spreads to the  nation's other sectors, what will happen to the right to think  and the sacred freedom that the revolution, the Imam and the  martyrs have given them?    2. After the heroic nation of Iran shook off years of  domination by despotic and selfish shahs, its back wounded by  the lashes of the shah's oppressive henchmen, it found a new  awakening under the influence of the religious and peaceful  thought and ideas of Seyyed Jamal al-Din Asadabadi. After this,  led by great people such as Sheykh Shahid 'Alameh Fazlollah  Nuri, it established the ""house of justice"" movement, but  unfortunately that seed did not bear fruit. It was beset by such  a plague that in a short time it was barren and dry.    The Islamic revolution gave the people a house of justice,  and the blood of great ones such as Sheykh Fazlollah and  Sattarkhan bore fruit after several decades and brought forth a  Majles that forms every four years with a vote of the people.    Therefore, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision  organization must realize that this nation has never lost its  historical memory, and it will never allow its own house (the  Majles) to be attacked through acts that are not worthy of a  manager in the Islamic government. Our path has been rocky from  the house of justice to the Majles, and we will never go back.    3. There is now no doubt that the acts of the supervisor of  the Voice and Vision organization were noting more than an  effort to deter the nation's deputies from the performance of  their duties as deputies and especially to deter them from  keeping the vow they have taken. Apart from the fact that the  brave deputies of the people are the heirs of the freedom,  bravery and steadfastness of the great martyr Modarres and Imam  Khomeyni (peace be upon him), public controversy and assaults on  honor such as these cannot deter them from their critical  mission as deputies.

He has also unleashed armed  gangs of settlers to terrorize and kill our people and profane  their holy sites. Unprovoked and ongoing killings carried out  by the occupation troops and settlers have targeted women,  children, and the elderly.    Despite Rabin's peace protestations, the launch of the  Madrid-Washington process, and the signing of the Oslo accord,  the Rabin government's crimes against our people have doubled as  have the draconian security measures, including collective  punishment, and the closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    In response to these criminal policies, our people have  stepped up their resistance to occupation and their  confrontations with its tools represented in the troops and  settlers, which is the same strategy of Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement].    The Rabin government's repressive measures have gone too far  and climaxed when his soldiers colluded with the settlers in the  hideous Hebron massacre against kneeling worshippers at dawn  prayers.    Moreover, soldiers opened fire on pregnant women while at  home or standing in their doorways, thus spurring our people to  escalate their resistance to occupation and to avenge the  martyrs of the horrific Hebron massacre.    To honor the martyrs' blood, the martyr 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam  Battalions active across our country decided to take revenge for  our martyrs' blood. Two of our heroic mujahidin carried out two  acts of martyrdom in 'Afula and Hadera against soldier and  settler targets. The operations were mounted in the face of the  strict security measures instituted by the Rabin government to  attend celebrations marking the anniversary of the theft of our  country.    The failure of the Rabin government's measures to preempt  our  heroic mujahidin on the eve of launching an implementation of  the Oslo accord and against the backdrop of his promises of  security and tranquility for the Zionist public as a result of  that accord and the disgraceful PLO concessions, coupled with  rising Likud opposition to his policies, has left him frustrated  and feeling a sense of doom and confusion.    Hamas would like to make the following points:    First: The terrorist Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has issued  a threat to brother Jordan, claiming that the Movement maintains  its headquarters on its territories. Rabin demanded that Jordan  crack down on Hamas in a wretched attempt to capitalize on a  confirmation by the Movement's representative in Amman that  al-Qassam Battalions were responsible for the heroic operations  in 'Afula and Hadera.    Rabin and his criminal government colleagues know only too  well that the planning, execution, and announcements on the  battalion's operations all originate in the occupied territories.    Using a combination of his inability to forestall these  operations and the exposure of his deceptiveness in the  settlement process, Rabin issued the threat to Jordan to advance  the following goals:    1. To shift attention away from the failure of his draconian  security and repressive measures to thwart the heroic acts of  martyrdom executed by al-Qassam Battalions and our people's  resistance throughout the land.    2. To use the clout of the United States to press Jordan  into signing a unilateral peace agreement with his government on  the Oslo accord model. This threat fits in with the inspection  of merchant vessels bound for the Port of al-'Aqabah as a lever  of pressure on brotherly Jordan and the retention of Syria on  Washinton's list of nations sponsoring terrorism as a tool to  press the Syrians into backing down on their demand for a  universal settlement on all fronts.    Hamas is not unaware of what the enemy hopes to reap from  peace -- the Arab parties' capitulation to its demeaning terms  and a consolidation of its dominance over our region, while it  stays in our territories. Rabin and his government's  allegations are false and groundless. Our Movement's  single-minded purpose is resistance to occupation until victory  and liberation.    Hamas hereby underlines its concern for the security and  stability of all the countries where it has political and media  representatives who observe their respective laws. Hamas  strives to deny any grounds for the occupying enemy to apply  pressure on any of these countries.    Second: Hamas' established policy had been that 'Izz al-Din  al-Qassam Battalion's operations should be directed exclusively  at occupation troops and its military agencies, as well as the  settlers as army reservists. Al-Qassam Battalions had taken  pains to spare civilians in their anti-occupation action.    However, the Rabin government's strong-arm tactics running  counter to the most basic human rights and the failure of the  enemy military and settlers to distinguish between fighter  mujahidin and unarmed civilians prompted al-Qassam Battalions to  adopt the principle of reciprocity, which has been sanctioned by  temporal and divine laws alike.    The 'Afula and Hadera attacks that targeted concentrations  of  troops and settlers and hit some civilians were meant as a  deterrent for the savage Zionist aggression on our people and a  legitimate revenge for the blood of the martyrs of the hideous  Hebron massacre. The actions were not a constant policy for  al-Qassam Battalions, but an exception dictated by the enemy  government.    Hamas is prepared to reconsider this exception, provided the  enemy prime minister, his government, and army undertake to stop  killing unarmed civilians of our people. Our objective is to  guarantee the security and safety of our people and deter  killers so that our people are not made easy targets for enemy  soldiers and unrestrained settler gangs. Hamas will adhere to  its policy of resistance as long as occupation remains.    Third: The quickened pace of jihad and heroic operations by  our mujahidin in al-Qassam Battalions fits in with the  Movement's game plan of resistance until occupation is routed  and our sacred land liberated.    To cover the abysmal failure of the Rabin government to  thwart our mujahidin's heroic operations, this government claims  that the Hamas' actions are designed to undermine or abort the  peace process, in an attempt to discredit Hamas in the eyes of  the internationaal community.    We want to make an oft-repated statement that Hamas is not  adverse to the principle of peace. However, the kind of peace  offered by the enemy government is not peace; it is a  consolidation of occupation and the iniquity to which our people  are subjected. We are aware that the Oslo operation is one of  humiliating surrender by the PLO leadership and capitulation to  the Zionist and American terms and dictates. The operation  carries the seeds of its own destruction; built on unjust and  false foundations, it is destined to crash.    The right beginning lies in the following steps:    1. A full Zionist withdrawal from our Palestinian land and  the dismantlement and removal of the settlements.    2. Free and fair general elections in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip in which our peole would choose their representatives and  leadership.    3. It is the elected leadership that reflects the hopes and  ambitions of our people and decides on the next steps and the  future of the Palestinian cause.    This is to shed light on Hamas' stands and to expose the  lies  and frivolities of the enemy prime minister. In the meantime,  Hamas promises our people to sustain the jihad and martyrdom  until the liberation of all of Palestine.     "

The delegation  saw the remains of the savage destruction wrought by the Israeli  occupation forces before the heroic town was liberated.    The al-Qunaytirah governor briefed the delegation on the  sacrifices made by the people of the governorate and the Syrian  Arab people to defend the homeland, the Palestinian cause, and  the Arab nation's causes. The governor said: Syria is working  to realize the just and comprehensive peace expounded by  President Hafiz al-Asad -- the peace of the brave. This will  restore occupied Arab territories and return rights to their  owners, based on UN resolutions. The governor also presented  Mr. Darawshah with the shield of liberated al-Qunaytirah.    Replying to the governor's speech, Darawshah said: We are  pleased to arrive in this governorate, which is a dear part of  Syria and the Arab nation. We look forward to the bright future  when this part will be merged with the other side of the  occupied Golan, which will have to be liberated and returned to  Syria and the Arab nation.    Darawshah conveyed the love of our people in occupied  Palestine and the Golan to the sons of the Syrian Arab people  and the wise leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad.    Darawshah said: We bow our heads and pay homage to the  Syrian people's sacrifices and martyrs for the sake of Palestine  and the Arab nation.    Concluding his speech, Darawshah said: Victory will  inevitably be realized. Occupied Golan will return to Syria.  This is the peace we understand, a peace that restores rights  their owners and ends Israel's occupation of all occupied Arab  territories. This is the cherished peace as described by  President Hafiz al-Asad, the peace of the brave.    In a statement to the SANA correspondent, Darawshah said:  The destruction we have seen demonstrates the savagery of the  occupation. This is a deplorable crime by the occupation  against al-Qunaytirah. Other acts of aggression and savage  practices have been carried out in other parts of Arab  countries, especially inside Palestine. Hundreds of villages  were destroyed. Thus, the Israeli occupation has added other  crimes to its series of criminal actions.    Darawshah called for Israel's withdrawal from occupied Golan  and for its return to its Syrian owners so Syrians, under the  leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, can rebuild  al-Qunaytirah, return its inhabitants, who were driven out, and  so it will return to its Syrian mother.    Darawshah and his delegation visited the martyrs cemetery,  placed a wreath on the martyr's monument, and read prayers for  the martyrs' chaste souls. He wrote an article in the visitors'  book in which he praised the heroic struggle of the Syrian Armed  Forces supported by the heroic Syrian people in defense of Arab  territory. Darawshah said: We are certain the darkness of the  occupation will end and the Israeli occupation will leave  occupied Syrian Golan and all occupied Arab territories.     "

This is  all part of the dirty war plan announced by the leader of that  gang, the war criminal, the murderer of women, children, and the  elderly; the supreme murderer of the armed forces, the terrorist  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in his ill-fated 27 April war speech. Our  armed forces continue their heroic resistance in the face of the  forces of treachery and betrayal which moved a huge force and  equipment toward the former border areas and especially towards  Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, and Karish.    Our armed forces managed yesterday and today not only to  stop  the advancing forces of the barbarous al-Ahmar gang in the  directions of Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, and Karish but to  force those forces to retreat and withdraw from their front line  positions after inflicting heavy losses. We do not pride  ourselves over victories or gloat over the losses of others by  talking about the losses since the first and last losers in this  war are the people and particularly the thousands pushed by the  leader of the al-Ahmar gang like a herd of goats to the  destructive slaughterhouse along the former dividing borders.  However, we must commend the rare heroic spirit and the high  morale of our armed and brave forces in al-Dali' and Karish. It  is sufficient to say that an old veteran yesterday succeeded in  destroying six hostile tanks in al-Dali' area.    If this shows anything, it shows the high spirit of morale  of  our armed forces who are inspired by the justice of the cause  they are defending as a sacred cause with regard to the Yemeni  people. This is the cause of dignity and the honor of women  which the adventurous al-Ahmar gang is attempting to trample on  with its tanks. [passage omitted]     "

The first question is: Why all the foot dragging and  compromising in putting into practice PLO-Israel agreements  calling for an Israeli withdrawal, deployment of Palestinian  police, and the transfer of power to Palestinian authorities?    The general consensus is that the responsibility [for the  'Afula operation] must be borne by the Israeli Government  because it is letting itself be swayed by extremists, settlers,  and army generals who thrive on war and bloodshed. The result  has been massacres perpetrated against the Palestinian people at  the Ibrahimi Mosque, in Hebron itself, in the Jabalyah camp in  Gaza, and throughout the Palestinian territory where the  Palestinians are being killed at random.    We have been telling the Israelis that violence breeds  violence and that blood [words indistinct] and that they should  honor agreements to which they put their signatures and observe  agreed upon dates. If the Israeli Government had met the 13  December date for implementation of the accord, much of the  chaste blood spilled in Hebron, Gaza, Khan Yunus, Janin,  Tulkarm, and Ramallah would have been spared. However, in  appeasing terror and terrorists in the settler and military  communities, the Israeli Government is turning a deaf ear to the  voice of truth, and the result is a vicious cycle of violence,  suffering, and blood.    Will the 'Afula operation bring the Israeli leadership to  its  senses? Will the Israeli leaders understand that killing  Palestinians cannot but have a price? Will they learn the  lesson that the protection of human life depends on the  establishment of peace rather than [words indistinct] and  procrastination.    It is hoped that acts of violence will give pause to all the  parties and prompt increased determination to reach the kind of  peace that obtains security for all concerned, saves lives on  all sides, and assures Palestinian rights, without which peace  will remain elusive.

Here is the text of the statement:    The secretariat of the General People's Congress reiterates  its anger at and condemnation of the horrible crime perpetrated  in the Ibrahimi mosque and the repeated acts of aggression  against the heroic Palestinian people which followed.    This horrible crime and other crimes perpetrated by the  occupying Israeli invaders are considered the vilest acts of  terrorism against innocent people performing the morning prayer  in the middle of the blessed month of Ramadan.    The secretariat of the General People's Congress stresses  that this crime and the others that have followed it are  officially organized terrorism officially directed by the  Israeli Government, which has based its existence on such a  program since its establishment under the protection of the  West, which has officially supported the policy of terrorism  manifested in crimes, massacres, and the building of arsenals  for weapons of mass destruction.    The secretariat of the General People's Congress, in  addressing the conscience of humanity and all honorable people  of the world headed by the sons of the Arab and Islamic nation,  is insistent that that an end must be put to the tyranny,  oppression, and repression exercised by the Israelis for racial  motives and with the support of the West. The secretariat urges  all of them, Arab and Islamic countries to exercise their rights  in the UN Security Council, the United Nations, and the  international forums to punish the tyrants who have been blinded  by force and fanaticism, to put an end to their terrorist  behavior and boycott them.    The secretariat of the General People's Congress asks that  everyone should shoulder their responsibilities vis-a-vis these  repeated horrible crimes which give warning of the results,  which will have reprehensible consequences.

They asked that their voices be heard  by world public opinion when they sought a halt to the course  pursued by the rulers of Iran, their violation of good  neighborly relations, and their infringement on the freedom of  others. They called upon the Iranians to cease these practices,  which are blatant aggression against defenseless citizens.    They also demanded the exposure of the fraud and false  claims  of the hostile media, which are aimed at fracturing the unity of  the Iraqis and creating dissension among them. They reaffirmed  that their living conditions are normal, stable, and safe.     "

The brother president visited al-Quds Camp in Dhamar and  Dhafar Camp in [word indistinct]. He was received by the  brother commanders of the two camps, officers, non-commissioned  officers [NCO's], and the ranks. They expressed their gladness  over the brother president's visit to familiarize himself with  their conditions. They stated their high state of preparedness  to fulfill their patriotic duty and to make sacrifices in the  cause of defending the homeland and its unity and its gains and  democratic, developmental, and other achievements and  confronting the gang of rebellion and secession that has sought  to destroy and tear up the homeland. They emphasized that  Yemeni unity lives in the heart and conscience of every worthy  citizen. The Yemeni unity, they emphasized, is the culmination  of the fight of strugglers and the sacrifices of our people's  martyrs and their Armed Forces. They stressed that all  sacrifices are nothing when made for the sake of the homeland.  They noted the depth of their loyalty to God, the homeland, the  revolution, and unity, and their support for our patriotic  leadership under brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who has shown  himself to be a unionist leader dedicated to the nationalist  principles and the causes of the homeland and its unity.    The brother chairman of the presidential council, commander  in chief of the Armed Forces, spoke to the brother officers and  NCO's and ranks of the Armed and Security Forces. He paid  tribute to their high morale and the heroic performance of the  Armed and Security Forces who have proved loyal to principles  and who have kept their promise to God. They were truly the  soldiers of right, revolution, and unity, who have rallied to  the will of their people at all times and written bright pages  of acts of heroism in defense of our people's right to a free  and decent life. He indicated the challenges the homeland is  having to tackle following the actions taken by the gang of  rebellion and secession. President Salih reviewed this gang's  diabolical scheme through which it has sought to tear apart the  homeland's unity, which was forged on 22 May 1990 as a fruit of  a long struggle and (?unique) sacrifices.

The brother president noted  the devastation this has caused to the homeland.    All conspiracies targeting unity and democracy have crashed  and will crash on the rock of the steadfastness and awareness  and strong will of our people and their Armed Forces, the  president said. He noted the gang of rebellion and secession's  cease-fire violations committed within the context of their  defiance of the will of the international community. This  separatist, rebellious gang in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party,  lacking all values and betraying all principles and covenants,  has had no qualms about perpetrating the ugliest crimes against  the homeland and the people. The gang is continually violating  the cease-fire and flouting the UN Security Council resolution.  We would like to reiterate here, added the brother president,  that if this murderous gang will not be bound by the cease-fire  resolution and continues to breach it -- it is the fourth  opportunity this gang has been given to abide by the resolution  -- the forces of unity and legitimacy are going to force it into  respecting and abiding by it.    The brother commander in chief of the Armed Forces  reiterated  our country's commitment to all the clauses of the Security  Council resolution. He stressed that our valiant Armed Forces  continue to be fully observant of the cease-fire resolution  despite the recurring acts of aggression on their positions by  elements of this rebellious gang, which is in its last gasps of  breath [word indistinct] destruction of all vital economic  installations before its departure, including the Aden refinery  and the electricity plant at [word indistinct] and other  facilities as an act of revenge on the homeland and an  expression of hatred for the Yemeni people and their  achievements.

They have proved  valiant heroes fearless of death in that they are fighting the  cause of right against wrong. They are also fighting for the  great principles and achievements that our people have fought  for -- unity and democracy, above all.

Our sources  in the south reported that a resistance group launched a  lightening attack against al-'Amarah governor's headquarters in  al-Mashtal using medium-caliber machine guns and RPG-7's,  causing damage to the building.    The sources said that a large number of the regime's  henchmen  and officials of his organs of repression were present in the  building at the time of the attack. Ambulances and  fire-fighting teams were seen hurrying to the destroyed  headquarters and spent many hours pulling out the dead bodies of  the regime's henchmen.    Our sources later learned that the al-'Amarah governor was  away in Baghdad at the time of the assault.    The regime placed its forces on alert, adopted emergency  measures in al-'Amarah, and conducted an extensive search  operation that included arrests of citizens.    Another group of the Islamic resistance forces attacked a  military command vehicle belonging to the tyrant Saddam's forces  in Mid-January while it was traveling in al-Kahla' district in  al-'Amarah Maysan Governorate. Our sources said that the  vehicle was completely destroyed and the occupants killed  included a major, a lieutenant, and the driver. Following the  attack, the tyrant Saddam's forces conducted extensive patrols  and set up checkpoints manned by security personnel to search,  arrest, and interrogate citizens.    Kurdish opposition sources reported that an explosion has  occurred in the Border Guard headquarters which is adjacent to  the General Security Directorate in Baghdad. They said the  evacuation of those killed or wounded by the blast lasted for  two hours.    The same sources said that another military building used by  the Special Forces in Baghdad Governorate was the target of a  machine-gun attack in mid-January, killing army captain Sabri  Yasin al-Rawi and three other mercenaries.    According to our sources, the headquarters of al-Hindiyah's  district officer, a man known for his criminal behavior, was the  target of a lightning attack by five mujahidin.    Our mujahidin in Karbala' Governorate earlier attacked the  car of Kazim Marhun, a tribal chief in the area, forced him to  get out of the car, and then shot him. They then left behind  leaflets warning all those who terrorize our people to stop such  actions or they would meet the same fate.    Our heroic mujahidin inflicted just retribution on the  criminal Sattar 'Adday Taha in al-Jurn in al-Kaba'ish District  because he had perpetrated treasonous acts against our people in  that area. He had received several warnings to stop  implementing the tyrant Saddam's orders and to learn from the  death of his brother Samir 'Adday, who used to spy on our people  and who later received his just retribution at the hands of our  mujahidin.

Today, these iniquitous, savage acts are being  perpetrated against the areas of al-Dali Province and the  districts of Karish and Mukayris, which are the areas that were  on the borders before Yemeni unity. In the al-Dali area, forces  of the adventurist gang of the al-Ahmar clan continued to shell  al-Dali town and its neighboring villages with heavy artillery,  rockets, and aircraft in the tenth attempt to penetrate the  defenses of our valiant forces which are confronting these  iniquitous forces with total bravery and audacity.    The defenders of this province, in cooperation with the  masses of the people which began to arrive in this province  (?from) various provinces of Lahij Governorate, are displaying a  valiant resistance and splendid heroism, which reflects the  spirit of the original struggle between our forces and the  masses. Despite the intensive random shelling against the  peaceful villages and houses by the forces of the al-Ahmar gang,  our defending forces continued their resolute confrontation,  inflicting on the hostile forces heavy loss of life and  equipment.    In another former border area, the adventurist Sanaa clique  tried to capture (Kathbub) District in the direction of Bab  al-Mandab [word indistinct], but our heroic forces repulsed this  abortive attempt and the attacking forces of the al-Ahmar clan  returned to where they came from, suffering losses.    As for the capital of Abyan Governorate, our forces have  almost imposed their control of this area after units of the  al-'Amaliqah forces retreated and scattered in all directions,  while many of these units, officers and other ranks, surrendered  and joined our forces.    The Defense Ministry appeals to Arab and world public  opinion, particularly the bodies and organizations concerned  with defending human rights, including the Yemeni Red Crescent,  the Arab Red Crescent organizations, and the International Red  Crescent, to condemn the murderous campaigns against captives  who fell into the hands of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan in the  northern governorates, as well as savage acts and random  shelling of villages and houses of citizens, particularly in  al-Dali Province and in Karish and Mukayris districts, and the  forceful detention of these citizens. It calls on these  organizations to intervene to rescue the wounded and provide  first aid to them, particularly among the civilians. While the  Defense Ministry conveys to our people and to the Arab and world  these facts, it expresses full confidence that all the abortive  attempts of the bloody gang of the al-Ahmar clan will fail.  Their deeds will crash on the rock of our armed forces'  steadfastness whose number increases daily by hundreds and  thousands, in addition to the masses of people who increasingly  support our forces, the forces of unity, democracy and  modernization.

The June 3 uprising of South Korean students and people in  1964 against the aggressive and treacherous ""talks"" between the  Japanese reactionaries and puppets was a just anti-imperialist,  anti-fascist democratic resistance to do away with the foreign  forces and traitors and restore the national dignity and  sovereignty.    Thirty years have passed since the uprising, but the desire  of the South Korean people to live in an independent society  free from foreign domination and interference has not yet been  realized.    South Korea still remains a U.S. colony and military base  and its people fall victim to it.    Because of the flunkeyist treacherous acts of the Kim  Yong-sam group the U.S. political, economic and military  domination over South Korea is intensifying and the people's  sovereignty is violated ruthlessly.    Having brought the North-South dialogue to a total freeze at  the instigation of the United States, the Kim Yong-sam group  committed without hesitation such never-to-be-condoned crimes  as unilaterally nullifying the ""joint declaration on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula"" which was adopted and  effectuated by the North and the South and announcing its  renouncement.

To be sure, Camp David would not have been possible without the efforts of the  heroic Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, and the gritty Israeli prime minister,  Menachem Begin -- efforts that were quite fittingly honored by the 1978 Nobel  Peace Prize.

There is now a tendency to deprecate the achievements of Camp David. These  criticisms seem to me wrongheaded. It is true that the Camp David accords did  not solve the Middle East problem in any distinctive way. It is true that the  Palestinian issue continues to plague the region. It is true that radicals like  Hafez Assad of Syria and Saddam Hussein of Iraq remain as unreconciled as ever  to peace. But why blame these on Camp David?    Instead of looking at the problems that remain, why not look at what was  accomplished? After Camp David a major Middle East war, on the models of 1967  and 1973, was far less likely. After Camp David an unprecedented pattern of  normal diplomatic relations was established between Israel and one of its Arab  neighbors. After Camp David Israel exchanged land, a lot of it strategic land,  for peace. After Camp David it was possible to think that unending conflict  between Israel and its neighbors was not a given, like the sun rising in the  east. These were not mean accomplishments. In fact, they were great  accomplishments. And they were Carter's accomplishments as much as any man's.    Amid all the current argument and commentary about the peace process in the  Middle East, there are two lessons of Camp David that ought to be borne in  mind:    First, the agreements reached there followed a negotiation that was itself made  possible by a changed political situation: Agreement requires negotiation, and  negotiation requires politicking. You just can't start cold with negotiations  and expect much of anything to happen except rhetorical cannonading. Sadat's  stunning mission to Jerusalem in 1977 and Carter's invitation to Sadat and  Begin to come to Camp David under the President's auspices were acts of great  political imagination that broke logjams, changed the political environment and  made negotiation possible. Defining similar acts of political imagination --  instead of arguing about spurious international peace conferences -- ought to  be the first order of business for the Bush Administration, the new Israeli  government of Yitzhak Shamir, the leadership of the Palestinian movement and  King Hussein of Jordan.    Second, American leadership was essential in dramatically altering the  political relationships among negotiators so that negotiation would be not only  possible but also successful. For reasons that seem to have involved a  fascinating amalgam of religious conviction, personal self-confidence, a trace  of recklessness about his own political hide and sheer American stubbornness,  Carter simply would not let the Camp David negotiation fail. An American  President constantly looking over his shoulder at a carping press corps and a  fiddling Congress could never have pulled off Camp David.

It is no secret that I had, and still have, the most serious differences with  Jimmy Carter about America's role in world politics.

They strongly denounced such acts by the Socialist Party war  criminals, which have caused the death of many women, children,  and elderly people. This came in a statement issued by the  Yemen Ulema Society.    The statement said that fighting against the secessionist,  rebellious elements in the Socialist Party leadership is  legitimate because it seeks to eradicate sedition, protect  religion against the advocates of apostasy and secession, and  avert the dangers posed to the people and the country. God  says: And fight them on until there is no more tumult or  oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God.  [Koranic verse]    The ulema praised the heroic stands of the Army and Security  Forces men, who are resolutely fighting the forces of evil and  sedition and the advocates of secession and division, scoring  great victories by depending on God and holding out in the  fighting arenas. The ulema appealed to all our Yemeni people to  support our Armed and Security Forces, confront the rumor  mongers, and report any attempt to disturb security. The ulema  supported the wise and sound steps taken by the Presidential  Council, the House of Representatives, and the Council of  Ministers to deal with the situation and destroy the dangers of  sedition and its perpetrators. They stressed their rejection of  any interference.    The ulema concluded their statement by urging our people to  sincerely beseech Almighty God in their prayers to aid our  valiant soldiers and grant them victory.    God says: Already has Our Word been passed before this to  Our Servants sent by Us, that they would certainly be assisted,  and that Our forces,-they surely must conquer. [Koranic verse]     "

Official sources said the two men were summoned by the  authorities and asked to ""decide whether they are  Palestinian--in which case they would be given a temporary  two-year passport given to residents of the occupied  territories, or they are Jordanian citizens who comply with  Jordanian laws.""    The sources said the two were also asked to refrain from  making any statements claiming responsibility for attacks in the  occupied territories.    A senior Jordanian official told the Jordan Times that the  government had intended to curb the activities of Hamas in  Jordan without much publicity but was pressured to publicise  these measures after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin issued  a warning to Jordan charging that it was helping Hamas.    ""We had already instructed the minister of interior to deal  with the issue before Rabin had his press conference,"" the  senior official said.    Hamas representatives were not available for comment Monday,  but the movement issued a statement charging that Mr. Rabin was  ""creating fictitious conflicts to cover up for his political  failure.""    ""The prime minister of the enemy Yitzhaq Rabin has issued a  warning to Jordanin which he claimed that there is a leadership  for Hamas on its territory and demanding that the Jordanian  government take action against its activities,"" the statement  responded.    ""It is a failed attempt to use the confirmation by the Hamas  representatives in Amman of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's Brigades'  claim of responsibility for the heroic acts in 'Afula and  Hadera,"" the statement said.    ""Rabin and his government know very well that the  al-Qassam's  Brigades conduct, plan and execute their activities from the  occupied territories,"" the statement said, adding that ""his  failure to put an end to these attacks, and the revealing of his  deception in the settlement process has caused him to use these  attacks to issue a warning to Jordan.""    Hamas said that Mr. Rabin needed to warn Jordan to achieve  the following objectives:    --Direct attention away from the failure of his security  measures and his oppressive measures in putting an end to the  heroic attacks by the al-Qassam Brigades.    --Use the ""American sword"" to pressure Jordan towards  signing  a unilateral agreement with his government similar to the one  signed in Oslo, and this warning falls in line with the policy  of the U.S. administration which uses the naval blockade on  al-'Aqabah as a way to pressure Jordan for the same purpose.    Despite the strong language against Israel and Mr. Rabin's  government, the Hamas statement appeared to set a precedent in  opening the door for bargaining with Israel.    Stressing that the attacks against Israeli civilians were in  retaliation against the Hebron massacre of Palestinian  worshippers, Hamas said that this was not a policy but the  ""exception.""    ""Hamas is ready to reconsider this exception on the  condition  that the enemy's prime minister, his government and his army  halt completely all killings of unarmed civilians from our  people,"" the statement said.    ""We are not against peace,"" the statement added,"" but the  peace offered by the government of the enemy is not peace but a  consolidation of occupation and the injustice falling on our  people.""    ""While we in Hamas know well that the Oslo agreement is  nothing but humiliating surrender from the PLO... we think that  the right beginning would be on the following foundations,"" the  statement added.    Hamas demanded the ""full Israeli withdrawal from our  Palestinian land and dismantling and removal of all settlements,  the holding of full and free elections in the West Bank and Gaza  to select the representatives of our people and their  leadership.""    ""The chosen leadership will be the one that represents the  aspirations and hopes of our people and will decide on the  ensuing steps,"" the statement concluded in what most analysts  termed as an indication that Hamas was proposing itself as an  alternative leadership to the Palestine Liberation Organisation,  through the results of the elections and by deduction the side  to conduct negotiations with Israel.

Our Army  is always a place for the gathering of many young people. Being  young soldiers determined to dedicate ourselves to national  defense in modern times, whom should we worship?    Historical experience and current needs in reality all tell  us: We should take the heroic figures who dedicated their whole  lives to national independence, people's liberation, and social  progress as our examples, and should let these heroic figures  firmly occupy the ""star position"" in our minds.    The heroic figures of our party and our Army are outstanding  representatives of the masses in their hundreds of millions  emerging in the prolonged practice of revolution and  construction. Some of them are national heroes who have made  immortal contributions to national liberation and independence,  and they include such proletarian revolutionaries of the older  generation as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and  Deng Xiaoping; some of them are revolutionary martyrs with iron  will power, such as Yang Jingyu, Fang Zhimin, Ye Ting, and Jiang  Zhujun, who were determined to shed their blood for the cause of  the party and sacrifice their lives to show their loyalty to the  party; some of them are combat heroes such as Dong Cunrui, Huang  Jiguang, Yang Zirong, and Yang Yucai, who fought bravely and  defeated the enemies with a fearless spirit; some of them are  communist fighters such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, and  Su Ning, who served the people wholeheartedly in the peaceful  environment and dedicated themselves to the service of their  country through diligent work; some of them are pioneers on the  front of scientific research such as Qian Xuesen, Deng Jiaxian,  and Qian Shaojun, who created miracles again and again in  scaling the heights of modern national defense science and  technology in their hard work over the past decades; some of  them are physically disabled people who have healthy minds and  make great contributions to the party's cause, such as Wu  Yunduo, Shi Guangzhu, and Li Zhijun; and others are innumerous  unknown heroes who never claim credit for their meritorious  services, such as ""living martyrs"" Li Yuan, Jiang Yuduo, and Cao  Faqing. The mentality, character, and will of these heroic  figures give expression to the supreme realm of thought that  communists should attain, and also represent the lofty virtues  of the revolutionary soldiers. We can say that every hero is a  banner. To study, live, work, and fight as the heroes did, we  shall be able to establish the proletarian world outlook as soon  as possible, realize the value of revolutionary life to the  maximum, stand all tests in the course of reform, opening, and  developing the socialist market economy, and always preserve our  revolutionary youth.    Emulating the heroes, creating heroic deeds, and taking the  path of a hero is always the glorious tradition of this Army.  In both wartime and peacetime, as soon as millions of young  people join this Army, they begin to really worship and emulate  the heroic figures, although some of them have just begun to  understand the theory of revolution; their mentality also begins  to rise to a lofty realm, and their behavior also becomes great.  The course of many heroes' growth in this Army shows that they  first worship heroes, then emulate heroes and also strive to  become heroes themselves. Young people are undergoing the  process of forming their world outlook, and their minds are  rather malleable. In light of this characteristic of young  people, we should guide young soldiers to admire heroic figures,  continuously adjust their life orientation, and take the  initiative in emulating the examples. This is a necessary  condition and the most effective way to cultivate more heroes.  For various reasons, the values cherished by young people are  now becoming more diverse. In such circumstances, we should  draw the attention of young officers and servicemen to  worshiping and emulating heroes, and should encourage them to  become heroes themselves. This will certainly play a  significant role in prompting them to become soldiers with a  lofty ideal of revolution, with lofty morals, good education,  and a strong sense of discipline as soon as possible.    Serving the people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of  this  Army. Our soldiers are required to be ready to shed their blood  and sacrifice their lives to fulfill their sacred mission, and  this characteristic of the armed forces also requires us to  worship heroes. In the years of war, no matter how busy the  troops were in combat, production, and mass work, they continued  to carry out the activity of emulating heroes and striving to  become heroes. This is always an important part of this Army's  political work. Under the new historical conditions, this Army  is striving to realize the general goal of revolutionalization,  modernization, and regularization, and to fulfill the sacred  mission of providing security guarantees for reform, opening,  and socialist modernization. We should still vigorously carry  forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, continue to carry  forward the ""five revolutionary spirits"" advocated by Comrade  Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character pioneering spirit advocated  by Chairman Jiang. This should become a strong mental pillar  for promoting this Army's comprehensive development. Therefore,  admiring and emulating heroic figures and creating heroic deeds  should become common conduct of contemporary revolutionary  soldiers.    This Army is the candle of innumerous heroes. In order to  bring about more heroic figures under the new situation, leaders  and political organs at all levels should fully use various  effective educational forms, such as reading books, giving  lectures, holding singing parties, arranging glory rooms, seeing  good films, and listening to old comrades's talk about the  tradition, to give wide publicity to the heroic figures in  various periods and on various fronts so that our cadres and  soldiers will always live in the atmosphere of revolutionary  heroism, and more brilliant stars will rise to make the life in  the barracks more vigorous.

Official sources said the two men were summoned by the  authorities and asked to ""decide whether they are Palestinian --  in which case they would be given a temporary two-year passport  given to residents of the occupied territories, or they are  Jordanian citizens who comply with Jordanian laws.""    The sources said the two were also asked to refrain from  making any statements claiming responsibility for attacks in the  occupied territories.    A senior Jordanian official told the Jordan Times that the  government had intended to curb the activities of Hamas in  Jordan without much publicity but was pressured to publicise  these measures after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin issued  a warning to Jordan charging that it was helping Hamas.    ""We had already instructed the minister of interior to deal  with the issue before Rabin had his press conference,"" the  senior official said.    Hamas representatives were not available for comment Monday,  but the movement issued a statement charging that Mr. Rabin was  ""creating fictitious conflicts to cover up for his political  failure.""    ""The prime minister of the enemy Yitzhaq Rabin has issued a  warning to Jordanin which he claimed that there is a leadership  for Hamas on its territory and demanding that the Jordanian  government take action against its activities,"" the statement  responded.    ""It is a failed attempt to use the confirmation by the Hamas  representatives in Amman of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's Brigades'  claim of responsibility for the heroic acts in 'Afula and  Hadera,"" the statement said.    ""Rabin and his government know very well that the  al-Qassam's  Brigades conduct, plan and execute their activities from the  occupied territories,"" the statement said, adding that ""his  failure to put an end to these attacks, and the revealing of his  deception in the settlement process has caused him to use these  attacks to issue a warning to Jordan.""    Hamas said that Mr. Rabin needed to warn Jordan to achieve  the following objectives:    -- Direct attention away from the failure of his security  measures and his oppressive measures in putting an end to the  heroic attacks by the al-Qassam Brigades.    -- Use the ""American sword"" to pressure Jordan towards  signing a unilateral agreement with his government similar to  the one signed in Oslo, and this warning falls in line with the  policy of the U.S. administration which uses the naval blockade  on al-'Aqabah as a way to pressure Jordan for the same purpose.    Despite the strong language against Israel and Mr. Rabin's  government, the Hamas statement appeared to set a precedent in  opening the door for bargaining with Israel.    Stressing that the attacks against Israeli civilians were in  retaliation against the Hebron massacre of Palestinian  worshippers, Hamas said that this was not a policy but the  ""exception.""    ""Hamas is ready to reconsider this exception on the  condition  that the enemy's prime minister, his government and his army  halt completely all killings of unarmed civilians from our  people,"" the statement said.    ""We are not against peace,"" the statement added,"" but the  peace offered by the government of the enemy is not peace but a  consolidation of occupation and the injustice falling on our  people.""    ""While we in Hamas know well that the Oslo agreement is  nothing but humiliating surrender from the PLO... we think that  the right beginning would be on the following foundations,"" the  statement added.    Hamas demanded the ""full Israeli withdrawal from our  Palestinian land and dismantling and removal of all settlements,  the holding of full and free elections in the West Bank and Gaza  to select the representatives of our people and their  leadership.""    ""The chosen leadership will be the one that represents the  aspirations and hopes of our people and will decide on the  ensuing steps,"" the statement concluded in what most analysts  termed as an indication that Hamas was proposing itself as an  alternative leadership to the Palestine Liberation Organisation,  through the results of the elections and by deduction the side  to conduct negotiations with Israel.

It was a just anti-imperialist, anti-fascist resistance to  thwart the criminal acts of the U.S. imperialists and their  servants the Chon Tu-hwan-No Tae-u fascist group and achieve  independence, democracy and reunification, and a mass armed  uprising in which the people fought a death-defying struggle in  the teeth of repression by huge armed forces.    NODONG SINMUN says the uprising left a precious lesson that  if the South Korean people are to smash the armed crackdown of  the oppressors and win a final victory, they must courageously  wage an all-people anti-U.S. struggle for independence to  terminate the colonial rule of the United States.    The news analyst says:    It was the lesson learned by the Kwangju resistance fighters  and South Korean people at the cost of blood and the sum total  of the struggle that as long as the United States occupies South  Korea and the flunkeyist traitors and bellicose elements remain  in power, independence, democracy and reunification cannot be  expected nor can the scourge of nuclear war be averted.    The South Korean students and people of all walks of life  must firmly unite under the banner of anti-imperialism and  independence and more vigorously wage the anti-U.S., anti-war  and anti-nuclear weapon struggle to overthrow the vicious  colonial rule of the United States, establish the sovereignty of  the nation, check and frustrate the nuclear war provocation  moves of the United States and realise peace and security.    All parties, groupings and people of South Korea and  overseas  compatriots must courageously wage a nationwide struggle to  reunify the country through a confederacy in accordance with the  ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation put  forward by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the lodestar  of national reunification, actively support the patriotic  proposal of the North for the convocation of a national  conference and turn out as one in the efforts to realise it.    An analyst of MINJU CHOSON warns that if the Kim Yong-sam  group fails to lend an ear to the voices of the people and  thoroughly and correctly solve the Kwangju problem, it will  encounter a greater resistance of the people.

0,FT924-11629 ,"FT924-11629 _AN-CJYAZACQFT 921024   FT  24 OCT 92 / Books: Hardy to the life      By WILLIAM ST CLAIR   THOMAS HARDY, HIS LIFE AND FRIENDS by F. B. Pinnion Macmillan, Pounds 45 438 pages THOMAS HARDY has shaped our view of England. Although he was a careful researcher, the Wessex of his novels was always more imaginary than historical, a fiction pieced together from memories of childhood and from stories of the heroic pre-railway days when the people of the coast lived under fear of a French invasion. Hardy broke for ever the townsman's idyll of simple happy country folk enjoying uneventful stress-free lives far from the madding crowd. Any Dorset village, with its loves, its jealousies, and its passions of revenge, its acts of arson, its murders and its hangings, could be a setting for tragedy as universal as ancient Thebes was for Sophocles. There are several biographies of Hardy, including one designed by himself as he prepared for the immortality which he knew awaited him. FB Pinion, in Thomas Hardy, His Life and Friends, distances himself from the extravagant tradition. His book sticks closely to the known facts, which he sets down in chronological order, the important and the trivial, with a minimum of explanation or speculation. Pinnion's main interest is to relate episodes in the novels (which he assumes the reader knows well) to real life incidents. He has a strong sense of place and provides detailed maps of the localities that fed the novelist's imagination. His book is accurate and comprehensive, but the style is flat and occasionally awkward. The few explanations that he ventures (for example that Hardy and the first Mrs Hardy would have got on better if they had had children) are timid, conventional, and unrelated to a considered view of Hardy's developing character. I particularly enjoyed the accounts of how Hardy's friends and editors tried to purge his stories of the very qualities which give them their power and their truth - the political correctness of the time. In one story Hardy was persuaded to change the time of his lovers' meetings from a Sunday to a Saturday. Leslie Stephen succeeded in removing an encounter from a churchyard, objecting to the use of the word 'amorous.' The Spectator damned one story for daring to suggest that 'an unmarried lady owning an estate could have an illegitimate child.' No wonder Hardy refused a knighthood.

With the help of God and the resolve of brave men, the units of  valiant Armed Forces--the forces of unity and constitutional  legitimacy--in the Lahij, Abyan, al-Bayda', and Ta'izz  Governorates continue their confrontations and successive  offensives against the units of the forces of evil, wickedness,  and apostasy, which have been controlled and commanded by the  rebellious, separatist elements in the Socialist Party command  since they exploded the military situation in a comprehensive  manner last night, beginning with the Dhamar and Aden  Governorates, and extending to other governorates.    The forces of constitutional legitimacy--the defenders of  unity and democracy--have inflicted successive defeats on all  the units that have been pushed into this losing and destructive  battle. They forced a large number of those forces to surrender  to the will of the people, the power of truth, and the heroism  of the forces defending unity and democracy. Other units have  surrendered of their own free will, declaring that they have  joined the trenches of constitutional legitimacy and the ranks  of the defenders of the people and the homeland and their great  achievements.    This morning, units from the Ba Suhayb Brigade Camp were  forced to surrender and join the ranks of constitutional  legitimacy and Yemeni unity.    With the same spirit of defending unity and democracy and  defeating the forces of treachery, apostasy, and separation, the  forces of the 2d Armored Brigade in the al-Rahah area continue  their great steadfastness, warding off all the fires of rancor,  which will be defeated, God willing.    In the al-Bayda' and Abyan Governorates, the forces of the  56th Brigade, 3d Armored Brigade, the 8th Special Forces  Brigade, and the al-Wahdah Brigades continue their determined,  capable advance as they confront the forces of separation in the  Mukayris area. They encircled and seized the 20th Brigade and  all its fortifications.    In the same spirit aiming at bolstering the people's unity  victory and defeating their treacherous enemies, the supported  [muda'am] 3d Infantry Brigade confronted the forces of apostasy  and separation in the camps of the al-Rahidah and Sarif areas.  They are now continuing their heroic and valiant advance to  achieve their mission.    In the city of Aden, our valiant heroes at the Central  Security Company in Khormaksar have continued their unique  heroic steadfastness in the face of the fierce large-scale  aggression carried out against them by a number of the rebelling  military units.    In the Ibb Governorate, the forces of the constitutional  legitimacy and Yemeni unity have continued their attack on the  units and brigades of the forces of apostasy and secession in  the al-Dali' region. The forces of the al-Hamzah Camp inflicted  heavy losses on the 'Abbud Brigade forces. Fighting is still  raging and the treacherous ones, aggressors, and those rebelling  against the constitutional legitimacy, of the enemies of the  people and unity, will receive their punishment.    Ever since last night, the al-'Amaliqah forces have been  heroically confronting the sea and air attacks against them in  the Abyan Governorate. They were able to repulse these attacks  and prevent them from achieving any of their objectives.    This morning, the capital, Sanaa, and the cities of Ta'izz  and al-Hudaydah witnessed air raids by the aircraft of the  rebelling secessionist forces, which targeted some vital and  strategic installations. These raids also targeted a number of  the military brigades in some governorates. The units of the  air defense forces confronted them and downed two aircraft  belonging to the rebelling secessionist gang in the al-Rahah  region, two aircraft in Mukayris, and another aircraft in  al-Rahidah.    Last night and this morning, large numbers of officers,  noncommissioned officers, and soldiers willingly handed  themselves over to the forces of the constitutional legitimacy,  announcing that they want to join these forces, and voicing  their rejection of the despicable secessionist conspiracy which  was hatched by the secessionist gang in the leadership of the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], headed by war criminal, traitor,  'Ali Salim al-Bid and his evil secessionist clique, against the  homeland and its unity, and against the people, their freedom,  and democracy. The expressed their denunciation of all the  criminal acts which resulted in this comprehensive military war  which was ignited by this rebelling clique, which will be  crushed, God willing.    In a subsequent statement, we will detail the names of these  units and the number of the officers, noncommissioned officers,  and soldiers who joined the forces of the constitutional  legitimacy and the trench of the Yemeni unity, the party of the  one Yemeni people, which is above all the sick parochial,  personal, and selfish loyalties, because it is the people's army  whose loyalty is to God, the homeland, the revolution, the  unity, and democracy.

Jiang Zemin and other  leading cadres of the CPC Central Committee and Central Military  Commission cordially met Xu Honggang and praised him warmly for  his heroic deeds. The General Political Department and the  Central Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly issued a  circular calling on the whole nation to emulate Xu Honggang.  Why did the deeds of an ordinary soldier produce such a strong  reaction and evoke such extensive echoes? In the final  analysis, it is because his magnificent feats reflect the  people's aspirations and respond to the call of the times.    Our era is a great one in which we have initiated the  brilliant cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The themes of our era comprise Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; the party's basic line; the ideology and spirit  of patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and revolutionary  heroism; an ideology and spirit that is beneficial to reform,  opening up, and modernization and national unity, social  progress, and the people's happiness; and the ideology and  spirit of striving for a happy life through honest labor. The  noble thoughts and heroic deeds of Xu Honggang are precisely a  resounding song with the main melody of the times. He rushed to  help comrades in danger or difficulty, earnestly practiced what  he advocated for the socialist cause, is irreconcilable towards  ugly phenomena, and persistently performs the duties of a  soldier. His thoughts and actions reflect the traditional  virtues of the Chinese nation, shining with the glow of  socialist ideology and morality, and mirror the fine traditions  of our party and Army, which shimmer with the brand new spirit  of the times. He boasts the common valuable character of the  heroes of the older generations as well as the distinguishing  features of a hero of the current generation. He is a brilliant  model of a soldier because of his courage in devoting himself to  a cause which is of universal significance to building up a  healthy social atmosphere. This is the basic reason why Xu  Honggang's deeds produced such a great appealing effect.    If any nation wants to be rejuvenated and any society wants  to make changes, it should portray heroes and heroic images  suitable to the requirements of the times so that people can be  inspired and motivated. Just as the years of the revolutionary  war called for heroic fighters to break through the brambles and  thorns and to charge and shatter enemy positions, today, the  accomplishment of the magnificent cause of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics likewise calls for heroic people to  lead the broad masses to forge ahead and the advanced elements  in society to take the lead in developing the ""five kinds of  revolutionary spirit"" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the  ""64-character pioneering spirit"" emphasized by Comrade Jiang  Zemin. They must have lofty ideals, take the overall interests  into consideration, be ready to dedicate themselves to a cause,  abide by social ethics, and have a high sense of responsibility,  a healthy tendency of fostering justice and combating evil, the  noble character of supporting those in danger and assisting  those in difficulty, and the pioneering spirit of keeping on  fighting in spite of all setbacks. With these, they can bring  about a fundamental improvement of social morality and promote  the constant advance of socialist spiritual civilization, so  that our undertaking of reform, opening up, and modernization  can march from victory to victory. This is precisely the social  cause of heroic people emerging in great multitudes, who,  singing the resonant songs of righteousness, have lived up to  the earnest expectations of the broad masses. The hero Xu  Honggang sprung up in response to the times.    Marxism tells us that the growth of a hero is closely  connected with the times he is in and the cause he takes up.  The great cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is one that calls for heroes, and the practice  of pioneering a cause to build socialism with Chinese  characteristics is a vast arena for bringing up heroes. In  tracing the footprint of Comrade Xu Honggang's growth, we can  clearly note that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics was the most valuable  nourishment for his mind; the fiery life of reform, opening up,  and the drive for modernization is an exceptionally fine  environment for his growth; the People's Army that boasts the  true character of the veteran Red Army and the tradition of  revolutionary heroism is a revolutionary furnace in which he is  tempered; and the spirit of the masses who work hard to change  the world in heading for a relatively comfortable life is the  source of strength that urges him to make advances. In short,  the spirit of our times, the fine tradition of our party, the  heroic character of our Army, and the traditional virtues of the  Chinese nation are all vividly reflected in him. It is an  essential demand of our times to bring up group after group of  heroic people like Xu Honggang. This represents the mainstream  of our times. In the high tide of reform and opening up, those  who indulge in money worship and pleasure- seeking and those  extreme individualists will certainly be eliminated by the  times, as they run counter to the historical trend.    In emulating Xu Honggang, we must act like him in responding  to the call of the times with our practical actions. Every  comrade should think over such a serious question: Can we do  what Xu Honggang has done under the same blue sky and on the  same earth? The great era of reform and opening up and the  magnificent practice of army modernization have provided  everyone with more or less the same environment for growth and  the same arena of life, but each person's performance in  response to the call of the times is entirely different. Why?  There are many aspects, and the most fundamental is whether he  can sincerely and realistically put into practice the spirit of  the times. Xu Honggang has done it honestly. He has armed his  own mind with the great theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, nurtured himself with the glorious  traditions of veteran Red Army men, portrayed his own image with  the noble spirit of serving the people with heart and soul, and  trained himself through his dedication to the arduous practice  of the national defense undertaking. Instead of uttering heroic  words, he cherishes lofty aspirations and is ready to be devoted  and to make sacrifices. It is precisely this spirit that makes  Xu Honggang a hero. When we learn from Xu Honggang, we should  particularly emulate this kind of spirit. With such a spirit,  anyone can be another Xu Honggang when he is called to take up  the cudgels for a just cause, another Su Ning when he is called  for to devote himself to the modernization of national defense,  another Huang Jiguang or Dong Cunrui when he is called to charge  the enemy lines, and another Lei Feng when he is called to make  contributions in an ordinary post.    Heroes are the pioneers of the times and models for the  masses. The more heroes like Xu Honggang we have, the more  cohesive our society will be, the stronger our Army's combat  capacity will become, and the more our cause will flourish. We  must enthusiastically respond to the call of Chairman Jiang and  the Central Military Commission; conscientiously put into effect  the guidelines of the circular jointly issued by the General  Political Department and the Communist Youth League Central  Committee; extensively and profoundly conduct activities of  emulating the hero Xu Honggang; bring up more new socialist  personalities with lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and  a sense of discipline; and repeatedly push forward the building  of a revolutionized, modernized, and regularized Army!

The validity and vitality of the work finds clear  manifestation, firsts of all, in that the Korean people are  staunchly defending the revolutionary cause of chuche,  frustrating all manner of challenges and aggressive moves of the  imperialists.    They are resolutely upholding the banner of socialism by  fully displaying the heroic fighting spirit and traits with an  unshakable faith in the socialist cause of chuche.    The validity and vitality of the work also finds clear  manifestation in that the Korean people are consolidating and  developing Korean-style socialism by effecting a constant  upsurge in the revolution and construction through an all-people  heroic struggle.    With the chuche-orientation, modernization and  scientification of the national economy, a strategic line of  socialist economic construction, accelerated successfully, the  nation's economy has been further strengthened as an independent  socialist national economy with all its sections including  industry and agriculture equipped with modern technologies and  the departmental structures rounded off.    The officers and men of the People's Army and the People's  Security Forces have brought about an unprecedented renovative  upswing in combat and political training and construction of  major projects, upholding the idea and intention of supreme  commander General Kim Chong-il on living and fighting like  heroes.    The Korean people and all the soldiers will as ever cherish  the idea and theory and policies expounded in the work as their  faith and thoroughly apply them to practice and thereby  determinedly smash any challenge and aggressive move of the  enemy and staunchly defend and accomplish the socialist cause of  chuche.

Today, we are having celebrations in ""Mariana Grajales""  Revolutionary Plaza, in front of the monument to this mother of  the fatherland -- this exemplary woman who wrote a unique epic  for her people with her life and the lives of her children, whom  she fed with the milk of heroism.    What better place is there than this one, where Mariana  calls  on us to kneel and swear to defend the freedom of the fatherland  or to die for it, and where she orders us to stand up and march  to Camp Mambi, like she did with all her children, even the  youngest one?    And what better territory is there than this one, the heroic  east, birthplace of our revolutions, Guantanamo Province, where  there is no beach, path, valley, or mountain that does not  deserve glorious mention in our country's history?    For the glorious deeds of the Mambises people in last  century's three wars against the colonial yoke.    For the most tenacious and successful struggle by peasants  for their land, the 18 possessions of the crown [el realengo 18].    For the solid support that it gave our guerrilla column to  found and extend the 2d ""Frank Pais"" Eastern Front, giving us  its best sons, sending us ammunition and all sorts of supplies,  surrounding us for nine months with their uncompromising support  until the 1 January triumph.    For its contribution to the victory at the Bay of Pigs.  Perhaps not enough has been divulged about the fact that the  mercenaries sent to land on the coast of Baracoa were to open a  front to divert us from the main thrust of the attack, but they  did not dare step on Guantanamo soil, where a decided and alert  people in arms were waiting to annihilate them.    Faithful to their tradition of rising to the occasion in the  face of danger and adversity, the people of Guantanamo, under  government and party leadership headed by Comrade Juan Carlos  Robinson, faced with courage, energy, and efficiency the  devastating effects of the November floods. With the solidarity  of the whole country and with state support they made their  repairs in silence. Here, nature's catastrophe has served as an  encouragement to work, and it has not been used as an excuse to  not fulfill production plans or defense tasks.    We are also gathered to promote to higher ranks 33  militiamen  and reservists deployed in this province, who symbolize the 33  years that separate us from the heroic Bay of Pigs and represent  all of those throughout the country who today receive this  well-deserved encouragement.    We are also gathered to hand over a replica of Maximo  Gomez's  glorious machete -- as in previous years -- to a group of  writers, journalists, artists, and cultural institutions on  behalf of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in recognition of their  outstanding contribution to strengthening the country's combat  capabilities and our people's patriotic and internationalist  awareness.    It is of great satisfaction to decorate, in keeping with the  Council of State decree, the heroic fighters and civilian  workers of the border brigade, who in keeping with their duty,  have many times risked their lives or have been mutilated in the  minefields that surround the territory illegally occupied by the  United States. To those who have fallen while fulfilling this  risky mission, to First Lieutenant Arturo Ruiz Martinez, and to  soldiers Raul Milanes Labrada, Roberto Navarro Hernandez, and  Wilbert Vazquez Gamboa, I posthumously confer today the ""Antonio  Maceo"" order.    They have offered up their budding lives, these brave  youths,  worthy followers of soldiers Ramon Lopez Pena and Luis Ramirez  Lopez, who in past decades lost their lives because of  treacherous bullets fired from the other side of the fence. The  sacrifice of those who have been wounded or mutilated forever,  the hard test of thousands of fighters and officers, who  throughout the 30 years since the border unit was created have  repeatedly guarded the fatherland, risking dangers and suffering  the tensions of the border along the front -- all of this is  part of the high price we are forced to pay because of the  existence of this foreign military base on a part of our soil.    We have said and reiterated, from the very triumph of the  revolution, that this base was imposed on the Cuban people by  force, and we demand that it be dismantled and returned to Cuba.  Its presence, in disregard of our people's manifest rights and  their legitimate government, violates all norms of international  law. It is a brutal act of arrogance by the empire.    Today this base, which is obsolete from a military  viewpoint,  constitutes an unnecessary expense that must be borne by the  U.S. taxpayer.    To reduce its uncontrollable military budget, the United  States has dismantled dozens of military installations in the  United States and abroad. Nevertheless, it maintains this one  as a source of constant provocation and humiliation against Cuba.    We will never renounce our sovereign right to this part of  our island -- this part of our national territory.    We reiterate today what we expressed nearly a year ago in  this same plaza: There is not one day in which we are not  reminded that we have a dagger stuck in our country's side, just  a few kilometers south of where we are now standing. We have  never stopped believing that some day we may be able to remove  this dagger in a peaceful and civilized manner in accordance  with the principles of international law.    As everyone knows, our state's social system, as well as our  military doctrine, dictates that we shall never become an  aggressor that fires the first shot.    Everything we do to strengthen our defense is precisely  aimed  at making any aggression against our country a costly  enterprise. Our defensive efforts constitute a deterrent that  will make any war prohibitively costly and unwinnable and, at  the same time, guarantee our people's peaceful and creative  endeavors.    As long as we fail to achieve this legitimate and unyielding  aspiration of recovering the territory now occupied by this  base, our position is to avert incidents along the demarcation  line between this area and the rest of the island.    As we stated several weeks ago, during the past year a  climate of tranquillity has prevailed on both sides of the  fence, and we are inclined to keep doing all that is necessary  to maintain this atmosphere.    This is why we have taken and will continue to take all  necessary measures to prevent any foolish attempts by those who  want to leave the country by way of this route.    To try to cross through those densely mined fields on both  sides of the fence, attempting to evade our checkpoints and  patrols, is madness and, at the same time, an act of provocation  against our country's security.    Two armies are deployed face to face on either side of the  fence. Given the United State's permanent hostility toward our  country and its illegal occupation of this part of Cuba, these  two armies are not exactly friendly armies.     "

Our Armed Forces in the southwest axis captured the 25th  Mechanized Brigade, stationed in the (?Faz) garrison, and seized  all its tanks, artillery, equipment, and vehicles. A number of  this brigade's officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers  surrendered to the ranks of Constitutional legitimacy who are  protecting Yemeni unity. In the same axis, in the  al-'Anad-(?al- Hawdah) sector, our Armed Forces inflicted on the  forces hostile to legitimacy and Yemeni unity huge losses in  equipment and weapons. In the al-Dali'-al-'Anad sector, the  Armed Forces continued their advance accomplishing their tasks  successfully.    In the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces affiliated with the  separatist forces -- which are hostile to unity and democracy  and which are devoted to serving the illegitimate desires of the  members of the bloody gang in the YSP leadership -- sustained  huge losses in equipment, weapons, and vehicles. These forces  retreated to rear positions after failing to carry out desperate  attacks.    Meanwhile, the heroes in the Armed Forces Air Defense in all  axes confronted the air raids carried out by the aircraft of the  forces of apostasy, which are hostile to the people and  Constitutional legitimacy, forcing these planes to flee. This  made the criminal secessionist forces resort to crazy methods,  which reveal their grudge, hysteria, and death throes, by firing  a number of missiles at peaceful populated cities and civilian  facilities, including the firing of two Scud missiles at Sanaa  early yesterday morning. One of these missiles fell in a big  residential area. This shows the state of hysteria and  cowardliness in which the igniters of the war are living as well  as their realization of the fate they will face soon, God  willing, now that their treacherous objectives of this war have  been aborted. Unity has been entrenched through the blood and  sacrifices of our valiant heroes in our Armed Forces and  Security Forces and by their great heroism in embodying their  loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, unity, and  democracy. Unity has also been entrenched through the entire  people's solidarity with their leadership and their righteous  sons in the Armed Forces and Security Forces in the battle aimed  at defending life and their great national and popular  achievements, championing the loftiest values and pan-Arab and  human principles of justice, and at making the rebels, the  enemies of people, homeland, legitimacy, and Constitutional  institutions taste the consequences of their acts and tyranny,  God willing.    God's victory is imminent.    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you  will aid the cause of God, He will aid you and plant your feet  firmly. [Koranic verse]     "

The heroic mujahidin also distributed leaflets denouncing  the  regime and calling on the Iraqi masses to assist the mujahidin  in their heroic operations against the regime's mercenaries and  henchmen.

The regime has taken repressive measures  against Army deserters but the measures have proved futile.    Elsewhere, the so-called emergency forces [quwwat  al-tawari']  have been deployed in every governorate. These forces, under  the pretext of training, have carried out successive sweeps in  residential areas in various governorates according to a weekly  timetable. Our sources in the south say that random arrests  accompany the sweeps and that hundreds of innocent youths have  been detained. In one incident, the emergency forces demolished  a house after coming under fire and failing to determine the  source. The incident occurred in the Nadir al-Thalith district  of al-Hillah.    A kangaroo court of the tyrant's regime has handed down  sentences of 10-20 years to the remaining detainees who were  still on trial in connection with the Sha'ban [March 1991]  uprising. The detainees have been transferred to the notorious  Abu-Ghurayb Prison.

Brother dear citizens: On this venerable day of faith, in  which the magnificence of the shining picture of the Islamic  nation manifests itself, represented in the guests of God  visiting the holy places and taking up position in common  worship to the one God on the blessed Mount 'Arafat, and in the  apex of great rites that almost count as the complete pilgrimage  to quote Prophet Muhammad, who said that to climb Mount 'Arafat  amounts to a complete pilgrimage. This is because standing on  Mount 'Arafat [word indistinct] is an important religous event,  where the sentiments of all Muslims gravitate [word indistinct]  the close bond that does not unravel, and that makes us stick  more firmly to it and believe more in the justice of the  virtuous Islamic faith. We thank God for his guidance.    On the occasion of the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Adha, I  take pleasure to send my sincere, heartfelt congratulations to  all members of our people and Arab and Islamic nations, hoping  that when the occasion next comes round all of us will be in the  happiest state possible. This 'Id confirms great values of  sacrifice and self-denial that are today manifest in the heroic  acts of the courageous and faithful sons of our believing and  proud people in the Armed Forces and Security Forces as they  fight battles of sacrifice and self-denial and stand up to  rebellious and secessionist gangs within the leadership of the  Yemeni Socialist Party and display the finest examples of  sacrifice with all courage and chivalry and dedication to the  sacred duty. To them in particular, I send my warmest greetings  on the occasion of 'Id al- Adha [word instinct] what they have  always done in the areas of sacrifice and self-denial and  standing up to the enemies of the people and the homeland and  the enemies of principles, ideals, and values.    Thanks to them, our people have been able to ward off the  dangers that were ignited by the rebellious secessionists,  threatening the homeland's unity and safety. They have  extinguished the fire of those dangers before they became an  overall national ordeal, thus bolstering and fortifying the  people's unity, increasing the firmness of the people's faith in  democracy, and enhancing faith in the present and future of the  new Yemen, the Yemen of unity, freedom, and democracy, the Yemen  of wellbeing, justice, and prosperity.    On this occasion, we beseech Almighty God to have bountiful  mercy on all the martyrs of our people, the martyrs of the  revolution, unity, and democracy, and to elevate their souls to  highest ranks among the prophet's companions and martyrs. We  beseech God to accept the prayers of the pilgrims to holy Mecca,  to guide our steps, and to lead us along the path that pleases  Him. God is all-hearing, ready to answer. Many happy returns.

The joint meeting was due to be held in Pyongyang and  Kwangju  of South Korea at the same time today on the patriotic  initiative of the General Student Council of Chonnam National  University to realize the noble aspirations of the participants  in the uprising.    Speaking at the meeting here, Pak Chang-kwang, vice-chairman  of the Student Committee Kim Chaek University of Technology, and  others said although the Kwangju popular uprising which started  because of the frantic repressive offensive by the U.S.  imperialists and their stooges, the remnants of ""Yusin"", failed  due to brutal armed suppression by the oppressors, it was a just  patriotic resistance which recorded a most brilliant chapter in  the South Korean students and people's history of anti-U.S.,  anti-fascist struggle and the biggest massive uprising  unprecedented in the modern history of national liberation  struggle.    They pointed out that the noble desire of the participants  in  the Kwangju popular uprising for independence, democracy and  reunification has not been realized although 14 years have  passed since the uprising and the rancour of thousands of  Kwangju citizens who were murdered in cold blood has not been  wreaked.    Noting that the U.S. imperialists were pushing the situation  on the Korean peninsula to a touch-and-go phase of nuclear war  on the pretext of the fictitious ""nuclear issue"" of the DPRK,  they said the South Korean students and people should wage a  more unremitting anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle to  get the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and their nuclear  weapons withdrawn from South Korea and smash their nuclear war  provocation moves.    They stressed that the entire students of the university  would join hands firmly with the fellow students of Chonnam  National University in South Korea and wage a vigorous struggle  to achieve national unity and make a breakthrough in the  reunification of the country, upholding the ""10-point programme  of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of  the country"" advanced by the great leader President Kim Il-song.    A declaration on the establishment of sisterly relations and  a resolution on the joint struggle against the U.S. imperialists  and for the resignation of Kim Yong-sam were read at the  meeting.    The resolution says they, as students responsible for the  future of the country and the nation, cannot remain a mere  onlooker to the aggressive and treacherous acts of the United  States and its stooges. It indicates common fighting goals of  the students of Kim Chaek University of Technology and Chonnam  National University to decisively counter them.    The declaration says the students in the North and the South  would develop independent exchange and contribute to achieving  the great unity of the whole nation, assume their looks as  students of the generation of reunification and contribute to  the reunification of the country in '95.

0,FT922-5589 ,"FT922-5589 _AN-CE2ATAFOFT 920529   FT  29 MAY 92 / Arts: Sviatoslav Richter      By ANDREW CLEMENTS   The pianist was scheduled to give two recitals in London's Festival Hall this week, as part of a British tour which has taken him to Oxford (where he was awarded an honorary doctorate) and which also includes Harrogate, Birmingham, Cheltenham and Aldeburgh. Sunday's programme of Bach and Brahms was cancelled at three hours' notice - the pianist was suffering from heat exhaustion. However, on Wednesday he did appear, playing to a darkened auditorium as he always does nowadays, his scores spread before him and illuminated by a single lamp. Richter is 77; the stern, measured platform manner has not wavered. He has always been the most introspective of pianists, but, if anything, his playing appears to have become even more inward-looking and intimate over the years. It is less concerned than ever with projecting grand dramatic schemes, much more focused on a minutely nuanced exploration of phrase structure and expressive meaning. If his sheer technical power seems fractionally more effortful than in the past, the range of colour, touch and articulation remains unequalled. Haydn's F minor Andante con variazioni and Beethoven's Sonata Op. 110 made up the first half of Wednesday's programme. The Haydn was presented at a lithe, moderate pace - for this most Schubertian of Haydn's works one had half expected Richter to settle into his most leisurely Schubertian mode. Each half of the main theme was coloured and flecked with glistening detail, the tiniest of rhythmic emphases, and there was never any doubt about the point and purpose of every single phrase. The sonata offered countless points for contemplation, especially the weighty, deliberate tempo for the scherzo, certainly not the allegro molto of standard usage, yet chiming precisely with the pulsing accompaniment to the main theme of the following Adagio, and the extraordinary, unearthly progression, half muffled, half percussive, that marked the mid-point of the final fugue, in which every voice had its own colour, character and purpose. After the interval, Richter started with Chopin's Polonaise-Fantaisie in a performance almost entirely purged of rhetoric, as if conceived for a handful of friends in a quiet dacha, its focus switched entirely from heroic gestures to the meditations of its lyrical core. He then moved on through Skryabin to Debussy. The Skryabin performances (the two Mazurkas of Op. 40 and the Poeme-Nocturne Op. 61) were astonishing acts of re-creation, poetic fantasies that hardly seemed to touch solid ground for a moment. Debussy's L'Isle joyeuse was warmed into life with infinite patience, the edges of its rhythmic shapes gradually hardened, the colours moving from indistinct greys to bright primaries. More Debussy was offered as an encore: 'La cathedrale engloutie' from the first book of Preludes, a sequence of veiled perspectives, controlled with absolute precision. No one plays Debussy's piano music like Richter; no one combines his musical insights with the complete technical command to realise them exactly. But then, no one plays most of the piano repertory as he does, with such love and supreme intelligence.  The Financial Times   London Page 15  "

""I thought they were going to kill him,"" said Hooks, who had been watching from  the restaurant where she worked as a waitress. ""He had the prettiest face, but  he was purple. I kept thinking, 'That could be my brother.' ""    Hooks ran after one of the bad guys until reality caught up with her on that  warm, humid evening of April 20, 1986. Alone and shaking in an alley, she  abandoned the chase, threw up in the bushes and hurried home to bed.    Nevertheless, the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission proclaimed her a hero, and a  forever-grateful Officer James Whitley sent her flowers.    Hooks is one of 7,313 adults and children who have been honored by the  commission since its founding in 1904 by industrialist Andrew Carnegie, who was  moved by the bravery displayed following a mine explosion near Pittsburgh.      Cash and a Medal    Carnegie heroes receive $2,500 and a bronze medal on which is inscribed the New  Testament verse: ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his  life for his friends.""    The self-effacing Hooks, who moved out of Texas shortly after the fracas  because one of the attackers remained at large, says she is uncomfortable being  called a hero.    ""That was the way I was brought up,"" said Hooks, now 31 and living in  Charlotte, N. C. ""If you saw someone who needed help, you just helped them. You  don't think about it, you just do it.""    To Whitley, however, Hooks and another waitress who came to his rescue deserve  the honor.    ""I couldn't believe they tried to help me like that, when they could have  easily gotten killed or hurt,"" said Whitley, 28, who is still on the Houston  police force.    ""I probably wouldn't be here today if not for them.""    In establishing the fund, which he endowed with $5 million, Carnegie said he  wasn't trying to ""create heroism . . . knowing well that heroic action is  impulsive.""      Insurance for Courage    He also said he wanted to make sure heroes or their survivors would not ""suffer  pecuniarily"" as a result of their deeds.    Paying for pensions, scholarships and funeral expenses ""is where Carnegie has  its real punch,"" commission spokesman Walter Rutkowski said.    In 85 years, more than 63,000 people have been nominated for heroism awards,  but just 7,313 of them, or about 11%, were chosen to receive them.    ""We are up to our whatever in nominees,"" said Rutkowski, whose office in  downtown Pittsburgh is watched over by a somber portrait of Carnegie. ""We give  away as many awards as we have cases that meet our requirements.""    Nominees are scrutinized by three investigators before the commission's  21-member executive committee votes.      Just the Facts    Like Sgt. Joe Friday of ""Dragnet,"" the Carnegie investigators want to know just  the facts.    ""In a drowning case, we go for the water temperature, the distance of the swim,  the current and the rescuer's swimming ability,"" Rutkowski said. ""We don't get  into a person's psyche.    ""You cannot get emotionally tied up with these cases. You just don't have the  capacity to see these cases other than clinically. It's like a doctor in the  operating room. You don't want him to weep over the pain you're in.""    Candidates are excluded from consideration if they are obligated to act because  of their occupation, such as lifeguard or firefighter. A rescue of a family  member also is excluded, unless the rescuer was severely injured or killed.    Above all, the saved person must have been in imminent danger of losing his  life, and the hero must have risked his life in performing the rescue. Also,  the deed must have taken place in the United States or Canada.      Posthumous Honors, Pensions    More than 1,500 Carnegie heroes, or roughly 21%, died performing their rescues.  Most of the heroic acts involve drownings or fires.    Surprisingly, perhaps, a nominee can still be chosen for the honor even if the  life-saving attempt failed.    ""It may sound crass, but we're not interested in the victim so much as the  rescuer,"" Rutkowski said. ""We're not a lifesaving award. We give awards to  those who risk their own lives to save others.""    Carnegie heroes range in age from 8 to 80 and 91% have been males. Most are  modest people who are hard-pressed to explain what prompted their actions, the  investigators say.    ""I don't think anyone can truthfully claim to understand why anyone stands by  or gets involved,"" said Marlin Ross, a Carnegie investigator since 1983.      Acting by Instinct    To Carnegie hero Robert Jameson, a heroic act is done by instinct.    ""If you don't react immediately, you're going to be overwhelmed by what  happens. You'll just freeze,"" said Jameson, 36, of Roebling, N. J., who last  April saved a woman from a knife-wielding attacker.    ""It has nothing to do with bravery,"" said Andrew Mathieson, 60, of Pittsburgh,  who was shot three times while defending his secretary, Jane Celender, on Feb.  19, 1986.    ""If you ask if I would attack a 210-pound man holding a gun, I would say, 'No,  not consciously,' but if the circumstances would develop the same way again, I  would probably do the same thing,"" he said. ""I think the real brave people are  those who have time to consider what they're going to do and still do it.""    Mary Ann Anderson, whose father, John, died trying to save a boy from drowning  in Lake Michigan on July 17, 1987, said she has met several Carnegie heroes and  all share one trait.      Concern for Others    ""They all have this fundamental concern for people, that what you do in life  does matter and affect others,"" said Anderson, 24, of Baldwin, Mich.    ""Everyone wants to believe the best of them will come out, but no one knows  what you are going to do in a situation like that. You either panic or you do  something. It's your inner soul taking over.""    Anderson's death left not only an emotional void in his family's life but also  a financial one. His three children were in college at the time, and there was  little money to pay the bills.    The Carnegie commission stepped in, paid the funeral expenses, set up a monthly  stipend for Anderson's wife, Louise, and contributed scholarship money.    ""It was a blessing,"" said Louise Anderson, 42, a schoolteacher in Baldwin.  ""There were many bleak times when I didn't know if I was going to be able to  make the bills.""    Of the 105 beneficiaries currently receiving pensions, Evelyn Sponsler of  Everett, Pa., has been on the books the longest.      Pension Saved Family    For 58 years she and her disabled daughter have been supported by a Carnegie  pension awarded when her husband, Clarence, died trying to rescue a man who was  overcome by fumes when he fell into a gasoline storage tank.    ""I probably would have had to live on welfare without it,"" said Sponsler, 82,  who had three young children at the time her husband died.    Last year, the commission gave out $236,000 in pensions. About $372,000 went  toward the $2,500 hero awards, funeral expenses and to 20 scholarship  recipients.    What the hero often does not receive is praise from the person saved,  commission investigators say.    Jameson said the woman he saved never thanked him, but he can understand why.    ""This was a very violent thing that happened to her,"" he said. ""She just wants  to put it in her past and forget about it.""    Jane Celender, 42, the Pittsburgh secretary who owes her life to Mathieson's  quick actions, said that thanks seemed inadequate.    ""How can you say thank you for your life?"" she asked.

The forces  of the bloody military gang of al-Ahmar have continued to direct  artillery, rocket, and aircraft fire on al-Dali and the villages  around it, and to confront our forces, who are supported by the  citizenry.    For the ninth time, units from the Republican Guards, the  central security forces, the 8th Independent Armored Brigade,  and the al-Hamzah Brigade have attacked, in an attempt to break  through the our forces' defensive positions -- they were  repulsed and sent back to where they came from. Members of  these units surrendered and joined our forces, having realized  the falsity of the slogans concerning the defense of  constitutionality and unity being prattled by the influential  al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa.    In Qa'tabah and Karish, our heroic defending forces repulsed  the forces of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan, which had continued  its efforts to break through our forces' defensive positions,  directing intensive artillery and rocket fire against the  villages and houses of innocent civilians. This was an attempt  to erode the high morale characterizing the heroic defenders and  the masses of the people of Karish, known for their outstanding  role in the struggle during all stages of the revolution, and in  the defense of unity.    In the capital of Abyan Governorate, units from the Amaliqah  forces have suffered repeated defeats and have surrendered, with  many of their men joining the ranks of our forces. Our forces,  after reinforcing the encirclement of their positions, succeeded  in storming their positions, even after they sought shelter in  the houses, schools, and fields of citizens. At noon today the  commanding officer of the 54th Battalion of the Amaliqah forces,  Colonel Ahmad Salim al-Nahmi, surrendered, together with what  was left of the officers and men of his battalion. They joined  the ranks of our forces which, supported by the sons of  Zinjibar, Ji'ar, and the surrounding villages, are continuing  their operations to take full control of the situation in this  governorate.

The discussions focused on the security  situation in the country and the results of the security  measures that have been taken in all Lebanese areas in the wake  of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre in Zuq Mikha'il, the  attempt to bomb the French cultural center in Ghadir, and the  wave of rumors that accompanied these developments. Attending  the meeting were Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul; Interior  Minister Bisharah Mirhij; Major General Rafiq al-Hasan, Internal  Security Forces director general; Public Security Director  General Raymond Rufayil; Maj.

Attending the meeting were the defense minister, interior  minister, the public prosecutor, the legal investigator into the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church bombing, the commanders of the security  agencies, and the envoy of the Syrian security and intelligence  department operating in Lebanon. During the meeting, the  conferees reviewed the security situation in the country, the  results of security investigations, and the accompanying sweeps  and detentions. The meeting addressed the following topics:    1. The meeting reviewed the results of the investigations by  the security agencies of the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat  Church and the ensuing sweeps and detentions that targeted  suspects and other defendants in bombings, according to legal  arrest warrants. These sweeps covered most Lebanese areas and  camps without discrimination from Sidon to 'Akkar. The sweeps,  which were carried out by all Lebanese security agencies and  occasionally backed by units of the Syrian Arab forces, resulted  in the arrest of 127 people.    2. The conferees stressed the Lebanese people's right to  resist the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon and western  al-Biqa', noting the importance of the resistance's heroic acts  that undermined the Israeli enemy army and its agents in the  border strip. The conferees then discussed the ramifications of  the appearance of gunmen in Ba'labakk on Friday [11 March],  which is considered to be a flagrant violation of the law. They  also reviewed the measures taken by the military public  prosecution office against those who broke the law, particularly  since the negative effects of these violations overshadowed the  measures of the security agencies tasked with investigating the  bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church.    3. His Excellency the prime minister stressed the need for  the security agencies to continue their interrogations and  security measures until the networks of terrorism and sabotage,  which threaten the country's security, are uncovered,  particularly since the Lebanese judiciary supervises all these  measures. Al-Hariri pointed out that the general amnesty law  pardons former criminals but does not prevent the security  agencies from investigating previous or subsequent crimes to  preserve the country's security. The public attorney said that  the general amnesty law was based on the principle that amnesty  can be rescinded if a person commits new crimes similar to  previous ones. Accordingly, all these criminals remain under  watch and can be hunted down for all crimes, including the  pardoned ones. At the end of the meeting, al-Hariri expressed  his satisfaction with the work of the security agencies and  urged them to continue their work and be strict in their  interrogations and measures against all violators and criminals,  no matter to which party they belong.

Masses of our militant Palestinian people, sons of our people in  the diaspora, sons of our Arab and Islamic nation, and free men  of the world, 30 March 1994 is the 18th anniversary of Land Day.  Our heroic Palestinian people are facing the ugliest conspiracy  to liquidate their national cause through the Oslo and Cairo  agreements in which 'Arafat gave in to all the Zionist-U.S.  dictates and conditions, relinquished the Palestinian people's  historical and national rights, and canceled all their  sacrifices over 70 years.    The Land Day anniversary this year falls on the 40th day of  the massacre in the Ibrahimi mosque in steadfast Hebron. This  massacre highlighted the reality and essence of the  Zionist-'Arafatist peace when scores of glorious martyrs fell,  and hundreds were wounded. The fascist Zionist army followed  this with other massacres in the same city and the other  occupied territories in response to the wave of popular wrath  that unfolded throughout the occupied territories and which  resulted in more heroes, martyrs, and wounded.    This anniversary this year also coincides with the uprising  of our militant masses in the 1948 occupied territories. This  confirms the unity of our people, the unity of their land and  fate, and their endless readiness for struggle to foil all the  Zionist schemes to liquidate their national cause.    Masses of our people, and sons of the land: This land has  been yours since time immemorial. The signature of a defeatist  traitor will not constitute an edict that changes the name of  the owner of the land. The land is yours, and yours is the sea,  the river, the valley, and the mountain. Yours are the oranges,  grapes, figs, and olives.    O Hebron, the deep wound of Palestine, the mother of  martyrs,  we shed tears on your doorstep but we will not give in. The  pledge remains as it. O Hebron, you remain in the lap of  Palestine and in the heart of the nation. The series of  massacres the occupation army has carried out and is  perpetrating under direct orders from Rabin -- 'Arafat's partner  in the Washington, Oslo, Taba, Cairo agreement -- have stepped  up the Palestinian popular call for the resignation of 'Arafat  and his deviationist clique, for halting the farce of  negotiations, and for toppling the U.S.-Zionist settlement  course. The massacres have also led to the stepping up of calls  for the withdrawal of the negotiating delegation, for the  dismantling of the settlements, for international protection for  the sons of our people throughout the entire occupied  territories, for their right to determine their fate on their  national soil, and for toppling the deviationist clique and its  main emblem, which have placed our people and cause in this  dilemma. The recent agreement with the Zionist enemy has  constituted a cover for the Hebron massacre and what took place  before it. All this confirms the unequivocal fact that  coexistence with this enemy is impossible and that the struggle  against it will continue.    O people of Palestine inside and in the diaspora, o people  of steadfast and mujahid Hebron: The popular situation caused  by the massacre, and the militant momentum the heroic intifadah  is witnessing -- in spite of the comprehensive siege and  systematic acts of mass killing at the hands of Rabin's army  gangs, 'Arafat's partner -- force the Palestinian and Arab  nationalist and Islamic forces to understand the features of  this stage and to work to develop struggle and jihad to higher  and more effective standards on the ground. They must close  ranks and adopt militant programs inside and outside the  occupied territories in order to pull the rug out from under the  feet of the capitulative leadership, to confront the onslaught,  to restore respect to struggle and jihad, to put to use the  furious popular sentiment, and to work to topple 'Arafat and his  deviationist and relinquishing clique on the path of continued  struggle and jihad in order to realize all objectives of the  Palestinian people to attain full liberation and independence.    Our observation of Land Day and the 40th day since the  martyrdom at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque reemphasizes our  adherence to the unity of the people, the unity of land, and the  unity of blood that we will not relinquish no matter what the  pressures, difficulties, and obstacles might be. We pledge to  the souls of the martyrs -- the martyrs of Land Day in the  Galilee, and the martyrs of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron -- to remain faithful to their pure blood. We in the APF  [Alliance of Palestinian Forces] emphasize that there will be no  peace in the region without the collapse of the sin represented  in the presence of Israel in the heart of our Arab and Islamic  nation. We promise our people that we will carry out serious  and unionist actions, burn the occupied land under the  occupiers' feet, and topple the symbols of relinquishment,  capitulation, and treason.    On these two anniversaries, we ask our people to carry out  the following activities:    1. In the occupied territories: To escalate the intifadah  and emphasize the unity of land and people.    2. In the diaspora: To observe a general and full strike on  Wednesday morning 30 March 1994 in all camps and Palestinian  residential areas in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. To stage a  sit-in in front of the offices of the International Committee of  the Red Cross in the diaspora countries on the morning of 5  April. We also call on the masses of our people to participate  in the popular rally the APF will sponsor at al-Nujum Cinema in  al-Yarmuk Camp, southern Damascus, at 1800 on Tuesday 5 April  1994, and to take part in all rallies that will be held in  Amman, Beirut, Aleppo, Hims, and all Palestinian camps.    O relatives of noble martyrs: Your martyrs are in heaven and  will be a mercy for you and the nation. They will remain in the  hearts.

Inscriptions from Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, and Zhang Zhen  for the ""heroic battalion"" were read at the gathering.    On behalf of the Central Military Commission and the General  Staff Department, the General Political Department, and the  General Logistics Department, Chief of General Staff Zhang  Wannian warmly congratulated the meeting's opening. Zhou Ziyu,  deputy director of the General Political Department, presented  the ""heroic battalion"" with gifts and a bronze board inscribed  with ""The Powerful Guardians of the Nation's Airspace"" on it.    The ""heroic battalion"" is a heroic military unit with a high  fighting will, tough fighting skills, and a tenacious fighting  style. [passage omitted] The battalion, after rendering  meritorious services for the motherland and the people by  shooting down four enemy U-2 strategic and pilotless  high-altitude reconnaissance planes, was given the honorary  title of ""heroic battalion"" in June 1964 by the National Defense  Ministry. [passage omitted]    In his speech, Zhang Wannian called on officers and men to  learn from the ""heroic battalion""; from their resoluteness in  listening to the party, their high sense of political awareness  and strict organizational discipline in following the command of  the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission  for all their actions; from their spirit of a high degree of  responsibility toward state security; from their fearlessness  before difficulties; from their indomitable spirit; from their  efforts to master modern scientific knowledge; from their  hard-trained military skills; and from their raising the unit's  fighting strength through rigorous and scientific training.  Zhang Wannian added that if we want to fulfill the important  mission entrusted by the party and the people, we need to build  hundreds and thousands of fighting collectives in the style of  the ""heroic battalion."" In particular, we need to give play to  the heroic battalion's revolutionary and heroic spirit of ""dare  to struggle, dare to win, and dare to crush all enemies"" and to  constantly advance our army's modernization cause. He stressed  the need for army commanders and fighters to rally closely round  the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission  with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; to be guided by Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and by the party's basic line; to greatly  develop the old Red Army's excellent tradition and the spirit of  revolutionary heroism; to be tenacious; to be enterprising; and  to strive to build our army into a strong, modernized, and  regularized revolutionary army.    Air Force Political Commissar Ding Wenchang also spoke at  the  meeting.     "

There are tides in the affairs of science that reflect and at times even  predict the greater tides in society at large. Optimism about our biological  and psychological potential for salvation may be the theme of the 1990s.  Experienced science writers Morton Hunt and Alfie Kohn have produced,  independently, popular books about the human capacity for empathy, altruism,  and what they define as ""pro-social"" behavior. In other words, we have two  volumes demonstrating that people can be good, and with some encouragement, can  be even better.    Hunt's ""The Compassionate Beast"" and Kohn's ""The Brighter Side of Human Nature""  refer, on the whole, to the same cluster of psychological and sociological  studies that affirm the existence of altruism as an integral part of human  behavior. Why do people dive into rushing water, give blood anonymously or risk  their lives and those of their families to protect strangers? There is no quid  pro quo for these acts, and like the rescuers who drowned in the Sierras this  winter trying to save the young campers who fell through the ice, there were no  familial ties between the victims and their would-be saviors. The answer seems  to be that they felt the threat as if threatened themselves and acted to ease  the pain.    Hunt's book is less ambitious than Kohn's and a great deal more accessible. By  dramatizing not only the heroics of memorable altruists but also the lives and  motivations of the investigators who set up experiments or surveys to test  their hypotheses, he leaves indelible impressions of his subjects.    Hunt notes that good deeds, like the rescue of three car passengers from the  frigid Potomac in 1982 by Arland Williams Jr., who died during the ordeal, are  less understandable to most of us than those selfish, aggressive or brutal acts  that benefit the actor. We tend to doubt the motives of heroes, suspecting that  underneath it all there must be a lust for praise, for public approval. But  whether or not there is such motivation, we cannot deny that heroic acts occur,  acts in which ""behavior is carried out to benefit another without anticipation  of rewards from external sources.""    Hunt seems to accept the human capacity for evil without dwelling on its  causes. Kohn, who is equally convinced that people are capable of generosity  and kindness, does not seem to accept the explanation that man's inhumanity to  man is part of the package. He attributes the contemporary acceptance of  selfishness and brutality as facts of life to a mistaken general belief in  heredity over environment. He implies that many people believe that our  nastiness is biologically ""hard-wired,"" and that non-negotiable factors such as  excess testosterone in men or right-brainedness lead to aggression and  insensitivity.    While Hunt explores the personal motivations of the researchers whose work he  describes, Kohn focuses on what he sees as the enemy -- sociobiology and  scientific reductionism. Neither author pays much attention to animal models,  but Hunt finds some work with animals worth describing. Rather than excoriate  certain evolutionary biologists, he dismisses the idea that a single gene could  be responsible for such complex human drives as ambition or romantic love. Hunt  does not accuse scientists who use terms like ""the altruistic gene"" of serving  an authoritarian political agenda. Rather he calls the phrase a scientific  ""shorthand: it refers to those built-in neural and visceral reactions to  distress in others that are the substructure of altruistic behavior.""    Both authors build on the work of the late Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget, who  discovered that infants and children develop in specific stages. Piaget's work  implies that at a certain stage, usually about the age of 7, children are able  to put themselves in someone else's shoes, to imagine someone else's pain, and  act to soothe and comfort as they would like to be comforted. Both authors also  refer frequently to the remarkable work of Holocaust survivor Saul Oliner, a  Humboldt State University sociologist. Oliner mapped the motives, explanations  and backgrounds of European Gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews during  World War II. Contrary to expectation, he found that these altruists included  both self-confident and insecure people, the deeply religious as well as  atheists. The single trait these heroes shared was an upbringing free from  corporal punishment where, instead, their parents reasoned with them.    Hunt's approach is rich in anecdote and narrative. He includes a test so the  reader can measure his or her own sensibilities. Kohn tends to emphasize the  psychological and philosophical ramifications of what it takes to have a humane  society.    Besides style, a major difference in the way these authors document altruistic  behavior is the way each suggests change be effected. Hunt seems, almost  naively, to take for granted that most people want their children to be kind  and generous and good. Kohn believes our selfishness is the product of a  society dominated by people committed to competition and individualism. In  fact, Kohn indicts individualism for the widespread appeal of belief systems  that promise transcendence. He suggests that ""our detachment from others has  turned us into hitchhikers, anxious to escape the self in the first vehicle  that comes down the road -- even one that propels us right past humanity.""    Their conclusions reveal their agendas. Hunt sums up: ""Perhaps it is time for  another call to arms. . . . to serve in a Helping Corps or a Samaritan Service  would bring us to our feet cheering, sensing that our inner desire to do good  to our fellow human beings can transform and ennoble us, and that when we ask  not how we can be served but how we can serve, we ourselves are well serviced.""  And Kohn, clearly impressed by the feminist idea of Carol Gilligan that women  speak ""in a different voice,"" declares: ""Very roughly, my intention here is to  contrast an individual morality with a relational one, a cognitive morality  with an affective one, a principle- or rule-based morality with one grounded in  care or empathy.""    Although both authors downplay the evidence of altruism in other social  mammals, those studies, together with the experiments they describe in their  books, add weight to the argument that we are biologically as well as  psychologically primed to act kindly toward one another. These tendencies can  be cultivated by encouraging pro-social behavior in school and cooperative  learning, as well as by example at home. Whatever the power of heredity, these  authors are eager for the pendulum to swing toward the efficacy of a good  environment and they intend, with their books, to give the pendulum a good  push. Would that they are right, that human beings are kinder and more generous  than it sometimes seems and that by cultivating empathy in our children we can  achieve a more peaceable kingdom.

Civil disobedience, particularly in a democracy, is one of the most profound  acts of personal responsibility an individual can undertake. It deserves to be  considered legitimate only if it meets one or more tests:     -- It is addressed to a collective social conscience which, either through  ignorance or denial, has refused to engage the issue at hand.     -- Those who undertake it are otherwise disenfranchised from normal political  participation.     -- Other avenues of orderly, just redress are foreclosed.    Operation Rescue's leaders claim their actions are sanctioned by the great  tradition of civil disobedience that begins with Thoreau and runs through  Gandhi to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. There are, however, profound differences  among the actions of such men and those OperationRescue has urged on its  adherents.    Thoreau, for example, confronted an historical situation in which nativist  bigotry and rabid expansionism had made normative opposition to the Mexican War  impossible. Gandhi was the disenfranchised colonial subject of an exploitative  imperialist power. Dr. King faced a society in which Jim Crow had denied black  people not only political participation but also access to a fair hearing in  the local courts.    Are any of these historical precedents present in the case of Operation Rescue?  The answer, clearly, is no. Operation Rescue's leaders contend that is  irrelevant, since their conduct is justified by what they see as the necessity  to save lives. Judge Tashima wisely rejected that defense, since it resolves  the thorny question of when life begins with an answer accessible only through  faith.    When it comes to the question of abortion, the American conscience has been  engaged, if conflicted, for more than two decades. The issue has been debated  up, down and sideways onevery conceivable occasion and on every imaginable  platform. Everyone who wished to make a moral judgment has had time to form his  conscience.    Opponents of legal abortion can hardly be said to have been disenfranchised.  They have made the question an election issue in constituencies at every level;  people can and have been voted out of office for supporting or opposing a  woman's right to an abortion.    Finally, as the Supreme Court's recent decision in Webster vs. Reproductive  Services demonstrates, opponents of legal abortion have had complete access to  thorough, fair court hearings.    If Operation Rescue is not a legitimate exercise of civil disobedience, what is  it? It is, in fact, a public tantrum by people who seek to win through  intimidation what they cannot achieve through politics or law.

The regime's guards and agents have  arrested a large number of the city's residents, especially  youths, in fear of more riots erupting, and this has further  heightened the Zahedan people's anger at Khomeyni's regime.    The valiant people of Zahedan and the families of the  martyrs  of the latest demonstrations in that city have forced the  Khomeyni regime to hand over the bodies of three of the martyrs  of those demonstrations. The regime's officials -- terrified at  the Zahedan people's reaction at the last rites of the martyrs  of the heroic demonstrations, which would fan their fury and  hatred -- had refrained from handing over the bodies.    In the course of the heroic uprising by the people of  Zahedan, in addition to some being martyred, thirty people were  also wounded. Some of the regime's guards and agents were also  killed by the people.    Following the large-scale demonstrations by the people of  Zahedan and the attack on Hashemi-Rafsanjani, which has plunged  the entire regime in fear, Khamene'i issued a decree appointing  Besharati, a (?member) of the shah's SAVAK and the current  interior minister, as his replacement in the law enforcement  forces for the next three years.

With success from God and with broad popular support in the  governorates of Aden, Lahij, and Abyan and other governorates of  the Republic, and also with the resolve of the sincere men of  our valiant Armed Forces' heroes, great victories were achieved  today. The forces of the al-'Amaliqah Brigade, the 2d Armored  Brigade, and the 8th Special Forces Brigade managed to  accomplish their combat missions successfully.    Today, the al-'Amaliqah forces destroyed the Madram Brigade  and seized all its equipment. The Brigade's chiefs of staff  surrendered, and its commander fled. A large number of officers  and soldiers from the Madram Brigade and the 5th Armored Brigade  joined the forces of the constitutional legitimacy. These  brigades are still waging decisive heroic battles against the  remnants of the secessionist forces of apostasy.    Also today, the forces of the 56th Brigade managed with  great  success to storm the defensive fortifications of the forces of  apostasy and secession. The vanguards of these forces arrived  in the area of Dar Sa'd, close to the Shaykh 'Uthman  neighborhood, one of the outskirts of the governorate of Aden.  They also closed the way to the supplies heading for the camps  of the misled ones who are dominated by the forces of apostasy  and secession in the governorate of Lahij.    Our valiant forces are now continuing to wage a heroic  battle  against the forces of the Salah-al-Din camp, which are being  misled by the rebellious secessionist gang, in order to force  them into surrendering and yielding to both the people's will  and legitimacy. This force is currently in the throes of death  before the courageous heroic blows dealt by the heroes of our  Armed Forces who continue to chase the remaining dens of the  elements of the rebellious secessionist gang.    On the southern axis, our courageous Armed Forces, the  forces  of the constitutional legitimacy, managed to storm and capture  the third fortified defense line of the forces of the al-Buzah  Brigade, and continued their advance to other fortifications.  Today, Monday, 250 personnel of the al-Buzah Brigade  surrendered with their full weapons and equipment, and declared  that they joined the forces of unity and constitutional  legitimacy.    Large quantities of weapons, equipment, and vehicles were  seized, including eight tanks and a number of guns and armored  vehicles. Our forces are currently chasing the fleeing remnants  of the secessionist forces of apostasy in that area.    Also in the governorate of Lahij, the heroes of the 2d  Armored Brigade continued to advance steadily and accomplish  their combat missions successfully in terms of combing the  district of al-Dali' for the remnants of the forces of apostasy  and rebellion. Large numbers from the 'Abbud Brigade in the  district of al-Dali' joined the forces of unity and legitimacy.    During the combing campaigns being carried out along the  collapsing positions of the forces of apostasy and secession,  our forces found huge quantities of Marxist and Leninist books,  through which the YSP was trying to obliterate the national  identity and to distort the thought of the sons of our Yemeni  people, and to psychologically and ideologically indoctrinate  the fighters of the military units that used to be under its  control.    The heroic al-Wahdah infantry, artillery, and armored  brigades, today continued to wage battles of bravery and honor  in defense of unity and legitimacy.    In another development, our valiant Armed Forces' Air Force  today, continued its successful air attacks, during which it has  successfully bombarded the set targets. Our aircraft returned  safely to base.    The antiaircraft defenses today downed an aircraft belonging  to the secessionist gang near the city of Mudiyah in the Abyan  Governorate.    The source hailed the splendid and heroic performance of the  personnel of our valiant Armed Forces and their great triumph  for the will of the people and their option for unity,  democracy, and the defense of their constitutional institutions.    The source also lauded the high national morale, enthusiasm,  and commitment to the national responsibility expressed by the  masses of our Yemeni people against the secessionist gang, and  their support for their sons in the valiant Armed Forces.    It congratulated our people on the great victories over the  secessionist gang, stressing that the victories that have been  achieved over the gang of fragmentation, apostasy, and  secession, are attributed to God's grace, and are the fruit of  the steadfastness of the masses of our Yemeni people, their  support for the forces of Yemeni unity and constitutional  legitimacy, and their confrontation of the plans to dismember  and destroy the homeland.    The source said that the losses among the ranks of our  valiant Armed Forces as a result of the fighting that has been  raging against the forces of apostasy and secession since these  forces ignited the fire of war last Wednesday and until now have  reached 74 martyrs, and 314 wounded, in addition to 17 civilian  martyrs as a result of the treacherous aggression of the forces  of apostasy and secession. There was no immediate count  available of the number of the martyrs and the wounded personnel  of the Central Security, who were betrayed by the forces of  apostasy and secession in Aden, who attacked their camp on the  sad and bloody day of Wednesday.    Up until the time this statement was being prepared, our  valiant Armed Forces, have managed, on all axes of the fighting,  to inflict heavy defeats on the forces of apostasy and  secession, and to seize huge quantities of weapons, equipment,  and serviceable vehicles. Large numbers of the troops who were  misled by the rebelling secessionist gang have also joined the  forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy, renewing their  allegiance to the legitimacy, the constitutional institutions,  and to the one Yemeni homeland, the homeland of freedom,  justice, democracy, progress, and prosperity.    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If you  will aid the cause of God, He will aid you, and plant your feet  firmly. [Koranic verse]     "

The MKO office in Paris issued a statement declaring this  stance, saying: An MKO spokesman vehemently condemned the  explosion at the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon him, in the  holy city of Mashhad and has said that the Khomeyni regime's  linking such a criminal act to the Mojahedin and the Iranian  Resistance is an absolute lie and its objective is merely to  tarnish the image of the just and extensive resistance of the  people of Iran against the religious and terrorist dictatorship  of the clerics.    This spokesman added: The Iranian Resistance would never  resort to such criminal actions which would desecrate the  sanctity of the infallible imams, and would cause such an  extensive loss of life and [word indistinct] among the innocent  people. This filthy and criminal action is only in the interest  of the clerical regime.    On numerous occasions in the past, the regime has planted  bombs and resorted to such acts, including hurling a grenade at  the French Embassy and the Air France office in Tehran,  ascribing these acts to the MKO.    We now draw your attention to the interview by the leader of  the Iranian Resistance, brother mojahed Mas'ud Rajavi, on the  atrocity perpetrated on Monday by the misanthropic clerics in  the hallowed precincts of the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon  him.    Mas'ud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian Resistance, condemned  the heinous atrocity of an explosion in the sacred precincts of  Imam Reza's shrine in Mashhad by the terrorist dictatorship of  the clerics on 'Ashura [tenth day of Moharram] which resulted in  martyring and wounding a large number of innocent pilgrims and  damage to the tomb of Imam Reza, peace be upon him, and he  conveyed his condolences to the people of Iran. He described it  as a profane, antihuman, and anti-Islamic crime on the part of  the ruling tyrannical Yazidi [Yazid was Umayyad Caliph in  Damascus, and considered a heretic] clerics.    The leader of the Iranian Resistance stressed that the  objective of the Khomeyni regime in staging the explosion in the  holy precincts of the Imam Reza shrine, linking it to the MKO,  is nothing but a precursor to a series of terrorist acts in the  future against the Iranian Resistance which in the past have  included the aerial attack on the National Liberation Army  bases, explosions in offices and bases of the Iranian  Resistance, and the assassinations of Resistance activists  abroad.    Some days ago, the Khomeyni regime disseminated consummate  lies, claiming that the MKO had launched an attack on the Ilam  border, western Iran, in which some persons had been killed and  wounded.    Rajavi added: The criminal clerics are entrenched in a deep  political and economic crisis and are unable to combat the  proliferating dissatisfaction and increasing resistance by the  Iranian people. They do not find any recourse but to embark on  such inauspicious and bestial crimes and in the holy precincts  of the Imam Reza shrine at that. This is an unprecedented crime  which no other dictator has resorted to before.    Rajavi stressed: The cruel clerics have--since the heroic  uprising by the people of Mashhad--[words indistinct] continued  to seek revenge and harassed the people of Khorasan Province and  the pilgrims to the shrine of Imam Reza. He continued: The  Khomeyni regime is seeking to justify its next crime and thus to  arouse the religious sentiments of the people and to tarnish the  face of the MKO, who--because of their deep devotion to Islam,  the religion of mercy and liberation--enjoy greater credibility  among the Iranian people. They therefore chose the day of  'Ashura, the site of the holy shrine of Imam Reza, and the  anniversary of 30 Khordad--the day when the MKO uprising against  the regime was initiated--for perpetrating this crime.    The statement issued immediately by Khamene'i, the leader of  the clerical regime, linking this explosion to the MKO, and the  threatening propaganda by the regime, based on vengeance against  the MKO, are part of this previously formulated scenario.    While recalling the setting on fire of the Rex Theater in  Abadan, and the killing of innocent people in the last few  months of the shah's rule, the setting ablaze [as heard] of the  precincts of the Holy Ka'bah by agents of the Khomeyni regime in  1366 [year beginning 21 March 1987] Rajavi emphasized that the  clerical regime--despite its claims to being a protector of  Islam--has gone a step further and has massacred innocent  pilgrims in the Imam Reza shrine, the most hallowed site in all  of Iran. The unprecedented crime is an indication of the  incurable crises in Iran, and the abject impotence of the  clerics before the resistance of the Iranian people.    He added: In addition, the vestiges of the Khomeyni  regime--in view of the lack of participation on the part of the  people in the anniversary ceremonies for Khomeyni--are seeking  to damage the Imam Reza shrine and by violating its sanctity,  they wish to replace it with the temple of idols in which  Khomeyni is interred. Rajavi called on the United Nations,  Islamic Conference Organization, the Islamic governments,  international organizations that are defenders of human rights  to condemn this appalling atrocity and to send a team to Iran to  investigate this crime.    In order to thwart any deceitful actions by the clerical  regime, the Iranian Resistance deems the presence of its  representatives necessary in an international delegation to  investigate this incident. This is the insistent demand of the  people and the Resistance of Iran to the international community  who should not permit the criminal clerics to escape unscathed  after committing such an unprecedented crime.

The just-born People's Army and people of Korea could win  over the world's reactionary Allied forces in the fatherland  liberation war because they fought an all-people heroic  struggle, only believing in the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, a legendary hero of the anti-Japanese struggle and  ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, and closely  rallied behind him, the article says, and goes on:    The Korean people, above all, rose as one in the war of  justice and fought valiantly in hearty response to the militant  call of the party and the leader ""Everything for victory in the  war!""    It was their unfailing loyalty to the party and the leader  and high patriotic zeal that made the Korean people rise as one  for victory in the fatherland liberation war when a grave danger  befell their country and nation due to the imperialist  aggression.    The entire people took arms instead of hammer and sickle,  pen  and book and enthusiastically volunteered to the front with a  resolve to fight it out to the last drop of their blood.    The officers and men of the People's Army defended every  inch  of the fatherland at the cost of their blood by displaying  matchless mass heroism, upholding orders of the respected leader  with their whole heart.    Many heroic soldiers including hero Yi Su-pok ensured  victories in fierce battle with the enemy by dedicating  themselves to silence the enemy's pillboxes and destroying tanks  and warships.    All the people in the rear, workers, peasants, students, the  old and the young, fought heroically for wartime production and  aided the front, not yielding at all even under the barbarous  bombings by the enemy, and creditably ensured victory in the  war, overcoming all hardships and difficulties, united firmly as  one.    In particular, in the enemy-held areas, people organized  guerrillas, young people formed young guards, and children  children's guards to fight against the U.S. imperialist  aggressors.    The Korean people and People's Army could so fully display  mass heroism and the spirit of patriotic devotion in the  fatherland liberation war because they firmly believed that they  would always emerge victorious when they fought as indicated by  the leader, cherishing deep down in their hearts the justice of  the line, strategy and tactics laid down by the great leader  Comrade Kim Il- song and the wiseness of his leadership.    The enormous significance of the fatherland liberation war  lies in that it strikingly demonstrated the fact that the  strength of a people united firmly behind their party and leader  is inexhaustible and nothing can break it.    Now, the Korean people and People's Army are firmly united  behind respected supreme commander General Kim Chong-il, an  ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, ideologically  and purposefully and In-moral obligation.    They will as ever firmly unite behind the party and the  leader and wage an all-people heroic struggle, thus smashing  whatever maneuvers of the imperialists and firmly defending and  further glorifying the Korean-style socialism.

The Islamic Jihad Movement's statement  called 'Arafat's reaction another example of capitulation to the  Zionist will and dictates. The statement regretted that the new  authority should have reacted the way it did against an  operation carried out by the Jihad Movement, when it cannot bar  armed settlers from the self-rule areas. We reject this skewed  logic, as do our people, who yesterday were jubilant over the  heroic operation.    Our jihad will continue and we will keep our weapons as long  as the occupation remains, the Jihad Movement's statement  emphasized.    Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has  issued  a statement to mark the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Adha. As  we celebrate the 'Id, advocates of negotiation and lovers of  normalization with the Zionist entity try to convince us that  the 27,000 sq. km that is Palestine has now shrunk to 400 sq.  km, where they plan to set up an authority to provide for the  security of the Zionist settlers and guard the interests of the  shabby leadership.    The Hamas statement called for remembering the martyrs,  detainees, and wounded, who put their lives on the line for the  sake of the homeland. The statement also appealed for help to  be extended to the poor among our people, whose ranks have been  swollen by the Zionist closure of the occupied territories.     "

Where can their RAF lovers, Ferrando and Guglielmo, be? Then they hear that the boyfriends are being sent straight into action today. Meeting in a quick but tearful farewell ('. . . life's a bitch and then you die'), the girls beg the men 'You must be sure to 'phone'. But soon two rich American strangers (F. and G. in disguise) enter the girls' lives, announcing 'We're hung like two sun-ripe bananas' . . . Music Theatre London has its own style, and has had notable success in Mozart's Figaro and Don Giovanni and Rossini's Cinderella. The performers are actors who can also sing; recitatives are spoken; and everything is transposed into present-day England. This method has made us see the societies of old operas by a newly sharp light, while laughing at the England we know. Now MTL is tackling Cos fan tutte. Despina is a neighbour who pops in to borrow some sugar, and Dorabella stuffs herself neurotically with chocolate biscuits as her first aria ends. Cos, however, faces MTL with a new kind of problem, because it is less to do with sociological structure than Figaro, Giovanni and Cinderella. Class tensions are virtually absent from Cos, whose subject - women's capacity for infidelity, and men's reactions to that - is developed in private. Another problem is that the usual MTL director, Nick Broadhurst, was unable to shape the entire show; William Relton is billed as 'co-director', and this Cos only fitfully displays the impish, revelatory modern detail that kept bubbling up through the company's previous work. Yet, although this staging is not always neat or satisfying, it addresses the core of Cos seriously - and so proves often stimulating, often entertaining. Its strengths and weaknesses of this Cos are best illustrated by its Ferrando, Simon Butteriss (an MTL regular). Ferrando, Cos's least defined character, is appalled when he finds that Dorabella has betrayed him  -yet, trying to seduce Fiordiligi only minutes later, he becomes (musically) so impassioned that we wonder if he has transferred affection. In this case, we don't wonder any more - we know. Butteriss keeps forcing us to attend to the workings of Ferrando's heart when Mozart leaves us (and Ferrando) ambiguous. This helps us to re-think Ferrando, but not always to believe simply that he is Ferrando. No-one onstage is more vividly alive to every nuance, more exemplary in dramatic commitment, but he actually works too hard. To cope with the role's rigorous lines, he has acquired newly lyrical and heroic vocal tones - enlarging his usually incisive, but strenuous and tight, vocal method. These new 'Ferrando' tones, however, are not unified; you can hear him changing tack vocally. Fiordiligi (Jacinta Mulcahy), Dorabella (Mary Lincoln), and Guglielmo (Peter Corry) - all vocally more relaxed - give sensitive, accomplished performances that are intermittently exciting. Fiordiligi gets visibly high on the defiant proclamations of fidelity in her first aria; and Dorabella's giggly second aria (here sung in a drunken lather) exposes her own unresisting emotional helplessness. Both girls are brunette beauties. But, despite several such illuminating passages, they lack force of character, so that sometimes we feel what certain opponents of Cos have claimed: that these people are fools. The two most completely conceived characters are Alfonso (Richard Hampton) and Despina (Marilyn Cutts).

It might have come off even better had the Bavarians not been tempted to build what is essentially a medium-sized regional service point on such an heroic scale. The place has clearly been built with long-term growth (and the prosperity of the German metal-working industry) in mind. However, disproportionate walking distances are partly compensated for by an unclaustrophobic atmosphere and a liberal sprinkling of cafes and restaurants. A full range of services is amply staffed by people with a tendency to brisk efficiency, further contributing to a more relaxed feel than is common in such places. The principal drawback is the airport's position well away from the city, which makes travelling to and fro something of a trial. It can be costly, too, for those who elect to avoid the cheap 45-minute S-Bahn train ride across the dead-flat Bavarian heathlands to the city centre. High spot of the journey is the airport visitors' viewing point: a perfect cone of spoil from the airport construction work. The S-Bahn journey is comfortable enough, but over-punctuated with stops at every hamlet along the way. The taxi ride, officially 30 minutes, but often longer because of the Germans' love of traffic jams, costs a whacking DM90. Experienced hands on one-day trips prefer to hire a small car for up to DM60, but this is not especially advised for occasional visitors unfamiliar with Munich's whirligig traffic guidance systems.

A responsible security source said the ministry issued a  statement last Saturday on the arrest of a leading group that  had assisted terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, including Lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani, a dangerous terrorist who played a major  role in recent terrorist incidents and who was arrested on 3  July 1990. He and others were also charged in Case No. 7 of  1990 in Markaz Isna for attacking citizens and preventing them  from visiting cemeteries.    The source said that the statement also indicated that  Lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani was also charged in Case No. 4116 of 1991,  the jurisdiction of Markaz Isna, when he was caught while  distributing leaflets inciting extremist thought and instigating  acts of violence.    The security source said in his statement that the Interior  Ministry's statement of last Saturday contained a warning about  moves by some self-interested people who try in one way or  another to support terrorism by using some confrontations to  assume false heroic poses.    He added that in its statement the Ministry stressed its  intention to confront these elements firmly and decisively  should they contemplate any attempts to violate legitimacy and  the law under this cover while only aiming to create confusion  among the people.    The source added that this morning some elements known for  their activities in connection with these groups and some  members of the dissolved and banned Muslim Brotherhood incited  some lawyers and misled members of the Bar Association to  assemble at the Bar Association headquarters. There they urged  the lawyers to stage a mass demonstration to rouse the public,  incite them to violate the law, and subject the public to the  danger of infiltration by elements who pursue only sedition and  deception.    Responsible Interior Ministry security sources said the  security forces have emphatically advised these groups  repeatedly not to stage any demonstrations from the Bar  Association headquarters out of concern for the citizens' lives  and security. But, he added, it was evident that there was a  purposeful intention by this renegade minority to carry out  sedition and incitement.    He said this intention was manifested when those who  gathered  inside the Bar Association building threw bricks and stones down  onto the police and passers by and then rushed into the street  in a vociferous demonstration chanting hostile slogans.    The source added that the security forces deployed in the  area intervened immediately to break up the demonstration and  arrested 39 of the leaders. It transpired that there were 27  lawyers among them; the rest were not members of the Bar  Association.    He said that lawyer Mursi Muhammad 'Abd-al-Qadir and  (?teacher) Khalid 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ibrahim al-Jiddawi suffered  slight injuries for which they were hospitalized but no damage  was caused in the area because the security forces took control  of the situation.    The Interior Ministry responsible security source revealed  that the Ministry authorities had received information that some  extremist members of the Bar Association had called on their  colleagues to carry arms to confront the security forces.    He said the Ministry authorities at dawn today compiled a  report on this information, numbered 2293-Qasr al-Nil, and sent  it to the competent prosecution office.    The security source said that the Interior Ministry has been  patient with all the incitement incidents since the death of  terrorist 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, despite the extremely sensitive  security circumstances at this time.    He explained that the Ministry did this to show the  inevitability of democracy, which has been emphasized by the  political leadership; but the attempts by a hireling minority of  Bar Association members prompted the security forces to  decisively confront this morning's attempts to endanger the  Egyptian public's lives and property.    The Interior Ministry will issue a comprehensive statement  containing updated information and details on the issue at a  later time.     "

One of the themes of that play was the absence of Causes for young men to write, fight and die for. This made them very angry. The fascists had been seen off, and the Vietnam war hadn't started. There was no great campaign in which a young man could sublimate his more aggressive sexual energies, with the result that Osborne's angry young man became verbally, if not physically, brutal to his adoring girlfriend. When one considers the great increase in reported crime of sexual assault, particularly among young married couples, it is clear that Mr Osborne has not lost his sense of timing and perception; and it is a pity that he is finding it such a struggle to persuade an actor to take the leading role in his new play. Both on the left and on the right, the great causes to die for appear to have collapsed. The death of totalitarianism in eastern Europe has left a great void in our consciences. While it is unfortunately the case that the people of eastern Europe are still damp, poor and unhappy, they are damp, poor and unhappy about material things, such as housing and food, and this is strangely unsympathetic. Now that they can vote for whom they want to keep them damp, poor and unhappy, they are no more heroic than a Liverpool couple who have been kept waiting rather too long for a bigger council flat. The left, too, has suffered a terrible loss of moral direction. Its political anger has always been aimed at the United States. I have never understood the deep loathing that many intellectuals have for America and all its works, but it is an undoubted phenomenon and one which acts as a bond throughout the wine-bars of Europe. In the 1980s, Nicaragua was the great focus for this visceral anger but the poor dears have not yet recovered from the unfortunately democratic demolition of the Sandinistas and have suffered even more anguish as the former Sandinista leaders have turned their great minds to exploiting capitalism rather than opposing it: one has even made a great success of running a private airline. If Graham Greene had not been so old, one might have speculated that he died of a broken heart. And, alas, the Americans' campaign to oust Iraq from Kuwait has not lived up to expectations. They have resolutely refused to install a puppet regime either in Kuwait or in Iraq, as if they had never read any articles by John Pilger. And now, unforgiveably, the Americans are trying to help the Kurds. Where is the Machiavellianism in that? Where is the conspiracy? The Kurds control no oil; they are a destabilising force in Turkey, America's great hope for the eastern defence of Nato; they have no large American diaspora to be reckoned with in the future Presidential election. How can a young man grow into adulthood and maturity if he is being denied the right to despise American cynicism and moral corruption? The worst of it is that the Kurds would have been a perfect Cause - powerless, pointless and primitive. They would have been the best hope of those who wish to work out their own adolescent self-loathing on a people who are pathetically grateful for any kind of support at all. But even that Cause has been appropriated by the grown-ups. The young have every right to be angry. Go to it, Mr Osborne. Dominic Lawson is the editor of the Spectator.

Where can their RAF lovers, Ferrando and Guglielmo, be? Then they hear that the boyfriends are being sent straight into action today. (Chorus: 'Onward and upwards to victory]') Meeting in a quick but tearful farewell ('. . . life's a bitch and then you die'), the girls beg the men 'You must be sure to 'phone'. But soon two rich American strangers (F. and G. in disguise) enter the girls' lives, announcing 'We're hung like two sun-ripe bananas' . . . Music Theatre London has its own style, which in recent years has had notable success in Mozart's Figaro and Don Giovanni and Rossini's Cinderella. The performers are actors who can also sing; recitatives are spoken; and everything - locale and words - is transposed into present-day England. This method has made us see the societies of old operas by a newly sharp light, while laughing at the England we know. Now MTL is tackling Cos fan tutte. Despina is a neighbour who pops in to borrow some sugar, and Dorabella stuffs herself neurotically with chocolate biscuits as her first aria ends. Cos, however, faces MTL with a new kind of problem, because it is less to do with sociological structure than Figaro, Giovanni and Cinderella. Class tensions are virtually absent from Cos, whose subject - women's capacity for infidelity, and men's reactions to that - is developed in private. Another problem here is the fact that the usual MTL director, Nick Broadhurst, was unable to shape the entire show; William Relton is billed as 'co-director'. In consequence, this Cos only fitfully displays the impish, revelatory modern detail that kept bubbling up through the company's previous work. Yet, although this staging is not always neat or satisfying, it addresses the core of Cos seriously - and so proves often stimulating, often entertaining. Its strengths and weaknesses of this Cos are best illustrated by its Ferrando, Simon Butteriss (an MTL regular). Ferrando, Cos's least defined character, is appalled when he finds that Dorabella has betrayed him  -yet, trying to seduce Fiordiligi only minutes later, he becomes (musically) so impassioned that we wonder if he has transferred affection. In this case, we don't wonder any more - we know. Butteriss keeps forcing us to attend to the workings of Ferrando's heart when Mozart leaves us (and Ferrando) ambiguous. This helps us to re-think Ferrando, but not always to believe simply that he is Ferrando. No-one onstage is more vividly alive to every nuance, more exemplary in dramatic commitment, but he actually works too hard. To cope with the role's rigorous lines, he has, you can hear, acquired newly lyrical and heroic vocal tones - enlarging his usually incisive, but strenuous and tight, vocal method. (He has already this year played Mozart's Marcellina, Masetto and Basilio - quite a gamut.) These new 'Ferrando' tones, however, are not unified; you can hear him changing tack vocally. Fiordiligi (Jacinta Mulcahy), Dorabella (Mary Lincoln), and Guglielmo (Peter Corry) - all vocally more relaxed - give sensitive, accomplished performances that are intermittently exciting. Fiordiligi gets visibly high on the defiant proclamations of fidelity in her first aria; and Dorabella's giggly second aria (here sung in a drunken lather) exposes her own unresisting emotional helplessness. Both girls are brunette beauties. But, despite several such illuminating passages, they lack force of character, so that sometimes we feel what certain opponents of Cos have claimed: that these people are fools. The two most completely conceived characters are Alfonso (Richard Hampton) and Despina (Marilyn Cutts). Hampton's delivery, however, is laborious and grey, whereas the tension whooshes up with Cutts's every entrance. She sings and acts this nosy, knowing neighbour with easy assurance. Tony Britten, leading the band of five, gives the show the right brisk pulse. The ensembles, as they should, danced.

NODONG SINMUN in an editorial titled ""Invincible Is the  Korean People's Army Advancing Under the Party's Leadership""  says:    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded the Korean  People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) on April 25, 1932, 62 years  ago. It was a historic event which gave birth to the  revolutionary Armed Forces of the Workers' Party of Korea, true  revolutionary Armed Forces of chuche type. The founding of the  KPRA meant the brilliant realisation of the ages-long desire of  the Korean people to have their own strong army and the  beginning of the proud history of the heroic Korean People's  Army (KPA).    Our revolutionary Armed Forces which were founded and have  covered a glorious course of victory under the guidance of the  respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song are now on a new, higher  stage of development with general Kim Chong-il, a great  iron-willed brilliant commander, as their supreme commander.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said:    ""Comrade Kim Chong-il has an indomitable will and grit,  outstanding wisdom and commanding art as befits the supreme  commander of the revolutionary Armed Forces. This guarantees a  constant strengthening and development of our revolutionary  Armed Forces and their invincibility.""    The immortal exploits performed by our Supreme Commander  General Kim Chong-il in the cause of building our revolutionary  Armed Forces are, first of all, that he propounded the most  correct and unique military idea and theory, clearly indicating  the road ahead of our People's Army.    His military idea and theory cover all theoretical and  practical matters arising in the building of revolutionary Armed  Forces in our time, ranging from the mission of the Army of the  working class to the principle and way of Army building and the  unreserved demonstration of the Armed Forces. With this  chuche-oriented military idea and theory, our revolutionary  Armed Forces will firmly maintain their revolutionary character  as the Army of the leader, the party and the people and reliably  defend our cause of socialism without the slightest vacillation  under whatever conditions.    His exploits are also that he strengthened our revolutionary  Armed Forces with his outstanding and tested leadership into a  matchless Army firmly prepared politically and ideologically and  in military technique.    The entire officers and men of the People's Army are  upholding the leadership of the respected comrade supreme  commander and performing heroic feats and working miracles in  military service with the revolutionary will to defend him with  their lives as rifles and bombs.    Our People's Army is displaying its proud looks as  invincible  revolutionary Armed Forces with powerful means of attack and  defence and unique tactics of chuche.    His exploits are also that he consolidated the ideological  unity between the Army and the people through a thorough  application of the idea of Army-people unity.    The officers and men of our People's Army always love the  people and devote everything for their interests. Our people  actively support and encourage the People's Army both materially  and morally.    Thanks to the singlehearted unity of the Army and the people  around the respected comrade supreme commander, we can defeat  any formidable enemy.    The leadership of comrade supreme commander is the life and  soul of the People's Army and a decisive factor for victory in  army building and military activities.    The entire people and the KPA officers and men must uphold  the leadership of the respected supreme commander General Kim  Chong-il with loyalty and filial piety with the conviction that  they will certainly win because he is leading them, and defend  the party and the leader with their lives in singlehearted unity.    An editorial of MINJU CHOSON stresses that the KPA and the  Korean people will as ever demonstrate its ever-victorious might  under the leadership of the great General Kim Chong-il.     "

0,FT921-5984 ,"FT921-5984 _AN-CCAAAADZFT 920229   FT  29 FEB 92 / Books: When 'Matador' missed the bus      By ANTHONY VERRIER   MALAYA 1941: THE FALL OF A FIGHTING EMPIRE by Andrew Gilchrist Robert Hale Pounds 15.95, 185 pages JUST 50 years ago this month the British imperial garrison at Singapore surrendered to Japanese forces, after a mere two months during which Malaya had been invaded and Churchill's 'fortress' besieged. Although these tragic events may pale by comparison with 'the day of infamy' at Pearl Harbour on December 7 1941, they should, after half a century, be remembered and studied by anyone who wishes to know why the British Empire of the East utterly collapsed. The consequences of that collapse (and somewhat illusory post-war recovery) are with us today. Sir Andrew Gilchrist was an experienced eye-witness of Japan's preparations for war. He was in Singapore as Nemesis approached. He is a careful student of the British Government's hapless search for appeasement or deterrent. Now he has written an account of the all but insoluble strategic problems, confusion at the command level and, above all, collapse of morale - indeed, often sheer absence of it - which is to be commended for lucidity and for that rare ability to see events as they overwhelmed participants at the time, not as they appear by the light of retrospective wisdom. The fundamental causes of British defeat at the hands of a race which even quite enlightened Englishmen regarded as inferior - and certainly unable to handle ships and aircraft with the skill of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force - were not only the absence of strategic resources in the Far East but a lack of will to fight intelligently, boldly, or stubbornly with those which were available or had been sent reluctantly, and belatedly, by the War Cabinet in mid-October 1941. By this date two stark factors could no longer be ignored in London: Japan was bent on war; Roosevelt would not keep 'that Japanese dog quiet' - as Churchill had asked him to do in May 1940 - and would certainly not help defend British Asiatic interests until the balloon actually went up. Impaled on the horns of these dilemmas, the British commanders - of whom the most senior, air vice marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham was an elderly dugout, intelligent but indecisive - advocated a pre-emptive operation (MATADOR) into Thailand at one moment, rescinded it the next, then finally abandoned it but then concocted a provisional warning order for moving forces to the Thai border on December 6. That day Japanese forces were sighted at sea, clearly bent on invasion. MATADOR had missed the bus; immediate defeat was followed by collapse, redeemed by much gallantry, sometimes by the least experienced troops, but leading to an inevitable, humiliating fate. Sir Andrew describes this melancholy affair in language which evokes Somerset Maugham: Britain's Asiatic empire was not much to be proud of, and when the yellow peril finally struck, headlong flight (for 'Whites only') became a dominating emotion. Such cruel revelation of imperial decay was however redeemed not only by those who fought on, but by two acts which deserve a salute today: Prince of Wales and Repulse, sailing to their inevitable doom thanks to lack of air cover, and Sir Shenton Thomas, governor of the Straits Settlements. He, with his wife, stayed at his post to endure with those who didn't get away 'four years of miserable captivity'. Sir Andrew cannot match Arthur Marder's Homeric narrative of the last voyage and heroic death of Prince of Wales and Repulse, but he does remind any reader with sensibility and imagination that, futile and horrible although war always is, courage survives to sustain even forlorn hopes.

He was received by the brother commander of the camp and  the officers.    During his visit, the brother president saw the progress of  training and qualification programs at the camp and inspected  the situation of the troops and NCO's. The troops expressed  their happiness over the visit of the brother commander  president, asserting their willingness to make sacrifices for  the sake of the homeland and duty under all circumstances in  defense of the will of the people to maintain unity and bolster  their march and promote progress under democracy, which they  chose as a way of life. They noted that there is nothing more  precious than the homeland and its unity and that nothing  deserves more precious sacrifices than maintaining unity.    The brother leader president spoke to the brother officers,  NCO's, and soldiers, praising the enthusiasm, high morale,  sincere national feelings, and overwhelming feelings of love for  the homeland and loyalty to it, which are demonstrated by the  brother members of the camp and all other sons of our Armed  Forces.    He said this high national and moral spirit on the part of  each individual in our valiant Armed Forces is a true embodiment  of our just cause and of the noble principles and goals in which  the sons of our Armed Forces believe and to which they are  faithful. He noted that they do not fear death and do not  neglect their duty under all circumstances. It was by this  courageous national spirit that the heroes of our Armed Forces  have championed the will of their people and foiled all schemes  and plots against the homeland and its unity. They are today  valiantly opposing the gang of apostasy and secession and  defeating it all over Yemen. They are thus recording a new  chapter of glory, heroism, and sacrifice for our people and our  Armed Forces, which have always been faithful to the people and  the homeland and have represented a bulwark that wards off all  dangers and challenges.    The brother president noted the challenges imposed by the  traitorous agents on the homeland and the seditions and sabotage  they sought to ignite. He said the history of that criminal  gang is replete with destruction and sabotage and that its  conduct is marked by treason and plotting. Without this, this  gang cannot live or have any existence. Our people have  received nothing from this gang save death and destruction.    He added that the collusion, treason, and spite of this gang  against the people and homeland have been exposed. This gang  has a black history of oppression, suppression, and massacres by  suppressing the people's freedoms and displacing qualified  personnel of the sons of the homeland. Our people are today  rising against this clique and are opposing its spite and  trickery to maintain their unity, freedom, and democracy. They  also seek to build their new society on the basis of justice,  comprehensive development, and advanced local government that is  founded on administrative and financial decentralization,  respect for human rights, dignity, and property.    The brother leader president added that the heroic and  great role which our Armed Force are playing in defending unity  and constitutional legitimacy and in confronting those who have  departed from that unity, legitimacy, and the free will our  people demonstrated during the elections of the 27 April 1993,  express our people's strong belief in and determination to  safeguard the achievements and gains they made, thanks to their  struggle, sacrifices, and efforts throughout the course of the  Yemeni revolutions on 26 September and 14 October.    The brother president referred to the current criminal acts  the rebel secessionist gang is committing against the people and  homeland by targeting economic installations and civilian  establishments and continuing its hostile, destructive policy,  including firing Scud missiles against peaceful civilians,  attacking the Aden refinery pipeline and the power generating  station, and destroying electricity and water projects in the  Lahij and Abyan governorates, the latest of which was the  treacherous aggression against civilians and the power  generating station in the airport.    This gang is also cracking down on and torturing innocent  citizens in the brave city of Aden, where the supporters of that  gang are forcing children, the elderly, and women to carry arms,  plunging them into the furnace of death without fear of God and  undeterred by conscience, ethics, or humanism. He also stressed  that this criminal gang will not escape justice because it has  committed acts of crime against the people and homeland,  referring to the many opportunities the leadership has offered  to those who were misled to join the ranks of unity and  legitimacy and not to obey orders issued to them by that gang.    He then explained that those who were misled could still  benefit from the general amnesty law and join the ranks of unity  and legitimacy in order to end the shedding of Yemeni blood.  Therefore, he said, they should take advantage of that before  it is too late and before they regret what they have done  against their people and homeland, stressing that our people and  the Armed Forces, which have managed to overcome many challenges  and backed the will of revolution, liberation, and independence,  will not relinquish unity and will face that new challenge that  is imposed on the homeland's unity and future. Victory will  come, God willing, for our faithful, patient, and militant  people and for the brave Armed Forces.    In his speech, the brother president praised the large-scale  national rallying by the masses of our people, chief among which  are political parties and groups, popular and professional  organizations, and all political and social forces, which have  faced up to their national responsibility and which have  demonstrated a patriotic stand.    He also said that the challenge imposed by the gang of  apostasy and secession on the homeland and its unity represents  a real test to responsible positions and the principled  commitment to the national constants. The brother president  praised the great role Yemeni women played in supporting the  defense of unity and legitimacy. He said that the generous  donations, including food and money, which were offered by every  mother and sister in the Yemeni family, represented a strong  moral support for the heroes of our brave Armed Forces, which  are waging the military operations against the rebels who have  abandoned legitimacy. He also hailed our people's genuineness,  their love for their homeland, and their adherence to unity as a  great goal that cannot be relinquished, adding and that the  homeland and its unity are worthy of all sacrifices.

The General  Committee reviewed developments on the local scene in light of  the regrettable incidents witnessed at the 'Imran camp yesterday.    The General Committee issued the following statement:    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. There  is the type of man whose speech about this world's life may  dazzle thee. And he calls Allah to witness about what is in his  heart; yet he is the most contentious of enemies. [Koranic  verse]    O masses of our great Yemeni people: The GPC has observed,  with extreme concern, the developments of the regrettable  criminal incident witnessed by the city of 'Imran on Wednesday.  At 1200 that day, a group of the 3d Armored Brigade, acting at  the behest of the separatists within the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP], carried out a treacherous, cowardly act against the  members of the 1st Armored Brigade and innocent citizens in the  city of 'Imran. They used tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy  artillery, firing shells at the personnel of the 1st Armored  Brigade, when the personnel were having lunch peacefully at the  dining hall where the members of the joint military committee  were present. The joint military committee was on a visit to  the camp as part of its efforts to check military developments  and pave the way for implementing the military part of the  accord document.    Consequently, many members of the 1st Brigade were martyred  and injured. The military situation inside the camp also flared  up. The comrades-in-arms inside the camp had previously stayed  together peacefully for over four years enjoying a spirit of  amity and camaraderie. However, the influential separatists did  not like this, so they sought to sow discord and ignite fighting  between the sons of the Yemeni Armed Forces, using the commander  of the 3d Armored Brigade and his accomplice in the crime and  sabotage, who is called Yahya Dahish 'Alyan. Both were used as  pliable, criminal tools to ignite fighting between the members  of the two brigades, causing the loss of dozens of innocent  martyrs of troops and citizens in the valiant city of 'Imran.  The shells of the 3d Armored Brigade did not spare the homes of  those citizens, thus claiming the lives of dozens of innocent  martyrs and victims as a result of this treacherous, cowardly  act. In addition, many homes and public facilities in the  valiant city of 'Imran were destroyed.    The General Committee of the GPC condemns and deplores this  heinous crime, which was carried out by certain YSP leaders and  which happened at a time when national and political peaceful  efforts are being dedicated to the implementation of the accord  document, signed in Amman on 20 February, 1994. The crime also  took place at a time when efforts were being exerted to bring  the state institutions closer to a peaceful and positive  relaxation of the crisis, which was engineered by the advocates  of separation who rebelled against democracy, unity, peace, and  peaceful coexistence. This stand is being repeated with every  step made toward a relaxation of the crisis and containment of  its developments and the beginning of the implementation of the  accord document. It began in Abyan when the situation flared up  against the forces of al-'Amaliqah, Shabwah and Harth Sufyan, in  addition to the reckless acts carried out by the camp of the  Ba-Fahd Brigade, terrorizing defenseless citizens in the city of  Dhamar. This situation is being repeated today in the city of  'Imran through the forces of the 3d Armored Brigade, which  caused the martyrdom of dozens of victims.    While expressing its regret, warm sympathies, and  consolation for all the families of the innocent victims who  fell in the premeditated criminal incident -- all of them being  sons of the one Yemeni homeland and whose chaste blood and  precious lives are dear to all of us -- the General Committee  appeals to the heroic troops, noncommissioned officers, and  officers of our valiant Armed Forces to rise to the level of  their national responsibility and match the expectations of  their people as protectors of the homeland and a shield of its  unity and democratic approach. It also appeals to them to be  vigilant so as to avert all schemes that target the homeland,  its unity, security, and stability. They should not heed the  orders issued by the influential separatists within the YSP who  seek to throw them into an inferno of death and fighting with  their brothers and comrades-in-arms, who stand with them in one  trench defending the homeland, the revolution, the republic, and  unity. Those influential separatists want to satisfy their sick  whims and narrow personal interests, having been blinded by the  glitter of [word indistinct] money paid by the enemies of the  Yemeni homeland to ignite fighting between the sons of the  Yemeni people, divide the homeland, and harm its unity and  democracy.    The General Committee also appeals to all parties, factions,  and mass organizations and unions to condemn such criminal  stupidity, reject calls for separation and division, and close  ranks to unify the sincere national will so as to implement the  accord document by showing collective responsibility. This will  spare the homeland the danger of falling into the trap of this  conspiracy that targets the will of the people, their unity,  security and stability.    The General Committee stresses dialogue as a means to  resolve  all differences. It also asserts that the accord document  should be translated into reality, without hesitation or  procrastination, since this document is the common denominator  between all parties, in order to build a modern Yemeni state.    The General Committee urges the masses of our people to  demonstrate more vigilance and alertness and reject and denounce  this conspiracy that aims at dragging the country toward more  fighting, fragmentation, and sedition. It also reiterates the  appeal made by Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the  chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of  the GPC, to the constitutional, legitimate institution -- the  House of Representatives -- to assume all its legal and  constitutional responsibilities to put an end to these stupid,  criminal acts that threaten the safety, security, and stability  of the homeland and citizens. This will safeguard and protect  unity, enhance and protect constitutional legitimacy, and  protect the citizens and the homeland from the intrigues of  enemies and conspirators.    Glory and immortality to the martyrs of unity; death to  plotters against unity. Allah will certainly aid those who aid  His cause; for verily Allah is full of strength, exalted in  might, able to enforce His will.

A portrait of the great leader President Kim Il-song was  placed on the platform of the meeting hall.    The meeting was attended by KPA Marshal O Chin-u, Presidium  member of the Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee],  the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK], first vice-chairman of the  National Defence Commission of the DPRK, member of the party  Central Military Commission and minister of People's Armed  Forces; Vice-President Pak Song-chol who is Politburo member of  the C.C., the WPK; and other senior party and government  officials and officers and men of the Korean People's Army and  working people in the city.    Members of delegations and visiting groups of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] staying in  the socialist homeland were also present.    Military attaches of foreign embassies here were invited to  the meeting.    Vice Marshal of the KPA Kim Kwang-chin, member of the  National Defence Commission of the DPRK, made a report at the  meeting.    The reporter recalled that the cause of building  revolutionary Armed Forces in Korea was started [by] the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song and has been promoted constantly  under the leadership of the party and the leader along with the  victorious advance of the revolutionary cause of chuche.    When he was hewing the path of the Korean revolution,  Comrade  Kim Il-song deeply analysed the historical lessons of the  anti-Japanese national-liberation movement of Korea and put  forward the policy of organising an armed struggle against  Japanese imperialism and building a genuine revolutionary Armed  Forces to that end.    Basing himself on the solid political and military  foundation  he had laid through his energetic efforts to carry out the  policy, he founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army on  April 25, 1932 and proclaimed the founding of the revolutionary  Armed Forces of Korea to the world.    The reporter pointed out that over the past 60 odd years,  the  revolutionary Armed Forces of Korea have traversed a proud  course of victory through a rigorous and arduous struggle and  performed immortal feats which will shine long in the history of  the country by their heroic struggle.    The reporter quoted Comrade Kim Chong-il, respected supreme  commander, as saying:    ""Our People's Army has waged a heroic struggle to safeguard  the party and the leader and defend the motherland and gains of  revolution and performed great exploits for the party and the  revolution.""    Comrade Kim Il-song strengthened the Korean People's  Revolutionary Army into the regular Korean People's Army in a  short period after the liberation of the country, drawing on the  noble traditions of building revolutionary Armed Forces which  had been established during the anti-Japanese revolutionary  struggle.    The invincible might of the KPA was fully demonstrated in  the  fatherland liberation war.    In the great fatherland liberation war, the KPA officers and  men inflicted a disgraceful defeat on the U.S. imperialist  aggressors, who had boasted of being the ""mightiest"" in the  world, and honorably defended the independence of the country  and the sovereignty of the nation, giving full play to mass  heroism and unexcelled self-sacrificing spirit.    The reporter noted that the KPA has entered a new historical  period in its development under the outstanding and tested  leadership of Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il and that a  radical progress has taken place in all spheres of Army building.    The entire ranks of the KPA are filled with the  death-defying  resolution to remain loyal with a single heart to the party's  leadership in whatever storm and stress and become a fortress  and shield to defend the respected comrade supreme commander.    Under his leadership, the KPA has grown to be a unit of  loyal  combatants ready to dedicate their lives for the party and the  leader and a strong Army equipped with powerful means of both  attack and defence, each man of which is a match for a hundred  foes.    Along with the KPA, the combat capabilities of the  worker-peasant red guards and the young red guards have been  strengthened considerably, all people are armed and the whole  country has been consolidated as an impregnable fortress.    We can say confidently that as long as we have the  invincible  revolutionary Armed Forces and the all-people defence system  with the KPA as the core, we can destroy any aggressors and  firmly defend the cause of the party, the cause of socialism.    The noble achievements and imperishable exploits of our  revolutionary Armed Forces are a brilliant victory of the  chuche-based military idea of Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade  Kim Chong-il and results of the outstanding and tested guidance  of the party and the leader.    Referring to the grave situation created on the Korean  peninsula by the reckless military threats and war moves of the  U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique, the  reporter declared:    We will never look at it with folded arms.    Although the U.S. imperialists and the international  reactionaries are desperately trying to isolate and stifle the  DPRK and destroy Korean socialism over the ""nuclear issue,"" no  amount of pressure and threat can frighten our people and no  strong arm and attempt to stifle the DPRK can work on us.    Our people are a people of decision who do not like an empty  talk but mean what they say.    It is our unshakable position to answer dialogue with  dialogue, and war with war.    Our people who cherish the independence of the nation and  peace of the country do not want a war but will not beg for  peace while leaving their dignity violated.    If the U.S. imperialists and their followers unleash a war  in  Korea, going against the trend of the times, our people and  People's Army will fight it out for the party and the leader and  for our socialist motherland which has been defended at the cost  of blood, wipe out the aggressors to the last man and  demonstrate the stamina of heroic Korea once again.

To avenge the continuing Zionist crimes in Palestine; in  reply to the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre; to vindicate the  souls of our people's martyrs; to confirm that direct clashes  with enemy troops are the way to defeat the occupation troops  and the Zionist expansionist scheme; because the heroic  mujahidin and revolutionaries believe armed struggle is the only  possible way to liberate Palestine and other occupied Arab  territories and defeat the liquidatory plan promoted by the  Tunis-headquartered PLO leadership as enshrined in the  Gaza-Jericho accord; and to expose the resolutions of the UN  Security Council, which has turned into a pliable tool in the  hands of the United States and the Zionist enemy, one of our  units operating behind enemy lines laid an ambush for enemy  patrols in the al-'Ayshiyah-al-Rayhan mountainous area.    At 1200 on Monday, 21 March 1994, our heroic fighters opened  fire on a Zionist patrol. As usual, the enemy attempted to  underestimate its losses. However, it later admitted that two  of its soldiers were killed.    In view of the immense losses sustained by the enemy, the  Zionist aggression troops, in cooperation with the agent Lahd  troops, poured their terrorist firepower on the heads of  Lebanese and Palestinian civilians, targeting schools, markets,  and residential neighborhoods.    While underscoring the importance of stepping up armed  struggle, and while persisting with this jihad course, we, in  the PFLP-GC [Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command], believe the best reply to the  enemy's massacres; that is, protecting our people against its  terrorism, is only achievable when the fire of the blessed  intifadah is fuelled, and when the course of jihad and armed  struggle is nurtured.    We would like to address the following questions to all  those  engaged in bargaining: What do you call the current shelling  and killing of civilians? Is not the shelling of al-Nabatiyah,  Sidon, and 'Ayn al-Hulwah the epitome of terrorism?    Our open war against the Zionist enemy and the mujahidin  attacks are the resistance approach our people have chosen as a  way to liberate land and man.    We will apprise you of any new developments or details.    It is a revolution until the liberation of land and man.    [Signed] The PFLP-GC    [Dated] 22 March 1994     "

In the eastern, Shabwah axis, the valiant Armed  Forces units managed to capture the military base and the  central axis command headquarters in the city of 'Ataq, the  capital of the governorate. Thus, the Shabwah Governorate, with  all its districts and all its military installations, is now in  the hands of constitutional legitimacy.

The people greeted the Armed  Forces with open hearts and feelings of happiness in all  districts, expressing their absolute support for unity and  constitutional legitimacy, and taking part in action alongside  their great national Army, which is capable of defeating the  secessionists and their supporters.    On the Abyan-Lahij axis, the forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy continued their heroic and brave  tasks. They purged a number of defeated secessionist pockets,  making real advances and inflicting on the forces of apostasy  and secession major losses in hardware, weapons, and vehicles.    The units of the forces of unity and constitutional  legitimacy also managed to seize large quantities of arms and  military hardware, including a helicopter that was lying intact  after its crew had fled.

They had been taken away by the enemy in late January after  falling unconscious in a storm on the sea. But they steadfastly  defended the authority of the great leader President Kim Il-song  and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and bravely fought as  soldiers of comrade supreme commander, undaunted by the enemy's  relentless threat, appeasement and deception, and returned in  triumph.    When they drifted on the sea, General Kim Chong-il, supreme  commander, took all the measures necessary for saving them.  Upon hearing about their heroic deeds, he placed great  political confidence in them, granting them the honor of being  members of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and the title of  the Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the  ""Kim Il-song Youth Honor Prize.""    Addressing the meeting, Chairman of the Central Committee of  the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea Choe Yong-hae  said the heroic deeds displayed by them in a showdown with the  enemy clearly showed that if anyone bravely fought the enemy  with the revolutionary faith and indomitable will of trusting  and following only comrade supreme commander, he could surely  win in any adversity and return to the socialist homeland.    He called on all the working people to keep themselves in  full combat readiness to cope with the new war provocation moves  of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique,  and rise up like a mountain and defend the honor of chuche Korea  by becoming a fortress and shield, rifles and bombs, when  comrade supreme commander issued an order.    Kim Chol-chin said that they could return to the bosom of  the  great general after showing the prowess of young soldiers to the  enemy, because they were encouraged by the deep trust and  paternal affection of comrade supreme commander and they had the  rock-firm faith that they would win, guided by the general.    Representatives of factory and office workers, youth and  students vowed to defend the socialist homeland like an  impregnable fortress and dynamically accelerate socialist  construction with a rifle in one hand and a hammer or a pen in  the other, keeping in their mind the rock-firm faith that they  will surely win in any circumstances as General Kim Chong-il  leads them.

The 20 included Xu Honggang, a  heroic fighter who gallantly rose to defend a just cause. Jiang  Zemin said: We must carry forward the fine traditions of our  party and our armed forces, as well as the traditional virtues  of the Chinese nation, and make efforts to create a good mood in  society and promote socialist spiritual civilization.    Jiang Zemin, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and other  leading comrades met Xu Honggang and other advanced  representatives before attending a jointly sponsored army-people  party celebrating the Spring Festival. Zhang Zhen, Chi Haotian,  Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo and Fu Quanyou were also present.    Jiang Zemin praised highly the heroic deeds of Xu Honggang,  who defied brute force and took up the cudgels on behalf of a  just cause, as well as the noble conduct of people such as Zhan  Benfang, who helped rescue and protect soldiers. He said: The  deeds of Xu Honggang and Zhan Benfang embody the tradition of  the communist party, of the veteran Red Army, as well as the  fine tradition of the Army cherishing the people and the people  supporting the Army, and the traditional virtues of the Chinese  nation. We must properly publicize the deeds of people like Xu  Honggang in order to encourage good conduct, maintain social  unity and stability, and create a favorable social environment  for reform, opening up, and economic construction.    Xu Honggang is the squad leader of a communications company  under the Jinan Military Region. He was seriously injured after  bravely struggling with gangsters on a bus on 17 August. He was  rescued by Zhan Benfang, deputy director of a tax department in  Sichuan's Yulian County. The deeds of Xu Honggang and Zhan  Benfang and other heroes have been admiringly talked about among  the people. Xu Honggang and other `double support' models who  met the leaders said they would bear in mind the exhortations of  the leaders of the CPC Central Committee in order to do an even  better job of supporting the Army and giving preferential  treatment to the families of soldiers and martyrs, and in  supporting the government and cherishing the people.

Just as the Earth celebrates  the blossoms of April, every year our struggler Arab masses  celebrate the anniversary of the establishment of our great  party, the ASBP. [passage omitted]    Comrades, on the 47th anniversary of the establishment of  the  ASBP, I have the honor to convey to you on this great  anniversary, and through you to all the party's strugglers and  to all Arab strugglers, the greetings and congratulations of the  first Ba'thist, the leader of the march of our people and  nation, struggler comrade President Hafiz al-Asad. [applause]  At the same time, it pleases me to convey to you greetings and  congratulations from the party leadership, and its wishes for  further success on the road to the objectives of the party and  the masses: Unity, freedom, and socialism. [passage omitted  reviewing ASBP history, principles, and achievements]    Al-Asad's Syria today, with all worthiness, carries pan-Arab  concerns. It will not allow the loss of Arab rights. It is  capable of raising the cultural pan-Arab banner that is the  honorable image of our nation despite the difficult times  through which this nation is passing. The Geneva summit between  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton is considered an event  that confirmed that Syria's leader, the great Arab leader Hafiz  al-Asad, [applause] constitutes, before the world, the true  image and the nation's cultural face, committed to rights,  pride, and dignity. Within this framework, Syria is working to  reinforce Arab solidarity based on the ASBP's great pan-Arab  principles, to bolster the Arabs' role, and to coordinate their  efforts to liberate their occupied territories, restore their  usurped rights, and defend themselves in the face of the  challenges that threaten their present and future in a way that  proves that they reject humiliation, submission, and  capitulation to fait accompli. The right to defend oneself,  land, and rights, is a right recognized by all the world's laws  and charters. Struggle for liberation is also a right and a  national duty to every people whose land was occupied and whose  rights were violated. Al-Asad's Syria, just as it was in the  past, will not be prevented from playing its pan-Arab role in  defending Arab rights by any pressure, false accusations, and  unjust lists on which the Zionist lobby insists. For a long  time, this lobby has been used to working in the United States  to drag its administration into creating a rift in Syrian-U.S.  relations, and to try to disrupt Syria's position toward the  peace process, especially since this lobby and its henchmen are  angered by Syria's abidance with Arab rights and constants, and  by the diplomatic successes it has made, which were clearly  displayed by Syria's dealing with the peace process through  adherence to Arab rights, and confrontation of Israel's  intransigence and crude terrorism.    Comrades, brothers: Based on all this, Syria has offered  great pan-Arab sacrifices to support brothers everywhere. By  doing so, it had no motives other than the great pan-Arab  motive, which is entrenched in ASBP ideology and thought which  was expanded and enriched by the thought of the honest leader  Hafiz al-Asad and his limitless sacrifices. [applause] It is  the pan-Arab understanding of the issue of the Arab-Israeli  conflict, which is the pivot of the activities of al-Asad's  Syria and its struggle within the framework of achieving a just  and comprehensive solution to this conflict based on restoring  the occupied Arab territories and the usurped rights in  accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and the land  for peace principle. Syria joined the peace process in the  region, which is based on the international legitimacy, more  than two years ago in order to be a means to achieving clear  objectives, whose contents were included in UN Security Council  Resolutions No. 242, 338, and 425, and the land for peace  formula. It has exerted continuous efforts to contribute to the  success of this process and to achieve its objectives of  establishing a just, comprehensive, and honorable peace.  However, Israel has not stopped, through its maneuverings and  practices since the outset of the peace process, to obstruct  this process and to divert it from its basic objectives, as part  of its plans to impose capitulation on the Arabs.    Comrades, Syria does not agree that this process should be  derailed from its specified track, and the formula agreed on in  Madrid. Syria has confronted, and is resolutely confronting all  the Israeli maneuvering, intransigence, and attempts to evade  the requirements and prerequisites of peace, foremost of which  are the withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and  the recognition of the Palestinian Arab people's legitimate  rights. [applause] Israel is still resorting to the means that  enable it to divert the peace process from its objective. After  it dealt separately with the Palestinian side through the Oslo  agreement in an attempt to strike at Arab coordination and to  weaken the Arab position, it perpetrated the holy Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre, whose hideousness is beyond any one's  imagination. It was also behind the massacre perpetrated at the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church. The objective behind all this is to  abort peace efforts and to foil the Arabs' efforts to restore  their rights and territories. The UN Security Council's  denunciation of the abhorrent holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre,  through its Resolution No. 904, shows that the whole world began  to complain about Israel's terrorist behavior, and began to  expose Israel's intransigence and adherence to fascism and  occupation. This is despite the fact that the resolution itself  is not commensurate with the hideous nature of the crime. Nor  does it constitute sufficient deterrence to the terrorist  behavior of which Israel has been known since the beginning of  its continuous aggression against the Arabs.    Comrades, brothers: The quick pursuit of those who exploded  the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Lebanon has exposed those  involved in successive explosions. They are linked with Israel  and work to execute its schemes. This proves the fraternal  people of Lebanon are determined to foil Israeli plots to  reinvolve Lebanon in acts of violence and to disrupt its efforts  to achieve stability and national accord, and to liberate  southern Lebanon. These plots use the most hideous and the  crudest means of terrorism, as we saw at Sayyidat al-Najat  Church and before, and as we see in what is taking place in  occupied southern Lebanon everyday. The measures the Lebanese  Government has taken to confront the conspirators against  Lebanon's security and stability, and to confront all those who  would contribute to returning Lebanon to the whirlpool of  violence and fighting, were received with great satisfaction  inside and outside Lebanon. These measures, which are backed by  Syria, have contributed to exposing tools manipulated from  outside Lebanon in order to implement Israeli schemes. These  measures have exposed Israel's intentions against Lebanon. They  prove the march of security and accord in Lebanon is stronger  than all who want this fraternal country to return to the  climate of war, violence, and destruction. [applause]    Comrades, brothers: The struggle of our zealous kinsfolk in  the Golan and their valiant confrontation of the occupation  troops, the valiant Palestinian intifadah in the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip, and the heroic Lebanese resistance in southern  Lebanon, are all important factors that integrate with Syria's  struggle to impose the Arab right on an intransigent Israel that  wants peace with land. As its leader, the great Arab leader  Hafiz al-Asad [applause] said, Syria will not relinquish a  single inch of the Golan and the other occupied Arab  territories. Neither will it give up any Arab rights. Syria is  confronting all the obstacles Israel places on the road to peace  with the objective of arriving at a just and comprehensive peace  in the region that restores full Arab rights and territories to  their people, and opens the doors of free development and  progress to the region's peoples, avoiding aggression, hegemony,  tyranny, and occupation.    Comrades, based on the humanitarian dimension of the  pan-Arab  movement and the Arab nation's civilization and culture, the  ASBP established a network of relations with several parties,  organizations, and liberation movements, to gain the greatest  possible support for our Arab issues, and to confront the  world's misleading Zionist media. These relations are part of  the peoples' common struggle to build a world free of all forms  of aggression, hegemony, tyranny, and the policy of variable  standards--a world based on justice, equality, and respect for  every people's right to opt for their own way of development  with complete freedom.    Developments in the international arena prove the end of  the Cold War has not brought security, stability, and peace, as  indicated by the slogans that accompanied its end. The number  of conflicts, tensions, and civil wars has increased. They have  escalated in several countries, such as Afghanistan, Somalia,  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the former Soviet Republics, and in other  countries and continents. These countries feel they are left to  fight, as if they exist outside this world. In fact, the  policies of hegemony and tyranny, and the hostility to Arabs and  Muslims, have increased the pains of peoples and made their  causes a field for external interference and a game for the  balances of power and interests in the world.    Comrades: We stress that world peace, security, and  stability, are an indivisible whole. It is necessary to  consider all peoples' interests and aspirations, aside from all  forms of fascism, Zionism, hegemony, and tyranny, and aside from  the policies of aggression, nuclear arms, and mass destruction  weapons stockpiled by those who took the policy of aggression  and hegemony against peoples as a profession. Taking all  peoples' interests into consideration is an indispensable  condition for building a new world order based on democracy in  international relations, on justice, equality, and mutual  respect, and on eliminating the current discrimination among the  world's poor and rich, north, and south.    Comrades, based on a rich experience gradually built by the  party until it grew and became strong, and proceeding from the  sacrifices and energies of a great leader who is leading the  contemporary pan- Arab struggle, the honest leader Hafiz al-Asad  [applause] -- based on all this, we are optimistic about the  future. On this occasion, the party's 47th anniversary, we  renew the pledge to pursue the march with a greater  determination and stronger enthusiasm behind our honest, symbol  leader Hafiz al-Asad. [applause] A march that is led by Hafiz  al-Asad has no choice but to go ahead toward further victories  and achievements.    Comrades, on this occasion, on behalf of you, all the  party's  strugglers, and all the Arab strugglers, I send heartfelt  greetings and congratulations to the leader of the march of our  people and nation, the secretary general of the party, and the  president of the republic, struggler leader Hafiz al-Asad.  [applause] Greetings to all the Ba'thist strugglers in the  entire greater Arab homeland. Greetings to our struggler Arab  masses, the source of the party's inspiration and the minaret of  its policies and march. Greetings to our steadfast kinsfolk in  the heroic Golan. Greetings to the sons of our people, the  heroes of the heroic Palestinian intifadah, to the valiant  resistance men in southern Lebanon, and to all Arab strugglers.  All greetings to the leader of the march of our people, party,  and nation to victory and liberation, the honest leader,  struggler comrade Hafiz al-Asad. [applause]     "

We realize Nabil Sha'th's need to expedite the achievement  of  his dream so that the doors will open to his political  consultations and his trade companies for his sons and relatives  so that they can enter the territories that have been forbidden  to them and so that they can inherit the companies,  institutions, calculators, and typewriters of the coming  authority. But, we wanted Nabil Sha'th and his group to visit,  instead, one of the Zionist barriers that prevent our people  from reaching the al-Aqsa Mosque to perform their prayers and  from reaching the markets so that the defenseless citizens will  be able to buy even some of their necessities and find some food  for their children.    Our correspondents from the West Bank and Gaza Strip report:  We wanted Nabil Sha'th to see al-Malha market, which was built  by the Zionist enemy, so that he could see how the operation of  stabbing two Zionist soldiers yesterday has shown the  ineffectiveness of the Zionist siege on Jerusalem and its  suburbs.    We wanted Sha'th to come to Ya'bad and Barta'ah to see how  the soldiers of terrorist Rabin raid our people's homes and  wreak havoc and destruction inside them. But, Sha'th insists on  staying in Cairo. From there, he can emerge from his seclusion,  which has lasted more than 24 hours, to stand in front of  cameras and television screens and announce that an agreement  has been reached, which he has announced dozens of times. He  insists on staying in Cairo so that he can meet with Shulamit  Aloni, the Zionist minister who has bragged in front of many  Arabs that the doors of the entire world are now open to the  Zionist entity.    Sha'th insists on seclusion until the signing of the  agreement but, of course, he does not hesitate to receive the  raven, the godfather [al-ghurab al-'arrab], Christopher, after  his U.S.-Zionist administration granted the so-called self-rule  policemen cars to be used to protect the Zionist settlers in  Gaza and Jericho and to repress our people who stress their  rejection of the accord of disgrace and treason.    What really counts is not seclusion but the continued heroic  actions, like yesterday, which was known as the day of knife war.    As we wait for the results of the open session, until the  'Arafat-Zionist agreement is signed, and for the results of  Christopher's tour of the region, Zionist terrorism against our  people continues, far from the atmosphere of Sha'th's optimism.  Moreover, land confiscation continues in order to open more  settlement roads and to displace our people.    Within this context, terrorist (Gabriash 'Ahahl), the  so-called security officer in the settlement council in Hebron,  warned about another massacre similar to the holy al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre. It should also be noted that the head of the  settlements council in Qiryat Arba' earlier made threats before  the Zionist committee investigating the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre that a new massacre would be perpetrated in Hebron by a  settler using a machine gun against the Arabs.    Our kinsfolk in Hebron, who are facing this Zionist threat  with more patience and giving, refuted the military spokesman's  claims that martyr al-Waridat tried to stab a Zionist soldier.  Citing eyewitnesses, the Zionist newspaper THE JERUSALEM POST  affirms that these claims are false. The paper notes that these  claims are false and that the criminal soldier had been known to  be carrying out repressive and barbaric acts against the  citizens in Hebron for weeks.    At the end of their news report, our correspondents warned  against Zionist deception in light of this game of distracting  the attention of the Palestinians by preoccupying them with the  issue of redeploying Rabin's soldiers in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho. It has also been noted that the Zionists are taking  advantage of certain gaps in our people's ranks, created by  'Arafat's supporters, in order to strike at their unity and  undermine their efforts through secondary issues which, as  everyone knows, are nothing more than a cheap Zionist bribe to  the pro-'Arafat delegation in order to peddle the accord of  treason.    Moreover, the our correspondents warned against these  meetings that some Palestinian opposition members are holding  with representatives of the Zionist Israeli military command,  which is not seeking their opinion on the Muslims' position on  the Oslo accord inasmuch as they are seeking to drive a wedged  into the Palestinian ranks and to break their solidarity for  refusing to deal with the Zionists.

I wanted to convey to you now, however, that I felt great  satisfaction and joy when I learned that you have successfully  concluded that very important project.    I have been continuously informed on the development of the  work by Comrade [Politburo member Julian] Rizo and, more  recently, by the reports published in our press.    The figures clearly and eloquently speak of the deed you  have  accomplished: More than 270,000 truckloads of various materials  were used; almost 2 million cubic meters of rock were dumped  into the sea; over 43 km of highway were built; and all that was  completed in just 54 months and 18 days of intensive and  unselfish work under very difficult conditions.    Such achievements are possible only where there are groups  of  workers like those of that contingent, men and women with the  same resolution and will to work that you have demonstrated. It  is no secret to you that the current circumstances in the  country give a strategic significance to the effort we must make  to create, at a more accelerated rate, the minimal structure  that will help us increase our tourist capacity and enhance the  quality of service in that sphere.    The rockfill embankment you have just completed is a  concrete  contribution to that priority effort, which is the same as  saying that it is a contribution to the historic battle we are  fighting today in defense of our independence, of national  identity, of the future of the fatherland, of the Revolution,  and of socialism.    I am pleased to know that we can count on such a group of  hard workers as you are, especially now that most of the people  are waging a heroic battle on all fronts to overcome this  special period. You have played a leading role in another heroic  deed, showing once more the spirit of fight and the  revolutionary awareness that makes us increasingly stronger and  more invincible.    I wholeheartedly congratulate you and thank you on behalf of  the Cuban people for the contribution you have made. I also urge  you to continue to be the pride of our working class, especially  of the construction workers.    [Signed] Affectionately, Fidel Castro.     "

0,FT943-6618 ,"FT943-6618 _AN-EH1APAECFT 940827   FT  27 AUG 94 / Outdoors: I flew around the hairpin at 130mph - Peter Whitehead swapped his commuter bike for a racer and tested his skill and courage on the track      By PETER WHITEHEAD   Motor cyclists live in a strange world of exaggeration. They travel at exotic speeds - always above 100mph - they can never be beaten away from traffic lights, and they never have bumps or scrapes, just heroic acts of derring-do. I know this because I am a motor cyclist. And like other motor cyclists, I have felt the rush of adrenalin that accompanies riding at speed and I have heard the call of the race track. I can also hear myself exaggerating: 'Put me on a superbike and I could break the lap record in a grand prix.' Such boasts are now so much hot exhaust. I have been caught out - sent to school and found wanting. On one of Britain's racing circuits I discovered that blasting around a track pushes you to the limit: it is a test of courage and confidence in your own skill and in the capabilities of the machine beneath you. As a birthday treat, I was packed off to Mallory Park in Leicestershire to join a class at the Drayton Croft Racing School. There it was that my bluff was called. I was fast but not quite fast enough. Exact speed is a mystery as the school's bikes have no speedometers but, without exaggeration, it must have been 100mph on the straights. I had begun to tremble even during the pre-school pep talk - 'If you see oil on the track, avoid it . . . If you 'high-side' it will hurt . . .' By the mid-session de-briefing I was speechless. When asked a simple question - 'How is it going?' - I felt strangled, my reply spluttering into nothing like a clapped-out engine refusing to start. Here I was, a commuter grappling with a highly-tuned 130mph-plus Honda VFR400R racing bike, and all I had learnt about riding and roadcraft now seemed wrong. I was looking ahead, seeing the coming bend and slowing as if on my way to work, rather than maximising my speed on every inch of track. I was weighed down by years of road experience on two and four wheels, and knocked off balance by the sudden need for naked aggression. Overcoming this background was clearly going to require more than the hour or so we had been allotted on the circuit. But my fellow students seemed to have grasped the idea rather more quickly as they flashed past in their turquoise or mauve leathers, hired for the occasion. There were 16 of us on the track for that hour-and-a-bit, divided into four groups of four, each with an instructor to guide us round the 1.4-mile circuit. Steve Bevington, the tutor allocated to my turquoise quartet, briefed us briefly and finished with: '. . . so follow me.' This was easier said than done. Out of the pits, round Gerards curve, along Stebbe Straight, and I was keeping up nicely with Bevington and the rest of the class. But a gap began to open up through the Lake Esses. 'Hang on,' I gasped as the screeching Honda engine below me begged to be shifted a gear or two higher. I closed up a little on the approach to the hairpin, fell back through the chicane, missed a gear as I was changing up on the adversely-cambered Devil's Elbow leading to the Kirkby Straight, and that was it. The thimbleful of confidence I had begun with was spilled on the track and only occasionally did I catch sight of my class-mates from this point on. We did meet up again in the pits for that mid-session 'discussion'. Bevington wanted to assess our performances; he sensibly arranged to assess mine separately. I had already witnessed the astonishing speed and nonchalance of the other instructors flashing past, one hand on the throttle, the other on the hip, as they glanced over their shoulders. This time the glance was at me, and to my total amazement Bevington raised his thumb. Back in the changing room, the 15 survivors - one had hurtled into a fence and been bundled into an ambulance with seemingly minor injuries - were handed their certificates and 'Rider Analysis Sheets'. Bevington's generous marking awarded me nine out of 10 for position on the track, application of instruction, and improvement. And he definitely hit the spot with his low marks for confidence and potential. 'Good improvement. Well done,' he wrote at the bottom. With those words glowing inside me, I set off home - at 150mph, of course.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P7948 Racing, Including Track Operation.

0,FT924-4251 ,"FT924-4251 _AN-CLCB9AC4FT 921203   FT  03 DEC 92 / Arts: Fidelio in concert      By DAVID MURRAY   Andrew Litton brought his Bournemouth Symphony and Chorus, and an interesting septet of principals, to the Festival Hall for a concert performance of Fidelio on Tuesday. After a couple of Beethoven-less operatic seasons, any Fidelio is better than none; and the Bournemouth one was considerably better than that. Litton has a nice, unshowy grasp of the score: sound tempi, duly accommodating of the voices, and excellent appreciation of Beethoven's long, tension-building piano passages, which premature surges always diminish. The orchestra played very well and the chorus were sturdy. Including the 'Leonora no. 3' overture in the place where Mahler intruded it, however - between the spouses' private reunion and the public explosion of relief - was surely a mistake. That needs a theatrical justification, beyond the original plea for extra scene-shifting time. Here it merely lengthened the performance of an opera which is notably concise, and postponed the human finale for too long. In any case, the homely, domestic aspect of Fidelio - its 'Singspiel' side - faded with the placement of the singers behind the orchestra. Fine for heroic voices (Leonora's and Florestan's); but deeply unhelpful for little Marzelline and Jaquino, and even old Father Rocco. As the green young pair, Linda Kitchen and the French-Canadian tenor Benoit Boutet were attractive and gracefully musical, and Donald McIntyre's Rocco suggested gruff depths, but from an awkward distance where the action wants to be cosy-cottagy. Jane Eaglen's weighty Leonora covered the distance in heroic strides, stately rather than tomboyish, but with imposing gravity. As Florestan, the young American Heldentenor Edward Cook unleashed some ringing timbre and much erratic feeling: plenty of promise, no cogent grasp yet of the size and shape of his crucial 'Gott] welch' Dunkel hier]' scena. As hateful Don Pizarro and beneficent Don Fernando, Alan Opie and Matthew Best were more than competent, if slightly less well-focussed than we know they can manage.

Marking the KPA founding anniversary -- a felicitous  revolutionary day -- I warmly congratulate the courageous  officers and men of the KPA and the Korean People's Security  Forces, who are firmly defending the defense line of the  fatherland by cherishing a lofty sense of loyalty to the party  and to the revolution, in the name of the Political Bureau of  the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee and of the  Central Military Commission of the party, under the  authorization of the respected comrade supreme commander.  [applause]    I also express the lofty sense of reverence to the  anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs and to the patriotic  fighters of the People's Army, who dedicated their precious  lives for independence and liberation of the fatherland, for  freedom of the people, for the party and for the revolution.  [applause]    I extend warm congratulations to the old anti-Japanese  fighters, old war veterans, disabled soldiers, and discharged  soldiers, who registered heroic feats in the arduous  anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and in the great fatherland  liberation war and who are continuously blooming the  revolutionary flowers of the socialist construction today.  [applause]    I send warm greetings to all people who are vigorously  struggling to defend, protect, and glorify the popular  mass-centered socialism of our own style in firm unity with the  party and the leader and who love and sincerely help the  People's Army as if they are their own offspring. [applause]    Comrades, more than 60 years have passed since our people  founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army [KPRA] -- their  first revolutionary armed forces -- to achieve the cause of  national liberation by upholding the banner of the chuche idea.  At this significant occasion of commemorating the 62d  anniversary of the founding of the KPA today, we are recalling  with deep emotion the path of honorable struggle along which our  revolutionary armed forces have traversed and their immortal  achievements.    The cause of independence and the cause of socialism of the  popular masses are carried out in a fierce confrontation and  struggle against the imperialists and all sorts of  reactionaries, and these causes can be carried out successfully  by the armed support of the revolutionary armed forces. The  country and people without their mighty revolutionary armed  forces cannot defend the fatherland and the revolution from the  imperialists' aggression, nor can they victoriously advance the  cause of socialism.    The cause of building the revolutionary armed forces in our  country was pioneered by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song,  and it was continuously deepened and developed by the victorious  advance of the chuche revolutionary cause.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth a policy on  building genuine revolutionary armed forces to organize and  improve the armed struggle against the Japanese imperialists  based on his deep insight into the historical lesson of our  country's anti-Japanese movement for national liberation learned  during the period he pioneered the course of the Korean  revolution. This was a revolutionary policy purporting that the  Korean revolution must be carried out by the Korean people  themselves. It was an original policy that opened a new road  for the anticolonial war for national liberation and for the  building of the revolutionary armed forces. [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song formed the KPRA on 25  April 1932 based on a strong political and military foundation,  which he himself provided through his energetic struggle to  realize his policy on building the revolutionary armed forces,  and proclaimed the founding of our revolutionary armed forces to  the entire world. [applause]    The founding of the KPRA was a magnificent birth of true  chuche-type revolutionary armed forces in our country. It was a  historic event that brought forth a momentous turning point in  our people's anti-Japanese struggle for national liberation and  in the development of their communist movement. [applause]    With the founding of the KPRA, our people could victoriously  wage the struggle, on a new higher plane, for the independence  of the country and the liberation of the people with their  genuine revolutionary armed forces. This was the very starting  point of the glorious history of our revolutionary armed forces.  Our revolutionary armed forces have traversed a proud  victorious road for the past six decades through the blaze of  the stern and arduous struggle. With their heroic struggle, our  revolutionary armed forces have made immortal achievements that  will shine long in the history of the country. [applause]    The respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il has noted: Our People's Army has waged a heroic  struggle to defend the party and the leader and to defend the  gains of the country and the revolution and has made great  accomplishments for the party and the revolution. The KPRA,  which was the first rank of our revolutionary armed forces, had  to wage a bloody struggle against the strong imperialist enemy  right from the time of its founding. The anti-Japanese  revolutionary struggle was the most glorious revolutionary war  in which our revolutionary armed forces defeated powerful  imperialists, fighting with them over a protracted period of  time under unprecedented arduous and grim conditions.    During the severe anti-Japanese revolutionary war, when  there was no rear area of the nation or support from regular  armed forces, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song victoriously  organized and led the KPRA while solving difficult and complex  problems raised in the course of implementing the general Korean  revolution, including the armed struggle, in an original way  based on a chuche- oriented position. [applause]    The KPRA men fully demonstrated the revolutionary Army's  militant power everywhere by using chuche-oriented hit-and-run  tactics under the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's  extraordinary military and political leadership. At last, our  revolutionary armed forces smashed the Japanese imperialist  aggressors and brilliantly achieved the historic cause of  liberalizing the fatherland by carrying out the heroic struggle  for 15 years while overcoming various trials beyond man's  imagination. [applause]    During the fortitude anti-Japanese struggle, the  single-hearted unity of revolutionary ranks around the leader  [suryong] was achieved, vivid models of the faithfulness of  upholding the leader [yongdoja] were created, and our party's  brilliant revolutionary traditions were firmly prepared. These  are deep and stout roots of our party and Army, as well as an  eternal footstone that guarantees the victory of our revolution.  [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song strengthened and  developed the KPRA into the regular armed forces, KPA, in a  short period following the liberalization, based on the  revolutionary armed forces' valuable traditions prepared in the  period of the anti-Japanese struggle. The KPA, the direct  descendant of the KPRA, has been strengthened and developed into  modern, regular armed forces and has excellently fulfilled its  honorable mission in defending our party's cause. The  invincible might of the KPA was fully demonstrated in the  fatherland liberation war, which was a great revolutionary war  in which our people defended their fatherland after defeating  [tasung] the U.S. imperialists, the head of world imperialism,  for the first time in history by carrying out the heroic  all-people struggle.    While saddling himself with the heavy burden for both the  front and the rear in the severe period of the life-and-death  war -- decisive to the destiny of the fatherland -- the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song united the entire party, the entire  Army, and all the people as one and organized and mobilized them  to the sublime struggle to destroy the enemies, thus leading the  fatherland liberation war to victory. [applause]    Upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's orders, the  wise and brave soldiers of our Army, Navy, and Air Force rose as  one and sagaciously fought to defend every inch of the  fatherland at the cost of their blood, while bearing deep in  mind their lofty mission for the fatherland the people.    Heroic feats of the People's Army officers and men, who  guaranteed the victory in the war by destroying the enemy's  tanks and warships with human bombs and by blocking the enemy's  guns with their hearts on the field of fierce battle with the  enemy, will be handed down forever with the history of the great  fatherland liberation war. [applause]    During the period of the arduous war, all the people in the  rear area, regardless of age or sex, rose and supported [wonho]  the front line and ensured wartime production by defending their  plants and villages. Thus, they made great contributions to the  victory of the war.    Officers and men of our People's Army inflicted disgraceful  defeat on the U.S. imperialist aggressors, who boasted being the  strongest in the world, by demonstrating mass heroism and a  sense of peerless sacrifice in the great fatherland liberation  war. Thus, they honorably defended independence of the  fatherland and sovereignty of the people. [applause]    Our people, who rose in a just fight against an armed  invasion of the imperialists, won active support and  encouragement from hundreds of millions of people in the world.  In particular, the Chinese people, who carried out a common  struggle against the Japanese imperialists for a long time,  dispatched support forces under the slogan: ""Resist America and  aid Korea,"" and helped our people's struggle with their blood.  Our people are always grateful to our friends for the sincere  support and encouragement they extended to us during the most  arduous period. We will never forget them. [applause]    Our people won victory in fights against the two most  atrocious and strong imperialist powers in the anti-Japanese  revolutionary war and in the fatherland liberation war. These  victories were vigorous demonstrations of the might and  invincibility of our revolutionary ranks, who are firmly rallied  behind the party and the leader. [applause]    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward the  self-defense military line for converting the entire Army into a  cadre Army, for modernizing the entire Army, for arming all  people, and for turning the whole country into a fortress, in  conformity with the demand of the situation created after the  war and of the development of our revolution. He also put  forward the outstanding and unique line for advancing economic  construction and national defense construction at the same time.  He wisely led the struggle to implement the line.    With thorough implementation of the party's line, our  People's Army has been strengthened to a  one-a-match-for-one-hundred revolutionary armed forces, and our  nation came to highly display its dignified appearance as a  strong independent, self-reliant, and self-defensive socialist  country. [applause]    The People's Army smashed every step of the enemy's constant  aggression and war provocation maneuvers, and reliably defended  the security of the nation and the people. Thus, the People's  Army made a great contribution to construction projects for the  nation's prosperity and the people's happiness. Whenever the  revolution faced an arduous trial, our People's Army tenaciously  defended and protected the party and the leader at the van of  struggle, and actively carried to accomplishment the party's  line and policy.    When the situation at home and abroad was complicated and  difficult after the war, the People's Army firmly defended the  party's cause with arms by upholding the slogan: ""Let us defend  with our lives the party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim  Il-song!""    At the same time, our People's Army displayed heroic feats  in  the great socialist construction by upholding the slogan of  loyalty: ""What the party decides, we will do!"" Thus, it  honorably fulfilled its mission as the Army of the leader, of  the party, and of the people. [applause]    Indeed, the brilliant history of our people's revolution has  been embroidered with proud feats of our revolutionary Armed  Forces registered before the nation and people. The great  creations built on the land of the fatherland contain precious  blood and sweat of officers and men of the People's Army. Today  our People's Army has entered a new historic period of its  development by following the outstanding and refined leadership  of Comrade Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, and an epochal  turn is being effected in all domains of building the Army.  [applause]    Our comrade supreme commander, who directed great efforts  to strengthen and develop the People's Army at an early date,  put forward the outstanding line of building the Army and  remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea in compliance with  the new demand of development of the revolution, and  energetically led the struggle to implement the line. The line  of remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea is the most  just program for building the Army, which enables us to make  officers and men of the People's Army genuine revolutionary  vanguards who are unswervingly loyal to the party and to the  leader and to provide reliable military insurance for the  socialist cause by accomplishing the chuche-based cause for  building the Army. [applause]    The line of remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea  has  been vigorously accelerated under the outstanding leadership of  the respected comrade supreme commander, and as a result, the  chuche-based system of commanding the Army, under which the  entire Army moves as one under the leadership of the party, has  been firmly established within the People's Army. The chuche  idea has been thoroughly embodied in all domains of building the  Army and military activities, and single-hearted unity and  tradition of loyalty have been brilliantly inherited.    Today all ranks of the People's Army are filled with  death-defying determination to loyally uphold the leadership of  the party, no matter what storm and trial may come forward, and  to become a fortress and a shield to defend and protect the  respected comrade supreme commander. [applause]    Our comrade supreme commander developed the chuche-oriented  tactics in compliance with the demand of modern warfare and with  the concrete conditions in our country, and wisely led us to  build a powerful modern defense industry and to constantly  strengthen combat capabilities and armed equipment of the  People's Army. Under the leadership of the respected comrade  supreme commander, our People's Army has been fostered to be a  loyal combat unit capable of fighting for the party and the  leader by dedicating its life and one-a-match-for-one-hundred  strong Army with all sorts of powerful offensive and defensive  means. Our revolutionary Armed Forces are upholding as their  supreme commander the great general and great commander who has  indomitable will and courage and outstanding strategy and  alchemy. Herein lies the guarantee for all victories and for  constant strengthening and developing of our revolutionary Armed  Forces. [applause]    Together with the People's Army, combat capabilities of the  Red Worker-Peasant Militia and Red Youth Guard have been  remarkably strengthened, and all people have been armed and the  whole country has been further consolidated as an impregnable  fortress.    Our party's idea for military-people unity has been  brilliantly embodied in the entire Army and whole society, and  as a result, blood ties between the military and people have  been further intensified at a new higher stage. As long as we  have the revolutionary Armed Forces, which have been  strengthened and developed into indomitable combat ranks, and as  long as we have the all-people defense system with the People's  Army as its center, we can smash any aggressor and firmly defend  the party's cause -- the socialist cause. We can say this with  confidence. [applause]    The party, the Army, and the people are firmly united as one  with our comrade supreme commander -- the great military  strategist and iron-willed sagacious commander -- as the center,  and constitute a strong independent main force of the  revolution. Therefore, our socialism is advancing victoriously  without wavering even in the midst of violent upheaval.  [applause]    This invincible might of our revolution was verified again  through a severe trial last year. Last year's political and  military confrontation between our people and the U.S.  imperialists was a large battle without gunshots. It was also  an all-people, life-and-death battle to protect our party and  the socialist fatherland.    When the fatherland and the revolution faced a grave trial,  our comrade supreme commander took the stern self-defensive  measure of declaring a semi-war state of the entire nation, all  the people, and the entire Army to cope with the then-prevailing  situation.    After receiving the supreme commander's order from the  bottom  of their hearts, officers and men of the People's Army and all  the people launched as one into the struggle to protect the  country's sovereignty and revolutionary gains and honorably  defended the dignity and safety of their socialist fatherland by  smashing the enemy's challenge and aggression maneuver. This  was a victory of our comrade supreme commander's extraordinary  military strategies, braveness, and iron-firm faith and will as  well as a great victory of the single-hearted unity of the  leader, the party, and the masses. [applause]    The valuable achievements and immortal feats registered by  our revolutionary Armed Forces were a brilliant victory of the  chuche- oriented military ideology of the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song and the respected and beloved supreme commander  Comrade Kim Chong-il as well as the result of the outstanding  and seasoned leadership of the party and the leader. [applause]    At this meaningful moment of commemorating the 62d  anniversary of the founding of the KPA, I extend the greatest  honor and the warmest gratitude, along with the boundless  admiration and fervent loyalty of all people across the country  and of the People's Army officers and men, to Comrade Kim  Il-song, the great leader of our party and our people, who  founded our revolutionary Armed Forces at an early age and has  led them along the single road of victory, thus greatly  demonstrating the honor of our fatherland and our nation and  building a firm military guarantee for the completion of the  socialist cause in our country, and to the respected and beloved  supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, an extraordinary  military genius. [applause]    Comrades:    Today's situation for our revolution is very complicate and  tense. We must build socialism amid fierce confrontation with  the enemy and achieve the historic cause of national  reunification. The U.S. imperialists and reactionaries have  unprecedentedly strengthened anti-Republic maneuvers in order to  isolate and crush our nation -- the stronghold of socialism --  on pretext of the so-called nuclear problem. By bringing  numerous war means and troops into South Korea, they are leading  the situation on the Korean peninsula into the brink of war  while militarily threatening us. We should further strengthen  the People's Army to accelerate the revolution and construction  and to firmly defend the popular masses-oriented socialism of  our own style under today's acute situation.    The might of the People's Army lies, above all, in its  political and ideological superiority. We should intensify the  party's political work in the People's Army so as to firmly arm  all soldiers with the chuche idea and to make them resolute  revolutionary fighters who do not hesitate in sacrificing their  youth and lives for the party, the leader, the fatherland, and  the people.    The endless loyalty to the party's leadership is the life of  the People's Army. Officers and men of the People's Army should  thoroughly establish a revolutionary military trait, with which  the entire Army acts as one according to the supreme commander's  order, and should make all ranks of the People's Army filled  with the revolutionary, militant military spirit of working and  living in conformity with the party's ideology and intent.  [applause]    The ethos of unity between officers and men and between the  party and society is an important content of the ideological  superiority of the People's Army and lofty trait to be  maintained by all soldiers. The officers and men of the People's  Army should show the unity between the upper and lower levels,  continue to highly display the ethos of unity between officers  and men and between the party and society with which they help  and lead each other, and further be possessed with lofty traits  of a revolutionary army.    The political and ideological superiority of the People's  Army can display its invincible might when it is combined with  military and technological preparedness. In accordance with the  party's military line of self-reliance, we should thoroughly  implement the party's policy of turning the whole Army into an  army of cadres, a modernized army, and continue to exert efforts  to make all the people armored and fortify the entire country,  thereby fortify the self-reliant national defense power that is  able to resolutely defend and safeguard the popular  masses-centered socialism of our own style in any changing  situation. [applause]    The People's Army should put emphasis on combat and  political  training as the fundamental task and thoroughly implement the  training methods and principles presented by the party. All  soldiers should be strongly armed with our party's military  strategic ideology and chuche-motivated war method, foster them  as one-a-match-for-a-hundred fighters with high combat  efficiency suitable for modern war, and further reinforce the  People's Army companies. Highly displaying the traditional  ethos of army-people unity is important for strengthening the  People's Army and completing the preparations for a combat.  Only when the People's Army help the people--the people  actively support the Army, and the Army and the people literally  become harmoniously united--can the People's Army be  strengthened and developed into a matchless rank and win the  fights against the enemies.    Officers of the People's Army should maintain the spirit of  devoted service for the fatherland and the people, and continue  to demonstrate heroic feats in the struggle to build socialist  economy and protect the people's lives and property. The people  should establish social ethos that stresses military affairs,  and love and sincerely support the People's Army as family. In  this way, the Army and the people can firmly be prepared to  fight as one sharing the destiny of life and death in the  contingency.    The single-hearted unity between the party and the  revolutionary rank should be strengthened by all means. The  single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses is  our party's revolutionary philosophy and our revolution's mighty  weapon. As did in the past, we should face the enemies with  single-hearted unity in the future to push forward and complete  our revolution with the might of single-hearted unity.  [applause]    All the people and the KPA officers and men should be loyal  toward the party and the leader and have their belief and  character, and defend our firmly united revolutionary rank's  single-hearted unity around the respected and beloved comrade  supreme commander like the apples of the eyes.    Economic construction is an important work for firmly  building up our socialist revolutionary position. In this  regard, we should thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary  economic strategy so as to further strengthen and highly display  the superiority of socialism of our own style. In order to  thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic  strategy, we should highly manifest the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude.    We should break through difficulties and obstacles in  socialist economic construction with a revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude, and at the same time we should  continue to work without faltering with the firm ideological  determination to carry out assigned revolutionary tasks with our  own strength. National reunification is the nation's supreme  task that should not be delayed even for a moment. We should  achieve the cause of national reunification at the earliest  possible date to achieve our nation's unanimous desire. Thus, we  should hand a reunified fatherland over to our next generations.    Our party and the Government of the Republic have made all  sincere efforts to achieve national reunification under the  principle of national independence in conformity with the desire  of the whole nation and the desire of the times. However, a  graver obstacle has been created on the road ahead of national  reunification because of the maneuvers of the United States and  the South Korean authorities.    The United States is adhering to the military adventure  [kunsajok mohom] to crush [apsal] our Republic by stepping up  anti-Republic pressure commotions more openly in the  international arena over our nuclear problem. The South Korean  authorities frequently stage large-scale military exercises  against our Republic in collusion with outside forces and are  driving North-South relations to a dangerous phase while talking  about military countermeasures and an international cooperation  system under the pretext of our nuclear problem.    All of these moves in South Korea show that traitor Kim  Yong-sam is precisely an out-and-out flunkeyist nation-seller  who surpasses successive puppets, a treacherous and wicked  fascist hangman, and implacable warmaniac.    As for our nuclear problem that the U.S. imperialists and  their followers are clamoring about, it is a product of the  antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers that the United States  has been tenaciously perpetrating. It is precisely the United  States who brought nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula and  is actually threatening us. It is also the United States who  clamors about the suspicion of the nonexistent nuclear  development in the North. Even now the United States is  deploying improved new type missiles to South Korea and is,  thus, further strengthening military pressure on us. This proves  that the United States has not renounced its wild ambition to  keep hold on South Korea as an advanced base of the Far East and  that it is using the nuclear problem as a means to isolate and  crush our Republic.    The danger of war is growing momentarily on the Korean  peninsula because of the reckless military threat and war  provocation maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppet clique [choson pandoesonun chonjaengui wihomi sisi  kakkakuro kogago issomnida].    Today, at a time when our nation, which has been forced by  outside forces to endure the sufferings of division for half a  century, is faced with even the danger of suffering the  holocaust of nuclear war. We can never look at this grave  situation with folded arms. Although they are frantically  running wild to isolate and suffocate our Republic and crush our  socialism under the pretext of the nuclear problem, the U.S.  imperialists and international reactionaries cannot frighten our  people with any pressure, threat, or blackmail, and no  high-handedness or pressure can fool us. As recognized by the  world, our people do not like to engage in empty talk. They are  a resolute people [kyoltansong innun inmin] who will do what  they say they will and will not do anything when they say they  will not. Responding to dialogue with dialogue and to war with  war is our firm position. [applause]    Our people who treasure the nation's independence and the  country's peace do not want war, but we will not beg for peace  even if our sovereign rights are infringed upon. Pursuing  aggression and war under the pretext of peace is the  imperialists' conventional means. All situations taking place  today on the Korean peninsula and the international arena show  that the imperialists' aggressive and plunderous nature will not  change at all and that we must not have any kind of fantasy  about imperialism.    The officers and men of the People's Army and the People's  Security Forces and members of the Red Worker-Peasant Militia  and Red Youth Guards must be firmly armed with the  chuche-oriented point of view on war, observe with vigilance the  moves of the enemies, and assume a full combat readiness to  destroy in a single blow whenever and wherever the enemies  attack. [applause]    If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula where U.S.  nuclear weapons are concentratedly deployed, it will easily draw  the world into the ravages of a thermonuclear war. Then, man  will suffer an irrecoverable wretched calamity. The United  States and the South Korean authorities must contemplate over  the grave consequences this reckless act will bring about and  act with discretion. The Japanese reactionary class must  correctly look at the trend of the times and must not commit a  rash and thoughtless action.    If the U.S. imperialists and their following forces kindle  the flames of a war on Korea to the very end, running counter to  the trend of the times, our people and the People's Army will  fight to the end for the party and the leader and for our  socialist fatherland obtained through blood, to thoroughly  annihilate and sweep away the aggressors and once again manifest  the spirit of the heroic Korea. [applause]    Today's situation is presenting a very grave problem before  our 70 million people of whether to open the road for the  fatherland's reunification through great national unity, or  become a victim of the big powers by carrying out hostility and  confrontation between the fellow countrymen. Our nation must  move toward the road of reunifying the fatherland through great  national unity. Great national unity must be achieved to break  the current deadlock, defend the nation's dignity and sovereign  rights, and open the road for the fatherland's independent and  peaceful reunification. All the fellow Korean countrymen of the  North, South, and overseas must unite as one under the banner of  the 10-point program of great national unity for the  fatherland's reunification to carry out a nation-wide struggle.  Therefore, we will realize the cause of the fatherland's  reunification without fail. [applause]    Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is an  honorable and sacred struggle for the fatherland's prosperity  and man's bright future. Voices of the world's revolutionary  people supporting the socialist cause and our people's struggle  for the fatherland's reunification are being raised with each  passing day, and our revolution's international solidarity is  being all the more strengthened. Amid the active support and  encouragement of the world's progressive people, there is no  power in this world that can obstruct our people's advance  fighting for the just cause of the leadership of the great  leader and the great party. We will also be always victorious.  [applause]    Let us all single-heartedly unite around the party Central  Committee accompanied by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim  Il-song to all the more vigorously fight in realizing the cause  of the fatherland's reunification and completing the chuche  revolutionary cause. [applause]    Hurrah for Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our  party  and people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause]    Hurrah for the glorious WPK, the organizer and leader  [hyangdoja] of all victories of the Korean people! [shouts of  hurrahs and applause]    Let there be victory and glory for the officers and men of  the heroic KPA. [applause]     "

O free brother citizens in the brave city of Aden. Your Armed  Forces, who are defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy,  are advancing, with firmness and faithfulness, to pound at the  fortifications of the forces of apostasy and secession and to  save brave, steadfast Aden from the remnant soldiers of treason,  terrorism, and agentry, so beloved Aden can return to the  smiling face of the one united Yemen and resume its appropriate  position as the trade and economic capital of the Republic of  Yemen, in which goodness, security, peace, and stability will  prevail under the banner of unity, democracy, and Constitutional  legitimacy.    O free brother citizens in the brave city of Aden: Your  national, unionist leadership under the zealous national leader,  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces,  is very concerned about the security and peace of all the sons  of the homeland, particularly the citizens in brave, lofty Aden.  They are waiting with patience for the moment of great salvation  at the hands of the forces of unity and Constitutional  legitimacy. These brave lofty forces continued their sacred  march toward brave Aden to save it from the pros of terrorism,  crime, and bloody liquidation, the forces of apostasy and  secession.    This is the last chance for all those who are misled by the  forces of apostasy and secession to join the ranks of their  brothers defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy, to  declare their loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, and  unity, and to step with all bravery and courage on the stupidity  of the forces of apostasy and secession. These forces, who are  taking their last gasp, want to set Aden on fire and destroy it,  as an expression of their grudge, stupidity, cowardice, and  meanness.    The danger facing our people in brave Aden comes from the  professionals of terrorism, crime, and destruction, the gang of  apostasy and secession, not from their unionist Armed Forces,  who are defending the dignity, life, stability, and security of  the people, protecting their unity, safeguarding Constitutional  legitimacy, and preserving blood, money, honor, and property  from the danger of the forces of apostasy and secessions, who  are using the bodies of our men, women, old men, and children in  the brave and heroic city of Aden -- through force, coercion,  threats, and violence -- as a human shield to protect  themselves, now that they have lost all their losing cards and  grown afraid of their future. They have only this rancorous,  barbaric, terrorist method that shows their disregard for the  lives of innocent people and their thirst to shed more chaste  blood, thereby recording a new chapter in their bloody  ill-omened history, which is already full of tragedies,  massacres, and bloody liquidation in which tens of thousands of  our innocent people were killed.    The forces of apostasy and secession know full well that  the moment of the fall of their criminal and terrorist scheme is  approaching and that the inevitable downfall of the symbols of  apostasy and secession in the quagmire of treason and crime is  imminent. Therefore, these forces will not hesitate to commit  rancorous acts of revenge while they are dying.    Hence, the sons of our people, particularly our free,  faithful brothers in brave Aden, must be fully alert and  vigilant to foil the last chapters of the treasonous and  secessionist conspiracy. They must be fully confident that the  forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy are very concerned  about the citizens' life, property, security, and stability. In  fact, this concern is greater than their concern about the lives  of their brave soldiers, equipment, and weapons. They are the  forces of the people who protect the people, their achievements,  security, stability, and Constitutional legitimacy. These  forces are for the people, not for an individual party, faction,  or separatist clique to protect their individual narrow  interests. They are the forces of revolution, unity, and  democracy which only aim their guns at traitors, rebels against  Constitutional legitimacy, and violators of people's options.    Therefore, the sons of our honest and unionist people in  brave Aden need to be aware of this important fact and to be  very confident and reassured that their brothers, the sons of  the Armed Forces -- the forces of unity, Constitutional  legitimacy, and democracy -- endeavor, with all honesty, love,  faithfulness, and concern, to save them from the tyranny of the  terror traitors, the advocates of apostasy, separation, agentry,  and treason. All honest civilians and military in brave,  unionist Aden should join the ranks of unity and Constitutional  legitimacy with all faithfulness, bravery, courage, and heroism  in order to write, together with their courageous brothers in  the Yemeni Armed Forces -- the forces of unity and  Constitutional legitimacy -- the chapter of freedom from the  nightmare of the forces of apostasy, separation, terrorism, and  treason, and to champion the will of their lofty, faithful, and  great people. Victory comes only from God.     "

These acts will not cease as long as the negotiating process  does not achieve practical results on the ground. The Oslo  accord set 13 April as the date for ending the occupation in  Gaza and Jericho as the first step toward beginning talks over a  final settlement. Evidence and facts indicate, however, that  this date will pass without the realization of a practical  achievement. Consequently, the cycle of violence will remain  and bloodshed will continue. This is something which we do not  desire, but condemnation and precautionary measures are  insufficient and will not stop acts of violence. The only way  to do that is by advancing in the negotiating process and  understanding the facts of the struggle. Delay in reaching  agreements on implementing the accord will leave the door open  for mutual acts of violence that we have always hoped will stop.    Israel is called upon to seriously accelerate the  negotiating  process, adhere to what it signed in Washington and Cairo,  refrain from engaging in procedural matters, and move toward the  achievement of practical steps leading to peace and stability,  so that calm will prevail and violence will end forever.    We strongly condemn acts of violence regardless of the party  that perpetrates them and look forward to the moment in which  the foundations of peace and stability are laid down.     "
0,FT931-1516 ,"FT931-1516 _AN-DCYCKAGUFT 930324   FT  24 MAR 93 / UN airlift for wounded Moslems: UK and French helicopters to head for Srebrenica in key test for Serbs      By ROBERT MAUTHNER, LAURA SILBER and REUTER      LONDON, BELGRADE, VIENNA   UNITED Nations officials intend to launch a helicopter shuttle service today to cross eastern Bosnia's battle lines and rescue wounded in the besieged Moslem enclave of Srebrenica. The operation is to be a test of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's promise in New York to open a corridor to provide an escape for tens of thousands of Moslems being pushed before advancing Bosnian Serbs. Major Pepe Gallegos of the UN protection force said the operation would be carried out by British and French helicopters. Earlier, General Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander in Bosnia, turned his wrath on to the Bosnian Moslems, after his heroic action to relieve the besieged Moslem population of Srebrenica last week. In a show of impartiality in keeping with his senior position in the UN's peace-keeping operations in Bosnia, Gen Morillon accused the Moslem authorities in the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla of bad faith in preventing the evacuation of Serbs. The general, who has been subject to some criticism from his military and political superiors for allegedly behaving as 'a loose cannon', had asked Mr Ejup Ganic, the Moslem Bosnian vice-president, to intervene in Tuzla, where local government officials had gone back on a promise to let some Serbs leave. 'I consider, at the present time, that their bad will is blocking the whole peace process,' the general told reporters in the Serbian border town of Mali Zvornik. 'I am only asking for the respect of the Geneva Convention.' The UN commander said he would probably be obliged to go to Tuzla, probably today, to sort things out. Bosnian Serb leaders in the area have insisted that some 240 of their compatriots should be allowed to leave Tuzla if aid convoys to Moslems cut off in other towns and villages are to be permitted to move. An aid convoy and a French field hospital attempting to reach Srebrenica remained blocked yesterday, while trucks heading for the Moslem town of Zepa were ordered to return by the UN, after having been held up by Serb militiamen for nearly a week. The local Serb military commanders were pursuing their obstructive tactics in spite of the announcement by Mr Karadzic that he had given his agreement in principle for an air corridor to be opened between Srebrenica and Tuzla. The aid airlift is to be provided by French and British helicopters, which would make as many as six flights a day. The Bosnian Serb news agency said the corridor would be open for five days, but that this could be extended. The difficulties on the ground in Bosnia occurred as the Bosnian Serb leaders ordered a 'general mobilisation' in reply to the planned vote by the UN security council to adopt a res-olution enforcing the no-fly ban over Bosnia, first imposed last November. Though international observers have been under the impression that most able-bodied Bosnian Serbs are already fighting in the civil war against the Moslems, the call-up order was intended to signal to the world that the Serbs would not take the ban lying down. Some diplomats feared that the UN resolution, while having little practical effect on the war, would further hamper the peace negotiations in New York, where there has not been a face-to-face meeting between the Bosnian Serb and Moslem leaders for weeks. Officials close to the talks said that the Moslem Bosnian president, Mr Alijah Izetbegovic, was closer to signing the map on the division of the country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces than Mr Karadzic. But there was still a long way to go before either of them would be ready to conclude a peace settlement. Austria, already host to 60,000 refugees from Bosnia, will no longer accept asylum-seekers from the region, according to Mr Franz Loeschnak, the interior minister, Reuter reports from Vienna. He was speaking after a meeting in Klagenfurt, southern Austria, with Mr Ivo Bizjak, his Slovenian counterpart. 'I cannot perceive Austria accepting any more refugees in the near future,' Mr Loeschnak said. He added it was now up to other European countries to accept their full share of refugees from former Yugoslavia. 'One part of Europe acts as if the consequences of the war in the Balkans only affected the directly bordering states,' Mr Loeschnak said. He singled out Britain for criticism in the refugee question. He said that despite Austrian requests, London had granted entry to only 30 Bosnians out of 120 heading for Britain, who were stranded for days in freezing weather at the Austrian border because of Britain's refusal to grant visas. The refugees, including women and children, had been cared for by Austrians who took them into their homes until permanent accommodation was found for them. Of the 60,000 refugees taken in by Austria, 46,000 are in the care of state institutions. The remaining 14,000 are staying mainly with relatives or friends. Mr Bizjak too said his small country's capacity to take in more refugees was almost exhausted.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.     ATZ  Austria, West Europe.

During their flights,  these planes dropped provocative and hostile leaflets promoting  instigation against Iraq.    The foreign minister added: While condemning these  aggressive and provocative acts, we hold the Saudi and Kuwaiti  rulers fully responsible for their participation in acts of  aggression against Iraq, for the extensive material losses these  acts cause, and also for the security, economic, political, and  moral threats they pose to Iraq and the Iraqi people.

The stands were clear: Al-Asad, who called for the peace of  the brave, was not and will never be like 'Arafat who distorted  this slogan and turned it into a capitulatory slogan for the  defeatists. Al-Asad, who was the first to raise this slogan,  wants it to be clear and frank. He wants peace to be based on  achieving justice and restoring rights. The U.S. officials, who  dreamed of achieving something from this meeting in the interest  of the Zionist entity, did not hide this fact when they conveyed  Clinton's impressions about President al-Asad's steady and firm  stand on issues considered by Damascus to be among its top  priorities and commitments. At the top of these commitments is  the fact that the Palestinian vanguards, which found shelter,  sympathy, and care in Syria are militant and liberation  vanguards that seek to achieve their Palestinian people's  freedom and to see dawn on their usurped lands.    Thus, Arab Damascus refutes American and Zionist allegations  that the Palestinian liberation factions are terrorist  organizations that undermine peace. Clinton said at his news  conference that differences with Syria lie in different fields,  including the presence of certain groups, such as the Jibril  group [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General  Command], as he said in his statement. This reaffirms our  Palestinian people's confidence in al-Asad's Syria, which forced  Clinton to publicly annul the label of terrorists with which the  vanguards of our people were described and to acknowledge the  firmness of the Syrian stand.    Therefore, the expectations of some observers have been  reiterated; namely, the clear and firm Syrian stand will not be  changed by all that has been connoted by Zionism and all that it  has planted in the mind of the U.S. Administration in order to  keep the United States a tool in its hand.    The al-Asad-Clinton summit very ably disproved the picture  drawn before the U.S. President by the stands of capitulation  and shame adopted by some defeatists and surrenderers who,  falsely, claim the representation of our heroic people. Those  defeatists and surrenderers panted in Washington just to put  their hands in the hand of terrorist Rabin and to sign the  accord of treason with him at the expense of their people's  objectives and aspirations.    Greetings of appreciation and pride from our Palestinian  people to the stand of brotherhood, fraternity, struggle, and  determination to achieve justice advocated by al-Asad's Syria  from the beginning of our people's cause when 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam led our people's strugglers, until he was martyred in  Ya'bad's jungles, and when Sa'id al-'As carried out his heroic  acts, until the full liberation is achieved, God willing.

0,FT923-8843 ,"FT923-8843 _AN-CHLBKACRFT 920808   FT  08 AUG 92 / A rather nasty British disease: Pride in one's country is fine. Jingoism is something else      By DOMINIC LAWSON   I HAVE spent most of the past week in Morocco. It was difficult to sleep, but I blame neither the heat nor the flies. I blame the Olympic Games. On the first day Khalid Skah, of Morocco, won the men's 10,000 metres race. All night there was a strange chanting, which I took to be a celebration. The next day Skah was disqualified, for reasons which were not altogether appreciated by the man in the casbah. So the quiet of the night was this time rent by peculiar ululations which I took to be the Arabic for 'we wuz robbed.' Then, on the third day, Khalid Skah rose from the dead. His disqualification was revoked. There followed another night of howling, this time accompanied by the beating of distant drums. In England, of course, we are above such primitive and pointless patriotism. We are above it because the newspapers and television do it for us, beating the drums which resonate in every home in the land. On my first day back in England, I turned to the BBC to watch what purported to be the highlights of that day's events in Barcelona. Virtually the entire programme was given over to an interview of stupifying banality with Sally Gunnell, the British winner of the women's 400m hurdles. The race was shown - I might have lost count - four times, once accompanied by music, giving it the full Chariots of Fire treatment. How much I would have preferred it if the BBC had delivered one programme of genuine highlights of the Olympics and then, for those of a more Moroccan disposition, a late-night programme consisting of Sally Gunnell's race replayed endlessly against a soundtrack of Land of Hope and Glory, God Save the Queen, I Vow to Thee My Country, Rule Britannia, and other suitable anthems. The following day, British runner Kriss Akabusi won the bronze medal in the men's 400m. This was an interesting piece of news for sports fans, but I cannot be alone in finding it odd that the BBC commentator noticed this fact before realising that the winner of the race, the American, Kevin Young, had broken the world record. I don't suppose the British media are biased uniquely in this respect. I am even prepared to believe that every country has an equally absurd concentration on its own athletes' performances, all ignoring completely the real pattern of success, achievement and failure at the Barcelona Games. Doubtless, we would laugh if we were able to tune into the television of a small African country and watch countless repeats of its man coming third in the steeplechase. But I find the British version of this disease upsetting, because it seems to me characteristic of a small or inconsequential country so starved of success that it exaggerates wildly and overplays even the most minor triumphs. In Britain's case, this minor state nationalism has been accompanied by an increasingly boorish attitude to opponents. There was a time when visiting foreign football teams were applauded at Wembley, partly out of courtesy. Nowadays, if a visiting team crushed England, as the Hungarians did in the 1950s, rather than simply marvel at the skill of the foreigners the UK press would demand that the English manager be sacked, as if anything less than perpetual victory was a national insult. The biggest danger is that Britons somehow take sporting success as symbolic, or even proof, of some great national virility - as, in our case, a triumph of Englishness over foreignness. The old communist regimes of eastern Europe understood the propaganda value of this very well. One reason why we in the west believed all the nonsense about the 'showpiece' East German economy was because we found it hard to imagine that a nation which could produce so much success on the sports track could be, at the same time, decadent, corrupt and redundant. There is nothing wrong at all with patriotism. Pride in one's country is an admirable sentiment and is often the well-spring of heroic acts of altruism, particularly in times of war. But the achievement of a plain Essex girl in leaping over hurdles at unbeatable pace tells us nothing about ourselves and nothing about our country. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.

The statement welcomes ""the joining of the army by the  honorable brothers Staff Brigadier General Salim al-Hajjaji,  Major Ahmad al-Fituri, and Captain Anwar Abu-Ghaliyah, who have  joined the army,"" hoping that their position will be ""a blessed  start for this new phase in the march of Libyan national  struggle.""

The source said these claims  were totally untrue. They were the product of the delusory  imaginings of the military gang of the [word indistinct]  al-Ahmar gang, who had succeeded in feeding these false reports  to obfuscate the great defeats inflicted on their forces in  Abyan, Qa'tabah, Radfan, and Kirsh. The source said that the  remnants of the Amaliqah forces, which had claimed to have been  on the outskirts of Aden, are now scattered on the al-Arqub  after our heroic armed forces destroyed their main strongholds  in Zinjibar and Ja'ar. At dawn today our forces succeeded in  destroying the camp of the Amaliqah at Zinjibar completely,  burning all stores, supplies, and ammunition. They destroyed a  major portion of the Amaliqah vehicles and then pursued the  remnants of the force, which fled in the direction of al-Arqub.    The forces of the 30th Brigade, now deployed in their new  positions along the Lawdar-Mukayras axis, were able to join up  with the 20th Brigade in Mukayras this morning.    As for the military situation in Lahij, the 2d Armored  Brigade, which had been loyal to the bloody and oppressive  al-Ahmar gang, was successfully destroyed. The camp at Lahij  was captured. Many officers and other ranks were taken  prisoner, and some tanks and military vehicles were captured.  Most of them had been destroyed during the fighting in al-Rahah  in Radfan over the past few days. The defeat of the 2d Armored  Brigade made it possible to open the road between al-Dali and  Aden, and for our armed forces stationed at Radfan and al-Anad  to join up with the Abbud Brigade at al-Dali. The latter was  provided with supplies after it firmly withstood, with  exceptional heroism, an attack mounted on it by three brigades  from the al-Hamzah Camp, central security forces, and Republican  Guards from the Qa'tabah-ibb axis, in the heroic town of  al-Dali. The inhabitants of al-Dali had been subjected to a  mindless and indiscriminate artillery bombardment which lasted  an hour a day over three successive days.    The ground battles resulted in the destruction of tens of  tanks belonging to the security three force -- loyal to the  bloody al- Ahmar gang -- which attacked the town of al-Dali, but  their tanks and military vehicles were overcome and are lying on  the battlefield. The steadfast forces of the Abbud Brigade were  able to capture the positions of the attacking forces in the  [word indistinct] area of the town of Qa'tabah. The battles on  the al- Dali and Radfan fronts resulted in the failure of an  attack mounted by the 3d Brigade, from their positions in the  town of Taiizz, toward Kirsh. The attacking tank squadron was  destroyed, and many officers and other ranks were captured with  their arms and equipment by the (Dabuzah) Brigade, which is  deployed at Kirsh.     "

Carol Sobieski's screenplay, adapted from the carefully wrought novel of North  Carolina regional novelist John Ehle, sets a father and young daughter from  more citified Pennsylvania down in the middle of an isolated Smoky Mountains  community, mid-Depression time. Wayland Jackson (Kurt Russell) is a decent,  gentle, humorous man with patience enough to make clocks, which happens to be  his trade. Recently widowered and only now coming out of it, he is the devoted  father to a ferocious, outspoken 10-year old daughter, Paula (splendid newcomer  Amelia Burnette).    When their car gets stuck in a country stream, father and daughter stumble down  through misty woods onto a remote mountain compound belonging to Collie Wright  (Kelly McGillis) a notably suspicious woman, and her beautiful, 6-month-old  son, Jonathan.    Collie, it seems, is a pridefully unmarried mother, although she has kept the  father's identity secret. (It doesn't take vast detective work to ferret out  the man however; if you remember the Hatfields and the McCoys or Romeo and  Juliet you might have a clue.)    Having this baby has alienated Collie from her mother, but not her patriarchal  father (Lloyd Bridges) or her three brothers: the weak, guilt-ridden  storekeeper Gudger (Lanny Flaherty), stocky blacksmith Milton (David Dwyer), or  Young (Don Michael Paul), obviously the youngest, a handsome, traveling,  all-purpose hell-raiser.    Almost instantly, Jackson and Paula are taken up by the lonely Collie, although  the specter of the baby's father, who may return at any moment, hangs over  their growing involvement. Jackson, whom Collie quarters in an out-building, is  introduced to this close-knit mountain community and even persuades the Wright  clan to back the building of an enormous clock tower in the center of town.    Sobieski's dialogue is respectful of Ehle's beautifully written North Carolina  talk, expanding it at times inventively. But, excepting nicely played scenes  between Jackson, Collie and Paula, the tone that director Ted Kotcheff has set  begins to seems ludicrous.    Don Michael Paul has been encouraged to play the lusty Young like every amateur  auditioning for the role of the Rainmaker in a bus-and-truck touring company.  The baby's father looks and acts like a slathering, backwoods Rasputin. It  makes it impossible to imagine Collie with him more than once, and theirs was  supposed to be a love affair that went on for more than two years. The  suspicion rises that this off-beat property may be condemned.    It's a feeling that gets stronger with our first introduction to the Campbell  clan, rivals to the Wrights and headed by elder Drury Campbell (Mitchell Ryan).  They're first seen robbing and vandalizing the Jackson's stranded car like a  pack of howling, bearded degenerates. Granted that these hunters and trappers  are nearly barbaric in the novel; they still cannot be played like the North  Carolina branch of Faulkner's vicious, inbred Snopes family, or the film and  its relationships are in deep trouble.    Ehle has written with the utmost precision, neatly delineating country people  and their beautiful, oppressive surroundings with loving attention. It's  important that the Campbell and Wright patriarchs be imposing, nuanced figures.  Kotcheff slurps effects onto his canvas with strokes broad enough to cover a  barn.    And what, in heaven's name, attracted Kurt Russell to a role where he could be  upstaged by a 10-year-old, by an imitation Rainmaker or by a raving backwoods  madman?)    The melodrama does plays itself out with an uncommon number of unexpected  twists. However, Collie's extraordinary decision near the close of the story  snaps what credulity we may still be hanging onto. It's an essentially literary  device that may hold up better on a page than on a screen. Or better on any  page than on this screen.    Collie's action is like an inversion of the famous Faulkner story in ""Knight's  Gambit,"" which became the poignant film ""Tomorrow"" and may -- still -- contain  one of Robert Duvall's greatest performances. It centers around a lovingly  raised child taken over by a brutish, vicious family. Because of the way the  Campbells have been drawn here, Collie's act, difficult enough to understand  under any circumstances, becomes absolutely unthinkable.    Finally, in a last indignity, the film makers graft a  sunshine-through-the-tears ending onto Ehle's stoic, entirely fitting  conclusion, a horse-trading session between the patriarchs which conveys  continuity, birthright and dynasty. (Writer Sobieski cannot be entirely removed  from responsibility here, since she was also the supervising producer, under  the principal producer, Robert Solo.)    ""The Winter People"" (rated PG-13 for some of its brutality and rough language)  is nevertheless a handsomely realized production. Its production designer Ron  Foreman has made details like Gudger's store realistic but never quaint; the  work of cinematographer Francois Protat (""The Hitchhiker,"" ""Joshua Then and  Now"") is exquisite and subdued without calling attention it itself, as is the  succinct work of editor Thom Noble.    And given the improbable demands of her part, McGillis makes a heroic Collie,  although the notion of her wild unbridled passion for the baby's ruttish father  seems to fall a little short of, say, Cathy's for Heathcliff. For my money, the  movie's most intriguing performance is by the young, matter-of-fact Amelia  Burnette who, in the freezing cold, manages lines like ""I can't move my  fingers"" without a hint of whining.

A responsible military source at the Defense Ministry and the  General Staff Command has stated the following:    For the fourth day, the heroes of our valiant Armed Forces,  the forces of the people, unity, and Constitutional legitimacy,  and protectors of democracy, have continued their splendid  victories in all fields of confrontation with the forces of evil  and rebellion against legitimacy and disavowal of the people and  unity. They draw success from God, supporter of the brave  soldiers who are loyal to their people, homeland, and unity.    At 1300 yesterday, the 2d Armored Brigade managed to advance  and join the al-'Amaliqah Brigade to form a heroic combat bridge  toward the attainment of the main objectives in the last chapter  of the battle for unity and democracy. They are now confidently  advancing, supported by the 13th and 56th Brigades and the  al-Wahdah Brigades in the direction of Aden Governorate. They  are confronting the desperate and defeatist remnants of the  secessionist gang forces.    These forces are currently waging brave battles in the  al-'Alam area, 20 km from the beloved economic and commercial  capital, Aden, approaching the last dens of the gang of plotting  and secession in the Socialist Party leadership.    These forces managed to besiege the misguided elements of  the  Shamsan Brigade. A large number of the brigade's officers and  soldiers surrendered and their weapons, equipment, and vehicles  were captured.    In the Lahij Governorate, the 6th al-Wahdah [Unity] Brigade  and the 2d Independent Armored Brigade waged heroic and brave  battles during which they managed to destroy the (?retreating)  units of the 'Abbud Brigade and the secessionist gang militias.  More than 40 troops and 200 militiamen surrendered and joined  the forces of unity and Constitutional legitimacy.    In Abyan Governorate, and in an effort to fortify our Armed  Forces in this patient, glorious governorate, the heroic  al-Wahdah Brigades -- infantry, artillery, and armor -- managed  to destroy the 30th Brigade, which was recently moved from  al-Maharrah Governorate to besiege and attack the al-'Amaliqah  forces. Thus, this brigade met the dark destiny to which it was  pushed by the gang of rebellion and secession. All of its  commanders, officers, and soldiers surrendered to the forces of  legitimacy and the Constitution, the protectors of democracy.  All weapons, equipment, and vehicles, which are kept by the  elements of that rebelling gang for plotting in the Abyan  Governorate, were captured.    Our Armed Forces in the southwestern axis of the 3d Infantry  Brigade and units from the Khalid Camp and the Reserve Brigade  continued to carry out their fixed missions and achieve  successive victories while continuing their advance toward the  al-'Anad Camp and the capital of Lahij Governorate.    While these decisive battles are positively progressing,  the Air Force within our valiant Armed Forces assumed a heroic,  unique, and brave commando role in confronting the attackers'  aircraft and completing the missions and targets they had been  assigned on all battlefronts with high efficiency. They carried  out more than 20 air sorties, fulfilling their objectives with  complete success.    The following are among the most important military tasks  they successfully carried out: Destroying the runways and  facilities of the al-'Anad airport, destroying and sinking a  missile gunboat which tried to shell our armed forces in Abyan  Governorate, destroying large quantities of the military  hardware of the 30th Infantry Brigade while it was advancing to  (Lubyan) Directorate in Abyan Governorate. They also succeeded  in hitting and destroying the Aden airport runway so the rebel  secessionist clique will not be able to use it to pursue the  aggression against our Armed Forces, or to escape outside the  country.    While the comprehensive bloody war that was arranged by the  rebel and secessionist forces is nearing its end, their rancor  excacerbates and their bloody and terrorist actions intensify.  The secessionist gang fired missiles on populated areas in  al-Rahibah, Ta'izz Governorate, and al-Mukha, targetting the  power plant, and against Al-Hudaydah, targetting the power plant  in the Ra's Kabir area. Many defenseless citizens were  martyred, although these missiles failed to destroy the vital  installations they had as targets. The rancorous will swallow  their rancor.    Within the unique and brave operations that the forces of  unity and legitimacy have carried out, our air defense forces  confronted with great ability the enemy aircraft on all fronts,  downing one aircraft over Abyan, another over Ka'kaba, and a  third over Ta'izz Governorate.    The military source concluded his statement by saying: There  is no need today to rebutt the media falsehoods and lies by the  defeatist secessionist forces of the YSP command because their  lies speak for themselves and are refuted by the stable security  state of affairs in all cities, where the rancorous have tried  to ignite the sedition, to destroy, and harm their citizens.    The source praised the confidence all the sons of the Yemeni  people have demonstrated toward the victories their Armed Forces  and Public Security Forces are scoring, their pride in them, and  their waiting for the important victory over all the forces of  oppression, apostasy, and secession so that the new history of  our people and country will put an end to the last page of their  rancorous and desperate conspiracy in spite of the military  hardare and lethal weapons the rancorous and conspirators had  prepared and which they purchased with money that was to be used  to feed the people and at the expense of the people's  development aspitations for progress and construction. They now  are receiving the just punishment. History has discarded them,  away from our people's lives, so they may not sully their  unionist and democractic march and so that they may not tarnish  the ray of hope in all the hearts of the Yemenis. Fighting is  prescribed for you, and you dislike it. But it is possible that  you dislike a thing which is good for you. [Koranic verse]     "

At the outset, the brother supreme commander of the Armed  Forces congratulated brother struggler Brig. Gen. 'Abd-Rabbuh  Mansur on his appointment as defense minister of the Republic of  Yemen. He stressed his confidence in the competence and  capability of the brother, struggler, hero defense minister, in  commanding the Armed Forces of the Republic of Yemen and  consolidating its heroic role in defending the unity of the  Yemeni homeland and crushing the remnants of apostasy and  secession -- those who have sold their conscience, lost the  honor of belonging to their homeland, and been carried away  behind their evil whims and ambitions, not caring about the  consequences of their acts, namely, sabotaging the homeland,  depleting its forces, and destroying its resources, which were  built by the sweat of the masses.    The brother chairman urged the commanders of military units  and the personnel of the Defense Ministry Command and the  General Staff Command to cooperate with the Defense Ministry and  implement its orders, which aim at enhancing the heroic  abilities of our Armed Forces -- the forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy -- which are continuing to achieve  successive victories, repulsing heroically and crushingly the  remnants of apostasy, secession, and rebellion against  legitimacy.    The brother chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces paid tribute to the efficiency and heroic, splendid  performance of the noncommissioned officers, officers, and  troops of our Armed Forces on all axes of fighting and national  struggle in defense of the unity of the homeland and its pure  soil.    The brother chairman and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces pointed out the importance of coordinating efforts in an  integral way with the agencies of the Interior Ministry. This  is meant to enable these agencies to carry out their effective  national role in maintaining the security and safety of the  citizens, safeguarding public funds and property, and  confronting any phenomena that seek to infringe on the citizen's  safety and funds and any attempt to create disorder. He also  urged these agencies to strike with an iron fist at any party  that tries to tamper with the security of the homeland and to  maintain the community's safety.    The brother struggler, Brig. Gen. 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur, the  defense minister, thanked and appreciated the precious  confidence of brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of  the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, asserting his faith in God and in the ability of the  heroes of our Armed Forces to achieve the hopes pinned on them  by their people in defending the unity of the homeland and  defeating all the attempts of the gang of apostasy and secession  and its schemes that aim at fragmenting and destroying the  homeland. He stressed that our valiant Armed Forces will always  remain the sword in the hand of the people and its  constitutional institutions in the face of any party that  tampers with the security and achievements of the homeland,  primarily, unity and democracy.

0,FT922-4076 ,"FT922-4076 _AN-CFHAXAA5FT 920608   FT  08 JUN 92 / Arts: Mario and the Magician - Opera      By ANDREW PORTER   Janos Vajda's and the late Stephen Oliver's versions of Mario and the Magician (both 1988) were one-act operas; the first was given in a double-bill with Dido, the other with Offenbach's Ba-ta-clan. Harry Somers's Mario and the Magician, which had its premiere in Toronto last week, is in three acts and lasts three hours. The Canadian Opera Company maintains a steady output of new Canadian operas, but Mario was its first 'mainstage' premiere in 18 years - preceded by Charles Wilson's Heloise and Abelard in 1973, and Somers's own Louis Riel in 1967. It was a success: warmly acclaimed by the public, brilliantly performed by the company. Canadian Opera, with Brian Dickie as general manager and Richard Bradshaw as music director, is flourishing. Thirty-five of the 36 singers in Mario, most of them young, came from the company, and were there space enough all would be named and praised, for there was a vivacity and precision in the performance that held eye and ear. Among the prominent were Theodore Baerg (Mann, renamed Stefan), Marcia Swanston (his wife), Andre Clouthier (the chief heckler), Heather Thompson, Cornelis Opthof, Benoit Boutet (Mario), and the treble Patrick Torcat. But wherever the eye fell, it fell upon performers alert in response and reaction; and the orchestra of 26 (woodwind and brass quartets, saxophone, harp, piano, percussion, and strings), conducted by Bradshaw, played with a like animation. Robert Carsen, the producer, combined dynamic stage pictures, ingeniously and economically devised, with attentive inspiration of each individual character. The work itself? Shadowed, for me, by Britten's Death in Venice; I'm still under the impact of Covent Garden's recent production, and Philip Langridge's Aschenbach. In Mann's Mario und der Zauberer, the Aschenbach/Mann of Der Tod in Venedig is developed and split into two separate characters - the German narrator, striving to keep Apollonian detachment, and the Magician, Cipolla, shamelessly flaunting his Dionysian powers and at last bringing the boy into his arms and onto his lips. Der Zauberer - the hypnotic manipulator of words to bring people to his way of thinking - was Mann's family nickname. But there are also what Mann called 'minor political highlights and topical allusions tucked away' in the successor tale - the grotesque but potent Cipolla as a Mussolini hypnotising decent Italians into indecent behaviour. But 'I should prefer to see its significance in the realm of ethics rather than politics,' Mann said. In Somers's opera the minor political allusions were not tucked away but dominant: a portrait of Il Duce hung on the back wall, replaced at the close by one of Der Fuhrer; Giovinezza, the now-banned Fascist anthem, was the first-act finale. (It is a fiendishly catchy tune; during the interval people could be heard happily humming it.) Carsen, on a stage bared to a blackened back wall, and with almost all his characters black-clad (even on the beach), displayed not a smiling, seductive Italy menaced but one already blightened, blackened, and bellicose; blackshirted, jackbooted squadristi were prominent supers. The fabulous, enduringly apposite qualities of the novella were diminished to an historical episode - an effect emphasised by the framing of the tale within a 1919 Munich lecture on the menace of totalitarianism. Acts 2 and 3, played without an interval, were Cipolla's show. Rod Anderson, the librettist, left nothing out (as Vajda and Oliver did), conscientiously underlined and expanded what was there, and added more of his own. This was a protracted music-theatre account of Mann's novella. But one that was gripping, for Somers is an able, efficient, and experienced composer. His manner varied from neoclassical Stravinskian scherzo (complex only on the page and for the performers, with its ever-changing metres) to Britten-type - but not Britten-great  - lyricism. There was free-range harmony, often with parallel fourths beneath figuration. The score was not boring. The opera was done not in Toronto's 3200-seat O'Keefe barn but in the company's other house, the 1500-seat Elgin, where operas can tell. (Its bright, intimate acoustics allowed some of Somers's exuberant brass writing to drown the words.) Cipolla's audience, until he summoned them to the stage, was seated in and sang from open boxes rather like those in the Edinburgh King's. As the Magician, the American tenor David Rampy gave a terrific performance. It is a role that calls for a Jon Vickers. Rampy has a heavy, clumsy, powerful voice - a potent character-tenor without beauty but on an heroic scale - and a presence and utterance that from his first, insolent entrance until the melodramatic finale nearly two hours later, held spellbound both his figured and the real audience.

The report did not absolve the government of responsibility  for the spread of religious extremism and fanaticism, however,  but noted that the state institutions and state-controlled media  were ""retreating"" in the face of the pressures brought to bear  by the ""political Islamic tendency.""    EOHR said it ""followed with extreme concern the escalating  terrorist activity and the acts of violence carried out by some  armed groups of the political Islamic tendency which  constituted, in 1993, an unprecedented violation of a  fundamental human right, which is the right to live.""    Statistics compiled by the EOHR indicate that ""the harvest  of  bloody violence"" in 1993 included the death of at least 207  people, more than the total for the previous three years during  the course of which 139 people were killed in acts of violence.    The statistics show that these Islamist groups ""bear the  major part of responsibility for all acts of violence in the  country, although they had shared this responsibility with the  police forces in 1992,"" EOHR said. In 1992, Islamist groups  killed 39 people while 38 others were killed by police fire.    In 1993, however, Islamist groups were responsible for the  death of 137 people including 90 policemen, 39 innocent  civilians, 6 Christians and 2 foreign tourists. On the other  hand, 59 Islamist militants were killed either in clashes with  police or in suicide missions. Moreover, 11 citizens were  killed by police fire in the course of clashes between police  and members of militant Islamist groups.    ""EOHR, while noting that 59 police victims were killed  deliberately in acts of physical liquidation carried out by  these groups, must also note that police have desisted since  last March from acts of physical liquidation of members of these  groups,"" the report said.    It said that while 118 people were killed by Islamist  groups,  only eight members of these groups were killed by police forces  when they stormed Al-Rahmah (Mercy) mosque in Aswan last March.    The report also noted that Islamist groups have upgraded  their techniques by using explosive parcels, booby-trapped cars  and time-bombs placed in public squares and densely-populated  areas ""in order to cause the largest possible number of human  losses."" The year 1993 witnessed 12 major terrorist explosions,  including nine explosions which aimed to kill indiscriminately.    The year also witnessed a sharp escalation in assassination  plots directed at state officials, the report said, citing  abortive attempts on the lives of Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi,  Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif, and Interior Minister  Hasan al-Alfi, in addition to numerous attacks on police forces.  In the southern governorate of Asyut alone, 57 policemen were  killed. Christians and tourists also continued to be terrorist  targets, the report said.    EOHR affirmed its position that the only way to deal with  this escalation of violence is ""the peaceful and courageous  confrontation of all violations of human rights, regardless of  their source and the identity of their intended victim."" It  said a police confrontation is not enough, ""particularly in view  of the increasing retreat of the state institutions and media  before the pressures brought forth by the political Islamic  tendency, which is bound to encourage religious fanaticism and  sectarian hatred.    ""In this connection, EOHR notes that the state institutions  were giving in to the pressures exercised by Al-Azhar and the  political Islamic groups to ban numerous literary, intellectual  and enlightened works under the pretext that they are opposed to  Islam,"" the report said.    ""The organisation also notes that the state is primarily  responsible for the social phenomenon of religious extremism and  fanaticism. Educational institutes, state-owned media and  religious newspapers published by the state or the ruling party  are playing a role which is as grave as that of the newspapers  of the political Islamic tendency in preparing society to accept  and encourage religious fanaticism and sectarian hatred, curtail  freedom of expression and literary and artistic creativity,"" the  report said.

SOME LEGISLATORS SAY IT'S TIME FOR ANSWERS      By CHUCK PHILIPS      One of the most talked about moments in Madonna's acclaimed new ""Blond  Ambition"" tour is when the former Material Girl joins arm in arm with a man in  a bright yellow Dick Tracy overcoat and dances around the stage -- while a tape  of one of her songs plays.    Madonna uses a recorded version of a song from her new album because Warren  Beatty duets with her on the record -- and the actor, who plays the comic-strip  hero in the upcoming film, isn't about to go out on the road for three months.  There's no attempt to disguise the fact that Madonna's not actually singing  live on stage.    But what about the rest of her concert?    Is she really able to run around the stage with the energy of a marathon runner  without huffing and puffing at some point or missing a note?    Likewise, Janet Jackson executes some equally complicated dance steps during  her highly touted ""Rhythm Nation"" tour. Yet no matter how physically demanding  the novice performer's dancing was at the Forum in Inglewood, Jackson turned in  studio-perfect vocals on every number.    A lot of concertgoers ask themselves: Are these artists really singing? Are the  bands really playing?    What seem like simple questions lead to pop's hottest guessing game -- and a  maze of suspicions and claims, denials and doubts.    Madonna and Janet Jackson concerts aren't the only acts that have left fans  guessing in recent months. Questions have also been raised about such other  dance-oriented acts as Milli Vanilli, New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul.    Some industry insiders insist that tapes -- at least background instrumental or  vocal tapes -- are employed by some acts, but they won't publicly specify who.    ""You won't get any names out of me, but I do know for a fact that there are  groups now that do use tapes to re-create the look and sound of their videos,""  Louis Messina, owner of the Dallas-based Pace Concerts and producer of the 1989  Club MTV tour, said in a telephone interview. ""But I don't necessarily think  that it's wrong. If the audience leaves the concert fulfilled, that's what  counts.""    Representatives of Madonna, Jackson and Abdul deny their acts are using  recorded vocal tapes (except for Madonna's Dick Tracy number), though a member  of Milli Vanilli and a spokesman for New Kids on the Block admit their groups  employ tapes in some cases. The practice, they say, is simply a reflection of  the need to re-create on stage the sophisticated technology of the recording  studio.    ""Of course we work with tapes on a certain level,"" said Milli Vanilli's Rob  Pilatus in a recent interview with a Los Angeles TV station. ""But we sing live,  too. This means that on some songs -- because of the high energy -- we use the  Synclavier, but other songs we sing live.""    But some legislators in California, New York and New Jersey feel it's time for  the guessing game to end.    In May, Assemblyman Neil B. Cohen, vice-chairman of the Consumer Affairs  Committee in the New Jersey State Legislature, joined with Assemblyman Joseph  Mecca in introducing legislation requiring performers to make it clear before  concerts whether they'll sing live or lip-sync to recorded music.    ""We inferred that the current trend toward pre-recorded vocals and electronic  enhancement was to the detriment of the consumer,"" Cohen said.    California Assemblyman Bob Epple and New York Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler are  also trying to enact disclosure bills regarding recorded instrumental tracks.    ""My bill will let consumers know what to expect,"" said Epple, who plans to  introduce his bill in January. ""It will enable them to make an informed  decision as to how they want to spend their money.    Does the consumer really care whether artists perform live or use tapes? Given  the pace at which concerts sell out these days, pop music purists would be  hard-pressed to argue against automation. Truth in advertistng aside, audiences  tend to be enraptured by the picture-perfect performances that computer  technology provides. Contemporary artists are judged less on the merits of  their musical prowess than on the look of their latest video. In this regard,  proponents of tapes insist that automation does not inhibit the concert  experience, it enhances it.    Jennifer Wells, a 15-year-old New Kids on the Block fan club member from  Danville, Calif. doesn't see a problem. ""I've been to four New Kids concerts  and each performance was great,"" said Wells. ""Even if they did lip-sync a  portion of the show, it wouldn't bother me at all. They're great entertainers.""    But Musician magazine editor Bill Flanagan disagrees.    ""Someone grimacing and striking heroic poses to a pre-recorded tape is kind of  like fraud,"" Flanagan said. ""How would you feel if you went to a football game  and found out every exciting pass and tremendous field run was choreographed in  advance?    ""People buy tickets to live events because they want to watch artists  accomplish something. Tapes completely negate that. They create kind of like a  supermarket appearance, where audiences end up cheering the celebrity just for  showing up.""    In an interview with The Times, Todd Headlee, who is Milli Vanilli's U.S.  manager, would not say directly whether his act lip-syncs on stage. But he did  comment on Cohen's New Jersey ""disclosure"" measure, which mandates that an  artist's name appear on the face of a ticket with a notice that the entire show  or portions thereof are recorded. Failure to comply could mean penalties of up  to $50,000 for promoters and up to $5,000 for authorized ticket vendors.    ""The bill is ludicrous,"" Headlee said. ""It would be like Burt Reynolds having  to announce before a movie that the hair on his head was not his own, that he  was wearing a toupee.""    Headlee rejects the idea that fans are being hoodwinked.    ""I've seen about 50 Milli Vanilli shows and I can honestly say that there isn't  one person who comes to see them who leaves disappointed,"" Headlee said. ""This  is the wave of the '90s. Fans demand that dance artists get up there and do a  live video. And no one leaves disappointed.""    Dick Scott, manager of New Kids on the Block and president of Dick Scott  Entertainment, maintains that lip-syncing in certain situations can be a valid  solution to the problem of executing elaborate dance routines.    ""I love artists who can sing and, personally, I hate to see lip-syncing done in  concert, especially when it is obvious,"" Scott said in a telephone interview  from his New York office. ""But the problem is that it is very difficult to sing  and duplicate specific songs when they require complicated movements and  fast-paced choreography.    ""If we use a tape, we make every effort to make sure that the tape blends into  the show, so that it doesn't detract from the performance. The main thing, as  far as I'm concerned, is that the show should be entertaining.""    Electronically enhanced singing is not the only technological illusion under  attack on the concert circuit.    Music critics and some musicians repeatedly charge that the increased use of  electronic keyboards and computer programming has reduced the contribution of  live musicians on stage to theatrical mimicry.    They complain that live performances have degenerated into shallow  reconstructions of video shoots that seem to place a higher premium on visual  spectacle than musical innovation.    With the invention of digital sampling (a process that allows any sound to be  digitally analyzed, captured and stored in computer memory to be replayed on  demand), and digital sequencing (a computerized player-piano of sorts), the  demand for musical dexterity on instruments is diminishing.    Anthony Marinelli of Sonar Productions, a Hollywood recording studio that  specializes in tracks generated by the Synclavier -- the Cadillac of digital  sampling/sequencing instruments -- worries about the impact of the  glamour-oriented, high-tech concert scene.    ""We may be looking at a whole new breed of musician coming up here,"" Marinelli  said. ""A bunch of good-looking graduates from the Hair Institute of Technology  who can lip-sync.""    Marinelli says artists employ sampled vocal and instrumental sounds on stage  for a variety of reasons.    ""It's cheaper. It's more consistent. It sounds bigger than life and, unlike  live musicians, it always stays in tune,"" Marinelli said. ""On the downside,  it's like listening to a tape recorder, and to me that isn't what buying a  ticket for a concert is all about.""    But the concerns aren't just aesthetic ones. Jerry Redmond, vice president of  the Musicians Union Local 47 in Los Angeles, worries that modern technology is  putting musicians out of work.    Live orchestras employed at resort hotels are probably the most obvious  casualties of technological fallout. Following a bitter series of ineffective  strikes during the '80s, house musicians in Atlantic City and Las Vegas were  given their walking papers and replaced at revues by recorded music.    As a result, Bob Glasel, president of New York's Musicians Union Local 802,  says music unions around the country have put down their picket signs and begun  to seek relief through legislation.    ""It's the same everywhere -- pop concerts, dance clubs, casinos, circuses --  technology is the trend,"" Glasel said. ""The public is getting ripped off.""    At the urging of Local 802, State Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the  Assembly Committee on Consumer Affairs, introduced a bill in New York that  calls for full disclosure in advertising as to whether instrumental music heard  at an event will be live or reproduced.    In California, Local 47 of the Musicians Union and the California State  Theatrical Federation have endorsed Assemblyman Bob Epple's plan to introduce a  similar proposal in the legislature.    Meanwhile the debate continues.    New Kids manager Dick Scott says ""People pay for entertainment and that's all  they care about. They want to feel something in their heart. They expect  artists to fulfill their expectations, they aren't really concerned with how  artists accomplish it.""    Scott suggests that any truth-in-advertising proposal is an insult to the  intelligence of the audience.    ""Take our upcoming tour, for instance. We're going to feature a number of magic  acts. Will that mean that I have to alert the audience before every show that  when one of the guys levitates or disappears during the performance that it is  only an illusion? Is that what it's coming to?""      Photo, N.J. Assemblymen Joseph Mecca, left, and Neil B. Cohen, introduced  live-or-lip-sync legislation.

There's no attempt to disguise the fact that Madonna's not actually singing  live on stage.    But what about the rest of her concert?    Is she really able to run around the stage with the energy of a marathon runner  without huffing and puffing at some point or missing a note?    Likewise, Janet Jackson executes some equally complicated dance steps during  her highly touted ""Rhythm Nation"" tour. Yet no matter how physically demanding  the novice performer's dancing was at the Forum in Inglewood, Jackson turned in  studio-perfect vocals on every number.    A lot of concertgoers ask themselves: Are these artists really singing? Are the  bands really playing?    What seem like simple questions lead to pop's hottest guessing game -- and a  maze of suspicions and claims, denials and doubts.    Madonna and Janet Jackson concerts aren't the only acts that have left fans  guessing in recent months. Questions have also been raised about such other  dance-oriented acts as Milli Vanilli, New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul.    Some industry insiders insist that tapes -- at least background instrumental or  vocal tapes -- are employed by some acts, but they won't publicly specify who.    ""You won't get any names out of me, but I do know for a fact that there are  groups now that do use tapes to re-create the look and sound of their videos,""  Louis Messina, owner of the Dallas-based Pace Concerts and producer of the 1989  Club MTV tour, said in a telephone interview. ""But I don't necessarily think  that it's wrong. If the audience leaves the concert fulfilled, that's what  counts.""    Representatives of Madonna, Jackson and Abdul deny their acts are using  recorded vocal tapes (except for Madonna's Dick Tracy number), though a member  of Milli Vanilli and a spokesman for New Kids on the Block admit their groups  employ tapes in some cases. The practice, they say, is simply a reflection of  the need to re-create on stage the sophisticated technology of the recording  studio.    ""Of course we work with tapes on a certain level,"" said Milli Vanilli's Rob  Pilatus in a recent interview with a Los Angeles TV station. ""But we sing live,  too. This means that on some songs -- because of the high energy -- we use the  Synclavier, but other songs we sing live.""    But some legislators in California, New York and New Jersey feel it's time for  the guessing game to end.    In May, Assemblyman Neil B. Cohen, vice-chairman of the Consumer Affairs  Committee in the New Jersey State Legislature, joined with Assemblyman Joseph  Mecca in introducing legislation requiring performers to make it clear before  concerts whether they'll sing live or lip-sync to recorded music.    ""We inferred that the current trend toward pre-recorded vocals and electronic  enhancement was to the detriment of the consumer,"" Cohen said.    California Assemblyman Bob Epple and New York Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler are  also trying to enact disclosure bills regarding recorded instrumental tracks.    ""My bill will let consumers know what to expect,"" said Epple, who plans to  introduce his bill in January. ""It will enable them to make an informed  decision as to how they want to spend their money.    Does the consumer really care whether artists perform live or use tapes? Given  the pace at which concerts sell out these days, pop music purists would be  hard-pressed to argue against automation. Truth in advertistng aside, audiences  tend to be enraptured by the picture-perfect performances that computer  technology provides. Contemporary artists are judged less on the merits of  their musical prowess than on the look of their latest video. In this regard,  proponents of tapes insist that automation does not inhibit the concert  experience, it enhances it.    Jennifer Wells, a 15-year-old New Kids on the Block fan club member from  Danville, Calif. doesn't see a problem. ""I've been to four New Kids concerts  and each performance was great,"" said Wells. ""Even if they did lip-sync a  portion of the show, it wouldn't bother me at all. They're great entertainers.""    But Musician magazine editor Bill Flanagan disagrees.    ""Someone grimacing and striking heroic poses to a pre-recorded tape is kind of  like fraud,"" Flanagan said. ""How would you feel if you went to a football game  and found out every exciting pass and tremendous field run was choreographed in  advance?    ""People buy tickets to live events because they want to watch artists  accomplish something. Tapes completely negate that. They create kind of like a  supermarket appearance, where audiences end up cheering the celebrity just for  showing up.""    In an interview with The Times, Todd Headlee, who is Milli Vanilli's U.S.  manager, would not say directly whether his act lip-syncs on stage. But he did  comment on Cohen's New Jersey ""disclosure"" measure, which mandates that an  artist's name appear on the face of a ticket with a notice that the entire show  or portions thereof are recorded. Failure to comply could mean penalties of up  to $50,000 for promoters and up to $5,000 for authorized ticket vendors.    ""The bill is ludicrous,"" Headlee said. ""It would be like Burt Reynolds having  to announce before a movie that the hair on his head was not his own, that he  was wearing a toupee.""    Headlee rejects the idea that fans are being hoodwinked.    ""I've seen about 50 Milli Vanilli shows and I can honestly say that there isn't  one person who comes to see them who leaves disappointed,"" Headlee said. ""This  is the wave of the '90s. Fans demand that dance artists get up there and do a  live video. And no one leaves disappointed.""    Dick Scott, manager of New Kids on the Block and president of Dick Scott  Entertainment, maintains that lip-syncing in certain situations can be a valid  solution to the problem of executing elaborate dance routines.    ""I love artists who can sing and, personally, I hate to see lip-syncing done in  concert, especially when it is obvious,"" Scott said in a telephone interview  from his New York office. ""But the problem is that it is very difficult to sing  and duplicate specific songs when they require complicated movements and  fast-paced choreography.    ""If we use a tape, we make every effort to make sure that the tape blends into  the show, so that it doesn't detract from the performance. The main thing, as  far as I'm concerned, is that the show should be entertaining.""    Electronically enhanced singing is not the only technological illusion under  attack on the concert circuit.    Music critics and some musicians repeatedly charge that the increased use of  electronic keyboards and computer programming has reduced the contribution of  live musicians on stage to theatrical mimicry.    They complain that live performances have degenerated into shallow  reconstructions of video shoots that seem to place a higher premium on visual  spectacle than musical innovation.    With the invention of digital sampling (a process that allows any sound to be  digitally analyzed, captured and stored in computer memory to be replayed on  demand), and digital sequencing (a computerized player-piano of sorts), the  demand for musical dexterity on instruments is diminishing.    Anthony Marinelli of Sonar Productions, a Hollywood recording studio that  specializes in tracks generated by the Synclavier -- the Cadillac of digital  sampling/sequencing instruments -- worries about the impact of the  glamour-oriented, high-tech concert scene.    ""We may be looking at a whole new breed of musician coming up here,"" Marinelli  said. ""A bunch of good-looking graduates from the Hair Institute of Technology  who can lip-sync.""    Marinelli says artists employ sampled vocal and instrumental sounds on stage  for a variety of reasons.    ""It's cheaper. It's more consistent. It sounds bigger than life and, unlike  live musicians, it always stays in tune,"" Marinelli said. ""On the downside,  it's like listening to a tape recorder, and to me that isn't what buying a  ticket for a concert is all about.""    But the concerns aren't just aesthetic ones. Jerry Redmond, vice president of  the Musicians Union Local 47 in Los Angeles, worries that modern technology is  putting musicians out of work.    Live orchestras employed at resort hotels are probably the most obvious  casualties of technological fallout. Following a bitter series of ineffective  strikes during the '80s, house musicians in Atlantic City and Las Vegas were  given their walking papers and replaced at revues by recorded music.    As a result, Bob Glasel, president of New York's Musicians Union Local 802,  says music unions around the country have put down their picket signs and begun  to seek relief through legislation.    ""It's the same everywhere -- pop concerts, dance clubs, casinos, circuses --  technology is the trend,"" Glasel said. ""The public is getting ripped off.""    At the urging of Local 802, State Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the  Assembly Committee on Consumer Affairs, introduced a bill in New York that  calls for full disclosure in advertising as to whether instrumental music heard  at an event will be live or reproduced.    In California, Local 47 of the Musicians Union and the California State  Theatrical Federation have endorsed Assemblyman Bob Epple's plan to introduce a  similar proposal in the legislature.    Meanwhile the debate continues.    New Kids manager Dick Scott says ""People pay for entertainment and that's all  they care about. They want to feel something in their heart. They expect  artists to fulfill their expectations, they aren't really concerned with how  artists accomplish it.""    Scott suggests that any truth-in-advertising proposal is an insult to the  intelligence of the audience.    ""Take our upcoming tour, for instance. We're going to feature a number of magic  acts. Will that mean that I have to alert the audience before every show that  when one of the guys levitates or disappears during the performance that it is  only an illusion? Is that what it's coming to?""      Photo, N.J. Assemblymen Joseph Mecca, left, and Neil B. Cohen, introduced  live-or-lip-sync legislation.

The statement urged that the incumbent authorities of Japan  and Russia should promptly stop the criminal acts of dumping  nuclear waste into the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific Ocean  and, at the same time, remove the already dumped nuclear waste  from the sea without delay and punish those responsible for it.    ``If Russia and Japan continue with their illegal nuclear  waste dumping in disregard of the aspiration of mankind for  environmental protection of the earth, they would be held wholly  responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom,'' warned  the statement.    Recalling that Russia and Japan have annually dumped a large  amount of nuclear waste into the East Sea of Korea and the  Pacific Ocean illegally, it says:    ``Such acts of Russia and Japan are a breach of the  international conventions on protection and conservation of the  sea environment; they are criminal acts of polluting and  wrecking the sea environment and jeopardizing the lives of the  population in the littoral countries.''    ``To protect and conserve the sea environment is a unanimous  demand of the peoples in the littoral areas. And it is already  stipulated under international agreement that radioactive waste,  even less activated one, can never be dumped into the sea.''    ``Moreover, Russia and Japan, as signatories to the London  conventions, are obligated to strive for the prevention of sea  pollution.''    ``This notwithstanding, they are not only vyingly dumping  nuclear waste but also releasing at random even liquid  radioactive pollutants. We cannot but take a serious note of  it.''    ``Such acts of Russia and Japan destroying the earth  environment now are causing deep apprehensions and protests from  the peoples in Asia and the rest of the world and environmental  organizations.''    ``It is ridiculous, indeed, of Russia and Japan to  vociferously urge us to `comply with the Nuclear Safeguards  Agreement', while openly violating the international  conventions, an act reminding us of a thief crying `stop  thief!'''    ``Japan must not try impudently to cover up its wicked acts  in quickening its pace toward nuclear armament by taking issue  with others, but give up the nuclear armament. And Russia, too,  had better control its own nuclear weapons properly, instead of  joining force in slinging mud at other countries, only bringing  disgrace on itself.''    ``The DPRK State Environmental Committee expresses the hope  that the international organisations concerned and the  governments of all countries will pay due attention to it and  exercise their influence so that nobody ever can destroy the  ecological environment of the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific  Ocean.''

Mr Venacio da Moura, Angola's foreign minister, is expected to meet senior State Department officials in Washington this week, although the precise level of the meeting has not yet been arranged. Under the Bush administration, US patience with its long-time ally, the Unita resistance movement led by Mr Jonas Savimbi, was already wearing thin. US officials were irritated by Mr Savimbi's refusal to accept the results of last year's elections, which they viewed as broadly fair. Democrats in Congress have never been as convinced as Republicans that Mr Savimbi was a heroic fighter against communism, and the new administration is expected to have few qualms about abandoning Unita.

The document recalls that at the UN sub-commission on  prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities held  in August, 1993, Japan admitted to the war-time enslavement of  ""comfort women"" by the Japanese Army and Government.    The facts admitted by Japan belong to such paragraphs as  expulsion, enslavement, inhumanity and political and racial  oppression, crimes against humanity, it says, adding that  prescription does not apply to the acts of the Japanese Army and  they must be punished by international law.    It says Japan should therefore take necessary measures for  the punishment of those responsible for the above-mentioned  crimes.    Recalling that in 1932 Japan signed the convention on forced  and compulsory labor which was adopted by the International  Labor Organisation in 1930, the document notes that the present  government should still be obligated for punishment under the  convention.    The criminal acts against ""comfort women"" should have been  punished by the then Japanese ""law"", too, the document says.    It stresses there cannot be any prescription with Japan's  obligation under the international law.    It calls attention to the fact that Japan has not yet  punished the criminals who had inflicted sufferings upon the  more than 200,000 ""comfort women for the army"".    Noting that Japan still refuses to admit that the acts  committed against Asian ""comfort women"", mostly Koreans,  recrimes, the document says such an approach is a disgraceful  insult and discrimination against the Asian women.    The document points to some matters, urging the Japanese  Government to take all measures including legislature,  investigation, trial and punishment and make adequate  compensations to all the ""comfort women for the army"" so as to  fulfil its obligations under the international law regarding the  punishment of those responsible for the criminal acts committed  against the victimized ""comfort women"".

Cook has agreed to become president of a new group, the Forum For Business and Industry. The forum says it will recruit some industrial big guns and act as a sounding board for Labour's nascent industrial plans. More practically, it will also help foot the bill for the painstaking process of constructing policy. Forum members will be expected to cough up Pounds 500 a year to help fund activities. So far 25 recruits have signed up; who they are is currently being kept under wraps. But perhaps a policy costing only Pounds 12,500 to develop is not much to shout about.

The minister attended a large  rally in the city of al-Dali' and addressed crowds from the  district.    At the beginning, he conveyed the greetings of brother  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces,  as well as his wishes and congratulations to them and to our  Yemeni people on the victory over the renegade and secessionist  clique. He said this great victory was achieved thanks to God  and the will of our people and all honorable unionists  everywhere in the Republic of Yemen. He said this victory which  you have achieved made us and every Yemeni citizen proud. He  said that purging the al-Dali' District, as well as the victory  achieved by the heroes of the Armed Forces in it, has restored  the people's confidence in themselves and in their unity.    The city of al-Dali', he said, is the city of heroic deeds  and bravery and the gate of victory that will correct the course  of unity, which will be devoid of factionalism, sectarianism,  cronyism, or regionalism, and which is considered a victory from  almighty God and a victory of right over wrong. He urged all  the sons of the district and all those who left it to return to  their families. He said the state and its leaders will protect  them, provide security for them, and take care of them,  stressing that no harm will come to them. This is, he said, a  promise from Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces,  and from all officials in the Presidential Council, the  government, and the leadership.    He said that the state and Lt. Gen. brother 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih have issued their instructions to implement an electricity  and water project in the city of al-Dali', stressing that the  project will be implemented immediately.    Brother 'Abd-al-Qadir 'Ali Hilal, deputy governor of the Ibb  Governorate, also delivered a speech to the crowds, hailing the  steadfastness of the heroic sons of al-Dali' District, their  support for Constitutional legitimacy, their defense of unity  and democracy, their efforts to entrench the state of order and  law, and their effective participation in defeating the forces  of renegade and secession. He added that the brother leader  president had asked him to form several committees to register  the names of the martyrs and the wounded and the names of those  whose houses were destroyed by the forces of renegade and  secession. This, he said, will take place quickly in order to  ease the suffering of the sons of the district, who faced  disasters at the hands of secessionists before the restoration  of the Yemeni Unity and during the years that followed it,  stressing that victory is for our people, our revolution, and  our unity, and that defeat is for the secessionists. The rally  was attended by Ibb Commander Colonel Muhammad Ahmad al-  Zayyani, al-Dali' District head Muhammad Isma'il Muqbil, and  several officials from A'tabah and (?Dimzah) districts.    The minister of local administration met with the commanders  of the military units and officials in the al-Dali' District and  discussed with them various issues of interest to the district  and its sons. He also inspected (?Dimz) District, met officials  from it, and listened to a number of supply and educational  issues of interest to the citizens. Several officials from the  district attended.

This emerges from the 1993 report by the  Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which was  submitted today in Bonn by Interior Minister Manfred Kanther.  Statements by leading Republikaner representatives indicated  right-wing extremist efforts in contravention of the basic  freedom-based democratic order, the report said. According to  the report, the Republikaner have 16 regional associations  throughout Germany, comprising 23,000 members.    The number of organized and nonorganized right-wing  extremists in Germany has scarcely changed compared with last  year, according to the report. In 1993 there were 41,500.  There are also 650 neo-Nazis belonging to groups that have now  been banned, as well as another 300 who are not in organized  groups. Compared with 1992, acts of violence motivated by  xenophobia decreased by about 30 percent in 1993. In 1993,  1,609 such acts of violence were registered, while in 1992 there  were 2,277. However, the number of other offenses such as  threats or provocation rose from 2,731 to 5,112.    The 1993 report by the Office for the Protection of the  Constitution also says that the threat to internal security as a  result of acts of violence by left-wing extremists was more  serious in 1993 than in the previous year. Reference is made to  the bomb attack on the new prison building in Weiterstadt near  Darmstadt by the Red Army Faction (RAF) terrorist organization  on 27 March 1993, and to the incident on 27 June 1993 in Bad  Kleinen, when suspected RAF terrorist Wolfgang Grams was shot  dead by the GSG-9 crack force. The left-wing extremist potential  is prepared to use force chiefly consisted of anarchists.  Membership of these groups is still growing.    In 1993, the trend emerging since 1988 of foreign extremists  increasingly using violence to enforce their political  objectives has continued. In that context, five people were  killed. A large number of the acts of violence committed by  foreign extremists were attributed to Kurdish and Turkish  left-wing extremist groups. The number of members of Kurdish  organizations is estimated to be 6,900 (1992:4,850).     "

But, it has come to my attention, the magazine is casting about for its annual  sportsman of the year cover and candidates are coming from all over.    I have one for them, the individual I would like to see on the cover of the  last issue of the year.    It's a West German tennis player who may be the best ever to play the game.  Fair-haired, cat-like, No. 1 in the world. Hits the ball with the booming  authority of the born slugger, has this long sweeping stride and is the  most-feared competitor in the game today. Never throws a racket, curses an  umpire, describes the host country as ""the pits"" or acts the spoiled brat.  Never talks much at all. Just smiles. And wins.    Boris Becker? Who said anything about Boom-Boom?    No, my candidate for sportsman of the year is a fraulein, the other half of the  umlaut entry in the world of pro tennis.    Becker is good. But he's not one set better than anybody playing his game.    Steffi Graf is. There are those who think she's a set better than anyone who  ever played her game -- Helen Wills Moody, Mo Connolly, Martina Navratilova,  Chris Evert, Billie Jean King, Margaret Court. She is better than any of them  in the view of longtime tennis coach and scholar Vic Braden. ""She hasn't even  begun to scratch the surface of her talent,"" Braden insists. ""She just stands  at the baseline and beats your brains out. The only time she comes to the net  is to get the check. As soon as she needs some other strokes and other parts of  the game, she'll get them.""    She is only 20 years old. She has earned $5,251,345 on a tennis court. She won  83 of 85 matches she played this year. Of the 16 tournaments she entered, she  won 14 of them and was a finalist in the other two. She has won seven of the  last eight Grand Slam events (French, U.S. and Australian opens plus Wimbledon)  and was a finalist in the other.    She looks more like a Rhine maiden than an athlete. You imagine the Lorelei  looked like this. Or it's a face right out of Grimm's Fairy Tales. She was born  in a gingerbread house. You want to ask her whatever happened to Hansel.    She is as German as a glockenspiel. And fittingly, she plays this kind of  Wagnerian game, full of crashing crescendoes, heroic passages, lyric  transitions. She attacks. She doesn't have quite the tenacity of a Billie Jean  or the stately elegance of a Helen Wills. She's a pouncer. She leaps on a  mistake like a leopard on a waterbuck.    If Orel Hershiser won 83 of every 85 games he pitched, there'd be no question  who'd be Sportsman of the Year every year. If a golfer won 14 of every 16  tournaments he entered, including all the majors or even three out of four,  he'd be a statue in every clubhouse in the country.    Age 20 is a little young to be a figurehead for an entire industry. At 20,  you're supposed to be barely out of teeth braces and Michael Jackson records.  Steffi Graf is a world figure and she doesn't even wear lipstick yet.    Is it a drag?    ""It's all right if you like what you're doing -- and I like what I'm doing,""  insists Graf, in Los Angeles to play a Michelin challenge match with her No. 4  pursuer, Zina Garrison. ""I have good surroundings. I feel good about what I  do.""    Does she find the responsibility a bit sticky -- the lack of privacy, the  demands on her time? ""Well, I've had 2 1/2 years to get used to it,"" she says.  ""I've been No. 1 for that time. And I just grew into (the role). I know what my  responsibilities are, what's expected of me, what my obligations to tennis and  the public are.    ""In Europe, I'm more instantly recognized, but I'm more left alone. They say,  'Oh, it's Steffi!' But they don't bother you for autographs while you're  eating. Here, they are not so considerate.""    How does West Germany react to having not one but two international sports  heroes in Becker and Graf? Who's seeded No. 1 in their little tournament there?    ""We are equal in attention,"" Graf shrugs. ""I don't think about it really. I am  not in competition with Boris Becker. My focus is Martina or Gabriela  (Sabatini).""    Graf has been the best player in the world since the day at Wimbledon in the  final in 1988 when she stopped Martina's win streak of 47 matches there --  three short of Helen Wills Moody's Wimbledon record.    But she admits there is a double standard in tennis. Could she, she is asked,  indulge in the luxury of orbiting a racket into the stands, scorching the ears  of a chair umpire with a collection of epithets more suited to the cab of a  truck than a center court? Graf smiles. ""I don't think it would be so good,""  she admits. ""For me or the game.""    Does she not feel like exploding at times? Graf nods. ""I have a temper,"" she  agrees. ""I get angry when a call is wrong. But I control it, just as I control  the rest of my game. Tennis requires concentration."" So does anger.    For Steffi Graf, life has a net in it. She is either on a baseline or an  airplane. It is the notion here, given gratis to the editors of Sports  Illustrated, that she should be on their cover as sportsperson of the year. One  thing is sure: Her record of success will outmeasure anyone else who may make  it.      Photo, Even when upset, Steffi Graf bends over backward not to lose her cool.

If a golfer won 14 of every 16  tournaments he entered, including all the majors or even three out of four,  he'd be a statue in every clubhouse in the country.    Age 20 is a little young to be a figurehead for an entire industry. At 20,  you're supposed to be barely out of teeth braces and Michael Jackson records.  Steffi Graf is a world figure and she doesn't even wear lipstick yet.    Is it a drag?    ""It's all right if you like what you're doing -- and I like what I'm doing,""  insists Graf, in Los Angeles to play a Michelin challenge match with her No. 4  pursuer, Zina Garrison. ""I have good surroundings. I feel good about what I  do.""    Does she find the responsibility a bit sticky -- the lack of privacy, the  demands on her time? ""Well, I've had 2 1/2 years to get used to it,"" she says.  ""I've been No. 1 for that time. And I just grew into (the role). I know what my  responsibilities are, what's expected of me, what my obligations to tennis and  the public are.    ""In Europe, I'm more instantly recognized, but I'm more left alone. They say,  'Oh, it's Steffi!' But they don't bother you for autographs while you're  eating. Here, they are not so considerate.""    How does West Germany react to having not one but two international sports  heroes in Becker and Graf? Who's seeded No. 1 in their little tournament there?    ""We are equal in attention,"" Graf shrugs. ""I don't think about it really. I am  not in competition with Boris Becker. My focus is Martina or Gabriela  (Sabatini).""    Graf has been the best player in the world since the day at Wimbledon in the  final in 1988 when she stopped Martina's win streak of 47 matches there --  three short of Helen Wills Moody's Wimbledon record.    But she admits there is a double standard in tennis. Could she, she is asked,  indulge in the luxury of orbiting a racket into the stands, scorching the ears  of a chair umpire with a collection of epithets more suited to the cab of a  truck than a center court? Graf smiles. ""I don't think it would be so good,""  she admits. ""For me or the game.""    Does she not feel like exploding at times? Graf nods. ""I have a temper,"" she  agrees. ""I get angry when a call is wrong. But I control it, just as I control  the rest of my game. Tennis requires concentration."" So does anger.    For Steffi Graf, life has a net in it. She is either on a baseline or an  airplane. It is the notion here, given gratis to the editors of Sports  Illustrated, that she should be on their cover as sportsperson of the year. One  thing is sure: Her record of success will outmeasure anyone else who may make  it.      Photo, Even when upset, Steffi Graf bends over backward not to lose her cool.

No longer. The freedoms of a new era have raised everyone's expectations -- and  the familiar junk ballets of the 1990 Bolshoi tour seem a double affront. We've  certainly never been engaged by them, and now the dancers look equally  detached.    Tuesday, the company opened its seven-performance engagement at the Civic  Theatre with the ""Swan Lake"" that artistic director Yuri Grigorovich patched  together in 1969.    Set in bleak ruins designed by Simon Virsaladze, this is a version that does  not actually tell a story but rather makes occasional references to one -- as  if it's aiming to be a dreamlike distillation. Indeed, it sometimes becomes  literally emblematic when huge, decaying coats of arms descend to ornament  major junctures in the action.    Instead of the mime passages of the original that represented conversations in  movement, Grigorovich has people stand around mindlessly bowing to one another  or simply waiting until the music allows somebody to dance. He further wrecks  the work's built-in stylistic contrasts by putting the national dances onto  pointe -- but remains a staunch traditionalist regarding those three fixtures  of Soviet stagings: the Tutor, the Jester and the happy ending.    Diligently conducted by Algis Zhuraitis, the Tchaikovsky score has been  reworked to incorporate passages deleted from most productions -- including the  long-lost Russian dance. The most troublesome novelty: an intense pas d'action  for Odile, Rothbart, Siegfried and a swan mini-corps just preceding (and in a  completely different style from) the Black Swan pas de deux.    Gone are the days when this confused and fundamentally hollow collage could  command committed execution. Look at the swans in the first lakeside scene:  Like the corps, the four cygnets dispatch their choreography efficiently but  with no real spirit -- and the swan trio that immediately follows proves  disastrous in both timing and placement.    Look at the vulgar and unmusical bravura assigned to both the meticulous  Mikhail Sharkov as the Jester and the reckless Alexander Vetrov as Rothbart. In  the name of expanding opportunities for males in ""the classics,"" Grigorovich  has made such men into caricatures of disruptive athleticism.    What happens to artists condemned to this kind of showcase? They either grow  grimly insular (Vetrov) or descend into fey mannerism (Maria Bilova, cast on  Tuesday in the pas de trois of the opening scene). This is a company with  plenty of examples at both extremes.    Because vestiges remain of Petipa and Ivanov, this ""Swan Lake"" becomes  periodically classical, allowing the Swan Queen and Siegfried (no less than the  audience) access to something authentic and purposeful.    On Tuesday, the triumphant dynamism of Nina Ananiashvili complemented the  serene refinement of Alexei Fadeyechev in unexpected but exciting ways. With  her extraordinary upper-torso strength and magnificent ability to flow through  the choreography, Ananiashvili danced even the most lyrical passages at heroic  scale. Yet the sweetly smiling Fadeyechev made her appear a projection of his  needs: a dream-lover he conjured up and then protected with partnering of  ravishing tenderness.    Fadeyechev wasn't always faultless in the virtuoso challenges, and Ananiashvili  looked oddly prosaic in her first lakeside solo (after the White Swan duet),  but nevertheless they exemplified the brilliant abilities of this Bolshoi  generation -- abilities deserving something better than Grigorovich's botched  modernization of a 19th-Century masterwork.    Can they hope to find what they deserve within this company or elsewhere in  Moscow? In Leningrad, perhaps? In London? The question is anything but  speculative these days, and the reputation of the Bolshoi anything but assured.

Look at the vulgar and unmusical bravura assigned to both the meticulous  Mikhail Sharkov as the Jester and the reckless Alexander Vetrov as Rothbart. In  the name of expanding opportunities for males in ""the classics,"" Grigorovich  has made such men into caricatures of disruptive athleticism.    What happens to artists condemned to this kind of showcase? They either grow  grimly insular (Vetrov) or descend into fey mannerism (Maria Bilova, cast on  Tuesday in the pas de trois of the opening scene). This is a company with  plenty of examples at both extremes.    Because vestiges remain of Petipa and Ivanov, this ""Swan Lake"" becomes  periodically classical, allowing the Swan Queen and Siegfried (no less than the  audience) access to something authentic and purposeful.    On Tuesday, the triumphant dynamism of Nina Ananiashvili complemented the  serene refinement of Alexei Fadeyechev in unexpected but exciting ways. With  her extraordinary upper-torso strength and magnificent ability to flow through  the choreography, Ananiashvili danced even the most lyrical passages at heroic  scale. Yet the sweetly smiling Fadeyechev made her appear a projection of his  needs: a dream-lover he conjured up and then protected with partnering of  ravishing tenderness.    Fadeyechev wasn't always faultless in the virtuoso challenges, and Ananiashvili  looked oddly prosaic in her first lakeside solo (after the White Swan duet),  but nevertheless they exemplified the brilliant abilities of this Bolshoi  generation -- abilities deserving something better than Grigorovich's botched  modernization of a 19th-Century masterwork.    Can they hope to find what they deserve within this company or elsewhere in  Moscow? In Leningrad, perhaps? In London? The question is anything but  speculative these days, and the reputation of the Bolshoi anything but assured.

The discussion of the first version of the  draft law several days ago was too passionate, and the draft law  did not get the needed number of votes. Today the document was  approved by the majority of deputies.    Following the coming into force of the new constitution and  the need for bringing legislative acts of subjects of the  Russian Federation into line with it, as well as in connection  with elections to the representative bodies of power and local  government bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, at  which violations of the federal legislation took place, the  State Duma resolved to give some recommendations to the  president of the Russian Federation as the guarantor of the  constitution, of human rights and freedoms.    It recommended to the president to take measures for putting  an end to the violation of electoral rights of individuals and  the rights of local government bodies in the legal acts of  subjects of the Russian Federation, adopted by their executive  authorities, including a possible suspension of those legal  acts. In the opinion of the State Duma, it is also necessary to  take measures for bringing into line with the new Russian  Constitution the presidential decrees and normative acts of  subjects of the Russian Federation, which regulate general  principles of the organisation of representative and executive  bodies of state power of subjects of the Russian Federation, as  well as of local government authorities.    It was suggested to bodies of state power of subjects of the  Russian Federation, the Russian prosecutor-general and the  Central Electoral Commission that they take measures for  bringing into line with the Russian Constitution and legislation  legal acts of subjects of the Russian Federation on the election  of bodies of state power and local government authorities.    The Committee for the Affairs of the Federation and Regional  Policy and the Committee for Local Government Problems of the  State Duma were assigned to work out as a matter of priority  federal draft laws on general principles of the organisation of  the system of state bodies in subjects of the Russian  Federation, as well as local government bodies.

The  Central African Republic has installed political democracy. It  has become a state where there is the rule of law. Since his  investiture, the elected president of the Republic has always  preached dialogue with all the social and political groups of  the nation. He has made social justice and dialogue the  watchwords of his national policy. Unfortunately, this political  will for reconciliation and national reconstruction is not  accepted by a good number of Central Africans.    As the minister of interior and national security, and to  support the head of state's policy, I have continued to receive  in my office some lost sons of the country who deliberately take  pleasure in acts of social agitation and socio-political  upheavals. Despite my appeals for order and national unity, I  have observed and recorded facts of partisan dissentions and  disorders, marked by (?obscene) and irresponsible demonstrations  organized by small groups still pining for an era fresh in the  minds; an ear which supported the very people who caused its  fall [words indistinct] arms. Some people have organized  hotbeds in some areas in the capital with the sole aim of  disturbing public peace and disrupting the smooth running of our  democratic and republican institutions. These hotbeds are  marked by acts of aggression against strangers and French  technical assistants. These are innocent targets who are faced  with armed attacks in their homes.    All these purely barbaric acts only aim at destabilizing the  democratically elected and recently installed government.  Considering the manifest dishonesty insincerity of these [word  indistinct] agitators (?sponsored and trained) by [words  indistinct] which mistake democracy with anarchy, I make it my  duty, as the minister in charge of our country's internal  security and guarantor of public order and (?peace), to make a  public appeal to the national and international community. I  appeal to the organizations for the defense of human rights to  witness this situation. I cannot continue to tolerate such acts  of political agitation, social upheavals, and public disorder in  a state where there is the rule of law.    As the minister of interior and national security, I have  the  duty to install state authority in order to guarantee the  regalia of a democratic state. So, beginning with this warning,  I am giving firm instructions to the competent police to ask  them to ensure, in the implementation of the country's laws,  that all the (?enemies) of democracy are exposed.

The National Narcotics Control Commission has  instructed departments in charge to adopt measures to strengthen  caffeine control.    The circular says: Since last year, some localities have  begun producing natural caffeine in the pretext of pooling funds  with others or exporting it. Some have not made declarations in  accordance with the law. Some even have illegally produced,  sold, and advertised their products without the approval of  public health, medicine, and drug control departments. These  acts have interfered with social order and harmed the health of  the people. Some have constituted crimes.

Watch out -- you  will also fall into that hole.    This is the implication of a serious warning delivered by  Police Commissioner General Johan van der Merwe this week to the  ANC-controlled government over the planned Commission of Truth  and Reconciliation. The commission's task is to hear  confessions from ""criminals"" of the apartheid era. This could  lead to top members of the ANC's National Executive Committee  [NEC], as well as members of cabinet, being scorched as a result  of terrorist activities during this period. This could be a big  embarrassment for the ANC.    RAPPORT is in possession of a harshly worded document in  which General van der Merwe issues a stern warning to the  government over the establishment of the planned commission.  The general also deals sharp blows to the Goldstone Commission.  According to him the Goldstone Commission has come forward with  wild allegations against the security forces which still cannot  be proven in a court of law.    General van der Merwe also points out to government that the  Skweyiya Commission of Inquiry warned back in August 1992 that  ""no one guilty of crimes should ever again be allowed to occupy  an official post. If the ANC is not willing to take definite  steps in this regard then the risk of repetition will always be  present.""    Names    The document, handed to Minister of Safety and Security  Sydney Mufamadi on Wednesday, names among others Defense  Minister Joe Modise, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale,  Ministers Joe Slovo and Mac Maharaj, and Mr. Jacob Zuma, Mr.  Siphiwe Nyanda, and Ronnie Kasrils as ""the prominent members of  the ANC implicated in certain acts of terror.""    The commissioner's document mentions a firm commitment to  see  to his men in the police service. The sharp words of warning to  the government is regarded as an urgent attempt to defuse the  explosive situation behind the scenes and to prevent any  irresponsible actions.    Certain former members of the disbanded security branch and  serving members of the Criminal Investigation Department were  involved in the struggle against the ANC under the old  dispensation. All parties who participated in the struggle may  be involved in the scuffle, to the embarrassment of all  concerned, especially the current government of national unity.  According to General van der Merwe, police investigations,  evidence heard in court cases, as well as other available  information, indicated that members of the ANC and Umkhonto we  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing], involved in  the gruesome violation of human rights, did this under the  orders of the National Executive Committee of the ANC.    Acts of Terrorism    ""During the 1976-1990 period at least 623 acts of sabotage,  terrorism, murder, car bomb explosions, and landmine explosions  can be directly linked to the ANC. In these acts of terrorism  153 people have died, 1,158 people were injured, and more than  20 million rands of damage caused.""    Some of the attackers were caught and charged but others hid  outside the country's borders. In some cases there was  overwhelming proof that certain acts of terrorism were carried  out by senior members of the ANC's NEC abroad, or approved by  them. ""Today these individuals occupy senior positions in  government,"" according to the document by General van der Merwe.  (The implication is that they are occupying these positions in  contradiction with the above mentioned quote by the Skweyiya  Commission: ""No person guilty of crimes ... should ever again  be allowed to occupy an official post."")    The commissioner mentions individual examples of the most  gruesome cases:     -  25 January 1980 -- Silverton bank siege;    -  20 May 1983 -- Church Street bomb in Pretoria;    -  3 April 1984 -- Durban car bomb;    -  23 December 1985 -- Amanzimtoti bomb;    -  9 January 1986 -- landmine explosion in Durban;    -  14 June 1986 -- Durban car bomb;    -  Several landmine explosions in the rural areas of Transvaal  during 1986;    -  20 May 1987 -- landmine explosion at the Johannesburg Court;  and    -  Several attacks in restaurants and shopping centers.     Temporary Indemnity    Members of the ANC's NEC are enjoying temporary indemnity  until 17 May next year. If no amnesty is granted by 17 May then  civil or criminal charges could be laid against alleged  criminals. ""The members of the NEC have never publicly  apologized for the crimes they were responsible for. These  people are, therefore, legally responsible for these acts even  if it is just as accomplices, and in many cases as co-accused,""  says Gen. van der Merwe. He adds that it should be emphasized  that not a single member of the ANC's NEC has thus far applied  for indemnity, but have only been granted temporary indemnity  from prosecution.    ""The Commission (of Truth and Reconciliation) will lead to  further mistrust in the South African Police Services and an  increase in acts of violence against its members. An atmosphere  of mistrust will prevail, affecting prominent individuals  occupying senior positions in government. Steps will have to be  taken to ensure that the amnesty process is not politicized and  does not result in renewed racial conflict and acts of  terrorism.""    General Amnesty    RAPPORT was told that before the elections, police officers,  who insisted behind the scenes that government grant general  amnesty, are waiting to see how the government reacts to the  commissioner's report before further action is decided upon  concerning the establishment of the Commission of Truth and  Reconciliation.    General van der Merwe's document also refers to the Douglas  Commission and the Motsuenyane Commission, who both heard  evidence on terrible violations of human rights committed by ANC  members while they were outside the country's borders. ""These  violations of human rights include murder, serious attacks, and  torture,"" according to the document. The names of Minister of  Foreign Affairs Alfred Nzo, Mr. Joe Slovo, Mr. Modise, Mr.  Kasrils, and Mr. Nhlanhla, implicated in the reports of the  above-mentioned commissions, are mentioned.     "
0," LA122989-0049   154981    December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 3; Column 5; Metro Desk      1020 words      SEX-SHOW SENTENCES DISALLOWED;    COURT: STATE JUSTICES SAY A JURY TRIAL IS APPROPRIATE TO CONTEST CHARGES OF  PERMITTING LEWD ACTS AND PROSTITUTION IN VIOLATION OF A COURT ORDER.      By PHILIP HAGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SAN FRANCISCO      The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that sex-show operators and others are  entitled to a jury trial to contest charges of permitting lewd acts and  prostitution in violation of a court order.    The justices struck down the six-month jail terms and $62,000 in fines facing  James and Artie Mitchell of San Francisco in a contempt proceeding brought  without a jury under the state Red Light Abatement Law.    The court, in a lead opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson, noted that even  though the sentences were imposed for contempt, their severity matched that for  violations of many criminal misdemeanors. ""The California Constitution  guarantees the defendant the right to trial by jury in such a proceeding,""  Eagleson wrote.    The decision marked the second time the case has come before the state high  court -- and the justices Thursday reached substantially the same result as in  a previous January, 1987, ruling under then-Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird.    Shortly after Bird and two other justices defeated in the fall, 1986, election  left office, the new and more conservative court voted quickly to reconsider  the theater case and five other recently issued rulings by the old court. In  five other cases, however, Bird court decisions were rejected or significantly  modified.    Significant Ruling    The decision was hailed by an attorney for the Mitchells as a significant  expansion of the right to a jury trial. ""Historically, the jury has been a  fundamental protection of the citizen against overzealous prosecutors and  pliant judges,"" said Thomas Steel of San Francisco. ""In a case like this, where  emotions often run high, a jury is especially important. It keeps the average  citizen in the process of decision-making.""    Amitai Schwartz, who represented the Bar Assn. of San Francisco in urging the  justices to uphold the jury-trial right, said: ""It's good to see the California  Constitution is alive and well. . . . There's been no retreat.""    State Deputy Atty. Gen. Laurence Sullivan expressed disappointment with the  ruling but declined to speculate on its potential effect. ""We felt we had a  reasonable argument against a jury trial here,"" Sullivan said. ""But obviously  the court disagreed. We accept that.""    In Thursday's action, the court set down other restrictive guidelines for  contempt proceedings under the venerable abatement act, a law that allows  officials to proceed against businesses that offer lewd performances and  prostitution.    The justices ruled that violators of injunctions in such cases may be charged  with only one count of contempt for every day prohibited acts occur -- rather  than being charged with one count per act. Permitting a $1,000 fine for each  lewd act would be ""totally out of proportion,"" the court observed.    And while as an alternative, violators may be held liable for contempt without  a jury trial under a separate, more lenient law -- one with a maximum five days  in jail and $1,000 fine -- the accused must be notified at the outset under  which law prosecutors intend to proceed, the court said.    The ruling resulted from a nine-year legal battle between authorities and the  Mitchell brothers, proprietors of a well-known film and live adult-theater  business that has operated for more than 20 years here.    In 1980, San Francisco prosecutors filed a public-nuisance action against the  Mitchells and theater manager Vincent Stanich under the abatement law. A court  injunction was issued barring the men from allowing acts of ""lewdness or  prostitution"" at the theater.    In 1982, police visiting the premises over a four-day period charged that  performers permitted patrons to engage in oral copulation and other acts off  stage in return for tips. On stage, police said, performers engaged in several  lewd acts with other performers.    After a hearing without a jury, Superior Court Judge Frank W. Shaw found that  the three men had violated the injunction. Under provisions of the abatement  law, the two Mitchells were each fined $62,000 -- $1,000 for each of 62 lewd  acts. Stanich was fined $6,200 -- $100 for each act. All three were sentenced  to the maximum six months in jail but the sentences were stayed pending appeal.    In Thursday's decision, the court noted that the state Constitution guaranteed  trial by jury for all alleged misdemeanors as well as felonies. By clear  implication, the justices said, such protection was intended to extend to other  proceedings where jail terms and fines were as severe as that for some  misdemeanors.    The court rejected the theater operators' contention that there was  insufficient evidence of lewd acts or prostitution occurring in violation of  the injunction.    The justices found, however, that there was not enough proof that Stanich, the  manager, had been able to prevent the acts that took place. While the Mitchell  brothers could be retried, Stanich may not, the court said.    All six court members who participated in the case agreed that the contempt  judgments must be invalidated. Justice Joyce L. Kennard, the newest member of  the court, did not participate.    Justice Stanley Mosk, in a concurring opinion, said he did not believe  prosecutors should be allowed to proceed under the more lenient contempt  statute in order to prevent defendants from receiving a jury trial.    In another decision Thursday, the court reaffirmed its previously imposed ban  on testimony induced by hypnosis -- but ruled that in some instances, witnesses  may still testify about their recollections before they were hypnotized.    The court, ruling in a 1979 San Mateo County murder case, reversed the  defendant's conviction because post-hypnotic testimony identifying him as the  killer was erroneously allowed. But on retrial, the witness will be permitted  to testify about events that she recalled and related before hypnosis, the  justices said.

By PHILIP HAGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SAN FRANCISCO      The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that sex-show operators and others are  entitled to a jury trial to contest charges of permitting lewd acts and  prostitution in violation of a court order.    The justices struck down the six-month jail terms and $62,000 in fines facing  James and Artie Mitchell of San Francisco in a contempt proceeding brought  without a jury under the state Red Light Abatement Law.    The court, in a lead opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson, noted that even  though the sentences were imposed for contempt, their severity matched that for  violations of many criminal misdemeanors. ""The California Constitution  guarantees the defendant the right to trial by jury in such a proceeding,""  Eagleson wrote.    The decision marked the second time the case has come before the state high  court -- and the justices Thursday reached substantially the same result as in  a previous January, 1987, ruling under then-Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird.    Shortly after Bird and two other justices defeated in the fall, 1986, election  left office, the new and more conservative court voted quickly to reconsider  the theater case and five other recently issued rulings by the old court. In  five other cases, however, Bird court decisions were rejected or significantly  modified.    Significant Ruling    The decision was hailed by an attorney for the Mitchells as a significant  expansion of the right to a jury trial. ""Historically, the jury has been a  fundamental protection of the citizen against overzealous prosecutors and  pliant judges,"" said Thomas Steel of San Francisco. ""In a case like this, where  emotions often run high, a jury is especially important. It keeps the average  citizen in the process of decision-making.""    Amitai Schwartz, who represented the Bar Assn. of San Francisco in urging the  justices to uphold the jury-trial right, said: ""It's good to see the California  Constitution is alive and well. . . . There's been no retreat.""    State Deputy Atty. Gen. Laurence Sullivan expressed disappointment with the  ruling but declined to speculate on its potential effect. ""We felt we had a  reasonable argument against a jury trial here,"" Sullivan said. ""But obviously  the court disagreed. We accept that.""    In Thursday's action, the court set down other restrictive guidelines for  contempt proceedings under the venerable abatement act, a law that allows  officials to proceed against businesses that offer lewd performances and  prostitution.    The justices ruled that violators of injunctions in such cases may be charged  with only one count of contempt for every day prohibited acts occur -- rather  than being charged with one count per act. Permitting a $1,000 fine for each  lewd act would be ""totally out of proportion,"" the court observed.    And while as an alternative, violators may be held liable for contempt without  a jury trial under a separate, more lenient law -- one with a maximum five days  in jail and $1,000 fine -- the accused must be notified at the outset under  which law prosecutors intend to proceed, the court said.    The ruling resulted from a nine-year legal battle between authorities and the  Mitchell brothers, proprietors of a well-known film and live adult-theater  business that has operated for more than 20 years here.    In 1980, San Francisco prosecutors filed a public-nuisance action against the  Mitchells and theater manager Vincent Stanich under the abatement law. A court  injunction was issued barring the men from allowing acts of ""lewdness or  prostitution"" at the theater.    In 1982, police visiting the premises over a four-day period charged that  performers permitted patrons to engage in oral copulation and other acts off  stage in return for tips. On stage, police said, performers engaged in several  lewd acts with other performers.    After a hearing without a jury, Superior Court Judge Frank W. Shaw found that  the three men had violated the injunction. Under provisions of the abatement  law, the two Mitchells were each fined $62,000 -- $1,000 for each of 62 lewd  acts. Stanich was fined $6,200 -- $100 for each act. All three were sentenced  to the maximum six months in jail but the sentences were stayed pending appeal.    In Thursday's decision, the court noted that the state Constitution guaranteed  trial by jury for all alleged misdemeanors as well as felonies. By clear  implication, the justices said, such protection was intended to extend to other  proceedings where jail terms and fines were as severe as that for some  misdemeanors.    The court rejected the theater operators' contention that there was  insufficient evidence of lewd acts or prostitution occurring in violation of  the injunction.    The justices found, however, that there was not enough proof that Stanich, the  manager, had been able to prevent the acts that took place. While the Mitchell  brothers could be retried, Stanich may not, the court said.    All six court members who participated in the case agreed that the contempt  judgments must be invalidated. Justice Joyce L. Kennard, the newest member of  the court, did not participate.    Justice Stanley Mosk, in a concurring opinion, said he did not believe  prosecutors should be allowed to proceed under the more lenient contempt  statute in order to prevent defendants from receiving a jury trial.    In another decision Thursday, the court reaffirmed its previously imposed ban  on testimony induced by hypnosis -- but ruled that in some instances, witnesses  may still testify about their recollections before they were hypnotized.    The court, ruling in a 1979 San Mateo County murder case, reversed the  defendant's conviction because post-hypnotic testimony identifying him as the  killer was erroneously allowed. But on retrial, the witness will be permitted  to testify about events that she recalled and related before hypnosis, the  justices said.    A 1985 state law sharply restricts the use of pre-hypnosis testimony to cases  where statements have been preserved in writing or tape and subsequent hypnosis  was performed by licensed experts. But the law, the court said, applies only to  pre-hypnotic evidence taken after the law was passed.

Since mid-May this year, the Vietnamese side has sent  exploratory vessels to Wan An Reef (Vanguard Bank) area of  China's Nansha [Spratly] sea area to conduct geophysical  operation, spokesman Shen Guofang said at a weekly press  conference this afternoon.    As is known to all, China has indisputable sovereignty over  the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters, and Wan An Reef is  part of the Nansha islands, he said.    In recent years, Vietnam has demarcated certain blocks in  this area for external bidding and repeatedly harassed the  normal scientific survey and fishing activities of Chinese  vessels, he said. Now it has moved into this area for oil and  gas prospecting and development.    ""It must be pointed out that these moves have seriously  violated China's sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, and also  put the `Wab-21' petroleum contract signed between China  National Offshore Oil Corporation and Crestone Energy  Corporation of the U.S.A. in serious jeopardy"", Shen said.    The Chinese side has made solemn representations on many  occasions to the Vietnamese side over its acts of violating  China's sovereignty in Nansha, he said.

Mr Venacio da Moura, Angola's foreign minister, is expected to meet senior State Department officials in Washington this week, although the precise level of the meeting has not yet been arranged. Under the Bush administration, US patience with its long-time ally, the Unita resistance movement led by Mr Jonas Savimbi, was already wearing thin. US officials were irritated by Mr Savimbi's refusal to accept the results of last year's elections, which they viewed as broadly fair. Democrats in Congress have never been as convinced as Republicans that Mr Savimbi was a heroic fighter against communism, and the new administration is expected to have few qualms about abandoning Unita. Indeed, administration officials last week stiffly warned Mr Savimbi not to attack US-owned oilfields in the province of Cabinda.

Even though our countries' pilgrims were  not allowed by the Saudi regime to carry out their  political-religious ceremony of the disavowal of pagans, their  self-restraint and the meaningless silence of the pilgrims from  Iran and the other Islamic countries were the best ways to  awaken the Muslims of the world.    Saudi Arabia's prevention of the Ibrahimite ceremony of the  disavowal of pagans and the silence that spread during the Hajj  ceremonies because of it will undoubtedly have their impact.  The non-Iranian pilgrims will ask themselves the reason for the  police atmosphere that ruled the ceremonies and the policy of  intimidating the pilgrims.    Despite the claim that it would not disrupt the pilgrims'  programs, the Saudi Government did create problems. After  returning to Tehran, the representative of the supreme leader  and the head of the Iranian pilgrims referred to the siege on  his mission and stated that this act by Saudi Arabia upset the  performance of the Hajj rites by the pilgrims. He added that  members of the mission were even prevented from entering Medina,  contrary to the agreement that had been reached.    The unfavorable atmosphere that upset the Hajj ceremonies  shows the weakness of the Saudi Government in managing the holy  shrines, and the news about this will undoubtedly not have good  consequences for the unfit custodian of the house of God. The  message from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia during this year's Hajj  and his unity-breaking remarks put an end to many doubts and  revealed the face of the major mentors of this regime, who  undoubtedly have a long record of plotting against the Muslims  in the region and in the world of Islam.    With the exposure of this behavior, the world of Islam will  ask itself whose hands the house of God is in and what meaning  this resistance against religious-political ceremonies and the  expression of disgust toward America and Israel will have. In  other words, the irresponsible acts by the Saudi Government  further disgraces those who have diverted from the true path in  Islamic society and doubles the brightness of the front of  justice. The repercussions that the obstructionist acts by the  Saudi police will have will not be very favorable, even in Saudi  society, and everyone will realize why the Saudi regime feared  the disavowal of pagans ceremony.    In view of regional developments and the compromise trend in  the Middle East, Islamic nations are facing more serious threats  and plots that will not only hold the perpetrators of discordant  acts answerable to history but will also list their acts among  the Muslims of the world as contrary to Islamic interests.

These influential forces, up to  the issuance of this statement, continue to amass large forces  to besiege and strike at the 3d Armored Brigade and heroic  citizens from among the sons of the people of Jabal Iyal, Yazid,  Iyal Sarih, Sufyan, Arhab, Bani Abd, and other honorable  citizens.    The 3d Armored Battalion moved to new positions in the Sanaa  Governorate, and was subjected to barbarous and treacherous  aggression by the 1st Armored Brigade, Republican Guard forces,  and central security and tribal forces, which were transported  to 'Imran from other areas a few hours before the military  conflict, which was led by such warmongers as Humud Atif and Ali  Hamid Qulaydan. These forces were not satisfied with imposing  an intensive siege on the new positions to which the 3d Armored  Brigade had moved, but prevented the passage of food and medical  supplies, as well as the transport of the dead and wounded to  the hospitals. Indeed, they went further in their violations of  human rights and the genuine ideals and norms of our Yemen  people by throwing the wounded into prison and subjecting them  to torture. They were treated as if they were POW's from a  foreign army -- not the sons of the same homeland. This  irresponsible stance by the ruling military family reached its  peak when it left the wounded to die on the battlefields.    The military family provided aid only for certain wounded  persons -- this is the expression of an abominable secessionist  trend. More atrocious than this was that the representatives of  the ruling military family supervised the dragging of the  wounded as POW's to central security cells, where they were  tortured while interrogated. This is a cheap game they play for  the media, without any conscience or moral restraint.    There is no doubt that giving orders to strike at the 3d  Brigade was tantamount to a declaration of civil war, which was  issued by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, frankly and clearly,  on 27 April, prior to the military conflict in 'Imran. This was  the same day that aggression was committed against the 3d  Armored Brigade in 'Imran, as part of a military and political  plan by the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Alliance for  Reform, and the ruling military family. The aggression was  committed two hours after the war declaration was delivered by  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the secretary general of the  General People's Congress. It is now clear that the plan is  aimed at emptying the northern governorates of the brigades  which moved there after the declared union of north and south  Yemen, and at their bloody liquidation by dealing with them one  at a time in a gradual manner. This has been done by contriving  many different, flimsy justifications as a prelude to engagement  in an overall war, a war planned by fundamentalist forces in the  General People's Congress and the Yemeni Alliance for Reform, in  addition to external fundamentalist forces, and with the support  of the ruling military family in Sanaa.    It is now confirmed that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is  the one who is personally commanding this grave military action  from the operations room. It is he who is issuing directives to  pursue the 3d Brigade and liquidate it, after having given  orders for striking and annihilating it. He has been leaking  misleading information to the international news media about the  annihilation of the 3d Brigade during the incident, to cover his  pursuit of the heroes of the brigade as they moved to to new  positions. It is he who is personally supervising ongoing  preparations to strike the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar, as well  as the build-up of reinforcements around it, and the besieging  of that brigade by Republican Guard and central security  brigades, along with the assistance from battalions from the  Majd Brigade, which was moved from Bajil in the Hudaydah  Governorate.    The 3d Brigade faced with rare heroism the atrocious  conspiracy and the loathsome crime to which it was subjected.  It managed to withdraw outside its camp after its stores and  ammunitions, as well as a part of its forces, had been  destroyed. Had President Ali Salih been a unionist and  responsible for all the people, in accordance with the oath he  took before the House of Deputies, in the name of God Almighty,  to bear his responsibility with honesty -- had the president  been so, it was in his power, while commanding and directing the  battle personally, to work for the preservation of what was left  of the 1st and 3d Brigades. However, he gave orders for the  pursuit of the 3d Brigade, with the aim of annihilating it. He  pushed two brigades from the Republican Guards and central  security forces, under the command of his brothers, in addition  to other warmongers such as Sheikh Humud Atif and Sheikh Ali  Hamid Qulaydan, to pursue the brigade after it was cut off from  food supplies, fuel and water.    We appeal to public opinion; human rights organizations; the  Yemeni, Arab and International Red Cross and Red Crescent  Societies; and to all those with living human consciences to  provide essential and urgent assistance to save the wounded,  remove the dead, and stop the horrific actions to which the  wounded are being subjected in the prisons of the ruling  military family.    This crime indicates that those who are managing and  implementing this operation, bit by bit, do not care about  sacrificing everyone to stay in power. This confirms what  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said in Amman, that he was ready  to wage war and sacrifice 30,000 soldiers to liquidate the YSP.  What is being prepared and planned now must be regarded as part  of a bloody and horrible venture, which is likely to inflict  great harm on the unity of the homeland, its security, and  stability. Indications of the start of the implementation of  this reckless venture appeared in a political statement issued  personally by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in a speech he  delivered in the Sab'in ground on 27 April. It included attacks  which were inappropriate from a head of state against a party  which is his partner in power, and against opposition parties  and the dialogue commission which [word indistinct] that great  historical and national achievement reflected in the pledge and  accord document.    The president was not satisfied with that only, but was keen  to include in his speech an open call to spark off a civil war,  and issue a fatwa for a jihad, similar to the fatwas issued by  heads of terrorist organizations to justify their acts of murder  and assissinations. The speech called on every individual to  make himself a judge, a prosecutor general, and the president of  a court. This indicates a desire to undermine the constitutional  and legal foundations of the unified state and open the door to  anarchy, terrorism, and civil war as an excuse for secession.    The YSP, as it is part of the masses of our people and its  political parties and its vital forces, expresses its deep  concern over the insistence of the ruling military family in  Sanaa to spark off of a civil war in Yemen. It holds  responsible those adventurist forces. President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih must bear full and personal responsibility for what has  happened, and continues to happen with regard to the shedding of  the blood of the Yemeni Armed Forces and the threatening of the  unity of the homeland, since orders were issued to part of the  Yemeni Army to strike at another part of the same army. This is  unethical and unpatriotic, and we cannot remain silent about it.  It is difficult for the people to understand the legitimacy  about which General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was talking. It is  also difficult for all of us to understand the unity which they  speak about so flippantly, while they direct their treacherous  artillery against it.    The statement, leaked to the news media by the ruling  military family and its puppets concerning the pursuit of the  commander of the 3d Armored Brigade, the heroic Colonel (Sayf  al- Bakri) and the militant brother Yahya Dahis, is a  disgraceful act indicating the bankruptcy of its authors. It is  an attempt to get a cover for the justification of the  massacres. The adventurers in Sanaa are planning to continue  the attack on the 3d Armored Brigade at its new positions north  of Sanaa. Those who issued these orders should be ashamed of  themselves. The commander of the brigade, accused by the ruling  family of having given orders to the 3d Brigade, was taking his  lunch in a mess with members of the joint military commission in  the presence of the U.S. and French military attaches and a  number of officers of the brigade. Brother Yahya Dahis was not  even present at the camp. The commander of the brigade was  surprised by the explosion inside the camp, as was the joint  military commission.    We can say with all confidence that those who should be put  on trial are the adventurers who issued orders to start the  implementation of the extermination plan and above all the civil  war. The criminal and engineer of terror, murder and  assassination, is Col. Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, who began the  implementation of the first phase of this war when he struck the  unarmed 5th Brigade at Harf Sufyan. He then continued his war  against the 3d Brigade.    He may continue it in a different phase tomorrow and in a  different place in the northern governorates and face units  moving towards southern governorates.    The attack against the 3d Brigade is a detestable crime  which  will not pass away easily and the insistence on besieging and  pursuit of this brigade, aimed at annihilating it, will also not  pass away easily. Because that means the launching of total  civil war, whose responsibility and aftermath will rest on those  adventurous secessionists. The spokesman stressed that true  unity is the unity being manifested today in its various  aspects, insofar as the heroes of the 3d Armored Brigade are  joining together with hundreds of thousands of the heroes of the  al-Sanadid tribe in the areas to which the brigade's positions  have been moved, and where it was welcomed in a brotherly,  nationalistic and unionist manner. Those heroes who are coming  together today as one are the true unionists, while those  adventurists implementing the plot to detonate civil war in  Yemen [words indistinct] are the true secessionists.

0,FT934-8687 ,"FT934-8687 _AN-DKNANAFVFT 931113   FT  13 NOV 93 / Books: Motivated by the heroic and the erotic - Rodin and his monumental works      By ANTHONY CURTIS   RODIN: THE SHAPE OF GENIUS by Ruth Butler Yale, Pounds 19.95, 591 pages TOWARDS THE end of his career Rodin acquired a following among famous and fashionable people in Edwardian England. One of the earliest to perceive his genius was the poet WE Henley, coiner of the phrase 'bloody, but unbowed' - a highly Rodinesque sentiment. Rodin carved portraits of prominent Tory politicians like George Wyndham and Charlotte Shaw commissioned Rodin to make a bust of her playwright husband. The Shaws went to Rodin's studio at Meudon and despite the language barrier the two geniuses got along splendidly. Rodin's young secretary, who happened to be the German poet Rilke, marvelled at Shaw's energetic way of posing, '. . . his whole personality seems to become concentrated essence'. Rilke invited the American photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn along. Not content with just having his portrait sculpted, Shaw insisted on posing in the nude in the manner of Rodin's 'The Thinker'. Coburn's photograph of this piece of Shavian effrontery is reproduced in Ruth Butler's thoughtful new biography, Rodin: The Shape of Genius. The photograph may be seen as an icon of the whole Rodin story. Shaw believed zealously in the Superman, and it was Rodin who gave the idea of the Superman palpable form in his public monuments, blending realism and grandeur. Some of these were of heroic figures from contemporary life, Victor Hugo and Balzac. Others from episodes in French history, the 'Burghers of Calais' surrendering to Edward III, or from classical legend and literature. 'The Thinker', the most famous statue of the 19th century, has its origin in Dante's Divine Comedy. Rodin was commissioned to carve the bronze doors to the entrance to a projected Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. He conceived a grandiose scheme whereby the panels would represent scenes from the Inferno, and towering above them, he placed the brooding figure of Dante. As this figure developed it ceased to be merely that of the poet and became a super-genius, Rodin himself, pondering all the ills of the world. In the end the Museum was never built but Rodin worked on at his panels, known now as 'The Gates of Hell'. Other figures from the Gates that acquired a separate existence are those of 'The Kiss', originally Dante's Paolo and Francesca, banished to Hell for their illicit love. The heroic and the erotic - these were the drives that motivated Rodin in his re-creation of the human form from his time as an apprentice to his death in 1917. He was fortunate to live during the Third Republic when France became obsessed by the need to put up public monuments to honour its outstanding men of genius but the commissions always involved tiresome monitoring by committees responsible to those who had contributed the funding. Rodin's relations with these committees and with the arts ministers who headed them were often conducted at breaking-point. He was incorrigibly bad at meeting deadlines. This was because he tended to take on too many commissions at once; and because he liked to ponder a major work for years making preliminary sketches and maquettes. Above all, the candour of his conceptions frequently affronted the sensibilities of his employers. His 'Monument to Victor Hugo' depicting the poet's body in the nude was luckily acclaimed when it was shown at the Salon, but his version of Balzac - a phallic-shaped white hulk, shrouded in his coat, gazing heavenwards through dark glasses - was too much for the Society of Men of Letters who had commissioned it. Bernard Berenson said it looked like a polar bear standing on its hind legs. Rejected, it ended up in Rodin's garden. Butler goes at great length into the long wranglings that surrounded the creation of these masterpieces and her accounts make melancholy reading. We could have done with more about the works' ultimate importance in the history of art. Rodin's relations with women (dealt with very fully in the earlier biography by Frederic Grunfeld in 1987) are just as depressing. Butler regards the early death of Rodin's supportive and purposeful elder sister, Maria, a nun, as the crucial trauma. Rodin found a substitute in his first pupil, Camille Claudel, sister to Paul Claudel, a fine sculptor and early feminist. Their affair ended suddenly in a brutal separation. There were many other mistresses. Some were rich patrons like the American-born Princesse de Choiseul; others were artists who sat at his feet like the English painter Gwen John. But with none of them did Rodin manage to sustain a satisfactory lasting relation. There is something sadly touching in Rodin's refusal completely to discard his earliest mistress, a low-class model, Rose Beuret. Rose became his servant, putting up with his absence for months on end. But he did continue to provide for her and the dim-witted son he had by her and, somewhat surprisingly, at the age of 77 he married Rose while on his deathbed. The nature of his private fantasies about women may be seen in the large collection of erotic drawings discovered after his death. His work as a whole is permanently on view in the Musee Rodin in Paris (formerly the Hotel Biron occupied by Rodin at end of his life and bequeathed by him with its contents to the city). No admirer of Rodin can afford to neglect this biography which gives a fuller account of his life than any previous one. But the writing is not always elegant and the reader will need to look elsewhere for an appraisal of the works. In addition to the notes and bibliography, a full chronology of the life should have been included.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2731 Book Publishing.

KNOPF: $19.95; 320 PP;  0-394-58313-2)      By Nancy Mairs, Mairs' memoir, Remembering the Bone House, has recently been  issued in paperback by Harper & Row.      ""The Quest,"" Germaine Greer titles the opening chapter of ""Daddy, We Hardly  Knew You,"" a memoir of her search for her father's past begun after his death  in 1983, as if to lift her pursuit to mythic heights. But the premise of the  heroic quest is that its object possesses unique, often mysterious, even  sacred, value, capable of transforming at least the searcher and generally the  wider world as well. In these terms, Greer's is an anti-quest: ""a classic  example of herstory (sic), puncturing the ideology"" of the hero.    Although she knew her father for more than 40 years, Greer learned almost  nothing about his background, and what little information he released, she  discovers, was fabricated. Reticence this absolute seems all but implausible,  but apparently the ""anxiety neurosis"" with which Reg Greer returned from World  War II effectively barred all inquiry.    ""You will be wondering why I did not simply ask my mother,"" Greer says. Yes,  indeed, that's exactly what I was wondering. ""Suffice it to say that for Mother  language is a weapon rather than a means of communication."" Two less appealing  creatures than Reg and Peggy Greer, as seen through their daughter's eyes,  would be hard to imagine. But at least their singularly uncooperative natures  provide her the pretext for a book.    And a book of sorts she produces: part childhood reminiscence, part travelogue,  part genealogy, part history, part social commentary. Unfortunately, the lack  of something meaningful at the center (Daddy, I believe) prevents these  elements from coalescing. Greer is a skillful writer, and there are plenty of  terrific passages here: quick insights (""Our whole lives are lived in a tangle  of telling, not telling, misleading, allowing to know, concealing,  eavesdropping and collusion""); painterly descriptions of landscape from  Tasmania to Tuscany; a breathtaking evocation of conditions during the siege of  Malta. Too often, however, the insights are facile.    This clutter becomes especially troublesome with regard to the book's central  purpose: the revelation of the ""truth"" about Reg Greer's life, which his  daughter confounds with the knowledge of his origins and antecedents. Now, as  the popularity of Alex Haley's ""Roots"" demonstrated some time ago, many people  are fascinated by their lineage; at least half a dozen of my friends and  relations pursue their forebears with varying degrees of preoccupation. But it  seems a queer sort of obsession for a feminist to take up with scant  reflection; and really this author of an early and influential feminist text,  ""The Female Eunuch,"" has given herself over to her patrilineal search with far  fewer and less sophisticated questions than readers might reasonably hope.    Instead, with prodigious expenditures of money, time and energy, she amasses  and recounts quantities of genealogical detail. She is nothing if not the  ""doggedest of daughters,"" and the descriptions of her research methods,  frustrations and victories may prove instructive to other genealogists. The  rest of her readers must simply slog along in her wake (wondering, perhaps, why  she perseveres until they read: ""I cannot go backward. I've spent too much of  the advance.""

KNOPF: $19.95; 320 PP;  0-394-58313-2)      By Nancy Mairs, Mairs' memoir, Remembering the Bone House, has recently been  issued in paperback by Harper & Row.      ""The Quest,"" Germaine Greer titles the opening chapter of ""Daddy, We Hardly  Knew You,"" a memoir of her search for her father's past begun after his death  in 1983, as if to lift her pursuit to mythic heights. But the premise of the  heroic quest is that its object possesses unique, often mysterious, even  sacred, value, capable of transforming at least the searcher and generally the  wider world as well. In these terms, Greer's is an anti-quest: ""a classic  example of herstory (sic), puncturing the ideology"" of the hero.    Although she knew her father for more than 40 years, Greer learned almost  nothing about his background, and what little information he released, she  discovers, was fabricated. Reticence this absolute seems all but implausible,  but apparently the ""anxiety neurosis"" with which Reg Greer returned from World  War II effectively barred all inquiry.    ""You will be wondering why I did not simply ask my mother,"" Greer says. Yes,  indeed, that's exactly what I was wondering. ""Suffice it to say that for Mother  language is a weapon rather than a means of communication."" Two less appealing  creatures than Reg and Peggy Greer, as seen through their daughter's eyes,  would be hard to imagine. But at least their singularly uncooperative natures  provide her the pretext for a book.    And a book of sorts she produces: part childhood reminiscence, part travelogue,  part genealogy, part history, part social commentary. Unfortunately, the lack  of something meaningful at the center (Daddy, I believe) prevents these  elements from coalescing. Greer is a skillful writer, and there are plenty of  terrific passages here: quick insights (""Our whole lives are lived in a tangle  of telling, not telling, misleading, allowing to know, concealing,  eavesdropping and collusion""); painterly descriptions of landscape from  Tasmania to Tuscany; a breathtaking evocation of conditions during the siege of  Malta. Too often, however, the insights are facile.    This clutter becomes especially troublesome with regard to the book's central  purpose: the revelation of the ""truth"" about Reg Greer's life, which his  daughter confounds with the knowledge of his origins and antecedents. Now, as  the popularity of Alex Haley's ""Roots"" demonstrated some time ago, many people  are fascinated by their lineage; at least half a dozen of my friends and  relations pursue their forebears with varying degrees of preoccupation. But it  seems a queer sort of obsession for a feminist to take up with scant  reflection; and really this author of an early and influential feminist text,  ""The Female Eunuch,"" has given herself over to her patrilineal search with far  fewer and less sophisticated questions than readers might reasonably hope.    Instead, with prodigious expenditures of money, time and energy, she amasses  and recounts quantities of genealogical detail. She is nothing if not the  ""doggedest of daughters,"" and the descriptions of her research methods,  frustrations and victories may prove instructive to other genealogists. The  rest of her readers must simply slog along in her wake (wondering, perhaps, why  she perseveres until they read: ""I cannot go backward. I've spent too much of  the advance."" Ah, Knopf has paid for a book, and a book they shall have).    For naught, it turns out. Because, after transforming herself into ""a  Greero-logist, a Greerographer, a Greeromane"" and summarizing one Greer  pedigree after another (perhaps so that her readers can experience the same  sense of wasted time she endured), she turns out to be ""not a Greer"" at all but  a Greeney by adoption, a Hamilton by birth.

By DANIEL CERONE      About 130 miles off the coast of San Diego, in a claustrophobic, smoke-filled  cabin aboard the aircraft carrier USS Independence, actor Willem Dafoe is lying  on his bunk thinking about Auschwitz. It isn't too difficult. Dafoe has  countless hours to while away over the next 10 days in this tiny metallic  cabin, which he likens to a prison cell.    He is on board the bulky carrier shooting ""Flight of the Intruder,"" a  big-budget action film for Paramount. In ""Flight,"" a John Milius film being  adapted from the best-seller by Stephen Coonts, Dafoe plays a heroic A-6  bombardier navigator. The role returns him, in theme at least, to a setting --  the Vietnam War -- he has visited three times before: as an infantry sergeant  in ""Platoon,"" as an MP investigator in ""Off Limits"" and as a returned disabled  vet in the upcoming ""Born on the Fourth of July.""    But at the moment, Dafoe is taking a break to reflect on the making of ""Triumph  of the Spirit,"" for which he spent four months earlier this year filming in the  haunting remains of the Auschwitz death camp in Poland.    ""The place, in a very subtle and mysterious way, worked on you,"" Dafoe says,  sitting up in his bunk. His gaunt, depleted appearance in ""Triumph"" has been  replaced by a scrubbed face and the crisp, sharp edges of a Navy uniform. ""I  mean, it's easy to imagine. You'd pass by places that were so resonant -- a  holding tank, a furnace. And that would stir your imagination and make you ask  some hard questions.""    At Auschwitz, the 34-year-old actor did his best to relive the true-life  experiences of Salamo Arouch, a Greek Jew and middleweight boxing champion of  the Balkans who survived the World War II concentration camp by fighting other  prisoners -- in between trained poodle shows and female impersonator acts -- in  a blood-stained arena for the sheer pleasure of Nazi officers.    ""The truth, what went on there, is forever going to only stay with the  initiator,"" Dafoe says. ""There's no way for us (in the film) to tell you  anything about it, or to explain what it was like. All we could do is create a  sense of reality in the spirit of Salamo, and hopefully reveal something  through Salamo. The character is like a witness. He's your guide through  Auschwitz.""    Arouch, now in his 60s and living in Israel, was on the set of ""Triumph"" as an  adviser, returning to the camp where, as a young inmate, he fought and defeated  more than 200 opponents. He had to win each fight, since the loser was often  marched to the gas chamber. Was the presence of the death camp survivor on the  set like a ghost rising from the ashes of Auschwitz?    ""Oddly enough, no,"" Dafoe says. ""I mean no disrespect -- I'm sure he's deeply  scarred by this -- but he was a happy, tough old guy who wanted to tell stories  and take me out in the ring and fight me."" Dafoe laughs, and then quickly gets  very quiet.    ""You have to understand, this is a man who loves life. The guy looked me in the  eye and said, 'Life is a gift. Enjoy it.' That means something coming from him.  He gave us his story, his blessing and some good advice. But I felt it was for  me to go through the story and find my own way. He wasn't sitting there telling  me what to think or how to feel.""    Dafoe says he has no idea how ""Triumph"" will be accepted in the shifting  political climate of Poland, volunteering that he is not out to make social or  political statements with his acting.    ""At this point I don't feel like I have anything to say. I feel much more  comfortable doing things. Serving myself up to roles as if my life depended  upon them -- that's my contribution. Committing myself to roles that have the  possibility to express something larger than life.""    The actor's personal politics may be elusive off screen, but chances are, no  one has ever accused a Dafoe character of sitting on the fence. If his  characters are not out to save the world, they are probably trying to destroy  it. Most of them have hearts of gold, stone, or fire. The Good, the Bad and the  Angry.    Dafoe's elemental roles, which he calls ""forces of nature,"" include the  persecuted Jesus Christ in ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (the Good), a  homicidal counterfeiter in ""To Live and Die in L.A."" (the Bad) and a shrill  paraplegic Vietnam War vet (the Angry) in Oliver Stone's ""Born on the Fourth of  July."" His portrayal of the ""good"" sergeant in ""Platoon"" earned him an Oscar  nomination for best supporting actor.    ""What attracts me to those kind of roles?,"" Dafoe says, lying back on his bunk  and repeating the question. His eyes wander upward, unfocused as he frames his  answer. ""I think they're mythic. They have some sort of size. They're fact.  They go beyond identification, sometimes even beyond logic. They're not an  imitation of something. They're the thing itself.""    A native of Wisconsin, Dafoe lives in New York now, where he got started acting  on stage more than a decade ago. He began to catch the eye of Hollywood  directors playing the maniacal urban gang leader in Walter Hill's 1984 ""Streets  of Fire,"" and he hit the casting agent's A-list with his performance in the  surprisingly commercial ""Platoon.""    Since ""Platoon,"" Dafoe has been one of the busiest actors around, starring in  ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" ""Off Limits,"" and ""Mississippi Burning."" He  has just completed a role as a creepy sociopath in David Lynch's ""Wild at  Heart"" and goes directly from ""Flight of the Intruder,"" which wraps next month,  to star in the comedy, ""Arrive Alive,"" for director Jeremiah Chechik (""National  Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"").    Despite the string of suffering roles he has played, Dafoe says his decisions  are guided by characters he thinks would be fun to play.    ""Above all, you look at what the character does,"" Dafoe says, ""and you ask  yourself: 'Do I want to do those things? Is it going to be fun to take a walk  in those shoes?'

The baseness of the perpetrators, the  excruciating pain of the victims -- they make the world succumb  to enormous rage, but rage that is at the same time helpless.  Helpless Rage? Yes, because the hope is deceptive that other  states could and will put an end to this war from the outside  and against the will of the three parties to the war -- the  Muslims, the Croats, and the Serbs in and around Bosnia.    Who could not understand that, in view of the terrible  massacres, more and more citizens and politicians demand action,  at least air strikes at the Serb artillery positions around  Sarajevo? If it was indeed the Serbs, who have those 68 dead  and more than 200 injured on their conscience. However,  retaliation -- no matter how vital and understandable the need  for it is -- is no motive for responsible military action.    Even in the storm of disgust and despair one cannot avoid  the  nagging questions that must be asked about the second and third  step that will follow the first: Who is the opponent? What  does one want and can one force him to do it definitely with  military means? Is success likely? What effort and sacrifice  would the fight cost? And can one politically expect one's own  citizens to accept these sacrifices because they are in the  interest of their state?    Many who are now calling for ""just"" air strikes on Serb  positions avoid these questions. Behind that there is the  double illusion that one can certainly do some good -- and worse  things will certainly not happen because of it.    A few air strikes -- everybody admits that -- can neither  end  nor shorten, nor really influence the war in Bosnia. It will  keep dragging on murderously, until one side wins, everybody is  exhausted, or political insight gains ground among all three  opponents at some time in the future. In the best case, the  atrocities will be committed differently and in different places  in Bosnia in the future, not so much in the limelight of the  media. Is this a serious objective of a war?    Everyone says that there is no real intention to wage war  there. In reality, however, something like ""a little bit of war""  does not exist. The result that could be achieved at best with  surgical air strikes, namely pushing certain combat actions out  of the world's awareness, must be weighed against the danger of  escalating and expanding the war. If the international  community undertakes just one direct military intervention in  the Bosnia war, it makes itself, the United Nations, or NATO a  direct party to the war. The UN troops, who are stationed in  the country without heavy weapons to provide humanitarian aid,  would continue to be unprotected targets of the Serbs. And what  then: withdrawal of the UN soldiers, an end to humanitarian  aid, leaving the war to itself? Or more air strikes, or even  ground forces sent to Bosnia? There is only one military action  that rules out the risk of further escalation -- and that is  victory. Whoever does not want to fight to win, should keep his  finger off the trigger.    Whoever wants to intervene in this war -- and be it only  with  ""surgical"" strikes, as some people imagine -- must be absolutely  clear about the purpose and meaning of the entire operation.  However, there is no clear goal of war. For what does Europe  want to fight, for what should it fight in the Balkans? The  noble phrase that the West will not recognize any borders that  have been changed by force has long become an outdated, empty  shell. No one is willing and able to reestablish the status quo  ante, the starting position, by use of armed force and with  acceptable casualties. Should the international community  instead get entangled in fighting for some version of the plans  for division, which are pointless anyway -- or for the  difference between two of them? And with whom and whose  behavior should it take sides -- with the Muslims, the Croats,  and the Serbs, every one of whom is tactically superior in  another place and at another time? To all these questions there  is no clear answer to justify a serious military intervention.  Whoever, instead, starts some air strikes himself acts  dangerously on the basis of that helplessness that he allegedly  wants to fight.    In this situation the West can have only three goals:    First: Preserving its own security. It is not endangered by  the war in Bosnia. It is also absurd to claim that NATO's  credibility is at stake. As regards its actual purpose,  self-defense in the alliance, Bosnia has never called it into  question. If at all, Bosnia casts doubt on the credibility of  new out-of-area goals.    Second: Containing the Balkan conflict. This is difficult  but possible. However, it would be made more difficult by  direct intervention in Bosnia. It is very likely that the  Russians would leave the coalition in the UN Security Council.    Third: Continuation of humanitarian aid. This is possible  only if the aid workers are not turned into combatants or  hostages of the warring parties -- e.g. through pointless  military actions by the West.    This is truly no heroic program. However, it is much more  realistic than the heroism of some tactical air strikes without  a strategic goal. Such a concept cannot pacify Bosnia -- and  cannot satisfy the world. After the peoples' spring of 1989 the  world must again adjust to the terrible realization that peoples  also wage war -- and to how horrible wars are in detail; to the  fact that there are, by the way, conflicts where one can help  and those where one cannot even act as a balancing influence;  and, above all, to the fact that, before taking any action, it  must be carefully determined what kind of conflict one is  dealing with.    A terrible war is raging in the Balkans -- one of many that  we usually like to ignore. Europe is helpless. This is true --  and it is depressing. However, how helpless it is would become  completely obviously only when it engaged in a military  intervention in this war just for the sake of pretense. And  then, only then, would Europe bear its own guilt -- for this  helplessness and for this war.     "

The ceremony was attended by the brother secretary of  justice  and public security, and by the ministers of interior, defense  and trade from the Chadian side. The head of the UN observers  also attended.    A joint declaration was issued on the occasion. It states  that the International Court of Justice issued its ruling on the  regional dispute between the Great Socialist People's Libyan  Arab Jamahiriyah and the Republic of Chad on 4 February, 1994,  and that in the realization that the Great Socialist People's  Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah and the Republic of Chad signed an  agreement on 4 April 1994 on ways to implement the  International's Court of Justice ruling, the Great Socialist  People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah and the Republic of Chad  declare that the withdrawal of the Libyan administration and  Libyan forces from the village of Aouzou is to begin on this  day, 30 May 1944, in a manner acceptable to both sides and is to  be made under the supervision of a UN observers' team.    This declaration was signed in the village of Aouzou today,  30 May 1994.    The brother secretary of the General People's Committee for  Justice and Public Order delivered a speech during the ceremony.  He underlined that although the name of Aouzou used to  represent a symbol for disunity, it can now be a symbol for the  consolidation of solidarity and the boosting of ties and links  between the two brotherly peoples in the Great Jamahiriyah and  Chad. He indicated that for almost half a century, the village  of Aouzou represented a symbol for a joint struggle to repel the  colonialist invaders.    In his speech, the brother secretary said that although the  colonialists did not settle in this land, they nevertheless  established their presence by way of drawing maps of the area.  The whole of Africa was a target for a deliberate and  provocative policy of division aimed at sowing disunity among  brothers and tearing apart the heroic bravery against  colonialism. This region, alongside other regions in Africa,  was part of this provocative division. To this day, other  African areas continue to suffer from this divisionist policy.    He added that the colonialists used to exaggerate and stress  this conflict between Libya and Chad, which hampered the march  of all our peoples in Africa, and diverted Africa's attention  from taking care of its matters and developing its resources.  Colonialism erected a barrier between the two countries, which  had a negative impact on cooperation between them. We are still  seeing this policy in a number of African regions.    However, today, and following the taking of this brave step  in opting to solve the conflict through peaceful means and  through the International Court of Justice, we are taking a  further heroic step, a step that shows our respect for the  verdict of the International Court of Justice, a step that some  so-called superpowers could not take.    Today, we give proof that solving a conflict can be reached  through peaceful methods; through more effective and beneficial  means. We show that whenever a judicial quarter specializing in  areas of conflict gives its verdict, irrespective of the point  of view expressed toward its decision, the parties should adhere  to this ruling. This method is the fundamental foundation for  establishing a new world order; the use of force, the imposition  of or threats to implement political and economic sanctions will  not provide solutions to the world's problems and difficulties.  The only method is to solve conflicts via peaceful ways and  through the UN Charter.    He added that the pronouncement of the verdict of the  International Court of Justice, especially in a case like this,  does not mean that there was a weak or a strong side, a victor  or a vanquished, a winner or a loser. It means that a legal  solution, irrespective of victory, defeat, gain or loss, had  been found which solves a long-standing conflict, and turns the  Sahara into what is was in the past: A land for harmonious ties  and stability.    He stressed that the Great Jamahiriyah is setting the ideal  example on respecting an important binding verdict, and that  there is no other way for other states other than to heed this  method for solving conflicts.

Faithful compatriots, the recent treacherous coup d'etat is  the continuation of a series of consistent crimes that have been  shaped by the enemies of Islam and our dear homeland outside the  country's borders and that have been implemented one by one by  treacherous elements and merciless murderers, the sworn enemies  of our nation. The defeat of this bloody conspiracy along with  its broad external and internal dimensions, is a gigantic  victory and a historic deed by self-sacrificing heroic mojahedin  and the wisdom of our new Islamic army. I congratulate the  faithful nation and brave mojahedin, who with unprecedented  courage stand in the trenches defending the soil of Islam and  their homeland, on this great victory. I express thanks and  gratitude to all leaders, the knowledgeable ulema, and dear  commanders who have played a historic role in the defeat of this  bloody coup d'etat and have supported the Islamic state. I  sincerely thank all the people of Kabul, who have welcomed  refugees from the affected areas; the state's services  commission; the Red Crescent; the International Red Cross; and  doctors and hospital personnel, who, with courage and sympathy,  have rendered services to the wounded, the disabled, and  refugees.    The Islamic state, while determined to uproot the reasons  for  the country's lack of stability in line with the wishes of the  people, [words indistinct] to violate shamefully the life,  property, and honor of the people, is ready to end the war with  the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], which  Hekmatyar, contrary to the will of its center of decision-making  and contrary to the will of its commanders, has unilaterally  participated in this bloody catastrophe. We believe the members  of Hezb-e Eslami are never desirous of war against their  colleagues-in-one-trench and mojahedin in the Islamic state. In  particular, after the recent conspiracy, no one in the Hezb-e  Eslami wants to stand against the [word indistinct] of faithful  mojahedin in the Islamic state and against the whole nation and  to be apparently those whose swords are with Yazid [person who  killed Prophet Mohammad's grandson Husayn in Karbala'] and their  hearts with Hosayn.    However, as far as it depends on the militia, the purging of  professional murderers and the centers of corruption and  savagery will continue until they surrender their weapons to the  Afghan nation.    The Islamic state warmly welcomes the sympathetic efforts of  leaders of the fraternal countries: Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the  Islamic Republic of Iran, the ICO [Islamic Conference  Organization] foreign ministers conference, and the UN, who are  making efforts toward the establishment of security and putting  an end to bloodshed in Afghanistan. Special envoys of the  Islamic state of Afghanistan have met and discussed this matter  with the leaders of the fraternal countries, Pakistan and Saudi  Arabia. A delegation will be sent soon to Tehran to gain the  cooperation of this fraternal neighboring country in solving our  problems, while thanking it for its goodwill efforts.    In the meantime the state sincerely welcomes all esteemed  circles in the country who are making efforts toward peace. We  hope their efforts bear fruit.    Concerning political changes in the country's future, this  point should not be left unsaid: The Islamic state never allows  conspirators to target the destiny of this nation for their  sinister aims through killing and murder. The people have  determined their political destiny through their presence within  the Resolution and Settlement Council [Shra-e Hal wa 'Aqd]. We  again give the right to the nation's representatives to appoint  their future leadership through a gathering or elections in line  with the country's special conditions.    We invite the ICO and UN representatives to take part in and  help us with the process of elections or any other process our  people choose. Peace be upon you. God be with you.     "

BAT's shares, too, have spluttered after the FDA attacked high-nicotine tobacco. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the latest row, the trend towards tighter regulation is unmistakable. BAT describes the FDA as an 'agency with an agenda' aiming 'to acquire jurisdiction over tobacco so that it can regulate it out of existence'. That makes its Dollars 1bn acquisition of American Tobacco appear all the more heroic - or foolhardy. BAT's shares have underperformed the market by 8 per cent since it moved to increase its exposure to US tobacco, although other unsettling factors have been at work. BAT has been hit by the dollar's weakness and it has only recently become apparent how badly Farmers was knocked by the Californian earthquake. Yet if BAT's tobacco worries are confined to the US, its rating looks decidedly mean. Its tobacco interests are valued on an earnings multiple of around five when insurance is given a market rating. That may only reinforce the logic of hiving off tobacco, even though Philip Morris has just baulked at the idea. After all, cigarette sales in the developing world should more than offset shrinking US demand.   Companies:-  BAT Industries.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

What took the Ventura County Fire Department so long to  respond? The nearest fire station is only three minutes away.    But it seems that all its men and equipment were busy elsewhere at a training  drill.    Once they did arrive, more time was wasted as they suited up and prepared hose  lines. From our observation, no aggressive action was taken to suppress the  fire, only to confine it to that structure. Why?    The adjacent home was spared through the heroic efforts of a neighbor, an  off-duty city fireman, who stayed on that roof watering it down until the Fire  Department had hose lines going.

What took the Ventura County Fire Department so long to  respond? The nearest fire station is only three minutes away.    But it seems that all its men and equipment were busy elsewhere at a training  drill.    Once they did arrive, more time was wasted as they suited up and prepared hose  lines. From our observation, no aggressive action was taken to suppress the  fire, only to confine it to that structure. Why?    The adjacent home was spared through the heroic efforts of a neighbor, an  off-duty city fireman, who stayed on that roof watering it down until the Fire  Department had hose lines going.

The Swedish government might have a valuable contribution to make in the efforts to improve the communication between the EC citizens and the EC governing bodies. In Sweden all government acts are made public unless specifically stamped 'secret'. And the label 'secret' may only be applied to specific sections of a document, containing information regarding commercial secrets, defence secrets and matters concerning personal integrity of individuals. This, among other things, means that the Swedish public and Swedish journalists can walk into any government agency and demand to see today's mail or to look at any specific act kept in the agency. This principle of public acts might seem shocking to many politicians and bureaucrats who are used to the opposite principle  - that all public acts are kept secret unless specifically made public. But I would point out that the system has worked well for 200 years and has greatly contributed to making Swedish government virtually free of corruption.

In  him, we can find traces of heroic fighting during wartime, the  quality of an exemplary worker, and a struggling and aggressive  character. The stunning and moving achievements he made in  leading the people of Xiadingjia through arduous efforts have  long been widely known on the agricultural fronts all over the  country. Not long ago, comrade Ai Qi, my old comrade-in-arms  and an author, gathered material, despite his old age, in the  mountainous areas of eastern Shandong and wrote down what he saw  and heard there and completed the book. After reading it, I  acclaim it and have mixed feelings.    Using detailed facts, the book illustrates how the  protagonist killed his enemies, made achievements, and then  vowed to pioneer a cause back home; how he bought a donkey for a  generously high price and engaged in war in adverse conditions  among the hills and rivers; how he made reforms and brought  forth new ideas and led the masses in a struggle to get rich.  This enables people to know the broad-mindedness and courage of  this unyielding old soldier and this undaunted man. The book  also tells with subtleness touching stories about him including  how he did not hang on to his achievements but would rather  become a peasant, how well he has strictly taught his children,  how he has remained uncorrupted, and how he withdrew to the  second front and how his remaining enthusiasm burned. This  enables us to feel deeply how he has worked selflessly for the  public interest and what lofty ideals he has by keeping his  hands clean, and how he has closely integrated himself with the  masses, and how he has harmoniously integrated his career and  life. All this is usual and lofty, respectable and credible.    As an ideal, Comrade Wang Yongxing and the people of  Xiadingjia reflect the spiritual outlook of China's 800 million  peasants; that is, they ardently love the party, the country,  the troops, and firm socialist beliefs; and that they have the  heroic courage of pioneering a cause and struggling  courageously, they have the aggressive spirit of being devoted  to reform and bringing forth new ideas and the fine virtues of  considering the situation as a whole and making a sacrifice  sincerely.... This is the supremely lofty soul of the Chinese  people and is the motivation rallying the people's support and  invigorating China.    The PLA is a great army. Over the past 60 years or more,  tens of thousands of youths with lofty ideas have been steeled  in this revolutionary cauldron. They have made indelible  contributions to the liberation of the Chinese people and to  construction. Comrade Wang Yongxing is a good example of  demobilized and handicapped servicemen and is a piece of good  steel from the cauldron of the army. Countless people like Wang  Yongxing have added glory to the army and have sacrificed for  the country with unlimited loyalty to the party and full ardor  and sincerity. One can see from them that our Army's glorious  traditions are being carried forward on all fronts and have  become a bright torch reflecting on the Great Wall of steel.    People who have been through the years of war deeply realize  that in order to struggle for national liberation and national  independence, it is necessary to endure countless dangers and  difficulties and blood-and-fire tests and to pay the cost of  sacrificing oneself and forgetting about death. Today, the  great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  under the party's leadership presents extremely heavy and  arduous tasks and still demands that we pioneer a cause  arduously and struggle continuously. The publication of the  book will offer people vivid teaching material so they can have  a strong belief in the party's leadership, have strong trust in  socialist beliefs, and carry forward the glorious traditions.  From it, we can absorb political nutrients, cultivate our  morals, arouse the revolutionary spirit, overcome all  difficulties, and proceed from success to success with full  confidence in our hearts.    What needs mentioning is that the author comrade Ai Qi was a  former serviceman. Since retirement, he has devoted himself to  the great tide of reform and construction by writing  courageously and ardently. This persistent spirit is valuable  and deserves praising. I sincerely congratulate the publication  of the book and look forward to the publication of more new  works by comrade Ai Qi.     "

John Greenwood, chief economist of the GT fund management group, gets a special mention in dispatches for his sterling work during a particularly nasty run on the Hong Kong dollar 10 years ago. Local shops had begun posting signs that they would accept only US dollars and nobody had much of a clue how to solve the crisis. No one, that is, apart from Greenwood who had published a paper on 'How to rescue the Hong Kong dollar', which he had circulated to economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. One Saturday afternoon, at the height of the crisis, he was invited to the Hong Kong monetary affairs department to discuss his plan. Greenwood came away thinking that he hadn't convinced the officials of his case. However, a few days later, HK followed his advice, pegged its exchange rate, and the HK government won all the credit. 'For my money Greenwood deserved a knighthood,' says Cottrell, who is already researching his next tome, a biography of President Mitterrand.   Countries:-  HKZ  Hong Kong, Asia.

On this very day, the invading  and aggressive forces continued their desperate attacks on all  fronts. Our brave Armed Forces intercepted them, and inflicted  on them further losses in lives, vehicles, and other military  equipment.    In the Tawr al-Bahah zone, our forces succeeded in mopping  up  the infiltrating hostile forces, which were engaged in acts of  looting, robbery, and rape. Our forces are in the process of  imposing their control over the situation, after combing a  number of villages and towns for the routed remnants of the  hostile forces. On this front the enemy's losses were four  tanks, two Katyusha launchers, and hundreds of dead and wounded.  A large number of the enemy's men surrendered, including  numerous members of the infamous and disreputable jihad elements.    Our forces continue, in the provinces of Radfan and al-Dali'  -- after thousands of people joined them from the province of  Yafi and other provinces -- to cleanse the villages of the filth  of the routed remnants of the hostile forces.    In the Abyan zone our forces destroyed three Katyusha launch  vehicles and seized two hostile tanks. The combat actions of  our forces were characterized by determination, death-defying  action, a firm defense, and high combat morale. The enemy's  acts were characterized by barbarousness, randomness, and  desperation, especially after they realized that the ruling  military regime in Sanaa insists on continuing to challenge the  international community, and on shedding the blood of thousands  of the sons of the central areas, who have no control over their  fates and are pushed toward the holocaust of war and death.    God is great, God is great.     "

The attacks increased by 22 in comparison with the  November figure but, fortunately, the death toll declined by  eight. Of the total victims, 16 belonged to the civilian sector,  12 were presumed subversives, four were members of the Police  Forces [FFPP], and two were from the Armed Forces [FFAA].    December was marked by two commemorative dates, which were  the occasions of heightened Shining Path [SL] activity. The  first was another birthday of Abimael Guzman, followed by the  SL's promised celebration of the centennial of Mao Tse-tung's  birth. They occurred at the beginning and end of the month,  respectively.    Lima again ranked first insofar as attacks were concerned. A  total of 37 acts of political violence (64 percent) were  committed in the capital: that is, 17 more acts than in the  previous month.    A day before Abimael Guzman's birthday, the SL's caused a  minor blackout in the capital and in other zones of the country,  sabotaging part of the Mantaro interconnected system for this  purpose. In conjunction with the blackout, the subversives  detonated some explosives in at least three Lima districts.    Ranking second for attacks was the Northern regional  committee, with 10 subversive acts (17 percent). The number of  attacks rose by seven compared with the previous month's figure.  Three of these acts involved confrontations between the forces  of order and the subversive columns. Two of these clashes  occurred in the Chavin region, and the third in Sanchez Carrion  Province, in the La Libertad sierra region.    The Central regional committee ranked third, with five  attacks (9 percent): the same number of acts of political  violence as during November. Two of these incidents involved  assaults upon vehicles on highways, another was a confrontation,  the fourth was sabotage against high voltage towers, and the  last, a selective assassination.    Fourth place for attacks was tied between the Jungle and  Southern regions, each of which had two acts (3 percent). In the  Jungle the attacks declined by six, and in the South they  increased by two.    Last place for attacks was taken by the Principal region,  with one subversive act involving sabotage against electric  power facilities.    As for victims, the Lima regional committee also ranked  first, with 17 persons killed (50 percent). Two of these deaths  were selective assassinations of popular leaders: one, a member  of the Huayacan patrols, and the other, a general secretary of a  human settlement in Chorrillos.    However, the incident with the most bloodshed occurred  during  the attack on the Bank of the Nation branch in El Agustino, in  which three policemen, five civilians, and one subversive were  killed.    Ranking second for victims was the Northern regional  committee, with eight (24 percent). Five of these deaths were  Shining Path casualties in a confrontation with a police patrol  in Mariscal Luzuriaga Province. In an invasion, the subversives  assassinated a lieutenant governor as well.    The Central regional committee ranked third, with seven  victims (20 percent). Six of these deaths occurred during a  confrontation between an Army patrol and an MRTA [Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement] group in La Merced. Five subversives and  one soldier were killed in the clash.    The Jungle region ranked last, with two deaths (6 percent).  One of the incidents was the subversives' assassination of the  wife of a municipal councilman from Amarilis, and the other was  the death of a member of the police at the hands of an MRTA  group.

0,FT932-13951 ,"FT932-13951 _AN-DDUCWAEDFT 930421   FT  21 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy   March's record public sector borrowing - Pounds 11bn excluding privatisation receipts - is a truly heroic effort. A decade ago, such a total for the year as a whole would have been a disaster. Yesterday the gilt market barely blinked. Such insouciance will only be justified if March turns out to be a one-off. Cash limits encourage departments to spend unused cash before the financial year-end. In 1992-93, buying from outside contractors may have proved more cost-effective than expected, leaving more cash looking for a home. But if so, why did the chancellor have no inkling of it when he delivered a much lower estimate in the Budget five weeks ago? Until now, the markets have assumed that the chancellor's prediction of a Pounds 50bn budget deficit for 1993-94 was deliberately pessimistic. That may prove a false expectation. The overshoot last year also means that the Treasury has pre-funded less of this year's borrowings than first thought. While the government will doubtless get the debt away, it cannot afford attacks of nerves if it is to sell gilts at current yields. Its prospects are not improved by the Bank of England opportunistically auctioning stock at any maturity. Issues aimed at the banks, and a tough spending round, will be more persuasive.

0,FT944-518 ,"FT944-518 _AN-EL1B9ABPFT 941228   FT  28 DEC 94 / Record industry's heart develops healthier beat: The new Beatles album is just one of the reasons why sales have rebounded      By ALICE RAWSTHORN   Executives of EMI Records knew they had a hit on their hands last month when they launched a rare Beatles recording, Live At The BBC. But they never thought it would sell nearly 1m copies in its first month. Live At The BBC is not the only success on the UK music scene. Album and singles sales rose by 12.5 per cent in the year to October, according to the British Phonographic Industry. Early estimates suggest Christmas sales could be 20 per cent up on last year. Record companies are also basking in the success of UK acts - such as Take That, East 17, Blur, Oasis and Eternal - in the continental European market. This rosy picture could not be more different from that of a few years ago when the industry was mired in recession and haunted by legal and regulatory problems. The music market declined steadily in the early 1990s with album sales falling from 163m in 1989 to 134m by 1992, British Phonographic Industry statistics show. The record companies also faced the dual threat of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into compact disc pricing and the legal attempt by George Michael, the singer, to end his contract with Sony. These threats have evaporated. The MMC found in the industry's favour and George Michael lost his case. The latest probe into the music business - the MMC's investigation into the Performing Right Society, the body that collects royalties for composers - will not affect the record companies. The economic environment has also improved. Music is traditionally a leading indicator, emerging from recession earlier than other consumer sectors, and its recovery from the early 1990s recession has been accelerated by other factors such as demographic trends and technological changes. The growth in the number of teenagers, the prime purchasers of singles, has triggered a revival in teen phenomena such as Take That and East 17. Both bands have had a string of hits and become the most successful teen acts since David Cassidy, the Osmonds and the Bay City Rollers back in the 1970s. The record companies have also invested in new alternative acts such as Oasis and Blur. These bands have more critical kudos than Take That and East 17, which might help them to last longer. They have also enjoyed healthy sales. Blur's Parklife album has sold 500,000 copies since its September debut. The jungle dance craze which started in the London clubs has been bombarded by media attention in the US and UK. Record companies have been signing up jungle acts in the expectation that it will become a commercial phenomenon next year. Meanwhile the industry continues to benefit from increased sales to age groups which grew up in the vibrant pop culture of the 1960s and 1970s. Some of the most successful 1994 releases have been aimed at this age group. REM's Monster sold 200,000 copies in its first week - more than any album for five years - when it came out in September. The 'greatest hits' compilations by Bon Jovi and the Beautiful South have been among the best-sellers this Christmas. Live At The BBC is even better news for retailers, as it attracts older consumers who do not normally buy albums. EMI's compact disc plant has been working round-the-clock to satisfy demand. Mr Brian McLaughlin, managing director of the HMV chain, said his shops were still selling 'as many copies as we can lay our hands on'. The popularity of compact disc players is also boosting music sales. Some 40 per cent of UK homes now have compact disc machines and consumers are replacing their record collections by buying old favourites on disc, increasing sales of classic rock, jazz and classical music. The outlook is even brighter on the international front. UK acts are well-established on the Continent and are starting to regain the ground they lost in the US in the early 1990s due to the popularity of American phenomena such as country music, rap and grunge rock. Country and grunge are waning, making it easier for UK acts to make their mark in the US, by far the world's largest pop market.

He said his party does not wish to exploit the current  differences between the two parties to obtain seats of power in  the country.    In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his residence in  Sanaa,  Shaykh al-Zanadani said that the YSP wants to internationalize  the Yemeni crisis and move it from the House of Representatives  to the international community. He clarified that the YAR, the  third member of the coalition in the government, wants to keep  the Yemeni issue in the hands of its sons. It does not want the  dispute to go outside Arab circles for a solution.    The Presidential Council member noted that his party insists  on telling the truth, a step that does not satisfy either of the  sides to the dispute. We demand that the people's will be  respected in accordance with the Pledge and Accord Document. We  call for presenting all our issues before the House of  Representatives to discuss them and pass the resolutions that  bind all sides.    On the conflict between the GPC and the YSP regarding how to  implement the document, in which the YSP is demanding that those  charged in the assassinations be arrested first, he said that  his party supports the GPC on the need to merge the state  institutions before arresting the defendants, especially since  the government is a coalition between three parties.    Responding to a question on the role the YAR could play in  arresting the suspects in the assassinations, he said we always  stand by the truth and do not accuse anyone. We demand a fair  trial and the elimination of political influences on decisions.  He affirmed that the road to power can only be through the  ballot box.    Regarding the various accusations that the YAR practices  terrorism, he said: I am one of those who experienced an  assassination attempt and acts of terrorism before the  parliamentary elections. However, the current conflict prompted  some sides, especially the YSP, to exploit the issue of  terrorism, in particular with some Arab countries that do not  know the facts behind the conflict in Yemen. The truth is that  there are political and tribal conflicts and that a state of  vengeance exists between the YSP in the south and a number of  citizens whose sons, brothers, and family members were killed.  Therefore, the problem of revenge will continue to be a time  bomb in Yemen if it is not wisely handled.    He noted that the YAR presented a proposal for resolving the  problem of vengeance in Yemen. The proposal includes signing an  agreement and issuing a decision on stopping Yemeni bloodshed  and then setting a date for a general pardon of past incidents.  All the chapters of vengeful acts before this date will be  closed and the national interests of Yemen will be promoted  henceforth.    All murders and acts of revenge that take place after that  date will fall under Islamic laws and punishments.    Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani denied accusations that he  harbors terrorism and heads the military wing of the YAR. He  said that there were some youths who were very religious and  found out that some people in Aden were behaving in an  un-Islamic manner. They found out, for example, that there is an  alcoholic beverage plant in Aden and that the police killed  demonstrators in the al-Rahman mosque in Aden. As a result,  some of these youths adopted violence as a course. Moreover,  the YAR advised them to follow peaceful means to find out the  truth and handle the situation. Some of them heeded our call  and returned to the path of righteousness.    He said that Usamah Bin-Ladin [prominent Saudi businessman]  has a group who follow him and carry out some terrorist acts.  But some of them regained their senses and backed out of the  acts they were supposed to commit.    He clarified that the Islamic nation is torn between two  cultures. The first is the culture of decline, which has  distorted Islam. The second is the culture of colonialism,  which casts doubts over Islam. This is why we all have to work  on protecting the fierce onslaught against Islam.    The member of the Presidential Council affirmed the absence  of an armed wing in the YAR. He said the Yemeni people are  armed anyway. However, we do not call for reform through weapons  and killing, but through wisdom and sound advice.    On acts of terrorism in Egypt and accusations that he  supports them and harbors some of the Egyptian terrorist groups  in Yemen, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani said: I love Egypt  and lived there for quite some time. This is why I cannot carry  out terrorist acts against it. What harms our Egypt, harms us  also. We wish it all the best. We are ready to fully cooperate  with it to annihilate terrorism, which is hiding behind the veil  of the true Islamic religion.    He said that Yemen is too small to be a source for exporting  terrorism to fraternal Egypt.    Regarding the presence of a terrorist camp that he allegedly  patronizes in the region of Sa'dah in the north supervised by  Shaykh Muqbil, the Presidential Council member said that he does  not order people to carry weapons; he fights violence and  terrorism. We have recorded tapes of Shaykh Muqbil in which he  condemns terrorism. He added: I informed Ambassador 'Ata'  Harun, the ambassador from Egypt to Yemen, that we are ready to  welcome the visit by any Egyptian official to the headquarters  of Shaykh Muqbil in Sa'dah to learn about his school that  teaches the Koran and the true religion and whose students are  from various nationalities who wish to learn about Islam. It is  not a camp for exporting terrorism.    Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani concluded his speech: We do  not approve the principle of change through force and the use of  violence and terrorism. At the same time, we cannot allow Yemen  to be a country from which Egypt is harmed.     "

The decision will be  incorporated in a basic guideline for a deregulation promotion  program, which will be compiled by the government in June. The  government adopted a system of controlling export goods in the  late 1950's in an effort to promote credibility of Japanese  products. However, it has decided to withdraw such regulation  because quality of Japanese products has been improved. The  government also intends to demonstrate the shift of its trade  policies both at home and abroad by abolishing these acts which  have been regarded as a symbol of joint efforts by the  government and the private sector to promote exports.    The three acts to be abolished are: the export inspection  act; the export goods design act; and the unified trademark act  on products of small export enterprises. Under the export  inspection act, enterprises which export designated products are  obligated to undergo inspection of quality of their products.  The export goods design act requires registration of design and  trademarks of export products. Under the unified trademark act  on products of small export enterprises, the government  formulates trademarks for products of small enterprises and  guarantees quality of their goods. Firms which export designated  products have to pay inspection and certification fees to  inspection organs.    MITI plans to hold a meeting of the Export-Import  Transaction  Council on 15 April and a meeting of the Export Inspection and  Design Council in May to obtain their consent for its decision  to abolish these three acts. It will promote coordination on  plans to gradually decrease items subject to the export  inspection act and the design act beginning this fiscal year and  to submit a bill on abolishing these acts to an ordinary Diet  session in 1997. A bill on abolishing the unified trademark act  on products of small export enterprises will be incorporated in  a package bill on deregulation which is to be submitted to the  current Diet session.

The sources said  that among these countries is Sudan, which is ruled by General  'Umar al-Bashir.

(1) Claims based upon a single act or incident cognizable under this subpart and subparts H or K will be first considered under the latter chapters; if not payable under any of those chapters, the claim will be considered under this chapter.     (2) A claim may not be paid under this chapter if it is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act (subpart E) or the Foreign Claims Act (subpart J). (See 10 U.S.C. 2733(b)(2)).     (3) Where a Status of Forces Agreement or other agreement provides for host country adjudication of a claim, the treaty process may be the claimants exclusive remedy (see subpart G). Where a foreign country is responsible for adjudication of the claim under the terms of such an agreement, it may not be paid under the provisions of this chapter. If the foreign country refuses to recognize legal responsibility for the claim, or to consider it under applicable treaty provisions, the chief of a command claims service or, where the estimated value of the claim is within USARCS authority, the Commander, USARCS may authorize adjudication of the claim under this chapter.

(i) If the primary cognizable act or incident upon which the claim is based is not cognizable under subpart D, the claim may be considered and paid under this chapter. However, the settlement agreement must expressly release the United States from any further liability under the FTCA or any other statute or regulation for all acts or incidents upon which the claim was based. If the claim is over $25,000, any proposed settlement will be coordinated with USARCS prior to final action.     (ii) If the primary cognizable act or incident upon which the claim is based is cognizable under subpart D, the claim will be first considered under subpart D. If the claim is determined by proper authority to be nonmeritorious under subpart D but meritorious under this subpart (for example, negligence occurred overseas but none occurred in the United States or there is no negligence in the conduct of a noncombat activity), it may be considered and paid under this subpart. However, an agreed settlement must be reached that expressly releases the United States from further liability under the FTCA or any other statute or regulation for all acts or incidents upon which the claim was based. If the claim was presented in an amount over $25,000, any proposed settlement will be coordinated with USARCS.     (2)     Nonmeritorious claims.     Where claims are based upon multiple acts or incidents, some or all of which may be cognizable under subpart D (FTCA), extreme care will be taken prior to any disapproval based upon this chapter. Whether a claim is covered by Cognizability under the FTCA is a litigable issue. Such claims will be disapproved under this chapter only as follows:       (i) A claim presented in an amount not over $25,000, may be disapproved by an office with settlement authority having jurisdiction over the claim only if the claim is determined to be nonmeritorious under both this subpart and subpart D; however the disapproval procedures established in subpart D must be fully satisfied. In such cases, the disapproval notification will advise the claimant of his or her concurrent rights to appeal the disapproval under this subpart or to institute suit under the FTCA. (See 536.63.) In case of doubt concerning the applicability of this paragraph, the question will be referred to USARCS.    (ii) Claims of the type covered by this paragraph, which are presented in an amount over $25,000, will be disapproved only by the USARCS.     (c)     Claims in litigation.     Disposition under this chapter of any claim of the type covered by this paragraph that goes into litigation in any State or Federal court under any State or Federal statute or ordinance will be suspended pending disposition of such litigation, and the claim file will be forwarded to USARCS. The Commander, USARCS, in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice, may determine that final disposition under this chapter during pendency of the litigation is in the best interests of the United States. This paragraph will also apply to any litigation brought against any agent of the United States in his or her individual capacity that is based upon the same acts or incidents upon which a claim under the chapter is based.         536.53     Presentation of claim.        (a)     When claim must be presented.     A claim may be settled under this chapter only if presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues. If a claim accrues in time of war or armed conflict, or if war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after it accrues, and if good cause is shown, the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after war or armed conflict is terminated. As used in this paragraph, a war or armed conflict is one in which any Armed Force of the United States is engaged. The dates of commencement and termination of an armed conflict must be established by concurrent resolution of Congress or by determination of the President.

The preceding sentence is not applicable to claims involving registered or insured mail. No allowance will be made for any item when the evidence indicates that the acquisition, possession, or transportation thereof was in violation of DA directives.     (g) Is for rent, damage, or other payments involving the acquisition, use, possession, or disposition of real property or interests therein by and for the DA, except as authorized by 536.50(b).

When a claim is considered to be not payable for the reasons stated in this paragraph, it will be forwarded for appropriate action to the Commander, USARCS, together with the recommendations of the responsible claims office.     (i) Is presented by a national, or a corporation controlled by a national, of a country at war or engaged in armed conflict with the United States, or any country allied with such enemy country unless the appropriate settlement authority determines that the claimant is and, at the time of the incident, was friendly to the United States. A prisoner of war or an interned enemy alien is not excluded as to a claim for damage, loss, or destruction of personal property in the custody of the Government otherwise payable.

(1) Claims based upon a single act or incident cognizable under this subpart and subparts H or K will be first considered under the latter chapters; if not payable under any of those chapters, the claim will be considered under this chapter.     (2) A claim may not be paid under this chapter if it is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act (subpart E) or the Foreign Claims Act (subpart J). (See 10 U.S.C. 2733(b)(2)).     (3) Where a Status of Forces Agreement or other agreement provides for host country adjudication of a claim, the treaty process may be the claimants exclusive remedy (see subpart G). Where a foreign country is responsible for adjudication of the claim under the terms of such an agreement, it may not be paid under the provisions of this chapter. If the foreign country refuses to recognize legal responsibility for the claim, or to consider it under applicable treaty provisions, the chief of a command claims service or, where the estimated value of the claim is within USARCS authority, the Commander, USARCS may authorize adjudication of the claim under this chapter. The mere fact a foreign country fails to pay the claims on its merits is not sufficient basis for invoking this authority.     (b)     Claims based upon multiple acts or theories of liability.     Where claims cognizable under this chapter are based upon more than one act or injury and where one or more of the acts or injuries are also cognizable under the FTCA (subpart D) (for example, claims alleging acts of medical malpractice both in a foreign country and in the United States or claims alleging negligence in the conduct of a noncombat activity), the claims will be processed as follows:     (1)     Meritorious claims.     (i) If the primary cognizable act or incident upon which the claim is based is not cognizable under subpart D, the claim may be considered and paid under this chapter. However, the settlement agreement must expressly release the United States from any further liability under the FTCA or any other statute or regulation for all acts or incidents upon which the claim was based. If the claim is over $25,000, any proposed settlement will be coordinated with USARCS prior to final action.     (ii) If the primary cognizable act or incident upon which the claim is based is cognizable under subpart D, the claim will be first considered under subpart D. If the claim is determined by proper authority to be nonmeritorious under subpart D but meritorious under this subpart (for example, negligence occurred overseas but none occurred in the United States or there is no negligence in the conduct of a noncombat activity), it may be considered and paid under this subpart. However, an agreed settlement must be reached that expressly releases the United States from further liability under the FTCA or any other statute or regulation for all acts or incidents upon which the claim was based. If the claim was presented in an amount over $25,000, any proposed settlement will be coordinated with USARCS.     (2)     Nonmeritorious claims.

LE MONDE recently cried for a ""special inspection"" of the  DPRK, claiming that a ""decisive attitude of the international  community"" should be shown.    This is a pernicious propaganda aimed at casting a chill  over  the agreement between the DPRK and the IAEA. It reveals the  sinister intention of France to force ""special inspection"" upon  the DPRK and take international ""sanctions"" and pressure against  it.    As was already reported, the afore-said agreement has been  unanimously welcomed by world public opinion as affirmative  developments for a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    France, however, is obtrusively crying for a ""decisive  attitude of the international community,"" ignoring the unbiased  opinion. This is not only an intolerable challenge to us but a  criminal act to arrest the affirmative developments provided  with so much efforts.    Some time ago, the French foreign minister and the Foreign  Ministry spokesman argued that the DPRK's ""nuclear issue"" should  be ""examined"" by the United Nations Security Council. France  has called for ""sanctions"" more than once against the DPRK to  isolate and stifle it, in league with the U.S. right-wing  conservative forces, Japan and the South Korean puppets.    Such persistent moves of France against the DPRK are  apparently aimed at finding a pretext for resuming its nuclear  test, charging the DPRK with the fictitious ""nuclear issue.""    They are also motivated by its wicked design to encourage  the  United States, a dialogue partner of the DPRK, to confrontation  with us to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, cause a military conflict  in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula, profit from a  massive sale of destructive military equipment and strengthen  relations with the South Korean puppets.    We take a serious view of the criminal acts pursued by the  French wuthorities to stifle the DPRK.    If France continues to resort to such insidious acts without  discretion, it would drink a bitter cup.    France would be well advised to clearly see the situation,  ponder over the matter and promptly stop such wicked acts as  doing harm to others.     "

To those who were at the forefront of the masses who on  22 May 1990 shouted long live the unity, and raised the banner  of unity and democracy, and wiped out the partition and its  deplorable remnants.    To the fathers, brothers and sons; to the mothers and  sisters, we ask you to take a firm, unwavering stand against the  barbaric trap that has been set for you by the secessionist  elements in the Socialist Party. Beware of them and know that  the Armed Forces and security forces are your own forces, the  forces of constitutional legitimacy, the protectors of unity and  democracy. Therefore, these forces are to be trusted in caring  for your life, security, and stability because they are  responsible for the life of the entire people. Therefore, we  are confident that you will always be with them, especially  today when they are embarking on the heroic path and confronting  the latest chapter in the plot of the secessionist gang, which  the is taking of the tranquil life in Aden as a trench to  protect it from the just punishment of heaven and from people's  will. This gang is endeavoring to drag the Yemeni Armed Forces  into storming this trench at the expense of your security and  stability, a thing which this gang failed to realize, thanks to  the astuteness of the political leadership of brother Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential  Council and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, who has  been issuing firm instructions to the Armed Forces' brave  brigades and battalions and to the splendid men of the  homeland's protectors that they should not be dragged into the  plot prepared by the sanguinary elements of the Socialist Party,  which aim to destroy the proud city of Aden in the wake of their  utter and expected defeat.    O free brothers, you are aware of the secessionist gang's  hatred toward Aden and its inhabitants. You are aware that this  sanguinary plot is an extension of the policy of destruction  that the Socialist Party devils led on 13 January 1986. That is  why we appeal to you to take the initiative, foil the plot, and  join the trench of defending unity and democracy under the  fluttering banner of constitutional legitimacy, and to face the  secessionist gangs firmly, bravely, with conviction, and with an  unwavering stand.    We appeal to you to rob all those who rebel against  constitutional legitimacy at any opportunity and to extend all  kinds of support and backing to your heroic sons of the Yemeni  Armed Forces, who will uproot the elements of apostasy and  secession with God's backing and your support. They will  eliminate those who endanger the homeland and bargain at the  expense of the supreme people's interests.    O free brothers, let the people's will, which is the will of  justice, proceed with daring, strength, and capability. Let  your cry roar and let us work together along the same path to  save the unionist city of Aden from the secessionist plot so  that it will remain safe and free and an honorable landmark of  the new Yemeni homeland, which now belongs to the procession of  the free world, thanks to its unity and democracy.    Accursed be the plotters, the enemies of God and the people,  the enemies of unity and democracy, and the enemies of life and  democracy.     "

Nevertheless, the figures that have been now released by  the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] are anything  but comforting. In a confidential study, the Wiesbaden-based  BKA talks of a reduction ""on a high level.""    With 540 politically motivated attacks, 1993 was once again  closer to the figures for 1991 (537 attacks) following the  horrific year 1992 (901 attacks). A return to the reasonable  levels of 1990, which saw ""only"" 128 violent attacks of this  kind cannot be expected for the time being, say the  criminologists.    The most serious crimes were committed by right-wing and  left-wing extremists: On 29 May 1993, four young neo-Nazis set  fire to the home of a large Turkish family in Solingen, causing  two deaths and serious injuries to eight of the occupants. Two  months before that, early in the morning of 27 March, the new  Hesse prison in Wieterstadt, which cost 130 million German marks  to build, was blown up by members of the RAF [Red Army Faction].    According to BKA findings, extremist right-wing motives  (both  acts aimed directly at left-wing groupings and various acts  involving hostility toward foreigners) were behind 300 of the  540 attacks. This means that attacks carried out by right-wing  extremists are still the main problem.    The extremist left carried out 150 arson and bomb attacks.  Their targets were political opponents, the police, the state,  and the bourgeoisie.    The left-wing arsonists stronghold is Berlin. In the capital  city alone, ""antifascists"" and ""anticapitalists"" carried out 69  attacks as part of campaigns, such as that directed against  ""Olympia 2000."" The BKA has identified a further large group of  arsonists and bombers among radical foreigners.    Of the 90 attacks carried out in 1993 by radical foreigners,  the majority can be attributed to Kurds linked to the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. The potential for ""politically  motivated crimes committed by foreigners"" remained the same as  in 1992.    There was a significant decline in the number of criminal  acts motivated by animosity toward foreigners. In new laender  above all, the number of attacks fell by 75 percent.    The greatest praise was earned by the Thuringians, who were  the most peaceful, followed by Saarland and Bavaria.     "

According to the news  magazine FOCUS, this is what the Federal Office of Criminal  Investigations (BKA) has noted in a confidential study.  According to investigations, experts noted a decline of attacks  ""at a high level,"" since attacks went from 901 in 1992 to 540 in  1993. A return to the situation in 1990 with 128 acts of  violence of this kind cannot be expected, however, experts think.    According to BKA findings, 300 attacks last year were  motivated by right-wing extremism. A total of 150 acts of  violence were committed by radical foreigners. According to the  BKA, xenophobic actions have declined clearly. In some of the  new laender, this kind of crime went down by 75 percent. In  1993 the most peaceful laender were Thuringia, Bavaria, and  Saarland.     "

In a  response to a grand inquiry by Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP] on the topic ""situation of Young People in  Germany,"" approved by the Cabinet in Bonn yesterday, FRG Youth  Minister Angela Merkel said that, on the one hand, this is due  to the demographic development. On the other, the youth courts  refrain from sentencing the culprits in particular in case of  less serious crime and use other kinds of punishment.    According to the criminal prosecution statistics, the number  of young people sentenced for theft and embezzlement declined  from 41,809 in 1982 to 16,528 in 1991. The number of young  people sentenced for acts of violence has also declined--from  8,799 by one-third to 5,937.    FRG Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger  (FDP)  expressed concern about the ""alarmingly high involvement of  young people in acts of violence with right-wing extremist  motives and xenophobic crimes."" The share of young people up to  20 years of age in acts of violence with proven or suspected  right-wing extremist motives amounted to about 69 percent in  1991 and 67 percent in 1992. From January 1991 to April 1992  alone this share amounted to 75 percent, the minister reported.  She stressed that, from the viewpoint of the Federal  Government, the current criminal law relating to young offenders  is sufficient also to punish right-wing extremist violent  crimes. A general tightening of the law is not intended. For  serious crimes committed by young people a prison term of up to  10 years is possible. However, this statutory punishment is  hardly ever imposed.    The Cabinet was also presented with figures on young drug  addicts and alcoholics. The proportion of young alcoholics  between 18 and 24 years of about 2.5 million alcoholics is 4.6  percent among men and 3.7 percent among women in the old  laender. For the new laender there is information available  only on the proportion of male alcoholics in this age group,  which is 3.1 percent.    The proportion of opiate-addicted young people in the old  laender is 30 percent of all drug addicts among men and 4  percent among women. For young people addicted to  pharmaceuticals the figures are 23 and 14.7 percent respectively.     "

Nevertheless, the figures that have been now released by  the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] are anything  but comforting. In a confidential study, the Wiesbaden-based  BKA talks of a reduction ""on a high level.""    With 540 politically motivated attacks, 1993 was once again  closer to the figures for 1991 (537 attacks) following the  horrific year 1992 (901 attacks). A return to the reasonable  levels of 1990, which saw ""only"" 128 violent attacks of this  kind cannot be expected for the time being, say the  criminologists.    The most serious crimes were committed by right-wing and  left-wing extremists: On 29 May 1993, four young neo-Nazis set  fire to the home of a large Turkish family in Solingen, causing  two deaths and serious injuries to eight of the occupants. Two  months before that, early in the morning of 27 March, the new  Hesse prison in Wieterstadt, which cost 130 million German marks  to build, was blown up by members of the RAF [Red Army Faction].    According to BKA findings, extremist right-wing motives  (both  acts aimed directly at left-wing groupings and various acts  involving hostility toward foreigners) were behind 300 of the  540 attacks. This means that attacks carried out by right-wing  extremists reman the main problem.    The extremist left carried out 150 arson and bomb attacks.  Their targets were political opponents, the police, the state,  and the bourgeoisie.    The left-wing arsonists stronghold is Berlin. In the capital  city alone, ""anti-fascists"" and ""anti-capitalists"" carried out  69 attacks as part of campaigns, such as that directed against  ""Olympia 2000."" The BKA has identified a further large group of  arsonists and bombers among radical foreigners.    Of the 90 attacks carried out in 1993 by radical foreigners,  the majority can be attributed to Kurds linked to the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. The potential for ""politically  motivated crimes committed by foreigners"" remained the same as  in 1992.    There was a significant decline in the number of criminal  acts motivated by animosity toward foreigners. In new laender  above all, the number of attacks fell by 75 percent.    The greatest praise was earned by the Thuringians, who were  the most peaceful, followed by Saarland and Bavaria.     "

Michael Fay had appealed against the  sentence of four-month jail and six strokes of the cane for two  counts of vandalism.    The chief justice said he had duly considered the  psychiatric  report and the background of the accused. He said he could not  accept that the pre-sentencing report, which could call for  probation, should have been made. This has been suggested by  the Queen's Counsel, Mr. Michael Sherrard.

During his reception of Muhammad Gulcegun, deputy chairman  of  the Turkish Social Democratic Populist Party and member of the  Turkish Grand National Assembly [title as received], and his  delegation, Ramadan added that the governments implementing the  U.S. policy are imposing a blockade on their own peoples and  subjecting them to suffering due to the deterioration in their  economic situation as a result of the continued blockade on Iraq.    The vice president touched on Iraqi-Turkish relations and  their development under hard circumstances throughout history.  He asserted that promoting the relations between the two  countries will contribute to improving the economic situation of  both neighboring peoples and consolidate regional stability and  security.

Talks on a cease-fire are still  underway while the agenda has not been discussed, he said.    In an Interfax interview he expressed doubt that a mutually  acceptable formula could be found before the talks ended.  Turajonzoda emphasized, however, that if an agreement were  signed, the opposition would observe a ceasefire inside the  Republic as well as on the border. He made it clear that the  official Dushanbe had also to abide by the agreement and  compliance with it had to be supervised by observers from the UN  and other international organizations.    Turajonzoda denied that the Tajik opposition had a hand in  terrorist activities against Russian servicemen. He emphasized  that Russia was the main guarantor of Tajikistan's security and  the country's ally.    He thought that the acts of terror against Russian  servicemen  in Tajikistan had been engineered by those who wanted to drag  Russia into the mire of civil war in Tajikistan and opposed a  political settlement there.    Lieutenant General Aleksandr Bespalov, deputy commander of  Russian border guards, told INTERFAX that the acts of terror  against his men had been committed on direct orders from the  Tajik government-in-exile. He believed that the most dangerous  acts of terror (the latest of them occurred on 24 June when  unknown gunmen fired at a bus carrying border guards officers in  Dushanbe) had been perpetrated by the Black Islam group known  for its fanaticism and callous cruelty.    Bespalov said that on the orders from the leaders of the  Tajik opposition and the commander-in-chief of its militias  Rezvon units of fighters had been concentrating on the  Tajik-Afghan border, poised for an attack on Shuroabad, Darvaza  and Bakhorak.    According to intelligence reports, the opposition leaders  ordered moving Badakhshan front units, in which Iranian,  Pakistani and Saudi mercenaries serve, from deep in Afghanistan  to border areas. A field hospital has been deployed in the  Afghan town of Chah-e Ab for Tajik opposition fighters and  mercenaries. Its staff was recruited in Islamic states.    Bespalov thought that this was evidence of Tajik opposition  leaders' intention to escalate the fighting. He said that those  who obstructed the peace process on the border and inside the  country would bear the responsibility for it.     "

He said: However, some lawless elements, posing as workers  of state security organs, have swindled and bluffed the public,  tarnishing the image and reputation of state security organs.  Recently, more than 10 criminal cases of this nature have been  investigated in a certain city alone, and a number of lawless  elements have been brought to justice.    Judging from the investigated cases, the main purpose of  these lawless elements posing as state security personnel was to  swindle money without being brought to justice. [passage omitted]    The spokesman pointed out: This kind of case of posing as  state security personnel for swindling purposes recently has  been uncovered in various localities, and all of them were made  known to the public and handled in a timely manner. These  lawless elements were not skillful swindlers; they could have  easily been identified if we stayed alert and were familiar with  relevant laws and regulations. Although state security  personnel are authorized to exercise necessary authority  pertaining to their jobs while performing their duties, they are  required to do things strictly according to law, and use their  authority correctly under any circumstances; under no  circumstances are they allowed to overstep their authority or  abuse their powers. The Ministry of State Security recently  unveiled its standardized ""investigation badge,"" which is  applicable across the country. One of the purposes of using  this investigation badge is to enable the public to distinguish  real state security personnel from phony ones, and to enable the  public to more effectively exercise supervision over state  security personnel using their authority.    The spokesman stressed: If anyone is found to have committed  illegal or criminal acts using the name of a state security  organ or personnel, the public should promptly report this to a  local state security organ. State security organs, together  with concerned departments, will punish strictly according to  law criminal elements using the name of a state security organ  to swindle.

Noting that the victory of the Cuban revolution was an  epoch-making event that terminated domination and subjugation,  backwardness and poverty on the land of Cuba and opened a way of  socialism guaranteeing sovereignty and independence, creation  and prosperity, the editorial article says:    The 35 years covered by the Cuban people after the victory  of  the revolution have been a course of constant confrontation and  struggle with the imperialist reactionaries and days in which  they decorated their history with creation and innovation. The  socialist changes and the victorious progress of the revolution  in those years clearly indicate that no force on earth can block  the road of socialism of the heroic Cuban people.    The Korean people note with high appreciation that the Cuban  people are defending the country's sovereignty and national  dignity and accelerating socialist construction, not yielding to  any adversity.    The militant comradeship and unity between the peoples of  Korea and Cuba have been further consolidated and developed in  the course of overcoming trials together and struggling hand in  hand for the common cause.    Friendship and unity between Korea and Cuba are an excellent  model of comradely relations between the peoples of  revolutionary countries.    The Korean people will, in the future, too, make every  possible effort to strengthen and fully develop their friendship  and unity with the Cuban people.    The just cause of the Cuban people will certainly end in  victory.     "

In  the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry They Don't Care  About the Legality of Juridical Acts, Which Seriously Hurts the  Common Cause""]    [Text] It is a fact that there are many problems and  shortcomings in Georgia's agriculture now, and the Ministry of  Agriculture and Food Industry has contributed its ""share"" to  this, but right now we will only discuss one defective aspect of  its activity--the legality of juridical acts issued this year  and last by the Ministry's officials.    The Procuracy's General Oversight Administration  recently examined the question, and it appears that the legality  of such acts is of no concern to the Ministry's officials. The  chronological sequence of orders is grossly violated, and  revisions, additions, erasures, and wrong numberings are made to  them regularly, on the basis of somebody's wishes or  highhandedness, and so on. Most surprising is the fact that  orders signed by Ministry officials have had changes made to  them by lower-ranking officials. No one knows why this is.    Often, orders signed by Ministry officials have comments  written by other persons. Sometimes, in addition, separate  documents are written which cancel juridical acts, although the  reason is not given, nor are they signed. The rule is that a  given act can only be cancelled by issuing a new order. Examples  of such highhanded action include the cancellation of the former  Agriculture Ministry's order of 27 August 1992 and the former  Food and Processing Industry Ministry's orders of 5 and 7  October 1992, and so on.    People in the Ministry also resort to what is known as  stopping orders. And it's done in funny ways. In particular, a  hand-written note is inserted in the orders book in place of the  juridical act that has been removed. Unfortunately, these notes  are written by technical personnel or even secretaries and  typists.    Officials of both the Ministry and its subsidiary  enterprises  and organizations often cancel previous orders with the terse  note ""cancelled"" instead of issuing a new order. It is left  vague just what the grounds were and why it all happened; just  try to guess.    Especially deplorable is the fact that the Ministry does  issue orders, but the stipulations are not fulfilled, as a  result of poor follow-through discipline. For example, a  Ministry executive order cancelled the Gori Outfitting Depot  Director's order and directed him to return to the proper  quarters 421,000 rubles' worth of fixed assets, vehicles, and  implements that had been turned over to another organization  without the Ministry's permission, and to show the value on the  balance sheet. According to the balance sheet it submitted, the  enterprise had done everything, but in fact it had not. To this  day, neither the fixed assets nor their value have been returned.    The same route has also been taken by organizations under  the  Ministry. The Sakkonservi [Russian Gruzkonserv] Association  issued an order transferring the uninstalled and unused  machinery and equipment of the now-abolished Tkviavi Canning  Plant from its own books to be distributed to other enterprises,  but it never followed up on its order. All that fine equipment  has been left out in the open; it is rusting and being stripped  and wrecked.    Juridical acts that are taken arbitrarily are hurting the  country materially. The Ministry's executives most generously,  and illegally, provided assistance to apparatus personnel. In  the course of several months, they spent 9 million rubles on  this. They often issued unlawful juridical acts giving lump-sum  assistance by way of exception. Money was given in this way to  outside persons as well. Meanwhile, the orders do not specify  the type of incentive or the reasons for it.    There have been many cases of using disciplinary punishment  not provided for in the labor law against Ministry workers and  employees. These constitute gross violations of the Code of  Labor Laws of the Georgian Republic. For example, the Ministry  issued an order by which the head of the Republic Association of  Specialized Livestock Complexes was given a stern reprimand and  a final warning--yet the law does not call for a final warning  as a disciplinary punishment. Unfortunately, there have been  many such cases.    Ministry officials (Minister Otar Kvesitadze) and certain  association executives sometimes fail to carry out court  decisions. For example, the Tbilisi Mtatsminda Rayon Court's  rulings calling for the immediate reinstatement of G.  Burdzhanadze, the director of the Kvemo Chala Prepared Food  Plant (Kaspi Rayon), to his post, were never complied with. Even  though the rulings were sustained by the City Court.    There are also instances of illegal orders in the case of  transferring workers and employees to other jobs. Unprecedented  in this regard is the use of transfer procedures to appoint  Juridical Administration Head I. Lomtatidze to the post of head  of the Disputes, Methodology, and Codification Department and,  simultaneously, the deputy head of the Juridical Administration.  This was without his consent, which is impermissible. There are  too many such cases.    Other violations and improprieties have also been found in  the Ministry. Many orders are issued to abolish enterprises and  installations without even indicating which law or normative act  serves as the basis for the liquidation, whether a liquidation  commission has been created, what specific measures must be  taken to dismiss workers and employees legally, find jobs for  them, and so on. That's what happened, for example, to the  Vivariumi Scientific-Control Center for Veterinary Drugs. The  land it occupied, and its buildings, were turned over to the  Gldani State Farm, but the relevant documents say nothing about  laying off its workers and employees or finding other jobs for  them. The same thing happened in the case of the transfer of a  training-methods office to the Institute for the Training and  Upgrading of Qualifications of Food Industry Leadership  Personnel.    The disrespect which Ministry officials have for the law can  be seen clearly by looking at cases in which depreciated cars  have been sold to certain officials. This improper practice is  rooted in the past and still persists. In July of 1992, an order  was written with an enclosure by which retired and depreciated  GAZ-24 vehicles were sold to certain officials. This constituted  an evasion of the law, in that the vehicles were sold to persons  who had been using them, whereas according to a decree of the  Georgian government the right to buy such vehicles was to be  given to personnel recommended by the labor collective and, as a  rule, a general assembly had to decide whom the car could be  sold to. Especially surprising is a recent Ministry order by  which a vehicle was given as a gift to one enterprise official  (?!).    Some juridical acts have to do with cases of damage to the  state, on the basis of which officials and materially  responsible persons have been dismissed, except the question of  recovery of the damages has been ""left out"" and no measures have  been taken.    There is no end to unlawfulness in the Ministry. This is due  to the fact that some bureaus in the Ministry often conduct  inspections and document audits in a superficial and low-quality  manner and issue orders that are equally meaningless and fail to  properly evaluate and react to serious legal violations.    One graphic example of this is an order of 2 August which  has  to do with the findings of an audit of the economic-financial  activities of the Ministry's Administration of Management and  Service Organizations. Along with numerous legal violations it  points out that four years ago the Administration (which was  then the Saksopkvebservisi [Russian Gruzselpishcheservis]  Association), sold the Vazi Hotel for 40,000 dollars. Of that  sum, 16,700 dollars went for charity work and other activities,  while the bank has blocked the remaining 22,000 dollars in its  account to this day.    For some reason, this order--and the audit document that was  written prior to it--""failed"" to observe legality of the sale of  the hotel, the proper use of the money, why the bank has blocked  the 22,000 dollars, and so on. In fact, other republic control  departments have deemed the sale of the Vazi illegal, and the  currency realized from the sale is subject to be deposited to  the budget, because the building was not depreciated and was not  to be sold; moreover, the government had not given its  permission. As for the charity, 8.8 [as printed] pounds sterling  were given, totally wrongly, to send a few students from the  Foreign Language Institute to attend a London college for a  month; the students have nothing to do with the Ministry.    Pursuant to the duties of the republic Procuracy, a number  of  rayon procurators made a selective inspection of the juridical  acts of certain enterprises and organizations and agricultural  and agroindustrial administrations subordinate to the Ministry.  On the basis of the inspections, 114 juridical acts were  protested as being illegal, 21 representations were submitted,  and three reports were sent to local boards.    These and many other cases we have material on show clearly  that in terms of ensuring the legality of juridical acts, the  Ministry's work style and methods are unacceptable, and its  practices are faulty and intolerable.    The practice of issuing illegal juridical acts is also  fostered by the fact that most orders throughout the system are  prepared without the participation of a juridical service.  Orders are written by various officials and even by ordinary  workers. They are not stamped by officials of these bureaus or  even by ordinary legal staffers. Often, in fact, they are not  even aware of the issuance of particular juridical acts.    The republic Procuracy has stated that the deplorable  situation in the Ministry is giving rise to grave consequences  and having a very destructive effect on the country's  agroindustrial complex and the safeguarding of the legitimate  interests of the state, society, and the citizen. In this  connection, a representation has been submitted to the Ministry  and the appropriate report has been sent to the Cabinet of  Ministers.     "

To be tried along with Alia are former government officials  Adil Carcani, Manush Myftiu, Rita Marko, Simon Stefani, Hekuran  Isai, Aranit Cela, Zylyftar Ramizi, Rrapi Mino, and Veiz Haderi.  The pre-trial investigations have lasted nearly a year.    The accused are charged with conspiracy leading to the  misappropriation of state property in the amount worth 2,883,502  leks. They are also charged with abuse of office and violation  of the fundamental rights of citizens resulting in economic  damages of 484,778 leks.    The results of the investigation are held to show that these  crimes were committed while the accused were serving in high  government and party posts in deliberate violation of judicial  norms and laws in force at the time.    Among the acts constituting the violation of the civil  rights  of citizens were the execution of 22 persons without trial in  1951 and the subsequent falsifying of court records.    Other former high officials of party and state shown by the  investigation to be involved in planning and carrying out these  criminal acts were: Enver Hoxha, Mehmet Shehu, Kadri Hasbiu,  Beqir Balluku, Nevzat Haznedari, Edip Cuci, Shuaip Panariti,  Vangjel Kocani, and Siri Carcani. These persons will, however,  not be tried because they are dead or missing or the statute of  limitations has expired.    The evictions and dislocations of thousands of people were  carried out in illegal fashion by special administrative organs,  when these actions were used as forms of punishment for various  civil acts.    These activities by the former organs of state security were  approved by the Politburo and carried out in secret in violation  of the Constitution and other laws in force. These practises  resulted in a pattern of continuous, systematic abuses of the  inviolability of the person (including loss of life) and  property of the citizen and the violation of his fundamental  rights including freedom of speech, assembly, press and other  forms of communication.    The accused are charged with complicity in the 1990 killing  along the state borders of persons held to be committing treason  by illegally trying to leave the country. To the charges of  murder in these cases has been added that of the desecration of  the bodies in order to create an atmosphere of intimidation  among the population.    Finally, the indictment holds the accused responsible for  the  anti-constitutional acts during 1967-1976 of forbidding the  practice of religion and the destruction of religious properties  of great historical and cultural value.

0,FT934-12144 ,"FT934-12144 _AN-DJ1C4ABNFT 931028   FT  28 OCT 93 / Political Notebook: Heroic assumptions and political realities      By PHILIP STEPHENS   THE public spending round to accompany the introduction of next month's unified Budget is nearly complete. After two months of wrangling the full cabinet will today begin taking some real decisions. There are one or two more rows to come. Under the new system the important players around the cabinet table are unwilling to settle their budgets until the last moment. The neat theory that the creation of a cabinet committee - the so-called EDX  -to thrash out the government's priorities would speed up the process has proved to be wishful thinking. Collective decision-making has its price. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will be at the head of a queue arguing that big spending cuts must fall elsewhere. He will be carrying with him, of course, the letter to Mr John Major from 14 Tory MPs threatening a backbench rebellion if the Treasury gets its way. Mr Peter Lilley, Mr David Hunt, Mrs Virginia Bottomley and Mr John MacGregor will be among others appealing to the collective good sense of their colleagues. Even the urbane Mr Douglas Hurd wants a full hearing. But if not today, then by next week the cabinet will agree a set of figures which will meet the remit set in July for public spending to be more or less frozen in real terms for the next three years. To do anything else would be to undermine fatally the notion that Mr Kenneth Clarke is serious about tackling the public sector borrowing requirement. And whatever the success of last minute appeals to the full cabinet, it is clear just where the axe will cut most deeply. The Treasury has already announced that all Whitehall budgets will be fixed on the heroic assumption that public-sector pay will not rise at all in cash terms next year. Teachers, nurses, policeman and civil servants are thus expected to take a cut in living standards. In reality ministers know that most of them will get a pay increase - at the expense of higher public-sector unemployment. But the ministers who joined Mr Clarke in the deliberations of EDX decided at the outset they had no other choice. Without a pay freeze the numbers would not add up. One participant was reminded of the hoary joke about the economist stranded on a desert island with cases and cases of food but nothing to open them with. The economist 'assumed' a can-opener. Other assumptions made when the process started back in June have disappeared already in harsh political realities. EDX, it was said, would get to grips with the inexorable rise in the Pounds 80bn social security budget - representing nearly a third of all public spending. Instead social security will emerge as one of the biggest 'winners' of the negotiations. True, Mr Lilley will be taking some harsh measures to curb the growth of invalidity benefit payments. There may also be a fierce clampdown on fraud and, probably, new restrictions on benefit payments to cover mortgage interest. But the combination of a precarious Commons majority and a series of manifesto pledges has allowed the rightwing social security security to defend most of his programmes. The Treasury cannot count the number of times Mr Lilley has responded to a demand for the means-testing of child benefit or cuts in unemployment benefit with: 'It would never get through the Commons'. So the social security budget - along with those for legal aid and agricultural support payments - will continue to rise in real terms. So too will those of health and education - though at a slower rate and at the cost of accepting a few more heroic assumptions about efficiency gains. Health is protected by a manifesto pledge, education because it was once Mr Major's big idea. Instead the main victims of EDX have been the traditional 'soft' targets for all governments: capital spending on housing and roads, the local authority grant settlement, inner city regeneration schemes and, for all Mr Rifkind's protests, defence. The participants have also discovered something else. The term unified budget is a misnomer. For all the talk of bringing together spending and revenue decisions, the Treasury has not allowed any discussion of the trade-off between the two sides of the balance sheet. It is perhaps not surprising that some ministers believe the whole concept of a unified budget will not long outlive its creator, Mr Norman Lamont.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Left-wing extremist acts of violence increased from 980  (in 1992) to 1,078, which continued the trend of the past years;  right-wing extremist acts of violence, which had risen since the  end of 1990, on the other hand, declined from 2,638 (in 1992) to  1,814, but were still considerably above the 1991 figure.    The acts of violence, which are only a part of the extremist  crimes, include homicide, bodily injury, arson and bomb attacks,  as well as offenses against the law relating to civil disorders  and rioting, and ""malicious damage with considerable use of  force."" Other crimes include offenses such as threats and  coercion. So-called propaganda crimes are particularly frequent  in the rightist scene. This is due, among other things, to the  classification of what is propaganda. Thus, the swastika a  student might spray on the wall of a house is considered to be a  right-wing extremist crime; the abbreviation RAF [Red Army  Faction], however, which is sprayed on the wall of a house, is  not classified as a left-wing extremist deed, according to the  Bonn police.    Another peculiarity must be taken into account when counting  violent crimes: For ""statistical reasons each act of violence  is counted only once, even if it consists of several individual  deeds,"" the 1992 Constitutional Protection report says. Thus,  in 1992 the street riots on the ""revolutionary 1 May"" in Berlin  were counted as a single (left-wing extremist) case of breaching  public peace. At that time 104 policemen were injured.  Similarly unimportant for the statistics was the demonstration  in Bonn against the amendment to the asylum law on 26 May last  year, which was attended by many people from the independent  scene and during which there were many cases of bodily injury  and coercion.    Statistical comparison of the crimes is also difficult  because the BfV, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations,  and the laender have been able to agree on a common definition  of what is and what is not to be counted as a crime only in the  case of right-wing extremist excesses. Thus, a preliminary BfV  statistic of December 1993 reports 8,109 such crimes (including  acts of violence) for last year. A BfV list on left-wing  extremism contains 1,336 crimes for 1993. The figures provided  by the laender are quite different in this respect. Berlin  police alone registered 3,349 left-wing extremist crimes last  year, compared with 2,060 right-wing extremist ones.    The Berlin internal affairs senator says that the so-called  autonomous activists, who ""fight"" against the renovation of the  city and Berlin's expansion to the seat of parliament and  government, are showing not only ""further increasing militancy""  but also a rising dissemination of ""discriminating writings.""  These are often lists with addresses, telephone numbers, and  car license plates of ""fascists,"" that is, of political  opponents. Recently right-wing extremists from the Rhine-Main  area imitated this procedure with the brochure DER EINBLICK,  which circulated in Main and listed addresses of ""antifascists""  all over Germany. Because of the suspected ""particular  dangerousness"" of this action, the chief federal prosecutor  assumed responsibility for the case. Since February a  25-year-old man from Frankfurt/Main has been in detention  pending trial.    Concerning left-wing extremists, the investigating public  prosecutor's offices are less successful. A functionary of the  German League, who was shot dead by unknown persons on 4 April  1992, was mentioned in the independent pamphlet INTERIM in the  form of a wanted poster two weeks before his assassination. In  February and March this year, unknown persons carried out  attacks on a Schleswig-Holstein functionary of the Liberal  Workers Party and on the owner of a discotheque in Hesse. Both  persons had been mentioned in ""hit lists"" of the scene before  the attacks.    Security experts say that increased left-wing extremist  activities are due to more intensive communication in the  ""scene""; the assumption that ""antifascism"" reacts only to the  challenges from the right is ""only half"" correct. By means of  ""electronic mailboxes"" in personal computers, better  coordination at a nationwide level is possible. More actions  are the result. The rightist scene is also up to date, and now  uses a mailbox and telephone announcements. However, the often  mentioned neo-Nazi interchange is just at its inception.    In Bonn concern is expressed that the rising violence of the  left-wing extremist scene is not sufficiently understood by the  public because of restrained media coverage. Left-wing  extremists are choosing their victims with great care, it is  said in the chancellor's office. When ""rightists"" are attacked,  the leftists expect a certain empathy and tacit tolerance by  segments of the population. Now there is the danger that this  might come true, since coverage concentrates generally on  xenophobic and neo-Nazi activities. Even though it is primarily  right-wing extremists who are responsible for deaths, today all  kinds of extremism and violence must be eradicated.    How difficult violence is to eradicate becomes clear when  looking at projects such as the Anti-Racism Information Center  (ARIC) in Duisburg, which was recently opened. The center,  which is basically financed by the Caritas organization and  Protestant church groups, urges children and youth groups as  well as ""multipliers"" [Multiplikatoren] to recognize fascisms in  its early stages. Leftist violence, on the other hand, is not on  the curriculum. The ARIC co-founder Posselt, who is responsible  for youth work in the Protestant Church in Westphalia, knows  that the enemy is on the right: In his Violence and  Racism Project manual, he claims that two Christian  Democratic Union Bundestag deputies are members of a ""right-wing  extremist network.""

In Shanghai, the largest industrial city of China, over  5,000  workers poured into the East Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace  to visit an exhibition of the heroic deeds of Bao Qifan, an  inventor and one of the ten national model workers. Meanwhile,  ""Red-May"" singing contests were held in over 30 workers' clubs.    Model workers became the stars at a rally of over 50,000  people in Chongqing in southwest China's Sichuan Province to  mark International Labor Day. With red flowers pinned to their  chests, more than 560 model workers from various circles were  praised and presented their skills at the rally.    Many workers in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei  Province, stood fast at their posts, such as sites of highway  construction, steel-making and airport construction. They made  up their minds to make greater contributions as a celebration of  their own festival on the day.    Leading officials of Liaoning Province and Shenyang city  joined the local people in get-togethers in the four major parks  in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province. They saluted  advanced workers at the provincial and city levels, who were  also invited to attend the gatherings.

[Sha'th] We have a clear position, namely, that the peace  process should end all acts of violence by both parties. All  PLO factions have committed themselves to this issue. However,  the problems, violence, and crimes committed by the Israeli  settlers-- and we have not forgotten the Hebron massacre and,  afterward, the massacre committed by the Israeli Army itself in  Gaza--all this creates an atmosphere that escalates violence on  both sides. In the 'Afula operation, not only Israeli civilians  were killed, but Palestinians on the same bus were also killed  or wounded. Consequently, we announced our denunciation and  severe regret at this operation. We, however, linked it to what  happened in Hebron and Gaza, and we insist on the fact that the  way out of this continued escalation is commitment to the dates,  signing the peace agreement, and creation of a new situation  that will prevent the settlers' violence and, consequently, ban  the violence carried out by all parties.    [Al-Shubashi] But, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, it seems that the Tel  Aviv leaders have realized the matter, or understood the  message. What about the negotiations? In the negotiations with  the Israelis, have you touched on the recent developments?    [Sha'th] No. The Israelis decided to leave the negotiations  on Wednesday, based on a notification sent in advance to us.  We, however, did our best to deter them from doing so. We told  them: How can the agreement be ready for signature on 13 April,  now that you are leaving the negotiations for three and one-half  days out of the remaining five days? This makes it impossible  to sign the agreement on 13 April. We can only view this as  procrastination. The Israeli delegation insisted on leaving the  negotiations. This decision was made prior to the 'Afula  operation.    [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Can we avoid linking this  recent Israeli behavior -- namely, not to expedite the  withdrawal or fulfilling the pledges stipulated by the  Declaration of Principles -- on the one hand and the state of  despair prevailing among the Palestinians in the occupied  Palestinian territory on the other? Furthermore, wouldn't this  situation create concern over attempts to curb the role of the  PLO?    [Sha'th] In fact, the feeling of anger that prevails in the  Palestinian arena is caused by Israeli practices carried out by  settlers. It has become clear that the crimes and massacres by  settlers have never been hidden from the Israeli Army. The  inquiry has gradually revealed collusion and disregard in terms  of controlling the settlers themselves.    We also found that the Israeli Army itself follows double  standards. The violence practiced against the Palestinian  people by the Israeli Army is not less than the crimes  perpetrated by settlers. All this, in addition to the  procrastination in reaching an agreement on the date set in the  agreement we signed in Washington, create a state of anger and  complaints in the ranks of our people.    Moving ahead toward assuming power, achieving Israeli  withdrawal, the arrival of the Palestinian force and authority,  and changing the situation on the ground will create a state of  satisfaction among our Palestinian people. This was clear in  Gaza. When Israeli withdrawal began and the groups of deportees  returned there was a clear and remarkable change among the  Palestinian masses in Gaza. This is natural. Without this, the  anger, complaints, violence, and counter-violence will continue  in our occupied territory.    [AL-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil, what is the way to get out of this  vicious circle represented by Rabin's hesitation, the situation  in the occupied territory, the frustration of the Palestinian  people, and the eroding credibility of the PLO and the  Palestinian leadership represented by President 'Arafat? How  will the PLO overcome the situation so it will not reach an  impasse?    [Sha'th] The peace, which we began in Madrid, and, then, the  signing of the accord in Washington, must be implemented on the  ground to gain support from the Palestinian and Israeli masses.  We have been trying to end the talks at the set time. It is no  secret to say that we have worked day and night over the past  two weeks, particularly following the signing of the Hebron  agreement, to accomplish the mission on the set date. We have  prepared detailed plans for the entry of the Palestinian police  and for Israeli withdrawal, and groups of deportees have  returned home.    There is no doubt that we want the lists of deportees and  prisoners to include all the sons of our people with all their  factions. However, those who returned this time were not only  from the historical political leaders, but also from the heroic  leaders of the intifadah who have returned to lead the daily  activities in the Palestinian street to receive the Palestinian  police and authority and to change the situation on the ground.    Therefore, we tried to break this deadlock through intensive  work on the level of the talks and on the level of the  Palestinian police so that we enter on the fixed date. I do not  see any other way to break the deadlock except this one. We  need Arab and international support to achieve this. In other  words, the solution lies in accomplishing the preparatory steps  and entering the homeland as soon as possible.    [Al-Shubashi] What is your assessment of Peres' saying that  Israeli withdrawal would be accomplished at the end of April?    [Sha'th] The problem is that we can longer see any respect  for any set date. If the matter is clear and the agreement this  time is firm we will have another opinion. We have enough  flexibility to accept dates that are very close to 13 [April] if  such dates are decided for purely practical reasons. However,  we no longer trust these dates. We want these dates to be  respected in order to accept any new steps for the future. The  coming date now is 13 April, so we, as well as Minister Peres,  should support any necessary effort to reach this date. During  the telephone call which Minister Peres held with [Egyptian]  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, I spoke personally with him at his  request and at the request of brother Minister 'Amr Musa. Peres  tried to respond to our call for intensifying the talks and  agreed on sending the Israeli delegation today, Friday, [8  April], for at least one day so as not to waste time. The  delegation will come again on Sunday. A few hours after this  agreement, the office of Prime Minister Rabin denied this matter  and claimed that he knows nothing about it and that the Israeli  delegation cannot go to Egypt on Friday.    I believe that many things should be accomplished before  restoring the credibility of Israeli dates on which they agreed  with us.    [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Dr. Nabil Sha'th.    [Sha'th] Thank you.     "

Yet while Dollars 8bn-worth of red ink and another 60,000 job losses will slim IBM's distended cost base, it is by no means clear that current plans will solve the underlying difficulty. IBM has a near monopoly control of mainframe computer technology but it is rapidly being undercut by lower cost alternatives. Perhaps the most disturbing element of yesterday's figures was the 12.9 per cent fall in hardware sales during the second quarter. The company is losing market share in mainframe computers to networked personal and mini-computers and other large system manufacturers. The downturn in mainframe sales is not as bad as the first quarter, but the pricing structure of the entire market is being progressively undermined. Those price and market share pressures will only intensify as the industry consolidates on standard equipment. IBM, however, cannot easily extricate itself or its customers from its existing technology. Almost all of its business units are involved in mainframes, and the company's unified salesforce is focused on selling packages of this 'big iron'. Mr Lou Gerstner, the new chairman, has the near-impossible task of managing the exit from the old mainframe technology while the company is still heavily dependent on the revenues it provides. Breaking the company up into more responsive business units may well be sensible in theory, and might have been more easily done in happier times. What bits of Big Blue would now be worth is impossible to say, and the route from here to there is as murky as ever.   Companies:-  International Business Machines Corp.

He said he had met both ANC leader Nelson Mandela and Mr  Buthelezi in previous years. Mr Mandela was ""one of the great  figures of the epoch...and I remember how passionately Mr  Buthelezi criticised the government and the institutions of that  time"".    With a nod also at Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha who  attended the conference on behalf of the government, Mr  Kissinger praised the ""truly heroic effort by the chief actors  to overcome their memories, their suffering and doubts"".

The charges have been filed under Article 142 of the Penal Code  of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.    According to the Sabac prosecutor's office, in addition  Vuckovic is charged with the criminal acts of rape and looting  under Articles 103 and 168 of the Penal Code of Serbia.    TANJUG learned today from the prosecutor's Office in Sabac  that the indictment states that, as a member of a volunteer unit  under the command of the Zvornik (in the Srpska republic)  defense staff, Vuckovic, while under the influence of alcohol,  killed 16 and wounded 12 civilians of Muslim nationality with a  machine gun in the village of Celopek. During the investigation  he admitted killing seven people.    The victims, all members of Muslim nationality, were under  guard in the village of Celopek near Zvornik following an action  to disarm them. Vuckovic, who committed the criminal acts of  rape and looting on the territory of Serbia, is in detention  awaiting trial.     "

The revolution is our  guarantor and the struggle is the means with which to protect  our people and regain our rights.    The mosque massacre and all the enemy's massacres,  practises,  and policies explicitly prove it is impossible to coexist with  this enemy, and that our people's only option is that of the  revolution and struggle to defend our existence and rights.  These crimes exposed for the umpteenth time the wretchedness  and futility of the settlement course, and the suspect peace  calls. More than this, these crimes offer new evidence as to  the catastrophic dangers posed by this course and these venomous  calls not only to the security of the nation and the people but  to the personal safety of the defenseless citizen who is  prostrated in prayer in God's places of worship.    Masses of our Arab and Islamic nation, in wake of all this,  will the supporters of the negotiations and of what is falsely  termed peace repent, or do they relish telling lies, forging the  people's will, conceding rights, reneging the martyrs, tampering  with the nation's destiny under claims of rationalism and waging  a struggle on the negotiations table, and competing to submit to  the enemy under the excuse that there is no other alternative?  Faced with the enemy's massacres and its plan to destroy us,  can there be any other option than self-defense? Has treason  and the course of capitulation protected anyone, even those who  are performing prayers in God's places of worship?    We call on the nation's masses and the Palestinian people to  cling to the intifadah and armed struggle option, and to  escalate, protect, and support the intifadah in a manner that  would topple the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its symbols, led by  traitor 'Arafat.    Glory and immortality to the righteous martyrs of the  Ibrahimi Mosque, and of our intifadah and revolution. Greetings  to our people's heroic intifadah. Shame on the traitors and  agents. We pledge to pursue the struggle until the attainment  of all the our people's objectives of liberation and  repatriation. Victory for the revolution and immortality for  our martyrs.    The odious bloody massacre by rancorous Zionist gangs devoid  of human feeling, and thirsty for killing and destroying all  that is Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim is a crime against our  defenseless people and the groups of worshipers in the Ibrahimi  Mosque at dawn on 25 February 1994. It testfies once again to  the racist and sanguinary nature of this entity, and clearly  exposes its persistence to carry out the policy of killing,  persecuting, and destroying all that is Arab, Palestinian, and  Muslim. At the same time, this reprehensible crime highlights  the meaning, nature, and upshot of the Zionist-U.S. peace and  the role of the Oslo conspiracy and the treasonous Gaza-Jericho  agreement and its subsequent chapters.    Masses of our Arab and Islamic nation, Yes, this is the  accurate interpretation of the Zionist-U.S. peace. It consists  of daily massacres, of persecution and starvation, and of  destruction and eviction. While criminal Zionist Rabin and his  traitor partner 'Arafat sign with one hand the documents and  chapters of the conspiracy in Oslo, Washington, and Cairo, they  hurl with the other hand bombs and open fire on the defenseless  sons of our people in mosques, streets, and houses, emphasizing  that the peace that is sought is one of surrendering to the  Zionist butcher's knife, and defining the form of the peace they  want with the blood of our people and sons.    While the Zionists pursue their massacres against the  innocent and the defenseless, the traitors persist with their  betrayal of the people, the cause, and the martyrs, and continue  to submit to the enemy, thus confirming to it that its methods  are successful and encouraging it to pursue the policy of  destroying our people. They did not learn lessons from their  agreement with Philip Habib, when they opted for their safety  and left our people in Beirut as prey for the Zionist and  islolationist gangs, under Sharon. Our people at the time were  massacred in Sabra and Shatila. They also did not learn lessons  from Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, and al-Dawayimah, and from all the  massacres the Zionist gangs committed to expel our people and  force them to become refugees. They never learned the lesson  and led our people from one massacre to the other under the  mirage of settlements, lies, treason, and the falsification of  facts as they had forged the people's will. Now, they  impudently claim that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron  seeks to foil the so-called Gaza-Jericho agreement, although  Rabin and Peres have been announcing that they were negotiating  with themselves and that they got all that they wanted. This  means that the traitors threaten our people with more massacres  if they do not condone their treason.     "

In the same way as they directed their  internationally-prohibited missiles of mass destruction toward  Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Ma'rib, and al-Rahidah, killing  innocent children, women, elderly people, and men, and  destroying the secure residential areas, they did not spare the  valiant city of Aden from their treacherous, cowardly strikes.  Missile strikes were dealt to it by the forces of apostasy and  secession during the past few days, aiming at the residential  areas in the city of Aden as if the bloodthirsty criminals --  through this terrorist action -- are warning the citizens in the  valiant city of Aden with the aim of terrorizing them and  dissuading them from joining the ranks of unity and  constitutional legitimacy. The hand of treachery, rancor,  treason, and secession is being extended to steadfast and heroic  Abyan everyday.

Our sources view this as an attempt to block  all access roads into the governorate and prevent infiltration  by opposition groups.    In the past few months, the city of Mosul and the  surrounding  countryside were the scenes of many revolutionary operations and  armed assaults against ruling party offices, security centers,  and intelligence departments. The operations escalated such  that they became almost daily occurrences.    Our sources say that the checkpoints deployed by the  criminal  Qusayy search all citizens and vehicles entering the governorate  and the city of Mosul in particular.    Elsewhere, the criminal Khalid [no surname as heard], an  officer in Saddam's security apparatus, was killed and two of  his escorts were wounded when they were attacked by an Islamic  Resistance hero on the road to Suq al-Shuyukh District in  al-Nasiriyah [Dhi Qar] Governorate in the middle of January.    Our sources in southern Iraq said a security detail that the  officer was commanding tried to arrest the struggler, who  belonged to the Al-Ghumays clan. The struggler pulled an 8.5-mm  pistol and shot and killed the security officer. He then opened  fire on the remaining members of the detail, killing [as heard]  two and wounding another before being martyred himself when he  ran out of ammunition.

This was proposed at the provincial meeting on  launching a special struggle against the law-breaking and  criminal offenses of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts  held in Xingcheng on 18-20 May.    Directors of tax bureaus of 14 cities across the province  attended the meeting. The participants summed up and exchanged  experiences in dealing blows to fake receipts during the  previous stage and defined tasks for launching this special  struggle in the near future. Five models, including Shenyang,  Anshan, Dandong, Fuxin, and Chaoyang, introduced their  experiences.    The meeting pointed out: If we fail to properly manage  special-purpose receipts, direct and big losses of taxation of  the state will inevitably be created and reform of the tax  system will be a failure. Therefore, tax departments at all  levels should regard the management of special-purpose receipts  as an important means for guaranteeing the smooth implementation  of the tax system reform and enhance the sense of responsibility  and urgency. Certainly, strengthening management over  special-purpose receipts does not mean to slacken efforts in the  management of receipts that are not related to the value-added  tax. Contrarily, we should step up our efforts to strengthen  management and inspection in an effort to stop up the loophole  in the management of tax revenue and financial affairs and  guarantee that the state taxation and property will not be  infringed.    The meeting held that at present the most serious and  harmful  thing reflected in the problem on receipts is the forging,  reselling and stealing of special-purpose receipts related to  value-added tax. Using receipts to engage in law-breaking and  criminal activities such as tax evasion has become a social  nuisance in society. It affects many sectors, and most of these  law-breaking and criminal activities are carried out covertly.  It is not easy to discover and solve this problem by relying  only on the inspection of tax departments. It is necessary to  maintain close coordination with the public security, judicial,  and procuratorial departments and take joint actions. Tax  departments at all levels, when they discover the law-breaking  acts of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts during their  inspection and when these acts constitute a crime, should  promptly transfer the persons involved to the judicial organs  for punishment.    The meeting stressed: Like we treat the banknotes, we should  consider strengthening management over receipts as a major  affair and grasp it firmly and well. We should investigate and  handle each and every law-breaking and criminal activity of  forging, reselling, and stealing receipts we discover,  resolutely check the law-breaking acts of using receipts to  bring a series of harm to society, and create a good environment  for the smooth implementation of the new tax system.

He now is a communications  consultant based in Los Angeles.      Like 1988's ""Mississippi Burning,"" this year's ""The Long Walk Home"" is another  case of Hollywood's telling it like it wasn't about the struggle by blacks to  throw off the cruel shackles of the Southern segregation system.    ""Mississippi Burning"" was a grievously distorted version of the 1964  assassination of three civil-rights workers in Philadelphia, Miss. ""The Long  Walk Home"" is a grossly misleading and sentimentalized sugar-coated version of  the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.    That Hollywood, in its latest mini-fad, is at last paying some attention to the  civil rights struggle is a good thing. The problem -- or my problem, anyway --  with these movies is that they are being presented as somewhat fictionalized  but historically accurate versions of actual events.    ""The Long Walk Home"" purports to tell us what happens in rigidly segregated  Montgomery (""the cradle of the Confederacy"") when one white upper-class Country  Club housewife/mother-of-two, Mrs. Norman Thompson (Sissy Spacek), undergoes a  180-degree moral turnaround that begins when her longtime maid, Odessa (Whoopi  Goldberg) is called ""nigger"" and is run out of a white park where she's been  deposited to baby-sit the Thompson children.    Mrs. Thompson uses her political clout and social position to force the abusive  cop to apologize to her and the maid, which he does, even addressing the maid  as ""Mrs. Cotter."" That a white Southern cop, or any white person, for that  matter, would apologize to any black person for anything -- even a killing or  lynching -- was extremely unlikely in that era.

The North Carolina newspaper where I cut my teeth as a reporter in the '50s  would have gotten around the ""Mrs."" problem -- as would have other papers -- in  this case by calling the maid ""Odessa Cotter"" in the first paragraph and ""the  Cotter woman"" thereafter.    When in this movie the bus boycott begins (we hear Martin Luther King Jr.'s  eloquent call to arms from inside the SRO church while Odessa and her family  stand in a crowd outside), Mrs. Thompson's husband walks out, and she is  suddenly isolated with her two little girls.    But instead of caving in, she pluckily turns her back on security, tradition,  upbringing and social acceptance and actually joins the boycott by using the  family station wagon to car-pool black workers around Montgomery -- even  putting them in the front seat with her. At movie's end, we see a threatened  Mrs. Thompson and Odessa holding hands and silencing and facing down a raving  mob of whites with only the quiet strength and dignity of their moral  superiority.    Could anything like this have actually happened in the South during the '50s or  '60s? Utterly and completely impossible.    In all of my years of coming of age as a reporter in my native South in the  '50s, and covering all of the major civil-rights stories for Newsweek in the  '60s, I knew of only a very, very rare upper-class Southern white woman who  spoke out even tentatively against the brutalities and inequities visited on  black people. Marching? Protesting? Holding hands, or even meeting with blacks?  Boycotting? Not a chance.    It wasn't that all Southern white women -- or all white men -- were deep-dyed  racists. But the intimidation -- the spoken and unspoken threat of  cross-burnings, beatings, burnings, social ostracization, loss of money and  position -- was too great and too all-pervasive. As Martin Luther King Jr.  often pointed out, whites were as much victims of the system of segregation as  blacks -- though certainly not so brutally used by it.    So to present in a movie that a well-meaning white woman and her rather passive  maid could actually defeat a white mob and score a major triumph against  segregation is about as far from reality as one could get.    Well, so what to these Hollywood variations from what actually happens? What's  the big deal, as long as the evils of segregation are illuminated in a  compelling drama (which, by the way, this is not)?

And  what is the main message conveyed to these virgin minds by both ""Mississippi  Burning"" and ""The Long Walk Home""?    The main message, in both pictures, is that white people are the heroes, that  blacks were only background players. ""Mississippi Burning"" was about two heroic  FBI agents, when in fact the FBI's role was anything but heroic, a mere  delivering of a $30,000 bribe to an informer. In ""The Long Walk Home,"" a white  woman is the central heroic figure, when in fact it was only the bravery and  the bloodshed of black people in Montgomery that broke bus segregation and  launched a bloody 10-year struggle that eventually overcame, at the cost of  dozens of black lives, the meaner aspects of segregation in the South.

He now is a communications  consultant based in Los Angeles.      Like 1988's ""Mississippi Burning,"" this year's ""The Long Walk Home"" is another  case of Hollywood's telling it like it wasn't about the struggle by blacks to  throw off the cruel shackles of the Southern segregation system.    ""Mississippi Burning"" was a grievously distorted version of the 1964  assassination of three civil-rights workers in Philadelphia, Miss. ""The Long  Walk Home"" is a grossly misleading and sentimentalized sugar-coated version of  the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott.    That Hollywood, in its latest mini-fad, is at last paying some attention to the  civil rights struggle is a good thing. The problem -- or my problem, anyway --  with these movies is that they are being presented as somewhat fictionalized  but historically accurate versions of actual events.    ""The Long Walk Home"" purports to tell us what happens in rigidly segregated  Montgomery (""the cradle of the Confederacy"") when one white upper-class Country  Club housewife/mother-of-two, Mrs. Norman Thompson (Sissy Spacek), undergoes a  180-degree moral turnaround that begins when her longtime maid, Odessa (Whoopi  Goldberg) is called ""nigger"" and is run out of a white park where she's been  deposited to baby-sit the Thompson children.    Mrs. Thompson uses her political clout and social position to force the abusive  cop to apologize to her and the maid, which he does, even addressing the maid  as ""Mrs. Cotter."" That a white Southern cop, or any white person, for that  matter, would apologize to any black person for anything -- even a killing or  lynching -- was extremely unlikely in that era. And to address a black woman as  ""Mrs.""? As Gov. George Wallace would have put it, that would have been as  likely as finding socks on a rooster.    The North Carolina newspaper where I cut my teeth as a reporter in the '50s  would have gotten around the ""Mrs."" problem -- as would have other papers -- in  this case by calling the maid ""Odessa Cotter"" in the first paragraph and ""the  Cotter woman"" thereafter.

Meeting in Moscow Tuesday with the pilots who voluntarily  manned the helicopter carrying the kidnappers, Grachev said that  the terrorists were greeted by a car and a helicopter.    Grachev has said that after the terrorists chose a  helicopter  as a means of transport, it became clear that they were going  neither to Iran nor to Turkey. He said that the pilots managed  to fool the terrorists and land the helicopter at another place  which helped their prompt detention.    Journalists were informed of the terrorists' plans. They  planned to make a false landing in the Chechen Republic, then,  by using radio silence, to fly over to Khasavyurt (Dagestan)  where they were being awaited by their accomplices and a  transportation means for escape. However, the pilots spotted  the helicopter on the ground and altered the course of their  chopper. Bad weather conditions helped the pilots to deceive  the hijackers and they landed in the suburb of Makhachkala.    Congratulating the pilots, Grachev said that the  helicopter's  chief pilot, Valentin Padalka, and he fought in Afghanistan for  almost one year. The minister also said President Yeltsin  instructed him to give the pilots high state awards.    The minister said by their heroic deed Russian pilots raised  even higher the country's prestige in the international arena.  During the operation, he said, the army showed cohesion and  that it was able to accomplish difficult tasks. That is why all  attempts to disintegrate the army will only weaken it, he said.    The minister said that it is planned to complete the  withdrawal of Russian troops from abroad.     "

The Land Office for the Protection of  the Constitution said that the potential for extreme-right  violence is ""alarmingly high"" in Saxony-Anhalt. Last year, there  were 328 violent acts with an extreme-right connection, Interior  Minister Walter Remmers (Christian Democratic Union) said when  he presented the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of  the Constitution in Magdeburg. The centers of extreme-right  activity are above all the big cities of Halle and Magdeburg.    According to the Office for the Protection of the  Constitution, the violent confrontations between right-wing and  left-wing extremists have assumed a new dimension. The  threshold for brutal violence has been lowered on both sides.  With 70 violent acts against leftists motivated by right-wing  extremism in 1993, the number of these offenses has doubled.  [passage omitted]    Right-wing extremism did not come to the old FRG from the  former GDR only after unification. With this opinion, Saxony  Interior Minister Heinz Eggert (CDU) contradicted statements to  this effect made by Federal Prosecutor General Nehm. It is true  that the propensity for violence has increased significantly in  the east, ""but this is connected with the police's inability to  act at this stage,"" Eggert told DIE WELT. Criminal offenses by  the extreme-left (57) in the Free State of Saxony remained  constant compared with 1992.     "

Mass rallies were held on May 22 and 23 in North Pyongan,  South Hwanghae and Kangwon Provinces and Kaesong municipality.    Senior officials and representatives of workers,  agricultural  working people, youth and students and men of culture in the  Provinces and municipality spoke at the rallies.    The speakers said the Kwangju popular uprising in May 1980  was a massive armed uprising in which the entire Kwangju  citizens turned out and made a decisive resistance to the  fascist violence in order to terminate the colonial domination  of the U.S. imperialists and the military fascist rule and to  achieve democratisation of the South Korean society and the  reunification of the country, and a just anti-U.S., anti-fascist  democratic resistance.    The desire of the valiant Kwangju resistance fighters for  independence and democratisation of the South Korean society  still has not been realized owing to the colonial enslavement  policy of the U.S. imperialists, they noted.    They stressed that in order to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam  puppet regime and realize the desire of the martyrs of Kwangju,  the South Korean students and people should wage vigorous mass  struggles in all places to scrap such fascist laws as the  ""National Security Law"", dissolve all the repressive machines  and establish a true democratic government.    They stressed the need for the people of all segments of  South Korea to turn out to check and frustrate the colonial  domination and interference of the United States and get the  U.S. Forces and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South Korea.

Spreadsheets are the most common way that people become programmers. If asked, the person concerned would call themselves an accountant or a clerk. Nevertheless, what they do is programming. Sometimes people grapple with - and master - tools that would make the software professional shudder. Mr Julian Soltau of Mercantile and General is a perfect example. He writes programs (which he calls reports) in one of the most primitive languages around. The report language of the system was extremely dated but he had conquered it and made it work for the business. I felt this was a heroic achievement. Mercantile  General have blended the mainframe and the PCs well to suit their requirements. They still have some way to go towards full integration  -they are still manually copying some figures from one to the other. However, the flexibility of the current system has enabled them to keep the personnel head-count remarkably low for the work-load. I suspect that Mr Soltau will be amazed at how far modern query languages have come. The new report writer promised for the system should make his life easier. He will then face the next joy of programming - converting all his existing work over to the new system. Key points from this study: Ordinary people can master complex systems. Even an imperfect system can produce good results if it is flexible. It is more important to have tools than fixed solutions.  The Financial Times   London Page X  "

The agency's correspondent, who is currently stationed in  the  axis of Abyan-al-'Alam-Aden, added that he noticed that our  Armed Forces operating in the battlefields in this axis are  eager not to harm our people in these areas, which are being  purged of separatist forces. The correspondent went on to say:  Our forces are making a deliberate effort to avoid damage to  vital and service facilities that serve people in these areas.  He pointed to the damage caused to economic installations, as  well as the destruction of all vital facilities carried out by  the secessionist gang so that citizens may not benefit from  them. For example, in the first days of the secessionist gang's  unleashing of the crisis, it cut off the power supply feeding  Abyan from Aden in retaliation against its heroic sons for the  nationalist unity-orientated positions they have taken, for  their confrontation of this gang's secessionist plan, and also  for the support they have lent to the forces of unity and  legitimacy, which are valiantly confronting the destructive  secessionist plan announced by the war criminal, agent, and  traitor 'Ali al-Bid. Furthermore, several other economic  facilities and service installations became targets of  aggressive bombardment by the secessionist and separatist forces  when they were compelled to retreat and withdraw from their  positions. This reflects the malicious spirit and destructive  instincts of this criminal secessionist gang.     "

It calls you, your unity  and cohesion, your national identity, your national affiliation,  your awareness and understanding and it urges you to rise up as  one man to achieve the great goal of expelling the hateful  Zionist occupation and its dark age from our country so our  people can enjoy freedom and independence.    Let us all chant our historic slogan: ""All rifles should be  directed against the enemy, and all efforts and energies should  be mobilized to fight the enemy, which is seeking to destroy our  life and future.""    Let each one act from his position to confront the army's  occupation and the hordes of its settlers. Let a new wave of  our brave intifadah move in one national voice and one combat  spirit. This time is no longer one for differing slogans and  speeches. Rather, it is one for a unified national action, which  allows only for different actions.    Yes, this is a time for a unified national action and this  is  a time for a national unity to protect the lives of our people  and bring double retaliation to the murderers, the hordes of the  Zionist settlers, and the occupation army and authorities that  protect these murderers. Let us work in the arenas of struggle,  conflict, and confrontation as one unified rank and let us all  chant in one voice: Either freedom and independence or fighting.  Long live Palestine free, Arab, and Palestinian.     "

He said: This savage act was in fact a declaration of war  against Islam, and those who have no respect whatsoever for the  status of the family of the prophet undoubtedly adhere to no  doctrine or school of thought.    The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran added: The  perpetrators of such acts should know that such crimes will lead  to nothing but the further consolidation of the revolution's  foundations. Moreover, such acts draw the attention of Muslims  and the followers of other divine religions to the scared  notions of Islam.    Ayatollah Emami-Kashani described the terrorist actions of  the Monafeqin throughout the history of the Islamic revolution.  He then commemorated the martyrs of 7 Tir [bomb blast in  Islamic Republic Party on 28 June 1981], of Mashhad'a 'Ashura  [bomb blast on 20 June 1994], and the other martyrs of the  revolution. He said: The recent act by the Monafeqin was  condemned in many countries. However, mere condemnation of these  savage acts, by Islamic communities and Shiite and Sunni  scholars is not enough, and the Islamic world has a duty to  react against such crimes.     "

According to the prosecutorial complaint, read out by Judge  Mrs Csiky Julianna Szobacsi, the party's aims and deeds sharply  violate constitutional provisions related to human rights and  fundamental freedoms, particularly the right to human dignity,  minority rights, the equality of citizens, and the freedom of  learning.    The party proposes university applicants should state their  nationality, with Gypsies and Jews to be admitted according to  their numerical proportion, in addition to ability.    In its monthly, MAGYAR TUDAT (HUNGARIAN CONSCIOUSNESS),  published on November 16, 1993, the VNP (registered on October  11, 1993) published an article entitled ""Justice to Ferenc  Szalasi"", making the fascist takover in Hungary appear as a  heroic deed.    Ferenc Szalasi (1897-1946), leader of the Hungarian fascist  (Arrow-Cross) party, seized power on October 15, 1944 with  Hitler's help and introduced a reign of terror to the country.  He was condemned to death by the Hungarian people's court and  executed as a war-criminal.    At a meeting in Budapest's 13rd district on January 18,  1994,  VNP activists incited hatred against Jews and Gypsies living in  Hungary. The police investigated the case as representing a  crime of incitement against a community and recently sent  related documents and an accusation proposal to the court.    Party Chairman Albert Szabo and his defender asked the court  to dismiss the prosecution's complaint as unfounded and denied  the charge of unconstitutional party operations.    Szabo pointed out that newspaper reports on the VNP's  January  18 meeting distorted the facts because they are not racists but  would like to replace predatory capitalism by socialism based on  national ideas. The trial will continue on April 13.     "

[Fadlallah] Should I apologize for having such a title?  This title has never had any significance on the organizational  level. It was given to me by Western intelligence services when  they found nobody else in the arena. For 40 years now, I have  been an Islamic activist on a broad level; I have never tied  myself down to any specific party. In Iraq, I opened up to the  al-Da'wah Party, while I was not one of them. I also have had  ties with Hizballah and other parties in the Islamic world. I  am an active Shiite not in the ideological sense, but in the  Islamic sense. At the same time, my mind was open to all other  secular streams. Since the fifties, I have struck up  friendships with communists, nationalists, and Ba'thists. I  always talk to them because I do not believe in having a closed  mind toward anybody else, since everybody who believes in,  respects, and takes pride in his thinking should respect the  thinking of others.    [Jallul] It seems that the Islamic stream should today  confront the progress made on the level of establishing the  state institutions. This means the Islamic stream either  confronts or accommodates this development. What will this  stream choose?    [Fadlallah] I do not think that any Islamic current can have  reservations about the establishment of the state, in its broad  sense, since it is either a state or anarchy. We as Muslims  think that, as the leaders of the faithful say, the people  should have a ruler, because a vacuum does not serve anybody and  because anarchy can contribute more to the disintegration of  society than a bad government. Therefore, no one can put  forward the option of having or not having a state. The only  option is that there should be a state; people can then work  within this state to oppose its plans and to propose ideas that  could change its attitudes in the future. The opposition acts  within the state, and not outside it. We in Lebanon oppose  security, social, and political disorder.    [Jallul] Does this mean you are for a peaceful transfer of  power and agree to the Constitution and all other pillars of the  state?    [Fadlallah] There is a difference. To feel that there must  be a state does not mean you believe in all its components. We  coexist with falsehood, but do not recognize its legitimacy. It  is similar to anyone who promotes a certain thinking: this  person believes his thinking is the legitimate authority, in the  principled sense of legitimacy; however, this person does not  defy the legitimate authority he finds in his country that  preserves public order. He might, of course, ask people by  peaceful means to join his legitimate authority.    [Jallul] Do you condone modern activities and appearances in  your region?    [Fadlallah] When you come to the suburb, Ba'labakk, or some  areas in the south, you will see an unveiled woman walking next  to a veiled woman. You will also hear one radio carrying all  sorts of songs, as well as another radio carrying Islamic songs.  People exercise their freedoms in a very normal way. Since the  Islamic movement was launched, it has never been reported that a  woman was beaten because she was not wearing a veil. Also,  schoolgirls have never been forced to wear a veil.    [Jallul] Can the Communist Party hold a political symposium  near your residence?    [Fadlallah] It used to do that. Perhaps, when there was an  act of sedition, some people had fears in view of the general  atmosphere so they refrained from any activities. There is no  such thing as an Islamic republic in the suburbs or Ba'labakk or  about Islam being enforced, one way or another.    [Jallul] But you know that a criminal was executed at your  party's headquarters, the Islamic way?    [Fadlallah] The issue was related to a tribal movement, and  the area was heading toward sedition, in which blood could have  been shed indiscriminately. The Islamists did not move to  arrest or execute the killer, but the people called for the  implementation of the Islamic law. So, the killer was executed  with the consent of all the tribes concerned with this issue.  There was an official silence by various officials who approved  this without declaring it. The state could not prevent the  shedding of blood due to the circumstances of the tribal  community. Moreover, you know that the state has never been  able to stop tribal acts of revenge except through  reconciliation and accord.    [Jallul] The state says that the media must be organized. Do  you agree with this?    [Fadlallah] The fact is that anyone who has money in Lebanon  can establish a television station. It is a paradox that those  who own the illegal television stations, as they say, occupy  prominent positions in the state. So parties who used to own  television stations have sold them to those who have money.  Making money the basis for the establishment of television or  radio stations regardless of the policy of this or that news  media could be a serious issue. However, the issue which  imposes itself in every democratic state, or any state which  believes in freedoms, if we do not want to use the word  democracy, is that who determines the seriousness of or the need  for another news media? Is it the state?    [Jallul] Yes, if we accept the state's authority.    [Fadlallah] Perhaps, the state is responsible for people's  security concerning what they hear or read. This could be true  when the state and its men are trustworthy people. The state  that used to own television and radio stations did not prevent  its men from establishing illegal television and radio stations  at their own expense, why? I wonder if the militias, as they  say, violate the law, why don't the state men violate the law?  Why do they have their own news media if the state's news media  meet the country's need? This means that the state did not  present a successful media program to the people that meets  their needs and fulfills their aspirations, and which represents  the democratic slogan of the state.    [Jallul] Are not we supposed to give the state some time,  especially since less than two years have passed on its plan to  enforce the law?    [Fadlallah] We note that some people have contributed to  confusing the state by adding news media to the state run media  and encouraged others to do so. This means that they have not  strengthened the state's plan, but their own positions. The  problem is that any president, whether he is number one, two, or  three works to plant his men in the state institutions in order  to be a reserve for him in the future to maintain his influence  after he leaves his post.    [Jallul] Have not things always been this way?    [Fadlallah] They were not as aggressive as they are now. The  problem in the past was that the statesmen used to take bribes,  and the problem these days is that the statesmen bribe other  people. This is why some people have contributed to corrupting  the state. The deputy, the minister, the director general, this  man of religion, that economic position are all taking bribes.  We heard that no sect or party is allowed to have its own news  media. So, since you recognize sectarianism and parties and you  act in your position as a representative of this or that sect,  then what is the difference between your sectarianism to which  you resort and from which you derive strength, and that  sectarianism which exists in a newspaper or a television  station? If the government includes licensed parties why  shouldn't these parties be allowed to have their own news media?    [Jallul] There is a great deal of fear that the ""Islamic  resistance"" seeks to gain domestic weight?    [Fadlallah] I can say that the Islamic resistance is a  movement that confronts Zionism, particularly in Lebanon. This  resistance is not an exhibitionist or an adventurous movement.  I can also assert to everyone that the Islamic resistance does  not have any internal plan in Lebanon unless it, as a community,  is subjected to mad repression, in which case it is natural for  the Islamic resistance to defend itself.    [Jallul] Why did other currents leave the resistance?    [Fadlallah] The problem is that these currents have isolated  themselves from the scene. I talked to some of them who  informed me about their economic problems. In the past, they  used to have financial support, and I believe this support has  stopped.    [Jallul] Do you agree on the decision which dissolved the  ""Lebanese Forces?""    [Fadlallah] I do not have any data in this regard. We  differ with ""the forces"" whether over their relations with  Israel or their political proposals.    [Jallul] Do you believe that the Syrian-Iranian differences  over the Middle East issue could have repercussions on the  Islamic current in Lebanon?    [Fadlallah] I believe that Syrian-Iranian relations are  based on an understanding of the circumstances surrounding  Syria. The Islamic Republic [of Iran] appreciates these  circumstances although it rejects the idea. Moreover, there is  a strategic political situation surrounding the Iranian-Syrian  relations, so you feel that both countries need one another.  Thus, I do not imagine that the future relations with Iran  would deteriorate even if Syria actually achieves reconciliation  [with Israel]. This is so because there are other very deep  issues which transcend the differences in political views,  especially since Iran, which is opposed to reconciliation [with  Israel], did not wage a fierce war on this issue.    [Jallul] You have frequently announced your support for the  Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria. Do you not fear being  accused of interfering in Algeria's internal affairs?    [Fadlallah] All influential parties are interfering in  Algeria. I know that the French are interfering strongly, and  France has a broad current inside the Algerian Government. I  also know that the United States is interfering effectively, and  sometimes it may suggest that it is supportive of the Salvation  Front. There are Arab states which support this or that team.  Perhaps, Iran is the state that is extending the least support  in Algeria. Others, however, have an arrogant media policy  which tries to influence all their moves and schemes. The  problem in Algeria is that it has turned into a scene for many  international intelligence services. We are very sad about the  situation in this country which was a symbol of awareness and  freedom; we grew up on the heroic deeds of the Algerian  mujahidin. We feel that the Algerian state is a victim of the  U.S.-French conflict. As long as the United States is chasing  France everywhere, and as long as France is trying to maintain  its positions here and there, each country in the Arab World and  in the Third World in which there is French influence will  suffer in one way or another from what Algeria is suffering.

But in the category of vandalism against Jewish property, the numbers declined  somewhat in California, largely because of vigorous prosecution of members of  neo-Nazi ""skinhead"" gangs and other offenders, the report said.    The conclusions were announced in Los Angeles on Thursday by the league, which  audited two categories of incidents -- vandalism against property and  harassment of individuals -- in 40 states.    David A. Lehrer, the league's regional director in Los Angeles, told a news  conference that national incidents of vandalism -- including arson, bombings  and swastika daubings -- increased by 18.5% last year, from 694 to 823  incidents. Harassment of individual Jews, including telephone threats and  assaults, he said, rose 41%, up from 324 incidents to 458 last year.    Acts of vandalism in California decreased 12%, from 137 incidents in 1987 to  121 last year, Lehrer said, but acts of harassment nearly doubled, rising from  26 to 49. So overall, anti-Semitic incidents in the state rose from 163 acts in  1987 to 170 last year.    Lehrer pointed out, however, that the decrease in vandalism failed to  counteract the 121% increase shown in California between 1986 and 1987.    Incidents tallied in the report included arson at a Fullerton synagogue; bomb  threats to synagogues in Fullerton and La Jolla; explosion of a pipe bomb on  the grounds of a Florida synagogue, and the beating and stabbing of a  19-year-old Yeshiva University student in New York.    Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, whom Lehrer credited partially for  the decrease in vandalism here, said he disagreed with the idea that hate  groups should be ignored because focusing attention on them only increases  their numbers.    ""The way to deal with them is to jump on them at the very beginning,"" Reiner  said. ""You have to disrupt them and disorganize them and not give them the  luxury of allowing them to organize.""    Lehrer said the arrest record for anti-Semitic offenders is improving, with 124  arrests last year, compared to 78 nationally in 1987. Reiner said two such  offenders were sent to prison last year in Los Angeles County.    Although the skinhead youth groups are growing, Reiner said: ""It is one thing  to be a member of a group and espouse a certain philosophy and another to act.

Lehrer attributed the overall increase in anti-Semitic acts last year to hatred  stirred up by national and international events:    * Growth of skinhead gangs, which the league claims has 2,000 members active in  21 states. Forty-one incidents in 15 states last year were attributed to the  group.    * The Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, which the group said  sparked 117 incidents against Jews in the United States, including arson, bomb  threats and phone or mail threats.    * The 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the Nazi destruction of synagogues and  other Jewish property in Germany and Austria.

This outrageous act, which reminds the Arabs and Muslims of  the Dayr Yasin Massacre in 1948, emphasizes to the whole world  the extreme seriousness of the continuing Israeli occupation of  the territories and settling in it in contravention of all laws  and statutes and as a flagrant challenge to the UN resolutions  and Charter.    It has become clear to the entire international community  that Israel's intransigent stands, expansionist aims, and the  policies of evasion and procrastination which it has been  following in the peace talks for more than two years are the  primary cause of the acts of violence in the occupied Arab  territories. Israel is responsible, directly or indirectly, for  extremism in the region.    Syria, which is aware that the whole world deplores this  savage massacre, is well aware that words of denunciation and  condemnation are not enough to end the circles of violence and  terror, and that an end to the Israeli occupation without  further procrastination and stalling within the framework of the  current peace talks [fi itari muhadathat al-salam al-jariyah]  and allowing the Palestinian people to acquire their right of  self-determination will ensure ending extremism and acts of  violence and realizing just and comprehensive peace in the  region.

The  massacre could be avoided and the local mix commission as well  as the group of the Albanian and Serbian experts observed that  the victims carried with themselves no weapon or any other  defensive means.

On this day, all people across the country extend the  greatest honor to our Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il,  who leads the Army and people with boundless boldness,  steel-like will, and outstanding resourcefulness and, thus,  strongly defends the country's independence and national  dignity. They also extend warm congratulations to the heroic  People's Army officers and men who are defending the  fatherland's defense lines like an impregnable fortress.    The invincibility of the revolutionary cause of the working  class depends, to an important degree, on the invincibility of  the revolutionary armed forces which guarantee the fulfillment  of this cause with the force of arms. To people who aspire for  independence and are building socialism, nothing is more  honorable and prouder than having an powerful revolutionary army.    The bright future of the chuche revolutionary cause and our  fatherland's invincible might and high dignity are firmly  ensured militarily by the heroic KPA. The might of our People's  Army has not been further strengthened any other time than today  when it is marching under respected and beloved Supreme  Commander General Kim Chong-il. This is the great pride of our  people who are carrying out the revolution.    The respected and beloved leader and the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il are great in that they have raised our People's  Army into an invincible powerful army that can defeat any  aggression forces. This is also their great achievement.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded the Korean  People's Revolutionary Forces on 25 April in 1932, 62 years ago.  This was a historic event that gave birth to our party's  revolutionary armed forces, genuine chuche-type revolutionary  forces.    As a result of the founding of the Korean People's  Revolutionary Forces, our people's long-cherished desire to have  their own powerful armed forces was fulfilled brilliantly, and,  from that time, the proud history of the heroic KPA started.    Our revolutionary forces have walked along an honorable road  of struggle since declaring their birth throughout the world.  The over 60 years of the KPA's march were an honorable road  along which the KPA has won victory after victory while  overcoming numerous trials as dictated by the party and the  leader [suryong]. They were also brilliant annals in which it  has brought about immortal achievements for the fatherland and  the nation and the era and the revolution.    Our People's Army has always been able to honorably fulfill  its noble mission along a long road and has strengthened and  developed into a revolutionary invincible army. This was only  possible because there was the wise leadership of the respected  and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Our Army could win the two wars against powerful enemies and  strongly defend the independence of the country and the nation  because it was led by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song.    All brilliant revolutionary feats on this land are filled  with the blood and sweat of our People's Army officers and men  who have devotedly fought for the fatherland's freedom and  independence, the people's happiness, and a victory in the  anti-imperialist cause of independence. The People's Army's  immortal achievements--that it honorably fulfilled its historic  mission for the era and the revolution and the fatherland and  the people by displaying boundless loyalty toward the party and  the leader [suryong], a spirit of sacrifice, and indomitable  patriotism--will be eternally brilliant with the proud history  of the Korean revolution.    Our revolutionary armed forces, which were founded under  the leadership of the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim  Il-song and have traversed the path to glorious victory, have  come to a new high level in their own development by upholding  the great iron-willed commander General Kim Chong-il [widaehan  kangchorui yongjang Kim Chong-il changgun] as the supreme  commander.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Comrade Kim  Chong-il has the indomitable will, mettle, distinguished  resourcefulness and tactics [yonggunsul] befitting the supreme  commander of the revolutionary armed forces. Herein lies the  guarantee for the endless consolidation and development of and  ever-victoriousness of our revolutionary armed forces.    The invincibility of the revolutionary armed forces depends  upon the greatness of the supreme commander who is leading them.  When they uphold the great supreme commander, the armed forces  can become (?matchless) strong ones.    Today, our revolutionary armed forces pride themselves upon  being the ever-victorious, invincible revolutionary armed forces  which can smash any formidable enemy [kuotton chonha taejokto  chobushilsuinnun]. This is totally because we are upholding the  iron-willed commander General Kim Chong-il as our revolutionary  armed forces' supreme commander who embodies the features of an  outstanding military strategist and distinguished commander  [yongjang] at the noblest level.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, equipped with both  literary and military accomplishments, has paid much attention  to the work to consolidate and develop the People's Army--the  core of the self-reliant national defense capabilities--with the  fate of the country and the people on his shoulders from the  early days on, thereby carrying out energetic activities and  making immortal achievements.    Without the dear comrade leader's outstanding wisdom [yeji]  and refined tactics, we cannot talk about our People's Army  being the ranks of loyalty which are fighting by dedicating  their lives to the party and the leader [suryong] and about its  having been consolidated and developed into a  one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary armed force which can smash  any enemy, nor can we think of the fact that we have come to  have a firm military guarantee on which the socialist cause of  chuche can be firmly defended from generation to generation.    The immortal achievements made by our supreme commander  General Kim Chong-il in the implementation of the cause of  building our revolutionary armed forces lie, above all, in the  fact that he has brightly illuminated the future path, which our  People's Army should traverse, by putting forth the most correct  and original military ideologies and theories.    To illuminate the correct path to the building of our  revolutionary armed forces and to the victory of the  revolutionary war by putting forth correct military ideologies  and theories is the primary mission of the commander [yongyang]  who is leading the armed forces. The greatness of the commander  lies right in the greatness of military ideologies and of  strategies and tactics.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed and  enriched the chuche-oriented military ideologies and theories,  which the great leader created, on a wholesale scale with his  matchless, outstanding military wisdom and with his activities  denying himself sleep and rest.    The military ideologies and theories put forth by our  supreme  commander General Kim Chong-il are, in a thoroughgoing manner,  the chuche-oriented military ideologies based on the  masses-centered philosophical principle; are the encyclopedic  theories encompassing all sectors and all fields of building the  armed forces; and are the most scientific and revolutionary  theories whose justness and invincible vitality have remarkably  been corroborated in the revolutionary practice of our era.    Herein lies a comprehesive compilation about the  theoretical,  practical matters arising from the building of the revolutionary  armed foces of our era, ranging from the mission of the  revolutionary armed forces of the working class, to the  principles and methods in building the armed forces, and to the  complete displaying of the might of the revolutionary armed  forces.    To have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's outstanding  military ideologies and theories, which are consistent in terms  of their revolutionary and scientic nature, is the great fortune  of our people and People's Army.    As long as the chuche-oriented military ideologies and  theories illuminated by the dear comrade leader exist, our  revolutionary armed forces will reliably safeguard our socialist  cause, while firmly defending in an unflinching way their  revolutionary nature as the armed forces of the leader  [suryong], the party and the people under any circumstances.    Another immortal achievement of the iron-willed sagacious  supreme commander General Kim Chong-il accumulated along the  road of strengthening and developing our People's Army is having  strengthened and developed our revolutionary armed forces into a  matchlessly strong army fully prepared in political,  ideological, military, and technological aspects with his  outstanding and tested leadership.    The might of the revolutionary army is the political and  ideological might which can be most highly displayed when it is  combined with modern military technology. While ensuring  priority on the work of firmly preparing the People's Army in  political and ideological aspects, our comrade supreme commander  energetically led the work of strengthening its military and  technological aspects.    Due to the wise leadership of the supreme commander General  Kim Chong-il, our People's Army has been strengthened and  developed into a victorious army fully prepared in political and  ideological aspects as well as in military and technological  aspects.    Today, our People's Army's political and moral trait is  excellent. The entire Army is filled with loyalty toward the  party and the leader, and revolutionary military discipline is  being firmly maintained.    All the officers and men of the People's Army are highly  upholding the leadership of the comrade supreme commander with  revolutionary will of becoming bullets and bombshells to defend  the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander with their  lives, and are creating heroic feats and miracles in carrying  out their military duties.    There is no such an invincible army in this world like our  People's Army, which bears ardent loyalty and absolute worship  toward its supreme commander, and of which revolutionary  military discipline is thoroughly established so as to  unconditionally implement the supreme commander's order and  guidance without any ups and downs anytime under any  circumstances.    Our People's Army is fully prepared in military and  technological aspects. The People's Army is equipped with  modern weapons and combat technology equipment. All the  soldiers are skillfully handling their weapons and combat  technology equipment with deep military knowledge and  technology. It is a proud aspect of our People's Army to  display the mighty appearance of invincible revolutionary armed  forces possessing powerful offensive and defensive means, and  unique chuche-motivated war method.    Today, the might of our People's Army, which has been  strengthened and developed into a victorious army, gives faith  to our people and the world's revolutionary people. Our party  is able to persistently push forward with the struggle to  complete the chuche cause with firm determination because there  is the mighty People's Army. Our people are able to accelerate  the socialist construction with high spirit and strong  confidence in the fierce confrontation against the enemies  because they have the firm faith in the invincible might of the  People's Army.    In addition to strengthening the People's Army in various  ways, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, chairman of the DPRK  Defense Commission and supreme commander of the KPA, brilliantly  achieved the work of making all the people armored and  fortifying the entire country, thus firmly established an  all-people, all-country defensive system across the country, and  wisely led the work of building up a mighty, self-reliant  national defense industry. As a result, the entire country has  been literally turned into an impregnable fortress.    As long as we have our mighty, self-reliant national defense  power which has the matchless People's Army as the core, no  enemy can intrude our fatherland's security.    Another immortal achievement of our supreme commander  General  Kim Chong-il accumulated during the days of leading the cause of  military construction to brilliant victory is having further  consolidated the unity of ideology and will between the Army and  the people by thoroughly embodying the idea of the Army-people  unity.    How the Army and the people firmly unite in one mind and one  will is a decisive factor of the victory of revolution.    An army that does not receive support from the people  cannot sufficiently manifest its might even though it has  up-to-date equipment and will be defeated in every war.    In our country, the traditional virtue of Army-people unity  is wholly blossoming at a new high stage by highly upholding the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the benevolent father  [chaaeroun oboi] of our people and officers and men of the  People's Army, as the supreme commander. The officers and men  of our People's Army love the people whenever and wherever, are  devoting everything for the people's interest, and our people  are actively supporting and encouraging the People's Army both  materially and morally.    Our People's Army and people are verbally united together in  which they cannot be separated even it they wanted to, and there  is no power in this world that can break this great  single-hearted unity. We are able to easily defeat any powerful  enemy because of the single-hearted unity of the Army and people  impregnably united around the respected and beloved comrade  supreme commander.    Truly, General Kim Chong-il, the ever-victorious iron-willed  military commander, is an extraordinary military genius who  leads our revolutionary force toward brilliant victories and  glory. Through extraordinary wisdom and outstanding art of  commanding the Army, our comrade supreme commander has  brilliantly solved all problems arising in the construction of  the revolutionary armed force, and he resolutely smashed  [chitbusyoborisiotta] the enemies' challenge through our  peerless courage and iron-like will.    Even under the especially difficult condition in frustrating  the U.S. imperialists' maneuver of aggression and provocation  and in constructing socialism, the dear comrade leader provided  a peerless powerful army that can smash [ttaeryo pusilsuinnun]  any kind of enemy. Such achievement by the dear comrade leader  will eternally shed light along with the victorious advance of  the chuche cause.    While reflecting with deep sentiment upon the proud history  in which our revolutionary armed forces had walked, the officers  and men of our People's Army and all the people are feeling in  their hearts the extraordinary greatness of General Kim Chong-il  who is wholly embodying the trait and temperament of an  iron-like military commander, and are overflowing with the firm  determination to carry out the revolution to the end according  to the leadership of the comrade supreme commander.    Today we are faced with the heavy and honorary task of  further strengthening the revolutionary armed forces and to  achieve ahead of schedule the fatherland's independent  reunification and the ultimate victory in the chuche  revolutionary cause in accordance with the demand of the  prevailing situation.    Currently in our country, a tense situation is being created  in which we do not know when a war may break out at any time  because of the imperialists' vicious antisocialist and  antirepublic maneuvers. Reality demands that the might of our  People's Army must be all the more strengthened.    The People's Army is the core of the self-defensive national  defense capacity and a reliable defender of our party's cause.  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has firm faith in the  People's Army and is exerting efforts night and day to  strengthen and develop it so that the chuche revolutionary cause  can be completed to the end. We must all the more strengthen our  revolutionary armed force by brilliantly succeeding and  developing the immortal achievements in accumulating the cause  of military building by the respected and beloved comrade  supreme commander.    The comrade supreme commander's leadership is the life of  the  People's Army and a decisive element in the victory in military  building and military activities. All the officers and men of  the People's Army must highly uphold the comrade supreme  commander's leadership and must consistently adhere to the  party's line of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea.    All the soldiers must firmly arm themselves with the great  General Kim Chong-il's ideology and theory of military building,  and assimilate loyalty toward the comrade supreme commander as  their faith, consciousness, morality, and life to further  strengthen the political and ideological might of the People's  Army. Along with this, the whole Army's revolutionary army  trait of fulfilling to the end the order and instruction of the  comrade supreme commander by going through fire and water must  be all the more firmly established, and all the soldiers must be  prepared to become a man of combative spirit of  one-a-match-for-100.    Highly manifesting the virtue of unity between officers and  men and unity between the party and society is an important  guarantee in strengthening the might of our People's Army.    [Text] Commanders of the People's Army should treasure and  love their soldiers, sharing their fate, joys, and sorrows, and  soldiers should respect and follow their commanders. All party  members in the People's Army should be a model in their military  life and properly help and lead members of the Socialist Working  Youth League in the Army. Members of the league should emulate  the model of party members and should become models in  implementing the party's army building ideology and policy.    Singehearted unity is the basic principle of our revolution  and is an ever-victorious banner. We have consistently advanced  our revolution with the might of singlehearted unity around the  party and the leader [suryong] while surmounting multilayered  barriers.    Our people and all officers and men of the People's Army  should firmly safeguard and defend the tradition of our proud  singlehearted unity and glorify it generation after generation.    All people and officers and men of the People's Army should  uphold the leadership of General Kim Chong-il, the respected and  beloved supreme commander, with the single mind of loyalty and  filial piety and with the faith in certain victory that as long  as General Kim Chong-il, the respected and beloved supreme  commander, is with us we will win without fail. Thus, all the  people and all the Army should firmly unite as one mind and  resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong].    Unity between the Army and the people is the source of our  singlehearted unity. It is also a firm guarantee for the victory  of the revolutionary war.    The laudable tradition of the unity between the Army and the  people which is being enhanced in our society today is an  expression of their lofty mental world to share to the end  destiny with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il under any  difficult circumstances.    All the people and officers and men of the People's Army  should further bring our party's great ideology of unity between  the Army and the people into fuller bloom.    Soldiers of the People's Army should become genuine sons and  daughters who love the people and who fight for the people,  devoting their lives. The people should treasure and love  soldiers of the People's Army like blood brothers and should  actively help it.    Defending the socialist fatherland is a task by all of the  people.    As long as imperialism remains and as long as the reckless  war provocation maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and their  stooges continue we should not mitigate our alertness. All party  members and the working people should firmly arm themselves with  our party's chuche-oriented view on war and should firmly  establish in the whole society the ethos of attaching importance  to military affairs and learning military affairs fervently.  Thus, they should fully have political and ideological  preparations and military preparations, that is, material  preparations so as to cope with any unexpected situation.    National reunification is our people's supreme task that  should not be delayed even for a moment. Today, the South Korean  puppet clique is advancing toward the road of relying on outside  forces, not toward the road of national independence, while  turning away the desire for reunification of the nation. It is  attempting to stage a nuclear war exercise against our republic  in collusion with the U.S. imperialists. However, no matter what  a large-scale war exercise the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppet clique may try to stage and, thus, to drive  North-South relations to a dangerous phase they cannot block the  unanimous desire of the whole nation for reunification.    All of the people should sternly smash the antireunification  forces' maneuvers and should more vigorously fight to expedite  the day of national reunification.    The internal and external situation of our revolution is  still complicated and tense. However, we have nothing to fear.  Our revolutionary armed forces are the ones which have the habit  of being always victorious for some 60 long years. They are also  the ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces which uphold  General Kim Chong-il, the most famous general in the world, as  their supreme commander.    The future of our People's Army which is reliably defending  the chuche revolutionary cause under the leadership of the  respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who is the  most veteran and great leader of our times, and General Kim  Chong-il, the supreme commander, will await only brilliant  victory and glory.    Long live the 62d anniversary of the founding of the heroic  KPA.     "

A slogan of loyalty chanted by the whole Army today  vividly proves how resolute and strong are the spirit of  absoluteness and unconditionality, and faith and will of the  officers and men of the People's Army who are faithful to the  idea and leadership of the great General Kim Chong-il.    The People's Army today has grown into ever-victorious  revolutionary Armed Forces with the reliable commanding force  capable of skillfully organizing any operation and battle and  modern offensive and defensive means, taking the chuche-based  idea of Army building as the only guideline, and all the  soldiers are firmly prepared to be all-conquering combatants  capable of successfully discharging their military duties under  any circumstances, armed with the immortal chuche idea and  tactics of our style.    Today the situation of our revolution is very strained and  the challenge of the enemy is getting all the more wanton. But  as there is the heroic People's Army, powerful ranks of loyalty,  each man of which is a match for a hundred upholding the wise  guidance of comrade supreme commander, any grim difficulties can  never block our advance and even a large Army tens of millions  strong cannot provoke us.

The latest of these lies claimed that our heroic Armed  Forces  fired a missile on Aden, and that shrapnel from the missile,  which was exploded in the air by the so-called air defenses of  the rebellious, secessionist gang hit a number of worshipers in  Aden during dawn prayers.    This false and fabricated report, which aims at concealing  the crimes of this gang in a manner that exposes it, included a  statement by a citizen who was forced to speak on television and  said the explosion occurred while the worshipers were kneeling.

The source said the masses of our Yemeni people know who  shells mosques, and who tortured to death our esteemed religious  scholars, and who attacked Sanaa, Ta'izz and Zinjibar, as well  as al-Rahidah and 'Ataq with missiles, in addition to what  happened in the economic and commercial capital, Aden, in  January 1986 during the bloody coup against the legitimate  leadership of the Socialist party at that time.    Our people in all governorates also know those who have  renounced the values of our Islamic religion and all deep-rooted  norms and heritage throughout their known criminal history.     "
0,FT924-15813 ,"FT924-15813 _AN-CJBCAACPFT 921002   FT  02 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Warhorses relive heroic defeats - Ivo Dawnay listens to the old music of boos and jeers      By IVO DAWNAY   FOR just a few minutes, the Labour conference turned into its old self yesterday. And inevitably, it was the platform veterans - Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, and Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover - who brought the floor to its feet. With rip-roaring 'I-told-you-so' speeches on the relentless decline of the coal industry, the two warhorses invoked the spirit of the miners' strike and other heroic defeats. To top it off, there even followed a spat with the rightwing engineers, accompanied by the magical music of boos and jeers that, in the good old, bad old days, alerted the most somnolent reporters to the prospect of a front-page story. But, as has characterised this listless week in Blackpool, there was no real story, merely a bit of blowing off steam. 'What you saw there was a nostalgic look back at the past,' said Mr Alistair Darling, the new City spokesman on Labour's modernist wing. Labour's new conformism and the steely grip with which the new party leadership has established its authority has been the true and unspectacular story of the week. There have been a few fleeting gestures of resistance. Yesterday delegates arrived to find the union barons had fired a warning shot on reform of their block vote by passing a motion, all but ruling out any serious change to the party-union relationship. 'There is some unfinished business there,' Mr Stuart Bell, the Middlesbrough MP and another moderniser, remarked. Yet, elsewhere, there were some clues to the readiness of the party's newly emollient supreme authority to roll over and play the leadership's game. Another motion, calling for the maintenance of Clause IV - the highly totemic commitment to public ownership - was, largely unnoticed, voted down by 4.3m discredited block votes to 1.2m. Similarly discreetly, Blackpool '92 also voted for the conference's own emasculation. In consequence, a new mechanism for policymaking - dominated by the national executive committee and shadow cabinet under Mr John Smith's leadership - will reduce its future powers only to those of veto. Furthermore, Mr Smith - previously viewed as uninterested in party management - has demonstrated that the pace of a well-upholstered tortoise might well prove more effective than the hyperactive style of a Kinnock hare. That, together with the plight of the government, is Labour's good news. But the principal question mark that has dominated the past four days centres on whether Labour has done anything this week to alter an image as outdated and as unrepresentative of modern Britain as the redbrick seaside resort of Blackpool itself. Under a platform like something out of the Festival of Britain, Mr Smith's speech promoted the stolid values of the 1950s - moral, austere, pragmatic - but proved entirely devoid of signposts as to which way the party has to go. Long-time conference-goers have remarked that this year it has been flatter and duller than any they can remember. There has been no real debate of the causes that lay behind the April election defeat, or on how they should be addressed. Introspective, but shallowly so, Labour appears more and more like the Church of England - ready to change just enough to irritate some of the older traditionalists, but not sufficiently to win any new converts. Even new bloods like Mr Blair have felt obliged to recite the liturgy, while Mr Brown paid lip service with an unexplained and unconvincing promise to tackle the foreign exchange speculators. Not one frontbench spokesman addressed head-on how the individualist, not to say greedy, south of the country is to be persuaded to mend its ways. Or, alternatively, how Labour will mend its own. That, we are promised, will come next year. It is unfortunate, nonetheless, for the 'modernisers' that Scargill and Skinner proved the show's best double act.  The Financial Times   London Page 17  "

The forces of national  alignment were able to penerate the defenses of the Amaliqah and  cut their communications, leaving them without central direction.    Meanwhile, other information indicates that the Amaliqah  tried to retreat at Zinjibar, Lawdar, and Mudiyah with [word  indistinct] the resident civilian population [words indistinct]  children caused by this invasion by the Amaliqah of peaceful  homes [words indistinct] the attacks of the patriotic forces.

He added that the political leadership of the PLO must not  accept a compromise stand from President Clinton's  administration, noting that it must not respond to his call to  go to Washington.    Al-Hasan said that the bloodbath that occurred in the  Ibrahimi Mosque and the Juniyah massacre against Christian  worshipers are both part of an Israeli plan to create chaos in  the region on the road to establishing a new Israeli  geopolitical situation.    Al-Hasan called for escalating confrontations against the  Israeli enemy until the army begins to withdraw from our  territories--occupied since 1967--under UN supervision. He  noted that the escalation of confrontations and the shedding of  the heroic martyrs' blood will only be considered a turning  point if the current negotiations are immediately halted and the  Declaration of Principles signed in Oslo is terminated. There  can be no negotiations except those based on a comprehensive  solution and an immediate Israeli withdrawal from our beloved  homeland.    Al-Hasan urged the Egyptian Government to take measures, to  at least immediately withdraw its Egyptian ambassador from Tel  Aviv and to expel the Israeli ambassador from Cairo.    He called on the Palestinian political forces to meet in  order to draw the bases for a national unity aimed at escalating  the struggle and confrontation against the Israeli enemy.    Al-Hasan said: Fatah cadres inside and outside the occupied  territories should close their ranks and return to our  revolutionary and sound course.

The Israeli enemy escalated its acts of aggression  yesterday.  Enemy artillery bombarded several areas in the south, creating  severe tension in these areas amid reports from the occupied  border strip on Israeli military movements inside the strip.  According to security sources, Israeli enemy forces and agent  militia [South Lebanese Army] [SLA] increased their military  ground movements in the occupied strip and launched large raking  operations in the woods and beside the roads. These sources  noted that the enemy set up barriers beyond curves in the roads,  and Israeli and SLA soldiers searched cars and interrogated  passengers. In addition, the Israeli forces set up a new  center east of Tallusah, which the resistance men attacked with  rockets. Other enemy movements were spotted in the Hula area.    The UN Interim Forces in Lebanon [UNIFIL] reports confirmed  that the heavy Israeli bombardment continued yesterday and  covered the western, central, and eastern sectors, noting that  the UNIFIL areas of operation also came under the barrage,  including the Fijian contingent area of operations in  al-Mansuri, the Nepalese area in Rshaf, the Irish and Ghanaian  area in Majdal Silm, and the Finnish area in Wadi al-Siryan.  These acts of aggression were accompanied by hostile  overflights over various sectors of the south. Israeli  helicopters flew over the western sector of Tyre up to the  international border from midnight until early this morning.  The resistance retaliated by firing a number of missiles at the  border strip.     "

[Begin Uwilingiyimana recording] Ladies and gentlemen of  Rwanda, I deplore the insecurity that prevailed in the town of  Kigali today following the violence perpetrated by members of  some political parties that do not want to see the  implementation of the Arusha Accords. These wrongdoers, from  those political parties that do not support the return of peace  in our country, claimed that they aimed to stop a meeting to be  held by the Republican Democratic Movement. This meeting had  been authorized, and the security services had been informed in  order to maintain the security of people and their property. We  sympathize with those harassed and seriously injured persons,  whose number is not yet known. My condolences go to all those  whose family members may have died in these ignominious acts  perpetrated by the enemies of peace. I call upon the services of  the Ministry of Justice and those of the Defense Ministry to  undertake exhaustive investigations into today's events.    Ladies and gentlemen of Rwanda, be patient. Only two days  remain before the establishment of the transitional  institutions, namely the National Transitional Assembly and the  broad-based Transitional Assembly. The date which has been  eagerly awaited by the entire Rwandan people and the entire  international community is 22 February 1994. Thank you. [end  recording]     "

Smuggling has now become ""rampant""  along the coast, it admits in a paper, presented to the  International Maritime Organisation (IMO), but it says it has  investigated all incidents and, according to Chinese sources,  they were ""very complicated"".    The Maritime Safety Committee of the IMO will meet between  May 16-24 in London to consider what steps to take next in  combatting the growing menace of piracy in the region. Around  80 of the 149 members states are expected to attend, with China  sending a team from Beijing. Hong Kong, which has associate  status within the organisation, will send a team headed by Derek  Hall, a former director of the Marine Department.    According to the IMO, piracy in the region is still on the  increase, with 42 incidents reported in the east and south  regions of the China Sea in the seven months to the end of last  year -- out of 67 worldwide. IMO findings show 20 of them along  the coast north and south of Shanghai, with the majority of the  rest around the Philippines. Several countries have submitted  papers to the IMO, often detailing particular incidents.    But in a statement indicating what some will see as an  official reluctance to be too frank, the Chinese paper says:  ""The manifestations of the incidents were varied. Therefore it  is not proper to regard all these incidents as 'pirate attacks'  without investigation and evidence.    ""Some of the acts were fishermen's disputes; others were  misconduct by a few law enforcement officers while discharging  their duties. The misconduct cases have been seriously  investigated and proper action has been taken by the Chinese  Government.    ""However, such incidents were very rare, and should not be  exaggerated as acts of piracy and there should be a clear  distinction between such acts and the policy of the Chinese  Government.""    The Chinese Government has never commented on smuggling or  piracy to the IMO in the past but in its paper it gives an  assurance: ""The Government will as always take effective  measures to curb and suppress any unlawful activities  (smuggling, piracy and armed robbery) which may sabotage peace  and order.""    It says some incidents ""were normal law enforcement  activities carried out by the Chinese law enforcement  departments against foreign smuggling vessels"".    China does not mention Hong Kong but it adds: ""The reactions  in this regard were different. Some of the normal  anti-smuggling activities were maliciously labelled as piratical  acts."" The paper claims some incidents may have been caused by  what it describes as ""black ships"" disguised as Chinese vessels.  China and Japan had been co-operating in the investigation and  suppression of such incidents.    It adds: ""Some reports and statistics regarding the  incidents of piracy in China's coast were groundless and very  irresponsible.    ""The Chinese Public Security Force is a highly disciplined  and law abiding force.    ""The Chinese navy is also a highly disciplined and armed  national defence force and usually does not participate in  anti-smuggling activities at sea, not to mention the possibility  of robbing ships.""

This proves the criminal nature of  the Jews, who do not hesitate to commit the ugliest crimes,  violate the most sacred values, kill women and children, and  kidnap peaceful civilians.    Today the Zionist entity committed a new crime added to its  list of abominable crimes and aggressive acts, including the  acts of kidnapping and piracy with which its history is replete.    The statement added: This ugly crime is the clearest picture  and the most eloquent expression of the official terrorism  exercised by the Zionist entity backed by the global arrogant  forces, above all the United States.    The crime was committed after an official decision was  issued  by the enemy government, which pursues terrorism as a firm  policy in dealing with the peoples of this region. This proves  the criminal nature of the Zionist entity and the occupying  Jews, who are supported by the global arrogant forces.    The statement continued: This crime has proved that there is  no place in Lebanon safe from the Zionist danger, which is  threatening everyone. This means we must consider all of  Lebanon as a confrontational area in which our people must  maintain constant resistance against the Jewish threat.     "

The log-jam has been responsible for a dramatic slowdown this year of foreign investment in India. The fund manager, Martin Currie, is to raise an additional Dollars 150m through an issue of convertible preference shares in the Indian Opportunities Fund. The IOF, managed jointly by Martin Currie and Indian merchant bank Indbank, raised Dollars 100m in an initial placing of ordinary shares last July. A further tranche planned for earlier this year had to be postponed after difficulty arose at custodial banks in India. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, the leading custodial bank in India, which acts as Martin Currie's custodian, told its customers it was temporarily unable to handle any further increase in foreign investments in India. Custodial banks hold share certificates for safe keeping, collect dividends and follow instructions to pass shares to new owners when they are sold. In India each share has its own certificate and the volume of paper this creates has raised serious administrative burdens for large, active institutional investors. Martin Currie has struck an agreement with Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, which acts as a sub-custodian for several large US banks. The local fund managers will have a period of six months in which to invest cash raised by the latest issue.   Companies:-  Martin Currie.     Indian Opportunities Fund.     Indbank.

Capt. Paredes, who retired from the Navy a few years ago,  became known for his public charges of corruption in the Navy  when he presented Congress copies of videos on connections  between political leaders and drug traffickers. He confirmed  that ""the DEA works with drug traffickers outside U.S. and  Bolivian laws.""    ""I say it, I confirm it, and I can prove it"" said Paredes  Sempertegui, a MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] member who is  currently as adviser to the Chamber of Deputies Defense  Committee, in asserting that DEA agents and Bolivian policemen  carry out ""their well-known extortion operations.""    He said the criminal acts ""are made in the so-called  security  houses located all over the national territory. These acts are  known by the public.

Paredes explained that his charges refer to specific people  and facts that in no way compromise national institutions, for  which he said he has respect and consideration, mentioning the  Armed Forces and National Police primarily.    He said the investigation announced on this case by  legislative committees will certainly confirm his charges and  will clarify the real operation of the ""security houses,"" which  are completely outside the country's legal order.

The meeting was chaired by Raul Castro Ruz, second secretary of  the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and Minister of the FAR. The  meeting concluded with a solemn and moving ceremony to promote  Enrique Carreras Rolas, a hero of the Republic of Cuba, to the  rank of division general.    The military council made the final assessment of all the  activities of the FAR during 1993, which had already been  previously analyzed in the last days of the mentioned year. The  review demonstrated the gigantic and fruitful effort in the  three armies with all the types of weapons that defend the  national territory, which shows a strengthening of the combat  capacity and readiness to successfully wage the people's war in  case of enemy aggression.    Significant progress was achieved in the combat readiness of  the personnel, which in Cuba includes millions of men and women  of the FAR and the reserves of the Territorial Troops Militia  [MTT] and the production and defense brigades.    Last year's maintenance and conservation of equipment and  arms and preparation of the theater of military operations  demanded arduous and intense labor that included several million  weapons and war equipment and the mobilization of hundreds of  thousands of men and women in the country to build the people's  defense tunnels and other fortifications.    These heroic deeds performed in 1993 are a continuation of  the heroic deeds achieved in the two previous years. The results  of the three years as a whole have elevated the vitality of the  combat arms and equipment, and the protection of these by the  combatants and the civil population in the face of eventual  enemy aggression. All this was achieved in midst of the  shortages of the special period.    Another important point on the agenda was the FAR's  activities in the agricultural-livestock areas, which are aimed  at achieving self-sufficiency among the troops. As in the past  year, the food production goals for 1994 represent a 30 percent  increase, which would get the FAR closer to its goal of becoming  completely self sufficient. Great emphasis was placed on all  military agricultural-livestock enterprises working towards  reducing costs and increasing productivity and yields, which is  the only way to achieve affordability and profitability. It was  mentioned that the Youth Labor Army [EJT] cares for 15,000  caballerias of land throughout the country and that they produce  632,000 tons of food annually for the national economy.    The reduction of the military budget by 50 percent was  another encouraging observation that the council session made.  This contributes to reducing the deficit of the state budget.  The elevated conduct of discipline and the moral and political  state of the troops were described as satisfactory. The council  was happy to verify that the work of the FAR's restructuring to  adapt itself to the current conditions of the national economy  was done as planned, while achieving the goal of maintaining the  defensive power of the country and perfecting the FAR's  efficiency and combat disposition, deepening even more the  doctrinal and tactical concepts of the people's war.    The homage to General Carreras, on the occasion of his 50th  anniversary as a combat pilot, highlighted his clean record, his  stand against the Nazi-fascist movement, Batista's dictatorship,  and U.S. imperialism, and his elevated patriotism, and  revolutionary spirit. These feelings successively made him a  combat pilot during World War II and the struggle against the  fascist aggressors. He joined the national army when its role  was defined by the Constitution of 1940 as body for the defense  of national sovereignty. He joined the conspiracy that emerged  from the heart of that army, as a rejection to Batista's  military coup and was jailed by the tyranny for refusing to bomb  the insurgent population of Cienfuegos.    In the unequal air combat against the mercenary aggression  at the Bay of Pigs, Carreras had the opportunity he had hoped  for since his youth: defend national independence in the most  audacious and risky situation in the skies of the fatherland. He  shot down two B-26 airplanes and made serious attacks on the  enemy naval group. His heroism in those battles and his  extensive record of service to the Revolution made him worthy of  the title: hero of the Republic of Cuba. Carreras, who is 71  years old, continues to be an active member of the FAR. He is  one of those generals that die with their boots on.    Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first substitute  to  the Minister of the FAR and head of the General Staff, concluded  the ceremony with these words:    [Begin Rosales recording] I am sure that I speak for the  Minister of the FAR and all those present when I say that  together with the fearlessness and courage, honesty and firmness  of principles, General Carreras has the virtue of modesty and  trustworthiness of which he has become a true model and which  has never been tarnished by the deserved promotions and  recognitions, including the honorary title of Hero of the  Republic of Cuba. For that reason, I would like to conclude my  speech by expressing to Division General Enrique Carreras Solas  that our party, the people, and their FAR are proud to have you  among its generals. We, the officers of the FAR, are honored to  be able to be your comrade in arms, and disciples of your  personal example. Thank you very much. [applause] [end recording]    Present at the ceremony were Retired Division General  (Hector  Rios Eregnu). (Rios), who is a retired officer of the sister  Republic of Argentina, is in Cuba with his family on a private  visit and was invited by the Minister of the FAR to attend the  ceremony.     "

Dennis Barrie, on trial with the Contemporary Arts Center on obscenity charges,  said he and the gallery's board had talked about the controversy that an  exhibit of the photos had caused in Washington, D.C.    The government-supported showing of Mapplethorpe's photos was canceled last  year in Washington amid a debate over federal funding of art.    However, Barrie said the gallery's board strongly supported going ahead with  the exhibit.    ""This was an exhibition of high quality. It had been seen in other cities and  was by a well-known artist,"" Barrie testified under questioning by his lawyer  in Hamilton County Municipal Court.    Seven photographs in the 175-photo exhibit, ""Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect  Moment,"" are at the center of the trial. Five show graphic sex acts involving  men, and two show children whose genitals are exposed.    Under cross-examination by assistant city prosecutor Frank Prouty, Barrie  restated the gallery's commitment to displaying the photos.    ""I thought we had every right and every reason to bring this exhibition to this  city,"" he said.    Prouty showed Barrie Mapplethorpe's five photographs of explicit sex acts and  asked Barrie to comment on them.    ""He knew about light. He knew about shadow . . . . As difficult as the subject  matter may be, you see the ability of the man working through. He was brilliant  with a camera,"" Barrie said.

Dennis Barrie, on trial with the Contemporary Arts Center on obscenity charges,  said he and the gallery's board had talked about the controversy that an  exhibit of the photos had caused in Washington, D.C.    The government-supported showing of Mapplethorpe's photos was canceled last  year in Washington amid a debate over federal funding of art.    However, Barrie said the gallery's board strongly supported going ahead with  the exhibit.    ""This was an exhibition of high quality. It had been seen in other cities and  was by a well-known artist,"" Barrie testified under questioning by his lawyer  in Hamilton County Municipal Court.    Seven photographs in the 175-photo exhibit, ""Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect  Moment,"" are at the center of the trial. Five show graphic sex acts involving  men, and two show children whose genitals are exposed.    Under cross-examination by assistant city prosecutor Frank Prouty, Barrie  restated the gallery's commitment to displaying the photos.    ""I thought we had every right and every reason to bring this exhibition to this  city,"" he said.    Prouty showed Barrie Mapplethorpe's five photographs of explicit sex acts and  asked Barrie to comment on them.    ""He knew about light. He knew about shadow . . . . As difficult as the subject  matter may be, you see the ability of the man working through. He was brilliant  with a camera,"" Barrie said.    Judge David Albanese told the jury to expect to get the case today.

The NSC chief made the statement at a seminar on ""Policy and  Guidelines on International Terrorism"" which was jointly  organised by the NSC and the Interior Ministry.    The seminar at Government House was attended by about 450  senior government offices, provincial governors and high-level  authorities concerned with international terrorism.    Gen Charan said that since 1972 there have been eight  incidents regarded as acts of international terrorism, the last  being the huge water-tank bomb containing C-4 plastic explosives  found in a truck in front of Lumphini police station in March  this year.    Most of the events involved the hijacking of aircraft. In  these events, Thailand had never been a party in the conflict,  he said.    For example, the water-tank bomb was aimed at an embassy by  terrorists from another country who chose to use Thailand as the  venue for their activities, he added.    Gen Charan said that Thailand, as a member of the  International Terrorism Suppression Organisation, has exchanged  information and intelligence on activities and identities of  blacklisted international terrorists.    The NSC itself has coordinated with the National  Intelligence  Agency and Police Department on this matter but people in  general are usually unaware of such activities, he said.    Gen Charan said Thailand has a policy of not wanting to see  any terrorist activities in the country. If an event of this  nature takes place, Thailand would solve the problem in a way it  can to maintain the country's interests.     "

Capt. Paredes, who retired from the Navy a few years ago,  became publicly known for his charges of corruption in the Navy  when he presented Congress copies of videos on connections  between political leaders and drug traffickers. He confirmed  that ""the DEA works with drug traffickers outside U.S. and  Bolivian laws.""    ""I say it, I confirm it, and I can prove it"" said Paredes  Sempertegui, a MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] member who is  currently an adviser to the Chamber of Deputies Defense  Committee, in asserting that DEA agents and Bolivian policemen  carry out ""their well-known extortion operations.""    He said the criminal acts ""are made in the so-called  security  houses located all over the national territory. These acts are  known by the public. For example, in Santa Cruz I would like to  point out the house of a Bolivian Navy member rented for that  purpose. It is the house of Colonel Alberto Latelier Ortiz.""    Paredes explained that his charges refer to specific people  and facts that in no way compromise national institutions, for  which he said he has respect and consideration, mentioning the  Armed Forces and National Police primarily.    He said the investigation announced on this case by  legislative committees will certainly confirm his charges and  will clarify the real operation of the ""security houses,"" which  are completely outside the country's legal order.

Four years and a day after the Chernobyl disaster, marrow donated by a  42-year-old woman was flown to Seattle on Friday for transfusion into Anatoly  Grishchenko.    The marrow arrived at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on a British Airways  flight originating in Paris.    The marrow arrived one day after the fourth anniversary of the Chernobyl  nuclear disaster in the Ukraine. The transplant procedure was expected to take  from two to 10 hours.    In September, 1988, Grishchenko was found to have a pre-leukemia condition,  typified by low counts of blood platelets needed for clotting and of white  blood cells to fight infection and disease.    Grishchenko, 53, is the first Chernobyl victim to receive medical care in the  United States. He has up to a 75% chance of survival without a recurrence of  the condition for five years, said Susan Edmonds of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer  Research Center.    The transplant was arranged by Cap Parlier, light helicopter testing and  evaluation director for McDonnell Douglas Corp., who said he spoke with  Grishchenko by telephone a few hours before the transfusion was set to begin.    The Soviet civilian helicopter test pilot, who arrived at Hutchinson on April  11, underwent a final round of radiation therapy Friday afternoon, Parlier  said.    Grishchenko was honored as a Soviet hero for making five flights over Chernobyl  in the four days after an explosion and fire at the reactor on April 26, 1986.

In addition to Michael Friedman, member of the Presidium of the  Central Council of Jews in Germany, who advocated a ban of the  Republikaner in the Cologne newspaper EXPRESS, Deputy Social  Democratic Party of Germany Chairwoman Herta Daeubler-Gmelin  demanded, on Western German Radio on Friday [8 April], that the  Republikaner be declared a right-wing extremist party.    In the meantime, Bavarian Justice Minister Hermann Leeb  (Christian Social Union) has supported the decision by the  Landshut public prosecutor's office not to initiate  investigations against Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber  for instigating people. [passage omitted] Leeb rejected  criticism of the public prosecutor's office as unjustified. In  assessing facts the office cannot orient itself toward political  demands or statements, he stressed.    Christian Democratic Union [CDU] member Friedman said,  regarding the findings by the North Rhine-Westphalian Office for  the protection of the Constitution about acts of violence  committed by Republikaner: ""I think that Republikaner  functionaries are people who commit verbal acts of violence,  indirectly increase xenophobic prejudices, and thus provoke  violence. Political functionaries and their groups, which stand  outside the Basic Law with their statements, must be banned.""    Speaking to the press in Bonn on Friday, a spokesman for the  FRG Interior Ministry did not want to comment on the status of  the party in the current Constitutional Protection Report. He  pointed to the presentation of the report planned for next week.

El Chacal;  place and date not given; from the ""This Morning"" newscast]    [Text] Mr. Jose Angel Talavera:    The socioeconomic woes you say prompted all of you to take  up  arms will not be resolved by following a bloody path, because  instead of creating the necessary conditions to overcome the  dire poverty our peasants live in, fighting will worsen the  situation because of the mourning, hatred, and pain that every  war triggers.    There are more convincing and effective means, if they are  well-organized with the definite support of the peasants, to  demand and defend the rights that we all have as Nicaraguans.  I, as well as those around me, will never allow you to be  neglected or ignored once you disarm, as is the case with former  Army members and with former Nicaraguan resistance members.    The stability we are all striving for must not solely  benefit  the traditionally powerful and wealthy people from the  countryside and the city. Instead, it must basically benefit  the workers who, along with the heroic Nicaraguan peasants,  constitute the essential foundation of the Nicaraguan nation's  life.    On behalf of the General Staff and the Military Council of  the EPS [Sandinist People's Army], I guarantee respect for and  protection of the lives and assets of all those who disarm  immediately to rejoin the country's everyday life. We will  support the mechanisms agreed upon with you in order that you  will feel truly certain that the personal safety of each one of  you will be guaranteed.    The Nicaraguan fatherland and people require absolute peace.  I am sure that you will contribute to achieving this absolute  peace by disarming with dignity and by later striving in a  civilized manner for peace, which is in jeopardy because of the  severe unemployment and socioeconomic inequalities that all  Nicaraguans face.    [Signed] Sincerely, Army General Humberto Ortega Saavedra,  Commander in Chief of the EPS     "

We also wish to warn certain elements, which are  exacerbating  this situation by attacking members of opposition parties or  Tutsis. By this we mean that at this moment, Rwandans are being  persecuted, or perhaps even killed, because of their political  or ethnic affiliations. These acts of violence are mainly  attributed to sections of the Presidential Guard, who are backed  by government soldiers.    To safeguard the peace process initiated in our country, all  these acts of violence must cease immediately. This is the only  effective means of resolving Rwanda's problems. Every kidnapped  individual and his family must be released immediately.    If these demands are not met, or if the relevant authorities  fail to get the situation under control, the RPF and its army  will be compelled to take all necessary steps to carry out a  sacred duty -- that of protecting the country's innocent  citizens. We hope that reason will prevail over passion and  that everyone will realize that neither violence nor war can  help us solve Rwanda's problems.     "

The movement was created in  reaction to acts of violence perpetrated by Tuareg rebels  against members of the black community in northern Mali. The  community has, therefore, decided to assume responsibility for  its own security. Boubacar Guidado Toure, a spokesman for  (Ganda Koi), elaborates on the objectives of the movement:    [Begin recording] [Toure] The movement is not meant to  harass  or harm the people, but to restore peace in northern Mali  because the government is incapable of restoring peace there.  Since the signing of the national pact, no day has gone by  without attacks taking place or vehicles being taken away from  their owners. Each time we are told that the perpetrators of  those acts are armed groups. We know that plans for these  attacks are hatched here in Bamako. We have, therefore, created  the movement to stop such attacks. We will use the same means  the rebels are using.    [Unidenfied correspondent] What do you mean?    [Toure] I mean that we are prepared to take up arms and  fight  them.    [Correspondent] So, do you have weapons?    [Toure] Yes, we have weapons. [end recording]    Meanwhile, officials of the Unified Movement and Front of  Azaouad [MFUA] say they do not understand the real motivation  behind the creation of (Ganda Koi), but stress that they are  prepared to fight those who will attack them.

[passage omitted]    Answering a question about the relationship between Hamas  and  the alliance of the 10 factions, Abu-Marzuq said: We have a  good relationship despite recent reports casting doubt on this  relationship, which will remain pivotal for us.    Abu-Marzuq further stressed that Hamas seeks to develop this  relationship so the alliance can undertake its important jihad  role to defeat the Oslo and Cairo accords, as an indispensable  step before resuming the plan of liberation.    Abu-Marzuq, who had just heard about the unjust Zionist  bombing of the [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]  General Command positions in al-Na'imah, expressed his sympathy  and solidarity with the heroes of the General Command, saying:  We complement each other in the same trench and course.  [passage omitted]    On the fate of the 10 factions that oppose the settlement if  a Syrian-Israeli agreement is reached, Abu-Marzuq said he rules  out the possibility of such agreement in the short run,  considering the solid Syrian position. He stressed, however,  that the major organizational body of Hamas is inside the  occupied territories. Therefore, it remains free from influence  by any Palestinian or Arab agreements.    Commenting on the entry of the Palestinian police force into  Gaza and Jericho, Abu-Marzuq said: These forces are from the  sons of the Palestinian people and some of them fought heroic  battles for liberation. Therefore, we will welcome their  presence among the people there as long as they are protecting  the people's security. This position will change if these forces  change their attitude and turn into political forces to suppress  strugglers and opponents from various national and Islamic  political currents and persuasions.

In absence of his client, Manush Myftiu's attorney read the  defence saying of his defendant and though he did not accepted  the charge, he said that he considers the jury's decision to be  reasonable and requested that the decision should be take his  health into consideration.    Adil Carcani's attorney requested the innocence of his  client, trying to justify the acts of which he is accused. In  regard to the part of treatment of the Hoxha family, after the  death of the dictator [Enver Hoxha], the attorney said if the  Central Committee secretary and the chairman of the former  government decided for such a treatment, the purposes were very  noble and dignified for the Albanian nation.    Kleanthi Koci, Ramiz Alia's attorney, pointed out that this  process is of a great importance for the history of the Albanian  nation. Attorney Koci supports the innocence of his client  saying that he has not found elements of crime and genocide  carried out by Ramiz Alia. He said that Ramiz Alia had agreed  with the special treatment of the former leadership, had  approved the platform of the former secret police, and had made  democratic improvements in it. Koci said that Ramiz Alia had  approved the anti-religious and anti- constitutional movement in  the 1967, and had agreed with the treatment of the Hoxha family  after the death of the dictator, all of these acts in the  context of his official duties. Attorney Koci appreciated the  figure of his client as a former president though Prosecutor  Fana has made clear in the first session that Ramiz Alia is not  being accused of any acts he committed during the time he was  president.    The attorney of defendants Rita Marko and Hekuran Isai did  not accepted the decision of the pretence for defendant Rita  Marko [as received] saying that it is a partial attitude toward  this client because as he said, the state of health of Rita  Marko is the same as those of A. Carcanit and M. Myftiu. The  attorney said he believes that the jury will declare a suspended  sentence for defendant Rita Marko.    Hekuran Isai's attorney said that his client does not accept  the charge for legal reasons.    The attorney of Aranit Cela tried to justify the activity of  the Internment-Expulsion Commission.    The defence attorney of Rapi Mino spoke once again for the  way of proceeding of the State Commission for  Interment-Expulsion based on the analyses made by him and  witnesses during the judicial investigations.    The attorney of defendant Veiz Haderi did not accepted the  charge against his client.    During the yesterday's seance, the defendants also expressed  last saying [as received]. Speaking for half an hour, Ramiz  Alia considered his charge as a staged and spoke of past and  current current Albanian policy. Ramiz Alia did not mentioned  the parts of the accusation against him, because as he said at  the beginning, the sentence and its measure were of no  importance for him, but avoiding the trial's issues he spoke of  the actions for constructing the railways, for the last  elections in Libofsha commune, for the Anti-Fascist National  Liberation War and its anniversaries.    The decision for the 10 former high communist functionaries  will be declared on Tuesday, June 28, 1994.     "

Thus People for  the Ethical Treatment of Animals' (PETA) position paper on ""Circuses: Three  Rings of Abuse,"" begins.    Besides spending much of their lives in cages, legally required to be only  large enough for the animals to stand and turn around, in transit the climatic  conditions around the country force the animals to face radical shifts of both  heat and cold (bears especially suffer from heat, lions from cold) that would  not normally be encountered under ""free range"" (natural) conditions. During the  off-season, animals may be kept in crates, barn stalls or trucks, as few  circuses desire to put much money into comfortable winter housing.    As for training, physical punishment is giving way to mental control to teach  entertaining ""tricks."" However, some animals are less adaptable to various  training techniques and are stressed enough to require drugging and tooth  removal in order to make them manageable. As for the ""tricks"" themselves, bears  balancing on balls, apes riding motorcycles, elephants standing on two legs --  are physically uncomfortable and behaviorally unnatural.    After the animals have outlived their usefulness, they are permanently kept in  winter housing, or, more likely, sold to other circuses, zoos, private  menageries, game farms (to be shot for recreation or ""exotic"" meat) or even  research laboratories.

Thus People for  the Ethical Treatment of Animals' (PETA) position paper on ""Circuses: Three  Rings of Abuse,"" begins.    Besides spending much of their lives in cages, legally required to be only  large enough for the animals to stand and turn around, in transit the climatic  conditions around the country force the animals to face radical shifts of both  heat and cold (bears especially suffer from heat, lions from cold) that would  not normally be encountered under ""free range"" (natural) conditions. During the  off-season, animals may be kept in crates, barn stalls or trucks, as few  circuses desire to put much money into comfortable winter housing.    As for training, physical punishment is giving way to mental control to teach  entertaining ""tricks."" However, some animals are less adaptable to various  training techniques and are stressed enough to require drugging and tooth  removal in order to make them manageable. As for the ""tricks"" themselves, bears  balancing on balls, apes riding motorcycles, elephants standing on two legs --  are physically uncomfortable and behaviorally unnatural.    After the animals have outlived their usefulness, they are permanently kept in  winter housing, or, more likely, sold to other circuses, zoos, private  menageries, game farms (to be shot for recreation or ""exotic"" meat) or even  research laboratories. They spend the balance of their lives in confinement,  coercion and misery.    Overseas, animals in entertainment have been restricted or banned in several  countries, including Sweden and Denmark. In England, circuses with animal acts  are often denied public space.    CRAIG HUMPHREY    Advocate for Coalition    for Animal Rights; Experienced    Long Beach      Letter to the Editor    "

Fatah hawks also sent a warning to settlers in the occupied  Palestinian territories that says: As of 28 February, you are  being pursued wherever you are. Our fighters will pursue you  and the occupation army and other security bodies will not  protect you.    The warning says: It is time for retribution.

THEY FOCUS ON THE  DIVERSE PEOPLES, CONDITIONS.      By TERRY PRISTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SPARKS, Nev.      Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear.    When profit-hungry white settlers, heavily subsidized by the federal  government, invaded the West -- ravaging the environment, depleting natural  resources, conquering the various other peoples who had arrived there before  them, and planting the seeds for many of the problems the region faces today.    Turning their backs on the heroic frontier story as told in countless movies, a  new generation of scholars has rejected the notion that the West was ""tamed""  through an unbroken series of triumphs and acts of individual courage.    Their perspective, being heard in college classrooms around the country, may  well be ""making John Wayne spin around in his coffin,"" as Dallas Times-Herald  columnist Molly Ivins approvingly told a recent gathering of historians here.  It is also breathing new life into a once moribund academic field.    In 1893, historian Frederick Jackson Turner announced that a key chapter of  American history had ended three years earlier, because as census figures  showed, no more unsettled land remained in the Great West -- in other words,  the frontier days had come to an end. For much of the time since then, Western  history was taught as a single, triumphant process of settlement that came to a  halt a century ago.    What was overlooked, most of the so-called new Western historians say, is the  continuing, and far richer, story of a distinct and increasingly important  region ""washed by successive waves of emigrants who have been moving, settling  and adapting to the country for at least 25,000 years,"" as historian Elliot  West of the University of Arkansas puts it.    The ""new"" historians, led by media-conscious Patricia Nelson Limerick, 39, of  the University of Colorado, and shaped by the politics of the Vietnam era,  focus on what was omitted from the legends. They explore the settlers' failures  -- economic and moral -- the environmental consequences, the role of the  federal government, the resilience of native peoples and other ethnic groups  and the part played by women.    To these scholars, Gen. George A. Custer was more fool than martyr, and the  missionaries who died at the hands of the Indians -- such as Narcissa and  Marcus Whitman, who were massacred with 12 others by the Cayuse in 1847 --  contributed to their demise by their misguided attempt to do good works.    The revisionist view has been attacked as neither new nor true to history. Most  of it has been expressed before, but probably not in as coherent and forceful a  fashion. Despite their reservations, many academics at the Western History  Assn. meeting last month grudgingly conceded that Limerick, known to her  colleagues as Patty, and the other mavericks have brought new -- and measurable  -- respectability and excitement to a discipline once derided on many campuses  as ""cowboys and Indians.""    ""Patty's done more to publicize what we do and bring it to the attention of the  American public than anyone who's been writing Western history for the last 50  years,"" said Paul Andrew Hutton of the University of New Mexico, who still sees  value in teaching frontier history. ""My graduate students think Patty walks on  water.""    Revisionism has been the subject of cover stories in three national  publications during the last eight months. (since March 18)    Eagerly, if nervously anticipated, are two books scheduled to be published next  year by Western historians William Cronon of Yale University and Richard White  of the University of Washington that are widely expected to set new standards  in the field. Along with Limerick and Donald Worster of the University of  Kansas, Cronon and White are part of what some refer to as the Gang of Four.    As further evidence of the hoopla, an estimated 700 people -- 200 more than  last year -- exchanged shoptalk and ideas against an unlikely backdrop of slot  machines and blackjack tables at a casino hotel near Reno. Western history  buffs in bolo ties, many of them members of an international organization known  as the Westerners, used to predominate at the annual Western history meeting,  which welcomes amateurs as well as academics. This year, perhaps as a  reflection of the growing prestige of the field, non-academics were a distinct  minority.    Many participants were drawn by a non-traditional program organized by Limerick  around such topics as the black population of Orange County, being Indian in  the 20th Century, the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the  novelist's ""advantage"" in understanding the West, and a much-debated proposal  to turn the Great Plains into a national park.    What some historians describe as a revolution in their field was sparked three  years ago by the publication of Limerick's ""The Legacy of Conquest,"" a  synthesis, as she is the first to admit, of other scholars' research, seen from  a revisionist perspective. Limerick is a Banning native whose long straight  hair, barrettes and fondness for paisley are a throwback to her undergraduate  days at UC Santa Cruz. She forthrightly sought not only to bury Turner's  frontier thesis once and for all but also to emphasize what she sees as a  continuity in the region's history.    Turner -- who in 1895 at the University of Wisconsin became the first professor  ever to teach Western history -- wrote in 1893 that population figures derived  from the latest census proved that the frontier, the ""meeting point between  savagery and civilization,"" was closed because no large tracts of land remained  unsettled. It was the advance westward, Turner said, that had turned Europeans  into Americans and imbued this country with its individualistic, democratic and  optimistic spirit.    ""This tale has unquestionable power and influence but bears little resemblance  to the events of the Western past,"" Limerick countered nearly 100 years later.  ""The myth has the undeniable charm of simplicity. Simplicity, alas, is the one  quality that cannot be found in the actual story of the American West.""    Turner-bashing is hardly a new exercise. His theories were repudiated as early  as the 1930s, as the country entered a more pessimistic and cynical period.  However, they enjoyed a period of revival a generation later, when such  historians as Ray Allen Billington of Northwestern University began searching  for a definition of the American character. ""Idealism drove the pioneers onward  no less than the hope of material gain,"" Billington wrote in 1963. ""They were  dreamers who found in westering a road to the foot of the rainbow.""    Today, no historian accepts Turner uncritically. Some say that Limerick is  attacking a straw man when her real quarrel is more with the mythology of the  West than with the way the subject is taught. Limerick argues that most  American historians mistakenly view the West through the overly nationalistic  and celebratory frontier prism, without adequate attention to how diverse  peoples converged in the region -- women, as well as men, Indians, Europeans,  Latin Americans, Asians and blacks.    ""Legacy"" does not even mention the Lewis and Clark expedition, Custer's battle  at the Little Big Horn or the Gunfight at O.K. Corral. It is a plea to see the  West in complex, unsentimental terms: To remember that many settlers simply  could not make it and returned home; that horrible accidents occurred in the  mines while the legal system offered the miners no protection; that federal  policies helped create a pattern of boom-bust cycles.    Where Indians once were treated as barriers to the settlers' progress, new  historians urge a closer look at how European intruders must have appeared to  the Indians. Borrowing from environmental historians, they find links between  massive cattle deaths in the 1880s caused by overgrazing and current  allegations that the federal government is similarly ruining the range by  keeping grazing fees artificially low.    Limerick said about 200 Western historians, including many who would prefer to  be grouped under the heading of Chicano, Asian or Native American studies and  some who are still in graduate school, are sympathetic to the revisionist  perspective.    On the other side are historians who say it is wrong, even dangerous, to view  the past by the standards of today. Nineteenth-Century settlers cleared oak  forests to make way for farmland, with lasting repercussions for the  environment. To hold ""farmers who have no familiarity and experience in this .  . . accountable in some way isn't right,"" said Martin Ridge, professor emeritus  at the University of Indiana.    ""I am an environmentalist in the 20th-Century sense but I cannot turn the clock  back,"" said Ridge, who has been attacked by Limerick as a symbol of Turnerism.    Critics say the political slant of the new history can also lead to  oversimplification and overemphasis on the darker aspects. ""I think I come down  somewhere in the middle,"" said Glenda Riley, a women's historian at Marquette  University in Milwaukee. ""Like with women -- there was a lot of wife abuse,  there was rape, the divorce rate was pretty high. . . . But on the other hand,  there were a lot of jobs available . . . and (women's) suffrage was here (in  the West) first.""    Not surprisingly, Limerick's self-characterization as pioneer has caused a good  measure of resentment. ""Sometimes, (revisionists) don't acknowledge some of the  ancestors of the newer spirit, and it hurts our feelings a little bit,"" said  Wilbur Jacobs, professor emeritus at UC Santa Barbara, who is considered a  forerunner in the field of environmental history.    To the charge that her work is not new -- that it reflects much of the social  history that has been popular in American history for the past three decades --  Limerick responds: ""There have always been those pieces and parts. But putting  it into one new vision and calling that 'conquest' -- that is new.""    ""What Patty wants to do is be the Frederick Jackson Turner of her time,"" said  Hutton of the University of New Mexico -- an assessment that Limerick dismisses  as ""perfect idiocy,"" saying, ""I want there to be a lot of Turners.""    If that happens, they might well include the following scholars -- all but one  did graduate work at Yale -- whose names crop up in nearly every discussion of  new historians:    * Richard White: A year from now, ""Legacy"" is likely to be supplanted by  White's thick textbook called ""It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own,"" in an  ironic reference to a cowboy song. Six years in the making, it will offer the  first chronological narrative from the revisionist perspective.    White, 43, a soft-spoken man whose gray hair reaches to his shoulders, is  interested in how the heroic legends developed and were incorporated into  people's behavior. He said he will also demonstrate how ""the West instead of  being a region that's the most individualistic is the region that is most  dependent on the federal government.""    * Donald Worster: Born in Needles, Calif., the Jeremiah of the foursome offers  an uncompromisingly anti-capitalist view of a region he defines by its dryness.  His latest book, ""Rivers of Empire,"" traces the effects of massive irrigation  systems in creating a ""hydraulic society"" that is ""increasingly a coercive,  monolithic . . . system, ruled by a power elite based on the ownership of  capital and expertise.""    In contrast to the South, said Worster, 49, the West has never been subjected  to an internal moral critique. ""The old Western myth was that these people were  the salt of the Earth, that they were people of astounding virtue,"" he said.  ""But these same people often were filled with greed and violence and corruption  and racism. . . . No people went through an environment faster, and more  destructively and more wastefully than Americans have gone through North  America.""    * William Cronon: A protege of Howard R. Lamar at Yale, also Limerick's mentor,  Cronon has a close relationship with other new historians but has distanced  himself from some of their arguments. Although very much of an environmental  historian, he is more moderate than the others and more inclined to see the  development of the West as ""an ambiguous legacy.""    Cronon, 36, a Rhodes scholar and MacArthur fellow, considers himself a frontier  historian rather than a regionalist, having chosen the field because it  encompassed his -- and Turner's -- home state of Wisconsin. ""Because Wisconsin  is east of the Mississippi, I'm nervous about any definition that excludes it,""  he said.    His new book, ""Nature's Metropolis,"" will show how environmental changes in the  West, such as the destruction of millions of bison, were linked to the rise of  Chicago in the latter part of the 19th Century. This ""urban-rural linkage"" has  previously been overlooked, he said.    Whether new or not, many of the revisionist concepts have already seeped into  the mainstream. Despite a predilection for guns and Western movies, the  2-year-old Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles attempts to strip  the frontier story of some of its romanticism.    Given additional resources, chief curator James H. Nottage said, ""I would be  doing more and more to make clear what the different ethnic and cultural voices  were in the whole settlement and development of what we call the West.""

""What Patty wants to do is be the Frederick Jackson Turner of her time,"" said  Hutton of the University of New Mexico -- an assessment that Limerick dismisses  as ""perfect idiocy,"" saying, ""I want there to be a lot of Turners.""    If that happens, they might well include the following scholars -- all but one  did graduate work at Yale -- whose names crop up in nearly every discussion of  new historians:    * Richard White: A year from now, ""Legacy"" is likely to be supplanted by  White's thick textbook called ""It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own,"" in an  ironic reference to a cowboy song. Six years in the making, it will offer the  first chronological narrative from the revisionist perspective.    White, 43, a soft-spoken man whose gray hair reaches to his shoulders, is  interested in how the heroic legends developed and were incorporated into  people's behavior. He said he will also demonstrate how ""the West instead of  being a region that's the most individualistic is the region that is most  dependent on the federal government.""    * Donald Worster: Born in Needles, Calif., the Jeremiah of the foursome offers  an uncompromisingly anti-capitalist view of a region he defines by its dryness.  His latest book, ""Rivers of Empire,"" traces the effects of massive irrigation  systems in creating a ""hydraulic society"" that is ""increasingly a coercive,  monolithic . . . system, ruled by a power elite based on the ownership of  capital and expertise.""    In contrast to the South, said Worster, 49, the West has never been subjected  to an internal moral critique. ""The old Western myth was that these people were  the salt of the Earth, that they were people of astounding virtue,"" he said.  ""But these same people often were filled with greed and violence and corruption  and racism. . . . No people went through an environment faster, and more  destructively and more wastefully than Americans have gone through North  America.""    * William Cronon: A protege of Howard R. Lamar at Yale, also Limerick's mentor,  Cronon has a close relationship with other new historians but has distanced  himself from some of their arguments. Although very much of an environmental  historian, he is more moderate than the others and more inclined to see the  development of the West as ""an ambiguous legacy.""    Cronon, 36, a Rhodes scholar and MacArthur fellow, considers himself a frontier  historian rather than a regionalist, having chosen the field because it  encompassed his -- and Turner's -- home state of Wisconsin. ""Because Wisconsin  is east of the Mississippi, I'm nervous about any definition that excludes it,""  he said.    His new book, ""Nature's Metropolis,"" will show how environmental changes in the  West, such as the destruction of millions of bison, were linked to the rise of  Chicago in the latter part of the 19th Century. This ""urban-rural linkage"" has  previously been overlooked, he said.    Whether new or not, many of the revisionist concepts have already seeped into  the mainstream. Despite a predilection for guns and Western movies, the  2-year-old Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles attempts to strip  the frontier story of some of its romanticism.    Given additional resources, chief curator James H. Nottage said, ""I would be  doing more and more to make clear what the different ethnic and cultural voices  were in the whole settlement and development of what we call the West.""

Assembly Chairman Mustafa  Dzhemilev, his deputy Rifat Chubarov, and other Assembly members  said in their addresses that in the series of acts of violence  that is gaining momentum in Crimea, the assassination of  Iskandar Mamedov is not the first act directed against the  Crimean Tatars. All these events, says the Assembly statement  made in connection with the escalation of violence in Crimea,  attest to the efforts by certain political forces to destabilize  the situation by inveigling Crimean Tatars into a wide-scale  conflict. The Assembly of the Crimean Tatar people, which  rejects violence in solving any questions, believes: ""In the  situation that has taken shape, measures should be immediately  taken to resolutely cut short actions that threaten peace and  the fragile calm in Crimea."" It is necessary, in the Assembly's  opinion, to stop crime in Crimea, which has appreciably grown  owing to the worsened political situation in the course of the  elections for Crimea's president and the preparations for the  elections for a new Supreme Soviet.    The Assembly finds it necessary to take measures to preserve  peace and accord on the peninsula. The statement says that a  special investigation group should be created on a  first-priority basis in Ukraine's prosecutor's office to carry  out a thorough and objective investigation into all acts of  violence and terror in Crimea. The Assembly demands that the  Supreme Soviets of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea should  ""examine and bring into line the provisions of the Republic of  Crimea's constitution with the existing legislation of Ukraine  and with the requirements of the trilateral agreement between  the United States, Russia, and Ukraine on nuclear disarmament  and mutual security guarantees.""

However, when your valiant  Armed Forces, the soldiers of the homeland and the revolution,  and the protectors of unity and legitimacy, began to confront  them, they were the first to escape and the first to be defeated  on the fields of honor and in the arenas of legitimate and  sacred defense of the homeland's achievements and the crown of  unity, which is shining over the homeland's heads in pride and  glory.    Yes, the cowards of the party and shedders of blood, the  followers of 'Ali Salim al-Bid and murderer Haytham Qasim Tahir,  have fled. They are addicted to the smell of gunpowder and the  sound of gunfire, and are used to fleeing and retreating in  front of the good forces, the protectors of our homeland, and  its valiant heroes in the heroic Armed Forces and in its  brigades, which are deployed all over the beloved homeland to  protect the most precious achievements of the homeland and to  give to the constitutional legitimacy and the Yemeni masses'  options the right to survival, steadfastness, and existence.    Since the evil gang in the YSP and the clique of apostasy  and  partition is entirely wrong, the sons of our Armed Forces have  not relented and will never relent to confront this gang's evil  schemes. Here are the troops of our one army, which this gang  sought to throw into a losing battle against the legitimacy, are  joining the ranks of this legitimacy one group after another in  order to join the ranks of right and the trenches of the sacred  duty of defending the achievements of the people against the  plans that are backed by filthy money to sabotage and destroy  the homeland.

If God helps you, none can overcome you.  [Koranic verse] With God's support and with the courage of the  heroes of the valiant Armed Forces, their heroic capabilities,  and high combat skills, the forces protecting Yemeni unity and  championing constitutional legitimacy completely destroyed all  fortifications in the al-'Anad military base yesterday evening.  This morning, these forces were able to fully control the base  after the expiry of the time given to the personnel who were  misled by the secessionist and rebellious gang in the [Yemeni]  Socialist Party [YSP] to allow them to join the forces of  legitimacy. At dawn today, Tuesday, our valiant Armed Forces  ended the military legend that used to surround the al-'Anad  base, its fortifications, and the various weaponry it had stored  in its base and secret cellars. A large part of it was turned  into rubble. Scattered concrete piles, destroyed weapons and  vehicles, and remnants of ash tell the story of the crazy  arrogance of the gang of rebellion, apostasy, and secession in  the YSP. With this military arsenal and other military  ammunition, this gang thought it could be above the people's  will and be greater than their constitutional institutions.    But God Almighty, the people, and the Armed Forces were  lying  in wait for all of this. Thus, their plans were foiled and the  rebels received their punishment.    In addition, our Armed Forces managed to seize what was left  of the variety of military hardware. Units of our brave Armed  Forces are now finishing their missions, after the Yemeni  homeland has irrevocably passed the danger of the threat posed  by the rebellious secessionists to unity and democracy.    Praise be to God who has supported the fighters with his  victory. God is the best to protect and the best to help.  [Koranic verse]    Issued by the Defense Ministry, Sanaa     "

Referring to the previous attack on the French Embassy and  the Air France office in Tehran on November 9, the paper said,  ""undoubtedly the two instances of attacks on the foreign  embassies in Tehran, involving in both cases European countries,  are related to one another and are in fact links in a chain of  premediated plots which are carried out with specific  objectives.""    It stressed that such acts of terrorism are meant ""to damage  the international prestige of the Islamic Republic.""    ""In the past few months the Islamic Republic had undertaken  active diplomatic initiatives to resolve its problems with some  of the European countries and it had attained great progress in  this direction.    ""In the majority of cases the diplomatic initiatives taken  by  the Islamic Republic have been successful, and a broad range of  understandings had been achieved. The most concrete sign of the  improvement of relations between Iran and the Western Europe is  the release of the two Iranian citizens by the French  Government,"" said the article.    It further added, ""consequently it is quite logical to  conclude that the attacks on the embassies are meant to  undermine Iran's recent improved relations with the Western  European countries.    ""Terrorist acts including attacks on embassies have always  been condemned by the Islamic Republic as irrational endeavors  which defeat their own purpose.""    The editorial in conclusion called for taking concrete  measures to forestall any attempt which aims to sabotage Iran's  diplomatic achievements and for tightening security measures  around embassy compounds.

A statement addressing these soldiers was distributed in  Nabulus, Tulkarm, Hebron, and other cities. The statement says:  Your history, dignity, Arabism, and Arab magnanimity require  you to rebel. This call is a sincere invitation to rescue  yourself from the quagmire of crime against our kinsfolk and  clan.    The statement adds: Our call is genuine and does not stem  from emotions. Throughout the years, we have persevered and we  have suppressed our pain and sorrow as we saw part of our own  people practice killing and terrorism against our people  everywhere in southern Lebanon and Palestine.    The statement says: It is now time for you to return to your  genuine Arab dignity and magnanimity that was upheld by the  great struggler Sultan Pasha al-Atrash followed by the great  struggler Kamal Junblat. Let those heroes be your paragon of  honor and dignity.    The statement says colonialist invaders are evicted and  defeated and oppressed people triumph. History tells us about  the invaders and colonialists. Remember your ancestors at Jabal  al-'Arab who, led by struggler Sultan Pasha al-'Atrash, defeated  and evicted the French, just as they were evicted from Algeria  and just as the United States left Vietnam in defeat.    Fatah Hawks also sent a warning to settlers in the occupied  Palestinian territories that says: As of 28 February, you are  being pursued wherever you are. Our fighters will pursue you  and the occupation army and other security bodies will not  protect you.    The warning says: It is time for retribution. Your only  chance is to immediately leave the settlements before it is too  late. The warning adds: If you leave, you will survive. Leave  the settlement immediately.

These are excerpts of a statement containing the  reaction of the HDZ deputies to a letter sent by Josip Manolic  and Stipe Mesic, the presidents of the Assembly's chambers of  counties and deputies, to the U.S. Congress on 4 May this year.    The HDZ deputies say that this is an unprecedented act in  Croatian political history and they therefore unanimously  condemn such an unheard-of act. Abusing and usurping their  official posts of president of the Croatian Assembly and  president of the Chamber of Counties, Stipe Mesic and Josip  Manolic, without any consent of the assembly, of their own  accord sent the above-mentioned letter to members of the U.S.  Congress, monstrously slandering their own state institutions in  which they were duty-bound to protect the Constitution and laws.    In their condemnation, they go so far as to equate the  heroic  struggle of defense and liberation by the Croatian people for  freedom and independence with the imperialistic, fascist,  chetnik, aggressive regime of the greater Serbia of Slobodan  Milosevic. By this they even want to suggest that the top  Croatian officials should be charged with instigating the  aggression.    Despite huge efforts and the successes of the Croatian  president and the Croatian Government and assembly in the  implementation of the Washington agreement, the creation of the  federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the historic agreement  between the Croats and the Muslims, Manolic and Mesic  fraudulently and completely unfoundedly condemn the entire  Croatian authorities and state policy of undermining the  Washington agreement, and call on the United States to overturn  the legitimate Croatian Government and replace it with another  government, which would not be an expression of the political  will of the Croatian Assembly.    The HDZ deputies in the assembly's Chambers of Deputies and  Counties most vehemently condemn the defamation, lies,  intrigues, and insinuations by Manolic and Mesic, which may have  far-reaching and destructive consequences for the survival of  the Croatian state and the freedom of the Croatian people.

0,FT944-12930 ,"FT944-12930 _AN-EJ3AVAEZFT 941029   FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Putting a fresh twist on Beethoven - A controversial conductor who likes his players to take risks      By ANDREW CLARK   An unusual musical partnership takes to the stage in London and Birmingham over the next two weeks: Nikolaus Harnoncourt will conduct the Philharmonia Orchestra in two cycles of the Beethoven symphonies. Harnoncourt is the pope of historically-aware performing practice in continental Europe. The Philharmonia represents the modern symphony orchestra par excellence. Harnoncourt has been hailed as one of the most original and dynamic interpreters of classical repertoire, celebrated for his ability to make people hear familiar music with fresh ears. Well-known to record-buying cognoscenti in the UK, he has been a rare visitor to London. The Philharmonia concerts are his first encounter with a British orchestra - one which helped shape a previous generation's knowledge of Beethoven through its concerts and recordings with Otto Klemperer. Just how easily the Philharmonia will absorb Harnoncourt's ideas is the subject of much speculation in London's music establishment. Whatever happens, the results are unlikely to be dull. Harnoncourt's Beethoven is worlds away from the traditional approach. He favours shorter, more eventful phrasing, rationed vibrato, sharply-defined timpani and horns that rasp like their valveless antecedents. He is equally far from the opposite pole of 'authentic' gurus. He has never conducted Beethoven with a period-instrument ensemble, his dictum being that the player is more important than the instrument. He drives Beethoven's allegros with blinding intensity, but unlike Roger Norrington or John Eliot Gardiner, he introduces subtle inflexions of tempo. The result is a marriage between historical nicety and the need to project and re-invent the music for today. Harnoncourt, a Berlin-born Austrian, made his name as a specialist in baroque and early music, but now spends most of his time with conventional orchestras. Those who have worked with him speak of his instinctive feeling for the music, backed by extensive study of contemporary sources. Francis Hunter, who played oboe in Harnoncourt's Mozart cycle at the Zurich Opera House, refers to 'his ability to slot into the gut level of each piece and convey what is meaningful and expressive'. Harnoncourt spent 17 years as a cellist in the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, so he knows what it is like to sit listening to conductors. 'He has answers to why he wants things done in a certain way,' says Dane Roberts, a double-bass player in the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, with whom Harnoncourt has recorded the Beethoven symphonies. Harnoncourt, 64, is less forbidding in conversation than his platform manner would suggest. He speaks good English and is accompanied everywhere by his wife, Alice, an experienced violinist who acts as his agent. His biggest triumphs in recent years have been at the Salzburg Festival: cold-shouldered during the Karajan years, he has become a fixture of Gerard Mortier's programme, and will conduct Le nozze di Figaro next summer. His present repertoire ranges from Purcell's Fairy Queen to Bruckner's Third Symphony. He acknowledges numerous blind spots, including Gluck, Berlioz, Mahler and Strauss, but has late Verdi and Berg's Violin Concerto in his sights. Central to Harnoncourt's understanding of Beethoven is what he calls the musical rhetoric - word-like units of phrase which grew out of the connections between music and language in the baroque and early classical era. 'Composers a generation after Beethoven would laugh at the idea,' he says. 'Beethoven drew on the same musical vocabulary for 30 years of his life - words, figures, formed from a handful of notes - and used them in a rhetorical way. Is the musical speech a continuation of the previous phrase or a response to it? It's important that the players know, because his music tells you something - it's on the verge of programme music.' Harnoncourt dismisses the idea of musical authenticity. He says that even when orchestras play with period instruments, they are realising their idea of sound from a 20th-century perspective. 'Musical interpretation changes with every generation. Each laughs at its predecessor and believes it is closer to the will of the composer. I do all the repeats in Beethoven's symphonies, but 30 years ago it was not the done thing, and in another 30 it will be different again. It is like changing fashion.' One reason why the field of interpretation is so wide is that Beethoven did not always make his final intentions clear. Harnoncourt says the autograph scores are different to most composers of the period, 'because Beethoven did not correct them - he gave them to a copyist and corrected the copy. The parts were printed before the full score, so he corrected the parts. You cannot even say the last source is the will of Beethoven, because he changed a work like the Fourth Symphony for certain performances. You have to make a lot of judgments yourself.' At the same time, Harnoncourt is determined to root out modern accretions, such as the trumpet's 'note of victory' in the first movement of the Eroica. 'Orchestras today play a note which was not written by Beethoven. You could say the theme is not complete without it, that the trumpet players of Beethoven's time were not good enough, so let's add it. I think Beethoven included the failure, just as he asks the sopranos in the Missa Solemnis to sing a note that's too high for them. He wanted their faces to be blue and the voice to crack - this is part of the composition. A hero likes to show only his heroic side, but what Beethoven does is to show that after all, the hero is a failure.' He dismisses the argument that if Beethoven had had access to today's instruments, he would have adapted the parts accordingly. 'Then he would have written everything differently. The limitations of the instruments were a source of inspiration. We don't know what Beethoven would have done with the instruments of today - geniuses always do things differently to what we expect. I don't agree with the retouching that goes on. I don't change a note.' Harnoncourt also questions modern trends in orchestral sound, saying the American-led drive for technical perfection puts the emphasis on security at the expense of beauty. That is why he encourages brass players to experiment with the old valveless instruments. He describes beauty as 'something to do with unevenness - it's changing all the time, there is a bit of dirt in it, it's not pure. If you have a group of semi-quavers and you play them absolutely equal, it's sterile. 'For me, the most beautiful instrument lies at the edge of catastrophe. I prefer risk - I like a musician who makes a mistake because he risks too much.' The Harnoncourt/Philharmonia Beethoven cycle begins at London's Royal Festival Hall tonight and Birmingham's Symphony Hall next Thursday.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In an educational seminar held for its students, by the  Higher Institute for Political Science, Salman spoke on the firm  principles of the Syrian policy under President Hafiz al-Asad's  historic leadership in terms of domestic construction and  political and economic multiplicity, and in terms of the Arab  solidarity and strengthening the Arab people against the  cultural invasion to which they are being exposed.    Salman spoke about the peace process and its repercussions  and on obstacles that are preventing its progress. He said:  Syria supported the peace initiative because it emphasized the  implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.  Syria's insistence on a comprehensive solution stems from its  firm pan-Arab principles. This was manifested at the Geneva  summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Bill  Clinton where Al-Asad represented the Arabs' stand and desires  and the U.S. Administration announced its intention to realize  comprehensive peace on all tracks of the conflict.    The minister refuted the motives of the tendentious  campaigns  of Israel, the Zionist Lobby, and the media that are sympathetic  to them. He said the aim of these campaigns is to change the  firm and pan-Arab position of Syria, whose Arab and  international role has grown under President al-Asad's  leadership. This has been voiced by the Arab media which are  daily reiterating that Syria is the symbol of the pan-Arab  struggle and the honest helmsman of the Arab ship sailing toward  the future.    At the end of the meeting, Salman answered questions by  students participating in the seminar.    Answering a question, Salman said: I hope Rabin's  announcement on withdrawal from the Golan will be free of land  mines which we have always encountered in every session of talks  in which the principle of withdrawal from all the occupied  territories in exchange for peace was discussed.

My caddy had proudly claimed that the course was the best in Africa. When I suggested that there were some in South Africa that might rival it, he lashed out at me. Or so it seemed. I saw a strange creature writhing on the ground. My caddy had reacted instinctively to a wild animal which had fallen from a tree and wrapped itself around my neck. 'You were lucky,' said the caddie. 'This very bad animal. If it had stung you it would have been bad for you.' Puzzled, and slightly alarmed, I finished the round and gave my protector an extra tip for his heroic action. When I tried to discover the creature's identity, I was met with laughter by Charles, the club pro. 'That,' he said, 'was a harmless chameleon.' For some reason, Africans are scared of chameleons. Unlike the nearby course at Muthaiga, whose fairways have been attracting golfers since the 1930s, Windsor is almost brand new, although you would not guess it from your first glance at the course, which threads its way through coffee farms and forest. On a clear day you can see the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kenya. The main hotel / club building seems to have been constructed with a built-in turn-of-the-century patina. The designers have made use of existing trees rather than planting new ones. And, this being Africa, colourfully-clad women can be seen every morning weeding out long grass from the edge of the fairways. British Airways Holidays' golf brochure features a seven-night trip that includes five nights' accommodation and breakfast at the Windsor Golf and Country Club, plus a free round of golf per day, plus two nights' full board at the Kichwa Tembo tented camp in the Masai Mara with three game drives per day.

The meeting was between Army officers in the Rwanda  Government and Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] officers. UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] was there and observers  and mediators. On the side of UNAMIR, present were Dr.  Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, Major General Dollaire, and Colonel  Caner. In the RPF part, there was Lieutenant Col. Kayonga and  Maj. Rwigamba. The Rwandan Government was represented by five  Army officers, including Col. Gapfizi, Lt. Col. Rwabalinda and  Maj. Gakara. Before any negotiations for a cease-fire can take  place, RPF gave the following conditions to the Rwandan  Government soldiers:    1. To stop the widespread killings. This should be enforced  in the following manner:    a) restore telephone communications in the National  Development Council [CND] building and also restore telephone  services for internal and external uses;    b) the two sides must check on whether the killings have  stopped and assess what has been spoiled or damaged;    c) it should be made easy and possible for the journalists  to enter and visit CND;    d) release and announce a list of all politicians killed  in the violence; and    e) allow or permit people, organizations who want to help.    2. To denounce and condemn the Presidential Guards for what  they have done. This should be done in the following manner:    a) remind them that they are soldiers and have to behave  accordingly;    b) disarm them and keep them in a camp where they are  under strict control of RPA and the government Army pending  court trials;    c) abolish the Presidential Guard;    d) hunt all those members of the Presidential Guard who  have escaped wherever they may be in and out of the country;    e) denounce the violent acts of Presidential Guards on  Radio Rwanda four times a day and in both French and Kinyarwanda  languages. The nature and form of the announcement will be  agreed upon by the two sides before it goes to radio.    3. To denounce and imprison all the groups that have taken  part in the acts of violence like murdering, raping, looting and  destroying property. This should be done in the following manner:    a) denounce and punish the leadership of the national  Gendarmerie for not taking any action to stop the violence; this  should be announced on Radio Rwanda four times a day and in  French and Kinyarwanda languages;    b) try in the court of law and imprison those who are  found guilty;    c) announce on Radio Rwanda four times a day and in French  and Kinyarwanda to ask civilians to surrender arms and  ammunition in their possession;    d) stop immediately from work the leaders who are  suspected of collaborating with the killer groups;    e) arrest and imprison politicians and journalists who  have taken part in encouraging violence; and    f) stop Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines) [RTLM]  completely and use only Radio Rwanda to broadcast selected  programs and to restore radio and television workers, only those  who are known for clean political lines.    4. Denounce the self-imposed government and its president.  This should be done in the following manner:    a) use radio statements to denounce the government four  times a day in French and Kinyarwanda languages;    b) the so-called government should return and handover  government property or documents in their possession;    c) examine what that government has done with a view to  the misuse of funds or property;    d) any member of this government who might have taken part  in or encouraged acts of violence should be tried and brought to  justice.    All the above must be observed and fulfilled before any  cease-fire talks can begin.     "

The good news? The management had managed to engage Yuri Simonov, one of the  finest conductors in the Soviet Union, to make his U.S. orchestral debut  replacing Andre Previn on the podium.    The bad news? Simonov had to make do with a strange repertory grab-bag selected  by and for our hastily departed music director.    The first half of the program posed no special problems. Resplendent in the  Old-World formality of black tails rather than the usual New-World casualness  of a white dinner-jacket, Simonov opened the festivities with the most dramatic  reading of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" in memory. Lending new meaning to the  concept of perestroika, our Soviet guest whipped through our national anthem as  if lives were at stake.    Next he dispatched Tchaikovsky's ""Marche Slave"" with passion that verged on  frenzy. He all but dared the Los Angeles Philharmonic not to follow his  precisely manicured urgings.    Then he provided a fast and fluent, decidedly unsentimental though subtly  nuanced orchestral frame for Rachmaninoff's First Piano Concerto. He may have  unnerved Jeffrey Kahane in the process, for the talented young soloist gave a  performance more notable for introspection than for accuracy or fluency. Still,  this was Simonov on musical terra firma.    The terra proved far less firma after intermission.

The good news? The management had managed to engage Yuri Simonov, one of the  finest conductors in the Soviet Union, to make his U.S. orchestral debut  replacing Andre Previn on the podium.    The bad news? Simonov had to make do with a strange repertory grab-bag selected  by and for our hastily departed music director.    The first half of the program posed no special problems. Resplendent in the  Old-World formality of black tails rather than the usual New-World casualness  of a white dinner-jacket, Simonov opened the festivities with the most dramatic  reading of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" in memory. Lending new meaning to the  concept of perestroika, our Soviet guest whipped through our national anthem as  if lives were at stake.    Next he dispatched Tchaikovsky's ""Marche Slave"" with passion that verged on  frenzy. He all but dared the Los Angeles Philharmonic not to follow his  precisely manicured urgings.    Then he provided a fast and fluent, decidedly unsentimental though subtly  nuanced orchestral frame for Rachmaninoff's First Piano Concerto. He may have  unnerved Jeffrey Kahane in the process, for the talented young soloist gave a  performance more notable for introspection than for accuracy or fluency. Still,  this was Simonov on musical terra firma.    The terra proved far less firma after intermission. Simonov tried desperately,  touchingly, to validate the all-American charms and rigors of ""Appalachian  Spring."" Unfortunately, the gift to be simple with Copland eluded him.    Finally, in the supreme vulgarity of Ravel's ""La Valse,"" Simonov mistook  soulful brio for Gallic glitter.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang today issued a  statement on this.    The statement says: As is known to all, China has  indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their  adjacent waters, and the Wan An Reef is part of the Nansha  Islands. In recent years, Vietnam has demarcated certain blocks  in this area for external bidding and has on many occasions  harassed the normal scientific survey and fishing activities of  Chinese vessels. Now it has moved into this area for oil and  gas prospecting and development. It must be pointed out that  these moves have seriously violated China's sovereignty over the  Nansha Islands and have also put the Wab-21 petroleum contract  signed between the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and  the Crestone Energy Corporation of the United States, which  covers this area, in serious jeopardy. The Chinese side has  made solemn representations on many occasions to the Vietnamese  side over its acts of violating China's sovereignty in the  Nanshas. The Chinese Government demands once again that the  Vietnamese Government, in proceeding from the overall interests  of maintaining and developing bilateral relations and preserving  peace and stability in the region, stop the aforementioned acts  of infringement upon China's sovereignty.    Shen Guofang also announced: Vice President Joseph Estrada  of the Republic of the Philippines will pay an official visit to  China from 18 to 25 June at the invitation of Chinese Vice  President Rong Yiren. A delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the  Republic of Tajikistan will pay an official goodwill visit to  China from 21 to 28 June, as guests of China's National People's  Congress Standing Committee.    Shen Guofang also answered questions raised by reporters on  the Korean nuclear issue, Sino-British relations, and the Hong  Kong issue.     "

Completing their first bilateral talks with a comprehensive plan for concerted  action, the group of 10 Soviets and 10 Americans also recommended a prohibition  on the sale or transfer of military explosives and certain classes of weapons  to non-governmental organizations as well as restrictions or tighter control on  sales to other nations.    Curbing such sales has long been of concern to the United States because many  of the weapons used by terrorist groups come from East Bloc countries.    The Soviet and American specialists also called for joint efforts to prevent  terrorists from acquiring chemical, biological, nuclear and other weapons of  mass destruction and for joint exercises to improve cooperation during  terrorist incidents.    Nuclear terrorism, either in acquisition of nuclear capabilities or attacking  nuclear facilities, has long been an important issue for the Soviets, while the  United States has been concerned about the proliferation of chemical and  biological weapons capabilities by Third World countries, notably Libya.    The group suggested the ""exchange of technology that may be useful in  preventing or combatting terrorism . . . consistent with the national security  interests as defined by each nation.""    The proposals, in a nine-point statement climaxing a five-day conference here,  are the most far-reaching ever advanced on Soviet-American cooperation to  combat terrorism. They particularly reflect the growing concern in Moscow about  the international threats -- and thus the greater interest in joint efforts.    Although the conference was organized by private Soviet citizens, current and  former government officials spoke at the session. And the conference in general  was officially sanctioned ""at the highest levels,"" according to Soviet  organizers.    Before it was held, both the U.S. and Soviet governments privately expressed  interest in its outcome as an indication of the potential for official talks.    Although both sides deliberated at length over the wording of the statement,  the Soviets allowed the Americans to take the lead on every issue -- a further  indication of the Soviet Union's new interest in cooperation.

""A very important basis of cooperation has been set. We now see a possibility  of how the U.S. and the Soviet Union could work together. The framework is now  established as are the specifics. It's now up to the two governments to move.""    In a broad statement, the Soviet-American group said, ""In their bilateral  relations as well as their respective relations with all other states, the U.S.  and the Soviet Union should recognize their strong mutual interest in  preventing acts of violence, especially acts of terrorism, which could have  catalytic regional consequences, and thereby lead to their involvement in local  conflicts against their interests.    ""Therefore, the U.S. and the Soviet Union should move together to prevent  terrorism and control its consequences when it occurs. The issue of  international terrorism -- its causes, manifestations and consequences --  should be high on their bilateral agenda.""    The wording was aimed particularly at stressing the importance of preventing  terrorist incidents that might in turn derail superpower relations.      Ties to Client States    Both the United States and the Soviet Union have strong relations with client  states, particularly in the Middle East, that the other side has accused of  terrorist activity. Both sides expressed the greatest interest in establishing  a formal link at the level of operations and crisis management, to prevent  terrorism and resolve or investigate attacks.    The group also proposed bilateral talks on requiring chemical or other ""tags""  on commercial and military explosives to aid investigators of terrorist  bombings.    That issue is particularly sensitive to the United States, which has been the  target of a series of bombings over the past six years, including the explosion  aboard Pan Am's Flight 103 over Scotland last month. U.S. investigators have  still not fully resolved several of the earlier incidents.    On legal issues, the two delegations recommended ""drafting an international  convention that would cover threats and acts of violence that deliberately  target the civilian population and that have an international dimension.""    They also proposed consideration of the feasibility of an international  tribunal, either ad-hoc or permanent, to try individuals responsible for  international terrorism. In addition, they called on the United Nations to  establish a standing committee on international terrorism.    Although the two sides acknowledged that there were inherent limitations to  cooperation, often related to the status of superpower relations, the general  tenor of the meeting was considered by both sides to be a big step forward on  one of the most controversial and sensitive issues dividing the two nations.

The Presidential and Executive Councils of the united Iraqi  National Congress, INC, held their sixth joint meeting in the  INC headquarters in the city of Salah-al-Din from 1-6 February  1994.    The meeting was inaugurated by a Koranic recitation. The  chairman of the Executive Council then read a report on the  INC's activities during 1993 and the agenda of the meeting was  approved. The agenda includes a review of recent developments  inside Iraq and on the regional and international levels with  regard to the Iraqi issue. The conferees studied the report  presented by the chairman of the Executive Council.    In light of this, the following committees were formed to  discuss matters in detail:    The Arab and Islamic Relations Committee; the International  Affairs Committee; the Financial Committee; the Administration  and Organizational Committee; and the 1994 Plan Committee.    The Arab and Islamic Relations Committee discussed ways to  promote the INC's relations with the neighborly states, the Arab  states, and the Islamic world to serve the cause of the Iraqi  people and to confront dictatorship in Iraq. The committee made  many recommendations in this regard.    The International Affairs Committee dealt with developments  in the issue in terms of international organizations and foreign  countries. The committee recommended that the INC exert efforts  to ensure the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions  706 and 712, which call for providing food and medicine to the  Iraqi people to alleviate their suffering provided that the  dictatorial regime is deprived of the flow of funds.    The conferees studied the new international efforts to  implement the UN resolutions, particularly UN Security Council  Resolution 688, which call for ending repression and coercion  against the Iraqi people. The conferees underscored the need to  protect human rights and called for an expansion of the no-fly  zone to cover the whole of Iraq and establish a safehaven in the  south. They also noted that the international community is  becoming firmer vis-a-vis the dictatorial regime of Saddam  Husayn and is supporting trends to set up a national democratic  alternative in Iraq that respects the will of the Arab and  Kurdish people to choose the form of their future government in  Iraq.    The Financial, Administrative, and Organizational Committees  studied financial, administrative, and organizational affairs.  The committees' reports tackled financial, administrative, and  organizational matters. The conferees discussed these issues  and made the appropriate decisions.    The conferees also made the necessary decisions and took  measures to activate the constitutional consultative council.    The committee charged with charting the 1994 plan stressed  the need to continue the conference's program and working plans  to confront the dictatorial regime and establish a democratic  alternative.    The plan touches on the principal issues in the struggle  against dictatorship, especially the political aspect. It is  aimed at implementing the conference's political statement by:  emphasizing the democratic, national alternative that we seek  to achieve; by entrenching the democratic experience in  Kurdistan; by showing concern for the unity of Iraq, which is  being threatened by the course followed by the dictatorial  regime and by the regime's continuation; by emphasizing the  importance of strengthening Arab-Kurdish brotherhood and  guaranteeing administrative and cultural national rights to the  Turkomans and Assyrians; and by seeking to create a democratic,  pluralistic, federal Iraq that strengthens the country's unity.    The plan also emphasizes the need to employ regional and  international sympathy for our people to help enact the  international resolutions and serve the struggle against  dictatorship. The plan also emphasizes our reliance on our  people's administration to establish an alternative of their  choice.    The plan is also aimed at strengthening the conference's  initiatives on the Arab, Islamic, and international levels to  win greater attention from the world in support of the Iraqi  cause.    On the subject of human rights, we stress the need to draft  a  comprehensive plan to activate and implement UN Security Council  Resolution 688. This includes the dispatch of UN observers to  monitor human rights violations in Iraq, the stationing of UN  guards in all parts of Iraq, the confrontation of all acts of  suppression practiced by the regime, and the end of the domestic  embargo imposed on liberated Kurdistan and other areas in the  south. Iraqi Kurdistan must be exempted from the international  embargo in order to alleviate the people's suffering and to help  ensure the success of democracy in the region. We must do  everything possible to stop the regime from continuing the  policy of drying up the marshlands and displacing its Arab  Shiite inhabitants. We also demand that Saddam and his gang be  brought before an international court in accordance with the  bill of indictment, which was prepared by the INC and presented  to the United Nations and other international organizations.    In the field of the media, the plan stresses the need to  adopt a policy, both inside and outside, to implement the  political directives of the conference, develop media agencies,  and provide the necessary funds and supplies for them.    The conferees also decided to consider all the papers  presented by the specialized committees, after they are  approved, as part of the 1994 plan.    The joint meeting of the two councils was briefed on certain  aspects and results of the field action. The competent agencies  in the conference have chartered the plan for the field action  for 1994.    The problems, programs, and action plan were discussed with  a sense of great responsibility. Constructive and practical  decisions and recommendations were reached in a democratic  fashion, which confirms the existence of common convictions in  all areas.    The conferees were apprised of the outcome of the meeting  held in Ankara by the foreign ministers of Syria, Iran, and  Turkey. They welcomed the ministers' statement the the internal  siege clamped on Iraqi Kurdistan and southern Iraq must be  lifted, and that electrical services must be restored to Dahuk.  They also welcomed the ministers' reiteration that Iraqi  people must be allowed to determine their future by free will.  In the same vein, the conferees would like to assert that the  continued survival of Saddam Husayn's regime poses a real threat  to the country's unity. We Iraqis, are the most concerned for  the unity of our people and homeland, the conferees noted.    The conferees underlined their eagerness and constant  efforts  to establish a democratic Iraq that would promote regional  security and stability, contribute to the establishment of good  relations with neighboring countries, and foster the economic  growth of the peoples of the region.    The conferees hailed the third anniversary of the glorious  popular uprising of March 1991, which expressed the people's  will against dictatorship and constituted a popular referendum  demanding the ousting of the regime. They glorified the martyrs  of the uprising and the anniversary of the heroic feats forged  by the uprising's heroes. They also pledged to the martyrs to  continue the struggle until the achievement of their objective  of toppling dictatorship.    While condemning the regime's repressive and criminal  practices, the joint meeting of the INC's Presidential Council  and Executive Council commends the steadfastness and sacrifices  of the glorious Iraqi people. In the same vein, they hail the  Kurdish people's resistance, as demonstrated in their efforts to  safeguard their democratic experiment, as well as the gains they  have made for the whole of Iraq. The conferees also commend our  people's steadfastness and resistance in southern and central  Iraq and the rest of Iraq. They urge military personnel and  Ba'thists to abandon the tyrant, to join the people's ranks in  struggle, and to step up this struggle on all levels in order to  topple dictatorship and set up a patriotic and democratic regime.

Mijusko Tomic reports.    [Begin recording] [Tomic] Despite the sanctions that have  been imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav  Army does not lag behind other countries and armies, while its  combat readiness is significantly higher and stronger than that  of any other neighboring country, said General Perisic. It is  founded on the best traditions of the Serbian and Montenegrin  people, and it is ready to defend the independence and  territorial integrity of our country, said Chief of General  Staff Colonel-General Momcilo Perisic, and stressed:    [Perisic] I am saying that there is no direct or immediate  danger of war. A danger of war exists because the enemy -- the  creator of the new world order -- has embarked on destroying the  state of the Serbs and Montenegrins. Once he destroys their  state, then we will behave in the manner of stateless people,  and you know what stateless peoples are like. [sentence as  heard] Better any kind of state than no state at all.  Therefore, there is a great danger of war breaking out, great  [danger], but I am saying that currently there is no immediate  [danger], precisely because of the people's heroic resistance  whom the Yugoslav People's Army [as heard] first trained, then  armed, and lastly, organized and gave them the initial impulse  to defend and succeed in defending what it has accomplished so  far. I might also add the following: militarily speaking, more  could not have been accomplished, of course, in areas where the  people embraced this army as their own. [sentence as heard]    [Tomic] Members of the Yugoslav Army are satisfied with  journalists' approach regarding the presentation of the  comprehensive combat readiness and ability of the Yugoslav Army.  It is necessary for a journalist to spread the truth about the  army, rather than lies, which is what some journalists are  doing, said Chief of General Staff Colonel-General Momcilo  Perisic.

On various axes, the units of our Armed Forces are still  receiving officers, noncommissioned officers [NCO's], and  soldiers joining the ranks of the forces of unity and protection  of constitutional legitimacy and declaring their condemnation of  the secessionist and rebellious gang which revealed its blatant  and destructive hostility to the people, the homeland, and  Yemen's present and future.    These officers, NCO's, and soldiers also stressed their  principled and courageous standing in the trench of the solid  defense of unity and of protecting both the constitutional  legitimacy and all the achievements and gains of the Republic of  Yemen.    The forces of both unity and the legitimate and  constitutional democracy continue to carry out their missions in  terms of chasing the enemies of both the people and their  unity--the despots of apostasy and secession as well as the  gangs mortgaged to their inevitable destiny.

0,FT941-12783 ,"FT941-12783 _AN-EA1CHADHFT 940128   FT  28 JAN 94 / Arts: Verdi's Messa da Requiem - Concert      By DAVID MURRAY   We had a good, sound Verdi Requiem from the Royal Philharmonic in the Festival Hall on Tuesday, much enhanced by the visiting Italians, the conductor and three members of his solo quartet: all young, and all at the outsets of their careers. So was the Puerto Rican tenor Cesar Hernandez, though he sounded hampered by something like a slight cold. His baritonal timbre was satisfyingly firm and fibrous (there is no statutory requirement for a tenore di grazia in this work), but he shaped his heroic rising phrases like someone confident of attaining a bright, ringing top - which he never quite did. It remained clouded, and often fractionally below pitch: never unpleasant, but not thrilling either. I look forward to hearing him on a healthier night. The solo bass was the 20-year-old Simone Alberghini, manifestly both well-schooled and full-voiced. No doubt it will take him some years yet to stamp the intended character upon the voice itself, beyond the vocal surface-effects; nevertheless everything he did was both tasteful and telling. The conductor Paolo Olmi, displaying the kind of deportment and stylised gestures that one associates with an older generation, took us through the score honestly, without tricks (instead of ear-shattering thwacks from the bass drum in the 'Dies irae', we got most carefully modulated punctuation) but with fine, unhesitating fluency. The Brighton Festival Chorus and London Choral Society were unanimous and sonorous, though their well-crunched consonants were better than their dull British vowels. In this work there is really no substitute for open, Italianate vowels, though the texts are in medieval Latin. It was left to the women soloists to supply the essential dramatic feeling: breathless, nervily elevated intensity from the soprano Norma Fantini, against the dark, well-sculpted line of Luciana D'Intino's mezzo. We should have heard Miss D'Intino in the recent Berlioz Troyens at the Barbican (happy though we were with her last-minute replacement, Markella Hatziano); here in Verdi, her lively maturity and judicious poise suggested the noble Dido she might have given us.

The draft has been prepared by the General Prosecutor's  Office of the Slovak Republic. We discussed the purpose and the  contents of the new law with one of its authors, Ivan Seges,  LL.D., director of the Criminal Law Department at the General  Prosecutor's Office of the Slovak Republic.    [Handzo] Could you briefly characterize the contents of the  law under preparation?    [Seges] In drafting the law, we strove to have it contain,  on the greatest scale possible, such elements as would make it  possible to vigorously crack down on manifestations of organized  crime. The draft consists, in fact, of two parts. The first  concerns legal means that make it possible to uncover attempts  at an unlawful legalization of income stemming from serious  criminal activity--that is, the so-called laundering of dirty  money. The second part defines legal means and procedures that  would make it possible to expose and document serious criminal  activity in a way that could be used as evidence in court [s  procesnou posobnostou]. The course of action by the bodies  involved in criminal proceedings has until now been formal, in a  certain way, so that findings by the criminal police that were  not obtained by the set procedures could not be used as evidence  in court.    [Handzo] What is the purpose of the proposed legal means?    [Seges] We would like to break through the principle that is  valid now, according to which it is possible to start collecting  evidence, for it to be recognized in court, only after criminal  prosecution has been formally initiated. In the case of listed  criminal acts (which are enumerated in the draft law), the  bodies involved in criminal proceedings should be permitted to  collect evidence that will be recognized in court before the  initiation of criminal prosecution. These bodies should be  endowed with such powers as would allow them to investigate  effectively, in a way that will be recognized in court, when  their crime-solving experience and other indications suggest  that they are confronted with organized crime, even if they do  not avail themselves of findings signaling a specific criminal  act.    [Handzo] Could the application of legal means permitting the  start of investigations in the event of a mere suspicion not  constitute encroachment upon basic human rights in certain cases?    [Seges] The draft law makes it possible for bodies involved  in criminal proceedings to secure evidence, in the case of  listed (enumerated) criminal acts, without there being a formal  resolution on the initiation of criminal prosecution.  Therefore, should a charge be raised, the effects of the start  of criminal prosecution would retroactively authorize even the  deployment of operational technical devices  [operativno-technickych prostriedkov], telephone tapping, or the  use of a secret agent operating under an assumed identity  (alias), who would penetrate into the criminal environment with  the aim of obtaining evidence.    It is self-evident that, in view of this being a very  serious  encroachment upon citizens' civil rights and liberties, all of  these means could be used only with the consent of the judge or  prosecutor. Opponents of this regulation argue that it is  anticonstitutional or that it restricts basic human rights.  However, the Constitution expressly states that these rights  can be restricted by law if the interest of society so requires.  And it is in the interest of society that the relevant bodies  be provided with the possibility to crack down effectively on  organized crime. No one is going to restrict the rights of  decent people....    [Handzo] The specific criminal acts authorizing the  application of the aforesaid legal means are listed in the draft  law. Which criminal acts are involved?    [Seges] This would apply, for example, to the criminal acts  of terrorism, sabotage, counterfeiting and altering money and  securities, general endangerment, endangering the safety of an  aircraft or a civilian vessel, unauthorized armament, and other  grievous criminal acts. Apart from this, we propose a provision  under which, in certain cases and with the prosecutor's consent,  the law would also apply to deliberate criminal acts, for which  the minimum sentence is five years of deprivation of freedom,  provided the circumstances of the case justify the assumption  that the act had been committed by an organized group, as  defined by this law.    [Handzo] Let us return to the issue of ""dirty-money  laundering."" What will the adoption of the law mean in  practice, from that point of view?    [Seges] The draft provides for several basic principles, the  application of which would help expose attempts at the unlawful  legalization of income stemming from serious criminal activity.  First of all, it lays down the obligation for juridical persons  and entrepreneurs to report facts suggesting the existence of  such activities. At the same time, the anonymity in relation to  financial institutions should be eliminated in a certain way, to  make it possible to identify people carrying out suspicious  banking operations. Financial institutions should be placed  under the obligation to report to the Prosecutor's Office or to  the Slovak Republic Police Corps not only instances of suspected  legalization of income stemming from organized criminal activity  but also cash deposits and withdrawals exceeding a certain sum  (for example, 100,000 Slovak korunas). The second principle is  that juridical persons and entrepreneurs are obliged to refuse  to perform acts (such as the conclusion of a contract) that  could, without doubt, be conducive to the legalization of income  stemming from serious criminal activity. Furthermore, the draft  law sets out the right, in the event of any suspicious  transactions, to ascertain the origin of the property that these  transactions concern. The last proposed provision is that a  citizen or an organization that helps uncover attempts at the  legalization of income stemming from organized criminal activity  is entitled to a reward in the amount of 10 percent of the  uncovered sum. Naturally, all of these provisions would be  applied also to machinations associated with the privatization  process.    [Handzo] Does the draft law also provide for manifestations  of organized crime associated with the criminal act of the  unauthorized production and possession of narcotic and  psychotropic substances and toxins--that is, drug-trafficking?    [Seges] As we know, existing legislation did not make it  possible, in fact, to combat more effectively these expressions  of organized crime. If a person was found to carry such a  substance and wanted to avoid criminal prosecution, often this  person only had to say that it was for his or her own need. The  draft law contains provisions under which it would be possible  to prosecute criminally everyone possessing these substances,  regardless of whether he keeps them for his own needs or for  someone else. Of course, it is up to the relevant specialized  bodies to assess in each specific case, considering the quantity  of the seized addictive substance, whether the person in  question could keep it for his or her own use.    [Handzo] What makes the struggle against organized crime  exceptionally difficult is the inadequate protection of  witnesses. Does the proposed law provide for any changes in this  regard?    [Seges] The provision of essential protection to witnesses  is one of the pillars of the draft we propose. Intimidation of  potential witnesses is one of the common practices of organized  crime. The protection of witnesses should be secured in three  ways. First, under strictly defined conditions, the law will  make it possible for them to remain anonymous; second, on the  basis of a provision in the law, it will be possible to question  them during court proceedings with the public excluded; and,  finally, when agents are concerned, their true identity will not  be revealed even during criminal proceedings.

Hundreds of demonstrators, mostly young people, swarmed into  the large avenues of Dakar after a public meeting organized by  five political parties (including the main opposition party, the  Senegalese Democratic Party of Abdoulaye Wade) to denounce the  high cost of living after the devaluation of the CFA franc by 50  percent last January.    On their route, they destroyed shops, and burned or  destroyed  vehicles and fuel stations, chanting slogans hostile to  President Abdou Diouf. Policemen who tried to intervene were  roughed up. According to witnesses, some were seriously wounded.    Despite intervention by members of the security forces, who  used tear gas in dispersing them, the demonstrators suceeded in  reaching the surroundings of the Presidential Palace. They then  took the adjacent streets, destroying several parked vehicles.    Equally violent demonstrations took place almost at the same  time in several localities in the suburb of Dakar, where  witnesses reported extensive damage.    These demonstrations came in the month of Ramadan, on the  opening day of salary negotiations between the government and  trade unions.    Yesterday, demonstrators organized by the opposition were  dispersed by security forces, who arrested about 10 people.    Early this evening, security measures were reinforced at  Plateau, an administrative and business district of Dakar, as  the demonstrators returned to their respective popular districts.    [At 2109 GMT on 16 February, AFP adds: ""Five persons -- four  members of the security forces and one civilian -- were killed  during a violent demonstration today in Dakar, according to an  official casualty report.

[Handzo] What makes the struggle against organized crime  exceptionally difficult is the inadequate protection of  witnesses. Does the proposed law provide for any changes in this  regard?    [Seges] The provision of essential protection to witnesses  is one of the pillars of the draft we propose. Intimidation of  potential witnesses is one of the common practices of organized  crime. The protection of witnesses should be secured in three  ways. First, under strictly defined conditions, the law will  make it possible for them to remain anonymous; second, on the  basis of a provision in the law, it will be possible to question  them during court proceedings with the public excluded; and,  finally, when agents are concerned, their true identity will not  be revealed even during criminal proceedings.

A statement after the four-and-one-half-hour meeting said  that the officials from the four countries reviewed the  implementation of Operation Provide Comfort II and the situation  in northern Iraq.    Representatives to the meeting were Deputy Foreign Minister  Ozdem Sanberk, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European  and Canadian Affairs Stephen Oxman, British Assistant  Undersecretary for Middle East Affairs Michael Burton and French  Foreign Minister for North Africa and Middle East Affairs Denis  Bauchard.    ""The sides expressed satisfaction with their ongoing  cooperation, which deters the renewal of fighting and provides a  framework in which humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people in the  north can be met,"" the statement said.    The statement read by Sanberk called on the Iraqi Government  to remove all the economic restrictions and embargoes it imposed  on the northern Iraqi people.    ""The participants reiterated their governments' commitment  to  the preservation of the independence, unity and territorial  integrity of Iraq -- principles on which relevant UN Security  Council resolutions are based, and which reflect the common  stand of the international community,"" it said, also stressing  that they ""reaffirmed their determined opposition to all acts  and efforts that may lead to the division and dismemberment of  Iraq.""    The parties in the meeting repeated their strong  condemnation  of terrorism and their ""full support for Turkey's right of  self-defense against the acts of violence of separatist terror  organization PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan].""    The statement added that the sides also emphasized that the  territory of Iraq should not be a safe haven for the terrorists.    Concerning the economic losses Turkey suffered because of  the  embargo on Iraq, the statement said France, Great Britain and  the United States reitrate their appreciation for Turkey's  attitude during and in the aftermath of the Gulf crisis and  recognized the continuing heavy economic burden on Turkey.    ""They will consult further for ways and means for  alleviating  that burden,"" the statement said.     "

We firmly continue our revolutionary struggle and are  willing  to sign peace if the government and Army accept to make deep  human rights, economic, and political changes in the country.

By STEVE HOCHMAN      You've probably played that little game of dreaming up the perfect concert, the  one with all your favorite acts on one bill regardless of genre.    Ian Astbury of the Cult has.    ""I was sitting in the front of the tour bus one day with my notebook, thinking,  'Wouldn't it be great if I could take the records in my collection and see a  festival with some of the best acts?',"" the English singer recalled recently in  his manager's Beverly Hills office. ""Why not an event where you could see all  this great music?""    But where most people's fantasies remain just that, Astbury's dream is coming  true. He's the force behind ""A Gathering of the Tribes,"" a two-city/two-day  festival bringing a diverse roster of rock, rap and pop acts -- and their  audiences -- together, first today at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in the Bay  Area, and Sunday at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa.    Among the performers: rockers Iggy Pop, the London Quireboys and former Sex  Pistol Steve Jones, rappers Public Enemy, Ice-T and Queen Latifah and the  folk-oriented Michelle Shocked and the Indigo Girls.    Astbury, an amiably chatty 28-year-old from Birkenhead, a town across the  Mersey River from Liverpool, explained that as he discussed his vision with  associates earlier this year, he was only expressing a fantasy.    ""It's a quality of life thing,"" he said. ""I thought it would be great to put a  diverse bill together and see if it could happen and introduce all the  segregate groups to each other. But it was nothing more than conversation,  really.""    But the Cult's agent, Bill Ellison, mentioned the idea to others, including  promoter Bill Graham, who operates the Shoreline Amphitheatre, and Alex Hodges  of the Nederlander organization, which runs the Pacific Amphitheatre.    ""Bill came back to me and said, 'Your festival's on,' "" Astbury said. ""I said,  'What do you mean?' . . .    ""I had one vision and any excuse was not good enough,"" Astbury said. ""Guns N'  Roses should be doing it, but can't due to commitments. Tracy Chapman should be  doing it. Living Colour, Ziggy Marley, Julian Lennon should be doing it.""    Still, the lineup's diversity, Astbury believes, is enough to affirm his prime  directive: ""Us and them doesn't exist any more."" The music will be supplemented  by an appearance by the American Indian Dance Theatre and representation from  various environmental and social-activist groups.    One act conspicuous in its absence is Astbury's own.    ""I didn't want the Cult to play because I didn't want people to think we were  using this to boost our career,"" Astbury explained.    He does, however, plan to jam with Jones and perhaps one or two other acts.  After all, he put together these shows as a fan, not as an artist.    ""One of the selfish reasons of having it was to see these acts perform,"" he  said.    Still Tossin': The song ""Tossin' and Turnin' "" has one of rock's great  openings. Bobby Lewis' leering delivery of the line ""I couldn't sleep at all  last night"" proved as much a grabber when imitated in a recent breakfast cereal  commercial as when the original held the No. 1 spot on the pop singles chart  for seven straight weeks in 1961.    But few would guess that in chart terms the song was the No. 3 biggest hit of  the '60s, just behind the Beatles' ""Hey Jude"" and Percy Faith's ""The Theme From  'A Summer Place'."" That will be one of the songs heard as the Legends of Rock  'n' Roll two-night stand at the Greek Theatre concludes tonight, as Lewis makes  his first Los Angeles appearance in nearly 20 years.

After 30 years of unit building, growth, combat, and  glorious  victory led by the glorious Communist Party of Vietnam,  solicitously cared for by esteemed Uncle Ho and helped and  assisted by the people, various generations of cadres,  combatants, and civilian national defense employees of the  regiment have constantly developed the character and glorious  tradition of the Vietnam People's Army as well as the tradition  of the heroic Vietnamese Air Force. They have always remained  united and singleminded and have resourcefully and bravely  overcome all difficulties, hardships, and tough ordeals.    They are noted for having invented many wise and audacious  combat tactics and for having defeated the enemy right from the  first battle, shooting down many of their modern airplanes and  scoring countless outstanding combat expoits during aerial  battles, thus contributing duly to the causes of national  liberation and unification and of building a socialist  Vietnamese fatherland.    In whatever conditions, junctures, and situations the cadres  and combatants of the regiment have always strived to display  the lofty qualities of Uncle Ho's soldiers. The regiment  therefore deserves the title of Heroic Unit of the People's  Armed Forces and the many other lofty awards given to it by the  state and the Armed Forces.    I would like to avail myself of this opportuniry to commend  the regiment for the many achievements it has scored over the  past 30 years.    I wish you, comrades, good health and more outstanding  achievements in the new revolutionary stage so as to eternally  deserve the trust and love of the party, the people, and the  Armed Forces.    My cordial and determined-to-win salutations.     "

If he has doubts about the  correctness of instructions he has received for execution he  must immediately report this in writing to his immediate  superior and the superior who gave the order.

The monetary allowance for the state employee consists  of  a salary and increments to the official salary for special  working conditions, length of service, class rank, and monetary  incentives for the results of service for the quarter or year.  The monetary allowance shall be paid out of funds of the  republic budget of the Russian Federation.    The procedure for assignment and the amounts of the salaries  of state employees and increments to salaries for special  working conditions, length of service, and class rank shall be  established by legislation of the Russian Federation.

The pension for length of service for the state employee  shall be established in the amount of 80 percent of the monetary  allowance in the position held on the day of termination of  state service or on the day the employee reaches the age that  gives him the right to go on old age pension.    The aforementioned pension shall be subject to periodic  revision based on increases in the monetary allowance of state  employees in the corresponding positions or based on the  increased cost of living according to the procedure for  indexation in keeping with legislative acts of the Russian  Federation.    The payment of pensions for length of service shall be made  within the limits of the maximum amount of the old age pension  out of funds of the Russian Federation's Pension Fund, and in  the event that this sum is exceeded, the excess amount shall be  paid out of funds of the republic budget of the Russian  Federation.

Periods when the state employee was absent do not count for the  probationary period. The present Statute shall apply to the  state employee during the probationary period.    If the leader of a state organ deems the result of the  probation unsatisfactory, by a decision of the competition  commission the state employee may be recommended for appointment  to the state position he held previously or, with his consent,  another state position, or he may be discharged from the state  service.    If after the probationary period no negative decisions are  reached concerning the suitability of the state employee for  work in the position he holds, he is considered to have passed  probation, no additional decisions are made concerning his  appointment, and the probationary period is included in his  length of state service or the given kind of state service.    27.

It renewed its rejection of the ""undertaking  statement"" which the occupation forces want the detainees to  sign before they can be released from detention centers.    A statement issued by Hamas, a copy of which AL-HAYAH's  Damascus bureau has received, says: ""We demand the immediate  release of Shaykh Yasin and his detained brothers. We condemn  discrimination between detainees on the basis of their political  and ideological positions. Yasin has rejected all the enemies'  bargaining over his release. He has also turned down the offers  made by (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin and (Foreign  Minister Shim'on) Peres to release him immediately in return for  supporting the so-called peace agreement.""    The movement warned of ""the deterioration of Yasin's health.  We condemn the obstruction of his receiving medical treatment  and undergoing surgical operations and the enemy government's  persistence in refusing to allow a national team to supervise  Ahmad Yasin's treatment. We hold the Rabin government  responsible for anything that may happen to him.""    The movement renewed its absolute rejection of ""the  humiliating document (the undertaking statement) which the enemy  authorities"" say must be signed. The movement said that ""while  Hamas salutes the steadfastness of Palestine's Shaykh and his  brothers detained in the occupation jails, it stresses that  their detention will lead only to further escalation and  resistance against the occupation. All sincere people and  mujahidin will continue their efforts to secure the release of  Shaykh Yasin and his heroic brothers.""    Meanwhile, a statement issued by the ""Palestinian Forces  Alliance"" opposed to the Oslo accord has urged governments of  the Arab and Islamic states and international organizations to  work to secure Yasin's release. It said: ""It is meaningless to  release some detainees and continue to hold others. Human  rights are indivisible.""    Abu-Hamad Mustafa, Hamas' representative in Damascus, told  AL-HAYAH that the alliance yesterday staged a sit-in outside the  International Red Cross offices. Alliance representatives  demanded Yasin's release. Hamas' representative added that the  representatives submitted a memorandum to the UN office for  delivery to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali.     "

In recent years, the Georgian Parliament commissions, state  bodies, and scientific establishments have not prepared a single  legislative act that has been of vital importance for the  political, economic, and social development of the country. At  the same time, legislative activity is lagging behind the  demands of contemporary life; many spheres of social relations  are being regulated in accordance with old legal norms  pertaining to other social and political systems; the  development of new social relations is being hindered by the  corresponding legal disorder; new civil, criminal, labor,  administrative, and prison codes and a code of civil procedure  should be elaborated without which the systematic development of  current legislation is impossible. It is necessary to organize  anew the protection of the law, investigations, the Procurator's  Office, and the courts and the principles governing these  activities.    Proceeding from this:    1. With the aim of preparing draft basic legislative acts,  codes, and other acts in the fundamental branches of the law, a  state commission on legal reform is to be created that will be  attached to the Republic of Georgia Ministry of Justice. It  will be composed of the following persons:    Tevdore Ninidze -- Republic of Georgia Minister of  Justice (commission chairman);    Mindia Ugrekhelidze -- chairman of the Republic  of Georgia Supreme Court (cochairman);    Jamlet Bibiliashvili -- acting Republic of Georgia  procurator general (cochairman);    Shota Kviria -- Republic of Georgia minister of  internal affairs (cochairman);    Igor Giorgadze -- Republic of Georgia minister of  security (cochairman);    Tengiz Liluashvili -- director of the Academy of  Sciences State and Law Institute (cochairman, chairman of the  Commission for Legislation on Civil Procedure);    Sergo Jorbenadze -- holder of the chair of civil  law and civil procedure in the Law Faculty at Tbilisi State  University (chairman of the Commission for Civil Legislation);    Giorgi Tqeshelidze -- holder of the chair of  criminal law in the Law Faculty at Tbilisi State University  (chairman of the Commission for Legislation on Criminal Law);    Iakob Putkaradze -- head of the Department of  State and International Law at the Georgian Academy of Sciences  State and Law Institute (chairman of the Commission for  Constitutional Legislation);    Apolon Paliashvili -- holder of the chair of  justice and supervision by the Procurator's Office at Tbilisi  State University (chairman of the Commission for Legislation on  Criminal Procedure);    Valeri Loria -- holder of the chair of the  principles of the law and legal education at Tbilisi State  University (chairman of the Commission for Administrative  Legislation);    Gia Meparishvilvi -- associate professor in the  Law Faculty at Tbilisi State University (chairman of the  Commission for the Organization of Activities To Protect the  Law);    Lado Chanturia -- associate professor in the Law  Faculty at Tbilisi State University (chairman of the Commission  for Agrarian Legislation);    Roland Giligashvili -- Republic of Georgia deputy  procurator general (chairman of the Commission for Prison  Legislation).    2. The statutes of the State Commission for Legal Reform,  the composition of branch commissions, and the plan for  preparing draft legislative acts are to be approved by the  chairman of the state commission.    3. The Republic of Georgia Cabinet of Ministers is to  approve the composition and [budget] estimate of the State  Commission for Legal Reform on the basis of proposals submitted  by the chairman of the State Commission for Legal Reform.    4. The working period of the State Commission for Legal  Reform is to be 1994-95.    5.

At a news conference, the Vice President said violent acts  could definitely create chaos before the referendum. These are  censurable terrorist acts that cannot be tolerated and the  government has a duty to punish the wrongdoers, he added.    The Army Rules Out Existence of Urban Guerrilla Force    Army spokesman Edith Vargas de Marroquin denied the  existence  of an urban guerrilla force, but indirectly accused the  insurgents of the terrorist attacks carried out 18th Street,  Zone 1, on Wednesday and in front of Congress Sunday morning.  ""These attacks were perpetrated as the Poor People's Guerrilla  Army (EGP) celebrates its anniversary and it is unfortunate that  in order to make their presence felt they affect the lives of  innocent people. In addition, it is irresponsible, because they  employ methods that endanger the population,"" she said.    The Government Rejects Congressmen's Allegations    Presidential Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli denied  the allegations of several legislators who accuse the government  and the Army of provoking the current situation. ""These are  absurd and irresponsible accusations, since not only the  government, but the people themselves are asking for the  legislators' resignations. Unfortunately, this is absurd and  inhumane terrorism, since any differences can be resolved  through dialogue,"" he added.    Violent Acts Have International Impact    For his part, Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso said  these incidents occurred a few days before the referendum, which  leads one to believe they could be fueled by radical groups that  do not want a change in policy. Ortiz does not believe the  violence is being promoted by legally registered political  parties, or by popular groups. Visibly irritated, he said ""the  [responsibility for the] blood spilled should fall on the  wrongdoers.""    He again pointed out that these incidents occurred at a time  when the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the  government are getting ready to renew negotiations to end the  more than 30 years of armed conflict.

This has taught ""a lesson"" to the  British Government, which interfered in its internal affairs.    The deportation of the ambassador of a foreign country is  not  a minor matter on which the decision can be easily made in  diplomatic affairs. The Sudanese Government showed the British  ambassador the door only after it had conclusive evidence  proving he had ""interfered in something which had nothing to do  with him."" The British Foreign Ministry afterward asked the  Sudanese Government to reconsider the decision and has now  announced the deporting of the Sudanese ambassador from London.  However, this unreasonable move cannot change the fact that  Britain has interfered in the internal affairs of another  country and it only shows the phantom of the former British  Empire refuses to leave.    Here, we might as well look back at an event which occurred  over 100 years ago. If the British Government is not forgetful,  it should remember better than others how Gordon died in the  Sudan. As a colonial governor, Gordon was insufferably arrogant  and acted like a tyrant. He was, of course, more imposing than  the present British ambassador to Sudan. However, when the  Sudan national hero Mahdi started an uprising, the vigorous and  heroic struggle against the British colonial rule immediately  swept across Sudan and the people captured Khartoum. The  feeling of the fighters in the uprising was high and they  pierced Gordon's body with a sharp spear. This butcher, whose  hands had once been stained with the blood of the Chinese  people, finally died on the staircase of the British governor's  residence. This was a punishment meted out by history for the  colonialist.    What is surprising is that today, when the world has  developed to the end of the 20th century and every shred of the  ""prestige"" of the British Empire has been swept away, some  people in the British Government are still following the example  of their ancestors and are engaged in activities which interfere  in the internal affairs of other countries. They really show no  understanding of the times.     "

0,FT932-17358 ,"FT932-17358 _AN-DDACLADVFT 930401   FT  01 APR 93 / Arts: Behrens and the LPO - Concert      By DAVID MURRAY   It was really Hildegard Behrens' concert at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday - the London Philharmonic was there too, but only to accompany her in Wagner and Strauss, and to supply a prelude. The latter was Mahler's full string-band version (1894) of Schubert's 'Death and the Maiden' Quartet. This curiosity, reconstructed from Mahler's annotations on a printed quartet score, has become unaccountably popular among conductors. None of them manages to make massed violins sound remotely plausible in the high, flickering descants of the Allegro. That was the sort of thing Mahler would soon be writing for first-violin sections in his own symphonies, but in Schubert it sounds grotesque. Here, the brave collective effort sometimes swallowed up the main tunes on lower strings, as a solo leader could never do. The conductor Franz Welser-Most ensured that all of it was at least 'interesting', with enough dynamic hairpins to supply an Expressionist hairdresser for several weeks. In the great Tristan und Isolde Prelude he achieved smoothness and musical efficiency, nothing much like erotic anguish or desperate surges (loud, yes; desperate, no). Then Miss Behrens took up the 'Liebestod', initially in tremulous or perhaps just curdled tones: hard to be sure which] Concluding a strenuous performance of the whole opera, the effect might seize one's heart; but Isolde must soar at last in the 'Liebestod' - and Miss Behrens did not, because the voice exerted no rhythmic grip of its own. Soaring needs a firm springboard. 'Mild und leise' to a fault, the Behrens soprano floated loosely, with too many consonants disappearing altogether over Welser-Most's fluent accompaniment. The special virtue, or confluence of virtues, that has justified Miss Behrens' career is that her fine, unshowy intelligence complements a voice which is soft-grained, and yet large and penetrating enough to compete in heroic roles with steelier sopranos. In the Salome peroration she was grandly audible throughout the orchestral eruptions, but also palpably feminine and vulnerable - no ferocious Brunnhilde overtones, such as turn many an operatic Salome into an obsessed monster. (That is meant as a musico-biological observation, not a 'sexist' remark.) Behrens conveyed a lethal passion with impassioned innocence.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The circular noted: Xu Honggang is the squad leader of a  signal company of a certain regiment of the Jinan Military  Region [JMR]. Born in Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, in March  1971, he joined the Army in December 1990 and the party in July  1993. On 17 August 1993, he took a bus back to his unit after a  home leave. When the bus was traveling through the territory of  Junlian County, Sichuan Province, four criminals extorted money  from a female passenger and resorted to wanton insults. Xu  Honggang stepped forward bravely to her rescue. He received 14  stab wounds in his chest, stomach, and arms in the courageous  struggle against the criminals and over 50 centimeters of his  intestines dangled out of a slit in his stomach. Holding the  dangling intestines with his sleeveless sweater, he jumped from  the bus out of the window to chase the criminals despite acute  pain. He passed out on the road during the chase and, after  all-out efforts by local people and hospital to save him, took a  turn for the better and was out of danger.    Xu Honggang's deed of valor, which demonstrates a readiness  to take up the cudgels for a just cause, has evoked strong  repercussions in and outside the Army. Recently, party and  state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, and Hu  Jintao, plus CMC Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen, successively received  and commended him. They praised him as a fine son of the people  and a hero of the PLA and called on all the people across the  country and all the Army's officers and men to learn from him.  On 10 January 1994, the JMR conferred the title of honor  ""Combat Hero Who Readily Takes up the Cudgels for a Just Cause""  on him. The CYL Central Committee named him a ""Young Hero Who  Readily Takes Up the Cudgels for a Just Cause"" and conferred on  him the title of ""New Long March Shock Worker of the Nation"" on  1 February 1994.    The circular pointed out: The heroic feat of Comrade Xu  Honggang's courageous struggle against criminals in defiance of  brute force as well as the touching concern and deep love shown  by the local party and government leadership and by the local  people for him is an ode to an era in which we endeavor to build  socialist spiritual civilization and a song in praise of  righteousness sung by the Army together with the people under  the conditions of establishing and developing a socialist market  economy. It was not by accident that Xu Honggang became a  combat hero. Born in Wumengshan, a mountainous area through  which the Red Army traversed on its Long March, he was nurtured  under the gradual, uplifting influence of the Red Army  tradition. After his enlistment, he joined a unit of the ""iron  army"" which has a glorious history. He carries out the behest  of the martyrs and carries forward the fine tradition. In  particular, the education conducted by the unit in outlook on  life and value laid a solid foundation for his growing up in  recent years. He was successively commended as a ""pacesetter of  military training,"" an ""outstanding CYL member,"" and a  ""pacesetter of learing from Lei Feng,"" and received eight  citations. He has proved himself to be a fine descendant of the  Red Army, an excellent fighter of our Army, and an outstanding  representative of the youth of our times. He is the pride of  not only the Army, but also youth and all of society.    The circular points out: To encourage new healthy practices;  to safeguard social stability; to strengthen the building of  socialist spiritual civilization; to ensure the smooth progress  of reform, opening up, and the establishment of a socialist  market economic structure; and to facilitate a sustained, rapid,  healthy growth of the national economy, the GPD and the CYL  Central Committee have decided to energetically launch an  emulation drive around Comrade Xu Honggang and to extensively  publicize his heroic deeds and noble ideas among all PLA troops  and youngsters at large across the country. They should emulate  his outstanding political quality of devoting himself to the  party, the motherland, the people, the Army, and the  modernization drive; his spirit of carrying forward the fine  traditions of the party and the Army, conscientiously  implementing the objective of serving the people wholeheartedly,  and willingly sacrificing everything for the sake of the  people's interests; his profound sense of responsibility in  striving to improve his military skills for the honor of the  Army, scrupulously performing duties, and practicing new social  mores and customs; and his heroism of readily taking up the  cudgels for a just cause, facing danger fearlessly, and daring  to make a sacrifice. All Army commanders and fighters should  also emulate the touching deeds of the local party and  government leaders as well as the masses in caring for and  cherishing the people's soldiers, and should conscientiously  learn from the masses and launch more extensively activities of  supporting the government and cherishing the people, so as to  further strengthen unity between the Army and the government and  between militarymen and civilians. In the course of the  emulation drive, it is necessary to teach officers and men as  well as youngsters to arm their minds with the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to foster the  correct ideals, faith, outlook on the life, and value concepts;  to bring into play the ""five revolutionary spirits"" advocated by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the ""64-character poineering spirit""  proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin; and to resist money worship,  ultraindividualism, and the inroads of a decadent life-style.  It is also necessary to foster a healthy atmosphere of admiring  heroes, emulating the advanced, acting heroically, and finding  it a pleasure to help others, so as to promote the Army's  revolutionization, modernization, and regularization and to  deepen the CYL's ""cross-century project of youth civilization""  and ""cross-century project of young talents."" Local CYL  organizations should mobilize young volunteers to launch a  campaign to serve heroes in order to create a lively situation  of emulating and serving heroes.     "
0,FT943-7930 ,"FT943-7930 _AN-EHUAWAAEFT 940820   FT  20 AUG 94 / Contracts with Algiers at risk, warns Islamic Front      By FRANCIS GHILES      PARIS   The main Islamic party battling to take power in Algeria warned foreign governments and companies yesterday that contracts signed since the January 1992 general election may be at risk. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which was denied certain victory in the election when the government cancelled the poll, warned violence would worsen if the Algiers government did not open a dialogue. Mr Rabah Khebir, spokesman for the FIS, said in an interview with the Financial Times that all contracts signed since the election could be considered illegal if FIS came to power. Agreements amounting to billions of dollars would be reviewed. Mr Khebir added, however, that it was in Algeria's economic interest to remain open to the west. But western governments also carried a heavy responsibility for the future course of events in his country, where Islamic militants have recently stepped up attacks on foreign nationals. The FIS spokesman, who fled Algeria two years ago, said western governments could help establish a dialogue with the Algiers government, but ruled out the participation of France 'because of its attitude'. France has recently clamped down on members of FIS and other Islamic activists. He claimed that FIS had always denounced the killing of foreigners (59 have died), and said the leadership had done all it could to dissuade its supporters from carrying out acts of sabotage against oil and gas installations. Exports of hydrocarbons should be worth about Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn) this year and provide Algeria with 97 per cent of its foreign income. But as the overall level of violence increased, the risks of such acts occurring could only get greater, Mr Khebir said. 'The regime would be well advised to talk to us,' he added. At least 10,000 Algerians are estimated to have died in political violence since the beginning of 1992 and diplomats estimated that the death toll is running at about 300 a week.

This followed the iniquitous aggression  by the forces of the Republican Guard, the Central Security, and  the military police against the martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade Camp in  Dhamar town where this daring brigade confronted, with rare  heroism and outstanding bravery, the multitudes of these  aggressive forces and inflicted a crushing defeat on them.    At exactly 9 o'clock on 4 May, a unit of the Central  Security  carried out an act of aggression against Sawlaban Camp and an  attack on Aden international airport in an attempt to occupy it  or destroy it. However, this attempt quickly failed. Our  forces managed to settle the situation quickly in their favor,  and the battalion of military police refused to obey the orders  of Sanaa to fight against their brothers, the sons of all the  Yemeni people. All the battalion's members joined our forces.  [passage omitted]    And in a dangerous development of the military and political  situation, the adventurist gang in Sanaa resorted to using  military aircraft. The citizens of Aden this morning were  surprised by a pair of warplanes attacking Aden international  airport, but our vigilant air defenses confronted this attack  which did not achieve any success worth mentioning.    In response, our fighter aircraft attacked Sanaa, Ta'izz,  and  al-Hudaydah airport, paralyzing these airports to stop them from  being used by this (?reckless) gang in its bloody criminal acts  against our people. While the Defense Ministry decisively  confronts the adventurist acts of the bloody gang of al-Ahmar  family, it notes with extreme gratification that many members of  our armed forces and units who are under the control of the  Sanaa gang, have refused to fight against their brothers.  Another large number joined our forces who are defending unity  and democracy. [passage omitted]     "

""But I came to the  horrid realization that it costs money to die poor: You've got to get to Paris,  rent an apartment, buy all those cobwebs -- the whole bit.""    The then 19-year-old graduate of the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles  never realized his romantic dream of painting and dying young in Paris, and the  arts of animation and film comedy are richer for it.    He got a job as a cel washer at the Ub Iwerks Studio in Beverly Hills, cleaning  the ink off sheets of acetate so they could be reused. This humble beginning  led to a brilliant career in animation: Jones went on to create Wile E. Coyote,  the Road Runner and Pepe LePew, and to direct many of the best cartoons with  Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd.    He won three Oscars, a Peabody Award and ASIFA/Hollywood's Annie Award, and has  been honored by the British Film Institute, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts  and Sciences and film festivals all over the world.    A longtime resident of Newport Beach, Jones, now 77, chronicled his life and  career in his recent book ""Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated  Cartoonist"" (Farrar Straus Giroux). Rambling, informal and very funny, part  memoir, part sketchbook and part how-to-animate manual, ""Chuck Amuck"" has  received rave reviews in magazines and newspapers across the country.    Animators usually are portrayed as tongue-tied artists who can communicate only  through their drawings, or as loony-bin zanies whose antics rival their  characters. Jones shatters both stereotypes: In person, he is articulate, witty  and charming.    He discusses animation, literature, art history and politics with equal zest,  and quotes Santayana's definition of a fanatic (""One who redoubles his effort  after he loses sight of his goal"") to describe Wile E. Coyote's monomaniac  pursuit of the Road Runner. The improbable pairing of the author of ""Realms of  Being"" with the hilariously inept Coyote sums up the breadth of Jones'  interests.    The cels-washing job didn't last long: Jones soon was promoted to assistant  animator, then full-fledged animator. He worked briefly for Charles Mintz and  Walter Lantz before settling down at the Leon Schlesinger studio, making Looney  Tunes and Merrie Melodies.    ""Coming out of art school during the Depression, the idea of getting a job was  surprising,"" Jones recalls. ""The idea of getting a job doing something you  liked was beyond belief.""    Promoted to director in 1938, Jones made his best films after World War II when  he, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson each headed a unit at Warner Bros.,  turning out 10 six-minute cartoons a year. All three directors used many of the  same characters and gags, but they approached the material differently.    The hallmarks of Jones' mature style are crispness, clarity and subtlety. Of  the Warner directors, he was the most strongly influenced by the Disney films,  especially the appealing designs and vivid character animation of master  animator Fred Moore. Tex Avery might make a character's eyes swell to the size  of searchlights, or fly across the room to ogle a pretty girl; Jones would have  the character glance quickly at the audience or flicker an eyebrow. He cites  the influence of Buster Keaton and the other great silent comics on his use of  body language and expressions that make the characters in his films seem like  living, thinking beings.    ""I went on the supposition -- although I probably wasn't able to verbalize it  -- that every character I worked with had to come from inside myself,"" he  explains. ""To make a heroic allusion, Laurence Olivier said he never had to  leave himself when he acted; similarly, Daffy Duck is inside me. So is Bugs  Bunny, in the sense that he's what I'd like to be, but Daffy is what I know  full well I am: You can dream about being Bugs, but when you look in the mirror  in the morning, you see Daffy.    ""I learned the first thing you need to have in a film is believability,"" he  continues. ""Believability is the character standing there on the ground --  which poses the same problem Degas and all painters have: The viewer has to  believe that character is really standing there, that he's part of the Earth,  with weight. If a character's believable, you can try to evoke sympathy for  him. The audience has to care about the people they're watching for you to  create lasting humor. Believability, sympathy (through character development)  and humor are the way to tickle people and make them laugh.""    It's easy to spot these ideas at work in Jones' postwar films such as ""One  Froggy Evening,"" ""Duck Amuck,"" ""Rabbit of Seville,"" ""Long-Haired Hare,"" ""A Bear  for Punishment"" and ""Robin Hood Daffy."" It's extremely difficult to communicate  subtle nuances of expression and behavior in animation, and many of the best  young animators cite Jones as an important influence on their own work.    ""You couldn't hope for a better example of the pure principles of animation at  work than Chuck Jones' cartoons,"" says Duncan Majoribanks, who did the key  animation of Sebastian, the calypso-voiced crab in Disney's current release  ""The Little Mermaid."" ""What I love best about his films is the acting: His  characters are the most fully rounded personalities ever animated -- they're at  least the equal of any live actors of the period.""    ""In a lot of his films, Jones makes the character think about what he's doing  before he does it, as opposed to just moving the character around,"" agrees Nik  Ranieri, who did animation for both ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Who Framed Roger  Rabbit."" ""Even if the character's not speaking, you can see the thought process  going on. His films have definitely influenced my own work in the way I  approach a scene and act it out: I try to keep the subtlety of his approach in  mind, and get the idea across in one drawing as opposed to a violent action.""    The influence of his comic timing, especially in the Road Runner-Coyote series,  extends into the realm of live-action film making. Steven Spielberg (who wrote  the forward to ""Chuck Amuck""), Peter Bogdanovich and Joe Dante are among the  directors who pay tribute to Jones' work. The kids in Dante's ""Gremlins""  attended Charles Martin Jones Jr. High School.    ""I don't look back to specific moments in cartoons to imitate in my films, but  there is a general sense of timing you pick up watching cartoons,"" Dante says.  ""Cartoons and features are very different, especially spatially, but verbal  timing is very important in both, and the timing in Chuck's dialogue scenes is  really unmatched. I've often thought that Chuck could have been a good feature  director. If he had the kind of rapport with actors that he did with animators  and voice people, he would have made some interesting films.""    Jones appears and acts considerably younger than his 77 years. In addition to  signing hundreds of books, he keeps busy advising on films, drawing and  painting. One of his current projects is a series of lithographs of the Warners  characters, done in the style of various Impressionist and Post-Impressionist  artists. His most recent Christmas card was a deft spoof of a Toulouse-Lautrec  poster, with Daffy Duck as La Golue.    He insists that he didn't plan on writing ""Chuck Amuck"" until his wife, Marian  Dern Jones, who used to write the syndicated comic strip ""Rick O'Shay,"" started  a book on their life together, ""How Can I Kiss You When I'm Laughing.""    ""She did a great beginning on it, so we put a dummy together and took it to New  York,"" he says. ""But the publishers there said, 'She's writing about somebody  nobody knows about: We figure it'd be a good idea for you to write a book  first, to justify her writing one.' So that's how it all started. Nothing's  ever done for the logical reason, is it?""

The Islamic Hamas resistance group has  threatened to start a war in the occupied territories. Can  there be peace at all and an agreement between the PLO and  Israel under these conditions?    [Peres] The Israeli Government will continue to fight  against terror with all its available means. Yet, we will not  interrupt the peace negotiations for a single moment and we will  continue with great determination to put the Gaza-Jericho  agreement into practice. These murderers not only want to kill  innocent people, but they want to stop the peace process. Any  interruption of the negotiations would be a reward for these  murderous terrorists.

As soon as this  group arrives in Hebron, we hope the atmosphere will calm down.  However, I would like to repeat and emphasize: There can be no  substitute for cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians;  together we must create the basis for coexistence in peace.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] What assistance for a peaceful solution do  you expect from the international community of states and from  Germany, in particular?    [Peres] The international community of states and Germany  have already committed themselves very strongly. They support  the economic development of the countries in the Middle East.  Of particular importance is the improvement in the  Palestinians' standard of living. If we manage to improve their  lives, then we will also be able to convince other Arabs who are  our neighbors that peace is an advantage for everyone.     "

Last year, 135 people were awarded the title of hero for  their unexcelled self-sacrificing spirit, patriotic devotion and  creative activity for the country and the people, for the  society and collective.    Among them are heroes of the Republic Hwang Yong-chun and Yu  Kyong-nam and labor heroes Kwon Sun-hui, Yi Ung-su and Yi  Sung-ha.    Yi In-mo, a former war correspondent of the Korean People's  Army, who underwent unspeakable sufferings behind bars in South  Korea for 34 years, maintaining his patriotic principle, was  embraced by the great homeland last year and awarded the gold  star medal of the hero of the Republic amid blessings of all the  people.    Hwang Yong-chun rendered distinguished service in defending  the country, while serving as a soldier until he was 37 years  old though he received demobilization orders six times. Yu  Kyong-nam died at the age of 22 while serving in the Army. He  saved scores of his comrades by covering with his body a  handgrenade on the point of explosion.    Among the heroes are those who distinguished themselves in  socialist economic construction, effected innovations in  production and contributed to the development of the nation's  science, education and literature and art.    It is unthinkable apart from the noblest benevolent politics  of the illustrious leader that a good many people have become  heroes while defending socialism.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published a historic  work ""Let us All Live and Struggle Like Heroes"" in May 1988. In  the work he said that to live like a hero and to become a hero  is the only valuable and worthy life for a [word indistinct] man  and encouraged all the people to perform heroic feats.    Thus heroism of the Korean people that originated from the  anti- Japanese revolutionary struggle is being given a fuller  scope in grand socialist construction today after years of the  arduous yet worthwhile revolution.    Mass heroism and unexcelled devotion have been fully  displayed in all sectors of the national economy, producing many  heroes of the Republic and labor heroes every year.    Heroes in the Army and among the people remain loyal to the  leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great brilliant commander.  This is the true appearance of the Korean society.     "

This measure was taken  after the extremists in Ward A and Ward B in al-Istiqbal  rejected the entry into their wards of members belonging to  Hasan al-Hillawi.    A joint statement released inside the prison by the  leaderships of the al-Jihad Organization and the Islamic Group  accused al-Hillawi of supporting the security agencies,  deviating from the consensus, and of being traitors and spies.  They sanctioned their murder. They took this measure to  prevent other members from joining al-Hillawi, who declared his  rejection of acts of violence prevailing among the extremist  groups.    Al-Hillawi used the hospital in the al-Istiqbal Prison as a  shelter for himself and his 50-member group and sought a  dialogue with the leaders of the Islamic Group, particularly  Najih Ibrahim. The latter, however, rejected al-Hillawi and  accused him of being a traitor and spy. Heated arguments took  place between al-Hillawi and members of the al-Jihad  Organization and they were about to engage in fistfights and  hand-to-hand fighting. But policemen intervened, disengaged  the two groups, and decided to move the al-Hillawi followers to  the Mazra'at Turrah Prison.    The recent crisis, the second disturbance in the al-Jihad  Organization after the Muhammad al-Makkawi dissension from  al-Zawahiri, who is living abroad, began when a fax reached Arab  and foreign newspapers signed by Hasan al-Hillawi. Al-Hillawi  is a prominent figure in the al-Jihad Organization and  participated in military sedition in 1977. The fax urged the  extremist groups to exercise self-restraint, stop acts of  violence, lay down their arms, and hold a dialogue with the  government to ease restrictions on detainees. He expressed  readiness to hold this dialogue and declared that it is  inadmissible to oppose the ruler and form groups opposed to the  regime. Although the fax caused confusion among al-Jihad  Organization ranks abroad and raised questions about  al-Hillawi's role in the al-Istiqbal Prison, a lawyer on the  detainees' defense panel asked to meet al-Hillawi on  instructions from abroad to discuss his call and make sure that  he appeared, particularly as he is considered to be an important  intellectual leader in the al-Jihad Organization. The lawyer  met al-Hillawi and asked him what he wanted. Al-Hillawi  answered: I urge the groups to give up acts of violence and I  will undertake a dialogue with the government. At the meeting,  which was also attended by Ahmad Rashid Muhammad Rashid, one of  the most important figures in the Vanguards of Conquest, the  lawyer accused al-Hillawi of trying to get out of jail by any  means, that he was weakening, and that he no longer put up any  resistance. The lawyer advised the group members abroad on the  details of the meeting. Despite the threats that the al-Jihad  members inside the prison made to al-Hillawi to return to the  fold, he rejected them and gained the support of 50 extremists.  He thus established an independent organization and began  making calls denouncing violence and calling for dialogue. The  groups inside the prison considered these calls to be a  deviation from the course by a leading intellectual figure who  played a major role in the military sedition and the  reorganization of the al-Jihad Organization (Case No. 401 of  1977). They feared that his influence might spread to the rest  of the groups and create problems with other members. Bloody  clashes would have occurred had the prison administration not  intervened, saving al-Hillawi and his group from certain death  by moving them to the Mazra'at Turrah Prison.    Disputes continue, involving the leaderships of the  extremists abroad and Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Jihad leader abroad,  and Muhammad al-Makkawi, who is accused in State Security Case  No. 401, known as the reorganization of the al-Jihad  Organization. Attempts by members of the group in Egypt,  particularly lawyers, failed to resolve the dispute despite  reports that al-Zawahiri traveled to Europe and that al-Makkawi  left Pakistan and joined tribes on the border fearing manhunts  by the Pakistani authorities of Arabs there.

It is unlikely,  however, that the country will be engulfed in a cycle of  violence.    Only a few weeks ago, Jordan was one of the most stable Arab  countries, despite isolated events over the past two or three  years. But early in February, Jordan was hit by a cycle of  violence that had disturbed some Arab countries. In just one  week two explosions rocked two movie theaters: in Amman on 27  January and in al-Zarqa', the second-largest city, on 1  February. Also, unidentified gunmen assassinated 'Umran  al-Ma'ayitah, first secretary at the Jordanian embassy, in  Beirut.    What has given rise to fears in Arab and Jordanian circles  is  that the security problems have been the result of two factors:  first, the emergence of a crisis in Jordanian-Iranian relations,  when Amman asked Tehran to withdraw 21 Iranian diplomats from  the embassy in Amman. And, second, the official Jordanian  announcement that the perpetrators were ""Jordanian Afghans""  [reference to Jordanians who fought in Afghanistan]. The  connection between the security problems and the crisis with  Iran and the Arab Afghans gives the situation a political  dimension that triggers fears.    Although Jordan has not officially announced that there is a  crisis with Iran, and Tehran radio has denied any crisis between  the two countries, the Jordanian request for the withdrawal of  21 Iranian diplomats could reflect Jordanian indignation,  according to political circles in Amman. They say that the  Jordanian authorities accuse Iranian diplomats of meeting with  Jordanian Muslim extremists.    Western sources in Amman say that Jordan is not happy with  the presence of Iranian ambassador in Amman Ahmad Dastmalchian,  who is a former Iranian Revolution guard and played a  significant role in establishing Lebanon's Hizballah. However,  this has not yet been confirmed.    At any rate, the diplomatic crisis between the two countries  is not the only explanation for the outbreak of violence in  Jordan. Other circles link these acts to the big strides that  Jordan has made on the road to peace. The events occurred a  week after King Husayn announced in Washington that he is ready  to meet in public with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.  Other circles, however, believe that the incidents were linked,  that is, the crisis with Iran coincided with the Jordanian  monarch's announcement.    The question is: Are these isolated events transient or are  they a prelude to an era of violence in Jordan? This is a  particularly important question after the strongly worded  statement by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' that  Jordan's political options could affect its internal stability.    It is difficult to answer this question. However, it is most  unlikely that the situation in Jordan will become as serious as  in some countries, such as in the Arab east or Arab Maghreb.  This is because the acts of violence in Algeria, and in a less  critical degree in Egypt, are prompted by difficult economic  conditions and unemployment. This, however, is not the case in  Jordan because the economic situation there is not that bad.  Some people even say that the Jordanian economy has improved  over the past two years. This is explained in the retreat of  the Islamic movement in the recent legislative elections, when  it won only 18 out of 81 seats in the parliament. The movement  had 32 seats in the past.    Furthermore, the Islamic movement in Jordan is different  from  that in Algeria or Egypt. It is a movement that has never  resorted to violence and has accepted functioning in accordance  with the democratic game. The Islamic movement in Jordan has  continuously maintained good relations with authorities.    Hence, perhaps this cycle of violence is a transient wave  linked to specific tactics by certain regional and local forces,  unless there are plans to involve Jordan in the acts of violence.    It is premature to assess the events in Jordan. It is also  difficult to say that the storm is over or that it will assume  different shapes. What has happened should alert us, but it  does not require us to reconsider our stances. What has  happened cannot be more than a slight setback linked to certain  tactics that are not aimed at sabotaging the strategic stability  of Jordan, which represents an important link in the peace  process.

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.     The very restricted range of the San Xavier talussnail makes it vulnerable to extinction from relatively small-scale human actions. The only known habitat for the species is on a single rockslide near Tucson, Arizona, in an area of limestone talus about 15 by 30 m (50 by 100 ft) near a dirt road. The habitat is located downslope from a dirt road, making it vulnerable to infiltration of rocks and soil or other material. The species is so restricted in range that it is threatened by even limited removal of cover through vandalism or by individuals curious about the presence of a rare species. Removal of cover, including both rocks and vegetation, harms snails by exposing them to the drying effects of the sun and periods of low ambient humidity.     The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the San Xavier talussnail as endangered. The species has a highly restricted range, is located in an area of growing urban development and active mining, and is easily accessible by road. Although the San Xavier talussnail is on private land, Federal actions may occur as the area continues to develop. Endangered status is most appropriate because the single known population could be destroyed by one action. Because of the vulnerability of the population, threatened status does not appear appropriate for the San Xavier talussnail. A decision to take no action would exclude this species from needed protection available under the Act, and the species would likely decline. The decision not to propose critical habitat for the San Xavier talussnail is explained in the following section.       Critical Habitat         Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at the time a species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for the San Xavier talussnail at this time.     The extremely restricted habitat of the species makes it vulnerable to collection and isolated acts of vandalism. Although there are relatively few amateur collectors of land snails, a single collection effort under advantageous conditions could severely deplete the species' population. The population could, however, withstand some limited, regulated scientific collection. Of greater concern than collection is the potential for acts of vandalism that directly kill the snails by crushing or by habitat disturbances that cause desiccation of the snails. These acts may sometimes be purposeful, but may also be caused by well-intentioned persons who are curious about the presence of an endangered species. The likelihood of these potential threats occurring would be greatly increased by designation of critical habitat, because the publication of critical habitat maps and descriptions would allow unauthorized persons to precisely identify the locality of this species. Identification of critical habitat would therefore increase the degree of threat to this species.     Critical habitat designation would also not provide additional benefit to the species. The range and major ecological requirements of this species are sufficiently known to provide adequate protection through the Act's take prohibitions and application of the section 7 jeopardy standard. The Service will continue to communicate the conservation needs of the species to the involved landowner, as well as inform the landowner of the status of legal protection and conservation planning for the species.         Available Conservation Measures         Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals.

The trial run made on several occasions covered the  long distance from Mangyongdae District's Songsan to Sopyongyang  Stations passing by Potonggang District's Kwangbok, Red and  (Kyongun) Streets. All of the streetcar's operative functions  and spare parts operated smoothly in accordance with the  technological demand. The streetcar moved swiftly and this made  the people happy.    By upholding the party's intention of developing the  country's transportation and freighting system, and providing  safer and more comfortable transportation conditions, the  workers of the Kim Chong-tae electric locomotive general  enterprise highly manifested the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude to make a new type streetcar and  underground electric railcar in just 70 days. They also  successfully guaranteed the trial run of the streetcar and  underground electric railcar.    The streetcar was manufactured and completed safely in  accordance with the topography of the capital and the passenger  demand. According to the automatic operation of the streetcar,  all the electric equipment and damping devices were operated  smoothly from the first trial run.    In particular, the efficiency of the starting apparatus,  made  by introducing the structural method of the electric circuit in  accordance with our country's situation, was very good. This  made it possible for the traction electric motor's starter to  move freely, and firmly guaranteed its operation's reliability  and safety.    The underground electric railcar also had a successful trial  run covering many blocks. All the elements including the  traction part, electronic equipment, damping device, and buffer  device operated normally.    In the vigorous road of the overall march of socialism of  our  own style, our heroic working class magnificently produced a  modern streetcar and underground electric railcar through their  own strength, technology, and material, and successfully  guaranteed the trial run. This has made the mass production of  the vehicles possible to develop the country's transportation  and freighting system. It is also of great significance because  it provides safer and more comfortable transportation conditions  and cultivated living conditions for the people.    The streetcar and underground electric railcar, which will  actively contribute to displaying the might of the country's  self-dependent national economy and developing the capital's  transportation and freighting, will soon go into mass production.

To approve the accompanying provisional statute on the  general principles of the administrative-territorial division  and organization of local self-government in the city of Moscow.    ""2. To propose to the organs of state authority of the city  of Moscow to develop and adopt normative acts in  January-February 1994 that regulate the procedure for conducting  reforms of local self-government in the city of Moscow.    ""3. To submit this edict for review by the Federal Assembly.    ""4. This edict goes into effect from the day it is  published.""    Statute on the General Principles of  Administrative-Territorial Division and Organization of Local  Self-Government in the City of Moscow:    I. General principles of administrative-territorial  division.    1. This provisional statute establishes the general  principles of the administrative-territorial division of the  city of Moscow as a component of the Russian Federation--a city  with federal significance.    2. The system of administrative-territorial division of the  city of Moscow is made up of:    --an administrative okrug;    --a municipal okrug.    3. The administrative okrug is an intracity administrative  unit, a system of organs of authority that is built on the basis  of centralized management. The procedure for managing the  administrative okrug is established by a special statute  approved by the mayor of Moscow.    The city of Zelenograd forms a separate administrative  okrug.    The territory of the administrative okrug includes municipal  rayons.    4. The municipal rayon is an administrative-territorial unit  of the city of Moscow within whose borders the self-government  of the population that lives on the given territory is conducted.    Municipal rayons are organized taking into account the  socioeconomic characteristics of pertinent territories, their  town-planning and historical features, and the presence of  residential complexes and objects of the municipal  infrastructure. The boundaries and the names of the municipal  rayons are established by the Moscow City Duma on a  representation of the mayor of the city of Moscow.    The municipal rayon is divided into microrayons  (settlements)  in which organs of territorial public self-government can be  established. The boundaries and names of microrayons are  determined by the organs of self-government of the municipal  rayon.    II. The principles of organization of local  self-government.    5. Local self-government on the territory of the city of  Moscow is conducted on the basis of this provisional statute,  legislation of the Russian Federation, and the normative acts of  the city of Moscow, taking into account its status as the  capital of the Russian Federation.    6. The organs of local self-government in the city of Moscow  are municipalities that include assemblies of representatives of  the population of the municipal rayon (municipal assemblies) and  the head of the local administration (head of the municipality).    III. Local administration.    7. The activity of the local administration is directed by  the head of the municipality, who carries out the management of  the municipal economy and property, develops the estimate of  incomes and expenditures, ensures its implementation, and  performs other executive-administrative functions.    8. The head of the municipality is appointed in coordination  with the municipal assembly by the mayor of Moscow from the  number of candidates recommended by the prefect of the  administrative okrug.    In the event of nonconcurrence by a majority of the members  of the municipal assembly in the candidacy proposed for the  position of the head of the municipality, the mayor has the  right to resubmit this candidacy or propose another one.    Given the nonconcurrence of a majority of the members of the  municipal assembly in the proposed candidacy in this case as  well, within a two-week period the mayor of Moscow appoints an  acting head of the municipality for a period of one year. The  indicated person enjoys all of the rights and carries all of the  responsibilities of the head of a municipality.    The head of the municipality cannot engage in other paid  activity, except for teaching, scientific, and other creative  activity.    9. The head of the municipality, in the event of a  systematic  nonfulfillment of his duties or their gross violation, can be  dismissed from the position by the mayor of Moscow, including on  a representation of the prefect of the administrative okrug, or  on the basis of an appeal by the municipal assembly. The  indicated appeal is examined by the mayor within a two-week  period.    10. The head of the municipality issues instructions on  questions of his own jurisdiction established by legislation of  the Russian Federation and normative acts of the city of Moscow.    11. The administration of the city and the municipal  assembly  have a right to exercise control over the activity of the head  of the municipality in a procedure stipulated by legislation of  the Russian Federation and normative acts of the city of Moscow.    12. The procedure for dismissal of the head of the  municipality and the appointment to the position and dismissal  from the position of his deputies is established by the mayor of  Moscow.    IV. Municipal assembly.    13. The assembly of representatives of the population of a  municipal rayon (municipal assembly) consists of five to seven  municipal councillors elected according to territorial election  okrugs for a period of two years on the basis of general equal  and direct elections in secret voting.    The procedure of elections to the municipal assembly and the  number of municipal councillors are established by the Moscow  City Duma on the recommendation of the mayor of Moscow.    14. The municipal assembly is convened by the head of the  municipality, who heads the municipal assembly, no less than  once a quarter to consider drafts of decisions proposed to him  on the following questions:    --approval of estimates of incomes and expenditures and a  report on their execution;    --approval of the annual program (plan) of socioeconomic  development and building of the territory and a review of the  report on its execution;    --approval of the procedure for managing municipal property;    --examination of other questions relating to the conduct of  the municipal assembly.    15. The municipal assembly can be convened at the initiative  of the Moscow City Duma, the mayor of Moscow, or by no less that  two-thirds of the municipal councillors, but not more than twice  a year.    16. The municipal assembly has the right to exercise control  functions, including control over the activity of the head of  the municipality and over the procedure for using tracts of land  and municipal property.    17. The municipal assembly is competent to make decisions if  more than half of the municipal councillors are present at its  meeting. Decisions are adopted by a majority of the municipal  councillors attending the meeting and are signed by the head of  the municipality, except decisions about appealing to the mayor  of Moscow on the question of dismissing the head of the  municipality from his position.    18. Decisions of the municipal assembly that are adopted  within the scope of its jurisdiction are obligatory for  implementation by all enterprises, institutions, organizations,  organs of public territorial self-government, and citizens  located on the pertinent territory.    In the event that a decision of the municipal assembly  contradicts legislation of the Russian Federation and normative  acts of the city of Moscow, or affects the interests of the city  as a whole, it can be suspended by the mayor of Moscow or  official authorized by him.    19. The municipal assembly can be dissolved by the Moscow  City Duma in cases established by legislation of the Russian  Federation, and also as a result of the conduct of a local  referendum on confidence in the assembly. The municipal assembly  can adopt a decision on early dissolution.    The elections of municipal councillors must be held not  later  than three months from the date of the corresponding adoption by  the Moscow City Duma of a decision on the dissolution of the  municipal assembly, the announcement of the results of a  referendum, or the adoption of a decision on self-dissolution.    V. Territorial Public Self-Government.    20. The population of microrayons (settlements), and also of  streets, blocks, and homes, can establish organs of territorial  public self-government acting in accordance with legislation of  the Russian Federation and the normative acts of the city of  Moscow.    21. The procedure for the formation of public  self-government  is established by the municipal assembly on a recommendation of  the head of the municipality in accordance with the standard  statute on organs of territorial public self-government approved  by the Moscow City Duma according to the written statement of  the mayor of Moscow.

The Islamic State of  Afghanistan, as the center of the gathering of real mojahedin,  is defending the results of the jihad. And the mojahedin  continue to sacrifice themselves in continuing their holy jihad  to eliminate the last remnants of the foreigners' hirelings like  the infamous Karmal-Dostam group. But Golboddin Hekmatyar, the  known wheeler-dealer of the period of jihad, has, in alliance  with Parcham and Khalq, the two factions of the Communist Party,  started a rebellion against the mojahedin of Afghanistan and the  Islamic State. Golboddin, on the one hand by his coalition with  the so-called National Movement, which is headed by  nation-seller Karmal, has embarked on the killing of the people  of Kabul. On the other hand with the atheist Tanay [exiled  former defense minister under Najibollah] he gathered around him  the band of Khalqis and instructed him to embark on the  establishment of the so-called peace movement outside  Afghanistan.    It is not without a reason that at the time of the attack by  Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam and on the occasion of the fifth  anniversary of the escape of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan,  once again the communist Shahnawaz Tanay raises his voice, and  in cooperation with Golboddin he expresses his opposition to all  jihadi leaders and Afghan mojahedin. This shows that to reach  his sinister goals, Golboddin is serving as an instrument for  the reunion of Khalqis and Parchamis. But for the mojahedin the  fifth anniversary of the escape of the Soviet occupier from  Afghanistan serves as a strong motive for the consolidation of  the jihad's trenches against the defeated communists of Khalq  and Parcham and their ill-nature. The heroic affirmative  response of all jihadi organizations to the holy jihad against  the Karmal-Dostam militia reflects this fact. The situation of  the country and the coordination of the jihadi organizations to  crush the Karmal-Dostum militia show that the mojahed Afghan  nation is determined to completely eliminate from the Islamic  State the twin movements of Tanay and Dostam on the sixth  anniversary of the escape of the Soviet forces. And Golboddin  who against the wishes of all mojahedin of the Hezb-e Eslami  [Islamic Party] has formed an unholy alliance with them will not  have a better fate than them.     "

Today, we want to observe this occasion at Mariana Grajales  Revolution Square in Guantanamo, at the foot of the monument to  the mother of the fatherland, an exemplary woman who wrote a  unique epic for her people with her life and that of her sons,  whom she fed with the milk of heroism.    What better square than this one, where Mariana calls on us  to kneel and swear to defend the liberty of the fatherland or to  die in the process, and where she orders us to stand and head  for the rebel encampment, as she did with all her sons, even the  youngest?    What better region than this, the heroic east, birthplace of  our revolutions: Guantanamo Province, where there is no beach,  path, valley, or mountain that does not deserve glorious mention  in our national history?    For the glorious deed of the Mambi rebels in last century's  three wars against the colonial yoke;    For the most tenacious and successful struggle by peasants  for land at Realengo 18 [20 degrees 18 minutes north 75 degrees  27 minutes west];    For the solid support it gave to our guerrilla columns to  found and expand the 2d Frank Pais Eastern Front by giving us  their better sons, giving us ammunition and all sorts of  supplies, surrounding us for nine months with their  uncompromising support until the 1 January triumph;    For its contribution to the Bay of Pigs victory. Perhaps not  enough has been said about the fact that the mercenaries sent to  land on the coast of Baracoa to open a front to divert us from  the main thust of the attack did not dare to set foot on  Guantanamo soil where a people, in arms, alert, and committed to  annihilate them, waited.    Faithful to their tradition of rising to the occasion in the  face of danger and adversity, the people of Guantanamo, under  government and party leadership headed by Comrade Juan Carlos  Robinson, faced with courage, energy, and efficiency the  devastating effects of the November floods. With the solidarity  of the entire nation and the support of the state, they quietly  made their repairs. Here, nature's catastrophe has served as an  incentive to work rather than as an excuse for failing to meet  production plans or defense tasks.    We are gathered here to promote 33 outstanding militiamen  and  reservists from this province who represent the 33 years that  separate us from the heroic Bay of Pigs and who represent all  those throughout the nation who are today receiving this well  deserved reward.    We are also gathered here to hand over replicas of Maximo  Gomez's glorious machete -- as in previous years -- to a group  of writers, journalists, artists, and cultural institutions on  behalf of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] in recognition of  their significant contributions to strengthening the nation's  combat capabilities and our people's patriotic and  internationalist awareness.    It is a great satisfaction, in keeping with the Council of  State decree, to reward the heroic fighters and civilian workers  of the border guard brigade who, in fulfilling their duties,  many times have risked their lives or been mutilated in the mine  fields bordering the territory illegally occupied by the United  States. On those who have fallen while carrying out this  dangerous mission -- First Lieutenant Arturo Ruiz Martinez and  soldiers Raul Milanes Labrada, Roberto Navarro Hernandez, and  Wilbert Vasquez Gamboa -- today we posthumously confer the  Antonio Maceo order.    They offered up their budding lives, these brave youths,  worthy followers of soldiers Ramon Lopez Pena and Luis Ramirez  Lopez, who decades ago lost their lives to treacherous bullets  fired from the other side of the fence. The sacrifice of those  who have been wounded or forever mutilated; the hard test of  thousands of soldiers and officers who, throughout the 30 years  of the existence of the border guard unit, have repeatedly  guarded the fatherland, risking danger and suffering the  pressures of the front line -- all this is part of the high  price we are forced to pay by the existence of that foreign  military base on a portion of our soil.    We have said and reiterated, from the very triumph of the  Revolution, that this base was imposed on the Cuban people by  force, and we demand that it be dismantled and returned to Cuba.  Its presence, in disregard of our people's manifest will and the  requests of their legitimate government, violates every norm of  international law. It is a brutal act of arrogance by the empire.    Today, from a military point of view, this base is obsolete  and constitutes an unnecessary expense that must be borne by the  U.S. taxpayer.    To reduce its uncontrollable military budget, the United  States has closed dozens of military bases in the United States  and abroad. Nevertheless, it maintains this one as a source of  constant provocation against and for the humiliation of Cuba.    We will never relinquish our sovereign right to that part of  our island, of our national territory.    We reiterate today what we said a little over a year ago in  this same square: There is not one day on which we are not  reminded that we have a dagger in our country's side, just a few  kilometers south of where we are now standing. We have never  lost the hope of someday removing this dagger in a peaceful and  civilized manner in accordance with the principles of  international law.    As everyone knows, our state's social system, as well as our  military doctrine, dictates that we will never become the  aggressor who fires the first shot.    Everything we do to strengthen our defense is precisely  directed toward making any aggression against Cuba so costly as  to make it a deterrent by making war prohibitively expensive and  illogical and, at the same time, toward securing our people's  peaceful and creative endeavors. For Cuba, avoiding war is  equivalent to achieving victory.    As long as we fail to achieve the legitimate and unwavering  aspiration of recovering the territory now occupied by this  base, our position is to avoid incidents along the line of  demarcation between this area and the rest of the island.    As we stated several weeks ago, last year and this: A  climate  of tranquillity has prevailed on both sides of the fence, and  our goal is to continue doing everything we can to maintain this  atmosphere.    This is the reason we have taken and will continue to take  every measure required to prevent any foolish endeavor on the  part of those who try to leave Cuba by this route.    To try to cross the densely mined field on both sides of the  fence, attempting to evade our checkpoints and patrols, is  madness and, at the same time, an act of provocation against  Cuba's security.    Two armies are deployed face to face on either side of the  fence. Given the United States' permanent hostility toward our  nation and its illegal occupation of this part of Cuba, these  two armies are not precisely friendly armies.    It is evident that such illegal departure attempts, the  crossing of the demarcation line, could result in incidents of  war of unpredictable consequences.    If it were the will of the U.S. Government, it would prevent  those attempts, once and for all, by declaring that the illegal  entry of Cubans wishing to emigrate to the United States will  not be tolerated. It could also prevent the tragic deaths of  those who drown in the Florida Straits in their attempts to  reach U.S. shores on frail rafts or vessels by not welcoming as  heroes the so- called raft people [balseros] or automatically  giving them the residence status not extended to any other  foreigner in the United States. However, we know U.S.  immigration policy with regard to the Cuban people is to deny  the majority of the visa requests presented to the U.S.  Interests Section in Havana, in order to encourage those illegal  and dangerous departures and thereby deliberately boost the  smear campaign against Cuba. This policy is very contradictory  when contrasted to that for Haitians in Caribbean waters, or  Mexicans, or Central Americans at the Mexican border. It is so  cynical as to be indefensible. Sooner or later, it will have to  be changed.    We are opening our doors wider every day so that anyone who  wants to try his luck in a capitalist regime can do so through  normal and legal means. We have always believed, and the  commander in chief has said many times in the last 30 years,  that socialism is a social system that can be built only through  voluntary efforts, with awareness.    Ours is, precisely, a system radically different and  opposed to capitalism. Our creed is to eliminate the  exploitation of men by men and to give men true liberty and  human status. Therefore, for those who dislike socialism and  prefer capitalism -- in the belief that in that system, where  men prey on men, they can gnash their way up and fulfill their  personal ambitions -- we are not blocking the departure of  selfish persons, who think in that way, to any capitalist  country of their choosing.    I have said that we will do everything in our power to  maintain a situation of normalcy and calm at the line of  demarcation. We will therefore prevent, by every possible means,  attempts to leave Cuba through that dangerous military area.    In order to make this policy viable, the courts have begun  strict implementation of our laws against those arrested for  trying illegally to reach the naval base and who are therefore  committing an extremely grave crime by endangering national  security.    It is fitting to remember the nonpenal treatment issued by  the authorities in most of these cases where the persons had no  previous record, and the generous release that made it possible  for some of them to try again.    We warn those who may try to emigrate by this means not to  run the fatal mistake of choosing to do so. This carries not  only the risk of a court trial, but also the more ominous risk  of death or mutilation from a mine exploding on either side of  the demarcation line.    With the same passion that with we request the return of  that  part of our territory occupied by the naval base, we are aware  that the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers who  guard the border in rotation are not directly responsible for  this usurpation of our sovereignty. We are not moved by any  feelings of personal hate against those soldiers who have been  sent by their government to fulfill such a disgraceful mission.  Even less could we harbor any animosity against their families,  spouses and children, who are part of the American population  living on base.    If the United States were to unleash a war against Cuba, no  matter under what pretext, we would wage a no-holds-barred fight  against the enemy in whatever corner of Cuba they may be. The  Guantanamo Naval Base would, of course, be no exception. In this  territory, we have, as we said here last year, everything needed  to neutralize this enemy enclave. [applause]    In this case, as long as the aggression does not originate  in  this region of Guantanamo and the lapsed time is not used to  reinforce the naval base, we are willing to allow the necessary  time to evacuate civilians -- the spouses and children of the  personnel stationed there -- from the base.    The Mambi army and their worthy heirs, the rebel army, have  never tainted their weapons by attacking women, children, the  defenseless elderly. The FAR will not do this either, for it  cherishes the military honor and humane traditions of its  predecessors.    Our historic legacy is to fight fiercely for the  independence  of the fatherland, under highly disadvantageous conditions,  against the enemy; to take their weapons; to respect prisoners  of war; and to help injured prisoners.    As Marti said of Mariana Grajales: Was she not steadfast  during the entire war, surrounded by her children? Did she not  encourage her compatriots to fight? And later treat the injured,  Cuban or Spanish?    This is how Cuban revolutionaries from every period act.    We are proud that never, in Cuba, has a prisoner been  tortured or mistreated; nor is there a single missing person,  thousands of whom are still being sought by Latin American women  and grandmothers.    Comrades, our people feel gratitude and admiration toward  their brave sons, the members of the border guard unit. The FAR  are proud of the valor, dedication, and discipline of this unit  deployed on the front line.    By presenting the Antonio Maceo order today to Brigadier  General Jose Solar Hernandez, who for over a decade led this  region with exemplary dedication and efficiency, we render  homage to his personal performance and work, the high level of  readiness, and the high morale attained by the force of which  the border guard is part.    This order is also granted to Major Jose Alvarez Beliz,  chief  of the engineer battalion, who on more that 20 occasions has  entered the mine fields and whose most recent act of courage was  the rescue of [soldier Elmis] Brooks [Chivas], where he was also  injured.    Luckily, his injuries were not serious, and he was able to  retrieve his injured comrade from the mine field.    By bestowing this order on Lieutenant Elmis Brooks Chivas,  we  are acknowledging not only his personal courage, demonstrated in  many highly dangerous acts, but also the deep human sensitivity  that moved him to risk his life, a plethora of virtues, to  rescue the vacuous lives of a group of dumbbells, as generously  described by comrade Elmis. With this award we are also exalting  his decision to rejoin his beloved unit and the risky job of  combat engineer. Young men like Brooks, who come from the most  humble sectors of our people and are forged by the Revolution,  strengthen our belief that the next generation is ready.  [applause]    In addition to the Antonio Maceo order to which I have  referred, the Calixto Garcia medal for valor is presented to 13  other comrades: several officers, noncommissioned officers,  soldiers, and one FAR civilian worker. Most of them have been  mutilated or injured. All of them have on numerous occasions  performed heroic acts. Two-thirds of them are still in active  military service in this brigade or other units.    To all the comrades awarded today: We reiterate our  gratitude  and most heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the FAR and  relay to you a warm embrace and salute from the commander in  chief. [applause]    To those who gave their lives for the fatherland and  nurtured  with their noble blood the undefeatable land defended by the  Guantanamo forces, we dip our combat flags and swear before  Mariana that we will be ever deserving followers of her example;  and before her we shout, louder than ever: Viva Free Cuba!  [Crowd: Viva!] [applause]     "

At about 1200 on 14 April 1994, approximately 150  Greek soldiers not only approached the official Albanian border  in the Kakavije region but, after being deployed on the terrace  of a Greek border post building, carried out surveillance of  Albanian territory using a camera. At 1300 they withdrew deep  into their own country.    After the 10 April massacre, this action is another  provocative act leading to a further aggravation of tension and  military pressure by the Greek side on the Albanian border.  This provocative act runs counter to the norms of good faith  defined in international acts that regulate the good neighborly  relations between states.    We were also informed that at 1030 today, about 2 miles into  our territorial waters, at latitude 40 degrees and longitude 19  degrees 41 minutes, one of our naval patrol boats in Borshi Bay  detained a Greek fishing vessel, the Aios Vasilis, captained by  Petro Xharka, for violating Albanian laws by carrying out  unlicensed fishing in Albanian waters.    In conformity with the rules and legal procedures, this ship  was accompanied to the port of Sarande and was handed over to  the relevant authorities for further action.    At 1125 today a Greek military patrol vessel was detected  approaching the Greek fishing boat detained by our naval patrol  boat. At 1130 this Greek warship stopped at latitude 39 degrees  38 minutes and longitude 19 degrees 43.5 minutes, about 20.5  miles into our waters.    Considering that the Greek warship violated Albanian rules,  our patrol boat requested that the warship left Albanian waters  immediately. At first the Greek P-52 vessel refused to accept  that it was in Albanian waters. However, later, at about 1230,  the warship left for Greek waters, where it remained until 1320.    This incursion and stay of the Greek patrol boat is another  provocative action that may cause extremely grave consequences.  Our navy is seriously committed to defending legality and  sovereignty in our territorial waters.    Under these conditions, the Defense Ministry of the Republic  of Albania asks the relevant authorities of the Greek Army to  prevent and avoid such military actions that incite and increase  tension on the official border of the Republic of Albania and  further aggravate interstate relations that may lead to  dangerous consequences.

ACTION:     Proposed rule.                 SUMMARY:     This proposed rule would provide a comprehensive revision of the acts prohibited on the National Forest System enforced by personnel of the Forest Service. These proposed revisions respond to emerging law enforcement issues, the enactment of new laws, and the promulgation of new rules that have occurred since the subject rules were last revised. The intent of these rules is to adequately protect National Forest System resources, the public who uses the National Forest System, and the employees who administer it.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       Law Enforcement Activities on the National Forest System      Promulgation of Rules            In order to carry out the agency's statutory mission, it has long been necessary to promulgate rules setting forth those acts that are prohibited on the National Forest System. These rules are integral to Forest Service efforts to protect resources, facilities, employees, and the public. The primary authority for the Secretary to promulgate such rules is found at 16 U.S.C. 551. Violators of these rules can be punished by imprisonment for a term not to exceed six months and are subject to a range of fines as a result of the enactment of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (18 U.S.C. 3559, 3571).      Jurisdiction of National Forests          Both Federal and State laws apply to the national forests (16 U.S.C. 480), that is, both Federal and State criminal and civil jurisdiction apply to persons within the national forests. Generally, State enforce State laws, while Federal officers enforce Federal laws and regulations. In most cases, the Forest Service enforces laws and regulations relating to its resource protection responsibilities. Some prohibitions established in certain State laws may also be appropriate subjects of Federal regulation. There are several Forest Service prohibited acts that rely on the existence of a particular State law for definition, for example, 36 CFR 261.13(i) prohibits the operation of any vehicle off Forest Development, State or County roads ``in violation of State law established for vehicles used off roads.'' Thus, in some instances, an act or omission by a national forest visitor may be regulated by both Federal and State governments.    Forest officers cooperate fully with State, local, and other Federal agencies in executing their responsibilities related to the National Forest System. With the enactment of the Cooperative Law Enforcement Act in 1971 (16 U.S.C. 551a), the Forest Service has entered into reimbursable agreements with some State and local agencies (usually a county sheriff's office) for the protection of persons and their property on the National Forest System where the existence of forest attractions and facilities account for an extraordinary amount of visitor use. These agreements provide an avenue to assist local jurisdictions that are impacted by these attractions. During the past several years, however, it has become evident that reimbursement through the Cooperative Law Enforcement program cannot alone provide the level of protection that should be afforded the public in Forest Service recreation areas. For example, when a forest visitor is victimized by theft of personal property or an assault and the local enforcement authority is unable to respond, there are often trained and equipped Forest Service law enforcement personnel in the immediate area at the time of the incident. These victims are often assisted by Forest officers who initiated what action they can, given the current scope of the prohibitions.

Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun are accused of robbery and  murder in the boat-fire tragedy which claimed the lives of 24  Taiwan tourists and eight mainland crew, at Qiandao Lake, a  major tourist attraction in Hangzhou city.    A deputy chief procurator from the Hangzhou People's  Procuratorate opened the proceedings against the three accused.    He told the court that the three accused seized large  quantities of other people's property by threatening them with  violence and then murdered their victims by blowing up the boat  and setting fire to it to cover up the crime.    The indictment said that the acts of the accused were in  violation of article 150 and article 132 of the criminal law of  the People's Republic of China.    The indictment described the case as very serious and very  harmful to society.    It said that there was enough evidence to prove the criminal  acts of the accused. The three accused committed the crimes  jointly and the sentence should be for all the crimes combined.    The court was composed of one presiding judge and two other  judges. The case for the prosecution is being put by three  public prosecutors, and the accused have lawyers to defend for  them.    The public hearing, under the regulations of China's  criminal  procedural law, will consist of a court investigation, court  arguments, final pleadings of the accused, court verdict,  followed by sentence.    Court decisions will be reached after thorough investigation  and verification to make sure that the accused have been proved  to be the perpetrators of the crimes.    The court must also decide the nature and seriousness of the  crime and what the appropriate punishment should be.    The 200-seat court was crowded with members of the public  this morning, including local residents, relatives of the  victims, Taiwan businessmen and representatives of a Taiwan  travel agency.    About 60 reporters from China's mainland, Hong Kong and  Taiwan followed the entire hearing via a special closed-circuit  TV in a room set aside for this in the court building.     "

A Russian Foreign Ministry statement said today that Russia  has made efforts in carrying out the initiative of lifting the  siege of Sarajevo and putting the city under the United Nations  control.    ""We have been seeking and are still seeking the  implementation of this initiative by acting openly within the  framework of U.N. Security Council resolutions,"" the statement  said. ""We continue this line now, despite the serious  aggravation of the situation around Sarajevo for well-known  reasons.""    On February 5, a motar attack on a crowded market center in  Sarajevo, the capital of the warring Bosnia-Herzegovina, killed  at least 68 citizens and injured over 200. Four days later, the  NATO issued an ultimatum threatening to impose air strikes on  positions around the city. The ultimatum expires on Sunday [20  February].    The statement said that Bosnian Serbs had adopted a decision  to withdraw their heavy guns from around Sarajevo in reply to  the demand of the U.N. Security Council.    ""We hope that this expression of goodwill by one of the  warring factions at the critical moment for the settlement (of  the conflict) will be followed by concrete actions,"" said the  statement.    It said: ""We are calling on the (Muslim-led) Bosnian  Government to hand over its heavy guns around Sarajevo under  U.N. control without delay, as envisaged by the U.N.  secretary-general's plan proposed in his letter to the Security  Council on February 10.""    The statement also called on the United States and the  European Union nations to exert, in the spirit of their  statements preferring a political solution of the problem, the  necessary influence on the Bosnian Government to make it  cooperate with the United Nations in reaching full deblocking  and demilitarization of Sarajevo.    ""At this crucial time it is extremely important to rule out  the possibility of any provocation and acts of sabotage of this  peace process,"" the statement stressed.    It also said after lifting the siege of Sarajevo the U.N.  Security Council could immediately start considering ways to  establish U.N. administrative rule in the city, as well as  measures to strengthen other safe heavens on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.

He said:    A deputy spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of France  released a provocative ""statement"" on February 3, claiming that  there had been no success in the DPRK-U.S. talks and it was time  to bring up the issue of taking ""sanctions"" against the DPRK at  the United Nations Security Council.    At a time when a serious crisis has been created in the  situation of the Korean peninsula by a perfidious act of the  United States, France freely cried for ""sanctions"" against the  DPRK, though she must know well what such ""sanctions"" would  mean. This was not aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation  but at finding a pretext for resuming its nuclear tests by  taking issue with the DPRK's ""nuclear problem.""    Lurking behind this impudent act of France is also her  sinister intention to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, egg the United  States on to a showdown with the DPRK and cause a military  conflict in the Northeast Asian region including the Korean  peninsula so that it may fish in troubled waters through the  massive sale of weapons of destruction. This is clearly proven  by the fact that France has sold large quantities of weapons to  this region including South Korea in recent years.    It is until some time ago that France sold a big amount of  plutonium to Japan, not joining the nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty [NPT] on the pretext of ""modernization of nuclear  deterrent."" It is unbecoming to her to express ""concern"" over  the fate of the NPT now.    It is really the height of sarcasm for France, which  possesses many nuclear weapons and now feels an urge to continue  nuclear tests, to cry for ""sanctions"" against the DPRK, charging  it with the ""nuclear problem"".    We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the  France  authorities, ignoring our sincere efforts for a fundamental  solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, are  resorting to bellicose acts against us.    If France persist in such insidious acts without discretion,  we will take necessary measures against them.    France must look squarely at the situation and ponder on the  matter.     "

During the  discussion, he pointed out: The PLA should set an example and  spur on the masses in building spiritual civilization and thus  make due contributions to social stability and promoting the  building of socialist spiritual civilization.    When a deputy from the Guangzhou Military Region, which is  situated in the forward place of reform and opening up, and a  deputy from the army unit served by Xu Honggang, a heroic  fighter ready to take up the cudgels for a just cause, talked  about how the troops should do something in building spiritual  civilization, Liu Huaqing said: General Secretary Jiang Zemin  called on the PLA to set a good example in building socialist  spiritual civilization. What should they do to set a good  example? In my view, it is first necessary to understand this  is an important responsibility entrusted to the people's army by  the party and the people in the new historical period and is the  great expectations of the masses of the people. All officers and  men in our Army should understand the importance of taking the  lead in doing a good job of building spiritual civilization and  consciously cultivate this habit, starting bit by bit from  ourselves. If the Army does a good job in building spiritual  civilization, a soldier will become a propagandist or an model  who can play an active, promoting role in building spiritual  civilization. Xu Honggang is just such a model.    Speaking on the need for the troops to set a good example in  developing good social conduct, Liu pointed out: Unhealthy  practices and evil phenomena should be resisted and held in  check. We should be concerned about the weal and woe of the  masses, do more good work for them, help them solve  difficulties, and help the masses in garrison areas get rid of  poverty and become rich. When the interests, life, and property  of the masses are harmed, servicemen should step forward bravely  and take up the cudgels so that the people can see hope from the  fine image of the troops and heighten their confidence.

They emphasized this massacre was the result  of an organized, premeditated, and planned act. This is proven  by the mass killings and acts of violence which continued after  this terrible massacre at the hands of the Israeli occupation  troops in several areas of the occupied territories.    In a statement issued today, the popular organizations and  trade unions said this abominable crime is not new to the  aggressive nature of the Israeli settlers and soldiers. This  crime was intended to terrorize Arab residents as a prelude to  evacuating and annexing Arab land as part of the Israeli policy  of expansion and hegemony.    The statement noted Israel's racist rancor and terrorist  record, which is replete with mass massacres, including the  massacres of Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Kafr Qasim, Bahr al-Baqar,  Da'il, and southern Lebanon. The statement added that the  Hebron massacre confirms the dangers posed by continued Israeli  occupation of Arab territories and the presence of settlements  in them. Both the occupation and settlements violate all  international laws, norms, and resolutions.    The statement emphasized that this heinous massacre shows  that Israel's intransigence and procrastination in the peace  talks instigate acts of violence. This makes Israel responsible  for extremism and terrorism in the region.    The statement reiterated that the Syrian people,  organizations, and trade unions support the Palestinian Arab  people and our kinsfolk in the Golan and southern Lebanon in  their struggle to liberate every inch of Arab territory and to  regain the Palestinian people's legitimate rights.    The statement added that the popular organizations and trade  unions -- which were established under the sponsorship and care  of leader struggler Hafiz al-Asad and which are experienced in  adherence to rights as their policy and in sticking to  consistent positions as their principle -- stress that the path  of capitulation, sellout of rights, and chasing the mirage of  partial and deceptive solutions cannot produce peace.    The statement urged the international community, the  Security  Council, and the United Nations to end the policy of double  standards and assume their humanitarian responsibility to  confront the logic of Israeli hegemony. It urged these bodies  to pressure Israel into complying with international legitimacy,  which specifies the principles of a just and comprehensive peace  and guarantees security in the region.     "

0,FT932-9569 ,"FT932-9569 _AN-DEMB5ADCFT 930513   FT  13 MAY 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Collective panic will not help      By SAMUEL BRITTAN   The great British historian, Thomas Macaulay, knew 'of no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one of its periodical fits of morality'. There is, however, one almost as ridiculous: the Tories in one of their fits of collective panic. The near hysteria with which many MPs, ministers and, above all, the Tory media, have reacted to the shock government by-election and local election defeats in mid-parliament, were to be predicted. But the phenomenon is all too familiar. Unfortunately, my memory goes back to the losses of Torrington and Orpington to the Liberals under Harold Macmillan. Such results tell us nothing about the result of the next election. Forecasting the next election is as unreliable an activity as forecasting the timing of economic 'green shoots'. How far do economic factors explain what has happened? Not nearly as much as supposed. Various indicators have been tried to explain government popularity. All have succumbed to Goodhart's Law; as soon as a measure is used as a policy target, it lets us down. The least unpromising is real personal disposable income because it is comprehensive, taking in benefits as well as pay, and allows for taxes and inflation. It has proved remarkably steady in the medium term. The average annual increase has fluctuated at about 2 1/2 to 3 per cent - from which between a  1/4 and  1/2 per cent should be deducted to get disposable income per capita. Straight-laced economists have often regarded these increases as too high, because they have not left enough over for investment and exports. Nevertheless, when real personal income growth has been much below these rates it has tended to bounce back, while much higher increases have proved unsustainable. The achievement of relatively high rates of growth of this variable has never been a sufficient condition of government re-election. The first Wilson government was defeated in 1970 in spite of an above-trend increase in its last full year of office. The Heath government was defeated in 1974 in spite of an extraordinarily high increase of 6.4 per cent in its own last year, and an average of 5 per cent over its whole term. Lord Callaghan was defeated in 1979 in spite of an even more extraordinary growth rate of 7.7 per cent in real incomes in 1978. One is tempted to say that a reasonably good growth of real income is not a sufficient, but a necessary, condition of re-election. Even this comes up against the fact that John Major was re-elected last year in spite of a  1/2 per cent fall in disposable incomes in the recession year of 1991. A mechanical analysis might say that the present prime minister benefited from the achievement of the normal 2 1/2 per cent a year average real income growth over the 1987-92 parliament. But it is more realistic to suggest that he benefited both from distrust of Labour and the widespread feeling that there had already been a change of government when he took over from Lady Thatcher. At any rate a recovery to 2 1/4 per cent in disposable income growth in 1992 - well ahead of general economic recovery - did not prevent the political losses of a week ago. There is one negative feature of which one can be confident: the futility of cliche populist reactions such as a cabinet reshuffle or replacing the chancellor. The problems remain the same; the officials analysing them remain the same. There is just Whitehall gossip about the new occupant, whether he reads his briefs, rewrites speeches and so on. The odds are that a new chancellor - after an initial period of tough-sounding reassurance of the financial markets - would be more tempted than Norman Lamont to make gestures in the direction of cheap money and plenty of it, and avoiding the fiscal changes required to eliminate the structural budget deficit. The present chancellor has everything to gain and nothing to lose from sticking to sound money policies. The time for a symbolic change at No 11 has gone. None of this means that we should pass over in silence the handling of Britain's membership of, and departure from, the exchange rate mechanism - which remains abysmal, whether one was a supporter or an opponent of membership. Incompetence by one's own side is less forgivable than incompetence by the other. Nor is it made more tolerable if one shared as a bystander in some of the mistakes. But simply putting a new face in the Treasury would achieve less than nothing. What is needed is a public inquiry into the full chain of events, covering prime minister as well as chancellor, officials as well as ministers, Bank of England as well as Treasury. Any inquiry would have to go back at least to the choice of entry parity in 1990 without properly consulting the German authorities; the failure to rethink the parity when a combination of events made it less appropriate; the ignoring of the warning signals given by the divergence indicator - when the government refused either to raise interest rates or to realign; the conduct of the notorious Bath finance ministers' meeting; the failure of communication with the Bundesbank in the days before Black Wednesday last September; and the official surprise at the extent of the run on sterling in a foreign exchange market with a daily turnover running into hundreds of billions. A model might be the Franks Committee investigation of the events leading up to the seizure of the Falklands in 1982. Although this had anodyne conclusions, the narrative was revealing and accepted by both opponents and supporters of the Falklands war. Meanwhile, the biggest obstacle to the improvement of UK economic policy is the failure of free-market and sound money Conservatives to understand the arguments for institutional reform and for more use of rules rather than government discretion. This was a cause central to Friedrich Hayek, who died just over a year ago and whom such leaders claim to revere. (The proceedings of a conference held to commemorate the first anniversary of Hayek's death will be published by Macmillan in spring 1994. S F Frowen (ed) Hayek: The Economist and Social Philosopher; A Critical Retrospective.) At a recent lunch I heard the go-go New Zealand finance minister Ruth Richardson take legitimate pride in a 1 per cent inflation rate - the lowest in the OECD, and which was at last being accompanied by healthy growth. She did not fail to pay tribute to one of her Labour predecessors, Sir Roger Douglas, for establishing the independent Reserve Bank, which had made this achievement possible. A British cabinet minister was present, one of the few with untarnished reputation. Instead of inquiring further how an independent central bank can fit into a British-type parliamentary democracy, he just asked why it was necessary if the government displayed enough will-power. How can one begin on the fallacies in this simple question? Who knows where this minister will be in a year or two, and whether his will is going to prevail or not? Heroic acts of will-power are an unreliable, and even undesirable, basis for constitutional democracy. All the great exponents of limited government, from John Locke to the founders of the US Constitution and onwards, have called for institutions which will do least damage when manned by people of common-or-garden ability and morality. The point about an independent central bank is not that its governors are better or cleverer or more heroic than parliamentarians, but that, given the right constitution or contract, they have every incentive to achieve stable prices. Parliamentarians rightly have a multiplicity of objectives and time horizons. The quality of Conservative thinking was better in the 1970s - when reacting to Labour in office - than today, when the leaders squabble about which of them are to be the masters.

A squad leader in a communications company in the Jinan  Military Region, Xu Honggang bravely stepped forward and fought  heroically against four odious thugs armed with knives at a  critical time when people's lives and property were in serious  danger. Even while suffering from 14 knife wounds, he still  jumped off a long-distance bus and chased the thugs until he  fainted. With a heroic deed of not fearing evil and being ready  to take up the cudgels for a just cause, he has set a good  example for us to follow.    What is equally praiseworthy, while Xu Honggang was  suffering  from serious wounds for the sake of the masses, some comrades in  Junlian County Taxation Bureau, including Zhan Benfang, together  with cadres and masses from Junlian, Yibin, and Shengchi, spared  no effort to save him. In saving this hero, cherishing love for  this hero, and emulating this hero, they performed a great deal  of touching deeds causing the song of justice written by this  hero to reverberate louder and louder. All this not only  suggests that at a time when we are carrying out reform and  opening up and establishing the socialist market economic  structure, the fine tradition of the Army loving the people and  the people supporting the Army is still thriving across Chinese  soil; this all the more indicates that the virtue of being ready  to take up the cudgel for a just cause has been inherited by  most Chinese descendants.    The report RENMIN RIBAO publishes today relates in detail Xu  Honggang's deeds of bravely fighting for a just cause. Frankly  speaking, the present situation in social order is not quite  satisfactory. In broad daylight, some law breakers have made  trouble and endangered the people's lives and property as well  as social tranquility. Sometimes, some people are not willing  to save others from danger. China's reform, opening up, and  modernization are in a crucial period. There must be a fine  social environment for the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure and the materialization of the second-step  strategic objective. Thus we are required to learn from Xu  Honggang, cultivate a social mood of taking pride in and  respecting the spirit of fighting for a just cause, and  encourage more people to combat bad deeds and bad people so that  the millions will work hard for the people's tranquility and  social stability.

One thing we can do is reconsider the wisdom of Executive Order 12333, signed  in 1975, which absolutely bars agencies of the U.S. government from ordering  the killing of specific foreign individuals.    In other words, no matter how many acts of terrorism are ordered by leaders of  the Medellin drug cartel or any other terrorists around the world, they can  rest secure in the knowledge that their lives are safe from American reprisals  or preemptive strikes.    The threat of narco-terrorism is quite unlike any we've confronted because of  the unprecedented combination of greed, evil and money. It is a volatile  mixture that has yielded deadly results. Look at the toll in Colombia: 70  judges killed in this decade, along with dozens of journalists, hundreds of  police and a leading candidate for that country's presidency. And look at the  toll in America: thousands of lives -- often the youngest and most vulnerable  among us -- ended or permanently damaged by the drugs these cartels ship to our  shores.    Unlike terrorists based in the Middle East or Europe, narco-terrorists have a  criminal infrastructure in place in America -- hundreds of drug traffickers in  virtually every city and region of the country -- ready to respond to their  commands. In 1987, the murder of Drug Enforcement Administration informant  Barry Seal in Louisiana was believed to be on the orders of the cartel.    Narco-terrorists have the will and the means to attack not just innocent  civilians, but the very institutions that form the foundation of our society.  In that sense, they are more than lawbreakers. They are a threat to our  national security.    We cannot officially declare war against a group that has no diplomatic status  as a country. But we should respond to their behavior as if we were at war.  Placed in the context of such a conflict, Executive Order 12333 is an  unnecessary and unwise restriction on the President's power to defend against a  terrorist threat.    When confronted by such a threat, the President should have the widest array of  options available to him. It does not make sense to wage war against terrorists  with one hand tied behind our back. Nor does it make sense to telegraph to our  enemies what tactics we have already ruled out by law.    Some will say that such a change in our policy would be immoral. I disagree. Is  it more moral to let a terrorist carry out an attack that kills innocent  civilians when the only thing preventing us from stopping him is an executive  order? Is it more moral for us to launch a bombing raid on an area in which  terrorists live, thereby threaten ing the lives of innocent civilians, because  a covert mission targeted to those same terrorists cannot be authorized under  our laws?    The occasions on which a President would find cause to order a strike against a  terrorist would be limited. We should continue to attempt to prevent terrorist  acts and bring terrorists to justice through normal channels, if possible. But  Executive Order 12333 should be revised to account for those cases in which  force is the only means we have to prevent a tragic attack against us. To  safeguard against abuse, such action should be taken only with the approval of  the President and the leadership of Congress and the intelligence committees,  as is done now for other covert operations.    Changing Executive Order 12333 should not be seen as a panacea, but making  terrorists susceptible to direct attack would signal the seriousness with which  we view their acts and hopefully make them more hesitant to act against us.    As it stands, Executive Order 12333 represents a safe haven for  narco-terrorists.

0,FT943-4040 ,"FT943-4040 _AN-EIKACAD9FT 940910   FT  10 SEP 94 / The windmills of your mind: The Nature of Things      By ANDREW DERRINGTON   What is it about drugs that allow them to alter the workings of the mind, manipulating moods and perceptions, lifting depression, even enhancing memory? According to neuroscientists, these mental phenomena result from the electrical activity in the circuits of the neural computer between our ears. How then, do drugs cause selective changes in the activity in these circuits? What gives the neural computer its chemical dimension? These questions have been thrown into sharp relief by the reported deaths of night club revellers, thought to be caused by the drug Ecstasy. And although neuroscientists can answer them, and can even explain why Ecstasy has such dangerous side-effects, it is still impossible to predict either the efficacy or the side- effects of new drugs. The chemical dimension of neural activity starts from the fact that the electrical currents in neurones (nerve cells) are carried not by electrons, as in a computer, but by ions (electrically charged particles produced when salts dissolve in water). Ions carry electric current much less efficiently than electrons because they are bigger and heavier, but they have the advantage that ionic currents can be switched on and off by chemical switches. The brain compensates for the inefficiency of ions as current carriers by using the same technique as modern communication engineers, digital transmission. Information is coded and transmitted by neurones in the form of a stream of identical pulses, called action potentials. Action potentials are electrical pulses controlled by chemical switches. The chemical switches are operated by changes in voltage (voltage-gated). The action potential travels down a neurone by operating the voltage-gated switches just ahead of it, and 'switching on' an action potential there, which then repeats the process. This is exactly the way that relays enable man-made cables to transmit long distances without losing signal strength. Drugs that impair the actions of the switches can suppress the transmission of information. This is how some nerve poisons, such as tetrodotoxin which is secreted by the Japanese puffer fish, and anaesthetics work. Any drug that acts on the voltage-gated switches that control the action potential will affect the whole brain. To affect our moods a drug must modulate the activity of different brain circuits selectively. It must act on a process that works differently in brain circuits controlling different functions. The synapse, which is the device that transmits information between neurones, is a promising target for selective drug action. When an action potential arrives at a synapse, it releases a minute quantity of a chemical called a neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter acts on the next cell in the chain by reacting with a special molecule, a receptor, to operate a chemical switch and turn an ionic current on or off. There are many different neurotransmitters, and each may act on several different types of receptor. Different brain circuits differ in the transmitters they use. The same transmitter may also differ from circuit to circuit. This gives drug designers an opportunity to devise chemicals that will have very specific effects on the brain. Chemicals that influence the interactions of neurotransmitters with their receptors, for example by altering the amount of transmitter released or the duration of its interaction with the receptor, have the potential to alter the operation of specific brain circuits. This is the way drugs alter the workings of the mind. Drugs can also affect the function of other brain circuits, and of cells throughout the whole body, causing side-effects. Unfortunately there is much, not only about transmitters, receptors and brain circuitry, but also about general physiology that is not understood. It is impossible to predict the effect of new drugs either on the body or on the brain. Potential drugs still have to be identified by trial and error, and rigorously tested for safety. Ecstasy is the classic case of a drug with a wide range of effects. It acts by suddenly increasing the release of the neurotransmitter Serotonin, which is used by neurones in circuits controlling mood, particularly reactions to unpleasant stimuli. Serotonin is also associated with the brain circuits that control body temperature, and those that select which of the millions of sensory signals available at any one time we attend to. Ecstasy's popularity as a dance drug stems partly from its effect on mood, but also from the fact that serotonin shuts out unpleasant sensory signals caused by thirst and high body temperature. It enables people to dance until they collapse from heatstroke. Tragically, this effect of serotonin is compounded by the way it acts outside the brain. It causes massive and widespread blood-clotting, which could be fatal even in people not suffering from heatstroke. Thus Ecstasy (3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which was originally patented for use as an appetite suppressant, is an object-lesson in the difficulties that face the pharmaceutical industry in their search for new drugs.

Previn himself frequently performed on the concerts as pianist,  making chamber music an important if not often acknowledged part of his  presence in the community.    Monday the fall series of Philharmonic Chamber Music Society concerts began at  Gindi Auditorium of the University of Judaism, and there was Previn. There were  not a lot of musicians on the stage, or a lot of pieces on the program, but it  proved a surprisingly well-chosen offering.    The music of Brahms is probably not generally considered a Previn specialty,  although if the matter be considered, a number a strong Previn-led Brahms  performances come quickly to mind. On this occasion, Previn, violinists Camille  Avellano and Elizabeth Baker, and cellist Gloria Lum, turned to the First  Violin Sonata and First Piano Trio.    In the ""Regenlied"" Sonata, Avellano displayed a technical security and warmth  of sound that contradicted her generally cautious interpretation. There was  much simplicity and sincerity in her playing, but not the emotional blossom the  piece requires for maximum effect.    Avellano and Previn collaborated easily, in a reading of straightforward  phrasing. Previn's supportive efforts were compromised by a Bosendorfer that  sounded overly bright and twangy in the lively Gindi acoustic. That was most  unflatteringly apparent in the heavily buzzing bass at the beginning of the  Adagio, the movement that had the most obvious mechanical lapses but also the  least inhibited music making.    The Opus 8 Trio -- even in Brahms' late, compacted revision -- is a work of  symphonic scope, expansively built and heroic to perform. Baker, Lum and Previn  approached it with a firm sense of overall direction which did not preclude,  but rather capitalized on, attention to detail.    The outer movements became serious compilations of collective and individual  bravado, initiated by Lum's fervent, big-boned opening solo. At first, Baker's  smooth playing threatened to become lost in the sonic heat -- the Bosendorfer  lid was fully raised for the Trio, as it was not for the Sonata -- but balances  were eventually righted.    It was in the Adagio though, that the three musicians found the expressive core  of the work. The nuance of articulation and varieties of timbre and color  seemed almost limitless, but there was nothing self-indulgent about their  application. The playing was finely meshed, in transparent textures.    The Finale ended unfortunately, with a technically stammered passage from  Baker. It did nothing to undermine the nobility of the achievement, however.

The Commission solicited comments on the Rule as part of the agency's periodic review of rules and guides. Having considered all of the issues raised during the comment period, the Commission is amending the Rule. These amendments add the metric equivalents for measurements stated in inches in the examples used in the Rule, and clarify some of the illustrations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:    I. Introduction        The Commission has determined, as part of its oversight responsibilities, to review rules and guides periodically. These reviews seek information about the costs and benefits of the Commission's rules and guides and their regulatory and economic impact. The information obtained assists the Commission in identifying rules and guides that warrant modification or recision. On April 19, 1993, the Commission published in the     Federal Register     a request for public comments on its Trade Regulation Rule on Deceptive Advertising as to Sizes of Viewable Pictures Shown by Television Receiving Sets, 16 CFR part 410 (``The Picture Tube Rule'' or ``The Rule'').    This Rule, like the other trade regulation rules issued by the Commission, ``define[s] with specificity acts or practices which are unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Such rules may include requirements prescribed for the purpose of preventing such acts or practices. A violation of a rule shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of section 5(a)(1) of (the Federal Trade Commission Act), unless the Commission otherwise expressly provides in its rule.'' 16 CFR 1.8. The Commission may initiate a trade regulation rule proceeding ``upon its own initiative or pursuant to written petition filed with the Secretary by any interested person stating reasonable grounds therefor,'' 16 CFR 1.9.        II. The Regulation        The Picture Tube Rule sets forth the appropriate means for disclosing the method by which the dimensions of television screens are measured, when the measurement is included in any advertisement or promotional material for the television set. Under the Rule, the method used to measure the size of a television screen must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in close proximity to the size designation. However, the Rule provides a safe harbor for measurements based on the horizontal dimensions, which may be given without disclosing that the dimensions were measured horizontally. The Rule notes that the measurement must not take into account any curvature of the tube. Further, disclosing the method of measurement in a footnote rather than in the body of the ad does not constitute a disclosure in close proximity to the size designation.    The Rule includes examples of both proper and improper representations of size descriptions. Previously, these examples were expressed in terms of inches. Under Executive Order 12770 of July 25, 1991 (56 FR 35801), and the Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, (15 U.S.C. 205) all federal agencies are required to use the SI metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants and other business-related activities (which include rulemakings), except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms. To comply with these provisions, the examples in the Rule have been altered to include the metric equivalent in parentheses beside the English measurements. Thus, the measurements in the examples have been revised to read: 15 inches (38.10 cm); 19 inches (48.26 cm); 20 inches (50.80 cm); 21 inches (53.34 cm); and 262 square inches (1,690.32 sq. cm). This is a technical amendment to an illustrative example in the Rule rather than a substantive amendment to the Rule. It is not intended to create any new requirement under the Rule to use metric measurements or to use them in any particular fashion (for example, in hundredths of centimeters). A new note has been added to the Rule providing that the metric measurements are included for information purposes only, and are not required to be included in any of the disclosures.

General Principles of Administrative-Territorial Division    1. This Provisional Statute establishes the general  principles of administrative-territorial division of the city of  Moscow as an entity of the Russian Federation and city of  federal status.    2. The system of administrative-territorial division of the  city of Moscow is formed by:    the administrative okrug;    the municipal rayon.    3. The administrative okrug is an intracity administrative  unit whose system of organs of power is structured on the basis  of centralized government. The procedure for government of the  administrative okrug is established by a special statute  approved by the mayor of Moscow.    The city of Zelenograd forms a separate administrative  okrug.    The territory of the administrative okrug encompasses  municipal rayons.    4. A municipal rayon is an administrative-territorial unit  of  the city of Moscow within whose boundaries self-government of  the populace residing in the given territory is effected.    Municipal rayons are formed taking into account the  socioeconomic features of the applicable territories, their  city-planning and historical characteristics, and the presence  of residential buildings and facilities of municipal  infrastructure. The borders and designations of municipal rayons  are established by the Moscow City Duma upon recommendation of  the mayor of the city of Moscow.    A municipal rayon is divided into microrayons (settlements)  in which organs of territorial public self-government may be  created. The borders and designations of microrayons are  determined by the organs of local self-government of the  municipal rayon.    II. Principles of the Organization of Local Self-Government    5. Local self-government in the territory of the city of  Moscow is effected on the basis of this Provisional Statute,  legislation of the Russian Federation, and normative acts of the  city of Moscow, taking into account its status as the capital of  the Russian Federation.    6. The organs of local self-government in the city of Moscow  are the municipalities, encompassing assemblies of  representatives of the populace of a municipal rayon (municipal  assemblies) and the head of the local administration (head of  the municipality).    III. Local Administration    7. The activity of a local administration is directed by the  head of the municipality, who manages the municipal economy and  property, develops an estimate of income and expenditures,  ensures compliance with this estimate, and performs other  executive and administrative functions.    8. The head of a municipality is appointed by the mayor of  Moscow, upon coordination with the municipal assembly, from  among a field of candidates recommended by the prefect of the  administrative okrug.    In the event a majority of the members of the municipal  assembly fail to agree with the candidacy presented for the  position of head of municipality, the mayor has the right to  present this candidacy again or to present another candidacy.    If the above takes place, upon failure of a majority of the  members of the municipal assembly to agree with the candidacy  presented, the mayor appoints an acting head of municipality  within two weeks for a term of office of one year. The  individual so appointed enjoys all the rights and bears all the  responsibilities of head of the municipality.    A head of municipality may not engage in other paid  activity,  except for instructor, scientific, scholarly, or other creative  activity.    9. In the event of systematic failure to fulfill his  responsibilities or gross violation of these, the head of a  municipality may be discharged from his position by the mayor of  Moscow, including upon recommendation of the prefect of the  administrative okrug or based upon an appeal of the municipal  assembly adopted by two-thirds of the assembly members. The  aforementioned appeal is examined by the mayor within two weeks.    10. The head of a municipality issues directives on matters  within his competence as established by Russian Federation  legislation and normative acts of the city of Moscow.    11. The city administration and municipal assembly have the  right to supervise the activity of a head of municipality  according to procedure as envisaged by Russian Federation  legislation and normative acts of the city of Moscow.    12. The procedure for discharging a head of municipality  from  his position and of appointing and discharging his deputies from  their positions is determined by the mayor of Moscow.    IV. The Municipal Assembly    13. The assembly of representatives of the populace of a  municipal rayon (municipal assembly) consists of from five to  seven municipal councilmen elected from territorial electoral  districts for a term of two years, on the basis of universal,  equal, and direct elections under secret ballot.    The procedure for elections to the municipal assembly and  the  number of municipal councilmen are determined by the Moscow City  Duma upon recommendation of the mayor of Moscow.    14. The municipal assembly is convened by the head of the  municipality, who presides over the municipal assembly no less  frequently than once per quarter, in order to examine draft  resolutions he has proposed on the following issues:    confirmation of the estimate of income and expenditures and  the estimate compliance report;    confirmation of the annual program (plan) for socioeconomic  development and housing construction for the territory, and  examination of the report on its implementation;    confirmation of the procedure for management of municipal  property;    examination of other issues related to the jurisdiction of  the municipal assembly.    15. A municipal assembly may be convened upon the initiative  of Moscow City Duma, the mayor of Moscow, or a minimum of  two-thirds of the municipal councilmen, but not more than twice  per year.    16. A municipal assembly has the right to exercise  supervisory functions, including supervision of the activity of  the head of the municipality and procedure for the utilization  of land parcels and municipal property.    17. The municipal assembly is authorized to adopt  resolutions  when more than half of the municipal councilmen are present at  its session. Resolutions are adopted by a majority vote of the  municipal councilmen present at a session and are signed by the  head of the municipality, except for resolutions regarding an  appeal to the mayor of Moscow on a question of discharging a  head of municipality from his position.    18. Resolutions of a municipal assembly adopted within the  framework of its competence are subject to mandatory execution  on the part of all enterprises, institutions, organizations,  organs of public territorial self-government, and citizens  located in the territory in question.    In the event a resolution of a municipal assembly  contradicts  Russian Federation legislation or normative acts of the city of  Moscow, or affects the interests of the city as a whole, it may  be suspended by the mayor of Moscow or by a responsible official  appointed by him.    19. A municipal assembly may be dissolved by the Moscow City  Duma in instances stipulated by Russian Federation legislation,  and also as the result of conduct of a local referendum on  confidence in the assembly. A municipal assembly may adopt a  resolution on early self-dissolution.    The election of municipal councilmen must be held not later  than three months from the date of adoption of the appropriate  Moscow City Duma resolution on dissolution of the municipal  assembly, announcement of the results of referendum, or adoption  of a decision on self-dissolution.    V. Territorial Community Self-Government    20. The populace of microrayons (settlements), as well as of  streets, blocks, and residential buildings, may establish organs  of territorial community self-government which operate in  accordance with Russian Federation legislation and normative  acts of the city of Moscow.    21. Procedure for the formation of organs of community  self-government is established by the municipal assembly upon  recommendation of the head of municipality, in accordance with  the model statute on organs of territorial community  self-government approved by the Moscow City Duma upon  recommendation of the mayor of Moscow.    VI. Transition Provisions    22. The time frames and phases of the conduct of reform of  local self-government in the city of Moscow are established by  the Moscow City Duma upon recommendation of the mayor of Moscow.    23. Prior to adoption of the Charter of the City of Moscow,  particular features of the management of municipal property,  including procedure for transferring such property to the  jurisdiction of municipal rayons and associations in the  interest of residents of the entire city or individual parts of  the city, are established by the Moscow City Duma upon  recommendation of the mayor of Moscow.    24. Prior to adoption of the Charter of the City of Moscow,  procedure for formation of the estimate of income and  expenditures of municipal rayons is established by the Moscow  City Duma upon recommendation of the mayor of Moscow. Prior to  the creation of conditions necessary for the formation and  implementation of local budgets, formation and implementation of  a unified city budget is permitted, with allocation of financial  resources to the municipal rayons.

""These countries through extensive financial, propaganda and  political backing support a grouplet which is involved in the  bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) [peace be upon  him],"" the president said addressing the inaugural session of  the nationwide seminar on ""judicairy week.""    ""Such countries provide the MKO with money, radio station,  office and diplomatic passports and support the manifestation of  terrorism and also open their gates to them,"" noted Hojjat  ol-Eslam Rafsanjani.    The seminar is held annually to commemorate martyr Beheshti,  the first chief justice in the post-revolution, who was  assassinated by the MKO terrorists.    The president stressed: ""We attach no importance to those  countries and place no hope in them. However, we can offer the  world the best type of human rights based on Islam and Islamic  laws.""    Referring to the progress made in the country, the president  stressed that the enemies are not totally disappointed and would  resort to vicious acts such as bomb blast at the holy shrine  which could please no obstinate individual.    ""We know our enemies and understand that the hostility and  grudge they have harbored against the revolution is not because  of individuals. They are scared of the Islamic movement and of  the final triumph of Islam,"" he noted.    He called on all people to preserve their vigilance in all  dimensions, adding that they should also be prepared to face  more vicious propaganda because the enemies increase their  brutal acts as the country progresses.    Praising the martyrs of the Islamic republic, especially  martyr Beheshti, the president said that some 13 years ago when  masterminds behind the bombing of the Islamic republic party's  headquarters were hatching the plot, they were vainly thinking  that through the bombing the Islamic republic would collapse and  the way would be paved for the establishment of the type of  government they were seeking for.    The president pointed to the achievements of the country in  many fields and said that the Islamic system, by passing through  ""arduous defiles"" has now reached a path rather easier to pass.    Chief justice Mohammad Yazdi, Justice Minister Hojjat  ol-Eslam Shushtari and judges from throughout the country were  present at the gathering.     "

In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Ortega noted actions carried  out by Nicaraguans in 1993 in support of their Cuban brothers,  stressing the importance of these actions in light of existing  poverty in that Central American country.    Amid poverty that affects 70 percent of the population, with  more than six of 10 citizens unemployed and suffering the  effects of the neoliberal policy of the Violeta Barrios  government for the past three years, our people generously  showed their solidarity, Ortega said.    He added that people from the humblest neighborhoods and  towns, patients who received free medical treatment in Cuba,  professionals and technicians trained in that contry, and  relatives of others now in Cuba on scholarship participated in  the campaigns to collect milk and food for the children and  people of that heroic Caribbean nation.    In addition, he said, thousands who have never been to Cuba  but who completely identify with the people of Jose Marti also  participated.    As an organization, the Sandinist National Liberation Front  (FSLN) actively participated in these efforts, guiding its  militants and followers to strengthen the solidarity committees  in all departments and permanently condemning the blockade on  Cuba at all international forums.    Ortega added that in its relations with the Nicaraguan  Government, the FSLN obtained from President Barrios official  support for transferring the collected food and has always  insisted on the need to maintain normal diplomatic relations  with Havana, despite pressures.    During the past three years, he stressed, there have been  campaigns to have Nicaragua break relations with Cuba and  withdraw its embassy in that country. In countering those  campaigns, the FSLN has maintained a permanent struggle with the  government -- although in silence, understandably -- to prevent  our country from participating in the isolation of the island.    In Central America, Ortega stressed, the FSLN carried out  actions in 1993 to counter U.S. pressures to have the Cuban  issue included in presidential summit agendas.    Ortega said that after the signing of the Salvadoran peace  agreements Washington should contribute to detente in Latin  America by lifting the blockade of the Cuban revolution, which  is the desire of most nations as expressed during the past two  UN General Assemblies.

Anthony Hope's novel is the most glorious trash ever written; you can snicker at Georgette Heyer but woe betide the smart Alec who thinks himself above The Prisoner of Zenda  -not to mention the sequel, Rupert of Hentzau. The best that can be said for this Greenwich staging is that it is a tolerable introduction to the joys of Zenda, and is surely excellent seasonal fare for office parties composed of people who have not read the original. And, since I was in a post-works-outing glow myself, I enjoyed myself a fair deal. Lez Brotherston has designed an ideal set, with crossbridges and staircases and walls that summon up all the various perilous locales. Mark Lockyer has much of the right dark daredevil allure for Rupert of Hentzau, and Melanie Jessop is as commanding and glamorous as Antoinette de Mauban should be. But Hope's novel and the Ronald Colman movie are both dear to my heart, and I incline to purism in Zenda matters. Matthew Francis's adaptation and staging not only hang fire, but they also encourage both players and audience to chuckle at the contrivances of this Ruritanian romance. The intoxicating story keeps tipping over into camp; and this is hard to forgive. As the two Rudolphs, David Haig lacks both virile beauty and heroic ardour; and what is The Prisoner of Zenda without those? Leonie Mellinger, a talented actress, underplays the nobility and high romance of the Princess Flavia. Nicholas Gecks is too mild for Black Michael (I found myself missing Raymond Massey in this role more than anyone from the 1937 Selznick movie). The production will undoubtedly improve in due course; injury robbed us of the swashbuckling we had been hoping for. But not only more swordfighting is needed. More seriousness is required too.

After the artillery shelling of the coastal city of Sidon,  Zionist planes raided several areas in the south. Dozens of  civilians were killed or wounded and a large number of houses  were destroyed in the raids and the shelling.    Despite these recent acts of aggression, which once again  turned world attention to the developments in southern Lebanon  and to the brutal Zionist policies there, Washington, in a  public, biased step toward the usurper entity, called on the  Lebanese Government to bring the situation under control. The  U.S. Administration's message to the Lebanese Government  yesterday, Friday, said Lebanon must take the necessary measures  to calm the situation in the south and put an end to violence  there.    This, naturally, is not the first time Washington has  adopted  such a biased position in favor of Israel, despite all its  flagrant violations of international law and its blatant  aggression against Lebanon. Over the past 10 years Washington  has persisted in its illegitimate support for Israel's  occupation. The Zionist forces are occupying hundreds of square  meters of Lebanese territory, deploying thousands of Zionist  soldiers and officers in that area, which Israel calls a  security belt. But this is not all: Tel Aviv has repeatedly  invaded Lebanese territory, and its aggression has reached the  Lebanese capital itself.    The continuation of these acts of aggression deprive the  Lebanese people of security and stability. Nevertheless, the  United States insists on its support for this aggressor and  usurper entity. Not only did the United States fail to condemn  the Israeli aggression, but it also asked the Lebanese  Government to apply effective pressure on the Islamic resistance  movement in south Lebanon, the movement that fights the Zionist  occupation from inside Lebanese territory.    The United States, which gave several warnings to the  Lebanese Government on this subject, forgot that the  international public knows that self-defense is a right of any  nation under foreign occupation. International laws give the  Lebanese people the right to defend their land. These laws  condemn Israel and its aggressive and expansionist policies.  Israel is still disregarding Security Council Resolution 425  some 15 years after it was issued; the resolution says Israel  must withdraw from the occupied Lebanese territories.     "

Addressing the congregation, which embraced a large group of  mourners and pilgrims from various parts of the country and the  world to the blessed shrine of His Eminence Imam Khomeyni,  Ayatollah Yazdi said that taking part in ceremonies marking the  anniversary of the Imam's demise has become an Islamic ritual.  [passage omitted]    The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran referred to the  recent guidelines of his eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the  leader of the Islamic revolution, which stated that the nation,  the government, and the country's officials should refrain from  doing things which could serve to inspire hope among the  enemies.    Ayatollah Yazdi urged the nation to pay careful attention to  these guidelines, and said: Those who speak in certain forums  and gatherings in a very unfair way and away from the norm of  constructive criticism, and tend to deny all the achievements of  the Islamic revolution and overlook all the great tasks which  have been accomplished since the victory of the Islamic  revolution -- in particular during the era of reconstruction --  are in fact creating a gap in the ranks of the nation, thereby  undermining the nation's unity and enabling the enemy to exert  its influence.    Ayatollah Yazdi then condemned the slogan of separation of  religion from politics and, calling on the clergy and all the  strata of the nation, said: We must move in such a way that our  policy remains identical to our religion.    Furthermore, he condemned the Zionist regime's kidnapping of  Mustafa al-Dirani, the head of the Believers' Resistance  Movement of Lebanon, as well as Israel's air attack on the  Ba'lbek area in southern Lebanon. He considered these acts to  be a blatant violation of international norms and conventions  concerning the territorial integrity and independence of a  country. He, moreover, condemned the silence of international  forums toward these crimes, and said: These acts of the Zionist  regime show that until the people of the occupied territories  return to their homeland, and until Israel is completely  destroyed, the Mideast region cannot hope to witness peace and  tranquillity.

Following the forced  entry into the Belgian Embassy, other groups of Cubans  separately entered into the German Embassy and the Chilean  Consulate, but in none of these cases have Cuban authorities  allowed the perpetrators of these illegal acts to leave the  country.    A recent statement issued by the Cuban Foreign Ministry was  explicit enough to make potential violators give up their goal  of violating the norms that regulate diplomatic sites worldwide.    This is not the first time groups have tried to use  embassies  or ambassador's residences as springboards for their immediate  exit from Cuba because they believe that the fanfare of the act  itself and the political character they want to give it will  ease the way.    The Cuban authorities' position has always been to firmly  deny such demands. In these new cases, as on previous occasions,  the Cuban authorities have insisted that people who commit such  crimes may return to their homes without facing charges,  although the perpetrators will not be exempt from punishment for  previous crimes or for crimes committed during the forced entry  into a diplomatic site.    The previously mentioned Cuban Foreign Ministry statement  was  even more dynamic in confirming that anyone who enters a  diplomatic site by force will never be authorized to leave the  country, even if they later abandon the site. By stating  clearly that people involved in such acts permanently lose the  right to leave the country, the Cuban Government has taken the  necessary steps to better protect embassies which, it seems,  have become the target of individuals who would like to leave  the island through this ill-suited path without being  politically persecuted.    As Belgian, German, and Chilean diplomats have seen, the  people they are harboring are not the object of political  persecution. Moreover, it is very clear that these individuals  are additions to a long list of Cubans who want to emigrate to  the United States, but the U.S. Interests Section in Havana  continues to grant visas with an eyedropper, denying visas to  most of applicants.    With the Foreign Ministry's recent statement, Cuba has  stressed its traditional policy of not giving in to pressure  exerted by people who purport to emigrate by illegal and even  violent means.

Graber, Graber is a research biologist with the National Park  Service. He began his Park Service career while a student at Berkeley and  obtained his Ph.D. studying the bears of Yosemite.      In the last weeks of its first century, Yosemite National Park captured the  nation's attention with great fires. It will be tragic irony if these  lightning-generated pyrotechnics, as natural to the Sierra Nevada as waterfalls  and granite, deflect our thoughts from the real, man-made threats facing one of  America's most beloved places.    A visit to Yosemite Valley this year will overwhelm you with souvenir tributes  to the park's centennial. Alfred Runte's dark history stands in stark contrast:  His celebratory effort broods over the past century's battles between the  forces of vision and those of exploitation. Runte calls himself an  ""environmental historian."" Author of ""National Parks: The American Experience""  (1979), this academic-without-portfolio offers a free-wheeling, controversial  and scholarly critique of Yosemite's first 100 years.    The official touchstones of Yosemite's history are its discovery by whites and  the rapid extirpation of the native Ahwahneechees led by Tenaya in the mid-19th  Century; the Yosemite Park Act of 1864 establishing a protected reserve of the  Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias; its expansion and full-fledged  establishment as a national park in 1890; John Muir's heroic but failed  campaign to save Hetch-Hetchy Valley from damming in 1913, and lastly the  establishment of the National Park Service in 1916. But although he  acknowledges these historical markers, Runte is after subtler, and ultimately  more important, game.    ""Among all of the debates affecting America's national parks, the most enduring  -- and most intense -- is where to draw the line between preservation and use.""  Runte's first sentence signals his anthem. His improbable heroes are a line of  scientists tracing their heritage to Joseph Grinnell of the University of  California's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology in Berkeley.    In Runte's eyes, these men -- beginning with Grinnell himself in the early days  of the national park -- saw Yosemite as a great reserve of wild nature, a  source of scientific information and understanding. They used reason to  campaign patiently for what we today would call the ""wilderness ecosystem""  model of a national park. ""And so to Berkeley professors, students and alumni  went the honor of founding Yosemite's 'university of the wilderness.' From its  graduates, Grinnell now looked forward to the evolution of a new public  consciousness of the importance of national parks as refuges for biological  diversity.""    Runte's villains are an even longer line of despoilers and developers who saw  money to be made in Yosemite and largely accomplished their mission. Their  progenitors were the first to build hotels and plant orchards to service  Yosemite's pioneer visitors in the 1860s, and fought tirelessly to maintain and  expand their claims on park land. Runte sees an unbroken line of concessioners  leading to the mighty Yosemite Park and Curry Co., Yosemite's sole proprietor  of bed, drink and lodging, today a wholly owned subsidiary of the Music Corp.  of America (MCA). Runte hyperventilates between his lines when he reports  Edward C. Hardy, president of the Curry Co., calling Yosemite a ""destination  resort.""    And just where does the National Park Service and its predecessor stewards of  Yosemite fit in Runte's scenario? They are the largely unimaginative pawns of  politics, conservation's eunuchs, seeking always for compromise drawn from the  seemingly contradictory aims of the National Park Service Act: ""to conserve the  scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to  provide the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will  leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.""    Every compromise, finds Runte, has taken Yosemite further from its wild  beginnings. Referring to Horace Albright, the Park Service's co-founder: ""Park  Service tradition, Albright confirmed, leaned heavily toward public works . . .  in Albright's estimation, development was a given and therefore became a basis  for comparison instead of an object properly targeted for exclusion. . . . The  point he refused to acknowledge was that development itself, whether modern or  crude, perhaps should never have been allowed inside Yosemite National Park.""  Runte effectively uses a long, detailed section on the history of bear  management in Yosemite to illustrate how natural resources have suffered,  rather than inconvenience visitors or proprietors.    There is, oddly enough, a minor fourth element in ""The Embattled Wilderness"" --  park visitors. In the grand play between preservationists and developers, both  of whom claim to be serving some public, the Park Service ineffectually acting  as umpire, Runte's grandstands are largely silent. In truth, none of the  principals in this heroic drama can claim to represent the real wishes of  Yosemite's millions of annual visitors, or the values of its 200 million  owners.    The park concessioners, Curry Co. back through its predecessors, have had no  trouble filling their rooms, bars, restaurants, and tour buses, nor selling  their trinkets. There is more than a year's wait for room reservations as I  write this -- surely, by some standards, an argument for more accommodations.  On the other hand, when the Park Service queried its public in the 1970s for a  revision of its General Management Plan, it found strong sentiment for  de-urbanizing Yosemite Valley, for the reduction of structures and services.    As an ecologist, I am pleased by Runte's focus on natural resources, and the  long relationship between UC Berkeley's field biologists and the evolving  management of Yosemite. True enough, Joseph Grinnell, Joe Dixon, George Wright  and A. Starker Leopold exhausted half a century trying to instill the notion of  a wild biotic reserve upon the Park Service. Equally true, Yosemite's waters  still are befouled by introduced trout; its bears still trapped and sometimes  killed to pay for visitors' sins; its forests deflected from their ancient  rhythms by the need to protect people and their possessions from fire. Yet the  words of Yosemite's ecological sages have -- however belatedly -- largely found  their way into contemporary policy and practice.    Runte makes a relentless case that overcrowded, overprostituted Yosemite must  be rationed; therefore why not reduce its amenities, and in so doing reduce the  attraction to those who seek pleasures that can be purchased elsewhere?    In his tough treatment, Runte conveniently ignores the larger world in which  Yosemite National Park must function and always has functioned. It is a social  and a political construct; it and its stewards always have reflected the  context of their times. Grinnell and his students weren't merely ahead of the  Park Service; as academics they were free to be visionaries and properly  outraced social values.    Today, Yosemite faces new perils that Runte fails to address: air pollution  attacking its ecosystems; development on its boundaries making it a biological  island; political limits on the fires its forests demand, and the likelihood  that climate change may yet destroy the nearly intact ecosystem painfully  conserved thus far.    Without the best scientific effort and intense social commitment, Yosemite will  not survive its second century.

During his meeting with RSK President Milan Martic and its  Prime Minister-designate Borisav Mikelic in Belgrade, Milosevic  underscored that negotiations were the only right way of  resolving the crisis in former Yugoslavia, it has been reported.  In this context, Milosevic said an overall normalization of  Serb- Croat relations was of utmost importance for peace and  stability in the region.    On March 30, the Republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia signed  at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb an agreement on the cessation  of hostilities, which took effect on April 4. The  Krajina-Croatian conflict broke out in 1991 because of Croatia's  forcible secession from former Yugoslavia and its decision to  downgrade Serbs to a national minority, after which the Serbs  proclaimed the Republic of Serb Krajina in their ethnic and  historical lands. The Republic of Serb Krajina has been a U.N.  protected area (UNPA) since March 1992.    The Serbian president pointed out the danger coming from  certain extremists who were working against interests of the  Serb people, and, in this context, mentioned the activity of  some members of the Serbian Radical Party, an opposition party  in the parliaments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its  federal unit, Serbia, and of irresponsible groups and  individuals in the RSK. ""Extremists compensating for their moral  and political defeat in Serbia by behaving in a barbarous way in  Krajina are a serious threat to Krajina's interests,"" he said.    The Serbian Radical Party, headed by Vojislav Seselj and  headquartered in Belgrade, maintains a very strong branch in the  RSK. Last autumn, Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia -- which  is the biggest party in Serbia and Yugoslavia -- bitterly  criticized the Serbian Radical Party for its fascist ideas,  raising paramilitary units and committing crimes in war zones in  former Yugoslavia. He said it was necessary as soon as possible  to push to the margin the extremist forces in the RSK and put  them under control of the RSK authorities, whereas legal  proceedings should be instituted against individuals who had  broken the law and sunk deep in crime.    Serbs, who are proud of their heroic past, must not allow  extremists and criminals to strip them of their honour -- the  Serbian president underscored. Martic and Mikelic advised  Milosevic of their efforts aimed at peace and at stabilizing the  RSK politically and economically.     "

He has left for Moscow, his  secretary replied on the telephone. But to all appearances  member of the Government, Minister N. Travkin, appointed on the  eve of the holidays by Russian presidential edict, still does  not have a working position in the capital. Just try finding a  brand-new member of the government when you do not know what  range of issues he has actually been put in charge of. Maybe,  with his Hero of Socialist Labor medal, he is in charge of  construction? Or maybe, knowing that he is closely associated  with Stanislav Govorukhin, he is in charge of the fight against  corruption?    A polite tenor voice over the telephone from the president's  press service passed me on to his government colleagues:  ""Travkin has been appointed one of their number, after all.""  There were no further explanations.    At the government press service a surprised female voice  replied: ""What, has he actually been appointed?"" On the off  chance, I phoned around several more numbers of the service  whose name anyway indicates absolutely clear tasks -- the public  relations department. It is staggering that no one could tell  me anything sensible. In my search for Minister N. Travkin in  the vast ""White House"" labyrinths I resolved to perform an  almost heroic act and phoned the office of Government Apparatus  Leader V. Kvasov. His assistant promised to help me collect the  necessary information. Alas, after exactly one hour I was  handed on yet again -- to Sergey Surov, deputy section chief at  the government press center.    ""It was not the government apparatus that prepared the  edict.  What is more, it says that Travkin has been appointed a member  of the government but certainly not a minister. We have no  comment to make,"" S. Surov replied.    [Sizyy] ""Is this appointment a surprise to you?""    [Surov] ""Let's say yes. But I do not believe that the  matter is closed yet. I think that you could get some kind of  explanation from the president's staff,"" S. Surov said, bidding  me good-bye.    People are now saying that Nikolay Travkin is the first  minister without portfolio in modern Russian government history.  And that his appointment has a direct connection with the  Democratic Party of Russia leader's signing of the agreement on  national accord. Meaning that the Russian Government is becoming  a government of ""those in accord.""     "

Today is marked as the day  of solidarity with Azerbaijani people around the world. On this  symbolic day, I congratulate all the Azerbaijanis in the world  and wish stronger solidarity among them in the future.    The year 1993 was painful and problematic for Azerbaijan and  its people. [words indistinct], a part of our republic's  territory was occupied as a result of Armenia's aggression, and  our fellow countrymen and kinsmen were forced to leave their  places of birth and become refugees in 1993. Azerbaijan  experienced a serious economic and social crisis. Our republic  has successfully emerged from all those difficulties and  problems and has confidently entered 1994.    The confrontation among individual forces, the harm done to  Azerbaijan by the separatist forces, and the [word indistinct]  disrupted social and political stability in our republic and  brought Azerbaijan to the verge of civil war in mid-1993. The  threat of civil war has been averted, but bloodshed occurred and  that state of affairs created a very tense situation in the  republic.    Thanks to our people's awareness, bloodshed was prevented  [as  heard], the threat of civil war was averted, the confrontation  was eliminated, and the separatist forces that tried to fragment  our republic were rendered ineffective. Consequently, our  republic has been able to resolve its problems in an atmosphere  of peace and stability.    Azerbaijan tried to obstruct Armenia's aggression and the  armed attacks by Armenians in 1993. Regrettably, we have  suffered several defeats and lost part of our territory. Many  of our citizens were forced to become refugees in their homeland  as a result of the occupation of our territory by the Armenian  military forces. More than a million refugees have been  resettled in the other parts of Azerbaijan. That has had a very  serious effect on the general situation in the Republic,  particularly the internal situation. However, it must be noted  that the situation has changed.    Changes have taken place as a result of the establishment  and  organization of the Republic's Armed Forces and the work carried  out to successfully defend Azerbaijan's territory. Our military  forces and our struggling young men are heroically defending our  territory and successfully retaliating against the enemy  attacks. They are dealing blows to the enemy. It can be  pointed out that all the attacks launched by the Armenian Armed  Forces over the last few months have been rebuffed. Our  republic's military forces have defended the positions they  hold. In fact, they have shown how strong Azerbaijan's defenses  have become.    Bloody fighting is taking place on all battlefronts, and the  Armenian Armed Forces are to blame for the clashes.    We wish to reiterate that Azerbaijan wants a peaceful end to  the war, which has caused a calamity for our republic. In fact,  our republic has taken several steps in that direction, and we  want to reiterate our position at the present time.  Regrettably, our republic's initiatives have failed to yield a  result.    Nevertheless, Azerbaijan is now able to strengthen its  military will. I wish to assure our people that our armed  forces will take the necessary measures to successfully defend  our republic and retrieve our occupied territory.    A war is being fought. Casualties are being inflicted on our  people. The heroic sons of the Republic's people have been  martyred in the battlefronts while defending our territory. I  want to take this opportunity to extend condolences to the  families and parents of all our martyrs. I bow my head in  acknowledgment of their heroic effort. God bless the souls of  the martyrs. May their graves be filled with bliss and may God  give patience to their families.    I am convinced that our people are now able to successfully  resolve the serious problems that exist now.    I want to convey my greetings to our officers and men who  are  bravely fighting at the battlefronts and to all our people on  this festive day. I congratulate them on the occasion of the  New Year and wish them good health and success in performing  their sacred duties.    The war is continuing. The number of refugees has  increased as a result of the Armenian military attacks. I  sincerely congratulate the refugees and all the people on the  occasion of the New Year. Yes, it is a tradition in our  republic that our citizens mark the New Year in their homes.  Regrettably, many of our citizens have lost their homes and  their parents. They have sought shelter in various places. The  people and the state respect them, wherever they are. I pray  that they maintain high spirits and morale.    A serious crisis exists in Azerbaijan. The economic and  social crisis has been caused by nearly six years of fighting  and certain objective and subjective reasons. This state of  affairs has reduced the standard of living. Our people are  living in a difficult situation, but we are aware that our  people are [word indistinct] and will resolve the existing  problems. They will leave the painful and problematic year  behind. Changes will occur in our economy in 1994, and the  standard of living will improve day by day.    Today is the day of solidarity for the Azerbaijanis. I wish  for strong solidarity to exist among all the Azerbaijanis.  Solidarity must be established among all the Azerbaijani people  in the world, particularly those who live in independent  Azerbaijan.    Two years have passed since Azerbaijan declared its  independence. We are now moving into the third year. We have  significant tasks to perform. A state of strong solidarity  among Azerbaijan's people is necessary for the realization of  these tasks. We can contribute toward solidarity among the  Azerbaijanis in the world if we establish real solidarity among  the Azerbaijani people in our republic. In view of that, I urge  our people to unite and establish solidarity. I also wish to  assure our people that 1994 will [words indistinct].    I want to reiterate that we are defending our homeland's  territory. We are working to end the war in Azerbaijan. We are  working to improve the current situation. We have taken several  steps in that direction, and we shall continue to do so. On  behalf of Azerbaijan's people, I signed the Paris Charter in  France on 20 December. This reaffirmed to the world that  Azerbaijan is committed to peace, tranquillity, and security.  However, we shall continue to strengthen our defense forces and  make an effort to retake our occupied territory. Our people can  rest assured that all the necessary measures will be taken to  maintain our republic's territorial integrity and prevent the  violation of our borders.    I want to assure our esteemed countrymen that our territory  will be liberated, regardless of what may happen in 1994. The  refugees will return to their homes, and Azerbaijan's  territorial integrity and state structure will be maintained.    I congratulate you again on the occasion of the New Year,  and  I wish all the Republic's citizens peace, security, happiness,  and success. Happy New Year.     "

A section-by-section discussion of the changes proposed to each part follows.      Part 261_Prohibitions      Subpart A of this part sets forth acts and omissions that are prohibited throughout the National Forest System. Subpart B grants authority to Regional Foresters and Forest Supervisors to issue orders and regulations prohibiting certain acts in specific areas.      Subpart A_General Prohibitions      Section 261.1Scope      This section establishes when the prohibitions of the subpart apply. The punctuation in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) would be revised to make clear that the conditions set forth in 261.1(a) are in the alternative (i.e. that all conditions need not apply, just any one of them).  Paragraph (a)(3) currently provides that the rules of the subpart apply to an act or omission that affects, threatens, or endangers persons using the National Forest System or Forest development roads or trails or persons engaged in the protection, maintenance, or administration of such. As written, the rule protects Forest Service employees only when they are engaged in their duties and does not apply to situations where Forest Service employees are threatened or intimidated during ``off-duty'' hours as a result of an action taken while they were on duty. This situation can be remedied by revising paragraph (a)(3) to refer in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) to threats to or endangerment of persons engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties including the administration of the National Forest System.  Existing paragraph (a)(4) would be revised to clarify that these regulations apply within the boundaries of those components of the National Trails System or the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System that are administered by the Forest Service.  A new paragraph (a)(5) would be added to provide the agency a means of protecting personal property of forest users in the absence of a response by local law enforcement agencies. At present, if a forest user has personal property stolen or damaged (for example, an ice chest or sports equipment) the Forest Service must rely on State or local law enforcement personnel to investigate and charge the person responsible. However, in many cases, local law enforcement agencies do not have the resources to investigate these cases in a timely manner, and while the Forest Service has authority to investigate the case, it presently has no basis in its regulations for charging a person with misdemeanor theft. This is understandably a source of frustration to forest visitors victimized by theft, especially when trained and equipped Forest officers may be in the area where the theft or incident occurred and are able to identify the person(s) responsible. This addition to the rule would bridge this gap in law enforcement in those cases where local law enforcement agencies cannot respond in a timely manner.  Paragraph (b) of existing 261.1 exempts certain activities allowed for by statute that otherwise may be a violation of this part. The paragraph currently cites The Wilderness Act of 1964 and the Mining Law of 1872. The provisions of other laws which would also apply are not included. The paragraph would be revised to make clear the agency's intent to exempt from the prohibitions of this part any activity that is conducted in compliance with other regulations set forth in chapter II.  A new paragraph (c) would be added to make clear that the existence of these rules does not prevent the Federal Government from proceeding with necessary criminal action codified in Federal statutes rather than under these regulations. This revision is necessary to comport with the fact that the United States Department of Justice determines when the Federal Government should pursue criminal sanctions under Federal statute.  A new paragraph (d) would be added to clarify that unless intent is stated in specific provisions, strict liability applies to these regulations. The prohibited acts set forth in 36 CFR part 261 are offenses in the nature of neglect where the law requires care, or are offenses in the nature of inaction where the law imposes a duty (    Morisette     v.     United States,     341 U.S. 262 (1952)). Such offenses ``render[s] criminal a type of conduct that a reasonable person should know is subject to stringent public regulation and may seriously threaten the community's health or safety,'' (    Liparota     v.     United States,     471 U.S. 419, 426 (1985)). Thus, for example, a prohibition of unauthorized livestock on national forest land without regard to whether a person intended to place such livestock there would tend to ensure that a person exercises diligence to prevent resource damage. A person should know that the use of Federal lands is subject to stringent regulation, and that action or inaction in violation of such regulations can cause irreparable harm to the public or the land and its resources.

0,FT942-15936 ,"FT942-15936 _AN-EDMEUAB0FT 940413   FT  13 APR 94 / Tougher law urged for corporate manslaughter      By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent   Reform of the manslaughter laws to make it easier to prosecute companies for acts of gross negligence resulting in death is called for today by the Law Commission. The government's law reform body says the failure in 1991 of the case against PO European Ferries following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster highlights the difficulties of holding companies responsible for gross negligence. The prosecution failed in spite of the findings of a judicial inquiry that there had been a failure of management and that, from top to bottom, the company was 'infected with the disease of sloppiness'. The commission says it has long been the law that a company can be prosecuted for manslaughter where it can be 'identified' with the acts or omissions of one of its controlling officers. But in order to convict a company of manslaughter it was necessary first to prove one of its controlling officers guilty of manslaughter. This might be impossible in a case where death was caused precisely because nobody in the company was thinking clearly about the safety aspects of the company's operations, the commission says. The PO case failed because the prosecution was unable to show that any of the company's senior personnel had realised the way the ship was operated created an obvious and serious risk that it would put to sea with its bow doors open. There have only been three prosecutions for corporate manslaughter - in 1927, 1965 and most recently following the Zeebrugge disaster in 1991. None has resulted in conviction. The commission says this is a 'very unsatisfactory position' and the law should be changed. In a wider report on involuntary manslaughter, it recommends that a company should be held liable for manslaughter in two sets of circumstances: Where the company ought reasonably to have been aware of a significant risk that its conduct could result in death or serious injury. Where the company's conduct fell seriously below what could reasonably have been demanded of it in preventing the risk from occurring or from resulting in the prohibited harm.

A translator and writer, he regularly contributes to  American publications.      Forming an underground seems to be a typically Polish way of coping with a  political disaster. Since the 19th Century, the best men and women of nearly  each generation have felt compelled to leave their homes and families in order  to plot the overthrow of foreign powers, or to struggle for the country's  independence.    It was no accident, then, that on the night of Dec. 12, 1981, when Gen.  Wojciech Jaruzelski's police started to arrest opposition leaders, those who  managed to escape the net went underground and, after a number of aborted  attempts, formed ""Solidarity underground structures,"" better known as Konspira  -- from the Polish word the conspiracy. Soon Konspira was rumored to reach into  the remotest corners of the country, to have a million regular participants, to  run thousands of illegal Solidarity cells and clandestine publishing  enterprises, even to infiltrate the police and the military.    Was it reality or legend? More significantly, was it the best way to deal with  the Polish predicament -- the discrepancy between aspirations of the society  and the dismal political realities of Brezhnev's final years? Most of the  opposition activists who were arrested endured their detainment with dignity,  and after their release undertook all sorts of independent yet open activities  to preserve the Solidarity spirit and push the government toward some kind of  negotiated solution.    They wrote books and published them abroad or underground, organized  clandestine lectures and seminars, launched a campaign of support for the  victims of repression and the declining economy. There were other, spontaneous  expressions of social defiance: wearing forbidden badges and symbols, laying  flowers at the sites of national martyrdom, boycotting various official  institutions, attending church celebrations and street protests. Was Konspira  really the driving spirit and the organizer of all those actions?    In 1982, three young journalists -- Maciej Lopinski, Marcin Moskit (real name  Zbigniew Gach) and Mariusz Wilk -- decided to seek out seven of the best-known,  and best-hidden, leaders of the underground and ask them directly. The result  of their investigation was a book of interviews now made available to the  American reader. ""Konspira,"" published in 1984 by one of the Poland's  underground houses, received an annual Solidarity award for best independent  publication, yet provoked some heated debates among the opposition leaders.  Even an official pro-Jaruzelski weekly, Polityka, chose to reprint fragments of  the book without the authors' permission, and with some obnoxious commentary.    The story of the underground, told in the leaders' own words, was definitely  less heroic and innocent than many expected. It was a story of great sacrifice  and courage, but also of petty ambitions, personal squabbles and the sense of  growing isolation from the mainstream of the political life. The main redeeming  quality in those partly cocky, partly confessional statements is their great  honesty, the sense of moral responsibility and almost obsessive preoccupation  with purity of means and intentions.    What we see here is a sophisticated resistance aware of the many pitfalls of  ""underground mentality."" This awareness is eloquently expressed by one of the  most steadfast and unimpeachable Solidarity leaders, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk:  ""Although everyone wants to fight for an independent Poland, a self-governing  society, brotherhood and so forth, increasingly we are using dubious and  underhanded methods. Brotherhood becomes a fiction, there's no unity, and  ideals get pushed aside.""    Like all underground organizations in history, Konspira had to devote most of  its energy and resources to itself: establishing contacts and setting up safe  houses, training and protecting its people, looking for money and technical  support. Relations with the external world -- the clandestine Solidarity cells  in factories and the society at large -- proved more difficult to manage.  Channels of communication were slow, awareness of the popular moods often  inadequate, and the underground governing body, the Interregional Coordinating  Committee, was hard pressed to find a unified strategy.    Instead of leading and coordinating, Konspira often limited itself to  supporting and evaluating spontaneous initiatives. It was in that area, too,  that the underground suffered occasional setbacks. Some of the strikes and  demonstrations it called for never came off, while others broke out without the  underground's knowledge or approval. Sometimes a letter of support arrived to a  striking factory exactly at the moment when protests were losing momentum, or  the situation was turning dangerous and unmanageable.    The underground's main problem was to justify its existence as something more  than just a symbol of defiance. Yet what was really the long-term purpose of  all its efforts and sacrifices? Contending opinions were voiced in underground  publications but the conclusions often were ambiguous and unconvincing.    The trade-unionist branch pushed for a general strike as a all-out battle with  the government. Some proposed formation of an underground state, with regular  political bodies, its own judicial system and foreign representation, modeled  on the structures that existed under the German occupation. Still others opted  for a broad and loosely organized ""civil society"" that would maintain social  integrity and prepare the Poles for democracy. The controversy was never fully  resolved.    In the end, the Solidarity underground was denied a spectacular victory, or  even a heroic defeat. In 1988, Jaruzelski's government, encouraged by  Gorbachev's policy of ""openness"" and convinced that its own methods never would  assure political and economic stability, started to drift cautiously toward a  negotiated solution, resulting in the ""round-table agreements"" of 1989.    Part of the agreements' success certainly was due to the endurance of the  ""underground men"" who kept reminding the government, the Polish society and the  world that any political solution must take into account the heritage of  Solidarity. Yet the agreement was outlined by those opposition activists --  mostly intellectuals -- who had been acting openly and seeking some  rapprochement with the reform-minded fractions of the government. The result  was a certain sense of bitterness and disappointment among those who devoted  eight years of their lives to the underground.    ""Konspira"" contains a fair amount of interesting human material about the  personal motivations, fears and doubts of these men. It is, undoubtedly, a  valuable historical document, and was reprinted recently in Poland by one of  the new private publishing houses. Yet history seems to be moving too fast to  favor careful reevaluations of the past.    Solidarity, cast simultaneously in the role of the government and the  opposition, clearly is struggling with a crisis of identity. The first  non-Communist government, headed by old Solidarity adviser Tadeusz Mazowiecki,  recently became a target of vitriolic criticism from Walesa and the new  centrist bloc, which proposed Walesa as the next president.    Even with hyperinflation halted, Polish productive powers remain in deep  recession, and the economic miracle many secretly hoped for is slow in coming.  Familiar and disturbing sentiments of chauvinism and intolerance begin to be  heard from some marginal groups. Against all that, the period of anti-Communist  struggle may yet be viewed as an era of moral simplicity and purity.    ""Konspira's"" chief value may be in treating that romantic myth with realism,  without depriving it of its basic nobility.    BOOK MARK: For an excerpt from ""Konspira,"" see Opinion, Page 2.

In 1982, three young journalists -- Maciej Lopinski, Marcin Moskit (real name  Zbigniew Gach) and Mariusz Wilk -- decided to seek out seven of the best-known,  and best-hidden, leaders of the underground and ask them directly. The result  of their investigation was a book of interviews now made available to the  American reader. ""Konspira,"" published in 1984 by one of the Poland's  underground houses, received an annual Solidarity award for best independent  publication, yet provoked some heated debates among the opposition leaders.  Even an official pro-Jaruzelski weekly, Polityka, chose to reprint fragments of  the book without the authors' permission, and with some obnoxious commentary.    The story of the underground, told in the leaders' own words, was definitely  less heroic and innocent than many expected. It was a story of great sacrifice  and courage, but also of petty ambitions, personal squabbles and the sense of  growing isolation from the mainstream of the political life. The main redeeming  quality in those partly cocky, partly confessional statements is their great  honesty, the sense of moral responsibility and almost obsessive preoccupation  with purity of means and intentions.    What we see here is a sophisticated resistance aware of the many pitfalls of  ""underground mentality."" This awareness is eloquently expressed by one of the  most steadfast and unimpeachable Solidarity leaders, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk:  ""Although everyone wants to fight for an independent Poland, a self-governing  society, brotherhood and so forth, increasingly we are using dubious and  underhanded methods. Brotherhood becomes a fiction, there's no unity, and  ideals get pushed aside.""    Like all underground organizations in history, Konspira had to devote most of  its energy and resources to itself: establishing contacts and setting up safe  houses, training and protecting its people, looking for money and technical  support. Relations with the external world -- the clandestine Solidarity cells  in factories and the society at large -- proved more difficult to manage.  Channels of communication were slow, awareness of the popular moods often  inadequate, and the underground governing body, the Interregional Coordinating  Committee, was hard pressed to find a unified strategy.    Instead of leading and coordinating, Konspira often limited itself to  supporting and evaluating spontaneous initiatives. It was in that area, too,  that the underground suffered occasional setbacks. Some of the strikes and  demonstrations it called for never came off, while others broke out without the  underground's knowledge or approval. Sometimes a letter of support arrived to a  striking factory exactly at the moment when protests were losing momentum, or  the situation was turning dangerous and unmanageable.    The underground's main problem was to justify its existence as something more  than just a symbol of defiance. Yet what was really the long-term purpose of  all its efforts and sacrifices? Contending opinions were voiced in underground  publications but the conclusions often were ambiguous and unconvincing.    The trade-unionist branch pushed for a general strike as a all-out battle with  the government. Some proposed formation of an underground state, with regular  political bodies, its own judicial system and foreign representation, modeled  on the structures that existed under the German occupation. Still others opted  for a broad and loosely organized ""civil society"" that would maintain social  integrity and prepare the Poles for democracy. The controversy was never fully  resolved.    In the end, the Solidarity underground was denied a spectacular victory, or  even a heroic defeat. In 1988, Jaruzelski's government, encouraged by  Gorbachev's policy of ""openness"" and convinced that its own methods never would  assure political and economic stability, started to drift cautiously toward a  negotiated solution, resulting in the ""round-table agreements"" of 1989.    Part of the agreements' success certainly was due to the endurance of the  ""underground men"" who kept reminding the government, the Polish society and the  world that any political solution must take into account the heritage of  Solidarity. Yet the agreement was outlined by those opposition activists --  mostly intellectuals -- who had been acting openly and seeking some  rapprochement with the reform-minded fractions of the government. The result  was a certain sense of bitterness and disappointment among those who devoted  eight years of their lives to the underground.    ""Konspira"" contains a fair amount of interesting human material about the  personal motivations, fears and doubts of these men. It is, undoubtedly, a  valuable historical document, and was reprinted recently in Poland by one of  the new private publishing houses. Yet history seems to be moving too fast to  favor careful reevaluations of the past.    Solidarity, cast simultaneously in the role of the government and the  opposition, clearly is struggling with a crisis of identity. The first  non-Communist government, headed by old Solidarity adviser Tadeusz Mazowiecki,  recently became a target of vitriolic criticism from Walesa and the new  centrist bloc, which proposed Walesa as the next president.    Even with hyperinflation halted, Polish productive powers remain in deep  recession, and the economic miracle many secretly hoped for is slow in coming.  Familiar and disturbing sentiments of chauvinism and intolerance begin to be  heard from some marginal groups. Against all that, the period of anti-Communist  struggle may yet be viewed as an era of moral simplicity and purity.    ""Konspira's"" chief value may be in treating that romantic myth with realism,  without depriving it of its basic nobility.    BOOK MARK: For an excerpt from ""Konspira,"" see Opinion, Page 2.

""If the house of Ka'ba or the mausoleum of prophet (pbuh)  [peace be upon him] were in Iran, the criminals would not  hesitate to commit such crimes against those holy places as  well,"" Ayatollah Kashani told the congregation of worshippers  gathered at Tehran University campus. The provisional leader of  the Friday congregational prayers underlined that many  traditions exist about the prophet's blessed household  (ahlulbeit) which stipulate that those who are hostile towards  the prophet's household, are not following any of the Islamic  sects. He said that those who committed this crime were in  complete darkness and that they were incapable of having any  human feeling.    Ayatollah Kashani went on to add that the emergence of the  Islamic resurgence in the world could explain why such acts of  terror were committed against Islam and Muslims.    Referring to the enemies of worldwide Islamic movement, he  said that ""they had also shown their unhappiness with Islam  through explosions and acts of terrorism that they committed  prior to this last incident, (and now) they are hiring those who  are mentally and emotionally slaves and those who are poor in  spirit.""    Ayatollah Kashani added that the more horrible the crime,  the  more effect it will have on helping the growth of political  consciousness of the people. ""The more horrendous the crime,  the more the people's growth and falsehood will gain nothing but  misery,"" he said.    He then addressed the Muslim nations, asking them to condemn  this crime. ""This tragedy is an insult to the divinely  sanctified areas. this is a terrorist conspiracy to destabilize  the (Muslim) countries. Not only Iran, but also the whole  Muslim world, should condemn this horrifying crime,"" he said.    Ayatollah Kashani then invited both Christians and Jews,  respectfully known in Islam as the people of the book, to  condemn this crime. ""Of course the Islamic institutions, both  Sunni and Shia, have condemned this crime and this is not  sufficient. The whole Muslim world and also the people of the  book should come out and condemn this act.""    He also lambasted the world bodies for keeping mum on this  crime. ""The world bodies that always make hue and cry over human  rights should ask themselves why the paid mercenaries of the  world arrogance have committed such a terrible crime,"" he added.     "

Preliminary investigations prove the assassination was  carried out by direct orders from Baghdad and that a large  sabotage network, including diplomats, carried out the operation.    Perhaps it is not unusual for the Iraqi regime to carry out  such practices because it relies on methods of killing and  bodily liquidation as official policy, even inside Iraq. The  question is: What could the Iraqi regime reap from such murder?    The deceased shaykh had lived in Lebanon for a long time.  Lebanese circles say he respected the principles governing his  presence as a guest and was not a direct threat to the Iraqi  regime, although he devoted his life to serving his people's  causes.    It is indeed very sad for Iraqis to see their regime  implementing these murders. But the fact remains that the Iraqi  regime continues to live in isolation, outside the contemporary  world. It is futile even to imagine that there is any  possibility that this regime will behave differently and stop  its ugly methods, known to Iraqis, Arabs, and foreigners alike.    Iraqis are sad and indignant because of the crimes committed  by their regime. This is indisputable. They are not just  witnessing what is happening, but are confronting it with the  means at their disposal, waiting for the right opportunity.    It is unacceptable and unreasonable for conditions in Iraq  to  continue as they are now and for the regime to continue gambling  with the fate of the land and people, after all the disasters it  brought to them over the past years -- disasters whose  humiliating results are impossible to comprehend.    Nevertheless, the Iraqi regime continues to dispatch  sabotage, sedition, and killing missions without doing anything  positive about Iraq, which is now under trusteeship and whose  people are suffering pain and want.    Many strings connected with al-Suhayl's murder have been  unraveled. The Iraqi charge d'affaires in Beirut himself heard  what the detained diplomats said about the murder and the  instructions they had received directly from Baghdad.    Lebanon has regained its strength and unity. It has said it  will not allow sabotage gangs, whether they are Israeli or are  linked with the Saddam regime, to carry out acts of killing and  terrorism on its territory, that all the vicious acts will be  referred to the law so the killers will take the punishment they  deserve.

0,FT942-12018 ,"FT942-12018 _AN-EECCXACVFT 940503   FT  03 MAY 94 / Arts: Native Czech      By ANDREW CLARK   While Prague's two opera companies show waning enthusiasm for the native repertoire, there is still plenty of Czech music to be heard in the city's lovely concert halls, much of it little known in the West. Two recent programmes found the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra tackling works by Vorisek and Novak, and the Prague Symphony accompanying a mass by Ilja Hurnik (b1922). Both were well attended and warmly received by local concert-goers, suggesting that the tourist market does not yet have a monopoly on all cultural life in the Czech capital. The most rewarding discovery was Hurnik's Missa Vinea Crucis, premiered two years ago with organ accompaniment. Hurnik's music is well established in the Czech Republic and deserves a wider reputation. The Mass is a tonal work, clean-textured and full of subtle harmonic modulations, drawing its inspiration from Hurnik's north Moravian folk roots and the Janacek-Martinu tradition, rather than the glum postwar school of Czech modernism. The opening Kyrie, a pure pastoral air, sets an optimistic tone. The Gloria, Credo and Sanctus include spiky interjections for chamber orchestra (no brass), while the Agnus captures some of the otherworldly atmosphere of Messiaen's L'Ascension. The final Deo gratias has a lively rhythmic pull. The 80-strong Permonik Children's Chorus, which commissioned the work, sang without blemish, but could have added more bite. This luxurious opener to the Prague Symphony Orchestra's concert in the Smetana Hall was followed by an inspired account of Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto by Frans Helmerson and Debussy's La Mer. Martin Turnovsky conducted all three with idiomatic flair. Hurnik was one of the many composition pupils of Vitezslav Novak (1870-1949), whose own music has been well represented in the Czech Philharmonic's programmes this season. I heard the song cycle Valley of the New Kingdom for baritone and orchestra (1903), based on a text by Antonin Sova. It is infused with impressionist touches, late Romantic colours and lyrical poetry, and it could have made a kind of Czech Sea Pictures, if the four songs had not been so short - a mere 13 minutes. The music found a heroic upper extension in Ivan Kusnjer's lusty voice. Oliver Dohnanyi, making his Czech Philharmonic debut in the Dvorak Hall, conducted a robust account of Vorisek's D major Symphony, and ended the programme with Dvorak's Symphonic Variations, infused with all the tonal bloom and beauty for which Czech orchestras are renowned.

SOME IN THE REPUBLIC SAY THE DECREE  COULD STIR MORE BLOODSHED.      By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER      MOSCOW      President Mikhail S. Gorbachev moved personally Wednesday to halt mounting  violence by armed bands in Armenia by ordering them disbanded and authorizing  the police and KGB to seize their weapons if they are not surrendered.    Armenians predicted that Gorbachev's decree could spark more bloodshed in their  strife-weary land, but it showed Moscow's exasperation at what Soviet officials  call the clear connivance of Armenian authorities with thousands of armed  militants, considered by many in the Caucasus republic to be their best line of  defense against ethnic attack.    In Armenia, locked for 2 1/2 years in an often bloody territorial dispute with  neighboring Azerbaijan, ethnic tensions have increasingly been accompanied by  attacks on Soviet Interior Ministry troops and other agents of the central  government, which many Armenians say are not the acts of nationalist bands but  of common criminals.    In one 48-hour period last week, three police posts in the capital of Yerevan  were besieged and 10 pistols taken. About 60 armed men forced their way into a  police station in the Talin area and ransacked it. In the Masiss district,  gunmen hurled Molotov cocktails at a traffic police post and burned it to the  ground, while 20 carloads of gunmen blockaded the headquarters of the Armenian  Interior Ministry in Yerevan.    Gorbachev's presidential decree, carried by the official Tass news agency,  showed that Moscow's tolerance for such acts has reached an end. He declared  the units of armed irregulars illegal and ordered them disbanded within 15  days. Members must hand over weapons, ammunition and explosives to police, said  Gorbachev, who also had ordered Lithuanians to temporarily turn over their  firearms when the Baltic republic declared independence in March.    If the militants do not comply, police and KGB units are empowered to seize  their arms. If the bands still ""endanger the safety of the populace and the  state,"" Interior Ministry troops and regular army detachments may be deployed  to fight them.    Soviet media have put the strength of the Armenian irregulars in the tens of  thousands, and one lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, has said they total from  40,000 to 50,000 men. Some Armenians, however, say such numbers are a fantasy  and that the groups have no more than 4,000 members.    In May, more than 20 people were killed when gunmen clashed with troops in the  southern republic. Guerrillas ambushed troops at Yerevan's railway station, and  seven men died in the ensuing gun battle.    Gorbachev said it is time to halt the groups' ""grave crimes"" that have led to  casualities among innocent people. He said criminals, draft-dodgers and  deserters from the Soviet armed forces have been swelling their ranks.    His decree unmistakably was motivated by the recent events in Armenia, although  he did not refer specifically to the republic. The decree may be used,  therefore, to combat armed militants in Kirghizia, Uzbekistan or other  strife-torn Soviet regions.    Lt. Gen. Boris Smolny, first deputy commander of Interior Ministry troops, told  Tass this month that Armenian authorities have given terrorists ""a free hand,  and instigate them to take more daring and cruel actions toward not only the  police and troops but those compatriots who have changed their minds about  illegitimate armed groups.""    However, there was disagreement in Armenia about the effects of Gorbachev's  decree.    Khovik Vassilian, chairman of the Aidak nationalist organization, said  Gorbachev's action could whip up tensions even more.    ""The situation will be fraught with serious consequences, since it may lead to  bloodshed,"" he said.    Vassilian is one of many Armenians who deny that the kinds of illegal acts  mentioned by Gorbachev's decree have anything to do with the self-defense  units, which Armenians have dubbed fedayin, a word for ""commando"" that  Vassilian said they have borrowed from the Turkish.    ""The fedayin are carrying out self-defense functions, and as a rule they never  pose any problems,"" Vassilian said. ""But some of the firearms have gotten into  the hands of a dozen criminal groups, which use them when settling accounts.""    Martin Martirosyan, another Armenian activist, said, ""Everything depends on  what will be meant by the phrase 'illegal armed groups.' "" He said the  republic's Supreme Soviet, or legislature, will discuss whether to declare the  fedayin a ""republican army"" because of the purported failure of Soviet troops  and police to protect Armenians' lives and property.    One reason for Armenians' apprehension at the results of Gorbachev's decree is  that past uses of Soviet army and Interior Ministry troops to combat  manifestations of nationalism in Transcaucasia have led to great bloodshed.    Troops armed with shovels and gas attacked pro-independence demonstrators in  Georgia in April, 1989, and killed 19. In January, soldiers drove into the  Azerbaijani capital of Baku to break a nationalist blockade, and as many as 200  people were killed.

Soviet media have put the strength of the Armenian irregulars in the tens of  thousands, and one lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, has said they total from  40,000 to 50,000 men. Some Armenians, however, say such numbers are a fantasy  and that the groups have no more than 4,000 members.    In May, more than 20 people were killed when gunmen clashed with troops in the  southern republic. Guerrillas ambushed troops at Yerevan's railway station, and  seven men died in the ensuing gun battle.    Gorbachev said it is time to halt the groups' ""grave crimes"" that have led to  casualities among innocent people. He said criminals, draft-dodgers and  deserters from the Soviet armed forces have been swelling their ranks.    His decree unmistakably was motivated by the recent events in Armenia, although  he did not refer specifically to the republic. The decree may be used,  therefore, to combat armed militants in Kirghizia, Uzbekistan or other  strife-torn Soviet regions.    Lt. Gen. Boris Smolny, first deputy commander of Interior Ministry troops, told  Tass this month that Armenian authorities have given terrorists ""a free hand,  and instigate them to take more daring and cruel actions toward not only the  police and troops but those compatriots who have changed their minds about  illegitimate armed groups.""    However, there was disagreement in Armenia about the effects of Gorbachev's  decree.    Khovik Vassilian, chairman of the Aidak nationalist organization, said  Gorbachev's action could whip up tensions even more.    ""The situation will be fraught with serious consequences, since it may lead to  bloodshed,"" he said.    Vassilian is one of many Armenians who deny that the kinds of illegal acts  mentioned by Gorbachev's decree have anything to do with the self-defense  units, which Armenians have dubbed fedayin, a word for ""commando"" that  Vassilian said they have borrowed from the Turkish.    ""The fedayin are carrying out self-defense functions, and as a rule they never  pose any problems,"" Vassilian said. ""But some of the firearms have gotten into  the hands of a dozen criminal groups, which use them when settling accounts.""    Martin Martirosyan, another Armenian activist, said, ""Everything depends on  what will be meant by the phrase 'illegal armed groups.' "" He said the  republic's Supreme Soviet, or legislature, will discuss whether to declare the  fedayin a ""republican army"" because of the purported failure of Soviet troops  and police to protect Armenians' lives and property.    One reason for Armenians' apprehension at the results of Gorbachev's decree is  that past uses of Soviet army and Interior Ministry troops to combat  manifestations of nationalism in Transcaucasia have led to great bloodshed.    Troops armed with shovels and gas attacked pro-independence demonstrators in  Georgia in April, 1989, and killed 19. In January, soldiers drove into the  Azerbaijani capital of Baku to break a nationalist blockade, and as many as 200  people were killed.

0,FT934-16137 ,"FT934-16137 _AN-DJHCKAAHFT 931008   FT  08 OCT 93 / Georgian side ready for talks: UN mediator hopes to bring warring parties together      By FRANCES WILLIAMS      GENEVA   THE GEORGIAN government has agreed to attend peace talks in Geneva which will try to find a political settlement to the bloody civil war between government forces and separatists from the western region of Abkhazia. Mr Edouard Brunner, the Swiss diplomat who is mediating the peace talks on behalf of the United Nations, said yesterday the Georgian side was ready to come to Geneva 'in the next few days'. He hoped subsequently to get both parties around the same table, along with Russia which, he said, had a 'legitimate interest' in the outcome. Leaders of the self-proclaimed Abkhazian government yesterday concluded two days of talks with Mr Brunner in Geneva. Mr Anri Djergeniya, its attorney general, told a news conference that his delegation was ready to 'have a dialogue' with the Georgian government. 'That's why we're here.' Mr Djergeniya made clear that the Abkhazian leadership was not insisting at the outset on full independence from Georgia. He said this would be for the people to decide, once emotions had cooled and some stability had returned to the war-ravaged region. Mr Brunner said later that, despite their military success, the Abkhazians were realistic enough to know that they might have to moderate their political demands. The Geneva peace talks were postponed twice last month because of the renewed fighting in Abkhazia which left the rebels in control of the disputed region. These hostilities have now ended. However, the Georgian government is facing another armed challenge from insurgent forces supporting the ousted president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Aid agencies say an estimated 200,000 refugees fled Abkhazia during last month's fighting, which shattered a Russian-brokered ceasefire agreed on July 27. The Georgian government has appealed for helicopters to evacuate up to 50,000 people trapped in the Caucasus mountains where many are already said to have died from cold and hunger. Mr Djergeniya said yesterday that all refugees, of whatever nationality, were welcome to return home. He blamed reported acts of violence by Abkhazian soldiers against ethnic Georgian civilians as the work of 'criminals'. Mr Brunner said he had been assured by the Abkhazian delegation that such acts would be sternly dealt with and that 2,000 criminal cases were already pending.

The campaign is starting to face strong resistance by  some of the elements of these groups, who are using firearms.  This unprecedented phenomenon signals an increase in the  violence of these groups.    We have learned that the latest arrests have been  concentrated in al-Rusayfah and al-Zarqa' towns and the 'Awjan  area for the past two weeks. Officers and men, assisted by  personnel from the special police force, carried out arrests and  apprehended a great number of people from these groups, which  are believed to have a connection with attempts to plague Jordan  with terrorism.    According to a knowledgeable source, the campaign did not  end  peacefully. One of the suspects fired at a security officer,  wounding him in the leg.    The latest arrests are apparently part of a series of  measures to fight the establishment of terrorist organizations  in the Kingdom financed from abroad. Jordan is taking rather  harsh measures to contain the terrorist groups that have been  formed recently.    AL-BILAD has recently noted a number of attempts on the  world  level, instigated by Israel, as well as other attempts sponsored  by Arab businessmen, to brand Jordan with terrorism and  implicate Amman in a never ending cycle of terror.    We begin in Denmark where big question marks are raised in  connection with a fire at a residence of a Jordanian citizen who  was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and currently resides in  Denmark. According to well-informed sources, the Danish police  arrested three Egyptians following the fire and investigated the  possibility that the suspects are connected to the bombing of  the World Trade Center [WTC]. Two of the arrested men were  political refugees and the third holds Danish citizenship as  well as Egyptian citizenship and currently resides in Denmark.    The three were accused of buying chemicals used to  manufacture explosives similar to those used in the WTC bombing.  The name of the Jordanian citizens, whose house was set on  fire, has not been released. The Danish authorities' arrest of  the three Egyptians is construed as having a link with the fire.  However, the incident created the impression, encouraged by the  United States and Israel, that certain Jordanian nationals are  involved in terrorism.    It goes without saying that for U.S. public opinion, the  most  sensitive act of terrorism is the bombing of the WTC in February  of last year. According to Arab sources, active Israeli  security bodies in Europe are now trying to invent false  connections between Jordanians residing in Europe and Egyptians  suspected of belonging to the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah led by  Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, currently detained in the United  States.    Therefore, Jordan must prepare to confront a media war that  is expected to be launched against it from Washington and  European capitals on terrorism stories similar to the one we  just related.    This war is not isolated from fears by certain Arab sources  that the [Israeli intelligence service] Mosad is perhaps  carrying out assassination attempts against Hamas members in  Jordan. The aim is to create confusion in Jordan and disturb  the security of the country and create a new climate of  terrorist acts.    In short, Israel is endeavoring to drown Jordan in the  maelstrom of terrorism and extremism in two ways: the first is  by giving international public opinion the impression that the  Jordanians have some sort of connection with acts of terrorism  in Europe and the United States; and second, by threatening to  carry out terrorist acts in Jordan itself and disturb the stable  security conditions in the country.    Meanwhile, secret attempts by Arabs have also been revealed  aimed at drowning Jordan in acts of terrorism by financing  groups returning from Afghanistan.    As has already been mentioned, the first Arab involved in  financing terror in Jordan was the Saudi businessman Usamah Bin-  Ladin. Jordanian security investigations have already revealed  that one of the leaders of the Jordanian Afghans, Zakariya  Muhammad Dawud, traveled to Sanaa and met with Yemeni figures  representing the financier, Bin-Ladin, who helped him join  training camps.    Bin-Ladin finances large training camps of Arab Afghans,  including quite a large number of Jordanians, in Sanaa with the  aim of exporting terror to Jordan.    Jordan is exerting immense efforts to apprehend a Saudi  merchant and arms smuggler by the name of Nasir Mashhur  al-Ruwayli. Al-Ruwayli is considered one of the most dangerous  drug traffickers and gun smugglers across Arab borders. He uses  drug smuggling in striking arms deals and smuggling these arms  to Arab states.    It is feared that this smuggler was involved in supplying  weapons to extremist groups to carry out terrorist acts.  Members of these groups in Jordan were arrested recently.    According to Arab sources, this smuggler is now charged with  smuggling drugs and arms in many Arab states including Yemen,  Algeria, and Egypt. [passage omitted]     "

By LISA HEINZERLING, Lisa Heinzerling is a lawyer for a public-interest group  in Chicago.      Last December, a man walked into the engineering school at the University of  Montreal armed with a hunting rifle. He entered a classroom and divided the  students he found there into two groups: women and men. Shouting at the women,  ""You're all a bunch of feminists,"" he picked them off as if they were ducks in  a shooting gallery. By the time he had finished his deadly stalk, he had killed  14 women and injured many others. A note found in his pocket after he had  killed himself declared that women had ruined his life.    The man in Montreal killed these women because he hated them -- not as  individual persons, but as women. The law in this country would not, however,  consider these murders crimes of hate.    We have come to use the term hate crime to refer to a crime committed not out  of animosity toward the victim as an individual, but out of hostility to the  group to which the victim belongs. The attack in Howard Beach, in which one  black man was killed and two were beaten by white assailants, is one of the  most notorious examples in recent years.    Some states have enacted laws specifically directed at hate crimes. California,  for example, requires the collection and analysis of statistics on hate crimes.  Other states either elevate a crime such as second-degree assault to  first-degree assault where the assault was motivated by the victim's membership  in a particular group or establish a separate crime such as ""ethnic  intimidation.""    Recently enacted legislation directs the federal government to gather  statistics on such crimes.    None of these laws include gender as one of the motivating characteristics that  can turn an ordinary crime into a crime of hate. The new federal law, for  example, considers hate crimes to be those impelled by the victim's race,  ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Other, similar laws recognize as  crimes of hate only those motivated by the victim's race, color, creed,  religion or national origin.    Thus, if a woman is beaten, raped or killed because she is a woman, this is not  considered a crime of hate.    ""Race, color, religion, sex and national origin"" has become a kind of refrain  in our laws against discrimination. These characteristics invariably appear  together as the forbidden criteria for the allocation (or withdrawal) of  benefits such as education, employment and housing. One must, therefore, do a  double-take when reading a discrimination statute that does not include gender  as one of the forbidden bases for conduct.    The reason for this exclusion cannot be that there is no problem. The special  risk faced by women in this country because they are women cannot be denied. We  have learned to order our lives according to this special danger, so much so  that when we refuse thus to arrange our lives, we are held equally as  accountable as our aggressor for any injury that results.    Nor can the reason for failing to recognize some acts against women as hate  crimes be that it is impossible to differentiate between those crimes and  ""ordinary crimes."" We do not worry about this evidentiary snag in declaring  that crimes motivated by the victim's race, creed or national origin are hate  crimes. Indeed, one of the purposes of the new federal statute is to establish  a method for identifying crimes of hate.    We are not, it is true, accustomed to thinking of crimes against women in the  same way that we think of racial or ethnic violence. We tend, instead, to treat  brutalizing acts against women either as isolated cases -- that is, as events  brought about by some specific characteristic or conduct of the victim -- or,  in rare cases, as manifestations of racial or ethnic hatred.    Thus, in searching for the reason why a group of boys brutalized a jogger in  Central Park last spring, virtually everyone turned to race; the boys were  black, the woman was white. But another white jogger in the park that night --  a man -- was also beaten, was not raped, was not, in short, treated as if he  were less than human. It is at least curious, therefore, that people did not  seize upon the one feature distinguishing the two runners -- gender -- and  declare that a catalyst for the boys' most savage crime.    This hesitation in pronouncing an act victimizing a woman a crime of hate is no  reason not to pronounce it so. Indeed, this hesitation may be a symptom of the  very pathology that produces such a crime. To deny that the outrages committed  in Montreal are crimes of hate is to defy the facts, and to deny such acts our  censure is to signal that crimes committed against women because they are women  do not trouble us very much. That is a message welcome to no one but the  misogynist.

We do not worry about this evidentiary snag in declaring  that crimes motivated by the victim's race, creed or national origin are hate  crimes. Indeed, one of the purposes of the new federal statute is to establish  a method for identifying crimes of hate.    We are not, it is true, accustomed to thinking of crimes against women in the  same way that we think of racial or ethnic violence. We tend, instead, to treat  brutalizing acts against women either as isolated cases -- that is, as events  brought about by some specific characteristic or conduct of the victim -- or,  in rare cases, as manifestations of racial or ethnic hatred.    Thus, in searching for the reason why a group of boys brutalized a jogger in  Central Park last spring, virtually everyone turned to race; the boys were  black, the woman was white. But another white jogger in the park that night --  a man -- was also beaten, was not raped, was not, in short, treated as if he  were less than human. It is at least curious, therefore, that people did not  seize upon the one feature distinguishing the two runners -- gender -- and  declare that a catalyst for the boys' most savage crime.    This hesitation in pronouncing an act victimizing a woman a crime of hate is no  reason not to pronounce it so. Indeed, this hesitation may be a symptom of the  very pathology that produces such a crime. To deny that the outrages committed  in Montreal are crimes of hate is to defy the facts, and to deny such acts our  censure is to signal that crimes committed against women because they are women  do not trouble us very much. That is a message welcome to no one but the  misogynist.      Drawing, PUNCH      Opinion    "

The heroic popular uprising in South Korea on April 19,  1960,  was a massive anti-America, anti-fascist resistance against the  U.S. imperialists' colonial domination and their stooges'  fascist suppressive rule and for independent and democratic new  politics, new system and new life.    In his report Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the Central  Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea,  said the April popular uprising developed the anti-America,  anti-fascist struggle and national reunification movement of the  South Korean students and people to a new stage and fully  demonstrated worldwide their indomitable, patriotic spirit.    He said the desire of the uprisers had not yet been realised  in South Korea because the U.S. imperialists were still pursuing  the old policy of keeping hold on South Korea as their colony.    He said:    ""The United States has not only failed to implement the  DPRK-U.S. joint statement but also reversed the simultaneous  action steps agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York,  made the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks abortive under an  unreasonable pretext and egged some dishonest officials of the  International Atomic Energy Agency on to take `the nuclear  issue' of the DPRK to the United Nations Security Council in a  bid to isolate and stifle the DPRK by abusing the name of the  United Nations. The United States has brought nuclear war  equipment including Patriot missiles into South Korea and massed  nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and many warships in the  waters around the Korean peninsula. This indicates that the  United States is seeking a solution to the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula with `strength.'    ""The Kim Yong-sam group has engaged in flunkeyist and  treacherous acts, following outside forces, suppressed the  pro-reunification patriotic forces, acted a shock brigade in the  `nuclear' clamor against the DPRK, chiming in with the United  States in its strategy of a nuclear war, to extremely  deteriorate the North-South relations and bring the danger of  nuclear war to the Korean peninsula.    ""All the compatriots in the North, South and overseas must  rise up as one in the nationwide struggle for national  reunification through confederacy and open a new phase for the  country's reunification this year, united closely under the  banner of `10-point programme of the great unity of the whole  nation for the reunification of the country,' irrespective of  idea, political view, religious belief, political grouping,  classes and strata and property status.""

In a statement on the incident, Councilor Phillip Banks, who  has [words indistinct] for the Ministry of Justice, condemned  the killings, noting that such acts not only violate the Cotonou  accord, but are wanton violations of several international human  rights conventions to which Liberia has subscribed, as well as  the violation of human rights of innocent unarmed civilians.    The councilman further noted that there can be no  justification for the barbaric atrocities committed against  unarmed, helpless civilians. The council, he said, has  therefore instructed the Ministry of Justice to launch a  full-scale investigation into the incident, and to promptly  bring the perpetrators to justice.    Inveighing the directives of the Ministry of Justice,  Councilor Banks stated that the violators must be subjected to  trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He called on  the Ministry of Justice to put necessary machinery in place for  that purpose. The council, he noted, will not countenance such  acts against the citizens of Liberia.    The councilor noted further that while the council has not  pursued persons who violated the human rights of the Liberian  people prior to the Cotonou accord and since the council's  seating, it has no intention of permitting the perpetration of  crimes against innocent Liberians by any person or a group of  persons, or of allowing those who have committed such crimes to  go unpunished.    Such war crimes, the council emphasized, are not covered by  the amnesty provisions in the Cotonou Accord and therefore those  identified as being responsible for the perpetration of such  crimes must be formally charged, and when convicted should be  bear the full punishments prescribed by the relevant  international conventions and the penal laws of Liberia. This,  he said, includes punishment by death.    Meanwhile, the councilman has instructed Justice Ministry to  have the area where the incident occurred and other areas of the  city securely covered and monitored, so as to avoid a repetition  of the incident. The council, he said, is calling upon ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] to (?fully) coordinate with and involve Liberians [words  indistinct], especially personnel of the Liberia National  Police, to ensure the maximum protection of all citizens and  residents in areas under the control of ECOMOG and the Liberia  National Transitional Government.

The colorful program includes the chorus ""Our General Is the  Greatest,"" the male vocal solo ""Wherefrom Come Exploits"", the  dance ""We Are a-Match-for-a-Hundred Soldiers"" which present in  strongly appealing artistic depiction the great appearance of  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as a brilliant commander,  the loyalty of the People's Army soldiers who resolutely defend  him with arms and their optimistic life.    The ensemble is the first stage art group of Korea formed in  March 1947.    Since its foundation it has created more than 1,000 stage  pieces of high ideological and artistic plane which cater to the  requirements of the times and given 25,800 performances. During  the fatherland liberation war (1950-1953), it put on stage ""Song  of the Defence of the Country"", ""To a Decisive Battle"" and ""My  Song in the Trench"" and other famous songs, rousing the People's  Army soldiers to heroic feats.    The ensemble greeted the heyday in its development in the  1970s. In that decade Comrade Kim Chong-il indicated the  orientation and ways of creation so that it might conduct art  activities in keeping with its mission and gave a meticulous  guidance to it.    Under his energetic guidance, it completed the creation of  the revolutionary opera ""A True Daughter of the Party"", a  people's prize laureate, in December 1971. The opera portrays  heroine of the republic An Yong-ae, a nurse of the Korean  People's Army who fought courageously during the Fatherland  Liberation War with unfailing loyalty to the party and the  leader. The opera has been performed on more than 1,100  occasions at home and abroad. It is still acclaimed by the  audience for its high ideological and artistic level.    The ensemble has writers Sin Un-ho and Choe Chun-kyong who  are ""Kim Il-Song Prize"" winners, people's actor Choe Chang-nim  and people's actress Kim Ok-son, who are singers, dancers Pak  Ae-na and Hong Chong-hwa who are people's actresses and other  veteran actors and actresses and promising new faces.    It has produced a merited male chorus and a merited  Kayagum-accompanied singers group and it is playing a leading  role in creating a new form of the song and dance performance in  the country.    Vivid artistic presentation of the reality and militant  dignified and grand style are what distinguish it from others.    The song and dance ensemble was awarded the Kim Il-song  order, the supreme order of the DPRK, for its meritorious  services in art creation.     "

The Nicaraguan people, especially the Sandinists,  happily join in celebrating this historic date, which symbolizes  freedom and dignity for the Cuban people, the Latin American and  Caribbean peoples, and the peoples from the North and South who  have been able to appreciate the importance of this event.    In its 35 years, the Cuban Revolution has been able to  overcome the many obstacles placed by the intolerant U.S.  Governments: the blockade, the attacks, the invasions, the sting  operations, and the slanderous campaigns. All these obstacles,  among others, have sought to deny the Cuban people their right  to self-determination.    Marti's people have not weakened or given up during these 35  years; on the contrary, they have risen amid the aggressors'  onslaughts. Cuba has been able to resist and show solidarity to  the world's peoples. The Nicaraguan people have indelible and  priceless memories of the generosity of these heroic people.    A century is about to end, and a new millennium is about to  start, but it is painful to see how, despite the meteoric  technological developments achieved by humanity, we will reach  the next millennium without having eradicated famine, poverty,  and the degradation of human beings. Quite the contrary, such  scourges have worsened in most countries. It is even more  painful to see how the U.S. Governments, acting above national  and international laws with impunity, have been the first to  deny Cuban people the right to build freely a society free of  illiteracy and high infant mortality, and, above all, a society  that is dignifying for human beings.    On this 35th anniversary of the victory of the Cuban  Revolution, may you, Comrade Fidel, the Cuban people, and your  party receive tokens of love and solidarity from the people of  Augusto Sandino and Ruben Dario. We trust that Cuba will reach  the next century with a stronger revolution that is free of the  U.S. blockade and the meddling of U.S. rulers.    Greetings from the Sandinist National Liberation Front and  from the Nicaraguan people. Best wishes for you and your people.  Fraternally,  [Signed] Daniel Ortega Saavedra     "

So it was appropriate that the company's 30th anniversary, celebrated at the Royal Opera House on Sunday, should have been marked by a repeat staging of Gluck's penultimate opera. The revival brought one major change of cast: the baritone Francois Le Roux as Orestes. He is a stylish singer, with (naturally) fine French delivery - a pleasure to listen to. The other principals were returning, and it was no less a pleasure to encounter Jennifer Smith's freshly voiced Iphigenia. Her flexible, well-projected soprano conveyed the music's myriad moods - most affecting was the way she plumbed the depths of despair in her lament 'O malheureuse Iphigenie]'. Andreas Jaggi was an accomplished Pylades who used his smallish tenor deftly; only the bravura demands of 'Divinites des grandes ames' defeated him. Donald Maxwell was incisive as the tyrant Thoas, and Fiona Rose's Diana was effective in her climactic last-act entrance. The company is fortunate in having the services of the energetic conductor Marc Minkowsky, a specialist in this genre. His was a dramatically paced account, light and crisp. The period orchestra sounded thrilling at Covent Garden, limpid in the opening minuet, biting in the palpitating accompaniment prior to Orestes's nightmare, raspy in the Janissary effects which Gluck deploys for the Scythian dances. English Bach Festival's approach to works of this period is justly acclaimed, and accords well with the heroic style of Gluck. Alain Germain's production is a breathtaking spectacle, complete with ballet (choreography by Stephen Preston) and costumes (by Terence Emery) based on late-18th century models. It is much more than a 'concert in costume', even if at times it does not wholly capture the turmoil Guillard's libretto suggests - the Act 4 recognition scene seemed restrained. Perhaps in its serenity the staging echoes Gluck's poignant use of major keys in denoting terrible grief. The work contains so much inward psychological action that it can lend itself to expressionistic treatment at the hands of 'concept' producers - and at least this period-conscious staging preserves its timeless quality. The virtues of Iphigenie en Tauride are sung more frequently than the opera itself, so it is a pity that this performance was a one-off. The production will be given twice at next month's Athens Festival.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P7922 Theatrical Producers and Services.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0,FT944-3497 ,"FT944-3497 _AN-ELNDJADWFT 941213   FT  13 DEC 94 / Arts: Goldschmidt premiere - Concert      By ANTONY BYE   For all the confrontational nature of much of its art, the 20th century has given us a surprisingly large number of accessible violin concertos by composers as diverse as Bartok, Britten, Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Walton. At its first British concert performance on Thursday at the Royal Festival Hall, 40 years after its completion, Berthold Goldschmidt's Violin concerto was given every chance to succeed as well: the interpretation, at least, seemed everything the composer could have wished for. Such belated premieres are nothing new for the Jewish refugee who settled in England, where he abandoned composition entirely. Recently Goldschmidt's fortunes have changed and he has resumed composing. CDs of both his earlier and later music are proliferating and his two operas have recently been staged in Germany. The Violin concerto offers no grandiose world-view such as one might expect from a composer who was instrumental in getting Mahler's music recognised in Britain. It owes more to Stravinsky and Hindemith, an attractive four movement work, new-classical in outline but shot through with darker undercurrents. The fourth movement is perhaps less convincing than the first three, which are beautifully crafted and idiomatically written for the violin. The first, in particular, shows Goldschmidt at his finest: rhapsodic in form, one idea generates the next in a succession of episodes which embrace a gamut of moods from bitter-sweet lyricism to turbulent polyphony. My only doubts lay with the quality of the work's raw materials. The gestures are all in place, but are the melodies memorable enough? The young Canadian violinist Chantal Juillet certainly tried to convince us that they were, dispatching the often fiendish solo part with heroic aplomb. Charles Dutoit and the Philharmonia Orchestra provided firm, colourful support, on top form after opening with a reliable but solid account of Bizet's Second L'Arlesienne Suite. In spite of the obvious attractions of the Goldschmidt, however, it was a magisterial account of Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony which provided the most nourishing experience of the evening. Even though the orchestra's guest leader, Hugh Bean, collapsed dramatically during the first movement (he was later reported to be comfortable in hospital), the orchestra responded with playing of great power and warmth, fully at one with Dutoit's broad, romantic conception and firm structural command of a work which can all too easily sound protracted and coarse - a fine tribute to the Philharmonia's professionalism and Dutoit's consummate artistry.

It has been learned that from January to April,  procuratorial  organs at all levels across the country prosecuted at people's  courts 5,634 cases of economic crimes, including cases of  corruption and bribery, involving 6,738 persons of whom 115 were  cadres at or above the county or department level.  Procuratorial organs in various localities also promptly  arrested and prosecuted a number of gangster-robbers, rapists,  and other gang criminals according to the law. At the same  time, procuratorial organs at various levels promptly arrested  and prosecuted a number of highwaymen and train robbers who had  done great harm to society, thus initially changing the  situation for the better in some key areas and key sections of  highways and railways. Cases of smuggling by units were  investigated and handled. From January to April, 35 major cases  of smuggling involving legal persons were directly investigated  and handled by procuratorial organs.    Liang Guoqing pointed out: Political and social stability  now  prevail in our country. However, public order has yet to be  strengthened in some localities. He said: Social evils are  often accompanied by grave crimes, serious acts of fraud --  especially financial and commercial fraud -- and crimes  committed by legal figures that seriously jeopardize public  order. Criminals often collude with members of some units, and  the latter go along with the former in their evil deeds. He  called on procuratorial organs at all levels to link the effort  to crack down on serious crimes with the struggle against  corruption. He also called on them to vigorously prosecute  cases of economic crimes, including cases of corruption and  bribery, and crack down on such criminal activities.    Liang Guoqing stressed: In the near future, procuratorial  organs should select a number of major, influential cases for  prosecution at people's courts in order to create a strong  momentum in cracking down on criminal offenses and crimes of  corruption and bribery.    At the conference, leaders of provincial, autonomous  regional, and municipal people's procuratorates also discussed  questions such as arrests, prosecutions in court, and protests  by procuratorial organs.

We have learned that the latest arrests have been  concentrated in al-Rusayfah and al-Zarqa' towns and the 'Awjan  area for the past two weeks. Officers and men, assisted by  personnel from the special police force, carried out arrests and  apprehended a great number of people from these groups, which  are believed to have a connection with attempts to plague Jordan  with terrorism.    According to a knowledgeable source, the campaign did not  end  peacefully. One of the suspects fired at a security officer,  wounding him in the leg.    The latest arrests are apparently part of a series of  measures to fight the establishment of terrorist organizations  in the Kingdom financed from abroad. Jordan is taking rather  harsh measures to contain the terrorist groups that have been  formed recently.    AL-BILAD has recently noted a number of attempts on the  world  level, instigated by Israel, as well as other attempts sponsored  by Arab businessmen, to brand Jordan with terrorism and  implicate Amman in a never ending cycle of terror.    We begin in Denmark where big question marks are raised in  connection with a fire at a residence of a Jordanian citizen who  was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and currently resides in  Denmark. According to well-informed sources, the Danish police  arrested three Egyptians following the fire and investigated the  possibility that the suspects are connected to the bombing of  the World Trade Center [WTC]. Two of the arrested men were  political refugees and the third holds Danish citizenship as  well as Egyptian citizenship and currently resides in Denmark.    The three were accused of buying chemicals used to  manufacture explosives similar to those used in the WTC bombing.  The name of the Jordanian citizens, whose house was set on  fire, has not been released. The Danish authorities' arrest of  the three Egyptians is construed as having a link with the fire.  [see 7 January Terrorism Report for initial arrest report]  However, the incident created the impression, encouraged by the  United States and Israel, that certain Jordanian nationals are  involved in terrorism.    It goes without saying that for U.S. public opinion, the  most  sensitive act of terrorism is the bombing of the WTC in February  of last year. According to Arab sources, active Israeli  security bodies in Europe are now trying to invent false  connections between Jordanians residing in Europe and Egyptians  suspected of belonging to the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah led by  Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, currently detained in the United  States.    Therefore, Jordan must prepare to confront a media war that  is expected to be launched against it from Washington and  European capitals on terrorism stories similar to the one we  just related.    This war is not isolated from fears by certain Arab sources  that the [Israeli intelligence service] Mosad is perhaps  carrying out assassination attempts against Hamas members in  Jordan. The aim is to create confusion in Jordan and disturb  the security of the country and create a new climate of  terrorist acts.    In short, Israel is endeavoring to drown Jordan in the  maelstrom of terrorism and extremism in two ways: the first is  by giving international public opinion the impression that the  Jordanians have some sort of connection with acts of terrorism  in Europe and the United States; and second, by threatening to  carry out terrorist acts in Jordan itself and disturb the stable  security conditions in the country.    Meanwhile, secret attempts by Arabs have also been revealed  aimed at drowning Jordan in acts of terrorism by financing  groups returning from Afghanistan.    As has already been mentioned, the first Arab involved in  financing terror in Jordan was the Saudi businessman Usamah  Bin-Ladin. Jordanian security investigations have already  revealed that one of the leaders of the Jordanian Afghans,  Zakariya Muhammad Dawud, traveled to Sanaa and met with Yemeni  figures representing the financier, Bin-Ladin, who helped him  join training camps.    Bin-Ladin finances large training camps of Arab Afghans,  including quite a large number of Jordanians, in Sanaa with the  aim of exporting terror to Jordan.    Jordan is exerting immense efforts to apprehend a Saudi  merchant and arms smuggler by the name of Nasir Mashhur  al-Ruwayli. Al- Ruwayli is considered one of the most dangerous  drug traffickers and gun smugglers across Arab borders. He uses  drug smuggling in striking arms deals and smuggling these arms  to Arab states.    It is feared that this smuggler was involved in supplying  weapons to extremist groups to carry out terrorist acts.  Members of these groups in Jordan were arrested recently.    According to Arab sources, this smuggler is now charged with  smuggling drugs and arms in many Arab states including Yemen,  Algeria, and Egypt. [passage omitted]     "

He has consumed an heroic number of vodkas since early morning, which seems to be the best way of coping with down-and-out life in Brezhnev's Russia. Already - as perhaps always - he is gently, beatifically bleary, and as the stations go by he regales us with notes on his journey, anecdotes and reminiscences. Moscow is huge and bleak, and he has never actually managed to find the Kremlin there; in Petushki, however, jasmine scents the air and a lovely woman awaits him. As far as we can tell, he never quite gets there. Venedikt Yerofeev was an intellectual drop-out whose short novel Moskva-Petushki was published in samizdat during the 1960s. In Stephen Mulrine's eloquent adaptation, it makes a rich, blackly funny monologue for Tom Courtenay (who did it first on Radio 3). The obvious comparison with Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell goes only a little way: though Moscow Stations is autobiographical too, Venichka has none of Bernard's cheerful malice, nor - overtly, anyhow - anything of Louis-Ferdinand Celine's scathing fury at the ruined life around him. Instead, like a holy fool, he observes the bizarre, ludicrous and pitiful things that go on around him kindly and dispassionately, from the safe depths of his alcoholic haze. The comedy is mordant, but it is not he who puts the bite into it. Though the drift of the narrative is as uncertain as the direction of the train, the images of moral and civic decay tell their own story. A closer model would be Diderot's once-famous Le Neveu de Rameau, in which another dissolute dissident floats through another collapsing social order. At the Garrick Theatre Tim Hately's stage furnishings are minimal (but crisply enhanced by lighting, sound and direction, respectively by Ian Sommerville, John Irvine and Ian Brown). For almost two hours Courtenay meanders and stumbles with rubber-legged grace on a long, sharply tilted ramp, bare but for a crude bench. Without actorly displays, he conveys a whole, wryly baffled character and his milieu, in a vodka-sodden baritone that holds up beautifully to the challenge. The Garrick is tolerably well suited to the show, though more intimate surroundings would be better. If you go, sit close: the wealth of pawky Courtenay touches that make it more than a staged radio monologue may be partly lost on the back rows.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT922-9895 ,"FT922-9895 _AN-CEEBIAD5FT 920505   FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: Peter Grimes/Cos fan tutte - Glyndebourne      By DAVID MURRAY   The Glyndebourne festival got under way this weekend  - unwontedly early, so as to make time for building the bigger new opera house by 1994, but not too unseasonably. At the dinner interval of Peter Grimes on Saturday there were some intrepid picnickers on the lawn, and many more on Sunday (sunnier and warmer) during Cos fan tutte. The famous gardens, front and side, are intact, though not blooming yet; the cosy rear gardens and the tennis court have already become building sites. We need not be sentimental about the old house. The price of its vaunted intimacy has always been a tight, airless acoustic: good for words, unflattering to many voices, tricky for any conductor handling a Romantic-size orchestra. With 1,150 seats the new house will be larger by only a third, but the extra sound-space should be a boon. On the other hand, producers will be inclined more than ever toward multum in parvo stagings partly because of the irresistible temptation to explore more of the repertoire than really fits Glyndebourne, but also to entertain the ever-increasing proportion of their audience that has no great interest in opera. Trevor Nunn's new production of Britten's Peter Grimes is extremely striking, but not overweening. The large cast, down to the last villager, is presented in such sympathetic detail that the staging never dominates. It opens nevertheless with a terrific visual coup: a whole, towering wall of people crammed into the Borough's Moot Hall for the inquest, and singing with maximum impact. Individual characters emerge at once: Donald Adams' crusty Coroner, Geoffrey Moses' comically long-faced functionary, Susan Bickley's beady-eyed, excitable Mrs Sedley (less of a witch than usual). John Gunter's basic set is a crosswise section of a bleak East Anglian shore, but it can accommodate a slice of the village too  - cramped buildings leaning together, narrow winding lanes: as vividly natural as the Albert Herring sets in the Peter Hall version. Grimes's hut is a plausible boat-hulk, set high enough to leave a dangerous drop to the sea, with room below for the procession of wrathful villagers. Britten's sea-interludes are allowed to speak for themselves against nothing more than a changing play of light on the front-cloth. The grim story is played out with considerable impact. The East Anglian accents that Nunn has made everybody learn are an uncertain asset; sometimes they have the ring of picturesque 'truth', sometimes only self-conscious quaintness. The Peter is an American tenor, Stephan Drakulich, who has clearly made heroic efforts to master the dialect. That may or may not account for his slightly throttled sound; but it is of a piece with the desperately knotted character he presents, near breaking-point with bafflement and anguish. Grimes gets no heroic gloss here, which is a mercy (only Jon Vickers could bring that off); but at his 'Now the Great Bear and the Pleiades', the roof of The Boar opens to reveal a brilliant firmament. A risky inspiration: I thought it struck home powerfully, reinforcing Peter's essential claim to being a lonely visionary. Vivian Tierney sings a lovely Ellen, open-throated and scrupulously musical, too brave and sensible to be either a prissy schoolmarm or a bland saint. As Peter's luckless apprentice, 13-year-old Daniel Wilmshurst is a heart-rending picture of dumb despair. Alan Opie makes a fine, forceful Balstrode, contributing much more to the action than mere sonorous utterances. John Graham-Hall, who was young Albert Herring to the life only a couple of seasons ago, creates a haunted Bob Boles, the sin-wracked Methodist; John Fryatt's Rector is lovingly detailed, and Robert Poulton makes a lithe, flashy Ned Keene. Menai Davies's earthy Auntie and her 'nieces' (Susannah Waters and Sarah Pring) figure strongly, with help from Nunn's canny treatment: there is a hint, not overstressed, that these village whores are also the local Fates. Andrew Davis conducts the London Philharmonic to pointed effect. The score sounds superbly prepared, and there are stinging touches that rarely register in larger houses. The whole has an inexorable flow, never broken by passing events but carrying them. * * * As revived by Michael McCarthy, Nunn's cruise-ship Cos sails on with visible eclat, but without  - so far  - a convinced focus. The six principals are all good enough to weather the distractions provided by the busy, extraneous passengers and crew who populate Maria Bjornson's shifting decks; yet on Sunday the dramatic line went through blurry patches, not so much ambiguous as just undecided about the tone and flavour of the tale. With a few more performances it should find a sharper silhouette. The ladies look too similar, but Renee Fleming and Suzanne Johnston sing them with warmth and subtlety, abetted by Lillian Watson's reliably bright Despina. John Mark Ainsley's stylish Ferrando is slightly shaded by Gerald Finley's lusty, forward Guglielmo. As Don Alfonso, James Maddalena hovers creepily at the edges of the action, a saturnine presence who never quite reveals his hand. Bruno Weil is a serviceable conductor, with some interesting ideas but no knack for welding the great act-finales into single spans. Glyndebourne Festival Opera.

Dear friends, in exactly one year from now, on a May day  just  like this, it will be half a century since the victory in the  Great Patriotic War. Here on Poklonnaya Gora a great monument  will be unveiled in honor of the people's heroic deed. I am  sure it will become our national sacred object, a symbol of the  recognition and gratitude which the descendents of the victors  cannot help but feel.    Congratulations, dear veterans!

This  phenomenon should be dealt with firmly and decisively by the  security agencies. The reason for this is that any person who  takes revenge for what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque by  stabbing a foreign tourist is harming an innocent human being  and rendering a service to Israel and Zionist gangs.    If those who carry out such attacks knew the extent of  sympathy the Hebron massacre has evoked in the United States,  and even Japan, they would definitely feel guilty and come to  the conclusion that they have unwittingly rendered a service to  our enemies. When an ordinary citizen in Europe and the United  States hears that a foreign tourist was stabbed in an Amman  street, or in any other Arab country, he will be more responsive  to Zionist propaganda portraying us as killers and terrorists.    It is not true that every Westerner is our enemy and  Israel's  friend. World public opinion has shifted greatly in favor of  our cause. The intifadah in the occupied territory has opened  the eyes of Westerners to the reality of matters in our region.  European and U.S. citizens are now aware that Zionist  propaganda is misleading and that Israel is a racist,  suppressive state.    It is totally unacceptable that foreigners and tourists in  our country should be targets for spontaneous, emotional  reactions whenever Israel commits a massacre in Palestine. We  should launch a media campaign using television, radio, and the  press to warn against these odious actions that harm our cause  and substantiate Zionist propaganda against us in Western  nations.    Those who regard an attack on an innocent tourist -- whose  true feelings and sympathies are known only to God -- as a  heroic act should follow the example of the occupied territory.  No foreign tourist has ever been attacked in the West Bank and  Gaza, even when clashes and confrontations are raging, save what  happens by mistake. This is why the presence of foreign  journalists and tourists has been utilized in the interest of  the struggling Palestinian people and against Israel and the  Israeli troops.    The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has elicited sorrow and sadness  not just from those who attacked foreign tourists and others  they thought were foreign tourists; all our people were deeply  moved and were in tears over this massacre. However, they  expressed their sadness and sorrow by staging demonstrations,  making donations, or praying for the mercy of the martyrs. They  did not resort to unacceptable reactions, as did those who  attacked our foreign guests.     "

The funeral provider must give the list upon beginning discussion of any of the following:         (1)     The prices of funeral goods or funeral services;         (2)     The overall type of funeral service or disposition; or         (3)     Specific funeral goods or funeral services offered by the funeral provider.     (B) The requirement in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section applies whether the discussion takes place in the funeral home or elsewhere. Provided, however, that when the deceased is removed for transportation to the funeral home, an in-person request at that time for authorization to embalm, required by 453.5(a)(2), does not, by itself, trigger the requirement to offer the general price list if the provider in seeking prior embalming approval discloses that embalming is not required by law except in certain special cases, if any. Any other discussion during that time about prices or the selection of funeral goods or services triggers the requirement under paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section to give consumers a general price list.    (C) The list required in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section must contain at least the following information:         (1)     The name, address, and telephone number of the funeral provider's place of business;         (2)     A caption describing the list as a ``general price list''; and         (3)     The effective date for the price list;     (ii) Include on the price list, in any order, the retail prices (expressed either as the flat fee, or as the price per hour, mile or other unit of computation) and the other information specified below for at least each of the following items, if offered for sale:     (A) Forwarding of remains to another funeral home, together with a list of the services provided for any quoted price;     (B) Receiving remains from another funeral home, together with a list of the services provided for any quoted price;     (C) The price range for the direct cremations offered by the funeral provider, together with:        (1)     A separate price for a direct cremation where the purchaser provides the container;        (2)     Separate prices for each direct cremation offered including an alternative container; and        (3)     A description of the services and container (where applicable), included in each price;     (D) The price range for the immediate burials offered by the funeral provider, together with:        (1)     A separate price for an immediate burial where the purchaser provides the casket;        (2)     Separate prices for each immediate burial offered including a casket or alternative container; and        (3)     A description of the services and container (where applicable) included in that price;            "

It was confusing.    The greatest confusion may not have been Douglas' fault.

[passage omitted]    These days, in the political arena of the governments and  powers of the world on the one hand, and the mass upon mass of  the people of nations on the other, there exist beautiful things  as well ugly ones. The awakening of the nations is a beautiful  thing; the leaning toward Islam by the Muslim nations is a  beautiful thing; the nontolerance of tyranny by the innocent  ones is a beautiful thing. The ugly things are the tyranny of  the tyrants, the bullying of the bullies, and the plotting,  evil-heartedness, and malevolence toward nations.    Among the undesirable and ugly points in the world arena, in  my view, there is one that is most ugly. Today I wish to  emphasize that point so that the view of the Iranian nation  becomes clear for all to see. The point is that we do not  expect the bullies and thugs of the world to be good and not to  behave like tyrants. We do, however, expect fairness and  independence from the forums of the world. The United Nations  is so called because it is a place which belongs to nations. It  does not belong to governments, let alone to certain bullying,  greedy governments of the world. Unfortunately the reality is  something else today, and that is the very ugly point.    Of course we had already seen how the Security Council acts  -- the Security Council which is the principal decisionmaking  body and the heart of the United Nations. We had realized how  much that organization was in the hands of the superpowers in  crucial moments, becoming theirs, rather than belonging to the  nations. That was during the imposed war. When the imposed war  came and Iraq violated our borders and entered several of our  country's provinces we took our protest to the United Nations,  as is usual. As usual, the Security Council should have issued  a resolution condemning Iraq as the aggressor. It failed to do  so. I waited several days. The Iraqi Army, taking advantage of  our unsettled situation at that time, settled itself on our  beloved country's soil, our beloved Islamic Iran -- it seized  several thousand kilometers -- and then, and only then did the  Security Council lift its head to utter a word. It issued a  resolution. What was the resolution? Did it say that the  aggressor must leave Iranian soil? Not at all. It issued a  resolution to the effect that Iran and Iraq should declare a  cease-fire. What does that mean? It means that the Iraqi Army  has entered Iranian soil and now that it is the Iranian nation's  turn for a heroic defense its hands must be tied; no one is to  defend the country and the Iraqis should not be thrown out.  That was the Security Council's resolution!    You know that for several years they said the same thing  without condemning the aggressor. Of course our combatants, in  not too long a period, within almost one and a half years, took  back most of the land themselves. That was the precedent for us  then.    A few years later Iraq's invasion of Kuwait took place.  When Iraq invaded Kuwait there was no oppressed nation involved  there: it was a question of the interests of America and the  superpowers. You all saw how a first resolution was issued in a  matter of hours, saying Iraq must get out of Kuwait. For years  we had asked the Security Council to issue such a resolution  against [as heard] us in the imposed war, but it would not do  so. But within hours it issued that resolution on Kuwait.    Then the Security Council issued several resolutions, one  immediately following the other, permitting the Americans to  enter the Persian Gulf, wreck Iraq, and do what they liked. The  Security Council resolutions on the Kuwaiti war are still in  effect and still being implemented. We have seen that.    In recent months -- once in the case of Bosnia -- the  Security Council should have been fair; we saw that it was not.  Another time was in the case of the holy shrine of Abraham in  occupied Palestine. The Muslim nations said they were prepared  to send soldiers as UN troops, as a buffer between the Serbs and  Bosnian Muslims. The Security Council said Muslims cannot go,  because they are Muslims and may support one side. Of course,  it was a wrong thing to say. The Muslims were going to mediate  and act as a buffer, not to fight. Anyway, they said that, but  at the same time they allowed Russian soldiers, who are  obviously on friendly terms with the Serbs, to go as UN troops  and act as a buffer.    What happened? Why did they not consider that the Russian  soldiers are connected to the Serbs from a standpoint of  religion and other ties? The world's magazines printed  photographs of Russian tanks bearing the UN insignia entering  the region, while the Serbs were shouting slogans, cheering, and  clapping for them. That was one case.    Bosnian Muslims are still being sacrificed; the United  Nations does not care a bit and the Security Council does not do  its duty.    The second issue concerns this bloody tragedy at the shrine  of Abraham. Israel should have been categorically condemned.  It should have been punished, it should have been put on trial,  it should have been forced to accept punishment. The United  Nations should have done this, but it did not. The Security  Council has not taken on its responsibility at all. What is the  reason for this? The reason is the influence of big powers, led  by America, in the Security Council and their influence on the  secretary general himself. Let them know that this is the view  of the Islamic Republic and the people of Iran. The secretary  general himself....[pauses; crowd chants ""God is great,""  ""Khamene'i is the leader,"" ""Death to those who oppose the  supreme jurisconsult,"" ""Death to America,"" ""Death to Israel""]    We do not have a particular enmity toward anyone. We respect  world figures based on their dignity and position. The former  UN secretary general came to Iran time after time. At that  time, the president, the Majles speaker, and Foreign Ministry  officials all welcomed and respected him. If the secretary  general carries out his duties, we will respect him. However,  in our opinion, and in the opinion of the Iranian people, this  present secretary general has not carried out his duties.    The future of these Iranian people is bright. The power of  these people will increase day by day. The roots of these  people will go deeper; their word will be more widely accepted  in the world. Today you can see that this is true. Compared to  10 years ago, we are stronger today, we have more honor in the  world. The people are more forthright, brave, and ready to  follow the great path to the lofty aim, because of the blessings  of Islam and the Koran.    I have one more point to raise at the end of my talk.  Unfortunately, the issue of the hajj has not followed its proper  course so far this year. The Saudi Government is placing  obstacles in the way. And I do not know why. The Foreign  Ministry, the Hajj Organization, the representative of the  leader, the leader's mosque in Medina have made great efforts.  Most of the work of the hajj should have ended by now, by the  end of Ramadan. The Saudis are causing problems.    I don't know why they are doing this. Of course, we are  assuming the best. We hope the Saudi authorities, God forbid,  will not do anything to incur the wrath of the Iranian people.  We hope they will not do anything to make the Muslims of the  world feel that the hajj is another tool in the hands of America  and the big powers. This must not occur, and we hope it will not.    I hereby announce: Hajj is the right of Muslims. The house  of God belongs to Muslims. [passage omitted] The house of God  does not belong to anyone in particular. If anyone has the  honor to manage the house of God, he should thank God and  provide facilities for the peoples to make their trip to Mecca  and not place obstacles in their path. These great and faithful  people, with the interest and enthusiasm that they have to visit  the house of God, the pure grave of the great prophet, and the  graves of the great imams [a'emmeh-ye baqih], peace be upon  them, deserve to be placed at the head of the queue of other  peoples in order to perform the hajj and visit the house of God.    We ask God....[pauses] The hajj issue is an Islamic issue;  it should remain Islamic. It should not be sacrificed for the  international political games of arrogance. [passage omitted]     "

He makes Charlie a sympathetic character who, when he refuses to join the  Confederate Army on moral grounds, becomes heroic in his steadfast idealism.  When Charlie finally must get involved, after his youngest son is taken by  Union soldiers, it's a love of family, not the South or slavery, that moves  him.    Charlie's sons (Jim Wall, Greg Jackson, Ron Samson, Barry Ramsey, Tim Shipman  and Christian Hoff) are a rambunctious lot, quick to get cranky and make fists,  but even quicker to mellow out and be good boys.

It urges the Japanese government to pay each former 'comfort woman' an immediate Dollars 40,000 (Pounds 25,500) in compensation, pending steps to provide 'full rehabilitation and restitution'. The commission's report is likely to embarrass Tokyo at a time when the Japanese government believes it is on the point of resolving an issue which has bedevilled diplomatic relations with its neighbours. At the end of August Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, announced a Dollars 1bn fund to be used over the next 10 years for exchange programmes and vocational training centres for women as a token of apology for war atrocities. But the planned fund does not represent compensation for the women involved. The ICJ, which groups some 45 eminent jurists from around the world, is critical of the handling of the issue by Japan which, it says, appears to be aimed at placating sentiments rather than finding a solution. In thinly veiled language the ICJ accuses Tokyo of dragging its heels and covering up documentary evidence. The Japanese imperial army abducted 100,000 to 200,000 women and girls, often as young as 13, to serve a vast network of 'comfort stations', it notes. If Japan does not take action, the matter should be pursued by an international tribunal or by the United Nations, the ICJ says, adding that the allied governments also bear a responsibility for ensuring the 'comfort women' receive justice. Japan argues that war reparations to individuals and their families were formally settled by the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty. Many governments, including South Korea and Malaysia, have said they would not seek additional state-to-state reparations for comfort women. The acts should have been part of the war crimes trials after the war ended but were not, because the trials focused on acts committed against nationals of the allied powers, the ICJ argues. The ICJ monitors and promotes the rule of law and human rights worldwide. As an non-governmental organisation it has no formal sanctions it can impose. Its reports do, however, carry weight with the UN and by publishing them it hopes the international community will put pressure on governments to correct human rights abuses.

0,FT923-12053 ,"FT923-12053 _AN-CGUANAEKFT 920721   FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: Figures in a landscape - German drawings      By PATRICIA MORISON   SO wrote the young German artist Philip Otto Runge at the dawn of the 19th century. Where this widely-shared conviction of freedom and new beginnings was to take German art is the theme of Neo-Classical and Romantic: German Drawings of the 18th and 19th Centuries at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. These drawings, which come from a German private collection, have in the past two years also been shown in Hanover and Lubeck under the title Goethezeit und Romantik. It will be a good marker of how far this country's re-education into pre-20th-Century German culture will have gone when Goethezeit is no longer felt to need a gloss. The beautifully-printed, hardback catalogue is good value at Pounds 18. This is an exhibition which takes a lot of looking, packed as it is with beautiful drawings and watercolours from the period 1760 to 1860. Among the famous names are Angelica Kaufmann, Josef Anton Koch, Runge himself (a sheet of lively sketches for the portrait of the artist's parents in Hamburg), Caspar David Friedrich, Overbeck, Moritz von Schwind, Goethe's great friend Tischbein, and Goethe himself. Landscape predominates, satisfyingly, because, in the eyes of Runge and his circle, it offered modern artists the chance to excel both antiquity and the artists of the high Renaissance. In Koch's sepia drawing (a very popular medium at this period) of the Schmadribach Waterfall in Switzerland, he includes a modern-dress Judgment of Paris in the foreground, with peasant goddesses in straw hat and mob-caps. However, the point of this exercise was anything but whimsical. Koch, born in the Tyrol, knew his mountains and the interesting claim is made for him as 'the first artist to capture in his painting the powerful emotions evoked by mountains.' Painstakingly exact and yet dramatic, monumental drawings like these were intended to thrill viewers' souls with the philosophic spectacle of creation in all its rugged grandeur. The exhibition is on the whole quiet-toned; most of the watercolours are very restrained in their palettes. However, for virtuoso brilliance it is hard to beat Thomas Ender's mountain view. His technique of combining little strokes of paint with areas of paper left blank, creates a dazzling impression of trees, mud, rock, and sunshine and shadow striking on the snowy summit. Imaginary vistas of heroic landscapes alternate with the sort of tranquil studies of the Italian countryside around Rome in which accomplished draughtsmen continued to pay homage to Claude. The figures who wend through these landscapes are often pilgrims, such was the keen interest even northern Protestants now took in the spectacle of Catholicism. Either that, or they are medieval knights, hunters, hermits, or the kind of Romantic wanderer made so familiar by Schubert. A storm-wracked landscape by Johann Christian Rheinhart is the backdrop to Macbeth's meeting with the witches. Like Koch's comical Teutonic god sitting on a waterfall, it is a useful reminder of the intensely literary preoccupations which still underlay people's approach to landscape in art. To make this point sink in all the better and to tie in the English to the German experience, make sure not to miss the Tate Gallery's enthralling exhibition Turner and Byron (until 20 September: sponsored by TSB). In the final room, which is largely given over to the revivalist movement of the Nazarene Brotherhood, figures become as important as landscape. The Nazarenes' admiration (political as well as aesthetic) for the art of Altdorfer and the Rhineland school shows itself clearly in Moritz von Schwind's drawing of a hermit wading along a stream through the depths of a forest which is, with its grappling tree roots and ivy, extraordinarily alive. Von Schwind and his Nazarene friends also looked to legends of the heroic middle ages, as in his large drawing showing a crusader returning home with a baptised Saracen princess who was to become his bigamous second wife. But for all the attractive discoveries to make - a study of medlars by Horny, Richter's Rest on the Flight into Egypt, the fairy-tale idylls by Schnorr von Carlsfeld - it is the German Romantic artist almost everyone has heard of who still steals the show. There are four landscape sketches by Caspar David Friedrich, two of them not seen before. They take us from the artist's youth through the period of fame and relative fortune, into his sad old age. A sepia landscape near Teplitz, painted in recollection, is one of the last efforts by a man whose strength had ebbed almost to nothing. And yet it is a miracle of subtlety and pathos, something to hold a viewer spellbound and humbled. Neo-Classical and Romantic at the Fitzwilliam, Cambridge, ends on 13 September: closed on Mondays. Certain permanent galleries may be closed in the morning: ring (0223) 332900.  The Financial Times   London Page 13  "

A  RECENT RESURGENCE INDICATES STRONGER ACTION MAY BE NEEDED.      By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Gang-related crime in Harbor City fell by almost half from 1988 to 1989, and  police attribute the drop largely to an innovative program designed to curb  gang activity.    But as crime inches back up, there are signs that the program -- with its  longer jail sentences for gang-related crime and warnings that gang members can  do time for such things as wearing a beeper -- is losing its punch.    Harbor Division police say the two-step program has reduced gang crime --  including assault, murder and robbery -- by 47% in the South Bay community  since it began. Under the first step, based on a 1988 state law and implemented  last July, police created extensive files on known violent street gangs, and  had members sign forms acknowledging their affiliation. That law also provides  for additional jail time for convicted gang criminals.    In the second step, which began last fall, gang members learned of a more  drastic consequence. Police posted warnings telling gang members that the city  attorney would seek a court order permitting police to arrest gang members for  engaging in a number of otherwise legal activities, including such things as  carrying a pager or flashing gang signs.    The effect of those moves was to scare gang members, but the impact may be  wearing off. Without getting an injunction, police are unable to arrest gang  members for otherwise innocent activities, Harbor Division Capt. Joseph De  Ladurantey said. Officials are watching the recent small increase in gang crime  and are discussing filing for the court order.    ""We will seek to use the injunction if we think it is needed. The notice may be  sufficient, and we might take other steps first,"" De Ladurantey said. ""But we  will certainly look at (the court order) if gang crime is not kept at an  acceptable level.    ""It's pretty dramatic,"" he said. ""It means for flashing a gang sign or wearing  a beeper, you could get a year in jail.""    Such court orders are obtained under city ordinances that bar nuisance  activities, such as prostitution at a massage parlor.    Some neighborhood activists say they would welcome the injunction, while civil  liberties activists say the prospect is a nightmare for the Bill of Rights.    Kenneth Salsman, past president of the Palo Del Amo Woods Homeowner's Assn.,  endorsed the idea. ""Without the injunction step, it has really been just an  exercise. I am very enthusiastic about the program and would like to see it  carried to the next step,"" he said.    However, Ramona Ripston, executive director of the Southern California American  Civil Liberties Union affiliate, said: ""It is clearly unconstitutional. It's  just another example of politicians pandering to the public trying to make them  believe that they are coming up with solutions to gangs (and) drugs. But it is  not going to solve the problem, and in the process, we may lose our civil  liberties.""    Deputy City Atty. Bruce Coplen emphasized that not all of the prohibitions in  the notice would necessarily be approved by a judge, but he said some  circumstances justify a limit on civil rights.    The legal theory for such limits has already been sustained in other cases, he  said. An injunction against a West Los Angeles gang in 1987 -- obtained under a  city ordinance -- contained many of the Harbor City prohibitions, Coplen said,  and gang crime dropped off drastically after several cases were successfully  prosecuted.    ""People have a right to be safe and able to walk the street,"" said Coplen,  supervisor of the city's gang prosecution program. ""If someone is terrorizing  you, you have the right to get a court order to demand to stop those  activities.""    The state law's provision for enhanced penalties, which allows an additional  three years on a felony sentence and one year on a misdemeanor, means that a  gang member could potentially serve significant jail time for breaking the  court order, said Coplen.    To police, that is fine. ""It is saying, 'You no longer exist as a gang.' It  says if you are a gang member, you lose your civil rights,"" Detective Mike  Markulis said..    De Ladurantey is cautious, however, about rushing to get a court order now. It  would be tantamount to admitting defeat of the program, he said, adding that he  would ""like to think the kids will realize what this would mean, and do a  little self-enforcement.""    Some members of the Harbor City community worry that the most recent small rise  in crime -- which does not bring gang crime near the levels of 1988 -- may mean  that gangs are starting to call the Police Department's bluff.

Last year, Comrade Kim Chong-il, upon hearing that Yu  Kyong-nam, a soldier of the Korean People's Army, died after  saving his comrades by covering a handgrenade on the point of  explosion with his body, called him a ""fine son of the country""  and put him up as a hero of the Republic.    The self-sacrificing spirit of devoting oneself to the  country and the people is highly displayed among KPA soldiers.  In this course, many heroes and heroines have emerged.    In the 1990s when the Korean revolution has entered a new,  higher stage of development, many heroes have been produced,  including KPA officer Kim Kwang-chol and KPA soldiers Han  Yong-chol and Yim Kwang-chol who laid down their youth for the  country.    They stand like immortals under the deep loving care of  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Their busts were built at their alma maters and their  schools, platoons and companies were named after them.    His loving care based on a high sense of obligation also  reaches the heroic soldiers who passed away long ago.    Standing on the Chujak Peak of scenic Mt. Taesong in the  suburbs of Pyongyang is a revolutionary martyrs cemetery with  busts of anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners who devoted  their whole lives to the liberation of the country and the  happiness of the people.    Saying the anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs are all  heroes  and heroines, Comrade Kim Chong-il saw to it that the medal of  the hero of the Republic was embossed in the centre of the  wreath-laying stand of the cemetery, thus awarding them the  title of hero which had not been conferred upon them in their  lifetime.    Under such benevolence a patriotic martyrs cemetery was  built  in Sinmi-ri in the suburbs of Pyongyang to hand down to the  posterity the exploits of the martyrs who devoted their whole  lives to the cause of socialist construction and national  reunification.    There are many places, industrial establishments,  cooperative  farms and schools bearing the names of heroes in different parts  of the country, more than 100 units in all. They include Kim  Chong-suk county (former Sinpa County) in Yanggang Province, a  historical place associated with the revolutionary exploits of  Comrade Kim Chong-suk, an indomitable communist revolutionary  fighter, during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, Kim  Chaek City (former Songjin City) in North Hamgyong Province, the  hometown of Comrade Kim Chaek, an anti-Japanese revolutionary  fighter, the Yi Su-pok Chemical College in Sunchon and the Cho  Ok-hui Cooperative Farm.

This is a selection      From Mr GRAHAM SIMON   Sir, By raising many good questions while providing little in the way of answers, Samuel Brittan's comments accurately reflect the current, underdeveloped state of economic thinking on the subject of ethics. Perhaps the reason lies in the dichotomy in western thought between the 'self' and 'others'. Economic theory is based on the premise that people act in their own self-interest, the 'self' is implicitly understood to mean the individual or, at a stretch, the family unit. Sacrificial acts done for the sake of 'others' are viewed as an anomaly. To fit such acts into their theoretical framework, economists must rationalise them as bringing a sort of perverse satisfaction to the doer. Brittan concludes that economics needs to be expanded to take account of values. I would suggest a more metaphysical approach: expand, through education, peoples' consciousness of 'self' so that it embraces not only their individual being but their community, nation, the world, and ultimately the whole creation. Manufacturers that felt no sense of separation from the environment would baulk at the thought of polluting the air or water to cut costs. Citizens of rich nations who felt at one with poorer peoples of the world would find it much easier to mobilise the resources needed to eradicate famine and disease. In essence, expanding our awareness of 'self' would not invalidate economic theory, but it would dramatically change the choices we make as individuals and societies. Of course, there are serious obstacles to achieving this. Our educational system would need to be rebuilt around a core set of moral and spiritual precepts. Gaining consensus on the content of this set would be a monumental task. But here, the economists can help. In the 1960s, the work of Theodore Schultz and Gary Becker on investment in education and training altered the attitudes of policymakers worldwide towards the importance of 'human capital'. Similarly, if today's economists were able empirically to link economic advancement to factors like family values, sense of community, trust, and integrity among leaders, our policymakers might invest more aggressively in society's stock of 'spiritual capital'.

The committee held eight hearings from July 1993 to February  this year, to prepare the long report which is entitled:  ""Sino-British Relations Around 1997."" At the hearings, many  people of insight criticized Patten and the British Government's  policy on the Hong Kong issue, called for setting sights on  overall Sino-British relations and for cooperation with China,  and opposed confrontation. However, ignoring the facts, the  report asserts that Patten's constitutional reform package does  not violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the ""Basic Law,""  and the agreements reached between Chinese and British foreign  ministers; and holds that Patten was correct in unilaterally  announcing his constitutional reform package in October 1992  without consulting China beforehand. The report states the  committee supports the British Government in continuing to do  things in its own way and in submitting the entire political  reform package to the Hong Kong Legislative Council for  examination. The report says: Given the current deadlock, it  is impossible to win China's cooperation by revising the reform  package. On the contrary, such an act will only draw opposition  from a sizable number of people on the Hong Kong Legislative  Council, impair the Hong Kong Government's prestige, and may  jeopardize Hong Kong's stability and economic order. For this  reason, the committee ""supports the foreign secretary in  refusing to strike a deal with China,"" and says the Hong Kong  governor should submit ""as soon as possible"" the entire bill to  the legislative council for examination.    Without the least reason, the report blames China for the  slow progress in Sino-British Joint Liaison Group talks,  claiming that, if China continues to obstruct the group from  holding further talks, the Hong Kong Government will have no  choice but to submit the necessary legislation to the  legislative council so Hong Kong's laws can be revised and made  regionally-oriented before sovereignty is transferred to China.    Moreover, in the ""political and foreign relations"" section,  the report suggests relations between the British Parliament and  Taiwan's Legislative Yuan be strengthened; and urges the British  Government to re-examine the status of Taiwan's office in  Britain and to relax restrictions on it. The report also  encourages Britain to discuss the so-called Tibet human rights  issue, blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs.    Observers here have pointed out that, at a time when  Sino-British relations are already in a very difficult state  because of Britain's perverse acts over the Hong Kong issue, the  British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee report  will inevitably create more adverse effects on relations between  the two countries; therefore, the report should attract people's  attention.

In 1993, conditions were not the same in all countries of  the  region, but there were some common denominators. In light of  the Gaza-Jericho accord, the face of the Middle East will  undergo a transformation in 1994 as the United States gains its  objectives based on the trend toward compromise.    Most of the countries will relinquish part of their  geopolitical positions, and countries that are emulating the  U.S. model will gain from this situation. It is an immutable  fact that a large part of the world's oil resources are  concentrated in the Middle East, but there is no sign of any  development patterns in the region. If, in 1993, the Middle  East witnessed Clinton's hosting Rabin and 'Arafat in the White  House, it was solely because during the eighties, a country by  the name of Iraq had embarked on an extensive war and opened the  path for the West to enter Islamic countries in the nineties.  This is the beginning of the end of an era in which resistance  took on a different connotation.    In the current year, the United States is contemplating the  manifestation of another Gaza-Jericho accord so that it can make  the region subservient and calm. The region should at the same  time be a center for harboring a potential crisis that can be  escalated into a war when the need arises.    If those countries that are on the U.S. blacklist do not  react, they will not get a chance to defend themselves.  International economic conditions have transformed the Middle  East into an oil-producing area and at the same time a consumer  of goods. By the end of 1993, the Middle East oil prices had  reached an unimaginable all-time low, despite the onset of the  cold winter season. The hue and cry for human rights is also  heard and most Middle East leaders have not yet understood the  meaning of unity, of ending their differences, and may perhaps  never do so.    What makes the difficult days of the nineties bearable for  the free nations of the region, however, is the cry of the  intifadah.    In any case, the Americans will step up their pressure on  the  progressive and independent countries of the region in order to  eliminate the last vestiges of resistance. They will certainly  adopt an independent approach toward each country so that the  others do not wake up to it and are not aware of the danger.  The Middle East of 1994 will be replete with compromising  plans and levers of pressure for the United States so that a new  picture may be drawn up.     "

The Maximo Gomez thermoelectric plant, one of the nation's  largest with an installed capacity of 600 megawatts, suffered  damages and had to be removed from the national network. Other  plants throughout the country have also been damaged by Cuba's  heavy oil, which can cause serious damage if it is not  adequately treated or if adjustments are not made to the  industrial equipment in which it is used. Cuba has been forced  to use this heavy oil to generate a considerable amount of the  electricity required by the country, because there is an  insufficient amount of light oil for all of the generators.    Workers at the Maximo Gomez plant are struggling tooth and  nail to repair this important power plant before the month is  over in an effort to restore services to the limited level the  people were receiving before the plant went off-line. Problems  like these, which pose a daily inconvenience for the entire  population and generate severe economic problems because they  paralyze various services that require electricity, are  characteristic of the critical economic situation Cuba has  suffered ever since the USSR collapsed and the full burden of  the criminal blockade imposed more than 30 years ago by the U.S.  Government was brought to bear on the country.    This blockade has now been intensified by the well-known  Torricelli amendment, whose purpose is to extend the so-called  embargo to all of the countries that maintain commercial ties  with Cuba. This is yet one more difficulty the Cuban people  must deal with. It is perhaps one of the main difficulties, if  you will, but certainly not the only one, because the industrial  sector is nearly paralyzed by a shortage of fuel, replacement  parts, lubricants, fertilizers, and numerous other resources  which, in turn, has created the worst economic situation in the  country's history.    A situation like this would have made the best of the  capitalist or so-called democratic-representative governments  collapse. In Cuba, however, we have a heroic people who are  resisting, because they know what they are defending, and  because they are fully aware of what they would lose with the  disappearance of their socialist system, which has brought them  so many achievements, not only material, but also moral and  spiritual. This is why the Cuban people voted overwhelmingly in  favor of the revolution headed by Fidel Castro during the recent  elections. This is why Cuba has so much strength and prestige  throughout the world. This is why the Cuban people will  continue fighting until they achieve victory.     "

During the meeting, Taha Yasin Ramadan  reiterated Iraq's unchanging stand on the recent events in  Yemen. He said Iraq supports Yemeni unity and legitimacy. He  said the enemies are working to partition united countries into  several parts to facilitate the achievement of their colonialist  ambitions, to control them, and to interfere in their internal  affairs.    He said the unity of Yemeni territory and people is a source  of strength for the Arab nation, and that the support extended  to the separatists by some Arab rulers provides another piece of  evidence that those agents' are conspiring against the Arab  nation in a bid to dismember it, on orders from colonialist  powers.    The Yemeni parliamentary delegation leader expressed high  appreciation and great pride in the heroic stand of President  Saddam Husayn and the great Iraqi people. He said the Iraqi  people have become an example and a model for steadfastness and  sacrifices, through which they have scored great victories and  thwarted conspiracies and aggressions. He indicated that the  Yemeni people will fight in defense of the one homeland and the  one people, and that they will thwart this chapter of conspiracy  against Yemen and the Arab nation.    Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan also received Pascal  Jacquino [name as transliterated], head of the diplomatic and  strategic institute in France and head of the higher school for  the press, and his delegation. The vice president stressed that  many states are suffering economic and security problems as a  result of the 30-state aggression against Iraq and the continued  blockade imposed on its people. He indicated that continued  U.S. hegemony and efforts to implement U.S. ambitions and  colonialist policies will jeopardize world peace and security.  He said America's allies have lost their independent  decisionmaking ability and their sovereignty.    He indicated that the disagreement of most UN Security  Council member states with the U.S. Administration is considered  a defeat for America and a victory for Iraq, because Iraq has  managed to thwart all America's conspiratorial, aggressive, and  misleading tactics on the military, economic, political, and  propagandist fronts.    Taha Yasin Ramadan stressed that Iraq will remain as it has  always been throughout history -- with a united land and people,  Arabs and Kurds, rallying around their leader and symbol, Saddam  Husayn and his wise and brave leadership, which has made the  Iraqi people a model for emulation by countries that adhere to  their principles, defend their objectives, and reject  humiliation and subservience.    Pascal Jacquino expressed confidence in Iraq's prosperous  future in view of its rich human and material potential and the  progress that it has achieved in the march of reconstruction.  He stressed the importance of promoting Iraqi-French relations  in the service of the two countries' common interests.     "

Slain GIA Members Identified      The 28 February edition of EL WATAN reported that GIA leader Si  Ahmed Mourad, known as El-Afghani, and IO GIA members were killed by  police forces in Bouzareah.  According to EL WATAN, among the GIA  members killed were Rachid Djabri, Beraf ta Aissa, Daas, and  Lounici; the others have not yet been identified.  (LIBERTE of 28  February reported that Aissa's death has not yet been confirmed.)      EL WATAN reported the following biographical information on the  GIA members:      Si Ahmed Mourad, a 29-year-old Afghan veteran living in Kouba,  had been condemned to death in absentia by the Algier's Special  Court.  Mourad was reportedly responsible for several  assassinations, as well as numerous crimes attributed to the GIA.  Mourad, Beraf ta Aissa, Rachid Djabri, and Buezmir Mohamed were said  to have been behind the October kidnapping of three French Consulate  employees.  Five GIA members were killed in the operation, although  Mourad, Aissa, Djabri, and Mohamed escaped.  Mohamed was later  killed by police.  (According to the 1 March edition of LIBERTE,  Mourad was also known as ""Seif Ellah"" (""Sayf Allah"").)      Berafta Aissa, 35, and Rachid Djabri, 29, were both residents of  Algiers.  An arrest warrant had been issued for their involvement in  several murders and other crimes in the Algiers region.  Daas had  reportedly been GIA head in Bouzareah and was wanted for several  murders.      Reaction to Slaying of GIA Members      According to an article in EL WATAN of 28 February, the slaying  of the GIA members on 27 February was not only ""a brilliant success  for the forces of order but also a significant blow to the  organization and structure of the terrorist groups.""  The deaths of  El-Afghani and his followers, considered ""the bloodiest and the most  radical of the fundamentalist armed groups within the terrorist  movement,"" was viewed as a ""decisive turning point"" in a three-year  struggle against ""terrorism.""  According to EL WATAN, it is  ""reasonable to think that a considerable slakening"" in GIA activity  can be expected, although the paper did not rule out retaliatory  acts by surviving group members.  El-Afghani's refusal to support  dialogue between the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and the  government made his wing of the GIA a ""serious barrier to dialogue.""  Now, according to EL WATAN, ""his disappearance should logically open  channels for dialogue.""  Given the GIA's threats under El-Afghani to  kill all Islamists who engaged in any kind of negotiations with the  government, EL WATAN asserted that his death was probably a priority  and a prerequisite for any negotiations between the FIS and the  government.      An article in the 28 February LIBERTE interpreted the police  operation as an indication that Algerian President Liamine Zeroual  is ""determined"" to combat violence:  ""The successful attack  demonstrated that the authorities not only had the intention of not  easing up on armed groups, but when necessary also had the means to  attack 'terrorism'.""  According to the article, the incident will  ""have a great effect on government-FIS negotiations,"" given El-  Afghani's resistence to dialogue.  However, the LIBERTE article also  predicted that the government would harden its position that  eradicating violence is of primary importance.  The article also  speculates that the government is still in the process of ""getting  back on its feet"" after having recently appointed a new president.      New GIA Leadership; Organizational Structure      Sayah Attia has replaced Mourad Si Ahmed as chief of the GIA,  according to Paris daily LE FIGARO of 9 March.  Algiers daily EL  WATAN of 1 March reported that Attia's group is one of three  operating outside of Algiers under the name of the ""Armed Islamic  Group.""      Sayah Attia, the son of a ""Harki"", operates in Medea, Ksar El  Boukhari, and Tissemsilt, according to EL WATAN.  The newspaper  calls him a ""bloodthirsty"" individual who prefers hand-to-hand  fighting.  He reportedly leads a ""commando"" of armed criminals,  which is said to have committed over 200 ""savage"" terrorist acts.  Attia is reportedly responsible for 132 assassinations, and 283 acts  of aggression and vandalism.  Security services have identified him  as the ringleader in the killing of 12 Croats in December, as well  as an attack on an official motorcade in Tissemsilt that killed 10  and a 1993 attack on the Boughezoul military barracks.  ALGER  REPUBLICAIN of 8 March reported that Attia returned to Afghanistan  in 1989 with Saudi assistance.  After staying in Afghanistan three  years, he re-entered Algeria clandestinely in November 1992.  Attia  is the father of six children, and recently took a 14-year-old as  his second wife.      Khaled Sehili heads the second ""Armed Islamic Group"" which  operates in Blida, El-Affroun, Chrea, and Boufarik, according to EL  WATAN.  Sehili is reportedly responsible for the slaying of at least  SO police officers and nearly 150 acts of sabotage.  He is also  reportedly responsible for an ambush which killed about 12 military  personnel last September in Chrea.      Kada Benchiha, also the son of a ""Harki"", heads the third ""Armed  Islamic Group"" which operates in Sidi Bel-Abbes.  The group is  composed of about 20 ""elements"" who reportedly easily slip through  police blockades and escape from police sweeps in the region.  Benchiha is reportedly responsible for the assassination of two  French surveyors last September and for a fire at ENIE in Sidi Bel-  Abbes last August.

He was introduced to us  as one of the commanders of the `Red Star' brigades that operate  against the Israeli occupation. He promised us to speak plainly  and with figures. The following conversation with him took place.    Settlers Among Our Targets    [AL-HURRIYAH] Yesterday an Egged bus belonging to settlers  near Hebron; before it a group of settlers near al-Birah; before  that Rabbi Druckman and the settler (Ephraim Ayyubi). Why have  settlers now become a target of Red Star?    [Commander H.M.] Druckman is a leader of the extremist  settlers, a former Knesset member, and a founder of the  pro-settlement Gush Emunim. The settlers near al-Birah were  among those responsible for killing the Palestinian student Rami  al-Ghazzawi from al-Birah. The Egged bus was the transportation  link between the settlement of Qiryat Arba' and Beersheba. They  all fit into one context.    Whoever wants to chase the settlers from his land must fight  them. The settlers will remain among our targets because they  form the nucleus of colonial occupation and the reserve for  military occupation. They run rampant as if they were masters of  the land and we, their slaves, while the occupation army stands  silent. They have mistreated our people, slain our sons,  terrified our women and children, and attacked our property.  They must leave this land at any cost. We have heard the whole  world, with Yasir 'Arafat in its forefront, denounce the killing  of the Israeli settler Hayyim Mizrahi and condemn the Fatah  youths who carried out the heroic operation against the settler  Mizrahi. This frightens no one, so much as it proves to us that  we are on the right path. We don't think the occupation needs a  pretext for repressing the people and throwing our sons into  prison. We are in a state of war with the occupation. We don't  think that laying down our arms will provide us with safety.  Safety will be provided by the departure of the occupation and  the settlers from our land.    Big Collaborators, Small Collaborators    [AL-HURRIYAH] Compared with others in the field of  operations  to liquidate collaborators, you have the smallest number. What  is the reason?    [Commander H.M.] The Red Star forces believe that every  collaborator must meet his just desserts. They certainly are not  lenient with collaborators, who harm many fighters and cause a  large number of them to be killed by the soldiers of the  occupation. Nevertheless, we in Red Star want to exercise care  in dealing with collaborators and distinguish between ""big  heads"" and ""little heads."" We think that punishing the big one  is more useful than punishing the little one. Punishing big ones  can serve as a lesson to the little ones. The little ones can be  deterred by warning and by putting them under house arrest and  surveillance. The big ones have passed the point of no return  and must receive their punishment.    We make a decision about a collaborator only after gathering  a sufficient amount of information, documents, and even pictures  that prove his guilt. [passage omitted]    [AL-HURRIYAH] The media has carried sensational accounts of  the way in which you carried out the resolution to execute  [alleged collaborator] Ahmad 'Awdah. How was it done?    [Commander H.M.] We wanted to use the same weapon with which  'Awdah used to threaten the members of our people. He always  used to carry his pistol at his side. We commissioned two of our  comrades, who watched him until the right moment came. They  grabbed the pistol from him and opened fire on him. So we also  won over the gun in the service of our work against the Israeli  occupiers.    Unfair, Unfounded Charges    [AL-HURRIYAH] One force recently published a letter saying  that you laid claim to operations that their fighters carried  out, such as the operation against Rabbi Druckman, or the one  against the settlers' car in al-Birah, or even the one against  the customs bureau in Jerusalem.    [Commander H.M.] First, I would remind you that we could  have  used the same method that this group used in distributing  letters and issuing communiques about the double claims to  certain military operations against the Israeli occupation and  settlers' livestock. But we preferred to remain silent, knowing  well that this kind of information war is not in the interest of  the intifadah or of those who wish to oppose the occupation. Our  interest, besides escalating our operations, is to work to  mobilize forces and join ranks.    Nevertheless, I can make a few quick observations.    This group charges that we claimed responsibility for the  operation that set fire to a customs office in the center of  Jerusalem, whereas a unit belonging to that group carried it out.    Unfortunately, the information is wrong. If it indicates  anything, it indicates the truth of our position, our  information, and our statements, and the falseness of the  others' information and statements. On 23 October 1992, we  announced our responsibility for setting fire to the customs  warehouses, not a customs office, in the 'Atrot district in the  heart of an industrial area in one of Jerusalem's suburbs, not  in the center of Jerusalem proper, as the statement of this  group says. Perhaps the person who drafted this statement,  claiming to belong to the field of armed action, has no  connection to armed action. I think my comrades in arms in the  strike forces and armed groups are well aware and will agree  with me that the operation against the Israeli customs  warehouses was carried out only by Red Star's Martyr Ahmad  al-Kilani group.    As for the Burqin operation near Nablus, which, according to  this communique, targeted an Israeli military vehicle, I wish  the author of the communique would show me a statement issued by  Red Star about the operation. We did not claim responsibility  for the operation because we never carried it out.    Regarding the operation against Rabbi Druckman, it was  followed by the operation against settlers near al-Birah and the  number 51 Egged bus operation near Hebron.    The force that issued the communique claimed responsibility  for the first two operations, but not for the bus. Military  observers commented that the bus operation was implemented in  the same manner as the Druckman and al-Birah operations. We do  not want testimony from military observers. Although, thank God,  we lost none of our comrades in all these operations to capture  or martyrdom, we are always concerned that no one claim our  struggles and sacrifices for himself.    Two vivid examples come to mind. They provide sufficient  proof.    On 29 March 1984, DFLP [Democratic Front for the Liberation  of Palestine] forces carried out a Land Day operation in the  heart of Jerusalem. Although some heroic members of the group  were captured or killed, one of the other groups claimed the  operation for itself. Later it was forced to retract the claim  because of irrefutable facts. That is one example.    Another example is the operation that targeted the settler  Hayyim Mizrahi. The other group claimed responsibility for it by  notarized communiques, but we discovered afterward that those  who had carried it out were a group of Fatah youths who rejected  their leaders' decision to halt the intifadah. I think these two  examples are sufficient, without citing operations by the heroes  of Islamic Jihad's Sword of Islam group for which others claimed  responsibility despite the death of martyrs who everyone knew  belonged to Islamic Jihad.

Li Lanqing, CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau member and State Council vice  premier; Wang Bingquan, National People's Congress Standing  Committee vice chairman; and Wan Guoquan, Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference National Committee vice  chairman; met with 207 representatives and had a picture taken  with them.    While meeting with the representatives, Li Lanqing said: It  is my great pleasure to meet you, representatives of advanced  self-employed workers, and to congratulate you on the honor you  have received. As is known, a socialist market economy consists  of various economic sectors, with public ownership as the  mainstay. It is a long-term national policy to encourage them  to compete on equal terms, promote each other, and develop  simultaneously. In recent years, individually owned and  privately owned economic sectors have developed vigorously  mainly because of, first, the party's opening up policy and,  second, the hardworking pioneering spirit and diligent labor of  individual workers. They have played an important role in  promoting economic development, which is obvious to all.  Individual workers should run their businesses according to the  law, develop their undertakings through honest labor and  managerial expertise, and contribute to China's economic  development. It is hoped that they will always remember the  Chinese virtue of using one's fortune to help others, and will  lead local people to achieve common prosperity. Meanwhile, we  should advocate the spirit of readily helping others and donate  funds to promote educational undertakings.    Li Lanqing said: Among self-employed workers, there are  heroes and models, in addition to outstanding entrepreneurs.  One of the representatives commended at the current meeting is  an individual worker from Zhejiang who was burned and injured  while trying to put out a fire. People are touched by his  heroic deeds. We hope that other workers will bring into play  his self-sacrificing spirit and make joint efforts to further  develop economic and achieve fruitful results in building  spiritual civilization.    In his speech, Wang Bingqian said: Individually run and  privately run economic sectors are placing an increasingly  conspicuous role in promoting production, bringing about social  prosperity, enlivening circulation, making things more  convenient for everyday life, providing employment, and  safeguarding social stability. At present, there are some 17.6  million individually run industrial and commercial units  employing a total of over 29 million people. They have formed  an important and indispensable force in China's socialist  construction. Engaged in honorable undertakings, individual  workers should be protected by the state laws, recognized by  society, and respected by the people.    The meeting was sponsored by the Communist Youth League  Central Committee, the State Industry and Commerce  Administration, and the China Association of Self-Employed  Workers.     "

The press statement by Comrade Pak Song-chol, member of the  WPK Central Committee Political Bureau and vice president of the  DPRK says:    Our people--who embrace the historic New Year's address made  by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, the great sun  of the nation and the lodestar of the fatherland's  reunification, ringing in the hopeful New Year, 1994, with  boundless gratitude and excitement--are filled with firm resolve  and confidence to effect a new revolutionary upsurge in  socialist construction and expedite the cause for reunifying the  fatherland independently under the party's wise leadership in  this year.    In his New Year's address, the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, summing up last year, noted that the officers and men  of our heroic People's Army and all the people, in hearty  response to the party's militant call, stood up as one man in  the struggle to brilliantly adorn last year's Third Seven-Year  Plan and to defend the country's sovereignty and revolutionary  achievements with an unshakable confidence in victory and in  soaring spirits, foiled the enemy's challenge and aggressive  scheme and honorably safeguarded the dignity and security of  their socialist fatherland.    The great leader, in this year in which socialist  construction enters a new stage of development, expounded the  glorious tasks of consolidating and developing the achievements  already made in the revolution and construction and achieving  new and greater (?achievements) so as to further add luster to  the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style.    In particular, touching on our party and the Republic  government's sincere efforts made in the last year to open a way  for the fatherland's reunification with the nation's united  strength, the great leader clarified our party's principled  position as regards to the fatherland's reunification.    Convinced that our party's principled position regarding the  fatherland's reunification elucidated in the great leader's  historic New Year's address is a programmatic guideline for  breaking the deadlock lying in the way of the reunification and  triumphantly accomplishing the cause for reunifying the  fatherland with the nation's self-reliant force, I fervently  support and welcome this.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: We must  accomplish the cause of national reunification as soon as  possible, so as to meet the unanimous, ardent desire of the  entire nation and hand down the reunified country to our  posterity.    Our nation was not only forced to experience the tragedy of  separation by outside forces but also could not fulfill our  nation's ardent aspiration to reunify the fatherland up until  now due to the outside forces' stubborn maneuvers aimed at  obstruction.    This shows that our country's reunification issue can only  be resolved through our nation's own strength, rejecting the  interference of outside forces, and that holding fast to the  nation's principle of independence is a fundamental issue for  the fatherland's reunification. Proceeding from this, we put  forward a 10-point program of the great unity of the whole  nation for the reunification of the fatherland last year and  made all-out efforts to pave the road for reunification by means  of unified strength and our nation's own strength.    The 10-point program set forth by the great leader is an  immortal banner of the national unity to transcend differences  in ideology, ideals, and systems, and a great charter for the  reunification of the fatherland, which embodies the noble desire  of our 70 million compatriots to realize the reunification and  prosperity of our nation with a long history of 5,000 years.    We hoped the South Korean authorities would take the road of  reconciliation and cooperation in response to our 10-point  program of great national unity and, out of aspiration for  national unity and reunification, we also took important steps  for an exchange of top-level special envoys between the two  sides. However, the South Korean authorities have clung to  dependence on foreign forces, not national independence, and  committed anti-national acts of further aggravating  confrontation between the North and South, not national unity,  by ignoring our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the  entire nation for reunification. They have staged successive  large-scale military exercises against our Republic frequently  in collusion with foreign forces and have committed  anti-republic maneuvers more viciously than their predecessors  by clamoring for military countermeasures and an international  cooperation system based on the pretext of our nonexistent  nuclear issue.    Worse still, they suspended the North-South dialogues and  exchanges, which had been pushed ahead even by the Fifth and  Sixth Republics, and brutally suspended the patriotic forces for  reunification. Last year, the new rulers of South Korea came  out with a so-called step-by-step reunification [tangyejok  tongil], which already had been at the nation's center of  criticism, made the North-South relations retreat, and darkened  the prospect for the reunification of the fatherland.    The current South Korean rulers, through their acts, clearly  disclosed that the so-called civilian regime is only a disguise;  in fact it does not differ from the successive military  dictatorial regimes. Even though the current South Korean ruler  loudly advertised civilian politics and reform policies, the  National Security Law, the evil anti-communist fascist laws, and  the Agency for National Security Planning and the Defense of  Security command, which are suppressive agencies, still remain  intact in South Korea. Due to the fascist politics dominated by  public security, none of the desires of the South Korean people  for independence, democracy, and national reunification has been  fulfilled.    It is very natural that the South Korean people and figures  in various classes and strata are waging an antigovernment  struggle today, saying there is no need to further watch the  current regime, and expect nothing from it.    Regarding our nuclear issue that the United States and its  followers are talking about, the great leader taught in his New  Year's address that the issue is a product of the antisocialist,  anti-republic maneuver that the United States pursues  persistently.    As the respected and beloved leader taught, it was the  United  States that raised the suspicion of nonexistent nuclear  development of the North, and it is also the United States that  threatens us after actually drawing nuclear weapons on the  Korean peninsula.    Accordingly, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  should  be resolved peacefully through negotiations between the  offender, who poses the nuclear threat, and its victim, in other  words, between our Republic and the United States.    Any pressure or threat will not work on us. To adhere to  such a method cannot resolve the issue, but will only bring the  grave result of driving the situation into a catastrophe  [paguk]. The United States should take a good look at all the  facts and act discreetly. Under the condition that the  DPRK-U.S. joint declaration has been signed, the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula will be resolved fairly if both sides  abide by and implement the principles agreed upon.    In his New Year's address, the great leader stressed that  our  Republic's principle and line for the fatherland's reunification  never changes, and made it clear that we will make every effort  to achieve the reunification of the country in a way of a  confederal system based on one nation, one country, two systems,  and two governments, according to the three principles of  independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national  unity.    This principled position clarified by the great leader  clearly expresses the firm will of our party and the government  of the Republic to hasten the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country in accordance with all the people's  desire and intent, no matter how the situation develops.    As the great leader elucidated in his New Year's address,  the  principled position of our party and the government of the  Republic regarding the fatherland's reunification, a brilliant  road has indeed opened for us to vigorously accelerate the cause  of the fatherland's reunification by overcoming difficulties in  the course of reunification.    Our party and the government of the Republic will make every  effort to realize the cause of fatherland's reunification in the  nineties under the banner of the 10-point program of the great  unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the  fatherland presented by the great leader. It is the destiny of  the fatherland, the nation, and all our people at home and  abroad.    I fervently appeal to the 70 million compatriots in the  North, the South, and overseas, who love the country and the  nation, to launch vigorously into the nationwide struggle to  realize the fatherland's reunification based on the confederal  system, firmly united as one under the banner of the 10-point  program of the great unity of the whole nation for the  reunification of the fatherland and upholding the policy on the  fatherland's reunification that the great leader elucidated in  his New Year's address.    I also expect the progressive people of the world, who value  justice and peace, to completely support and encourage the  Korean people's struggle for the country's reunification.     "

[passage omitted]    The brother chairman of the Presidential Council spoke at  the  meeting, expressing his thanks and gratitude for the high  national unionist spirit demonstrated by the sons of Yafi'  District, the heroic strugglers who have shown true belonging to  the homeland and faith in unity. He noted that the secessionist  rebels, led by the traitor and agent al-Bid, have imposed  challenges on unity by their plots and pursuit of their  destructive selfish interests.    He said the broad national support for the Armed Forces,  which are defending unity and legitimacy, demonstrated by the  sons of the Yemeni people all over the Yemeni homeland, is a  sincere expression of the meaning of unity for our people.  Unity means pride, dignity, existence, and the fate for all  Yemenis. It is not possible to imagine the present and future  of Yemen without unity. The masses of our people have zealously  and eagerly stood up for unity to bolster it, baptizing it with  the pure blood and the precious sacrifices of the sons of our  people and their Armed Forces in order to preserve and maintain  unity.    He added that unity deserves all sacrifices. Our people are  willing to make more sacrifices and they will defend their  unity, even if they have to use stones if weapons are not  available. They will uphold the slogan of unity or death.    The brother president praised the stands of the sons of the  Yafi' District, who have valiantly confronted the gang of  secession and rebellion and defeated it in more than one  location. The sons of Yafi' have proven to be strong strugglers  who are loyal to principles and to the homeland's causes and  unity.    He said our people are today formulating a new history in  their life and effort to make a prosperous, stable future which  cannot be imagined without unity. He pointed out that our  struggling Yemeni people, who have been hardened by experience,  have championed their will all along and are today capable of  defeating this new challenge imposed by the criminal  secessionist gang on unity. The Yemeni people will emerge  victorious, God willing, because the will of the people derives  from the will of God. He said all efforts will be mobilized in  the next stage to repair and reconstruct what has been destroyed  by the war imposed by the secessionists on the homeland and to  build a new Yemen based on unity, democracy, comprehensive  development, broad popular participation, building modern  institutions, establishing law and order, respecting human  rights and social justice.    The meeting was attended by brother Yahya al-Ra'i, member of  the House of Representatives.     "

How can such acts of violence be  prevented?    [Al-Tibi] Only by implementing the peace agreement. Even  though things will not become completely peaceful then, the acts  of violence will at least be reduced.    [Albrecht] Yesterday, it seemed that the peace negotiations  would be continued now. Is this still true?    [Al-Tibi] The PLO Executive Committee is currently  discussing how things are going to continue after the latest  crime.    [Albrecht] You call it a crime.    [Al-Tibi] Yes, it is a crime. It is just a continuation of  the Hebron massacre. First, Baruch Goldstein shot 30 people.  Then, during the following eight days, the Israeli military  shot 30 Palestinians. And now another six Palestinians were  killed. It will be very difficult to continue the peace talks  this week.    [Albrecht] What is your demand to the Israelis?    [Al-Tibi] They should stop killing us. They should make  sure that the atmosphere changes and they finally see us as  human beings.    [Albrecht] Do you trust Rabin, who is defense minister and  prime minister at the same time?    [Al-Tibi] Defense Minister Rabin is hurting the peace  efforts of Prime Minister Rabin.    [Albrecht] How, do you think, did this most recent shooting  of Palestinians come about?    [Al-Tibi] The only reason that can be behind that is that  there was an order to stage a massacre. If the Israeli military  goes to the refugee camps, it does so only for one specific  reason. In addition, these soldiers were not normal military.  They were a special unit that went in to shoot people. Who  gave the order to go to the refugee camp one day before the  continuation of the talks?    [Albrecht] A few days ago you were still optimistic about  the peace process. You spoke of ""historic changes"" and of the  ""mutual recognition of the two peoples.""    [Al-Tibi] Yes, I was naively optimistic.    [Albrecht] Why?    [Al-Tibi] Because we were very close to an interim solution  after the massacre in Hebron. Nevertheless, I am sure that, in  the end, we will implement the peace agreement.    [Albrecht] The trust of the Palestinians in their leadership  is constantly decreasing. While the leadership wants to  continue the peace talks, the people at the grassroots demand  not to continue negotiations.    [Al-Tibi] Yes, I just had a telephone call from Gaza. I was  asked to tell 'Arafat that he should stop the peace talks.  However, there is no alternative to the peace process. Of  course, our credibility has suffered. The Palestinians still do  not see any change or improvement. I am sure that at the moment  when the agreement comes into force and when the Palestinians  see that the Israeli military withdraws, the support for peace  will be there again. I know my people.

The government had taken a number of major steps to  ensure the public would be able to vote as safely as possible  over the next three days    He said the government condemned the bombings in the  strongest possible terms. ""It must be stated quite  categorically that, despite these evil acts of terrorism, South  Africans will vote on April 26, 27 and 28,"" he said. ""I would  like to assure the public that the government, the SAP [South  African Police] and other security forces will not fail in their  duty to safeguard the transition to a democracy in South Africa.""    The SAP had already offered R1 million [rand] for  information  leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.    Steps taken to promote voting safety included:     -  immediate nationwide cordon and search operations by the  SA Police and other security forces to reduce the chances of  further bomb blasts and other atrocities;    -  more than 100,000 police would be deployed to ensure the  safety  of polling booths and stations throughout South Africa;    -  in the largest peace-time call-up yet in South Africa  thousands  of SA Defence Force members would be deployed to assist the SAP  safeguard the election process; and    -  implementation of contingency planning to deal with the  situation.       Mr Myburgh said no police force in the world could guarantee  that acts of terrorism would not take place, ""but I would like  to state quite clearly that the SAP and other security forces  can and will ensure that the election process as a whole is not  derailed"".    ""I therefore urge the public to stay calm and to fully  co-operate with the security forces in their task of ensuring  that the election process is not derailed.""    Mr Myburgh said he would like to express his and the  government's condolences to the family and friends of the  victims of all the bomb blasts.    Answering questions, he said it seemed quite logical that  there was a pattern in the bombings, but he could not comment at  this stage on who police thought might be behind it. The police  had assigned their most competent detectives to the  investigation.    The explosive devices used in the blasts had been home-made,  but were professional in the sense that they ""did detonate"".  There was no indication that any grouping like a third force  had been involved.    On election precautions, he said ballots and voting  stations,  at which police would be deployed, would be closely guarded as  routes to them. Polling stations were to be checked out the day  before voting and closely guarded right until the last person  had left at the end of the voting. The same measures as in the  past were being taken to protect political personalities.     "

At a news conference in Cairo today, he said he discussed  the  situation in Rwanda with President Husni Mubarak during their  meeting today. He said he appealed to the president to use his  influence and relations to end the war.    He also urged the international community to intervene to  stop the fighting and persuade all sides to abandon arms so that  the people of Rwanda can be convinced to halt the war. [passage  omitted]    Mugenzi said his country has been in a state of war for four  years, during which the number of refugees and displaced inside  the country rose from 400,000 people to 1 million. With a  population of 7 million people, there is one refugee for every  seven people in Rwanda, he said. [passage omitted]    On the security situation in Rwanda, Mugenzi explained that  the government is doing all it can to restore stability and calm  to a country where people are dominated by a spirit of revenge.  The government expresses regret for the victims of violence and  is doing everything in its power to stop this bloody human  tragedy, he said.    He said the conflict has gone beyond all rational  boundaries,  and the war has turned into a tribal and ethnic one. It is  difficult to control a people willing to apply their own law of  revenge and ones who are confident that their primary enemy is  the Patriotic Front and its Tutsi tribes, he said. This is the  reason for the violence in the country, he added.    He regretted and condemned the killings in his country and  called on the people to demonstrate patience and leave the  government to do its job.    On reports that the Belgian forces operating within the UN  peace- keeping force are involved in Rwanda's incidents,  Minister Mugenzi expressed his country's ""anxiety"" [ta'azzum]  over the conduct of the Belgian forces. He said: Our relations  with Belgium have until recently been extremely good. We do not  blame the Belgian Government for the acts of some personnel, and  we believe those are individual acts.    He said Rwanda is concerned about the conduct of the Belgian  forces. Since they set foot in the capital Kigali, he said,  they have been engaged in suspect acts with support from the  Patriotic Front. We warned those forces against this conduct,  and officials apologized for some incidents, he said.    He added: We clearly say that many members of these Belgian  forces cooperate with the Patriotic Front. They were placed in  strategic positions and several armed battles have taken place  between them and the government forces in Rwanda, resulting in  many victims.    He said his country demanded withdrawal of those forces, and  the necessary measures for this withdrawal have already been  taken. The forces reached the border and this is satisfactory,  he said.

This is why not a  year passes without the Islamic Republic being listed among the  world's bloodthirsty and arbitrary regimes and without its being  criticized on a world level.    Some of the most heart-rending crimes by this regime are  perpetrated against combatants who disagree with the clergymen  and are opponents of the regime. During the 15 years of the  regime's existence, hundreds of Iranian citizens have been  thrown into the torture chambers of the Islamic Republic because  of their political beliefs and have received long prison terms,  while thousands have received the death penalty.    Here we do not intend to refer to all these crimes and to  the  inhuman acts that have become ordinary in the dungeons of the  Islamic Republic. These crimes have been revealed on many  occasions. Revelations have been made of heart-rending acts  such as the mass murder of political prisoners, extortion,  depriving them of the right to a lawyer, summary trials, rape of  girls before their execution, dozens of kinds of psychological  and physical tortures, and leaving the world uninformed of the  situation of the political prisoners and so on by presenting no  documentary proof. Actually very few are unaware that all types  of crimes have been perpetrated in clerical Iran against  political prisoners. Thus, in this article we intend to only  list the duties that the families and relatives of the political  prisoners, our country's masses, opposition parties and  organizations, and world humanitarian groups and organizations  have toward these political prisoners.    If we accept the fact that the struggle against dictatorship  and strangulation is a holy mission--and we do--and if we  believe in the fact that the Islamic Republic is the  full-fledged enemy of human rights and freedoms and the  strangler of these rights and freedoms--and we do--both we,  those who live in Iran and face the bullying and arbitrariness  of the clerical regime, and the humanitarian circles and  organizations and, in general, progressive humanity, the human  values and criteria of which the Islamic Republic is ridiculing,  we will have certain duties to perform as far as the political  prisoners in Iran are concerned.    We would first like to list the duties of the families and  relatives of the political prisoners. We know that for some  time now the clerical regime has wanted to pretend that there is  no such thing as a political prisoner in Iran and that the  combatants who are under arrest have been cast into prison on  charges of ordinary crimes. For this reason, the relatives and  families of the political prisoners should use every possible  means to contact opposition organizations and to give them any  information that they have on their dear imprisoned ones such as  their name, age, educational background, profession, political  activities and stands, the date and place of their arrest, and  whatever they know about their trial. They should try to hand  over the necessary information and documents on their imprisoned  relative to representatives of the Human Rights Commission and  Amnesty International when they visit Iran. If possible, they  should make their voices heard by the foreign mass media and by  those humanitarian organizations and groups that are ready to  reveal the crimes perpetrated by the Iranian rulers.    Many of these duties do not concern only the families and  relatives of the political prisoners. Each and every  respectable and sensitive person should consider himself a  next-of-kin of the political prisoners and to consider it his  duty to inform the people and political forces of Iran, as well  as the world, of the situation the imprisoned freedom-lovers are  in. The duty that our country's masses have in relation with  this is even heavier. While revealing these crimes and giving  the necessary information to the competent circles, they should  also be active in another field. They should become a backbone  and a mouthpiece for those families who are facing numerous  psychological and material problems because their daughter, son,  or the head of the family has been arrested. The more the masses  sympathize with the families of the political prisoners and  strive to remove their problems, the more they will be resisting  the executioners and the prouder they will defend their demands  which are the demands of the majority of the people in our  country as well.    A political prisoner should feel that if he has welcomed  torture and death for the sake of fulfilling the demands and the  freedoms of the people of the country, the people too are  appreciative, and they are not indifferent toward their families  and their sacrifices. More important yet, our compatriots should  organize protest movements related to the political prisoners  and demand that the regime end their behind-the-scene trials,  publish the number of political prisoners and a report on the  true situation of the prisoners, allow political prisoners to  meet with their families and relatives on a regular basis,  provide suitable health and food facilities, and allow them  access to radios and newspapers, and the books that they wish to  read. All the staged acts that the Islamic Republic of Iran is  carrying out in connection with the political prisoners should  be neutralized, and especially when representatives of  organizations defending human rights come to Iran to assess the  situation of human rights, our compatriots should try to  organize antiregime protests and to inform these representatives  of the dire situation that the political prisoners in Iran are  facing.    Iran's political forces that are engaged in a struggle  against the regime should inform world public opinion of all the  documents and information that they acquire through their  members and supporters and through the people of our country in  connection with the political prisoners. Many of these forces  have some sort of propaganda means such as radio stations,  newspapers, and so on. Therefore, while publishing such  information and documentation, they should pay more attention to  directing and encouraging the masses of our country and to  further informing them of the duties that they have toward the  political prisoners.    During the past few years, all the antiregime forces have  strived to inform the world abroad of the situation of the  political prisoners in Iran. Undoubtedly, if there is more  cooperation and coordination among the opposition organizations  and personalities and if a common plan is laid out, their  efforts and the activities in this field will be more widely  reflected and there will be more solidarity than is seen on the  global level today.    Until now, Amnesty International, the Middle East Watch, the  Human Rights Commission, the UN General Assembly, and many other  world pro-human rights groups and organizations have revealed  the unprecedented crimes that the Islamic Republic of Iran has  perpetrated and is perpetrating against the political prisoners.  But the repeated condemnation of the Islamic Republic by these  organizations and groups has not put an end to the massacre of  political prisoners in Iran or, at least, helped to bring about  a major development in relation to them. One of the reasons for  this is that the governments of the world have not attached  great importance to the views and stands of pro-human rights  organizations on the Islamic Republic and, ignoring the  antipopular nature of this regime, they have continued their  political-economic relations and cooperation with the Islamic  Republic.    It is by taking these facts into consideration that  pro-human  rights organizations and all sources, forces, and personalities  who consider their struggle against the massacre of  freedom-seekers in Iran to be their humanitarian duty should  mobilize world public opinion and place governments under  pressure to stop transactions and cooperation with the Islamic  Republic, and to isolate this regime in the world on charges of  fighting against freedom and crushing freedom-lovers.    We hope that everyone will help to serve the political  prisoners of Iran.     "

By STEVE APPLEFORD, Appleford is a Granada Hills writer.      Local rockers will soon face a panel of music industry types, pop celebrities  and other characters in an effort to leap from club-level obscurity at FM  Station's ""Pure Rock Search '90.""    Expected judges of the nine-week battle of the bands, which will benefit  Children of the Night, include comic Sam Kinison and members of the  chart-topping hard rock bands Poison and Warrant.    The contest, which begins Tuesday and continues Tuesday nights through Sept.  11, has found a surprising degree of support from virtually every level of the  music industry, said Susette Andres, booking secretary at the North Hollywood  nightclub. Members of popular rock acts were quick to sign on as judges. And  several donations have been received for the contest's grand prize of drums, a  Gibson electric guitar, amplifiers and other stage gear.    Both new and journeyman bands are invited to enter by submitting a tape of any  listenable quality, whether recorded live in a garage or in a pristine  professional multitrack studio. As many as 400 entries are expected by the  final deadline of July 29, Andres said. And all finalists will appear on a live  cassette recorded on the contest's last night.    Andres said early entries included some of the top Sunset Strip bands.    ""I was surprised they'd even enter. Usually they have the attitude that they're  already going to get signed. It's cool,"" he said.    All proceeds from the $5 admission and sales of the live cassette will go to  Children of the Night, a rescuer of teen-age runaways. Contest co-sponsor  KNAC-FM, the Long Beach-based hard rock station, is a longtime supporter and  holds an annual concert and auction that this year raised about $75,000 for the  organization.    ""We're just thrilled with having the support of the people who know what the  kids are going through,"" said Lois Lee, founder of Children of the Night. ""I  think the musicians often get a bad rap of exploiting these kids. And this  gives them an opportunity to help these kids that they can't reach in any other  way.""    The mission of Children of the Night, Lee said, is to find runaway youngsters  in Los Angeles who during their search for stardom end up on the street,  addicted to drugs or supporting themselves through prostitution. But through  shelter and counseling, many runaways are eventually guided back home or to  independence with jobs and apartments.    Money generated from ""Pure Rock Search '90"" will help pay for the charity's  annual $62,000 food budget and the renovation of its shelter building in Van  Nuys, which is expected to open by December.    ""A lot of these teens are KNAC listeners, and a lot of them hang out on the  Strip,"" said Pam Edwards, KNAC's program director. ""We just thought we could  relate to them and get the message out that there is a place where they can go  and get off the street.""    The music industry has long rallied around the organization, now the subject of  pop-rock singer Richard Marx's Top 20 single, ""Children of the Night."" Tom  Maher, promotion director for KNAC, said he is hoping to raise as much as  $15,000 for the charity through the contest and cassette. He added that the  total could go much higher through unexpected large donations. He said such  donations often result from the music scene's more charitable impulses.    ""It's really interesting the way people respond,"" Maher said. ""We're just  trying to have fun, give something to charity and get some attention to these  bands.""    At FM Station, Andres said one motive for the contest was to simply expose some  of the acts that have played at the North Hollywood club, which in recent  months has become a busy center of activity on the local rock scene. ""We have a  lot of good bands that play here,"" she said. ""And we wanted to put it all  together on one big album.""    Each week's contest will have its own panel of record industry people and  celebrities, judging the best among five competitors. Andres said audience  reaction will count as one vote.    Master of ceremonies will be KNAC radio personality Craig Williams, who hosts  the station's ""Pure Rock Local Show,"" which spotlights unsigned local groups.  Those who appear on the contest's cassette will likely be played on that  program. And the grand-prize winner might be added to the station's regular  music rotation, Edwards said.    ""To the bands it means exposure,"" she said. ""And there is a certain amount of  prestige in winning. It gives their fans a chance to come out and root for  them.""    For other competitors, she added, the contest will give emerging acts a rare  opportunity to perform. ""For some of these bands, it will be one of their first  gigs. I think the Strip bands will have an edge because of their fans and name  recognition. But if a new group is a good solid band with good stage presence,  they should do well, absolutely.""    The ""Pure Rock Search '90"" cassette, scheduled for release in late September,  will be distributed through Tempo Records stores, a co-sponsor that is  accepting contest entries. Also accepting entries is another sponsor, the ABK  Rocks music store in Sepulveda.

[passage omitted] Brothers and sisters, the  peace and blessing of God be upon you. First of all I express  thanks to you all, participants in this glorious meeting held on  the initiative of all social organizations. Undoubtedly our  persecuted and heroic nation more urgently needs peace now than  at any other time. We must try and join hands so that peace  may be restored throughout our beloved country. Our nation  should no longer suffer from difficulties and from the fighting  with which it is confronted now. Of course, we all know who  started this fighting and whose hands are involved in causing  the fighting to flare up in our country. We all know what sorts  of conspiracy are under way on the other side of our borders,  and we all know the evil intention behind them. Despite all  these conspiracies guided from outside, it is our religious and  national duty and mission to work hard, day and night, to end  the fighting and to resort to all possible means at our  disposal.    As far as the Islamic State of Afghanistan is concerned, the  state has declared its righteous strategy for the restoration of  peace. The Islamic State, in most difficult situations, has  given a positive reply to the message of peace from wherever it  comes. We have been saying this all along, and we emphasize it  again -- fighting is not the way to solve the issues. We are  now witness to the fact that our people in the capital and  provinces have embarked on a broad-scale endeavor to prevent the  fighting. We have seen that a large number of governors,  commanders, and esteemed figures have come to the capital from  various regions of our country and have expressed readiness for  the solution of issues. Once again our people and the people of  the world are waiting to see what actual steps we will take for  the solution of the present difficulties and how we will resolve  the problems we are facing. The Islamic State recognizes that  all issues pertaining to the selection of leaders and political  decisionmaking on behalf of the country are the right of the  people of Afghanistan. The people themselves must make the  decisions.    The people should themselves decide. In our meetings with  governors we emphasized the point that Afghanistan does not want  the continuation of its leadership and political domination, and  despite the will of the people, it has never been and will never  be [words indistinct]. The only thing we want is the presence  of people's representatives on the scene so that we can transfer  political power to them, and the people can decide about their  leadership. Further anarchism, clashes, and misery do not  engulf our nation.    We asked esteemed commanders and governors to convene, as  soon as possible, a large gathering anywhere it is feasible, and  to invite all jehadi leaders and our tribal elders,  personalities from inside the country and abroad, to make a  decision in a large gathering on the future of their country.  The opponents and those who have chosen war as the only way of  achieving their goals should be asked not to add to the pains of  their oppressed people. They should participate in a people's  gathering anywhere it is to be convened. And now, at the  invitation of the southwest zone's commanders and the initiation  of our mojahed brother Esmail Khan, governors and a number of  commanders of the country, and political party leaders or their  representatives will come together in ancient Herat.    The Islamic State's view is that all sides to the problem  should participate in the gathering in ancient Herat. They  should clearly express their views and proposals at this  gathering and then let the people themselves decide. The  decision of our people is surely a righteous decision. We  should welcome the resolve and decision of our people. Any  decision which is made by representatives of our nation, who  come from different provinces of the country or from countries  where they live as refugees and uprooted people, all those who  participate in this gathering should respect the collective  opinion of our people. We will let the people decide and  resolve the future of their country, their political leadership,  and their resolution will be respected by everyone.    We asked the UN and the conference of Islamic foreign  ministers to actively participate in solving the Afghan  problems. After the victory of the Islamic revolution,  Afghanistan has been [word indistinct] by world institutions.  [Words indistinct] and strategic importance of Afghanstan  cannot be restricted only to the pre-war period. Afghanistan  was not an important and hot point just during the presence of  the former Soviet Union. However, after recent changes in the  region, Afghanistan has emerged as an important and major and  strategic country. Surely security in Afghanistan guarantees  security in the region and security in the world. If war and  chaos continue in Afghanistan, the region's countries cannot  live in tranquillity and security. There are some sides who  want Afghanistan to live in tension. Albeit, the international  mafia, international terrorism, and various other sides seek  their interests in Afghanistan's chaos, conflict, and  insecurity. They want insecurity in Afghanistan in order that  the cells of international terrorism and the international mafia  -- those who are engaged in activities for the expansion,  trafficking, and production of drugs in the region and in the  world -- may benefit from this chaos and they want to keep  Afghanistan permanently in a state of war and chaos. The main  problems of the great powers -- America, the European countries,  and others -- are the prevention of drug distribution,  production and trafficking, and the campaign against terrorism.  God forbid, if war and chaos continue in Afghanistan,  terrorists will use Afghanistan and the areas under their  control for terrorist activities in the region. Therefore,  those countries that have completely closed the Afghan file, the  countries that think Afghanistan is no longer of importance  following the fall of the Soviet Union and Communism, will pay a  heavy price. God forbid that insecurity should spread to other  countries from the Afghan borders. If that were the case, not  only would conflicts emerge in the region, but also many  countries would face many problems. Thus, once again we want  great powers, international institutions, and the sides that are  interested -- interested in peace, interested in humane values  -- we ask them not to leave the Afghan nation alone in the  current crisis, much of which has entered our country as  illegitimate imported gifts from abroad.    Unfortunately even the humanitarian assistance to our people  has been cut off for various incorrect reasons. We have been  saying that there are conflicts in Afghanistan; however, there  are not conflicts or clashes in all provinces. In over 25  provinces of the country reconstruction work is broadly under  way. If reconstruction started all over the country at once; if  our youths had the opportunity to be trained and educated  properly; and if unemployment and lack of entertainment did not  exist in our country, surely the seditious elements, consisting  of selfish and adventurist people, could not manage to make use  of the situation. Obviously, unemployment is one of the major  factor for crime and conflict in human society. Our nation  after the war lost almost all opportunities for social work and  economic activities. Fighting and conflicts added to these  difficulties.    Those who believe in human values and human dignity should  not forget the heroic struggle of our nation and the debt they  owe to the people of Afghanistan. The world should not forget  that countries are now safe from the fear of communism which  until yesterday could not sleep at night. Before the uprising  of our heroic and Muslim nation most of the other nations were  spending much of their colossal budgets on repulsing the  communism danger and repulsing the danger posed by the Soviet  Union; they did not feel safe. The sound of alarm, even in  major cities, used to be heard every day warning against the  danger of the possible launching of Soviet nuclear weapons and  cruise missiles against major capitals of the world. Those days  have gone. This confidence, this peace, and the new chapter  that came into being in the world are the result of the  unreserved self-sacrifice of our nation. The world should not  forget the self-sacrifice of our nation and the enormous  devotion shown by our nation, which brought about the gigantic  change. We are witness to the fact that all the ingredients of  the dangers that once threatened the world have not yet been  eliminated. The seeds of danger are still seeking to spring to  life in various regions, in particular in countries that want to  revive once again the past ideologies that formerly put the  world in danger. Afghanistan has surely preserved its strategic  importance and once again we call on all countries and  international institutions to extend their assistance for the  solution of our people's difficulties.    We are hoping that our persecuted nation will emerge intact  from this problem and from this crisis. We are hoping that our  nation by its decisive resolutions will end the existing  conflicts and difficulties in the near future, by sending its  representatives to the national and Islamic shuras. We do not  want to increase the life of the government (?even by one day).  We are trying to take part in every meeting for political talks  and solution of the issues by understanding, and to take part in  every session for the resolution of problems. However, this  subject must be once again cleared up. Our decisions today  should not be rendered in the same way, or manner, as they were  at the time when we were homeless or soon after [words  indistinct] when decisions and resolutions were rendered within  a limited framework, under the name of leadership council or  guidance council. The decision-making platform must be  withdrawn from the leadership council and revert to a large area  and a large gathering. The jihadi leaders must not remain for  ever as guardians or the nation's supervisors and be the only  ones to resolve all issues. Their jihad and their struggles are  respected by all. The leaders however must take part in  people's gatherings and in national shuras as individuals, as  representatives of the people. I believe that henceforth the  jihadi leaders should not attend every gathering as eternal  heirs of the revolutionary uprising. They must nominate  themselves as candidates from provinces or districts; they must  submit themselves to the people and come to a shura from a  district or province, not on the grounds that he was a leader of  a formation or group. Their jihad and their leadership of  jihadi groups is deserving of respect and acknowledgement.  However, they must submit themselves to their people and take  part in the political campaign and in decision- making through  the people. Therefore, the leaders of the parties should not  henceforth insist on resolution of issues and problems to such  an extent as to put themselves on the opposite side of the  people.    These leaders should not set themselves against the aims,  decisions, and will of the people. We are hoping that  henceforth the sound of machine guns and rockets will not  trouble our elders, children, and persecuted people. We are  hoping that our country will not be further destroyed and our  people dragged to slaughter by the hand of Afghans. Concerning  the state, once again I declare we are hoping that a shura,  which will be the center of decision- making, and the highest  forum for the people to express their will, will be convened as  soon as possible. The state will extend every cooperation in  this respect. We do not want to take part in the convocation of  shura although normally the state takes a direct part in the  convocation of shura; we will leave this task to the people; we  will leave it to neutral sides; we leave it to the provinces; we  leave it to the peace delegations. Whatever plan and program  they design and implement we will support. We have asked the  peace delegations -- and once again we call on them -- to  accelerate the process for the restoration of peace and take  serious action for the convocation of the shura. The state will  only extend its cooperation and prepare the ground to facilitate  their activities, but will not interfere in their activities.  They can freely accomplish their work. I am hoping that the  various parties will not continue fighting under any pretext;  they must all join hands so that peace may be restored in our  country. Once again I sincerely express thanks to all who are  here at this session. [passage omitted]     "
0,FT932-16412 ,"FT932-16412 _AN-DDFCIADWFT 930406   FT  06 APR 93 / Arts: Behind the Veil - New York Music      By PAUL GRIFFITHS   America has yet to fall under the spell of 'The Protecting Veil'. The recording has only just been released in the US, and Steven Isserlis's performance at Carnegie Hall last week was the first in New York, coming nearly four years after the Prom premiere that launched the current British wave of interest in John Tavener's music. The mood in the hall was expectant, but also sceptical, which may be why the performance missed incandescence. However, there could have been other reasons. For one thing, to hear Tavener abroad, and played by non-British musicians (the strings of the New England Conservatory Symphony, under Michael Tilson Thomas, were accompanying Mr Isserlis's long cello song), is to be reminded how English his music is - how much its wide-spanning harmonies, say, belong in the tradition of Vaughan Williams, not Copland. The playing was remarkably assured, but too much fizz and thrust and energy was going into the music, and the imitation bell sounds, which reappear to celebrate arrivals at different points in the life of the Mother of God, had an unwanted bodily enthusiasm to them. It could also be that the piece simply works better on record. Everything visual at a concert performance is alien to it: the movements of the soloist (the unbroken line of cello sound asks to be heard as disembodied, as if the instrument were uttering by itself - or, better, as if there were no instrument at all but only the sound), the gestures of the conductor, the uniform obediences of the orchestra, the tiered audience. The inevitable noise of public performance, too, is out of place: even applause seems mistimed, except as an acknowledgement of the heroic feat of stamina, intensity and musicianship achieved by the soloist. Mr Isserlis in his recording sets himself a high challenge; here his maintenance of full, pure tone, up to the highest register and down to the tiniest pianissimo, was extraordinary. It was showpiece playing from one about to receive the triennial Piatigorsky Award. But possibly the not-quite-satisfactory effect of the performance as a whole was entirely a subjective phenomenon: the result of over-exposure, or of worrying about what continuing admirers of the work may regard as incidental details, such as the travelogue picturesqueness of the Levantine microtonal ululations and wild dances, or the wearying repetitions of the same music to open each new chapter, or the limited melodic invention. All is well if nothing happens to make one start asking questions. As soon as one does, the first has to be that of how to interpret Tavener's simplicity as ascetic and not merely cosy.

Sawr 8th, which corresponds with the victory of the Islamic  revolution in our country, revives the memory of the great  resurrection of our nation and of more than 14 years of jihad  and liberation struggle by every compatriot. On this very day  two years ago the sound of God is Great [preceding three words  spoken in Arabic] echoed far and wide in this land of heroes and  the splendid flag of monotheism was unfurled. On this day the  mojahedin of Afghanistan and the entire warrior and believer  nation saw for themselves the fruit of jihad and the promise of  God, and our people were freed from the degrading communist  culture and from ideological and social degradation.    On this occasion I would like to present my cordial  congratulations to you, the free and heroic nation which  demonstrated steadfastness, fortitude, and resistance and which  eventually bravely achieved the victory of the Islamic  revolution. Sawr 8th opened a new chapter in the ancient history  of Afghanistan, and without doubt future generations across the  Islamic, free, independent, united, and unified Afghanistan will  celebrate this day as the dearest blood-price of the fighters on  the path of righteousness and monotheism with jubilation and  enthusiasm.    It is appropriate that on such a day we should mark the  second anniversary of our Islamic revolution, to honor the  victory of the revolution as the blood-price of the martyrs of  Islam and freedom in their tulip-colored shrouds and pray for  the souls of those brave free men of this land who raised the  flag of monotheism and guarded our independence and national  sovereignty with their pure blood. We pray that God will make  paradise their abode and residence.    There is no doubt that the Afghan jihad brought great  changes  in the world in the interest of peace and freedom. One result  of this is the independence of many countries who lived,  directly or indirectly, for many years under [word indistinct]  of the former Soviet Union. The international system of  communism as a base of [words indistinct] terror and colonialism  disappeared. The Berlin wall in the heart of Europe fell,  [words indistinct] and the period of the cold war ended, and a  new era of understanding among countries and continents began.    The 14-year jihad of the people of Afghanistan and its great  international impact, which is called [words indistinct] of the  century, cost our nation very dearly. With the victory of the  Islamic revolution the jihad leaders and the Islamic state  declared a general amnesty -- the greatest example of Islamic  and humanitarian forbearance and forgiveness. It was thereby  decided that clashes and hostilities -- created by looting  aliens and their uncultured servants -- were to be ended for  good and replaced with Islamic fraternity and cooperation.    As for the living standards of state employees, despite  budget restrictions the salaries of state employees have been  doubled and the overdue allowances of civil servants and other  state employees have been paid. It must be mentioned that  despite the fighting and its huge costs, the state has been able  to pay the salaries and other allowances of state employees up  to the month of Hamal 1373, and to pay about seven billion  afghanis to the families of the martyrs, the wounded, and those  whose property was damaged. Steps have been taken to eliminate  the atheist communist culture which was inculcated in certain  circles of our society under the atheist regime, and a program  of economic, social, and cultural policies of the Islamic state  has been initiated within the limits of high national interests  and lofty Islamic teachings.    In the international field, efforts have been made for the  country to emerge from diplomatic isolation and to enter a new  stage of constructive diplomacy in the interest of peace, the  reconstruction of the country, and relations [words indistinct]  with neighbors and all nations of the world.    Dear compatriots, the list of measures and achievements of  the Islamic State of Afghanistan would certainly have been much  longer but for treacherous conspiracies and ruinous battles  waged by the traitorous elements against the achievements of  jihad and the national interest. We mark this great victory at  a time when, unfortunately due to the power-seeking of known  groups and agents of the aliens, a bloody and ruinous war has  been imposed on our nation, especially on the oppressed  residents of Kabul. In this bloody hostility, the Islamic state  has no goal but defense of the oppressed people.    After the victory of the Islamic revolution no armed clash  inside the country has an Islamic and sharia basis. Yes, after  14 years of jihad and after enduring enormous hardships, the  people of Afghanistan were expecting that with the establishment  of the Islamic State an epoch of order, tranquillity, stability  and good intention and welfare would begin. They hoped that no  pain, and that too from the side of the jihadi ranks, would  threaten their individual and social life.    But because of the fiendish and opportunist forces,inside  and  abroad, who preferred their personal and group interest on the  interests of Islam and national interest and who could not bear  a powerful, united and developing Afghanistan in the heart of  the continent of Asia, as a foundation of freedom and justice,  embarked on sabotage and destruction. As a result of those  bloody conspiracies our material and morale forces, which should  have been employed for the reconstruction of the country and for  the repair of damages caused by the war, have been,  unfortunately, used for further destruction and the killing of  our defenseless and innocent compatriots.    Those hostile acts began as from the first days when state  power was handed over to mojahedin. When the gang-leaders of  this catastrophe [words indistinct], and sometimes under the  pretext of opposing the militia and sometimes opposition to some  heroic personalities of jihad fanned the flame of war of [word  indistinct] and fratricide. And thereby not only did they embark  on killing and destruction in the country but also made  questionable many years' prides of the mojahedin in and out of  the country. In pursuit of a peace-seeking policy and observing  the strategy of understanding and talks for the solution of  problems, the ISA [Islamic State of Afghanistan] entered  negotiations patiently and even ignored their organized  conspiracies for the sake of the high national interests and the  urgent realization of peace and security and resorted to the  solution of problems through peaceful means when the ruthless  warmongers embarked on chaos and destruction, and went anywhere  possible in search of peace. But the other side did not adhere  to any treaty and agreement.    Their last treacherous attempt, in the form of the 11th Jadi  [1 January] coup d'etat of the sinister triangle, occurred only  three days after the signing of an agreement which had been  initiated by the peace delegation of the cabinet.    The coup d'etat plan was executed on a day which  corresponded  the date of the establishment of the infamous Khalq party  [People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]. In the incongruous  composition of the putschists, known atheists, national  traitors, and hypocrites have gathered in the form of a shameful  coalition against Islam and Islamic sovereignty and against the  people and the interests of the Afghan nation [37-second break  in reception]. When the [word indistinct] of the coup d'etat  were frustrated in their action, they embarked on retaliation  against the afflicted people of Afghanistan and the residents of  Kabul, and closed the road for the people whom they claim to be  ruling, embarked on the intensification of war and rocket  launching and the destruction of private and state property. It  had not been seen in the history of the world for the prime  minister of a country to commit such crimes against the  residents of his capital, and it has nowhere been seen for a  prime minister, who had been disappointed to seize power in a  monopolized manner, to announce if he did not accede to power in  a desired way, I would continue the killing of the defenseless  nation for another 25 years.    It is interesting that they call elections a solution, and  still think that they will be winners in elections, and expect  that the people of Afghanistan will vote the killers of their  children and the destroyers of their homes and those who  strangulate them every moment by the imposition of famine and  high prices of primary goods. The people have recognized their  enemies.    Dear compatriots, we are of the opinion that the principled  way of the solution of the current crisis of the country is the  creation of an effective electoral mechanism for the appointment  of the future leadership of Afghanistan. As in the past, war  cannot resolve the smallest of problems but it adds to the  hardship. In the opinion of the ISA, talks and understanding  for the cessation of war and bloodshed and for the joint search  for solution of the problems of the country are preferable and  have priority. Now the time of the rejection of the mojahed  forces and their upstaging in the process of determining the  fate of the country has passed. We should all jointly  participate in the cessation of the disputes in the high  interest of the country.    Our faithful and patriotic people are seriously in need of  peace and security. They should practically condemn these  warmongers, and should not allow any person or force to obstruct  the tranquillity of our people and the stability of the  situation. The homeland is the common home of all of us. All  son of this land, belonging to any nationality or tribe and  living in any part of the country and speaking any language, are  equally responsible before the country. The defense of its  independence and honors, effort and striving for its  construction and prosperity are of the common responsibility of  all residents of this land.    Defense of independence and its honor and work for the  country's reconstruction are the common duties and  responsibilities of all who live in this country. Another most  important duty of our people is to foil and repulse the  (?enemies) [words indistinct] who are causing sedition and  disorder in their own self-interests or on the instruction of  groups to whom they are attached. We believe that the faithful  and honest sons of this country are able to resolve and to end  the present crisis and any other crisis in their country without  foreign interference.    I believe that the people of Afghanistan themselves are  confident arbitrators and judges with the right and authority  regarding the national issues of Afghanistan. The people must  have the opportunity to use this right and to decide about their  homeland and its future, its political system, and its  organizational structure. Respecting the will of the people is  an Islamic command and an accepted international tradition.  Therefore, with regard to the solution of current problems, we  believe that a council [shura] representing the will of the  people should be set up. Whatever this council is called or  whatever name they give to it -- great council [loya jerga],  constituent council [shura-e hal wa aqd], grand council [grand  majlis], or any other name -- all nationalities, clans and  tribes, religious sects, and the country's various regions are  to have proportionate representation in this council.    A nongovernmental and competent commission named the  Preparatory Commission for the Formation of the Shura is to be  set up in order to prevent and to eliminate every possible kind  of pressure likely to be exerted on the work of this council or  to prevent any question about its work. This commission will be  tasked with preparing the draft for setting up this council and  determining the procedure for the election of council members  and candidates for the country's leadership. This commission  will have [word indistinct] executive authority and its expenses  are to be paid by the conference of foreign ministers of the  Islamic countries and the United Nations. These two  international organizations can supervise the work of setting up  this council. [words indistinct]    I call on the esteemed arbitrator delegation and all those  who are working for peace to take action as soon as possible to  set up this Shura. As soon as this work is completed I am ready  to hand over all power immediately to this council. I declare  clearly and earnestly to the brave people of Afghanistan that I  personally do not wish to shed even one drop of blood of our  persecuted people for whatever reason or objective. We have  already shown the necessary readiness, and in the future too we  are ready to take every beneficial action on this path. After  this council has been set up, as pointed out, state power will  be handed over. This council will elect the future leadership  in conformity with the will and wish of the entire people. The  council's decision must be respected by all.    It is my duty here to express appreciation for the work and  earnest endeavor of the peace delegations inside the country and  the esteemed ulema from the Islamic countries, as well as for  the work and efforts of the United Nations (?and the UN peace  delegation) led by esteemed M. Mestiri who have been working  very hard.    I hope that as a result of the efforts of the caring people  inside the country and the cooperation of the friendly and  neighborly countries and international organizations, especially  the OIC and UN, the current problem in our country be resolved  and peace and security be restored.    Pursuing the principle of positive nonalignment and  noninterference in the internal affairs of countries near and  far, the Islamic State of Afghanistan is loyal and interested in  the consolidation of peace and stability in the world and does  not interfere in the internal affairs of any country. The  Islamic State of Afghanistan is the serious supporter of  freedom, justice, and the observance of human rights, and  consider respectable and observable the Charter of UN, the  principles of Nonalignment Movement, and all international  conventions which are not against Islamic values. While  remembering with appreciation the support of the neighboring,  Islamic, and other peace-loving countries during the righteous  struggle of the people of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of  Afghanistan once again asks all those countries to render  sincere cooperation with our people in the process of the  ensuring peace and security and the reconstruction of the ruined  Afghanistan. Dear compatriots, congratulating you once again  on the second anniversary of the victory of the Islamic  revolution, I wish that almighty God makes the third year of the  victory of the Islamic revolution, in whose first days we are  now, a year of peace and calm and [words indistinct] in order  that we shall celebrate other anniversaries of this historic day  in an atmosphere of peace and fraternity across the Islamic,  independent, and free Afghanistan, God willing. Peace be upon  you.     "

Ahmad Jibril, PFLP-GC secretary general, said in a statement  before the meeting: As Palestinian alliance forces, we will  discuss in this and other meetings the extent of the serious  impact of the treasonous 'Arafat-Rabin agreement on four million  Palestinians in the diaspora and on their future.    Jibril asserted that there are multiparty conspiracies to  dismiss the issue of the land with regard to millions of  Palestinians in the diaspora. There are also plans to evict the  Palestinians in Lebanon to states that are far away from  Palestine such as Latin and North America.    Jibril added: Here, I would like to clearly say that the  Palestinians in the diaspora were basically the backbone of the  Palestinian revolution and offered great sacrifices throughout  the past 30 years. Through the Cairo agreement, we now see that  those who signed it want to completely destroy the future of the  Palestinian sons in the diaspora.    Jibril asserted that the APF is looking into ways to  confront  the treasonous Oslo agreement in and outside the occupied  territories.    George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for  the  Liberation of Palestine, also made a statement in which he  asserted that the aim of the APF meeting is to discuss the  threats the Oslo-Cairo agreement poses against our people in  Lebanon and the dangers facing them, represented by forcing  settlement and displacement on them.    On the escalation of the heroic Palestinian intifadah,  Habash  said that the APF will work to escalate the intidafah because  what happened in Gaza and Jericho is not a withdrawal but a  redeployment of the Zionist enemy forces.    Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front  for the Liberation of Palestine, made a statement in which he  said that this meeting with Palestinian leaders stationed on  Lebanese territory is to discuss basically the bitter harvest of  the Oslo-Cairo agreement, which is now raising its ugly head in  Lebanon, and its threats to the fate of our Palestinian people  in this Arab country.    Hawatimah asserted that the Palestinian people in the  diaspora are the losers in the Cairo agreement because they are  completely excluded. The right of self-determination for the  people at home has been eliminated. Therefore, the APF in the 4  May meeting, dealt with the problems at home and the self-rule  in light of the practical application of the Cairo agreement.  Today, the entire meeting is devoted to how to contain the  Oslo-Cairo agreement's threats against our people abroad.     "

The meeting was addressed by Ho Chang-cho, chairman of the  North side headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and  Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghaknyon), and  representatives of students and working youths.    Noting that the South side headquarters of Pomchonghaknyon  proposed to the North side headquarters to hold an anti-U.S.  joint meeting of youth and students in the North and South of  Korea and abroad to denounce the U.S. imperialists, the chief  culprit in the brutal Kwangju massacre, on the occasion of the  14th anniversary of the heroic Kwangju popular uprising, the  speakers said if the Chon Tu-hwan-No Tae-u group was the  blood-stained blade of the sword that murdered more than 5,000  citizens and wounded some 14,000 others in Kwangju, its hilt was  the United States.    Denouncing the U.S. imperialists' persistent moves to  isolate  and stifle the DPRK over its fictitious ""nuclear issue"", they  stressed the need for an unremitting struggle to check the U.S.  imperialists' nuclear racket, remove the danger of nuclear war  hanging over the nation and get the U.S. Forces and nuclear  weapons withdrawn from South Korea.    They also emphasized that the South Korean youth and  students  should daringly wage mass struggles to overthrow the Kim  Yong-sam puppet regime, a group of despicable  flunkeyist-traitors, and establish a genuinely independent  democratic government in firm solidarity with the workers,  peasants and other sections of people.    They warned that the U.S. imperialists should look squarely  at the fighting will of the South Korean youth and students and  immediately withdraw from South Korea and that the traitor Kim  Yong- sam should step down without delay before facing a stern  punishment by the people.    A joint declaration of youth and students in the North and  South of Korea and abroad for defending the sovereignty of the  nation was read out at the meeting.    The joint declaration says the United States should stop at  an early date its nuclear racket against the North and rice  market and arms market opening pressure on the South and no  longer create difficulties in the Korean people's way for  national reunification.    It stresses that the South side's authorities must honestly  repent before the whole nation of their policy of dependence on  outside forces and flunkeyist treacheries, cancel at once their  measure for ""tough countermove"" against the North and the move  to establish an ""international cooperation system"" with the  United States, Japan and other countries, and unconditionally  stop suppressing the struggle of youth and students and other  people in the South for independence, democracy and national  reunification.    The 70 million fellow countrymen should make strenuous  efforts for the convocation of a national conference, an arena  for the great unity of the whole nation, transcending the  differences in political view, religious belief, property status  and residence, says the declaration.

These measures were taken to make changes on the ground  and to force its people to flee after the Israeli authorities  closed doors of meting out their means of living in their faces  and preventing them from reaching their workplaces, using the  Afula incident as an excuse while ignoring their incompetence in  dealing with the Hebron massacre and its aftermath when settlers  committed more killings against Palestinians in the West Bank  and Gaza strip, an act in which the Israeli army participated.    This serious incident falls within a known framework of  policy practiced by the Israeli government entailing mass  punishment of the Palestinian people following the acts of  violence -- which cannot be avoided or controlled as long as  this government gives settlers a free reign to kill and carry  out acts of violence and terrorism, and as long as it does not  cooperate in eradicating explosive hotbeds through the peaceful  process, starting with moving settlers from Hebron. Such a  measure would calm sentiments and prove its rejection of the  horrific massacre and killings by settlers and the army while  hundreds of worshipers prayed in al-Ibrahimi mosque and which  spilled over into the West Bank and Gaza strip.    The PLO sees in that Israeli policy, which escalated the  collective punishment measures to the extent of resorting to  importing tens of thousands of Asian laborers, as being a source  of danger and threat to the whole peace process. Accordingly,  the PLO, while rejecting the Israeli policy, is concerned to  make the international community and Security Council states  stand up to these dangerous Israeli practices. It urges the  cosponsors -- the U.S. and Russia -- to intervene to relieve the  suffering, oppression, and killing of the Palestinian people,  and to save the peace process.    Events and incidents have proved that security precautions,  however big and severe, will not succeed in stopping violence  and crime. In the end, every party would be able to make bloody  penetrations which would complicate matters.    Accordingly, the PLO sees that the latest Israeli measures  are pushing matters into a path which run in the opposite  direction to the peace process. The inflexible parties in the  Israeli government have found their chance to destroy this  process, a matter which will drag the region into conflicts,  bloody and violent events, thwarting all dreams of security,  stability and peace.    We call on the international community, particularly the  American and Russian cosponsors, to intervene and put a stop to  the total massacre of our Palestinian people in the occupied  territories -- which affects the core of their daily lives  ranging from the attack on their sanctities and institutions, to  starve them, confiscating their means of living and preventing  them from moving around. These measures are harming all  Palestinian sectors, especially the health sector.     "

The circular said: At present, China enjoys a stable  political environment and a prosperous economy. However, price  hikes occur frequently. Price hikes and unauthorized fees have  provoked a strong reaction from the masses. Some enterprises  raised prices by taking advantage of the reforms in taxation, in  the exchange rate, and of prices; some localities exceeded their  authority, set prices for services, and wantonly collected fees  for personal gain; and some shop owners, instead of marking  prices clearly on their merchandise, demanded unreasonable  prices, fixed prices, and cheated customers. Some of them even  earned exorbitant profits from selling fake and shoddy products.  These illegal operations have pushed up the general price level  and have seriously harmed consumers' interests. To prevent  illegal acts of raising prices, establish order with regard to  market prices, restrain the general price level from an  excessive increase, keep people's lives stable, maintain social  stability, and create a favorable environment for the smooth  implementation of various reforms, the State Council decided to  continue the nationwide general inspection of commodity prices  in 1994.    The circular's demands:    1. The Scope, Focus, and Main Content of the Inspection    All enterprises, individual industrialists and businessmen,  and administration units authorized to collect fees will be  included in the inspection.    The inspection will focus on prices of daily necessities and  fees for various services for citizens which are closely related  to the people's lives.    The main content of the inspection will focus on illegal  acts  of raising prices in the second half of 1993. These illegal  acts include:    1) Raising prices without authorization by taking advantage  of taxation reform and by widening the gaps between purchasing  and selling prices and between wholesale and retail prices, and  raising prices of products and services by adding additional  value-added tax to original prices;    2) Exceeding the authority of price administration to raise  prices and service charges that are supposed to be set by the  state; wantonly raising and charging fees for railway, highway,  and water transportation services; and forcing passengers to buy  insurance while selling them tickets;    3) Violating state regulations on reporting the price  adjustment plan, on controlling price differences, and on  temporary price controls; and failing to mark prices on  commodities;    4) Violating relevant state regulations and wantonly raising  the prices of agricultural production means such as chemical  fertilizers, agricultural films, pesticides, diesel fuel for  agricultural use, and electricity in rural areas;    5) Charging fees outside of authority, adding categories of  charges without authorization, and increasing fees  indiscriminately.    2. The Time and Method of the Inspection    The nationwide general inspection of commodity prices will  begin in late March, and preliminary results must be scored by  the end of June. Price departments at all levels will be in  charge of the inspection. Working together with supervision,  finance, taxation, auditing, industrial and commercial  administration, and technology supervision departments, they  will select cadres to form inspection teams to kick off the  inspection. With the price inspection organizations serving as  the mainstay, the nationwide general inspection of commodity  prices will give full play to price supervision organizations in  all fields. It will be conducted by simultaneously carrying out  propaganda, handling problems, and correcting mistakes.    In the course of the inspection, it is necessary to bring  into full play the role of the mass media in exercising  supervision, utilizing radio and television broadcasts,  newspapers, and journals to build up momentum and create public  support for the general price inspection and to publicize major  and serious cases which have created bad influences. It is also  necessary to encourage the masses to expose various instances of  price violation. Measures for improving and perfecting price  management should be worked out promptly to deal with problems  uncovered during the inspection and to strengthen enterprises'  capability for self-restraint.    Local governments may invite people's congress deputies,  members of political consultative conferences, and the  democratic parties to take part in the price inspection,  bringing into play their role in exercising supervision and  offering guidance.    3. Organization and Leadership of the Inspection    The nationwide general price inspection should be carried  out  and led directly by governments at various levels. Governments  at all levels should attach great importance to, strengthen  leadership over, and assign a leading comrade to take charge of  the inspection, while leaving specific work to the commodity  price departments. To ensure the smooth progress of the  inspection, it is necessary to keep consistent commodity price  departments and staff members, replenish essential inspection  personnel, coordinate relations between various departments in  good time, and effectively solve practical problems arising in  the inspection.    On the basis of investigations and study, governments at all  levels should identify focal points, arrange them in the order  of their priority, formulate plans, study policies, work out  meticulous and well-conceived arrangements to ensure the  concentration of resources to achieve breakthroughs in the focal  points, and use the experience of selected units to promote work  in the entire area, thereby making the inspection a great  success.    All departments should step up cooperation and coordination.  The finance department should ensure outlays for investigating  price violations uncovered in the inspection; banks should  assist price inspection departments to collect, according to the  regulations, fines and confiscations that units and individuals  being penalized refuse to deliver to the state; the industry and  commerce administrative departments should provide active  cooperation in regard to price inspection departments' request  for suspending a business's operations pending consolidation or  revoking its business license; and the public security  department should, in pursuance of the relevant laws and  regulations, punish those who obstruct inspection personnel from  executing their official duties.    The State Council should instruct the State Planning  Commission to work together with the supervision, finance,  taxation, auditing, industry and commerce administration, and  technical supervisory departments in organizing a number of work  groups and should send them to provinces, autonomous regions,  and municipalities to give inspection-related guidance; while  local governments at various levels should also dispatch work  groups to go down to lower levels to supervise the inspection.    4. Requirements of the Inspection Work    1) All inspection personnel should diligently study the  ""Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning  the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure""  adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, to fully recognize the inspection's great importance  for stabilizing commodity prices, reassuring the public, and  ensuring the smooth progress of reform programs. It is  necessary to conduct training to enable inspection personnel to  familiarize themselves with this year's reform programs as well  as relevant professional knowledge, policies, and legislation.  In the course of inspection, it is necessary to uphold  principle, to observe discipline, to perform duties honestly, to  strictly enforce the laws, and to handle price violation cases  impartially without bending laws for the benefit of relatives or  friends.    2) Price inspection offices should sternly handle uncovered  cases of price violation in accordance with the ""Regulations on  Price Management in the PRC"" and other relevant regulations. It  is necessary to instruct units and individuals involved in price  violation to refund their illegitimate incomes to buyers or  consumers. Illegitimate incomes that cannot be refunded should  be confiscated by price inspection offices, and those involved  should be given a fine depending on the degree of gravity of  each case.    3) All units and individuals being inspected should  voluntarily accept inspection and provide accurate information;  those who deliberately create difficulties and refuse to accept  inspection will be given a heavy punishment.    4) It is necessary to protect inspection personnel who  uphold  principle as well as people who expose price violations; and  retaliation against them should by no means be permitted. Those  who shield and connive at acts of price violation should be  affixed with responsibilities and duly punished.    The State Planning Commission is responsible for the  day-to-day work of the nationwide price inspection. Before 20  July, all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities  should submit to the State Council special reports on progress  in the inspection.     "

Will Tracy, 51, said the couple made tape recordings of all conversations in  the house to show that their actions were genuinely religious.

But on  Tuesday, police made a recording of their own through a hidden microphone worn  by the undercover officer.    The Tracys' media appearances brought complaints that prompted the arrests  Tuesday, Lt. Sam Dacus said. Many people who had heard them on broadcast shows  called police, complaining that the Tracys' religious claims were offensive and  asking why they were allowed to continue operating, he said.    Vanderpool said police kept the house under surveillance and interviewed five  men who were leaving the residence Oct. 24 and Nov. 7.

Menem  said: ""Argentina must struggle tirelessly to have those  responsible for these aberrant acts severely punished.""    Menem was referring to the preliminary conclusions of the  British police -- Scotland Yard -- based on the accusations made  by former Corporal Vincent Bramley regarding abuses and crimes  committed by the British after the Mount Longdon battle in 1982.  Another investigation, similar to the British, the conclusions  of which are being zealously guarded, was also carried out in  Buenos Aires two years after the first accusation made by the  former British corporal.    In a news conference Menem said, however, that ""this  circumstance will not change in the least the policy we  implemented regarding relations with Great Britain.""    Although some officials labeled the comments as a ""political  declaration,"" that is, for domestic use rather than aimed at the  British, the president's comments that Argentina must ""struggle  tirelessly to have those responsible for these aberrant acts  severely punished"" put the foreign and defense ministries --for  different reasons -- in a difficult situation.    Just over two months ago in The Hague, in response to a  British reporter from the DAILY NEWS, Menem said: ""At this stage  of events it would be useful to bury that past once and for all.""    For diplomats, the president's change of position involves a  delicate situation in the even more delicate relations with the  United Kingdom which is under the so-called ""umbrella""  protection.    A Foreign Ministry source explained to CLARIN the steps to  be  taken from now on: On one side, wait for the final result of  the Scotland Yard report which has already been sent to public  prosecutor Barbara Mills who should make a decision next April,  and on the other, wait for the British reaction to Menem's  comments.    The concern in the Defense Ministry was different. On 7  February, after CLARIN carried an exclusive publication of the  content of Scotland Yard's report, Defense Minister Oscar  Camilion held a meeting with the commanders of the three  branches of the Armed Forces.    In the meeting a decision was made that the final report of  the Argentine commission which carried out an investigation  questioning former soldiers be submitted to Armed Forces Auditor  General Brigadier Eugenio Miari ""to make a decision on the  appropriate legal procedures"" and to turn it over to the Foreign  Ministry to decide ""on the appropriate actions to be taken.""    This is like a merry-go-round. The Foreign Ministry says it  does not know the content of the Scotland Yard report despite  the fact that its conclusions have been known for 10 days. In  the Defense Ministry, depending on who is consulted, it is said  that the final Argentine report is not ready or that it is  already in the hands of the Armed Forces auditor general.    A source who read the Argentine report said ""it is  absolutely  inconsistent"" and that the accusations ""cannot be proven or  denied."" Being more sincere, a high official admitted to CLARIN  that the conclusions of the Argentine report will be held until  the details of the British report are known.     "

0,FT923-9987 ,"FT923-9987 _AN-CHAAFADSFT 920801   FT  01 AUG 92 / Books: A new wave celebration - Books for the Beach      By KIT MCMAHON   HAUNTS OF THE BLACK MASSEUR by Charles Sprawson Jonathan Cape Pounds 15.99, 307 pages SEVEN-TENTHS by James Hamilton-Paterson Hutchinson Pounds 16.99, 269 pages HERE ARE two books for the beach, celebrating as they do - in different ways  -swimming and the sea. Charles Sprawson's Haunts of the Black Masseur is, despite its opaque and inappropriate title (teasingly half-explained on page 255), straightforwardly a history and celebration of mankind's pleasure in the water. It apparently began life as an article and turning it into a book has left stretch-marks: some repetition and too many long outlines of the plots of novels that deal with swimming. Clearly, Sprawson has read virtually everything on the subject, which makes it shameful that there is neither index nor bibliography. That said, there is much to learn and enjoy - and some splendid photographs. As with so many human activities, the Classical period (especially Rome with its 800 public baths) represents a high point. Then came the Dark Ages, lasting in this case right up to the Romantics, during which most people regarded swimming as very eccentric. But with Goethe, Byron, Shelley, et al, it took off again and has never looked back. For the Romantics and their followers, swimming and the sea symbolised many things: heroic challenge, taken up by Byron in the Hellespont; liberation from the pressures of bourgeois life (until well on in the 19th century everyone swam naked); return to nature and the womb (in spite of Shelley's obsession with bathing and sailing, he never learned to swim, courting death through leaky boats and wild seamanship until he found it). In the 19th century, the English dominated swimming, using the breast-stroke, which had been universal since the dog-paddle disappeared in Elizabethan times. (It was common to learn to swim in the study, watching a frog in a bowl). Then came the crawl, and with it the 20th century has belonged to the other Anglo-Saxon nations and the Japanese. This century has also produced the diver and magnificent feats of daring and beauty, linking aquatics to art and show-business. Finally, Sprawson nicely chronicles for us the explosion of the private pool, both grand and domestic, and a return to the ubiquitous sybaritism of the Romans. James Hamilton-Paterson ranges more widely in Seven-Tenths (another opaque title, whose explanation is that seven-tenths of both the human body and the surface of the globe is water). There is swimming in this book too - through it runs a haunting autobiographical motif of a swimmer in mid-ocean who has drifted out of sight of his boat. But there is much else. A confessed non-scientist, Hamilton-Paterson is engagingly fascinated by the history of scientists' attempts to understand the sea and its creatures. He enjoys and is enjoyable on the subject of persistent misconceptions. For decades after everyone concerned should have known better, the view persisted that water became so dense at deeper levels that sinking ships and human bodies would remain suspended some way above the bottom. For a long time, it was theoretically shown (completely wrongly) that no life was possible in deep layers of the ocean. The author gives an exciting account of the heroic descents by William Beebe and others in small contraptions they built themselves and of the wonderful things they saw. There is a scientific detective story about coral reefs and how they were formed. As so often, it turns out that Darwin got it more or less right. Hamilton-Paterson is good on wrecks; the fascination they exert and the obsessive nature of the searches for them. After Robert Ballard finally succeeded in his quest for the Titanic he said: 'In a way, I am sad we found her'. What gives the book its special quality is the author's elegiac tone, his continuous musing on the emotional, ethical and psychological aspects of the subjects he discusses. There is a moving account of the USS Arizona, a warship sunk at Pearl Harbour which has not been raised but left as a uniquely dignified war memorial ('the only example of a monument which is viewed from above'). We are treated to a persuasive theory that the famous Caribbean pirates were homosexuals to a man. Then the discussion slides to modern pirates in the Philippines and the symbiotic relationship they have with the nomadic sea-people on whom they prey. And then to the nature of nomads and the loss to the human spirit which will be sustained when such people finally disappear from the world. The book indeed is primarily about loss. There are some passionate and well-documented attacks on the current spoliation of the ocean (the chapter on trawler-fishing in the North Sea is particularly horrifying). But the general tone is more subtle. It is well encapsulated by the only incident quoted in both books under revaew As early as 1907 Edmund Gosse lamented that no one would ever again see the wonderful world of the seaside rock-pools which his famous naturalist father had described so beautifully and reverently 50 years before, but which had then been destroyed by the invasion of amateur collectors stimulated by that very account.

These forces have ignited an infernal fire wherever they  can.  Their hegemony went to the point of issuing the utmost  instructions they could give. However, this bridge soon  collapsed at the hands of those who chose the trench of  defending the homeland, the revolution, unity, and the new life  in the Yemen of 22 May. These are the faithful men among the  sons of our people and among their valiant Armed Forces, who  fulfilled their pledge to God and valiantly sacrificed  themselves, so unity would remain brilliant in the homeland, and  so democracy would illuminate the darkness of the totalitarian  and dictatorial one-party system, and so the people would have  the final say because it is derived from God's sayings, and so  the dreams of devils would be shattered. These devils sold  themselves, their fate, and everything that is dear and sacred  in the market of ill wagers, in the face of the will of life, of  maintaining democracy, and of raising high the flags of the  Republic of Yemen.    To these heroes of our Armed Forces, we say: May you rejoice  in the new chapter of pride and glory you are writing everywhere  as a great victory. May you rejoice in the homeland and unity.  To all those who fell victim to their disease and rancor, we  say: History is pouring on you the dust of shame and disgrace,  exactly as it poured dust on similar traitors and agents.  History is also closing the doors to what you planned and to  what your minds and acts sought to achieve. You may face a dark  and bad fate.    We tell the deceived ones whose loyalty is still to God,  the homeland, and the revolution, and who offered dear  sacrifices to protect the achievements of the September and  October revolutions: Disregard the instructions of the  murderers and executioners and the advocates of secession. Join  the honorable trench, the trench of all valiant men and the  trench of protecting legitimacy and preserving unity and  democracy. This is our inevitable path to achieve all  aspirations and hopes. It is our path to heal the wounds of the  hearts through the beginning of a new life, in which there is no  room for crises and fabricators of crises or those who tried to  take dirty money to foil unity and democracy by fabricating  crises and igniting the crime of war and fratricide among the  children of the one Yemeni homeland.    We also hail the brave heroes in the army of the revolution,  unity, and democracy who are now foiling the conspiracy of  secession and raising high the banners of unity. We also hail  all officers, NCO's, and soldiers who refused to fall in the  quagmire of the conspiracy against unity and democracy and  proved that they have cleansed themselves of the filth of the  era of the class vindictiveness and the dictatorship of the one  party and sided with the people, unity, and constitutional  legitimacy. We stress to the people and history that the crime  of the ugly war ignited by the malicious persons in the Yemeni  Socialist Party, particularly traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his  secessionist gang, has clearly exposed the nature of the enemies  of the people, revolution, unity, and democracy.    The chance is now available once again to all heroes in our  Armed Forces and security agencies in Sa'dah, al-Mahrah,  Hadhramaut, Ta'izz, and all parts of the united homeland to join  the ranks of all those who hold unity dear in their hearts.  They now have the chance to prove once again -- with valor,  heroism, and with their warm, pure blood -- that they can defend  the most hallowed value of the people, and to confirm their  readiness to offer the dearest sacrifices to ensure that this  homeland will remain united and its will unbreakable. They have  the chance to confirm the people's democratic choice, upon which  the enemies of the people tried to encroach through all devious  means for the sake of filthy money and a mad attachment to power.    Here they are today digging their own graves so that they  will not remain a source of shame for the homeland and a heavy  burden on the new Yemeni life; so that our people will not live  again in the eras of suppression, terrorism, and bloodbaths, and  the rule of terrorism, suppression, and mass murders of the  cream of the Yemeni society; and so that the future of the  people and country will not be controlled by that gang of  tyrants, murderers, thieves, and criminals, and the madmen of  the blind, vindictive theories and false slogans, which will  only bring to the people death and suppression and to the  homeland fire, destruction, and damage, which they wanted to  afflict on everything beautiful in it.

What he wants now, Dr. Orlando Bosch says, is to remain with his wife and six  children in Miami and continue la lucha -- the struggle against Fidel Castro --  this time in a legal and certainly more peaceful way.    But last Friday the U.S. Justice Department ruled that Bosch, imprisoned here  and in Venezuela for 16 of the past 21 years, should be denied political asylum  and deported, exiled from the capital of el exilio itself.    Since he fled to America in 1960, he has been ""resolute and unwavering in his  advocacy of terrorist violence . . . "" said Joe D. Whitley, acting associate  attorney general. ""We must look at terrorism as a universal evil, even if it is  directed toward those with whom we have no political sympathy.""    In the Miami area, where about 577,000 people are of Cuban birth or descent,  the decision has been met with surprise and, in some quarters, outrage. It is  as if a Don Quixote was being plucked from their midst -- one of the great  icons in the courageous, if so far futile, effort to tilt the windmill Castro.    ""This man symbolizes our resistance, the ideal that each of us must fight to  free Cuba with whatever means are available,"" said prominent Miami attorney  Rafael Penalver. ""Castro wants Bosch dead at any price, and now the United  States seems to be offering him up.""    With that harrowing prospect in mind, local Republican leaders -- stuck with a  back yard mess of the Bush Administration's making -- have pledged to send a  delegation to see the President. And to remind him: Wealthy Cubans have always  been an easy tap for his campaigns.    Hundreds of protesters have marched downtown. Bosch's diabetic son, Willie, 32,  has gone on a hunger strike -- and was rushed to a hospital Tuesday morning  just after he met with Jeb Bush, the President's son. A nationwide three-hour  shutdown of Cuban businesses has been called for this afternoon.    ""Dr. Bosch is not a threat to the U.S.; all that he has done, he has done to  defend democracy!"" insisted taxi driver Blanco Avelino, in a comment typical  among Cubans here, especially the older ones.    To understand the importance of Bosch in Miami is to recall 30 regretful years  of anti-Castroism -- and to examine the great unhealed wound of exile.      Former CIA Support    In the beginning, many Cuban refugees -- whether doctor, salesman or busboy --  saw themselves as part-time commandos. With CIA support, they carried out  hit-and-run attacks against the island, tossing grenades and smuggling guns.    But there were embarrassing failures, and the White House lost interest in its  Cuban militia, stopped paying the bills and confiscated the boats.

BOSCH, ORLANDO; TERRORISM; TERRORISTS; DEPORTATION; CUBANS -- UNITED STATES;  EXILES -- CUBA    "," LA062989-0094   76052    June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 5; National Desk      1272 words      U.S. LABELS BOSCH A TERRORIST;    PLAN TO DEPORT CASTRO FOE ANGERS CUBANS IN MIAMI      By BARRY BEARAK, Times Staff Writer      MIAMI      Will there be no refuge here for the old Cuban terrorist -- his gray hair  rumpled across a weary face, his 62-year-old body fighting its own battles with  angina and ulcers and a bad prostate?    What he wants now, Dr. Orlando Bosch says, is to remain with his wife and six  children in Miami and continue la lucha -- the struggle against Fidel Castro --  this time in a legal and certainly more peaceful way.    But last Friday the U.S. Justice Department ruled that Bosch, imprisoned here  and in Venezuela for 16 of the past 21 years, should be denied political asylum  and deported, exiled from the capital of el exilio itself.    Since he fled to America in 1960, he has been ""resolute and unwavering in his  advocacy of terrorist violence . . . "" said Joe D. Whitley, acting associate  attorney general. ""We must look at terrorism as a universal evil, even if it is  directed toward those with whom we have no political sympathy.""    In the Miami area, where about 577,000 people are of Cuban birth or descent,  the decision has been met with surprise and, in some quarters, outrage. It is  as if a Don Quixote was being plucked from their midst -- one of the great  icons in the courageous, if so far futile, effort to tilt the windmill Castro.    ""This man symbolizes our resistance, the ideal that each of us must fight to  free Cuba with whatever means are available,"" said prominent Miami attorney  Rafael Penalver. ""Castro wants Bosch dead at any price, and now the United  States seems to be offering him up.""    With that harrowing prospect in mind, local Republican leaders -- stuck with a  back yard mess of the Bush Administration's making -- have pledged to send a  delegation to see the President. And to remind him: Wealthy Cubans have always  been an easy tap for his campaigns.    Hundreds of protesters have marched downtown. Bosch's diabetic son, Willie, 32,  has gone on a hunger strike -- and was rushed to a hospital Tuesday morning  just after he met with Jeb Bush, the President's son. A nationwide three-hour  shutdown of Cuban businesses has been called for this afternoon.    ""Dr. Bosch is not a threat to the U.S.; all that he has done, he has done to  defend democracy!"" insisted taxi driver Blanco Avelino, in a comment typical  among Cubans here, especially the older ones.    To understand the importance of Bosch in Miami is to recall 30 regretful years  of anti-Castroism -- and to examine the great unhealed wound of exile.      Former CIA Support    In the beginning, many Cuban refugees -- whether doctor, salesman or busboy --  saw themselves as part-time commandos. With CIA support, they carried out  hit-and-run attacks against the island, tossing grenades and smuggling guns.    But there were embarrassing failures, and the White House lost interest in its  Cuban militia, stopped paying the bills and confiscated the boats.    Freedom-loving commandos suddenly became law-breaking terrorists -- and most of  them resignedly gave up their second identities as saboteurs to root their  lives in America. Most of them -- but not all.    Among the staunch holdouts was Bosch, an unlikely looking warrior, a baby  doctor with thick glasses and a bad stomach.

Leaders of the Nanjing Military Region, the provincial party  committee, the provincial military district including [Nanjing  Military Region Political Commissar] Fang Zuqi, [Provincial  Party Secretary] Jia Qinglin, [Provincial Military District  Commander] Ren Yonggui, and [Provincial Military District  Political Commissar] Sui Shengwu attended the meeting.    The Coastal Defense Company is a heroic company with a  glorious tradition. During the war years, it won the title of  honor of the Libao Battle Heroic Company. During the period of  socialist construction, they were always advanced in the  construction of all fields of endeavor. Particularly in recent  years, always bearing our army's fundamental function in mind,  they have conscientiously performed their duties, paid keen  attention to the implementation of the strategic system, and  made outstanding contributions in defending the motherland's  coastal security and economic construction. Their advanced  deeds are an embodiment of our party and Army's fine traditions  and a revelation of the completely new style and features of the  soldiers of a new generation.    On behalf of the Nanjing Military Region, Fang Zuqi warmly  congratulated the Coastal Defense Model Company and hoped its  officers and men would keep a cool head in the face of honors,  persist in setting high and strict demands on themselves, strive  to be really up to the mark in all fields, and set a good  example for all the troops of the region. He also urged all the  troops in the region to keep their heavy responsibilities firmly  in mind; conduct, in an extensive and down-to-earth manner, the  activities of striving to be an advanced company and outstanding  soldiers; train more advanced units like the Gulangyu Good  Eighth Company and the Coastal Defense Model Company; and strive  comprehensively to uplift army building to a new level.    On behalf of the provincial party committee, government, and  people across the province, provincial CPC Secretary Jia Qinglin  attended and congratulated the company. He called on the cadres  and people of the province to conduct extensive activities to  learn from the Coastal Defense Model Company and to learn from  their efforts to foster a correct world outlook and values,  enhance dedication to the revolutionary cause and the sense of  responsibility toward work, set high and strict demands, carry  out work in a down-to-earth manner, and strive for first-rate  achievements; learn also from their fine quality of strictly  discharging their duties and building an enterprise through  arduous efforts; and learn from their experience in  strengthening ideological and political work in the new  situation with a new mental outlook and new forms of activity.  He urged that we should guide, protect, and give play to the  enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people and strive  in our struggle for the development and rejuvenation of Fujian  and the realization of our province's ""three-step"" strategic  goal.

These vile crimes eloquently demonstrate the extremely racist  nature of the Zionist enemy, which is hostile to all that is  humanitarian and good in this world, while it brags about  peaceful solutions.    The Hebron massacre and the bloody confrontations that  followed it in the occupied territories reaffirm our party's  unwavering stand on the illusion of peace with the usurping  enemy. They also represent further evidence of the principles  that what has been taken by force can only be retrieved by force  and that there is no final solution to the Palestinian issue  other than the liberation of all its territories from Zionist  desecration. Our party stresses that Zionists' ruses will not  deceive the Arab people. There is nothing that can make us  differentiate between the Zionist settlers' actions and the  practices of the occupation gangs. All of them were involved in  shedding Arab blood during the month of Ramadan in the Ibrahimi  Mosque and in the steadfast towns of the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip. It is logical for Rabin to attempt to depict the bloody  massacre as an action of an irresponsible individual and to ask  the Palestinians to exercise self-restraint and not stage  provocative acts against him?! However, it is shameful for the  Egyptian Foreign Ministry to issue a statement describing the  bloody massacre as part of the extremist acts that are engulfing  the world, as if it is the government's duty to look for excuses  and justifications that absolve the Zionist gangs from the  martyrs' blood. Still worse is the Egyptian Government's  determination to continue to deceive the Arabs and tame them so  as to accept the humiliating capitulation to the Zionist enemy.    These regrettable incidents have proved the weakness and  naivete of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which places the  Palestinian people firmly in the Zionist enemy's palm. They  have destroyed for good all the illusions that have been  propagated about living under the Zionist spears and among tense  and racist settlements. It is a glaring idiocy for some Arab  rulers to call on the Zionist enemy to protect the Palestinians  in the occupied territories when the occupation forces protected  the killers while they broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and are  still firing the bullets of treachery at the Arab demonstrators  in every Palestinian village and town.    The time has come for the Arab rulers to wake up from their  slumber, stop squandering the rights of the Arab people in  Palestine, shake off their submissiveness to U.S.-Zionist  orders, and voluntarily abandon--before being forced to do  so--the suspicious propagation of plans of capitulating to  Zionist ambitions.    Our party calls on the Arab masses to declare their anger,  profess their solidarity with our kinsmen in the occupied  territories through all available means, and fully condemn  attempts to impose capitulation to Zionist ambitions. We call  on the Arab masses to boycott all forms of normalization with  the Zionist enemy. The NADP declares its full support for the  Arab people's intifadah in Palestine, which is one of the  noblest expressions of Arab rejection in an age of government  subservience to Zionist arrogance.

Nedzar Leko reports:    [Leko] At the beginning of the news conference Navaz Sharif  explained the purpose of his visit:    [Sharif, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation]  ""The purpose of my visit to Bosnia is to express solidarity  with the heroic struggle of the Bosnian people. This is also a  humanitarian mission, whose aim is to establish the facts. I  wanted to find out what could be done to lessen the suffering of  the Bosnians so that I could help the Bosnian cause on the  political and diplomatic front.    ""Of course, Bosnia must be given much more attention than  the  international community has done so far. The international  community does not have a clear picture of Bosnia. I am  referring to a section of the international community, which  does not support the Bosnian cause in the way it should, not  even as regards humanitarian aid. The international community  should be much more active in supporting the Bosnian cause.    ""We have now seen the situation ourselves. In the past, we  only heard on television or read in the newspapers that the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is very grave. It is painful to  see that the Bosnians are compelled to live in a situation such  as this, while the world is still not doing anything about it.""    [Leko] In his introductory speech, Navaz Sharif also spoke  about the double standards of the world, demanding that an end  be put to it.    [Sharif] ""While the victims of aggression, the Bosnians, are  continuing to suffer, the aggressor is neither being halted nor  punished. Bosnia is not only an Islamic or European issue.  This is an international humanitarian issue, because crimes are  here being committed against humanity and human rights are being  violated. This must be stopped.    ""We think that the lifting of the arms of embargo is  something that should be done so that the Bosnians can defend  themselves. Also, it must be made possible for humanitarian aid,  food, medicine, and clothing, to arrive in Bosnian unobstructed.  These are the main things that should be done with regard to  Bosnia. This task should be undertaken by the United Nations  and the international community.""    [Leko] Replying to journalists' questions on the causes of  the inefficiency of the Organization of Islamic Countries, Navaz  Sharif said:    [Sharif] ""It is a pity that not enough is being done.  Actually, the international community is rather indifferent, and  I think that the Organization of Islamic Countries must mobilize  itself more. Pakistan will play an important role with regard  to demands for the lifting of the arms embargo. It will not be  enough only to lift to the embargo. A way must be found to  deliver it [arms] to Bosnia. The prevention of arms deliveries  to Bosnia is sheer discrimination and we will use diplomatic  channels to influence those countries that are opposed to the  lifting of the embargo into changing their view.""

0," LA012690-0163   167583    January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition      Calendar; Part F; Page 1; Column 5; Entertainment Desk      1019 words      KIDS' TV GETS MORE VIOLENT, STUDY FINDS;    TELEVISION: SATURDAY- MORNING CARTOONS AVERAGE A VIOLENT ACT NEARLY EVERY OTHER  MINUTE, ACCORDING TO A THREE-YEAR STUDY BY ANNENBERG SCHOOL.      By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      A ""violence profile"" of network programs released here Thursday reported that  violence in children's television programming climbed dramatically during the  past three years, while prime-time levels remained high but unchanged from  earlier in the decade.    ""For most viewers, television's mean and dangerous world tends to cultivate a  sense of relative danger, mistrust, dependence and -- despite its supposedly  'entertaining' nature -- alienation and gloom,"" concluded the report, conducted  under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of  Communications.    The rate of violent acts in prime time remains a steady five to six each hour,  while about half of all major characters are involved in violence and 10% in  killing, the study found. Such figures have remained about the same since the  researchers compiled their first ""violence profile"" in 1967, defining  ""violence"" as ""overt and explicit physical acts or threats of hurting or  killing in any context.""    Figures rose dramatically for children watching Saturday morning cartoons, who  on the average saw an unparalleled 26.4 violent acts or more each hour, the  survey found, compared to 18.6 per hour before 1980.    The researchers blamed the escalating violence in part on the federal  government's move in the early 1980s to deregulate the broadcasting industry,  but also on the networks' penchant for action-oriented programming.    ""We're doing severe damage to our people through television violence,"" said  Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who introduced the research findings at a Capitol  Hill press conference.    Simon is trying to gather support for his Television Violence Act, a bill that  would encourage, but not require, the three networks to set common standards on  the level of violence in their programming. NBC, CBS and ABC have fought  Simon's measure as a threat to their First Amendment rights to determine  program content as they see fit.    Spokesmen for the three major networks declined to comment on the findings  released Thursday, saying they had not yet seen the study. Network officials in  the past have taken issue with the methodology used in compiling the ""violence  profile"" data.    The study found that CBS was the most violent of the three networks in prime  time from 1986 to 1989, showing an average of 5.1 violent incidents per hour in  the 1986-87 season, 6.9 in 1987-88 and 7.3 in the last TV season. In  comparison, NBC showed 4.1 such incidents per prime-time hour in 1986-87, 3.2  in 1987-88 and 5.7 in 1988-89; ABC's violence index was recorded as 6.6, 5.1  and 5.3, respectively.    Nancy Signorielli, an associate professor in the University of Delaware's  communications department and co-director of the yearly study, said  violence-saturated programming can influence viewers' personalities,  particularly among children -- deadening compassion for others' suffering,  exaggerating fear of other people, and even promoting a greater willingness to  be violent themselves.    George Gerbner, a professor in the Annenberg School of Communications and the  study's co-director, called violence ""a cheap ingredient"" used in programs to  make a profit with minimum creative and financial investment.    ""Violence is imposing itself on producers and directors because it's cheap,""  Gerbner said, contending that viewers cannot exercise their right to avoid  ""entertaining murders"" and otherwise violence-laden programs.    ""You can change the channels, but you do not have a choice. We are born into  it,"" he said. ""Like the wallpaper on the wall, you absorb its pattern without  even knowing it.""    Gerbner noted that children's shows are rife with humorous abuse of characters,  the humor serving as ""sugar coating"" for destructive ""messages of power."" He  emphasized that children watch an average of 27.3 hours of TV each week.    Simon's bill, versions of which have been passed by both the House and Senate,  would grant the three networks a limited three-year immunity from the Sherman  Anti-Trust Act, which now prevents network officials from meeting to coordinate  broadcasting strategies.    Simon has tried since 1984 to pass the measure. This session of Congress offers  the best prospect so far of approval, following the House's 399-18 vote in  favor last August.    A potential stumbling block remains, however, in reconciling the Senate and  House versions. Before the Senate unanimously passed the bill last May, Sen.

By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      A ""violence profile"" of network programs released here Thursday reported that  violence in children's television programming climbed dramatically during the  past three years, while prime-time levels remained high but unchanged from  earlier in the decade.    ""For most viewers, television's mean and dangerous world tends to cultivate a  sense of relative danger, mistrust, dependence and -- despite its supposedly  'entertaining' nature -- alienation and gloom,"" concluded the report, conducted  under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of  Communications.    The rate of violent acts in prime time remains a steady five to six each hour,  while about half of all major characters are involved in violence and 10% in  killing, the study found. Such figures have remained about the same since the  researchers compiled their first ""violence profile"" in 1967, defining  ""violence"" as ""overt and explicit physical acts or threats of hurting or  killing in any context.""    Figures rose dramatically for children watching Saturday morning cartoons, who  on the average saw an unparalleled 26.4 violent acts or more each hour, the  survey found, compared to 18.6 per hour before 1980.    The researchers blamed the escalating violence in part on the federal  government's move in the early 1980s to deregulate the broadcasting industry,  but also on the networks' penchant for action-oriented programming.    ""We're doing severe damage to our people through television violence,"" said  Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who introduced the research findings at a Capitol  Hill press conference.    Simon is trying to gather support for his Television Violence Act, a bill that  would encourage, but not require, the three networks to set common standards on  the level of violence in their programming. NBC, CBS and ABC have fought  Simon's measure as a threat to their First Amendment rights to determine  program content as they see fit.    Spokesmen for the three major networks declined to comment on the findings  released Thursday, saying they had not yet seen the study. Network officials in  the past have taken issue with the methodology used in compiling the ""violence  profile"" data.    The study found that CBS was the most violent of the three networks in prime  time from 1986 to 1989, showing an average of 5.1 violent incidents per hour in  the 1986-87 season, 6.9 in 1987-88 and 7.3 in the last TV season. In  comparison, NBC showed 4.1 such incidents per prime-time hour in 1986-87, 3.2  in 1987-88 and 5.7 in 1988-89; ABC's violence index was recorded as 6.6, 5.1  and 5.3, respectively.    Nancy Signorielli, an associate professor in the University of Delaware's  communications department and co-director of the yearly study, said  violence-saturated programming can influence viewers' personalities,  particularly among children -- deadening compassion for others' suffering,  exaggerating fear of other people, and even promoting a greater willingness to  be violent themselves.    George Gerbner, a professor in the Annenberg School of Communications and the  study's co-director, called violence ""a cheap ingredient"" used in programs to  make a profit with minimum creative and financial investment.    ""Violence is imposing itself on producers and directors because it's cheap,""  Gerbner said, contending that viewers cannot exercise their right to avoid  ""entertaining murders"" and otherwise violence-laden programs.    ""You can change the channels, but you do not have a choice. We are born into  it,"" he said. ""Like the wallpaper on the wall, you absorb its pattern without  even knowing it.""    Gerbner noted that children's shows are rife with humorous abuse of characters,  the humor serving as ""sugar coating"" for destructive ""messages of power."" He  emphasized that children watch an average of 27.3 hours of TV each week.    Simon's bill, versions of which have been passed by both the House and Senate,  would grant the three networks a limited three-year immunity from the Sherman  Anti-Trust Act, which now prevents network officials from meeting to coordinate  broadcasting strategies.    Simon has tried since 1984 to pass the measure. This session of Congress offers  the best prospect so far of approval, following the House's 399-18 vote in  favor last August.    A potential stumbling block remains, however, in reconciling the Senate and  House versions. Before the Senate unanimously passed the bill last May, Sen.  Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) was able to amend the scope of the bill to target not only  TV violence but also ""glorified"" depictions of drug use and violent or  promiscuous sexuality. The House version only addresses violence.    Spokesmen for NBC, CBS and ABC say Simon's bill threatens their right to set  program content without government interference.

Do you  believe that more acts of reciprocal violence will adversely  affect the peace process?    [Rabin] I believe that the Israeli Government and its prime  minister and the PLO and its chairman Yasir 'Arafat must pursue  two parallel courses simultaneously. The first course is to  focus on the negotiations to reach an agreement on the  Gaza-Jericho First accord. This, in my opinion, is the best  response to the enemies of peace from among the Israelis and  Palestinians. The second course is that when a mistake is made  either by the Israelis or the Palestinians, such as an act of  violence or terrorism, especially if it is directed against  innocent people, we must show [sentence incomplete]. For  example, the Hebron massacre, which was committed by a mentally  disturbed Israeli murderer, is as serious as the attack on the  bus that was carrying innocent Israelis. Both the Palestinian  and Israeli sides must show that we have reached a point in  which we are trying to resolve the conflict by negotiations and  not by violence and terrorism. I myself did not listen to the  shouts of the demonstrators in Israeli towns after the brutal  acts which Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried out in Afula and  Hadera. I explained to the Israeli public that we will continue  the negotiations without delay or postponement.    The PLO suspended the talks with Israel for a month  following  the Hebron massacre. A number of Israelis asked me why they  stopped the talks after the Hebron massacre and we did not halt  them after the terrorist attacks against us. My answer was that  I am doing what I believe to be correct.    I explained this stand of mine in my telephone conversation  with Chairman 'Arafat. I believe if we want to give a real  response to the enemies of peace, we must show them that we can  reach an agreement and implement it. Any terrorist activity and  any act of violence against Israeli and Palestinian citizens  aims at obstructing the attainment and implementation of an  agreement. In the telephone conversation I explained to 'Arafat  that we will continue the negotiations as scheduled on Sunday  despite the terrorist acts. Our delegation will leave for Cairo  to resume the talks on Monday. You might ask me why the talks  were postponed from Sunday to Monday. My answer is that the  postponement was in response to a request from the Palestinian  side.    [Al-Hinnawi] Will an agreement be signed in Cairo between  the Palestinians and Israel before the end of April and during  the upcoming tour of the U.S. Secretary of State to the region?    [Rabin] In accordance to what was agreed upon in Cairo in  December, we must take into consideration that if we do not  prepare well for the upcoming meeting, it will mean failure.  And failure means frustration and disappointment. Therefore,  in the last meeting in Cairo we agreed on the following:    1. Whatever is agreed upon will be written down and  initialed.    2. Matters on which no agreement is reached will be  divided into two parts:    A. Topics necessary for inclusion in the agreements that  precede the implementation.    B. Topics that we will continue to discuss but that are  not in existing agreements; these are topics that will not  prevent us from implementing the agreement. This is how we are  working. I believe we have reached agreement on most solutions  and basic points. Anything on which agreement is reached and  which is signed must not be reopened for discussion. For  example, the Declaration of Principles that we signed in  Washington and the Cairo agreement and the maps appended to it  will not be reopened for discussion. If we do this, we will be  going around in a vicious circle. We have already wasted a lot  of time discussing matters on which agreement had been reached  in the previous two agreements.    [Al-Hinnawi] Certain reports say that if no agreement is  reached by the end of this month, you will implement what was  actually agreed upon.    [Rabin] We must sign an agreement that it is possible to  implement. In other words, when we hold negotiations over peace  with an Arab state, the agreement should be clear. Our  negotiations must revolve around the meaning of peace, the issue  of borders, the security arrangements, the stages of the  implementation of the agreement, and whether the various stages  will overlap in a way similar to what happened with Egypt.    But what we are trying to do with the Palestinians is  peaceful coexistence without division or clear lines, because  there are no dividing lines. For example, as regards the route  between Gaza and Jericho and which falls within Israel's  borders, we must allow the Palestinians to use this route. We  must, therefore, agree on the security arrangements concerning  this point. This is more difficult than reaching a peace  agreement with Jordan, Lebanon, or even Syria. The agreement  with the Palestinians is a temporary one, for self-rule. We  have approved many of the Palestinians' demands because we don't  want to waste time in search of this or that change.    [Al-Hinnawi] Did you start any unofficial secret talks with  Syria as you did with the PLO far from the press and spotlights?    [Rabin] As far as I recall, we tried to arrange a quiet  meeting with the Syrians. But they refused. I believe that  without a quiet and unannounced meeting, it would be difficult  to reach an agreement. Recent history explains this. Since  1977, no agreement has been reached without holding unannounced  preliminary contacts. Even President Anwar al-Sadat's visit to  Jerusalem could not have been made had it not been for the  unpublicized preliminary talks between al-Tuhami [an adviser to  al-Sadat] and Moshe Dayan in Morocco during the summer of 1977.  It was a long time before the majority of the Israeli cabinet  members knew about these talks. The same thing happened with  the other Arab countries. Let me say frankly, it would have  been impossible to reach agreement with any Arab state and the  PLO without the secret talks that preceded the publicized talks.    [Al-Hinnawi] Does the long calm on the Syrian front mean  that  Syria is fully concerned with peace and that President al-Asad  is fully prepared for peace? And do you believe that Syria  could accept something less than Egypt accepted during the  complete withdrawal from the Egyptian territory? And is it  conceivable that a government led by you could refuse to sign an  agreement with Syria similar to that signed between the Likud  and Egypt?    [Rabin] Let me tell you the real difference between the  Egypt-Israel peace process and the situation between Syria and  Israel. As regards Egypt, President al-Sadat took an extremely  courageous step when he came to Israel. He managed to convince  the Israeli people that there is an Egyptian leader who decided  not to continue the war and confrontation and to get involved in  the peace process and negotiations without this changing Egypt's  view regarding the achievement of peace.    President al-Sadat did 80 percent of what was expected from  the Israeli Government and the prime minister of that time in  order to convince the Israeli people to pay the price of peace.  The Israeli people hold the same feelings toward President  Mubarak, who has for 12 and half years of the 15-year old peace  between Egypt and Israel been safeguarding and promoting the  peace process.    But President al-Asad has not done even one percent of what  Egypt has done to establish peace. He did not even declare  frankly his desire for peace. I agree with you that there are  no acts of aggression on the Syrian-Israeli front. But had it  not been for Syria's help, the 10 Palestinian rejectionist  organizations led by Ahmad Jibril, Hawatimah, Habash, Abu-Musa,  and others or even Hizballah would not be able to do what they  are currently doing. Syria talks peace and at the same time  allows these organizations to attack 'Arafat and the PLO because  of their negotiations with Israel. Syria is not only hosting  these organizations, but it also allows them to operate in  Lebanon. Therefore, although Syria is not directly involved in  acts of aggression against Israel, it has made it possible for  them to act. These organizations would have never been able to  act had it not been for Syria.    [Al-Hinnawi] Very well, Mr. Rabin. You said that when  President Anwar al-Sadat came to Israel he did 80 percent of the  Israeli Government's work, because he persuaded the Israelis  that he was serious about peace. What if another Arab leader,  President Hafiz al-Asad for example, were to visit Israel?  Perhaps you would later conclude that he failed to impress the  Israeli public with his seriousness about peace?    [Rabin] It is not necessary for al-Asad or anyone else to  come to Israel. Let me tell you something. Why have I  insisted that Palestinian-Israeli negotiations take place in  Cairo and not Washington? To avoid publicity.    Another thing. We believe that Egypt has done so much and we  appreciate that. We appreciate what President Husni Mubarak and  his government are doing to help the two sides, quietly and  backstage.    When Syria went to the Washington talks, the talks were  conducted on a relatively small scale. However, every  journalist expected a statement to come out of every meeting.  This is not the best way to work things out. The talks should  begin unofficially, quietly, and away from the media.    I would not call for a meeting between me and President  al-Asad tomorrow. Such a meeting would not be useful without  quiet preparations.    [Al-Hinnawi] Reports speak of rapprochement between Israel  and a number of Arab countries. Can you clarify the picture for  us a little?    [Rabin] I believe that peace between Egypt and Israel is  what  broke the ice between Israel and Arab countries. Undeniably,  Egypt is the largest and most important Arab country. In my  modest opinion, Egypt has proved that peace can be achieved and  maintained.    Another thing. When I took over as prime minister, the  Madrid Conference formula was already in place. We did nothing  to change that formula, but sought to create another channel.    We figured that the two keys to peace in the region are in  the hands of the Palestinians and the Syrians. Jordan wants to  be out in front [as published]. Lebanon does not want to do  anything without Syria's approval.    We studied the situation and reached the conclusion that it  is better to begin with the Palestinians on the basis of two  conditions; one is mutual recognition and the second is a  statement of principles. We made a historic change in our  policy toward the PLO. This change was based on the conditions  we agreed upon and later the letters of mutual recognition  appended to the Declaration of Principles.    Once we moved toward implementing the Declaration of  Principles, the ball started rolling. For example, the  multilateral talks of the Water Committee will begin in Muscat,  Oman, today. Early next month, the Arms Limitation Committee of  the multilateral talks will meet in Qatar. This would have been  unthinkable only a year and half ago. We have begun to see  change and its continuation depends to a large extent on the  Palestinians and the Syrians.    As for Morocco, it has a large Jewish community. Actually,  there is unofficial normalization between Morocco and Israel.  Israeli citizens can go to Morocco to try and improve economic  ties between the two countries. Israeli tourists are also  allowed into Morocco.    You must not forget that, in 1977, King Hassan helped  organize a meeting between senior Egyptian and Israeli officials  in Morocco, a meeting that helped set the peace process in  motion. Although there are no diplomatic ties between Israel  and Morocco, relations between us are good.    Our relations with Tunisia may not be quite as good as those  with Morocco. But the mere fact that the PLO leadership is  located in Tunisia and that many Israelis, particularly  journalists, go there is a measure of the level of relations  between the two countries.    [Al-Hinnawi] Do you believe that Russia still has a part to  play in the peace process?    [Rabin] Russia is one of the two countries sponsoring the  peace talks. I will visit Moscow on 24 April to meet President  Yeltsin. Chairman 'Arafat will also visit Russia to meet Yeltsin  on 18 and 19 of this month.    [Al-Hinnawi] Is there not a possibility of a meeting between  you and 'Arafat in Moscow?    [Rabin] I do not think so.    [Al-Hinnawi] Is U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's visit to the region at the end of this month  linked to the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement?    [Rabin] I do not think so. If we can reach an agreement  during this time, it will be good. Christopher is coming to the  region basically to give a boost to the multilateral talks.    [Al-Hinnawi] I would like to convey to you a message from  the  people of Gaza. I was there last week and saw for myself the  extent of the people's suffering as a result of sealing off the  Gaza Strip. The people in Gaza say that the recent acts of  terrorism did not come from Gaza. The Israeli Army and police  are imposing a security cordon around the city. Supplies of  medicines and oxygen necessary for surgery have stopped and  students are not going to their colleges and workers are not  going to work. Will this continue?    [Rabin] This is untrue. I know nothing about the stoppage of  medicine and oxygen supplies. I gave orders to supply the Gaza  population with their needs. The territories were sealed only  for those who come to work in Israel.    [Al-Hinnawi] Soldiers order drivers of vehicles carrying  oxygen and heading for the Gaza Strip to go back.    [Rabin] There is absolutely no need for such measures. Even  in Jerusalem we made special arrangements for doctors, nurses,  and workers in Palestinian hospitals and Palestinians working  for international organizations to go to work. All these  workers obtained licenses enabling them to go to work. The same  thing applies to Gaza.    [Al-Hinnawi] The Palestinians in Gaza are wondering why the  Israeli Government is taking these measures right before its  withdrawal and before the Palestinian authority undertakes its  mission. Are these the good-neighborly relations that Israel is  talking about? Israel is giving the worst picture of the future  neighborly relations it is seeking.    [Rabin] Yes, but you must not forget that I do not know who  will carry out the next terrorist operation.    [Al-Hinnawi] But you, Mr. Prime Minister, are meting out  collective punishment that is harming innocent people.    [Rabin] I have no option but to continue sealing off the  occupied areas in order to know what is going on and then to  decide what I can do.    [Al-Hinnawi] Despite the security cordon imposed on the Gaza  Strip, numerous acts of violence occurred recently. The  Palestinians in Gaza are wondering about the use of this  security seal.    [Rabin] You do not know the number of operations that have  been foiled as a result of sealing off the territories. I told  the Israelis that even after the territories were sealed off we  could not completely prevent terrorist operations. In  Jerusalem, for instance, the Palestinians used a vehicle with  Israeli plates and were able to move in all parts of Israel. In  certain areas the Israelis and Palestinians are only meters away  from each other. There are no walls and we do not want walls. I  would like to tell you as a fact that there are Israeli  businessmen who have received Palestinian workers in the heart  of Israel for months without obtaining a permit. We cannot  search every house. In the two cases involving killing and  violence, we found out that two Palestinians from Khan Yunus had  been in Israel since December. The real problem is that the  situation was so aggravated because of the Hebron massacre that  certain members of terrorist organizations were aroused to the  point that they decided in a moment of extreme anger to wield  knives and hatchets to attack Israelis. Regrettably, no device  has yet been invented to reveal man's inner intentions.     "

The Alliance of the Palestinian Forces has held a meeting in  which it discussed the latest political developments given the  determination of 'Arafat and his team to plunge deeper into the  quagmire of the liquidatory Oslo-Washington agreement and to  make concession after concession in order to meet the Zionist  enemy leaders' conditions, the latest of which was 'Arafat's  declaration in Davos that he had no intention of establishing a  Palestinian state, but that he was working to establish a  confederation with Jordan.    On the occasion of the beginning of the 75th month of the  intifadah, which coincides with the arrival of the blessed month  of Ramadan, the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces extends its  greetings and appreciation to the sons of the brave intifadah,  who are stepping up their heroic deeds in the face of the  growing violence of the enemy's soldiers and its herds of  settlers. This is, in fact, a practical retaliation in order to  topple the Gaza-Jericho agreement and to continue and escalate  the intifadah against the invaders.    In light of these developments, the Alliance of the  Palestinian Forces assert that the Palestine question is not the  property of 'Arafat and his men and, therefore, he cannot do  with it whatever he wishes because it belongs to the Palestinian  people and their national forces, who reject liquidatory  solutions, and who struggle to achieve our people's goals of  repatriation, self-determination, and full national  independence. What 'Arafat says basically means an annexation  by Jordan of the partial self-rule authority, which is being  rejected by the overwhelming majority of the sons of our  Palestinian people.    This statement is aimed at reassuring the Zionist enemy.  'Arafat no longer speaks for or expresses the will of the  Palestinian people. Therefore, his opinions and positions are  no longer binding on our people.    The alliance again urges the sons of the Arab and Islamic  nations, as well as all the forces that love freedom and peace,  to take practical positions in support of our people's  legitimate rights and to put an end to the rampage of Zionism,  which uses the defeatism of 'Arafat and his team -- this only  represents a slight minority of our people inside and outside  the occupied homeland -- as a pretext to entrench its occupation  of the Palestinian and Arab territories.    The alliance urges the exposure of the United States' use of  double standards and the extension of all sorts of support to  the Zionist enemy in order to develop its military arsenal and  to consider the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories as  disputed territories.    The alliance will resolutely continue its policy to topple  the Oslo-Washington agreement, strip 'Arafat and his team of  their popular legitimacy, rebuild the PLO's institutions on  democratic bases, and secure every means to prolong and escalate  the brave intifadah and its unity under the banner of the  unified national and Islamic unity of the intifadah.

0,FT931-3473 ,"FT931-3473 _AN-DCPCCADUFT 930316   FT  16 MAR 93 / Arts: Peter Grimes - Opera in concert      By MAX LOPPERT   The high point of Mstislav Rostropovich's current Britten Festival at the Barbican was intended to be the two concert performances of Peter Grimes. Up to a point, the intention was realised. On Sunday, the excellence of the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus was the ballast of the performance. Since the principal gain of such operas-in-concert is the host of opportunities offered for close-up examination of the score, the fine quality of the playing only enhanced admiration for the myriad fine detail of the music. A beautifully poised viola solo launching the Passacaglia offered a notable instance; so too the pithily characterful utterance of the Act 3 dance band, placed just close enough to allow the listener to note anew how subtly Britten worked its nippy pleasantries into the fabric of gathering dramatic tensions. A front-rank cast had been engaged: again, the pleasures of witnessing its most assured members in action fed one's admiration for the phrases Britten wrote for their characters. A singer's aim on such occasions should be the nicely judged infusion of characterisation into the smooth, clear delivery of notes. Such sharp-profiled singer-actors as John Dobson (Boles), John Connell (Swallow), Anne Collins (Mrs Sedley), Menai Davies (Auntie) and the sparky Jason Howard (Keene) - all experienced in the Grimes productions of Glyndebourne, ENO or Covent Garden - hit home their points with vivid economy. It was good to hear Ryland Davies taking a character role, the Rector, with such elegance. Platform entrances and exits added to the concert-drama - not, though, the addled boo-hoo-ing of the female chorus-member filling in for the boy apprentice. But the three principals, newcomers to their roles, revealed their inexperience in ways that sometimes rocked the concert-opera balance. Bryn Terfel's preening of his youthfully magnificent bass-baritone made only a superficial connection with Balstrode. Nancy Gustafson, dressed as a handsome West Coast belle with a glitter of diamonds in her hair, sang with a generalised warmth that too rarely found the centre of Ellen's precisely placed notes. It can be no easy matter to undertake one's first Grimes in the city where Peter Pears and Jon Vickers have held sway. The Canadian Ben Heppner, a heroic singer of uncommon intelligence, sensitivity and bounteous vocal gifts, struggled with those portions of the vocal writing most closely linked with Pears's tenorial idiosyncrasies. He will surely find his way deeper into the role, and should be fervently encouraged to do so - but, let us hope, under a conductor less far removed from the opera's 'real world' than Rostropovich. To be brutally frank, it seemed to me that on this showing, and for all the conductor's generosity and musicianly enthusiasm, he hasn't a clue of how Peter Grimes actually goes.

The National Council made this decision Wednesday,  when it defined the new penal rule for combatting criminal  organizations. This penal rule, which was approved--without  opposition--by 158 votes, should enter into force on 1 July.    Henceforth, bankers, trustees, or other business lawyers  will  be able to report their suspicions to the penal authorities  without any risk of violating banking or commercial secrecy. In  this way, they will avoid the dilemma of acting contrary to  either the ban on money laundering, or the obligation of  confidentiality toward their clients.    Hit Hard    Saint-Gall socialist Paul Rechsteiner proposed going further  by making it the duty of financiers to report their suspicions.  Switzerland acts as a center for international criminal  organizations. This is where we have to hit hard, he said.  Only the obligation to inform will make the law effective, Jean  Ziegler (Socialist Party, canton of Geneva) added. However, the  Greens and independents were the only ones who shared this point  of view.    The left wants to introduce the ""principle of informing""  that  was so dear to the former communist regimes, retorted Suzette  Sandoz (Liberal Party, canton of Vaud). Generally speaking, the  majority of Swiss feel that the right to inform is enough,  especially since an obligation to do so can be introduced at a  later stage with regard to the laundering of dirty money.  Federal Councillor Arnold Koller stressed that, in any case, no  provisions were to imply sanctions to bankers who do not talk.  The Rechsteiner proposal was defeated by 101 votes to 58.    Definition Contested    The left was also beaten on another point: the definition of  a criminal organization, whose members would be punishable by a  maximum of five years imprisonment. The following definition  was chosen: ""an organization which keeps its structure and  staff secret and whose purpose is to commit acts of criminal  violence or to procure income by criminal means.""    The socialists feel that this definition is too vague, since  it could be applied not only to the intended organized crime,  but also to small-time crime. It would take just three people  to plan to steal from a large store and you could talk about a  criminal organization, said Nils de Dardel (Socialist Party,  canton of Geneva). Hence, the proposal for a more detailed  definition, which includes the crime of corruption. However,  this was rejected by 121 votes to 36, while Mr. Koller made  assurances that no judge would take a small gang of hoodlums for  a criminal organization.    Burden of Proof On The Accused    The broader possibility of confiscating the illicit property  of criminal organizations was not contested. This should make  it possible to fight organized crime more effectively, namely by  depriving it of its operating capital. It will no longer be  necessary to establish from which specific infraction the  confiscated securities come. It will be up to the accused to  prove that his property was acquired legally.     "

All left-wing extremists want to abolish the existing state  and social order. In seeking that, they pursue various  ideological lines. At the end of 1993, almost 29,000 people  belonged to a multitude of left-wing extremist organizations and  groupings. This figure does not include the several thousand  supporters of the Marxist-Leninist positions assumed by the SED  [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] successor party, the ""Party  of Democratic Socialism"" (PDS). Marxist-Leninists, Trotskyists  and Marxist revolutionary formations that propagate class  struggle and revolution have 22,000 members. The anarchists  have about 6,000 members, including 5,000 independents who are  prepared to use violence.    The most significant terrorist organization, the ""Red Army  Faction"" (RAF), have once again demonstrated that it is prepared  to use violence with the bombing of the prison building at  Weiterstadt in Hesse. The report states: ""The shooting of a  police official at Bad Kleinen on 27 June during the attempt to  arrest RAF member Wolfgang Grams showed once more how dangerous  the underground command level members are."" The struggle over  what direction to adopt, one which became public, was unique for  the RAF. This finally led to a split between the RAF command  level and the majority of group members who were in prison and  ultimately resulted in collapse of the so-called ""prisoners  collective."" The report states that there are clear signs of  ""moves to form new terrorist groupings.""    The ""Revolutionary Cells"" (RZ) have continued the discussion  about concepts and conditions for future revolutionary policy.  A group that has emerged from the RZ has carried out terrorist  attacks.    The BfV officials further conclude that the greatest  potential for left-wing extremist violence is to be found among  independent anarchists. ""The popularity of these organization  is continuing to grow."" In contrast to independent anarchist  practice until now, which was based more on spontaneity and  hostility toward organizations, there are calls now for closer  coordination and organizational ties. Longer-term associations  have above all developed as a result of the so-called  ""antifascist"" struggle. Independent groupings' readiness to  engage in violence has not waned. They are responsible for the  majority of acts of violence that have a left-wing background.  ""Antifascism/antiracism"" has remained the main field of  activity and it has taken the form of militant action against  right-wing extremists or suspected right-wing extremists and  their structures as well against the ways in which asylum is  granted and amendments to asylum legislation.    Marxist-Leninist and other revolutionary Marxist  organizations have to a large extent assumed a more stable  character. By means of ""antifascism"" and campaigning for social  issues, they hope -- with only modest success -- to mobilize and  attract those concerned. According to the report, their  readiness to cooperate, extensively without ideological  reservations, with both elements from the independent scene and  those from RAF circles is ""remarkable."" The revolutionary  Marxists are focussing their attention on election year 1994.  They hope to improve their election prospects through links to  parties, alliances, and ""open lists."" Sections of the PDS are  also considering such moves.    According to the findings of the BfV officials, a  Marxist-Leninist association, the ""Communist Platform"" (KPF),  has consolidated its position within the PDS with the party's  knowledge and approval. It openly espouses the ""revolutionary  idea of the socialist alternative."" The report states that PDS  speaker Hanno Harnisch confirmed that the KPF does not want to  throw all the theoretical principles of communism overboard and  takes a ""glorified"" view of the history of socialism to some  extent. In June 1993, a representative of this tendency was  elected to the PDS Federal Board. The KPF also sees itself as a  bridge to other communist groupings. In an interview with the  DKP [German Communist Party] newspaper UNSERE ZEIT, PDS chairman  Lothar Bisky indicated that communists, including DKP members,  would be able to appear as candidates on the open PDS lists for  the 1994 elections. While the PDS has distanced itself from the  ""Stalinist"" MLPD [Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany], it has ""no  reservations about contacts with violent extremists such as the  independents.""    According to the 1993 findings, no progress is being made in  efforts to build a unified communist party for Germany.  However, revolutionary Marxist organizations maintain active  contacts with each other and with the PDS. Closer ties have  emerged between the ""Union of West German Communists"" (BWK) and  the PDS, but not between the ""German Communist Party"" (DKP), the  PDS ""Communist Platform,"" and the ""Communist Party of Germany,""  (KPD, based in Berlin) which was still founded in the days of  the GDR.       Right-Wing Extremism    The total number of organized and nonorganized right-wing  extremists hardly changed compared to 1992: According to the  BfV report, at the end of 1993, there were about 42,400 (42,700  in 1992) right-wing extremists in the FRG as well as 77 (82 in  1992) extremist right-wing organizations and other associations.  After making deductions for multiple membership, a total of  about 41,500 (41,900) right-wing extremists belong to these  organizations, including 5,600 (6,400 in 1992) militants,  particularly skinheads. About 950 (800 in 1992) neo-Nazis are  not members of organized associations.    There has been a slight decline in the overall number of  right-wing extremist acts of violence: It was established that  a total of 2,232 such offenses -- about 15 percent fewer than in  1992 (2,639) -- were committed in 1993. Of that number, 1,609  (2,277 in 1992) were motivated by hostility toward foreigners.  According to the Interior Ministry, the decline is due to the  resolute measures taken by the state, extending from greater  efforts on the part of the police force and the prosecution  service to the rapid conclusion of criminal proceedings. The  end of the debate on asylum has also caused the wave of violence  to subside.    However, the total number of violations of the law by  right-wing extremists has risen by 37 percent to 10,561 offenses  (7,684 in 1992). The report attributes the increase to a  greater readiness on the part of the population to report  offenses as well as police measures aimed ""at bringing light  into the darkness.""    The neo-Nazi scene has been made to feel ""very uncertain"" by  the seven bans on extremist right-wing associations that have  been imposed by interior ministries at the federal and laender  levels as well as numerous investigations and searches.  Applications for bans have been filed with the Federal  Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe against two parties (""Liberal  German Workers Party,"" FAP, and the ""National List,"" NL). In  February and July 1993, law enforcement measures were  implemented throughout the country against skinhead bands and  music companies as well as the producers and distributors of  right-extremist scene publications. Efforts by activists of  banned organizations to form new structures have only be  established in isolated cases. For example, supporters of the  ""German Alternative"" (DA) have tried to establish a new  organization called the ""German Nationalists"" (DN), which is  being kept under constant surveillance by the security  authorities.    Despite cooperation, right-wing extremist activities are  clearly fragmented at the regional level: While the FAP is  particularly active in North Rhine-Westphalia and the new  laender, the NL, which was formed by supporters of neo-Nazi  leader Michael Kuehnen, who died in 1991, concentrates on  Hamburg. The ""Direct Action/Central Germany"" (JF), which has  been active since later summer 1993, is primarily involved in  neo-Nazi and social revolutionary propaganda in Brandenburg and  Berlin. The ""Relief Organization for National Political  Prisoners and their Dependents"" has been shown to be a ""rallying  point for neo-Nazis."" With about 200 members, it is has one of  the largest memberships among neo-Nazi associations on the  right-wing extremist scene, which is greatly fragmented  organizationally.       Extremism Among Foreigners    Acts of violence committed by foreign extremists and  foreigners associations still pose a ""considerable"" threat to  the security of the FRG. Despite a slight drop in the number of  members and supporters of such associations, the security  situation in Germany has not been ""defused,"" states the BfV  report in its chapter on foreigners. The acts of violence  committed in 1993 by foreign extremists rose to 66 (53 in 1992);  five people died as a result.    According to the BfV authorities, at the end of 1993, 38,950  (39,800 in 1992) people belonged to ""foreigners' associations  that were actively extremist or considerably influenced by  extremism,"" including 6,800 supporters of organizations from the  ""Kurdish and Turkish areas of observation"" that are banned in  Germany. Turkish and Kurdish extremism is the most prevalent:  The BfV also mentions 1,750 Arabs, 1,300 Iranians, and 2,500  others.    In 1993, a total of 195 acts (141 in 1992) of violence were  registered. They included 66 (53) serious acts of violence such  as offenses, bombings, arson attacks. The most common act of  violence (60 offenses) among the remaining 129 offenses is  damage to property involving the considerable use of force.    The BfV describes the ""Workers Party of Kurdistan"" (PKK), --  it was banned in Germany in November 1993 -- which is seeking an  independent Kurdish state and, according to the report, is  openly waging a terrorist campaign against the Turkish state, as  ""by far the most militant organization"" in Germany. Compared to  previous years, there has been a ""marked"" increase in the PKK's  readiness to use violence in Germany and it is linked to the  escalation of the conflict in Turkey. ""Its violent activities  have assumed increasingly serious forms and have considerably  impaired German security interests."" In this context, the BfV  report mentions the PKK attack on the Turkish Consulate General  in Munich --a trial is currently in progress -- and 50 attacks  on Turkish facilities in numerous German towns. In addition,  the PKK has collected money in Germany for the struggle in  Turkey ""partially by using blackmail.""    The report also includes under Turkish extremism the  left-wing extremist organization ""Revolutionary Left"" (Devrimci  Sol), which was also banned in 1993, the Turkish ""Communist  Party"" (Marxist-Leninist), the Islamic extremist ""Association of  Islamic Associations and Communities"" (ICCB) in Cologne, the  Islamic ""Association for a New World View in Europe"" (AMGT).  The last two groupings have about 19,000 members.    The Gaza-Jericho accord between Israel and the PLO has also  prompted very differing reactions among the Palestinians living  in Germany. For example, in leaflets distributed in Germany,  the ""Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine"" has been  sharply critical of the agreement and emphatically rejected it.  The ""Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine"" has  expressed itself in similar terms.    In the case of extremism among Iranians, the BfV draws a  distinction between supporters and opponents of the present  Iranian Government. With regard to the latter, it has been  established that the collapse and organizational and ideological  disorientation of the Iranian opposition is continuing.    The only opposition group worth mentioning is the social  revolutionary ""Organization of the People's Mojahedin of Iran,""  whose supporters have also engaged in ""vociferous propaganda"" at  several larger demonstrations in Germany. On the subject of the  conflict between the peoples of former Yugoslavia, the report  states that in 1993 in Germany, there were ""threats and physical  violence"" on a massive scale including murder (20 March 1993 in  Kehl in Baden- Wuerttemberg). In general, it is possible to  ascertain a radicalization among the Bosnian Moslems living in  Germany.    The number of periodicals distributed in the FRG by  extremist  foreigners associations fell from 96 (1992) to 68. Fifty-four  of them were published by extremist left-wing groups, 11 by  extremist Islamic organizations, and three by extreme  nationalist groups.    In connection with extremism on the part of foreigners, the  BfV points out ""that the overwhelming majority of the more than  6 million fellow foreign citizens reject extremist behavior and  do not want to be involved with extremist political groupings on  a long-term basis."" At the same time, however, the marked  increase in the number of acts of violence indicates that this  tendency has ""not simultaneously led to a decrease in moves  endangering security.""    Counterintelligence    The FRG's political, economic, and technological importance  is of continued interest to foreign intelligence services.  According to the BfV report, 1,816 investigations into treason  and the endangering of external security were instituted in  1993. Arrest warrants were issued against 31 people; they had  all been recruited by the former GDR intelligence service.    To perform its tasks, the FRG counterintelligence service  also requires information on the structure and development of  foreign intelligence services. The BfV focuses primarily on the  Russian Federation and other Eastern European states. Following  the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation had  sought to base its civilian and military intelligence services  and the Russian Security (MBR) on principles appropriate to a  rule-of-law state. However, the Russian services are still to  find their final form and could not make full use of their  operational possibilities. In 1993, information gathering  conducted by the Federation particularly concentrated on the  economy, science, and technology and above all on the field of  military strategy and technology. In addition, the Russian  services sought to collect information on political parties, the  strength of parties, and the development of extremism in Germany.    In 1993, the German counterintelligence service concentrated  on secret service activities of the former GDR. It was possible  to uncover almost the entire network of agents operated by the  Foreign Intelligence Collection Main Administration (HVA) of the  former Ministry of State Security (MfV).    In general, the federal ministry states in the BfV report  that recently intelligence services have been operating more  cautiously to avoid foreign complications as much as possible.     "

However, hope for an immediate provision of Belarusian citizens  with tricolored Russian banknotes did not come true. This  hampers Mr. Kebich's campaign to a great extent.    Relations with Russia and the forthcoming monetary union are  the main topics at meetings of the prime minister and his  electorate. They were also much discussed at Mr. Kebich's  meeting with professors of institutes of higher education in  Minsk, which was held at the Belarusian State University on 12  May. The present stage of the implementation of the  above-mentioned agreement was assessed by the prime minister in  the following way:    ""Nine articles out of 12 are already in force. The most  essential article of this agreement concerns the lifting of  custom duties, quotas, and tariffs. Practically, it means that  prices for imported Russian goods will be lowered by about 25-30  percent. Consequently, this leads to a decrease in production  costs and to a possibility of falling retail prices. However,  it is undesirable to decrease retail prices today. Why?  Because even at current prices, a great flood of goods  (especially foodstuffs) outside of Belarus exists. Therefore,  our task is, while preserving the same retail prices, to  increase wages. This is a more proper way, and we will follow  it.""    ""With regard to other articles of the agreement, I should  say  that we need to bring some legislative acts in line with  legislative acts of the Russian Federation. However, I will  tell you honestly: During our talks with the Russian leadership,  one could sense an underlying sentiment: `We will wait and see  who will become your president...' The document signed by Oleg  Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, specifies the  term. Nine articles come in force before 31 July. Note that  this term was chosen not accidentally... Let us say  straightforwardly: If the presidential elections are a bust,  this may prevent the union from being formed.""    In general, during the meeting, Mr. Kebich frequently  accentuated the delicacy of relations with our eastern neighbor  and their tendency to fluctuations due to seemingly  insignificant factors:    ""There was a mention of our victory over Moscow regiments  near Orsha in 1514, and Russia cut off its gas supplies. This  was not accidental. We still owe debts to Russia for gas -- but  gas supplies continue... There was a mention of Belarusian  claims to Bransk and Smolensk Oblasts, for Vilnius region -- and  we received the next warning: `We will halt gas supplies if you  do not start paying.' Politics know no trifles. One has to be  very careful about politics and assess the situation very  accurately.""    Understandably, Mr. Kebich himself has never made any such  statements on the victory near Orsha or some territorial claims.  Apparently, he had in mind statements and actions by the  Belarusian Popular Front...    The prime minister firmly cut himself off from the radical  ideas of both the ""right"" and the ""left."" He promised  stability, consequence, and continual progress after his victory  in the elections.     "

Mexico would be able to impose countervailing duties on all US flat steel producers if the claims are upheld. Its two flat steel producers, Hysla and Altos Hornos, brought the case against USX, National, LTV and Bethlehem, and two US trading companies. They claim the US companies have been selling hot-rolled, cold-rolled and plate-in-coil steel below cost, making it impossible for the Mexicans to compete fairly. Mexico, unlike the US, has been unwilling until now to use its anti-dumping laws.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

Sooner or later it would have become  public property. We decided that sooner was better than later.    We know that, under a government edict [ukaz],  recommissioning work has been under way at Metsamor AES [Nuclear  Electric Power Station] for over a year now. Moreover, despite  the recommendations of international organizations (the  International Atomic Energy Agency, Framatome, and so on) it is  envisaged that demothballing will be carried out within a  compressed time scale. This was a forced decision, because  Armenia has been facing an energy disaster for several years  now, and the shipment of energy sources across Azerbaijani and  Georgian territory has been made extremely difficult because of  terrorist acts and the general unstable situation in the region.  But the blood in our veins runs cold from the risk factors  listed in the document.    The reactors at the Metsamor AES (of the water-cooled,  water-moderated 440/230 type) are known for their imperfection  and unreliability in operation. Furthermore, in the event of an  accident there are no protection measures in the form of a  containment vessel or underground drop-down mechanisms  [mekhanizmy podzemnogo obrusheniya]. The problem of burying the  radioactive waste remains an open one. Under the station there  is a multilevel artesian well from which water is distributed  throughout the region. Bearing in mind the current military  situation in the region, the danger of terrorist acts is quite  real.    The document, signed by S. Shaginyan, chairman of the  Armenian commission for the protection of the environment and  natural resources, says the following: ""Total economic blockade  has put Armenia under the threat of extinction.... Sensible  warnings about the danger of starting up the AES receive no  response. The situation has now gotten out of control, and the  threat of an ecological explosion has become real.""    In the light of all the aforementioned risk factors it  becomes clear that starting up the AES cannot be considered  Armenia's internal affair. Georgian ecologists are ready to  sound the alarm. We possess another document, signed by  Professor Tamaz Chelidze, director of the Georgian Academy of  Sciences Geophysics Institute. It says that, according to a  seismic zoning map in existence since 1989, the site of the  Armenian AES falls into the category of a zone with a 9-point  seismic risk. This figure speaks for itself. We can add to it  that the AES is capable of meeting only 25 percent of Armenia's  needs -- and then only for electricity; other energy sources  will still have to be imported. So it is not too clear whether  starting it up is economically advantageous.    But something else is clear: When a baby dies from the cold  in front of your eyes (and this has happened many times in both  Armenia and Georgia), you will not only start up the AES but you  will also open up a Pandora's box. But maybe there is still a  chance to take safety measures?     "

Even if their predictions are true, astrologers do not mean  to tell the truth. Their predictions are lies based on  probability, which could, by sheer coincidence, be true on  certain occasions.    By the same token, traitors are also liars, even if they  tell  the truth. One might hear nice words and admire them. However,  once one finds out who uttered these words, their sense is lost  and their beauty turns into insults and vulgar expressions.    ""We have fought honorably, and we make peace honorably.""  Beautiful words, right? You will laugh when you find out who  said these words and when. The speaker is Hafiz al-Asad and the  occasion is his meeting with his new lord, Clinton.    It is common knowledge that Hafiz al-Asad had no honor on  two  occasions during which fighting was truly honorable. The first  is the June war, when al-Asad was defense minister, and gave the  Golan as a gift to the Zionist entity. The second is the  October war when Damascus was about to be captured had it not  been for the chivalrous Iraqi leadership and its heroic army  that came to the rescue. The Iraqi army removed the enemy and  drew up a plan for attack and infiltration into the enemy's  defenses. However, only hours before carrying out the plan, it  was surprised that the ""honorable fighter"" had accepted a  cease-fire, because its premeditated objective was ""provocation""  rather than liberation.    We do not want to do injustice to the man. Therefore, we  testify that he displayed ""honor"" on many occasions in which  fighting was not honorable.    He had the ""honor"" of destroying the city of Hamah and  killing 25,000 of its people and supervising the massacre of the  Tadmur desert prison.    He had the ""honor"" of killing Palestinians and the national  movement in Lebanon since the 'Ayn al-Rummanah events in 1975  and up until now.    He had the ""honor"" of watching, and sometimes assisting in,  the Zionist army's attacks on Lebanon.    He had the ""honor"" of watching the massacre of the  Palestinians in Sabra and Shatila.    The highest order of ""honor"" won by Hafiz al-Asad was  through  two stands in which he expressed his ""national honor"" which he  brags about more than extremist nationalist leaders.    The first, when he ""honorably"" sided by the Iranian  aggression against Iraq for eight years. The second, when he  had the ""honor"" of participating, along with the allied forces,  in the 30-state aggression against Iraq.    A person displaying all this ""honor"" in his fights will  definitely have the ""honor"" of throwing himself into the lap of  the cousins (Rabin and Peres). Even if the Golan returns  through a disgraceful settlement, al-Asad still bears the  disgrace of surrendering it and leaving it for 27 years without  liberation. We are here talking about usurped Syrian Arab  territory, and not Jerusalem, Baysan, or Nazareth.    Indeed, traitors are liars, even if they tell the truth.     "

(?In this regard), as a simple  voter, (Assa Ovono) cannot appeal for the annulment of the  entire 5 December 1993 poll.

We therefore decide:    Article 1. The appeal for annulment of the results of the 5  December 1993 poll filed by (Assa Ovono) is not receivable.    Article 2.

In light of the atmosphere of hope and optimism  which has begun to prevail in the country, the General Committee  of the General People's Congress [GPC] would like to extend its  warmest congratulations to the lofty Yemeni masses on the  occasion of the signing, in heroic Aden today, of a document of  pledge and accord to build a modern Yemeni state by parties to  the Political Forces Dialogue.    The GPC considers this step a crowning of the sincere  national efforts to put a decisive end to the political crisis  and its regrettable repercussions, which have negatively  reflected on the lives of the citizens and harmed the homeland's  interests and stability.    Hence, the GPC's General Committee welcomes the positive  results that have been achieved and stresses its adherence to  the contents of the Document of Pledge and Accord. It, along  with all the forces of goodwill in the country, hopes that this  approved national step will be the beginning of a translation  and achievement of all the aspirations of our people. These  aspirations include maintaining the unity of the homeland and  reinforcing the pluralistic democratic experiment; building the  modern Yemeni state--the state of law and order--as well as the  constitutional institutions founded on justice, democracy, and  respect for human rights; entrenching the bases of local  government which are based on administrative and financial  decentralization; seeking to alleviate the suffering of the  citizens and securing their daily life requirements; and  achieving a cultural awakening in modern Yemen.    Moreover, the GPC also expresses its deep appreciation for  the Political Forces Dialogue Committee for its extensive  efforts and the formidable difficulties it faced to achieve this  document, which is an obligating pledge or (?contract) for  everyone. It is a document that should be adhered to and put  into practice by everyone to shoulder his responsibility to  achieve what is contained in this document as far as  implementation mechanisms and timetables are concerned.    The GPC continues to be loyal to Yemen and its people and is  concerned about unity, democracy, and national accord. It has  been guided by wisdom and patience in order to remove all the  dangers and challenges facing this homeland. Moreover,  throughout the crisis, the GPC's stands have been marked by  national responsibility, good sense, and self-restraint. It  strongly refused to be drawn into the perils of escalation which  harms the homeland and its unity, the democratic formula, and  the citizens' interests. Hence, the GPC announces that it will  not hesitate to exert every effort and join hands with all those  who are concerned about Yemen--the Yemen of unity and  democracy--in order to triumph for the issues of the homeland  and the people, to practically implement all agreements, and to  move our homeland toward a better and prosperous future in  fulfillment of all our people's aspirations and ambitions of  progress, growth, and prosperity under the banner of unity,  democracy, and peace.

The National Council made this decision  Wednesday [2 March], when it defined the new penal rule for  combatting criminal organizations. This penal rule, which was  approved -- without opposition -- by 158 votes, should enter  into force on 1 July.    Henceforth, bankers, trustees, or other business lawyers  will  be able to report their suspicions to the penal authorities  without any risk of violating banking or commercial secrecy. In  this way, they will avoid the dilemma of acting contrary to  either the ban on money laundering, or the obligation of  confidentiality toward their clients.    Hit Hard    Saint-Gall socialist Paul Rechsteiner proposed going further  by making it the duty of financiers to report their suspicions.  Switzerland acts as a center for international criminal  organizations. This is where we have to hit hard, he said.  Only the obligation to inform will make the law effective, Jean  Ziegler (Socialist Party, canton of Geneva) added. However, the  Greens and independents were the only ones who shared this point  of view.    The left wants to introduce the ""principle of informing""  that  was so dear to the former communist regimes, retorted Suzette  Sandoz (Liberal Party, canton of Vaud). Generally speaking, the  majority of Swiss feel that the right to inform is enough,  especially since an obligation to do so can be introduced at a  later stage with regard to the laundering of dirty money.  Federal Councillor Arnold Koller stressed that, in any case, no  provisions were to imply sanctions to bankers who do not talk.  The Rechsteiner proposal was defeated by 101 votes to 58.    Definition Contested    The left was also beaten on another point: the definition of  a criminal organization, whose members would be punishable by a  maximum of five years imprisonment. The following definition  was chosen: ""an organization which keeps its structure and  staff secret and whose purpose is to commit acts of criminal  violence or to procure income by criminal means.""    The socialists feel that this definition is too vague, since  it could be applied not only to the intended organized crime,  but also to small-time crime. It would take just three people  to plan to steal from a large store and you could talk about a  criminal organization, said Nils de Dardel (Socialist Party,  canton of Geneva). Hence, the proposal for a more detailed  definition, which includes the crime of corruption. However,  this was rejected by 121 votes to 36, while Mr. Koller made  assurances that no judge would take a small gang of hoodlums for  a criminal organization.    Burden of Proof On The Accused    The broader possibility of confiscating the illicit property  of criminal organizations was not contested. This should make  it possible to fight organized crime more effectively, namely by  depriving it of its operating capital. It will no longer be  necessary to establish from which specific infraction the  confiscated securities come. It will be up to the accused to  prove that his property was acquired legally.     "
0,FT932-5889 ,"FT932-5889 _AN-DFBBWAG2FT 930601   FT  01 JUN 93 / Accounting rules 'will have legal status'      By ANDREW JACK   THE NEW accounting standards being developed by the Accounting Standards Board have the force of law, according to a decision to be published by the board this week. The decision - a legal opinion by Ms Mary Arden, a senior barrister specialising in commercial matters who was recently appointed a judge - marks the first time the power of accounting standards-setters has been explicitly granted legal standing in the UK. The standards being issued by both the board and its 'urgent issues' task force are likely to be recognised by the courts as authoritative, she says. The application of accounting standards has until now been unclear because they have rarely been tested in the courts. The board's predecessor, the Accounting Standards Committee, was dissolved in 1990 because companies rejected its authority and refused to abide by its rules, the statements of standard accounting practice. Ms Arden's opinion was written in April and is to be included in a chapter of the board's statement of principles, the framework on which it is building a wide range of new and controversial standards. She says a new section, Number 256, inserted into the 1985 Companies Act, gives authority to accounting standards-setting bodies, which have been recognised in the 1989 Companies Act. The acts reinforce the principle that accounts should give 'a true and fair view' of a company's state of affairs. Ms Arden emphasises that the true and fair principle is a 'dynamic concept . . . subject to continuous rebirth' but says the courts will interpret it using evidence of the practices and views of accountants. This increasingly means considering the rules laid down by the Accounting Standards Board, she says. It reflects the fact that, unlike its predecessor, the board's membership and funding are drawn from the government and companies, as well as from the accountancy profession. Ms Arden cites the board's official foreword to accounting standards, which claims that standards are drafted after extensive investigation and consultation. Even though the urgent issues task force - which acts quickly to fill gaps in standards - is not recognised in law, she argues that it will also be held in considerable standing by the courts. Ms Arden cites in support of her opinion the one accounting standards case tested in court. That was the 1987 Lloyd Cheyham v Littlejohn case, in which the judge ruled standards of the Accounting Standards Committee were 'very strong evidence as to what is the proper standard which should be adopted'. Ms Arden's opinion is the first published decision on accounting standards since one she wrote with Mr Leonard Hoffman - also now a judge - in 1984.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Yesterday rescue workers continued to comb the wreckage for two Israeli embassy officials and up to eight other victims believed still buried under the rubble. The group said in Beirut Tuesday's attack was carried out by a suicide bomber, named Abu Yasser, an Argentine convert to Islam, in reprisal for the Israeli assassination last month of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the Hizbollah leader. Islamic Jihad is an off-shoot of the Lebanese Hizbollah, loyal to Iranian hardliner Hojatolislam Ali Akbar Mohtashemi. The claim, resonant with terms used over the past nine years in other Islamic Jihad claims of responsibility for bombings and kidnappings, demonstrated for the first time the ability of the fundamentalist cell to strike far outside the Middle East. The Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires yesterday denied that Tehran played any part in Tuesday's attack. It issued a statement 'categorically' denying any type of relation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and that event.' It said Iran 'lamented' the bombing and expressed its 'condolences' to the government and people of Argentina. Mr Jose Luis Manzano, Argentina's interior min-ister, blamed the attack on 'extremists from abroad who received logistical support' from local groups. Argentina has Latin America's biggest Jewish community, numbering about 300,000-400,000, as well as a large Arab community, whose most prominent member is President Carlos Menem, the son of Syrian immigrants. Argentine officials confirmed that a car bomb loaded with 100kg of explosives was used to virtually demolish the embassy. The attack is likely to prompt swift Israeli retaliation against targets in Lebanon. Even before the Islamic Jihad claim, senior Israeli officials said they would inflict 'painful punishment' on those who carried out the attack and those who sent them. Officials said the bombing would not cause Israel to withdraw from the Middle East peace talks. Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, said a 'Damascus-Tehran axis' supported acts like the embassy bombing and the killing earlier this month in a car bomb explosion in Ankara of an Israeli embassy security officer. In Damascus, President Hafez al-Assad denied Syria had been involved in either this bombing or any such acts and said he did not know who was responsible for the explosion.

Wages for the Workers, and the Sack for the Bureaucrats""]    [Text] About 200 delegates from 37 oblasts, 6 republics,  and 2 krays, as well as 175 delegates of the ""Working Capital""  congress from Moscow and the Moscow region, participated in the  Second Congress of the ""Working Russia"" All-Russia  Sociopolitical Movement, which took place 23 April in the city  of Reutovo, Moscow Oblast. Viktor Anpilov's report ""On the  Socioeconomic Situation in Russia,"" the coreports by well-known  scientists Boris Khorev and Aleksey Sergeyev, and the delegates'  speeches noted that further enforced capitalization of the  country will exacerbate the crisis, compound the already  desperate situation in which the workers find themselves, and  turn Russia into a colony of the developed capitalist countries.    The congress expressed an unequivocal view: Only a complete  change of the country's political and economic policy and the  restoration of workers' power from top to bottom in the shape of  soviets will extricate society from the crisis.    ""Working Russia"" has always been against private property  and  the implementation of the predatory privatization program which  has brought poverty, unemployment, and social inequality to the  majority of the working people. Each increase in the percentage  of the country's unemployed should be matched by an identical  reduction in Russia's administrative apparatus, which has  increased greatly and exceeds the number of administrators in  the whole of the Soviet Union's structures, the delegates said.  Another slogan which was ardently supported was: ""Wages for  the workers, the sack for the president and the bureaucrats!""    The congress adopted a package of documents, having  confirmed  its policy to organize a general political strike in Russia.  Advocating peace and stability in society, the delegates  demanded that the powers that be respect existing laws and that  President Yeltsin be dismissed immediately. A public committee  to investigate the tragedy of 3-4 October was formed and Russian  People's Deputy Yuriy Slobodkin will head it.    The congress supported the ""Working Capital's"" decision to  nominate Viktor Anpilov as a Russian presidential candidate.  Anpilov himself is categorically against the institution of the  presidency which is incompatible with true democracy, and is  joining the battle for the post of president with the sole aim  of abolishing the institution of the presidency which is hateful  to the people and bringing back the soviets of working people as  his very first act if he is elected.    Oleg Shenin, chairman of the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU  Council Political Executive Committee; Timo Lahdenmaeki,  chairman of the Finnish Communist Workers Party; Eric Trevet,  general secretary of the new Communist Party of England;  Yeoryios Mavrikos, member of the Communist Party of Greece  Central Committee, Sergio Rubens, member of the Brazilian ""8  October"" Revolutionary Movement Coordination Committee; Bill  Doris, member of the U.S. Workers' World Party Central  Committee; and others ardently welcomed ""Working Russia's""  heroic struggle to resurrect the Soviet Union, socialism, and  Soviet power.    ""Working Russia"" called on all working people to hold a May  Day demonstration under the slogans: ""Authorities Without  Criminals,"" ""Life Without Speculators,"" ""Stable Prices,"" and  ""Unity of the USSR's Peoples.""

0,FT932-6233 ,"FT932-6233 _AN-DE3ARAALFT 930529   FT  29 MAY 93 / Italy fears renewed attacks      By ROBERT GRAHAM      ROME   ITALY yesterday prepared for possible further terrorist attacks after Thursday's car bomb explosion in Florence which killed five people and seriously damaged one of the two main wings of the famous Uffizi gallery. The Italian government yesterday said the mafia was behind the attack, but did not exclude the possibility that other organisations could also be involved in a determined campaign of terror to destabilise the country. In yesterday's parliamentary debate a number of senators questioned whether dissident elements in the security services and former members of the P2 secret masonic lodge, behind terrorist acts during the 1970s and early 1980s, were involved in the incidents. The authorities believe they are up against a group or groups with a well-defined strategy, unafraid to take lives or attack priceless artistic treasures. Mr Nicola Mancino, the interior minister, told parliament the mafia had a hand in wanting to create a climate of tension. Their aim was to distract the authorities from their increasingly successful battle against organised crime. He did not rule out links with international organised crime The Italian cabinet yesterday agreed to provide L30bn (Pounds 13.16m) in immediate funds to ensure the Uffizi could open to the public as soon as possible, albeit on a limited basis. The authorities have revealed no hard proof of mafia involvement in this bombing or that in Rome on May 14. Mr Mancino said links existed between the car bombing in Florence and the one n Rome which injured 23 people. In both instances forensic experts have found traces of the same explosive material also used in another unexplained act of terrorism, the bombing of the Naples-Milan train on December 23, 1984 killing 15 and injuring 200. The interior minister said the Rome explosion occured on national police day while the Uffizi bomb went off on the day interior ministers were meeting to discuss combating the drugs trade. The Rome bombing was a message primarily directed against an Italian audience, while the Florence explosion was intended to produce reverberations world-wide, he suggested. He also maintained the bombings were too close together to be coincidental. The car used to carry more than 100kg of explosive was apparently stolen the day before, as was a second get-away vehicle. Mafia experts said this was contrary to normal mafia practice. In the four major terrorist acts since 1974, the courts have failed to pin final responsibility on anyone. Only this week the 50,000 page file was closed on the May 28, 1974 bombing in Brescia (8 dead, 90 injured) after eight separate inconclusive trials since 1978. In Florence yesterday unions organised a protest and a crowd of over 100,000 heard calls for people to refuse to be cowed by the threat of terrorism. Elsewhere in Italy stoppages were staged in solidarity with the victims.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

The BAKHTAR Information Agency political  commentator writes:    The shameful past of the leaders of the conspirators against  the Islamic state, and the savagery they inflicted on our nation  over the previous 14 years and over the past one and half years,  has made all heroic mojahedin of the country join in fighting  against the lackeys of the aliens after the declaration of jihad  and to eliminate the last pockets of Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin's  lackey militia. National traitor Karmal, who has once again  embarked on conspiracy and crime, is the most defamed element.  He was an instrument in the hands of the Russian aggressors and  became a tool for their invasion of our country. His puppet  force was crushed under the feet of the mojahedin, and he has  become a shameful figure in history.    Golboddin Hekmatyar has resorted to numerous coups and  allied  himself each time with an anti-national element. Over the one  year and eight months since the Islamic revolution, he has  washed the city of Kabul in blood many times, and each time has  come up with various pretexts to satisfy his ill intentions.  This time he has allied himself with national traitor Karmal  and has revealed his features.    Abdorrashid Dostam, a lackey of the communists and the  murderer of [words indistinct], has this time followed the  instruction of national traitor Karmal and hatched a conspiracy  [passage indistinct]    Karmal-Golboddin's defamed and anti-Islamic militia fire  rockets and drop bombs on civilians and specific government  installations in retaliation for their defeats. These acts,  which are a product of their savage characteristics, have been  used against our Muslim nation in the past as well. However,  one thing is clear to all: The 14 years of aerial bombardment by  the invaders made the mojahedin braver and increased the  resistance of our Muslim people, and now again these  bombardments have increased the anger of our people and  consolidated the ranks of the mojahedin.    There is one more issue. Some people make efforts to  lengthen the life of the conspirators by trying to arrange a  cease-fire. Now that they are on the verge of definite  elimination, any kind [word indistinct] of cease-fire will mean  giving further opportunity to their remnants. Past experience  also shows that Golboddin Hekmatyar was saved from certain  defeat every time by his foreign supporters.    It is true that if matters could be resolved through peace,  this would be better than fighting. But only the total  elimination of Karmal-Dostam's militia and the resolute decision  of Golboddin not to resume fighting can be acceptable to the  mojahedin. All those who have lost their lives during the  confrontation against this conspiracy and those who fight in the  first line of the armed jihad ask all those who have intervened  in this direction and all state and military office holders not  to accept this cease-fire without the elimination of the  Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin militia. The country must be cleansed  of the dirt of the remnants of the national traitor Karmal in  order that our faithful people can live a peaceful life.     "

There may be more, but, in the investigation being conducted  by the committee, Barrenechea states that it has detected the  existence of 21 types of torture and three phases of altered  behavior of the persons, aimed at extracting handwritten  self-incriminating statements, or statements that involve other  persons in specified acts.    ""The tortures identified by the committee include beatings,  electric prods, the `submarine,' `bell,' and `pig' treatments,  special blows to the genitals, and raping of men and women,"" he  said. He added that violence of the sexual type is the most  frequently used.    Until Turned Into Limp Flesh    Based on data provided by testimonies, Barrenechea explained  that the techniques designed to extract confessions involve  three evaluation phases. The first, aimed at  uncommunicativeness, consists of unlimited physical violence and  threats of violence against members of the victim's family, and  it is conducted by Bolivian torturers.    In the second phase, the system of tortures is refined and  is  conducted with greater discernment and sophistication, because  it is done by foreign experts. In the third phase, the intensity  of the tortures is diminished, but techniques are applied that  are designed to break routines and create situations of mental  derangement.    One of the torturers assumes a paternal role, pretends  identification with the victim's problem, and persuades the  victim to sign anything. During the persuasion interval, other  methods are also used, such as preventing sleep for 17 days, or  keeping the victim seated and tied to a chair for five  consecutive days, without permitting movement even for tending  to physiological needs, all the while pressing the victim with  repeated questions.    ""Those acting the role of psychologists take part in this  phase, asking the same question or others some 50 to 500 times  to detect associations and verify whether what is being said by  the victim, converted now into a lump of limp flesh, is the  truth or a lie,"" said Barrenechea, adding: ""Pressure is also  applied scientifically, and we are trying to determine who are  the doctors responsible for prescribing the dosages of torture  and pressures the victim is able to take.""    Barrenechea stated that after such treatment, the victim's  sole desire is to die and get it all over with rather than  continue living in constant dread, and that this state is used  to get the victim to sign a confession and incriminate other  persons.    ""We have found a constant in all of these interrogations:  The  victim is handed a list of names of persons that includes those  of many journalists and politicians,"" he said, adding that the  victims sign what they are told to sign, and even incriminate  themselves, in order to end the tortures, despite the fact that  Bolivian law does not accept such documents as valid.    ""The committee is now also investigating why the judges are  not accepting the evidence being presented by detainees  attesting to their having been compelled to incriminate  themselves and others by torture,"" he said.    A Power That Vies With That of Government and State    Barrenechea stated that the personnel conducting the  tortures  are ""professionals,"" and that they have not been removed since  the era of dictatorships, and even previous to that, because  they ""include persons from the first MNR [Nationalist  Revolutionary Movement] period of rule. These are persons who  have worked with the MNR's system of political control, the  dictatorships of Banzer and Garcia Meza, the Patriotic Agreement  government, and the present government. They are apparently  irremovable persons with international specialization,"" he said.    The existence of that apparatus specializing in repression,  said Barrenechea, is constant, regardless of political regimes,  and has become a quasi-autonomous structure beyond the control  of even the executive branch of the government.    ""This is why the committee is working to reconcile the state  with civil society, and to prevent the committing of these  utterly savage acts in the name of the law,"" he said.    Terrorist Unions    The entire description mentioned above is drawn from the  testimony heard by the Committee on Human Rights from 36 persons  who were detained for acts of terrorism. They are members of  subversive groups such as Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army [EGTK],  ""Zarate Willka,"" the Nestor Paz Zamora Command [CNPZ], and the  Army of National Liberation [ELN], who appeared before the  committee last week in compliance with a summons issued by the  Chamber of Deputies.    ""This is part of an investigation of 50 persons charged with  acts of terrorism, 10 of whom are in Chonchocoro, 11 in San  Pedro, five in Posta, five in the Women's Correction Center, and  four in prison in Cochabamba. Ten other persons are fugitives at  large, one is a `missing person,' and four were released after  being detained.""    Upon completing its evaluation, which will address elements  of what is stated in the above paragraphs, the committee will  issue a report, summon torturers, and police and judicial  officials who permitted the violation of human and  constitutional rights, and inspect the houses of detention.

0,FT923-8482 ,"FT923-8482 _AN-CHMBDADJFT 920811   FT  11 AUG 92 / Government outlaws loyalist UDA      By DAVID OWEN   THE GOVERNMENT yesterday outlawed the Ulster Defence Association, the largest loyalist paramilitary organisation in Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'satisfied that the UDA is actively and primarily engaged in the commission of criminal, terrorist acts and so merits proscription'. For those purposes it acted as the Ulster Freedom Fighters, he said. The ban, which came into effect at midnight, means it is an offence to be a UDA member, to solicit funds or membership for the organisation, or to participate in any acts of the organisation. The UDA is the fourth loyalist group to be proscribed - the UFF is already banned, along with the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commandos. The move was broadly welcomed in London and Dublin and by nationalists in Northern Ireland. It was strongly criticised by Unionists on the grounds that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, was not also banned. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said he did not understand why Sinn Fein 'which is also an organisation deeply involved in sectarian killings of Protestants' was not proscribed. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the decision not to ban Sinn Fein showed that the UDA ban was a sop to the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland security minister, said Sinn Fein's status was also kept under review. 'Sinn Fein is an organisation which does not condemn violence, which is thoroughly reprehensible and repugnant,' he said. 'If the criteria for banning an organisation under the emergency provisions were to apply to Sinn Fein then we would, in the course of a review, come to a different decision from what we have come to at the moment.' The UDA is thought to be responsible for the deaths of about a third of the more than 2,000 civilians killed in Northern Ireland in the past 23 years. It said yesterday that it would always be there to 'defend its community'. Six nationalist terrorist groups are proscribed - the IRA, the Irish National Liberation Army and four smaller groups.

[applause]    In greeting the New Year, I extend warm congratulations and  warm greetings to all the people, including our working class,  cooperative peasants, intellectuals, and People's Army officers  and men, who, with boundless loyalty to the party and the leader  [suryong], are devotedly waging the struggle for the  chuche-oriented socialist cause. [applause]    I extend warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings to  brothers and sisters in South Korea and Korean residents in  Japan and all the other compatriots overseas who are positively  waging the struggle to peacefully reunify the fatherland.  [applause]    I extend New Year greetings to the progressive peoples and  friends on the five continents who treasure justice and peace  and aspire for an independent new world. [applause]    The year 1993 was a historic year when the justness of our  party's independent revolutionary lines and the might of chuche  Korea were displayed powerfully. [applause]    Last year, the imperialists and reactionaries more viciously  than ever maneuvered to isolate and stifle [korip chilsik] our  Republic and obliterate [malsal] our socialist cause. As a  result, the situation in our country has become very tense.    When a stern trial faced the fatherland and revolution, our  party, in response to the prevailing situation, took the bold  self-defensive measure of declaring a state of semi-war in the  entire country, all the people, and the entire Army and called  on all the people to break through head-on [matpadanagamyo] the  enemy's challenge with the revolutionary spirit and militant  spirit -- which was displayed during the period of the stern  fatherland liberation war -- and score great upsurges in  socialist construction.    Our heroic People's Army officers and men and all the  people,  who accepted the party's militant call with their hearts, rose  up like one in the struggle to defend national independence and  the revolutionary feats with confidence in a sure victory and  soaring spirits, crushed the enemy's challenge and aggression  maneuvers, and honorably defended the dignity and safety of the  socialist fatherland, thus fully displaying the indomitable  spirit of chuche Korea. [applause]    This is the victory of our party's revolutionary lines and  the great victory of single-minded unity among the leader  [suryong], party, and masses. [applause]    Last year our people, under the leadership of the party,  attained successive victories in the political and military  confrontation with the enemies. With high revolutionary zeal,  they vigorously accelerated the socialist economic construction  and brilliantly concluded the final year of the Third Seven-Year  Plan. [applause]    During the Third Seven-Year Plan period, we came up against  considerable difficulty and obstacle in the economic  construction owing to the unexpected international events and  the acute situation created in the country, but we have made  great progress in all fields of socialist economic construction.  Our independent industry made significant expansion in the  overall production capacity, the standard of its technology and  equipment was enhanced much, and its structure by sectors  further reinforced, thereby its self-reliance and might was  further strengthened.    In the rural economic sector, the great nature-remaking  project of completing irrigation at a higher level was  victoriously conducted and an upturn was brought forth in  mechanization and scientization. With the further development  of agricultural science and technology in conformity with the  chuche agricultural method, we built a solid revolutionary  agricultural foundation ensuring a continuous bumper crop.    According to our party's idea of capital construction, the  magnificent and splendid Kwangbok Street, Tongil Street, the  Fatherland Liberation War Victory Monument, the Three  Revolutions Exhibition Center, the May Day Stadium, and numerous  other monumental creations were built during the Third  Seven-Year Plan period. This intensively demonstrates the might  of the inexhaustible creativity and our country's self-reliant  national economy. It clearly symbolizes the heroic spirit of  socialist Korea which victoriously advances undisturbed by the  worldwide economic recession. [applause]    Despite today's complicated situation, our people are all  enjoying rewarding, happy lives free from social and political  unrest or worries about livelihood under the popular  mass-centered socialist system of our country. The communist  virtues, in which the people help and encourage each other--one  for all and all for one--sharing joy and sorrow, prevail more  beautifully in the entire society.    Through a stern trial and struggle in recent times, we  strongly demonstrated once again that our party is a great party  of iron-will and tested guidance, that our people are a heroic  people of firm revolutionary faith and indomitable struggle  spirit, and that our-style socialism embodying the chuche idea  is an indestructible socialism taking root deep among the  popular masses. [applause]    I warmly thank all the people--including our workers,  farmers, intellectuals, and the soldiers of the People's  Army--for the shining exploits they have accomplished in the  revolution and construction last year under the party's  leadership. [applause]    The New Year of 1994 is a year of revolutionary upturn when  our country's socialist construction enters a new developmental  stage and a year of rewarding struggle when the entire party  membership, the entire country, and all the people should be  totally mobilized to effect revolutionary upsurge in all fronts.    The situation at home and abroad of our revolution is still  complicated and strained, and we are building socialism in acute  confrontation with the enemies. In conformity with today's  situation and the demand of our revolution's development, we  must thoroughly implement the independent, self-reliant, and  self-defending revolutionary line and vigorously conduct the  three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--so  that we may further strengthen the country's political,  economic, and military might.    We must solidify and develop the successes we have already  attained in socialist construction and win new greater victories  so that we may add luster to the popular mass-centered socialism  of our own style and hold further aloft the chuche socialist  banner. [applause]    We should consider the next three years to be an adjustment  period for the socialist economic construction as decided at the  21st plenary session of the sixth party Central Committee. We  should thoroughly implement a policy of top priority for  agriculture, light industry, and trade during this period.    Along with this, we should firmly give priority to  developing  the coal and electric power industries and railway  transportation, which are primary sectors in the national  economy. We should constantly develop the metal industry. By  thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary strategies  during the adjustment period for the socialist econonomic  construction, we should consolidate as firm as a rock the  self-reliant economic foundation of the country, should more  smoothly ensure the people's lives in keeping with the socialist  demand, and should secure a new position of attack to reach a  higher target of socialism. [applause]    This year, we should concentrate our strength on developing  agriculture, the light industry, and foreign trade. This year  is a significant year. It marks the 30th anniversary of the  publication of the socialist rural theses. We should effect a  new turn in developing the rural economy by vigorously  struggling to implement the historic task of the rural theses.  We should further develop all fields of agricultural  production, including the production of grains, by consolidating  the successes of irrigation and electrification in the rural  areas, realizing the mechanization and widespread use of  chemicals at a higher level, and by thoroughly carrying out the  chuche-oriented farming method in the rural areas.    Our working class should produce more tractors, automobiles,  modern agricultural farming instruments, chemical fertilizers,  and farming medicines, and send them to rural villages. With  the attitude befitting the masters responsible for the national  granary, the people working in agricultural cooperatives and all  the people working in agriculture should conduct all farming  work carefully and frugally and realize the high target of grain  production provided by the party. [applause]    We should make a great innovation in producing people's  consumer goods by vigorously accelerating the light industry  revolution. We should repair, supplement, and modernize light  industry plants. We should take a positive measure to  strengthen the production of light industry raw materials, such  as chemical fibers and plastics. By so doing, we should operate  all light industry plants at full capacity and normalize  production at a higher level.    Ranging the large-scale central light industry from small-  and medium-sized local industries and the production of 3 August  people's consumer goods, all units and domains should fully  produce various people's consumer goods. By so doing, we should  increase the types of consumer goods and actually improve their  quality.    We should positively pioneer foreign markets and thoroughly  win our reputation in developing foreign trade in keeping with  the changing circumstances. Various domains of the national  economy should thoroughly strengthen the production bases for  export goods, increase production of export goods, and improve  their quality.    All domains and all locals should further increase export by  positively finding and mobilizing the sources of export. They  should also develop the processing trade.    We should put efforts into the coal, electrict power, and  metal industries in a bid to develop agriculture and the light  industry and vigorously accelerate the overall economic  construction of the country. We should more smoothly resolve  the railway transportation issue. The fields of coal and  electric power industries should effectively use existing  production foundations and further develop the production  capacity. They thereby should decisively increase the  production of coal and electricity. We should smoothly meet the  daily-increasing demand for transportation of the national  economy by strengthening the railroad's material and  technological foundation, setting up a policy for  transportation, commanding the transportation organization, and  actively making the railways strong.    All units and domains of the national economy should  vigorously launch the campaign for the struggle for production  and conservation as an all-people movement. By so doing, they  should effectively use existing labor, facilities, and  equipment, and should fully mobilize inner reserves and increase  production.    All the economic guidance officials must carry out economic  organizational work and production management to comply with the  party's economic strategies, have the popular masses display  their revolutionary enthusiasm and positive creativity, and,  thus overfull the people's economic plan for this year.    Contributing to socialist construction with scientific  knowledge and technology is our intellectuals' honorable duty.  In hearty response to the party's policy on cultural  revolution, intellectuals must devotedly wage the struggle to  achieve new development in science, education, culture and arts,  public health, and all other fields of socialist cultural  construction.    This year we must also cope with the enemy's war provocation  maneuvers and make proper efforts to strengthen the country's  defense capability. We must firmly prepare ourselves  politically, ideologically, militarily, and materially so that  we may confidently cope with any unexpected development, and  thoroughly establish the environment in the entire society of  regarding military affairs [kunsa] as important and actively  assisting the People's Army. [applause]    To vigorously push ahead with revolution and construction  under today's circumstances, we must strongly adhere to our  party's policy on ideological revolution, further strengthen  single-minded unity in the revolutionary ranks, and highly  demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.  Single-minded unity and self-reliance are the immortal,  honorable traditions of our revolution and the banners of  victory. [applause]    We have opened the road of brilliant victory after  overcoming  stern trials with the might of single-minded unity and made  great progress in revolution and construction while overcoming  all difficulties with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.    When all the people fight vigorously by being  single-mindedly  united around the party and the leader [suryong] and highly  demonstrating the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and  arduous struggle, can we defend and maintain the socialism of  our own style and boundlessly glorify it and victoriously  complete the chuche-oriented socialist cause no matter the trial  we may face. [applause]    We must defend single-minded unity in our revolutionary  ranks, which has been consolidated like a rock under our party's  leadership, as the most precious and further consolidate and  develop it.    We must break through difficulties at hand and score new  upsurges in socialist construction by more highly displaying the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle.    ""Let us vigorously accelerate the grand socialist onward  march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous  struggle!"" This is the call of our party today and a militant  slogan that our people must uphold. [applause]    In hearty response to the party's militant call, all the  officials, party members, and workers must continue their  innovation and advance in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by  the speed of the nineties and, thus, make the New Year, 1994, a  historic year of turns in revolution and construction in our  country. [applause]    The fatherland's reunification is a foremost national task  to  our people that cannot be delayed even for a moment. We must  achieve the cause of the fatherland's reunification at the  earliest possible date, and thus, fulfill all the fellow  countrymen's unanimous earnest desire and hand the reunified  fatherland over to the posterity. [applause]    Our party and the Republic Government put forward the  10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for  reunification of the country in a bid to lay a foundation for  national reunification through the united national strength last  year and has made all efforts to realize the 10-point program.    Our 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for  reunification of the country reflects the 70 million fellow  countrymen's noble desire to firmly unite all people as one by  transcending the difference in ideology, ideas, and systems and  to achieve the reunification and prosperity of our nation who  has the long history of half a century.    We wanted the South Korean authorities to come out to the  road of reconciliation and cooperation by responding to our  10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for  reunification of the country. We also took the important measure  for exchanging special envoys of the two sides' top leaders.  However, the South Korean authorities have ignored our  magnanimous proposals and all the people's desire for  reunification. They have taken the road of depending upon  foreign forces, not the road of national independence; they have  taken the road to the North-South confrontation, not the road to  national unity.    While frequently conducting large-scale military exercises  against our Republic, in collusion with outside forces and  talking about military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] or an  international cooperation system under the pretext of our  nuclear issue, the South Korean authorities are leading  North-South relations to a dangerous phase.    The so-called South Korean civilian regime is only so in  appearance [houl ppunida], and is actually not different from  the preceding military dictatorial regime. Anticommunist and  fascist evil laws have remained as they are in South Korea. The  South Korean people's desire for independence, democracy, and  national reunification have not been realized. The South Korean  people and figures of all strata are saying that they no longer  have any further expectations of the current South Korean  regime. This is natural.    If I speak of our nuclear issue, which the United States and  its followers are babbling about, it is because of the  antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuver which the United States  has persistently sought.    It is the United States that raised the nonexistent nuclear  issue and brought the nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula  in actuality, thus threatening us. Therefore, the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through DPRK-U.S.  talks. Pressure and threat cannot work on us. If the United  States adheres to such methods, it cannot resolve the issue and  may drive the situation to a catastrophe [paguk]. The United  States should look straight at all facts and act with discretion.    Under the circumstances in which the DPRK-U.S. joint  statement was adopted, if the two sides abide by and implement  the principles which were already reached, the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula can be impartially resolved.    There is no change in the principle and line of our party  and  the Republic Government for national reunification. We will  make all efforts to achieve the national reunification by means  of a confederation based on one nation, one state, two systems,  and two governments according to the three-point principles of  independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national  unity.    The destiny of the fatherland is the destiny of the nation  and the destiny of all our compatriots at home and abroad. All  the Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas  should be united and wage a pannational struggle under the  banner of great unity of the whole nation in order to open a new  phase for national reunification this year. [applause]    Although the imperialists are raving about the end of  socialism in the international arena, indulging in bravado and  bluster, they cannot block the people's aspiration for  independence and socialism, nor can they reverse the trend of  history. If the world's progressive people strengthen unity and  solidarity under the anti-imperialist banner for independence  and actively push forward the trend of history, they will  certainly expedite mankind's bright future. [applause]    Our party and the government of the Republic will  consistently implement the external policy of independence,  peace, and friendship in conformity with the demand of the  present situation. We will make active efforts to maintain  unity with socialist and nonaligned countries on the principle  of independence. We will also develop good neighborly and  friendly relations with capitalist countries which respect our  country's sovereignty. [applause]    The government of our Republic will destroy the old  international political and economic order of domination and  subjugation, establish new international political and economic  order based on equality, justice, and fairness, and make active  efforts to develop South-South cooperation on the principle of  collective self-reliance.    Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is an  honorable and sacred struggle for the growth and prosperity of  our fatherland and for the future of mankind. Ever-victorious  are our people who struggle for the just cause under the great  party's leadership. [applause]    Let us all firmly unite around the party Central Committee  under the banner of the chuche idea and wage a vigorous struggle  to win new victory in socialist construction and to expedite the  independent and peaceful reunification of the country. [applause]     "

0,FT944-14760 ,"FT944-14760 _AN-EJUCOADDFT 941021   FT  21 OCT 94 / Arts: Delusions of dance - Clement Crisp reviews Momix      By CLEMENT CRISP   Momix is the name of a cattle-food. It is also the name given by Moses Pendleton to the group of five gymnasts he directs, who are offered to the world as dancers. The word 'choreography' is used in the programme to describe their little numbers. The words 'dance', 'illusion', 'satire' are found in their publicity. I would venture that the satire lies in their illusion that they dance. I saw Momix on Wednesday night at Sadler's Wells as a ten day season got under way. I did not see all the programme, finding it impossible to remain for the latter part of Passion, their chief offering, since by then Momix' activities had induced symptoms I associate with having eaten a spoiled oyster. So my comments relate to about two-thirds of the evening. It may be that, thereafter, blazing theatrical genius fired the event. It may also be that the members of Momix (2m; 3f) are Equerries and Ladies in Waiting to the Queen of Peru. The programme offers gymnastic exploits and a few skimpy costumes - stretch fabric - in brief scenas of unfathomable purpose. One man exercises on a table; three girls do a Page Three with balloons; someone is involved with a rope, which gives the audience a chance to giggle. Bodies assume shapes curious but far from intriguing. The accompaniment is rock blare. One number, Alan Boeding's Circle Walker is memorably revived from a previous visit. Boeding has made a handsome structure which is a metal circle whose lower half is set at right angles to its upper part and joined by curved struts. There results a sculptural and free-wheeling object inside which Terry Pexton moves and poses. It is an imaginatively fascinating concept. Pexton becomes an heroic figure, part Icarus as he stands high on the circle's edge, part Sisyphus as he pushes it, both master and prisoner of the wheel, and we see fascinating possibilities for dance and for choreographic exploration of willed and involuntary momentum. It is grown-up activity, a phrase I cannot use about the rest of the evening. The show is, I'd hazard, ideal for those in their early 'teens. There is relentless pop music, played before the performance and in the interval - and also in the Wells' cafeteria. The performers have fine physiques, and there is a topless moment to intrigue the younger lads. Passion, the main item of the evening, has music of vast banality by Peter Gabriel, and, for as long as I watched, was pointless - unless the sight of the cast bent in half and clutching their buttocks was a message about the terrors of haemorrhoids. Perhaps this was the satire we were promised by the advertisements. It certainly wasn't the dance. Momix is at Sadler's Wells until October 29.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Exchange also believes that offsite storage should not compromise the supervisory obligations of member/participant organizations because, under the proposal, the customer information necessary to fulfill those responsibilities must be easily accessible and promptly retrievable.          5     In June 1993, the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') issued a no-action letter permitting broker-dealers to maintain certain records required by Rules 17a3 and 17a4 under the Act on optical disk technology, under certain conditions.

Accordingly, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, as well as to protect investors and the public interest.    The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitate transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest. 6           6     15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988).         Specifically, by allowing off-site storage of customer account information maintained at supervisory offices, the commission believes that the proposal should provide the PHLX's members with a cost-effective means to utilize computers, facsimile machines, optical disks, and other technology to store the required customer account information off-site while ensuring that member firms will continue to have easy access to all of the customer account information necessary to discharge their supervisory responsibilities. In this regard, the proposal provides that options customer account information stored off-site must be ``readily accessible and promptly retrievable,'' 7  thereby preserving the Exchange's ability to access and investigate customer account records. Thus, the Commission believes that the proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the PHLX's interest in allowing member organizations to reduce the cost of storing customer account information and ensuring that the information continues to be available for supervisory purposes.          7         See     October 26 Letter,     supra     note 3.         In addition, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the PHLX to allow off-site storage of customer account information maintained at supervisory offices, but not of account information stored at branch offices, because branch offices are responsible for the day-to-day administration of customer accounts and require immediate access to account information. For example by continuing to require branch offices to store customer account information on-site, the proposal facilitates broker compliance with the suitability requirements applicable to options customers.        It is Therefore Ordered,     pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 8  that the proposed rule change (File No. SRPHLX9435) is approved.        8     15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982).

The Exchange also believes that offsite storage should not compromise the supervisory obligations of member/participant organizations because, under the proposal, the customer information necessary to fulfill those responsibilities must be easily accessible and promptly retrievable.          5     In June 1993, the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') issued a no-action letter permitting broker-dealers to maintain certain records required by Rules 17a3 and 17a4 under the Act on optical disk technology, under certain conditions.

Their results, described in this week's issue of the journal Nature, throw light on the way the body controls the destruction of irreparably damaged cells. The Rb protein acts during the development of the eye in the embryo. It stops cells from dividing and causes them to differentiate into their adult forms. If it is absent, the product of the p53 gene prevents the cells from proliferating by inducing programmed cell death.

Qin Guanlin, representative to Unesco, had officially notified it of the decision. US trade negotiators had pressed Beijing to back up promises to protect patents and copyrights with deeds. China promised last year to join international copyright organisations. 'The decision was a result of China's policy of deepening reform and opening to the outside world,' the agency quoted Qin as saying.

Members of the Provincial Party Committee  Standing Committee--Yin Kesheng, Cai Zhulin, Sang Jiejia, Tang  Zhengren, Doba, Wang Hanmin, and Yao Xiangcheng--attended the  meeting. Leading cadres from the provincial people's congress,  the provincial government, the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference provincial committee, the provincial  military district, the provincial court, and the provincial  procuratorate attended the meeting as nonvoting delegates.    At the meeting, everyone studied the important instructions  issued by the Central Commission of Politics and Law on paying  attention to the work of maintaining political stability and  conscientiously exchanged views with one another. Comrade Yin  Kesheng made an important speech.    According to the meeting, the current situation of our  province is good, and we have achieved economic development,  political stability, unity among nationalities, and social  progress. Behind the positive situation, however, there are  still some unstable elements. In particular, although a faction  of evildoers who stirred up trouble were punished in accordance  with the law last October, small numbers of evildoers are still  carrying out acts of sabotage. They are fabricating rumors to  confuse and poison people's minds and are using all sorts of  dirty tricks in a vain attempt to sabotage the stable and united  political situation, in which people of various nationalities  throughout the province are engaged in a united struggle which  is not easily won. Regarding these situations, leaders at all  levels, the vast numbers of party members and cadres, and the  broad masses must maintain sharp vigilance and have a clear  understanding. We must firmly and decisively deal with all acts  which disrupt stability.    The meeting stressed that we must uphold the working  principle of following the mass line and must proceed in all  cases from the interests of the people. We must have faith in  the masses, must rely on them, and must arouse their enthusiasm,  which is the basic guarantee for the success of our undertaking.  We must educate the broad masses, enhance the awareness of  maintaining political stability, and educate the public to make  contributions to maintaining stability. Regarding the masses  who were hoodwinked last year when a handful of evildoers  stirred up trouble, we must unswervingly implement the policy of  not laying blame on them, not discriminating against them, and  not investigating or affixing responsibility for the trouble on  them so as to unite the overwhelming majority of the masses.  People of various nationalities must unite and cooperate with  one another, live in harmony, and make joint efforts to maintain  and develop the stable and united political situation, thus  achieving joint development and progress for various  nationalities.    As stressed by the meeting, the key to maintaining political  stability lies in leadership. Leaders at all levels must  further enhance their understanding of the important meaning of  maintaining political stability, must try to reach a common  understanding and pace, must firmly implement all kinds of work  in a down-to-earth manner, and must make unremitting efforts to  work for the perpetual stability of Xining and of the entire  province and for the joint prosperity and progress of various  nationalities.

Taken from the Italian  word for veal, it's a gentle idiomatic put-down of men in perpetual  adolescence, hanging out on the corner, stalking girls, avoiding as much  responsibility as they can.    In typical Hollywood fashion, ""I Vitelloni"" (screening at UC Irvine tonight)  was saddled with the title ""The Young and the Passionate"" when released in  America after its 1953 European premiere. That title doesn't work -- Fellini's  movie is about youth and passion, but it's hardly heroic or arch, as that one  implies.    ""I Vitelloni"" is, perhaps, Fellini's most ironic movie. Just about everything  this expressionistic, humane and inventive (sometimes to the point of  distraction) filmmaker has created is ironic, from the unjust human comedy of  ""La Strada"" (1955) to the picaresque freakishness of ""Fellini Satyricon""  (1970). But this one is especially sardonic in its soft-edged way.    Many think it's among his two or three best films primarily because of the  strength of the ensemble acting and the personalized feel of the story. Fellini  has been accused of making impersonal movies, but that's not the case here. The  five actors who compose Fellini's vitelloni offer characterizations that seem  more like living than performing.    Fellini uses a narrator to introduce them to us. We first spy them cruising  through a town square, possibly Rimini, Fellini's hometown. The director has  said that much of the movie is autobiographical and captures those he knew in  Rimini. The narrator tells us that Fausto (played by Franco Fabrizi) is the  group's ""leader and spiritual guide""; it's a sarcastic aside, considering that  the womanizing Fausto is, at that moment, trying to pick up a young lady.    His comrades are Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi), a character usually identified  with Fellini himself; Alberto (Alberto Sordi); and Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste)  and Riccardo (Riccardo Fellini, the director's brother). ""I Vitelloni"" follows  them through pointless days and nights. At one point the narrator says, ""In the  next few months, the most important things that happened were that Riccardo  grew a mustache and Alberto grew sideburns, while Fausto shaved his mustache  off.""    When not shaving, Fausto gets his girlfriend (Eleonora Ruffo) pregnant and they  have to marry. He still chases other women, his pals often at his side, trying  to do the same. Later, Fellini gives us a drunken carnival scene -- the image  has become his most familiar trademark, a metaphor turning up in many of his  movies, most notably ""8 1/2"" (1963) -- that highlights these men in all their  abject foolishness.    The imagery is vivid and salty. But while Fellini can't resist making fun of  them, he never becomes censorious. His customary use of camera angles to locate  intimacy is obvious in this scene and throughout ""I Vitelloni."" By dwelling on  them just so, he involves us in their lives -- you agree that they're silly,  but condemnation seems far too harsh.

Yesterday, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] had the opportunity of experiencing such a  pleasure.    Macedonia kept its cool while the most irreconcilable  opponents against its international recognition, namely the  Socialists, won the elections in Greece. The Macedonians still  remained calm when the Greeks withdrew from the UN negotiations  about Macedonia because of the country's new name and flag.    When political circles in Athens threatened to close their  country's borders with Macedonia, the ruling forces in Skopje  briefly commented that this could not be serious.    When the EU member-countries, one after the other,  established diplomatic relations with Macedonia, the Greek  Minister of European Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos started  behaving like a drunken third class actor, getting on the  Western powers' nerves. On that occasion Macedonia experienced  a certain satisfaction which was hardly noticeable, nevertheless.    The confession of certain Greek diplomats who admitted that  the dispute with Skopje is a lost cause for Greece was also  accepted without any comment on the part of Macedonia.    The official recognition of Macedonia's sovereignty by the  White House was the latest confirmation of the fact that  Macedonian politicians are betting on the right card.    Since the very first day of its separation from former  Yugoslavia Macedonia has been conducting a consistent policy  aimed at winning the good will of the United States. This  applies to all Macedonian political actions starting from a  courageous minority policy, such as none of the Balkan countries  dares to promote (as a matter of fact, the results followed in  due time, and the police just managed to prevent an Albanian  separatist conspiracy) to the Macedonian government's persistent  and heroic struggle which was finally crowned by the stationing  of a U.S. ""blue helmets"" contingent in the republic.    According to some political observers, certain actions of  other Balkan countries, such as Bulgaria's refusal to allow U.S.  nuclear arms to be deployed on its territory, and last but not  least, the stubborn behavior of Greece, are positively  contributing to Macedonia's good relations with the West.    Until yesterday Washington was the last hope for Athens.  Since yesterday the U.S. is the strongest shield for the  protection of Macedonia's independence. There is even more --  by the act of establishing diplomatic relations with Macedonia  the White House assumed the role of chief actor -- temporarily  in charge of the Macedonian drama and reversed the positions.    Athens, which relied on its international contacts, on its  traditional presence in West European affairs, and on its  membership in the European international organizations, suddenly  appears to be in a situation very similar to that described as  international isolation.    Macedonia, whose government, until recently, used to  complain  about the Western countries' lack of interest and about the  inconsistency of their behavior toward Macedonia, finally  awaited the moment of sticking its tongue without any risk. As  a matter of fact Macedonia did so yesterday by proposing to  resume negotiations with Athens, with a somewhat offensive  magnanimity.     "

The Egyptian lawyer and author Hisham Mubarak has been to  Denmark to interview Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim. Hisham Mubarak is  writing a book about the Islamic fundamentalists and their  international network.    The following is an extract from the interview with Tal'at  Fu'ad Qassim.    [Mubarak] What are the Islamic Groups now concentrating  their efforts on?    [Qassim] We are taking a three-pronged approach. First, we  are aiming at a military coup. On this front things are going  very well. The state has absolutely no information about it,  and the security police are being kept busy by a few small-scale  actions which some of the Groups' younger members have carried  out in the provinces.    Secondly, the population as a whole has to be mobilized. In  order to be able to carry out an Islamic revolution, the whole  population must be mobilized. It is very important to prevent  foreign intervention or, failing that, to delay foreign  intervention for at least 18 days, in the view of our military  people. We have organized many demonstrations and one of the  purposes of these was to train the Groups' members to mobilize  people, and we are experts in this field.    Thirdly, special missions. These are of great significance,  in that they involve the murder of some of the people in  government posts. (...) This organizational unit (responsible  for special missions -- POLITIKEN editorial note) has gained  experience through carrying out a number of missions, it is now  ready, and it will play a part in the implementation of the plan  (to overthrow the regime -- POLITIKEN editorial note). This  unit is active and it will not stop the death missions as long  as circumstances make these activities necessary. It is a  misunderstanding to think that the arrests of some members of  the Groups or an absence of action over a period of time are a  sign of weakness, since this is in accordance with a plan  adopted for this organizational unit's activity.    Preparations for a Military Coup    The state knows nothing about the military organizational  unit which is responsible for preparing a military coup, nor  does it know anything about the organizational unit responsible  for special missions. If some of its members are arrested, the  only information these members have is about their own cell, and  that is no help to the security police at all. As for the other  cells, there is no connection between them at all.    [Mubarak] The former members of the military or those who  stood accused in the Jihad case (court case in connection with  the murder of al-Sadat -- POLITIKEN editorial note) were rank  and file soldiers and officers who had no power. If we assume  that what you say is correct, this does not pose a great threat.  What are your views?    [Qassim] I disagree with you. It is the young officers who  hold the real power, since soldiers do not take their orders  from the generals, and we believe in the importance of  lower-ranking officers; history has shown this. They are the  most motivated people.    Tourists Spread AIDS    [Mubarak] Why have the Islamic Groups carried out terrorist  acts against tourism?    [Qassim] There is more than one reason for the policy of  attacking tourism. Firstly, tourism is a major source of income  which is incompatible with Islam and which goes to fill the  state coffers. This means that the regime receives money which  helps to keep it in power, while we think that the regime should  be removed. So we have decided to strike this area in order to  remove this source of income to the government, so that the  regime loses its power. (...)    Secondly, tourism in its present form is an abominable thing  because it spreads prostitution and AIDS via female Jewish  tourists. It is a vile means of spreading all forms of  immorality. Tourism is also used to collect information on the  Islamic Groups for foreign intelligence services. Therefore  tourism, in our eyes, is an abominable thing which should be  changed. These are the reasons for the tourist sector being hit  in accordance with the Groups' strategy of damaging the regime.    [Mubarak] But the acts of violence which you have  committed were also intended to kill, since it was tourists who  were killed. What connection is there between the tourists and  the government?    [Qassim] Some of the tourists are insured against being  killed. That is why our slogan is tourism, not tourists. We  have done a lot of planning and preparation because we wish to  avoid killing tourists. So we took a number of measures. We  issued various declarations, warning tourists against coming to  Egypt where their lives would be in danger. We declared that  anyone coming to Egypt was risking their life, because the  tourist sector is targeted, and we sent declarations to all the  competent authorities, in which they were urged not to admit  tourists for the reasons mentioned. In the light of this, those  who come anyway deserve whatever happens to them.    Attack on Investments    [Mubarak] You have issued a statement in which it appears  that investments are shortly to become a target for the Groups'  mission. When will you carry out violent acts against  investments?    [Qassim] The time when investments will be attacked depends  on a number of factors. One of these is the Egyptian security  police's treatment of us. We will assess how the struggle  between the state and ourselves is progressing. If the state  shows increasing violence towards us, we will attack investments  in revenge and in order to prevent such violence.    [Mubarak] Can you not here give what you see as valid  reasons, as you can in the case of the tourist sector. What  reasons are there for attacking investments?    [Qassim] Our aim is to destroy all state institutions with  the least possible bloodshed. These things are very simple.  One of our military cells in the Groups has the capacity to  attack investments in Egypt, when the time is ripe.     "

State Councillor and State Council  Secretary General Luo Gan attended and spoke at the meeting.    Criminal activities such as theft and sabotage of railway,  oilfield, power, and communications equipment and facilities  have become rampant in recent years. Incomplete statistics for  1993 compiled by the Departments of Railways, Power, Posts and  Telecommunications, and Petroleum show that the number of cases  involving theft and sabotage of railway, power, communications,  and petroleum equipment totalled over 19,600; that over 3.67  million meters of electric wire, cable, power transmission line,  telecommunications line, electric pump cable, and power-driven  cable were stolen; and that over 36,000 pieces of materials from  power transmission towers, as well as 830,000 meters of oil pump  levers, were stolen, resulting in a direct economic loss of 319  million yuan. These criminal acts have seriously disrupted the  social order, have affected the state's economic construction  and national defense building, and have resulted in a great loss  in state property and people's lives.    Participants in the meeting called on local public security  organs to increase the work of investigating and cracking such  cases, to carry out indepth investigation and study to determine  major regions where crackdowns are to be carried out, and to  strive to crack a number of major cases with great impact on  society in a short time. They also called on public security  organs to enhance coordination with courts and procuratorates;  to resolutely implement the policy of swiftly and severely  cracking down on criminal activities according to law; and to  mete out severe punishments to thieves, to those who receive and  sell stolen goods, and to key members of theft rings who create  major losses to industrial and agricultural production as well  as to national defense building.    Participants in the meeting also stressed that those who  steal and sabotage military communications equipment, railway  and power facilities, and other important production equipment  should never be let off lightly in view of the serious  consequences of their acts and of the great impact they have on  society. The phenomenon of imposing a fine instead of meting  out a prison term should be resolutely rectified, and the  practice of giving verbal admonishment instead of inflicting  penalties should be strictly forbidden.    Luo Gan spoke at the meeting. He said railways, oil, power,  and communications are the state's basic industries, occupying a  decisive position in national economic construction. A high  degree of importance should be attached to the development of,  and security guarantees should be provided to, these industries  since they have a bearing on the national economy and the  people's livelihood as well as on the overall situation of  reform and opening up. He called on relevant departments to  make close coordination, to cooperate with each other, and to  make the utmost efforts to achieve success in the struggle  against the theft of state property.    Departments and units also attending today's joint  teleconference included the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry  of Power Industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,  the Ministry of Internal Trade, the State Administration for  Industry and Commerce, and the China National Petroleum  Corporation.

""The incidents that took place can be divided into two  categories. The first involves people wanting to put political  pressure on the government, while those responsible for the  second category are terrorists,"" Chawalit said at a press  conference after a 90-minute meeting with senior police officers.    Chawalit said the March 3 grenade assault on Social Action  leader Montri Phongphanit's home, the March 8 bomb attack on a  train in Songkhla's Chana district, the March 9 grenade attack  on Deputy Permanent Secretary for Interior Sawai Phramani, the  March 13 grenade attack on the Nakhon Phanom governor's  residence and the March 20 blast in downtown Hat Ya in Songkhla  province fell into the first category.    The truckload of explosive materials which was believed to  be  aimed at the Israeli Embassy last Thursday was the work of  international terrorists the interior minister said.    ""I call on the public to remain calm and analyze the  situation carefully to arrive at a rational conclusion. I have  told you before that I will take responsibility for everything  that happens,"" he said. But he claimed the attacks carried out  by disaffected political elements with the aim of destabilizing  the government were not of national significance.    ""For example, the grenade attack in Nakhon Phanom (at the  provincial governor's home) may be a mistake on the part of the  assailants,"" he said.    ""Acts of terrorism usually intensify and eventually lead to  armed struggle, which is exactly what happened in our country in  the past,"" he said.    Chawalit said his meeting with senior police officers, led  by  Police Director General Pratin Santipraphop, was to review the  political implications of the incidents and to find ways to  effectively deal with them.    He said he was satisfied with police investigations into the  incidents. But he could not set a deadline for the cases, which  he described as difficult to be solved because those involved  are not ""common criminals"".    ""Bringing the perpetrators to justice is not beyond the arm  of the law,"" the minister said.    Chawalit said he was summoned by Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai  yesterday morning for a briefing on the latest developments in  the investigation into the cases.    Police sources said the interior minister imposed a code of  silence on all senior police officers except Pol Gen Pratin.    Pratin, asked to comment on criticism that police always  failed to catch people committing terrorist acts, said: ""I  think we will fail to arrest any of them again this time.""    Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of the  National Security Council, said he briefed the prime minister on  the terrorist attacks during a two-hour meeting yesterday.    ""Thailand should not be made a target of terrorist attacks.  We denounce all acts of international terrorism that affect our  internal security,"" Khachatphai said.    Deputy Chat Thai leader Sano Tianthong said Chawalit should  show responsibility for the violence by stepping down because  the Police Department under his ministry had failed to solve  serious crimes, particularly acts of terrorism.    ""It is interesting to note that there have been many bomb  attacks since Chawalit took office as interior minister. The  interior minister is not supposed to shirk his responsibility  now,"" Sano said.    The deputy Chat Thai leader said he believed the violence  could be attributed to local disaffected political groups as  well as international terrorists.     "

We condemn their acts of vandalism and violence but  we call for their release since peace in this country is  priceless. Also, we call on the AEEM and even demand the AEEM to  stop its acts of vandalism because vandalism has never solved  any problems.    We appeal to the government for multilateral dialogue as the  AEEM no longer trusts the government. Since the association no  longer trusts in negotiations, it is forced to obtain some  guarantees and such guarantees are the other social forces.  There is a need for multilateral dialogue to put an end to  confrontation and misunderstanding due to mistrust. [end  recording]    The CNID official also condemned what he described as verbal  threats uttered by some top state officials, the excesses of the  security forces, and the behavior of private militias.  Concluding, he denied that the AEEM was manipulated by the  opposition, adding that the AEEM is manipulated by its own  problems.    For his part, the PSP [Progressive Sudanese Party]  representative called for a national debate to be attended by  all the social partners to help end the crisis. According to  Ousmane Dicko, this debate which will aim at restoring social  peace as well as security of goods and people will tackle all  the nation's major problems, namely the education crisis, fraud,  insecurity, structural adjustment, and so on.    Another issue discussed at this news conference was press  freedom. The related paper was read by Ibrahim Diakite of the  National Front. After stressing the media's role in the advent  of democracy in Mali, the official said government is stifling  press freedom. In this regard, he denounced the closing down of  Radio Kaira, the censorship in force at the radio and television  broadcasting corporation, and the lack of statutes for  independent radios. He therefore made some suggestions to  safeguard press freedom.    [Begin Diakite recording] We suggest, first, the presence of  media practitioners elected by their colleagues, representatives  of the Malian Association for the Defense of Human Rights and of  the Malian Bar Association within the national committee on  equal access to state media. Second, we suggest the extension  of the committee's responsibilities beyond the period of  electoral campaigns. The opposition wants the Higher  Communication Council to include media practitioners elected by  their colleagues. It calls for the division of the Malian Press  Agency into three different directorates: First, a directorate  of publications for ESSOR, PODIUM, and so on; a directorate of  the news agency in charge of gathering news; and a directorate  of advertisement. Finally, the opposition calls for the review  of the provisions of the law on the media and related offenses.  [end recording]     "

0,FT921-1759 ,"FT921-1759 _AN-CCWA7ABKFT 920323   FT  23 MAR 92 / Arts: A glimpse of the golden age at the Biblioteque-Musee - In Paris Ronald Crichton visits the refurbished Palais Garnier and a performance of Elektra      By RONALD CRICHTON   The pavilion forming the West wing of the old Opera, the Palais Garnier, was intended as a ceremonial entrance for Napoleon and Eugenie, who had survived an attempted assassination some years earlier outside the previous opera house in the rue Le Peletier. By the time Garnier's building was ready the Second Empire had collapsed and the former Emperor had died in exile at Chislehurst. For more than a century the pavilion has housed a fabulous collection devoted to opera and the dance, the property of the Biblioteque Nationale, consulted by writers and students many of whom, as I used to, may have felt a little overawed by the surroundings - at once tradition-haunted and fusty. There were temporary exhibitions which could be visited from the auditorium during intervals. The one mounted for Robert le diable added a good deal to the effect of that opera's revival a few years ago. Recently the Ministry of Culture, the Biblioteque Nationale, the Opera, Louis Vuitton and AROP combined (in perfect harmony, it appears - finished on time, budget not exceeded) to redesign and refurbish that part of the huge building. The result is officially called 'Biblioteque-Musee de l'Opera'. In spite of the joint title, library and museum are now separated by an isophonic partition: seekers after truth are shielded from mere visitors wandering round the portraits, drawings, caricatures, models and posters. The new entrance is inside the main building, not as before in the rue Scribe. The monumental staircase which led from the side entrance is incorporated into the museum itself for temporary exhibitions. The noble proportions and bare walls, which must disconcert those who associated Garnier's architecture with rampageous gilt-encrusted decoration, would still look austere even if the imperial eagles and initials had been sculpted on them as planned. The new vitrines and furniture are the work of Richard Peduzzi, Cherau's designer for the Paris Lulu and for the 1978 Ring at Bayreuth. (Open everyday except Sundays, 10-4.30.) The special exhibition now showing, in support of the Picasso ballet programme described last Wednesday by Clement Crisp, is The Ballets Russes at the Opera. Not all Diaghilev's scandals and successes happened here - the Chatelet and the Champs-Elysees were also much involved. There is still plenty to show, from the time of the Boris Godunov of 1908 which started the whole thing off, up to Diaghilev's death in 1929. Many of the objects have been seen at loan exhibitions elsewhere and still more are familiar from reproductions, yet their impact remains as fresh as ever - the strength of invention, the range and versatility, the constant ability to use modern art in a theatrical context, from Golovin, Bakst and Benois up to Picasso, Matisse and Chelitchev. The wealth has been mined by succeeding generations but it is hard to throw off a feeling of decline. After these golden-age glimpses the Elektra shared with Los Angeles (where Max Loppert reviewed it) and Houston, now at the Bastille, looks a rather sad affair in John Bury's rubbly, ugly-ugly and, worse, uninteresting set. One wondered why it was thought worth while to bring half way across the world a production (originally by David Pountney, staged for Paris by Clare West) now chiefly remarkable for its failure to strike more than intermittent sparks from some powerful singers. In the title-role Gabriele Schaut, one felt, was poised for a fine performance which never quite materialised. Her top notes, cutting but not strident, winged out as if they would shoot across Paris and shake the Eiffel Tower. Rapid phrases were boxy and incomprehensible. Helga Dernesch's Clytemmestra, a potentially fascinating study of a thoroughbred gone disastrously wrong, did not project strongly enough in the unfriendly spaces. The Chrysothemis of Karen Huffstodt had vivid moments. In the brief role of Aegisthus Jean Dupouy was blessedly clear, but no Aegisthus can save an Elektra Under the Danish conductor Michael Schonwand the orchestra delivered thunderous climaxes and, as usual, some expert woodwind playing, with little of the genuine Straussian warmth. Acoustical problems in this theatre are not yet solved. Nothing so simple as the orchestra drowning the voices. The two in some way hard to define don't sit down together, with results unsatisfying and tiring to the ear. In fairness I report that a packed house loved it all. June Anderson having cancelled her solo recital at the Opera-Comique thorough illness, there was just time to get to the Champs-Elysees to hear another popular American star, Chris Merritt, give a whopping programme of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. This tenor's particular strength lies in the unusual way he combines technical agility with heroic vigour. The heroic side may be gaining the upper hand. Merritt looked like Siegfried and often sounds like him: I was ready for him to launch at any moment into the Forging Songs. He opened with an 'A te, O cara' from I puritani which wouldn't have disgraced Verdi's Manrico. Too beefy by half, but beef gradually gave way to rarer meats and operas with two Rossini arias written for the formidable Naples tenor Andrea Nozzari. Thomas Muraco dealt ably with the piano accompaniments.  The Financial Times   London Page 15  "

It carries a militant voice that we have missed very much,  especially these days when we are almost suffocated by the dust  of [the Arab-Israeli] talks, whose only objective is to destroy  our cause and terminate our existence. This radio conveys to us  the daily heroic actions of our kinsfolk in Palestine, always  accompanied by songs of revolution and jihad.    It is unlike the other Arab radios filling the airwaves. It  has been distinctly successful in attracting listeners of other  radios inside and outside the occupied territories. Having won  keen and regular listeners, the radio dedicated all its  resources to reporting on and following Palestinian events  anywhere at anytime.    When I arrived in Damascus, I immediately began to look for  the radio building. Few people were familiar with the place.  Therefore, it took me some time before I managed to arrive at  the radio building. It was not a big surprise to me when I  found nothing but a small, old four-story building, the first  story of which is occupied by the radio station. This building  is surrounded by shops and other residential buildings. The  only thing that distinguishes it from other buildings is an  armed guard standing at its gate. I was not surprised because I  knew that the radio officials wanted to keep its location secret  so that it would not become an easy target for attacks or acts  of sabotage.    Since its establishment, this radio has continued its role  of  invigorating our Palestinian people and their struggle against  their enemies, both overt and covert, including those who hide  their treachery and treason under guises of political wisdom.    Al-Quds Radio has managed to worry and annoy Israel, which  was prompted jam it despite the high costs, which has amounted  to millions of dollars. For this purpose, Israel used jamming  devices at the building of the Ramallah radio, something Israel  has not done against any other Arab radio.    Abu-Shadi [Fadl Shururu], director general of the al-Quds  Radio, says: Al-Quds Radio began its experimental transmission  in 1987, and officially announced its name on 1 January 1988,  when it began to identify itself as: ""Al-Quds, the Palestinian  Arab Radio on the Road to Liberation of Land and Man."" Only 20  days after the beginning of its official transmission, the  Zionists began to jam the radio on the recommendation of  terrorist Mike Gurdus, [Israeli radio's] specialist in  monitoring Arab radios in the Middle East.    Not long after the blessed intifadah broke out, Al-Quds  Radio began broadcasting to become one of the continuous factors  of incitement for our kinsfolk to continue struggle and  steadfastness in face of the Zionist enemy.    The radio broadcasts statements issued by Palestinian  resistance factions, which call for strikes and demonstrations.  It also transmits patriotic songs and follows Palestinian  developments and broadcasts these developments as soon as the  necessary information is available. All this explain the  enemy's costly attempt to jam the radio.    In one occasion, Al-Quds Radio was forced to make 56  frequency changes to evade the Zionist jamming. The  continuation of these jamming attempts by the enemy gave the  workers of the radio lots of experience in changing frequencies  quickly -- in less than two minutes. It is noteworthy that the  radio broadcasts on three waves: the medium, short, and FM waves.    The radio's transmission begins at 0900 and lasts until  2000.  Hence, the question is raised: If the radio shoulders the  responsibility of this important media role to serve our people  and their cause, are the limited transmission hours enough to  realize this objective?    Abu-Shadi says: We wish that we could continue transmitting  24 hours a day because we need to maintain contacts with our  people, but this requires huge material capabilities that are  not available at present. In fact, some large quarters are  prepared to buy our radio on the condition they would turn it  into one of their media horns that markets their ideas and  policies.    The small size of the place is another obstacle to the  development and growth of the radio. As I said before, the  radio is in one floor of a building in which all radio  departments, including the studios, are present.    In the editorial room, which is no more than 3 by 4 square  meters, nearly eight people sit at a rectangular table to edit  news and write reports. You can see the editor of the Russian  newscast beside the editor of the Hebrew newscast, and beside  them sits the editor of the Arabic newscast. The constraints of  the place may cause some problems here or there, but of course  does not prevent the continuation of work in constant force and  enthusiasm. [passage omitted]    The radio also seeks to effect communication with non-Arab  communities. For, it airs programs targeting Jewish immigrants  in Palestine. The radio airs its programs in seven languages,  in addition to Arabic. These languages are the following:  Hebrew, Russian, French, Italian, English, Spanish, and  Romanian. As a matter of fact, the radio has not thus far  received any real feedback from target listeners on these  programs. But, the radio director is almost certain that the  radio programs are also listened to by Jews in Palestine. The  very reasons that prompt the Palestinians of the occupied  territories to listen to this radio's programs are bound to  prompt Jews to do so, the radio director argues.    Having debated with Abu-Shadi the media role being played by  Palestinian factions, I wanted to ask him about the clearly  stepped-up Islamic sentiments enshrined in the programs aired by  this radio, particularly since the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], which is  managing this radio station, has not been known as a front that  promotes Islamic sensibilities. When I asked him this question,  he was disturbed. He retorted, saying: The fact that the radio  was launched by the PFLP-GC does not mean that it belongs to the  PFLP-GC. Al-Quds Radio is the radio of the Palestinian masses  inside and outside the occupied territories. It is the radio of  those denied the chance to make their voices heard. It is not  affiliated with any Palestinian resistance faction. At any  rate, I hope that we will someday become Muslims in deed, and  not only in word, Abu-Shadi added.    Fast reporting is an equally important factor that has  contributed to the radio's wide popularity. The radio is quick  to report on news stories. By the way, the radio has listeners  in various parts of the Arab homeland, as well as Europe.  Abu-Shadi adds: Fast reporting, and accuracy in broadcasting  developments in the occupied territories have enhanced the  radio's reputation, and allowed it to increase the number of its  listeners. These factors have also given rise to myths about  the radio. When the radio first began transmission, there were  numerous guesses as to where it was transmitting from. The  radio was reported to have been transmitting from a secret place  in Jerusalem. In an opinion poll conducted in London last year,  Al-Quds Radio came ahead of both the BBC Arabic Service and  Monte Carlo Radio in terms of preference by listeners.    To obtain its news stories, the radio depends on a network  of  correspondents inside the occupied territories. Abu-Shadi  believes that it is enough for a Palestinian to be a true  patriot enjoying a high sense of responsibility toward his cause  and people to qualify as a correspondent for the Al-Quds Radio.  Zionist troops once apprehended several correspondents of the  radio in Gaza, Rafah, and Nabulus. But, these correspondents  had already trained others to do their job and accomplish news  assignments. Correspondents use fax machines to send their news  reports to the radio in Damascus. The radio also has  subscriptions with several international news agencies; and this  enables the radio to cover Arab and international developments.  Nonetheless, the radio airs news agency-datelined Palestinian  news stories only after it receives a confirmation of these  stories from its correspondents in the occupied territories.  [passage omitted]    [Fu'ad] Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, and  even before that, the Al-Quds Radio has been opposed to the  peace process. What will happen to your radio if Syria  concludes a peace treaty with Israel?    [Shururu] We at Al-Quds Radio still believe that what is  being done is capitulation, rather than peace. We mean what we  say. How can we expect the achievement of peace at a time when  our people are still displaced, and when their objectives are  yet to be achieved? If the Israelis give the Arabs back the  Golan and southern Lebanon, and deny me the right to regain my  land and national soil, there will be no peace. As long as  there is a good reason for Palestinian children to continue to  carry stones, there is no room for any talk of peace. If and  when the Syrian leadership signs a peace agreement with Israel,  providing for a recognition of Israel, something which I cannot  believe even if I were to see it with my own eyes, then we can  discuss this development. In this regard, I would like to  emphasize that Al-Quds Radio is not the only weapon in the hands  of our people. It is an instigator. Our people's struggle will  not come to a halt with any cessation in the radio's  transmission.    [Fu'ad] Then, is it possible that Al-Quds Radio will halt  its  transmission?    [Shururu, smiling] If this were to be forced on us, there is  nothing we can do to ward off such a development.    [Fu'ad] This is Al-Quds Radio, the Palestinian Arab radio  along the path of liberating land and man. It has continued to  exemplify a mature media perspective. We hope that many of our  Arab radio stations will emulate Al-Quds Radio. We acknowledge  that the example this radio has provided is not flawless, for  there is always room for improvement in the radio's performance.    We salute Al-Quds Radio and its employees.     "
0,FT933-16039 ,"FT933-16039 _AN-DGFC3AD0FT 930706   FT  06 JUL 93 / Leading Article: India's two years   INDIA'S ECONOMIC progress in the two years since the government of Mr Narasimha Rao came into office has been impressive. For this, the prime minister, his minister of finance, Dr Manmohan Singh, and the officials who are pushing reform forward deserve both credit and support. Both of these were duly received at the meeting of aid donors in Paris at the end of last week, which pledged assistance worth US Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds 4.9bn) for 1993-94. India contains nearly as many people as Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America together. The attempt to reconcile economic progress with democracy in so huge and poor a country has something heroic about it. Until recently, however, that heroism was not matched by common sense over economic policy. The trigger for change was a crisis. Two years ago India was on the brink of default. Decisive action at home, luck with the weather and strong support from abroad have brought a remarkable turnround. Foreign exchange reserves have increased from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 6 1/2 bn; annual consumer price inflation has fallen from a peak of 17 per cent to 6 per cent; the central government's fiscal deficit has been reduced from 8.4 per cent of gross domestic product in 1990-91 to the 4.7 per cent expected this year; overall economic growth, after dipping to 1.2 per cent in 1991-92, is expected to exceed 5 per cent again this year. Little wonder India is one of the IMF's models. Policymakers did not limit themselves to stabilisation. A 'big bang' reform was ruled out for political reasons. But a discussion paper released by the finance ministry at the end of last week stresses that what has happened so far represents the first two years of a five-year programme of market-oriented reform. Still to come, says the finance ministry, are further fiscal consolidation, completion of tax reform (including introduction of a VAT), further reductions in tariffs (which still peak at 85 per cent), further financial sector reform, improvements to infrastructure (notably power generation), reform of the oil sector and, not least, 'restructuring of weak and unviable enterprises'. This is good as far as it goes, but it does not yet go far enough. The government is not yet prepared to admit that both efficiency and the need for additional investment make wholesale privatisation inescapable. It has been unwilling to recognise that private employers will not hire people they are unable to fire. It has hardly begun to reform perhaps the most intractable of all problems, centre-state relations. India has far to go. But beginning a new departure is often the hardest part. Provided neither complacency nor instability set in, the chances for further reform and improved performance look excellent. The finance ministry talks of sustainable growth of 6 to 7 per cent. Six per cent is a minimum for a country like India. But 7 per cent need not be the ceiling.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, general secretary of  the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and  president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  delivered a New Year address at the joint meeting.    His New Year address reads in full:    Dear comrades, compatriots, brothers and sisters,    Today we are ringing out 1993, a brilliant year which has  been marked with a heroic struggle and great exploits, and  ringing in a new year 1994, full of confidence and optimism.    On the occasion of the new year, I extend warm  congratulations and fervent greetings to our working class,  cooperative farmers, intellectuals, officers and men of the  People's Army, and all the other people who have been working  hard with devotion for the socialist cause of chuche, with  unfailing loyalty to the party and the revolution.    My warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings also go  to  our brothers in the South, our fellow Koreans in Japan, and all  the other Koreans abroad who have been striving for the peaceful  reunification of the country.    I also extend my new year greetings to the progressive  people  and our friends on the five continents who value justice and  peace and are advancing towards a new world of independence.    1993 was a historic year which powerfully demonstrated the  validity of our party's revolutionary line of independence and  the might of chuche Korea.    Last year the imperialists and reactionaries worked more  malignantly than ever to isolate and stifle our Republic and  crush our cause of socialism. As a result, the situation in our  country became extremely tense. When the country and the  revolution were faced with a stern trial, our party took  resolute self-defensive measures by declaring the state of  semi-war for the whole country, all the people and the entire  Army in order to cope with the prevailing situation. It called  on all the people to meet the enemy's challenge and bring about  a great upsurge in socialist construction in the same  revolutionary spirit and militant stamina as they had displayed  during the years of the grim fatherland liberation war.    The officers and men of our heroic People's Army and all the  people, in hearty response to the party's militant call, stood  up as one man in the struggle to defend the country's  sovereignty and revolutionary achievements with an unshakable  confidence in victory and in soaring spirits, foiled the enemy's  challenge and aggressive scheme and honourably safeguarded the  dignity and security of their socialist motherland. Thus they  fully demonstrated the unbreakable spirit of chuche Korea. This  means the victory of our party's revolutionary line, a great  victory of the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and  the masses.    Last year, while achieving one victory after another under  the party's leadership in the political and military  confrontation with the enemy, our people brilliantly adorned the  last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan by accelerating the  construction of the socialist economy with great revolutionary  enthusiasm. During the Third Seven-Year Plan we made long  strides in all fields of socialist economic construction in  spite of the enormous difficulties and obstacles caused in  economic construction by unexpected international events and the  tension in our country.    The production capacity of our chuche-orientated industry  has  been considerably expanded as a whole, the level of its  technical equipment greatly raised and the structure of its  branches has been improved still more, thus further increasing  its independence and capabilities. In agriculture grand  nature-harnessing projects to complete irrigation on a high  level have been carried out victoriously, a great advance made  in its mechanization and in the application of chemicals, and  agricultural science and technology have developed still further  in keeping with the requirements of the chuche farming method,  with the result that a solid foundation of agricultural  production has been laid to ensure a bumper crop every year.  Numerous monumental creations such as magnificent and splendid  Kwangbok and Tongil Streets, the monument to the victorious  fatherland liberation war, the three-revolution exhibition and  the May Day Stadium were built in Pyongyang during the Third  Seven-Year Plan in accordance with our party's plan for the  construction of the capital. They graphically illustrate the  unfathomable creative force of our working people and the might  of our independent national economy and clearly symbolize the  heroic mettle of socialist Korea which is advancing triumphantly  in spite of any upheavals in the world situation.    Under our people-centred socialist system our people enjoy a  worthy and happy life on an equal basis free from any social and  political unrest and without any worries about their life even  in the present complex situation, and a beautiful communist  morality is flowering further throughout our society, the people  sharing weal and woe and helping and leading each other forward,  on the principle of one for all and all for one.    Through the recent harsh trials and struggle we have  convincingly proved once again that our party is a great party  possessing an iron will and capable of seasoned leadership, that  our people are a heroic people having unshakable revolutionary  confidence and unbreakable fighting spirit, and that the  socialism of our own style embodying the chuche idea is an  unconquerable socialism which has struck its roots deep among  the popular masses.    I express my warm gratitude to our workers, farmers,  intellectuals, the soldiers of the People's Army and all the  rest of our people who, under the party's leadership, performed  brilliant exploits last year in the revolution and construction.    The new year 1994 is a year of a revolutionary advance when  the building of socialism in our country will enter a new stage  of development; it is a year of a worthy struggle for the entire  party, the whole country and all the people to make an all-out  effort and effect a great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts.    The internal and external situation of our revolution is  still complex and tense, and we are building socialism in a  sharp confrontation with the enemy.    To meet the requirements of the present situation and the  development of our revolution we must carry out the  revolutionary line of independence, self-sufficiency and  self-reliant defence and expedite the three revolutions --  ideological, technical and cultural -- to further increase the  political, economic and military power of the country. We must  consolidate and exploit the successes we have already achieved  in the socialist construction and must score a fresh, greater  success. In this way we will add glory to the socialism of our  country centred on the popular masses and fly the socialist  banner of chuche higher.    Setting the next three years as a period for adjustment in  the sector of socialist economic construction as decided at the  twenty-first plenary meeting of the Sixth Party Central  Committee, we must in this period implement to the letter the  agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first  policy. Along with this, we must give definite precedence to  the coal industry, power industry and rail transport, which must  advance ahead of the other sectors of the national economy, and  must continue to develop the metal industry.    By carrying out the revolutionary economic strategy of our  party during the period of adjustment for socialist economic  construction we will consolidate the foundations of the nation's  independent economy rock-solid, further improve the people's  standard of living to meet the socialist requirements and secure  a new launching point for scaling a higher eminence of socialism.    This year we must concentrate our effort on the development  of agriculture, light industry and foreign trade.    This is a meaningful year which will mark the 30th  anniversary of the publishing of the theses on the socialist  rural question in our country. By striving to carry out the  historic tasks set in the theses, we must make a new advance in  the development of the rural economy. We must consolidate the  successes achieved in the irrigation and electrification of the  rural areas, raise the level of mechanization and application of  chemicals, implement the chuche farming method thoroughly and  thus boost grain and all other agricultural production. Our  working class must increase the production of tractors, lorries  and other modern farm machines, fertilizers, agricultural  chemicals and a variety of other farming materials, and send  them to the rural communities. All the cooperative farmers and  agricultural working people must work in an assiduous and  methodical manner with an attitude befitting masters who are  responsible for the nation's granaries so as to attain without  fail the high goal of grain production set by the party for this  year.    We must step up the revolution in light industry and effect  a  great upsurge in the production of consumer goods. We must  adopt positive measures to improve and reinforce the light  industry factories, modernize them, and increase the production  of chemical fibres, synthetic resin and other materials for  light industry. In this way, we will operate all the light  industry factories at full capacity and maintain a high and  steady rate of production. All the sectors and units ranging  from those in the large-scale central light industry to those in  the medium and small-scale local industry and those engaged in  the production of ""August 3 consumer goods"" must produce various  kinds of consumer goods in large quantities, increase their  variety and improve their qualities radically.    In order to adapt foreign trade to the changed circumstances  and develop it, we must cultivate new foreign markets in every  possible way and build up an unquestionable reputation. We must  strengthen the bases for the production of export goods in many  sectors of the national economy, increase their production and  improve their qualities. All the sectors and regions must  further boost export by exploring and using the resources for  export and also develop processing trade.    In order to develop agriculture and light industry and  accelerate economic construction throughout the country, we must  put efforts into the coal, electric power and metal industries  and find a better solution to the problem of rail transport.  The coal and electric power industries must make effective use  of the existing production bases and create more production  capacity in order to increase coal and power production greatly.  We must strengthen the material and technical foundations of  the railways, organize and direct transportation meticulously,  lay heavy-duty rails extensively and satisfy the ever-increasing  demands of the national economy for transport.    All the economic sectors and units must launch a vigorous  campaign for increased production and economy as a mass movement  and make effective use of the existing labour, equipment and  materials. They must tap potential reserves to the full to  increase production to the maximum.    All the economic officials must organize economic work and  direct production efficiently in accordance with the party's  economic strategy. They must give full rein to the people's  revolutionary enthusiasm and creative activity and encourage  them to overfulfill this year's national economic plan.    Our intellectuals have an honourable duty to contribute  their  scientific knowledge and skills to socialist construction.  Adhering to our party's policy of cultural revolution, they  must strive devotedly to make new advances in science,  education, literature and art, public health and all other  fields of developing socialist culture.    This year, too, we must naturally put efforts into  strengthening the country's defence power to counter the enemy's  moves to provoke war. We must be fully prepared politically and  ideologically, militarily and materially, to deal with any  contingency on our initiative; we must establish a social  climate of regarding military affairs as important and assisting  the People's Army whole-heartedly.    In order to push ahead with the revolution and construction  in the present situation, we must hold fast to our party's  policy of the ideological revolution, further strengthen the  single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks and fully  display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.    Single-hearted unity and self-reliance are imperishable,  glorious traditions of our revolution as well as the banner of  victory. With the strength of single-hearted unity we have  broken through harsh trials and opened up a brilliant road of  victory; with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance we have  overcome all difficulties and brought about great changes in the  revolution and construction. When all the people are united  with a single heart behind the party and the leader and fight  courageously, displaying a high revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude, we can defend and develop the  socialism of our own style for ever in whatever trials and  accomplish the socialist cause of chuche victoriously.    We must defend like the apple of our eye the single-hearted  unity of our revolutionary ranks that has been cemented  rock-solid under the leadership of our party and consolidate and  develop it further.    We must display higher the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude, break through difficulties in our  way and effect a fresh upsurge in the building of socialism.  ""Let us accelerate vigorously the general march of socialism in  the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude"" this is  the call of our party and the militant slogan which our people  must uphold today. All the officials, party members and other  working people must, in hearty response to the party's militant  call, make continued innovations and uninterrupted advance in  the spirit of Chollima spurred by the ""speed of the '90s"" and  make the new year 1994 a year of historic advance in the  revolution and construction in our country.    To reunify the country is the supreme task of our nation  which must not be delayed. We must accomplish the cause of  national reunification as soon as possible, so as to meet the  unanimous, ardent desire of the entire nation and hand down the  reunified country to our posterity.    With a view to paving the way to national reunification by  the united effort of the nation, our party and the government of  our Republic put forward ""10-point programme of the great unity  of the whole nation for the reunification of the country"" last  year and made all our efforts to put it into effect. This  10-point programme embodies the noble desire of our 70 million  compatriots to achieve a solid unity of the whole nation  transcending the difference in ideology, ideal and system and  realise reunification and prosperity of our nation with a long  history of five thousand years. We hoped the South Korean  authorities to take the road of reconciliation and cooperation  in response to our 10-point programme of great national unity,  we also made an important proposal for an exchange of top-level  special envoys between the two sides.    But the South Korean authorities have taken the path of  dependence on foreign forces, not national independence, and of  confrontation between North and South, not national unity, by  ignoring our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the entire  nation for reunification. They have staged large-scale military  exercises against our Republic frequently in collusion with  foreign forces and have been jeopardizing North-South relations  by clamouring for ""military counteraction"" and an ""international  cooperation system"" on the pretext of our ""nuclear problem.""    The so-called ""civilian"" regime in South Korea is only a  disguise; in fact it does not differ from the successive  military dictatorial regimes. The evil anti-communist fascist  laws still remain intact in South Korea, and the desire of the  South Korean people for independence, democracy and national  reunification is not fulfilled. It is natural that the South  Korean people and public figures say that there is no need to  watch the present South Korean regime any longer and that they  have nothing to expect from it.    As for our ""nuclear problem"" about which the United States  and her lackeys are making a fuss, it is the product of the  obstinate maneuvers of the United States against socialism and  our Republic. It is the United States that has created the  fictitious ""doubt about nuclear development by the North"", and  it is the United States that has actually shipped nuclear  weapons into the Korean peninsula and have been threatening us.  Therefore, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula must on  any account be settled through Korea-U.S. talks.    Pressure or threat will have no effect on us; such an  attempt  may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to the  problem. The United States must see all the fact squarely and  behave with prudence. Since a joint statement has been adopted  by Korea and the United States, the nuclear problem on the  Korean peninsula can be settled fairly if both sides keep and  implement the principles that have been agreed upon.    The principles and the line of our party and the government  of our Republic on national reunification remain unchanged. In  future, too, we will make every effort to reunify the country in  the form of confederation which is based on one nation, one  state, two systems and two governments, on the three principles  of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity.    The destiny of the motherland is immediately the destiny of  the nation, as well as the destiny of all our compatriots at  home and abroad. All the Korean people in the North, in the  South and abroad must launch a nationwide struggle, rallied as  one under the banner of great unity of the whole nation, and  open a new phase for national reunification this year.    The imperialists are now blustering on the international  arena by vociferating about the ""end"" of socialism, but they  cannot arrest the people's aspiration to independence,  sovereignty and socialism nor can they turn back the trend of  history. If the world progressive people push forward  historical progress by strengthening unity and solidarity under  the banner of independence against imperialism, they will be  able to shape a bright future of mankind at an earliest date  without fail.    Our party and the government of our Republic will  consistently implement the foreign policy of independence, peace  and friendship in keeping with the requirements of the present  situation. On the principle of independence we will make  positive efforts to unite with socialist countries and  non-aligned countries and develop good neighbourly relations  also with capitalist countries which respect the sovereignty of  our country. The government of our Republic will work hard to  abolish the old international political and economic orders of  domination and subordination, establish new ones on the basis of  equality, justice and fairness and develop South-South  cooperation on the principle of collective self-reliance.    Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is a noble  and  honourable struggle for the prosperity of our country and for  the future of mankind. Our people who are fighting for the just  cause under the leadership of the great party will always emerge  victorious.    Let all of us fight on vigorously to achieve a new success  in  socialist construction and hasten the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country, united rock-solid behind the party  Central Committee under the unfurled banner of the chuche idea.

Esteemed brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  Presidential Council chairman and commander in chief of the  Armed Forces: Greetings of the revolution and unity. While we  do not want to remind you of the stands, sacrifices, and heroic  deeds, that the sons of the Abyan Governorate have registered at  various stages and of their national militant role in achieving  unity and democracy, we would like to stress that the situation  in Abyan Governorate has become grave as a result of the  barbaric provocations and killings to which the governorate's  honorable and innocent sons are being exposed. We urge you to  face up to your responsibilities and your historic mission,  which you pledged to God to carry out for your people and your  homeland.    While we take pride in the fact that Abyan has been destined  to be the cradle of the revolution and the revolutionaries, we  are displeased by the negligence displayed toward the  governorate and its achievements. In addition to losing its  best and noblest men, as well as being deprived of most of its  rights and needs, Abyan Governorate is being exposed to killings  and torture. (?Most parts) of the governorate are still to this  moment besieged by the most lethal machines of destruction and  death, which were brought by the advocates of division to settle  purely divisionist scores.    Brother Presidential Council chairman, brother members:  While we are addressing you, our hearts are bleeding because of  what is happening to our sons, daughters, mothers, brothers, and  sisters. While we reiterate our readiness to continue to offer  more sacrifices for the sake of unity, we do not want our  governorate, Abyan, to be the hotbed of the conflict, which  would not serve the homeland or the people's interest.  Therefore, we urge the withdrawal of all the military units  from the governorate, as well as the implementation of the  contents of the accord document, as the only solution to the  crisis.    While we urge you to abide by this, we call on the parties  in  the coalition; all the political forces, represented by the  Dialogue Committee; all the political organizations; and the  vocational and creative popular organizations to close ranks in  the face of threats to our unity and the implementation of the  Amman accord.    Brother Presidential Council chairman, brother members: The  state of loss being experienced by the sons of the Abyan  Governorate, throughout the republic, and abroad as a result of  statements transmitted by print and electronic media organs,  prompts us to urge, through this message, a halt to this media  propaganda that only harms our governorate. At the same time,  we call for the facts to be clarified to our people through the  military committee and the Political Forces Dialogue Committee  so that we, as well as our people's masses, can unveil those  behind the bloody conflict from which the sons of Abyan -- who  are faithful to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity --  are suffering. May God grant you success in maintaining the  interest of the homeland and people. Peace and God's mercy and  blesses be upon you.    [Signed] The sons of Abyan Governorate     "

Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, one of the leaders behind the  fundamentalist groups in Denmark, instigates acts of terrorism  -- including those against Danish firms and Danish tourists in  Egypt -- from his home in the Copenhagen area.    He is under sentence of death for his part in the  assassination of Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat in 1981. The  Egyptian state has requested his extradition from Denmark, but  Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim has been granted political asylum in Denmark  and, therefore, cannot be handed over to Egypt.    ""Kill the infidels and join the fight for an Islamic state  in  Egypt,"" Islamic fundamentalists urge in mosques throughout  Denmark.    For Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim and the other fundamentalists the  purpose of the terrorism is to create economic chaos and social  unrest in Egypt, so as to overturn President Mubarak's moderate  government.

But the Danish asylum authorities have no opportunity to  assess whether or not those seeking asylum are members of  international terrorist organizations. The asylum authorities  may not check the identity of those seeking asylum with Interpol  or with the police in their country of origin.    In Egypt, Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim is considered one of the  leaders of the extremist Islamic groups which, with their bases  outside the country, attempt to overthrow the Egyptian  Government and set up an Islamic state. He himself does not  hide his links with Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, one of the most  violent and fundamentalist Islamic groups in Egypt.    The left-wing Egyptian newspaper AL-AHALI recently published  an interview with Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, in which he made threats  against foreign tourists and investments in Egypt, including  Danish firms such as A.P. Moeller, F.L. Smidth, and Aarhus  Flydedok, which operate in Egypt, and the 2,000 or so Danish  tourists who holiday there each year.    ""Tourism is a non-Islamic source of income which helps keep  the present government in power, and foreigners have been warned  to stay away from Egypt,"" Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim told the Egyptian  paper.    ""The radical Muslim leaders such as Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim  living in various places in Europe and the United States pose a  very real threat to their countries. It is easy for them to  send orders for actions, money, or tapes with religious  propaganda to members of the fanatical groups in Egypt, for  example,"" POLITIKEN was told by Hesham Mubarak, a lawyer  currently writing a book on radical Islamic groups and their  international networks.    Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim is a well-known figure in fundamentalist  circles. In 1981 he was arrested as a leader of the banned  fanatical group Jihad (Holy War), which later that year was tied  to the assassination of President Anwar al-Sadat. In 1989 he  escaped while being moved with other prisoners. Traveling  through the Sudan and Peshawar in Pakistan, he reached  Afghanistan where, like Sheik 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, thought to  be the brains behind the World Trade Center bombing, he became  one of the leaders of the Muslim fundamentalist volunteers  aiding the Afghan Mojahidin in fighting the occupying Soviet  power.    The Egyptian authorities have requested that Denmark hand  over Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, but he need not fear ending his days  on Egypt's gallows.    ""People who have obtained asylum in Denmark are not returned  to their own country if there is a death sentence awaiting  them,"" Justice Minister Erling Olsen said.     "

Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister, said the law was intended to help larger Greek companies become more competitive in European markets. Greece has had little success in attracting investment either in industry or tourism over the last decade, when total foreign investment amounted to less than Dollars 3bn. The announcement had no impact on financial markets where one-month interest rates remained at around 60 per cent.

While so far authorities have  assumed that the right-wing extremist scene is largely torn by  strife, now constitutional protectors admit that they have  underestimated the interlacement of the groups.    The slogan of ""Marching separately, striking together,""  which  was issued by the late neo-Nazi leader Michael Kuehnen, is  increasingly being followed. Controlled by the supra-regional  cadre organization ""New Front Association of Like-Minded  People,"" individual groups at home and abroad are coordinating  their activities through magazines, information telephones, and  mailbox systems.    The militant nature of the scene is also alarming: By the  end of 1993 the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations had  reported 1,814 acts of violence with right-wing extremist  motives. Eight people were killed; in 1992 there were 17 deaths.    The Right-Wing Extremist Scene in Germany    Parties:    The Republikaner (REP): Founded in Munich in 1983.  [Chairman Franz] Schoenhuber tries to draw a line between the  party and militant neo-Nazis. Many ex-Republikaner have good  contacts with the neo-Nazi scene. About 25,000 members.    German League for People and Homeland (DL): Collection point  for former members of the Republikaner and the NPD [National  Democratic Party]. Ex-Republikaner [and DL Chairman Harald]  Neubauer has a seat in the European Parliament and is  establishing Europe-wide contacts. The DL has 1,000 members.    National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD): In terms of  personnel it is closely linked to the neo-Nazi scene. It took  in members of the German Alternative, cooperates with the Viking  Youth, and has contacts with Worch (National List, New Front of  Like-Minded People). About 5,000 members. Its chairman is  Guenter Deckert.    German People's Union (DVU): With 26,000 members it is one  of the largest right-wing extremist organizations. Publisher  [Gerhard] Frey (DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG) cooperates with the  Russian fascist Zhirinovskiy. It has contacts with the DL.    Liberal German Workers Party (FAP): The only openly national  socialist party. Has taken in many activists of the National  Offensive, the German Alternative, and the Nationalist Front.  Attracts attention by marches and militant actions. About 220  members. Its chairman is Friedhelm Busse.    Umbrella Organization:    New Front of Like-Minded People (GdNF): The GdNF considers  itself as the cadre organization of the right-wing movement in  Germany. Its goal is the new establishment of the NSDAP  [National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazi party]. The  GdNF coordinates nationwide actions and has contact with foreign  right-wing extremists. All leading German neo-Nazis belong to  it. The head of the GdNF is Christian Worch.    Banned Organizations: German Alternative (DA): The  strongest militant neo-Nazi group in the new laender: 350  members. Active in particular in Saxony and Brandenburg.  Banned on 10 December 1992. Many of its members have joined the  NPD. Its chairman was Frank Huebner.    Nationalist Front (NF): A militant organization headed by  ex-NPD member [Meinolf] Schoenborn, it had weapons and  ammunition. It was banned on 27 November 1992. A large number  of its 130 activists gathered in the Central German Youth  Promotion Project.    National Offensive (NO): This is a collection point for  disillusioned FAP members in Bavaria, Saxony, and Brandenburg.  It intended to form ""autonomous structures."" It was banned on  22 December 1992; it had 150 members at the last count. Its  chairman was Michael Swierczek.    Organizations:    National List (NL): Founded by Kuehnen followers in Hamburg  in 1989. The NL considers itself as a ""spearhead"" and often  appears as the organizer of rightist meetings. The NL has about  30 members, and its leader is Christian Worch.    German Hesse (DH): It is a small but striking group. The  leaders belong to the inner circle of the German neo-Nazi scene.  It cultivates contacts with the Viking Youth, the FAP, and the  banned DA. It has about 60 members. Heinz Reisz is the group's  leader.    Viking Youth (WJ): The oldest right-wing extremist  organization in Germany, it was founded in 1952. In tent camps  young people get paramilitary training. It has contacts with  the NPD and has about 400 members. Its leader is Wolfgang  Nahrath.    Central German Youth Promotion Project (FMJ): This is  considered to be the successor organization of the banned DA and  NF. It is primarily active in Brandenburg. It publishes the  agitating brochure ANGRIFF [Attack], and has 100 members. The  founder of the FMJ is Andreas Pohl.    Votan's People (WV): Its leader, Arnulf Priem, was the NPD's  landtag candidate in 1974. The military sports group WV  developed in 1987 as a sidekick of the Germanic-racist ""Asgard  League."" It has about 40 members.    Right-Wing Extremist International    United States: The NSDAP/AO [National Socialist Workers'  Party/Foreign Organization] is the most important supplier of  material to the German neo-Nazis.

The union is to fight the challenge which, if successful, would almost certainly trigger similar actions throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, said the boycott was not directly against testing but against the excessive workload imposed on teachers in implementing the testing arrangements. However, legal advice obtained by teaching unions not involved in boycotts has indicated that such action would be illegal. The application is likely to be heard at the High Court today, when a date could be fixed for a full hearing early next week.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0," FR940511-1-00020   FR940511-1-00003        In developing the FFD Rule, the scope of random drug testing was one issue that received considerable attention. In the     Federal Register     notice for the proposed rule published on September 22, 1988 (53 FR 36795), the Commission solicited comments on the appropriateness of the worker categories identified for testing. At 53 FR 36817, the Commission indicated that it was proposing that the rule apply to all persons who have been granted unescorted access to protected areas because (1) current programs are implemented in accordance with the Commission's Policy Statement on Fitness-for-Duty of Nuclear Power Plant Personnel published on August 4, 1986 (51 FR 27921), which applies to all persons within protected areas at nuclear power plants; (2) these persons could introduce and sell/distribute drugs in the workplace; and (3) any person under the influence of these substances could cause a safety hazard, if not to the general public, to the user and to fellow workers.     Many of the public comments on the proposed rule addressed the scope of random testing. Most comments supported random testing for all persons granted unescorted access to protected areas. However, a considerable number of comments objected to random testing provisions of the rule. A number of the comments asserted that random testing was unnecessary and that many of the individuals granted unescorted access to protected areas have no potential for precipitating or escalating a safety-related incident. Some comments recommended that only those workers who may potentially affect the health and safety of the public be covered. For the final rule, the NRC chose not to reduce the scope of persons subject to random testing.         Currently, the FFD Rule requires licensees authorized to operate or construct a nuclear power reactor to implement an FFD program that applies to ``all persons granted unescorted access to protected areas, and to licensee, vendor, or contractor personnel required to physically report to a licensee's Technical Support Center (TSC) or Emergency Operations Facility (EOF) in accordance with the licensee's emergency plans and procedures.'' Licensees authorized to possess, use, or transport formula quantities of nuclear material were recently required to initiate FFD programs and are not included in this analysis. Persons who come under the FFD program are subject to the drug testing provisions, which include random drug tests.           Discussion           Random drug testing involves two distinct functions: (1) Random selection of persons to be tested, and (2) collection and analysis of test specimens. The random selection process is used to ensure that all persons subject to drug testing will have an equal probability of selection for testing at any time. Random drug testing is also a very strong deterrent to substance abuse.       In developing the FFD Rule, the NRC decided to specify random drug testing because of a concern about the threat that substance-impaired workers posed to the public health and safety. Based upon comments received during rulemaking, the Commission concluded that all workers with unescorted access to protected areas of operating nuclear power plants should be included within the scope of the rule. However, some workers have argued that they do not perform safety-related functions and have now questioned whether random testing is an undue encroachment on individual expectations of privacy. See     International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245     v.     NRC    , 966 F. 2d 521 (9th Cir. 1992). Other viewpoints contend that expectations of privacy are diminished when workers apply for and accept jobs in the nuclear industry because job applicants willingly agree to significant privacy encroachments including preemployment urinalysis tests, detailed background investigations, security and fingerprint checks with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, credit checks, and psychological assessments. Accordingly, the Commission is now reassessing the scope of random urinalysis testing as applied to workers without safety-related duties to ensure a proper balance between safeguarding individual rights and the Commission's responsibility to protect public health and safety.       At nuclear power reactors, the safety risks from someone using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol arise from the potential for that person to inadvertently or deliberately take actions that could affect plant safety. The safety risks from inadvertent acts primarily involve impairment caused by substance abuse and the effect of that impairment on the person's ability to perform safety-related functions. Although the Commission has no information that would indicate that a person is more susceptible to coercion or blackmail due to drug abuse than from any other activity, there is a perception that the safety risks from deliberate acts come from the susceptibility of a substance abuser to be coerced or influenced into deliberately damaging a nuclear power plant, whether or not that person has safety-related duties. For example, the person could lose their inhibitions while under the influence or could be blackmailed into some act against the plant by someone aware of that person's substance abuse.         Objective data establishes a relationship between substance abuse, impairment, and inadvertent acts [NUREG/CR5227, ``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: A Review of Technical Issues''], but the staff's review of the relevant literature suggests that insufficient scientific data exist to directly link substance abuse to the performance of deliberate (or malicious) acts. However, it has been clearly shown that, as human error rates increase, the risks to plant safety will increase significantly. [See NUREG/CR1879, ``Sensitivity of Risk Parameters to Human Errors in Reactor Safety Studies for a PWR.''] It has also been shown that substance abuse can sufficiently impair a worker's motor skills and judgment that accidents attributable to neglect and human error become significantly more probable. [See NUREG/CR5227 and Supplement 1 to NUREG/CR5227.]       Information reported to the Commission indicates that arrests for sale and distribution of illegal substances inside nuclear power plant protected areas have decreased markedly since January 1990 when the FFD Rule was implemented. Prior to the FFD Rule, a number of cases involving the sale and distribution of illegal substances at nuclear power plants were reported, as described in the staff's report cited previously. The persons arrested for on-site sale and distribution of drugs included both safety-related and non-safety-related workers. The job categories included clerks, custodial workers, craftpersons, and engineers. Since implementation of the FFD Rule, however, only one case of this type has been reported to the Commission by a nuclear power plant licensee. Two of the more significant deterrents added by the FFD Rule were: (1) The requirement for random drug testing, and (2) the five-year minimum revocation of unescorted access for persons determined to have been involved in the sale, use, or possession of illegal drugs within a protected area.

I think  that the signing of the agreement last night should mark the  beginning of a process to (?eliminate) the conflict and to  (?regulate) an overall peace in the new, territorially  reorganized part of our homeland. In other words, this is an  indispensable prerequisiste for creating specific conditions:  first, to facilitate the return of all refugees and displaced  persons. This we see as being the most important issue. In  other words, everyone to return to his or her home. This is our  main goal. We know it will be difficult to attain it but we are  working on it.    Second, to begin the process of reconstruction, development,  and consolidation in our country both by relying on our own  resources and with the help from the international community --  this was the topic of discussion with Mr. Preston, the president  of the World Bank, in particular, and with Vice President Gore  and Mr. Christopher on several occasions.    I must say -- and we stressed this point last night during  the signing ceremony -- that this agreement would not have been  possible without the direct involvement on the part of the  United States and of top U.S. officials.    We have been trying for two years to give the U.S. public a  true picture of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to spur the U.S. public and  leadership. The seeds we have been sowing for two years are now  sprouting. It seems to us that Washington, the capital of the  democratic United States, is the right place for both the talks  and the signing of this preliminary agreement and the final  agreement which, we hope, will be signed by Presidents  Izetbegovic and Tudjman on 15 March. That is the date we  arranged. We hope that all work will be completed by then.    However, this diplomatic activity was made possible by the  heroic efforts of our soldiers who liberated parts of the  territory. This was a basis for the diplomatic and political  activity. We have proved that we were not only a political but  also a military factor without which diplomatic activity could  never be sufficiently successful.    A great deal of work still needs to be done. Above all we  must maintain this level of involvement and interest on the part  of the United States, the allies, Russia, and UN member  countries to achieve peace. For this reason we will be going to  Moscow to meet Minister Kozyrev and other officials. Russia is  without a doubt an important international factor and we will  try to examine possibilities of an agreement with the Serb side.    I expect a lot of work on the preparation and the drawing up  of the federation's constitution and the confederal agreement  with Croatia. This work will be accomplished at the U.S.  Embassy in Vienna. A team of experts has already been sent  there. Once the text of the constitution and the confederal  agreement between the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  Republic of Croatia has been coordinated, Presidents Izetbegovic  and Tudjman are expected to sign these agreements in Washington.  Very little time remains and a great deal of work needs to be  done.    To conclude, I still have another meeting today in the State  Department in connection with further activities and talks.     "

Based on information  from commandos who returned from the operation, the communique  confirms that the operation against the enemy forces targeted 15  Zionist paratroopers and infantrymen from the Engineering Corps.    The communique says: When the enemy patrol arrived at the  controlled area, our comrades detonated two explosive devices  that resulted in the wounding of all of the patrol's personnel.  Afterwards, our comrades ambushed the enemy patrol and showered  them with bullets, grenades, and rockets. They took full  control of the situation in which the enemy soldiers could not  fire a single bullet. Afterwards, fatal bullets were fired at  the enemy soldiers who ran away, trampling over their comrades'  heads.    More than 30 minutes later, the Zionist enemy sent out  military rescue teams to the scene of the battle in order to  remove the bodies of their soldiers. The enemy also sent out  its tanks and infantry rescue teams to surround and chase our  comrades. However, a number of antitank and antipersonnel mines  blew up in the faces of the enemy forces, which further  increased the enemy's losses.    The enemy admitted that two noncommissioned officers [NCO's]  were killed and that three of its soldiers were wounded. As it  always does, the enemy tries to hide the number of its losses  for well-known political and moral reasons. Then it attributes  the killing of their soldiers to road accidents and other  reasons.    The communique continues to say: Hours after the  al-'Ayshiyah operation, the enemy radio announced that a truck  turned over, killing two soldiers and injuring three others. It  later announced that three of its soldiers were injured when a  missile exploded by mistake in the same area as the operation.  Hours before that, it was announced that an NCO died of his  wounds.    We, in the PFLP-GC, stress that the enemy's losses exceed 15  soldiers and tanks--which like to kill women and children, to  perpetrate massacres against our defenseless civilians inside  Palestine, and to barbarically shell southern Lebanon and the  camps inside it.    Through the operations carried out in the past few days, it  has been proven that the occupation army is unable to face the  mujahidin on the battlefield and that it quickly collapses amid  the crying and screaming of its soldiers.    On this brave operation carried out by our heroic comrades  in  broad daylight, and in view of the sacrifices of our people  inside occupied territories and the strikes by the national and  Islamic resistances, we, in the PFLP-GC, reaffirm that the  option of confrontation and jihad for the sake of liberation and  of ousting the Zionist invaders is our one only option. We also  reaffirm that the treasonous and capitulatory agreements in Oslo  and Cairo will vanish. Moreover, this will also be the fate of  the one who signed these agreements as this is the fate of all  the treasonous ones in the history of the struggling nations.  The massacres being perpetrated against our people inside the  occupied territories will only add to our strength, solidity,  and determination to continue the jihad until the liberation of  land and man.

Regarding the settlements, he said everything depends on how  the Israelis and the Palestinians handle this issue, which is  more difficult and complicated now than it used to be when the  Camp David Accords were signed. As to Jerusalem, the president  emphasized its special status among the adherents of Islam,  Christianity, and Judaism all of whom attach a sacred character  to the city.    These remarks came in an interview conducted by the  well-known television commentator Dan Rather and broadcast by  CBS Television early today.    In response to a question, President Mubarak said that  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat wishes to go to Jericho but  is delaying the trip until the funds he promised the  Palestinians become available because it will be difficult for  him to go there ""empty-handed.""    President Mubarak emphatically denied any prospect of  Egypt's  becoming ""another Iran."" He declared: ""Egypt cannot turn into  an Iran or any other country. It is an ancient country with  very deep roots and a 7,000-year old civilization.""    He added: ""We are able to confront terrorist acts in this  country.""    Concerning the greatest current threat to the peace  operation, President Mubarak said: ""The main obstacle is the  settlements and how the Palestinians and Israelis handle this  issue.""    Asked if that is the primary problem, President Mubarak  said:  ""Yes. I remember that there were 48 small settlements when the  Camp David Accords were signed. Now there are 180 settlements  and this makes the problem much more difficult and complicated  than ever before. Also, there is the Jerusalem issue which is a  sacred place for Arabs, Muslims, Christians, and Jews.""    On whether he doubts Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat  will  go to Jericho this month, his excellency replied: ""I recently  heard that he is ready to go but is postponing the trip until  the aid funds become available. I believe he wishes to go but  if he arrives there empty-handed, it will be a very difficult  matter for his people to accept.""    Asked if Yasir 'Arafat will able to govern after a life of  armed struggle, President Mubarak said: ""Let's be realistic.  'Arafat is facing tremendous difficulties but he is the best  man for this mission now. I know him very well.""    In answer to a question about whether Yasir 'Arafat can do  what Nelson Mandela did in South Africa, namely forgive,  President Mubarak said: ""I believe that 'Arafat is willing to  forgive. They can unite and cooperate for the good of the  people.""    On whether he thinks it is time to reduce the economic  sanctions on Iraq, although President Saddam Husayn is still in  power, President Mubarak remarked: ""It is a problem. We  sympathize with the suffering Iraqi nation but not with Saddam  Husayn himself.""    In answer to a question on whether he favors selling Iraqi  oil on the international market at this time, his excellency  said: ""If it is for the people's good and if the revenue from  such sales can be controlled and used to bring prosperity to the  people, then I agree.""    Asked if Iran poses a major threat to regional peace and  security, President Mubarak said: ""The Iranians are dead set  against the peace process.""    Regarding the possibility that Egypt might turn into another  Iran, President Mubarak said: ""Egypt will never be another Iran  or any other country. Egypt is a country with a long history  and a 7,000-year civilization. We are quite able to confront  terrorist acts in this country.""     "

This is all the more  significant if one knows that the French foreign minister  insisted on the usefulness of such contacts. Mr. Jovanovic, I  would like to ask you to assess your visit to France and your  talks with the French officials briefly for Radio Television of  Serbia.    [Jovanovic] Let me say right away that we are satisfied with  this visit and talks with all the French officials both as far  as the protocol and the contents are concerned. We have seen  everywhere the same regret that the friendship resulting from  history and the common faith of our countries in the two World  Wars has been seriously disrupted because of the negative policy  that France has conducted toward our country, particularly  recently. We have also agreed that there is a common interest  in repairing the damage as soon as possible, and that the policy  should be renewed which -- both sides have agreed -- is in the  interests of both sides and the stability and cooperation in  Europe.    On the other hand, we could see that the time was over when  our country and its policy were criticized, not to mention other  kinds of insinuations, and that we have not heard in these talks  any such criticism. On the contrary, there was a lot of  emphasis on our views and attitudes concerning the situation and  the development of the crisis on the Yugoslav territory, and  particularly in connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina. In that  sense, it has been made more than implicitly clear to us that  our country is seen as an unavoidable factor and respected  partner in the joint effort in the search for peace, and not as  a country that [word indistinct] or a country that still has to  sit on the bench for the accused.    [Komrakov] As we have learned, you insisted with the French  foreign minister -- as far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned --  on an equal status and treatment of all the sides, all three  warring sides, and of course you again insisted on the lifting  of the sanctions against Yugoslavia.    [Jovanovic] During all these talks, particularly with Mr.  Juppe, we pointed out that the European Union owes our country  and the Serb side in Bosnia, because of the plan of the European  Union itself, the plan that we have accepted, which is very  important for the preservation of the credibility of the  European Union in our eyes, and the perspective of our  continuous partnership cooperation in the search for peace and  an overall settlement of the Yugoslav crisis.    [Komrakov] Were your French collocutors aware of the fact  that it was the French official policy -- with some steps and  moves -- that has contributed to the disruption of the  traditionally good relations between France and Serbia?    [Jovanovic] The French side has found it necessary to  mention itself some negative acts toward us in the solution of  the Bosnian crisis recently. However, at the same time it wants  to convince us that it has done so out of good, not bad,  intentions toward us, and that their acts have been forced by  tactical reasons to avoid an even less favorable development,  and to gain ground to exert pressure on the other side, which --  by the way -- used to be insensitive to outside pressure.    [Komrakov] Thank you for the interview, Mr. Jovanovic.     "

While so far authorities have  assumed that the right-wing extremist scene is largely torn by  strife, now constitutional protectors admit that they have  underestimated the interlacement of the groups.    The slogan of ""Marching separately, striking together,""  which  was issued by the late neo-Nazi leader Michael Kuehnen, is  increasingly being followed. Controlled by the supra-regional  cadre organization ""New Front Association of Like-Minded  People,"" individual groups at home and abroad are coordinating  their activities through magazines, information telephones, and  mailbox systems.    The militant nature of the scene is also alarming: By the  end of 1993 the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations had  reported 1,814 acts of violence with right-wing extremist  motives. Eight people were killed; in 1992 there were 17 deaths.    The Right-Wing Extremist Scene in Germany    Parties:    The Republikaner (REP): Founded in Munich in 1983.  [Chairman Franz] Schoenhuber tries to draw a line between the  party and militant neo-Nazis. Many ex-Republikaner have good  contacts with the neo-Nazi scene. About 25,000 members.    German League for People and Homeland (DL): Collection point  for former members of the Republikaner and the NPD [National  Democratic Party].

National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD): In terms of  personnel it is closely linked to the neo-Nazi scene. It took  in members of the German Alternative, cooperates with the Viking  Youth, and has contacts with Worch (National List, New Front of  Like-Minded People). About 5,000 members. Its chairman is  Guenter Deckert.    German People's Union (DVU): With 26,000 members it is one  of the largest right-wing extremist organizations. Publisher  [Gerhard] Frey (DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG) cooperates with the  Russian fascist Zhirinovskiy. It has contacts with the DL.    Liberal German Workers Party (FAP): The only openly national  socialist party. Has taken in many activists of the National  Offensive, the German Alternative, and the Nationalist Front.  Attracts attention by marches and militant actions. About 220  members. Its chairman is Friedhelm Busse.    Umbrella Organization:    New Front of Like-Minded People (GdNF): The GdNF considers  itself as the cadre organization of the right-wing movement in  Germany. Its goal is the new establishment of the NSDAP  [National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazi party]. The  GdNF coordinates nationwide actions and has contact with foreign  right- wing extremists. All leading German neo-Nazis belong to  it. The head of the GdNF is Christian Worch.    Banned Organizations:    German Alternative (DA): The strongest militant neo-Nazi  group in the new laender: 350 members. Active in particular in  Saxony and Brandenburg. Banned on 10 December 1992. Many of its  members have joined the NPD. Its chairman was Frank Huebner.    Nationalist Front (NF): A militant organization headed by  ex-NPD member [Meinolf] Schoenborn, it had weapons and  ammunition. It was banned on 27 November 1992. A large number  of its 130 activists gathered in the Central German Youth  Promotion Project.    National Offensive (NO): This is a collection point for  disillusioned FAP members in Bavaria, Saxony, and Brandenburg.  It intended to form ""autonomous structures."" It was banned on  22 December 1992; it had 150 members at the last count. Its  chairman was Michael Swierczek.    Organizations:    National List (NL): Founded by Kuehnen followers in Hamburg  in 1989. The NL considers itself as a ""spearhead"" and often  appears as the organizer of rightist meetings. The NL has about  30 members, and its leader is Christian Worch.    German Hesse (DH): It is a small but striking group. The  leaders belong to the inner circle of the German neo-Nazi scene.  It cultivates contacts with the Viking Youth, the FAP, and the  banned DA. It has about 60 members. Heinz Reisz is the group's  leader.    Viking Youth (WJ): The oldest right-wing extremist  organization in Germany, it was founded in 1952. In tent camps  young people get paramilitary training. It has contacts with  the NPD and has about 400 members. Its leader is Wolfgang  Nahrath.    Central German Youth Promotion Project (FMJ): This is  considered to be the successor organization of the banned DA and  NF. It is primarily active in Brandenburg.

He added that the Palestinians do not support such  acts, and make every effort to put end to violence in the  region. The remarks were made after the Palestinian military  delegation held a meeting with Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that no one can  guarantee that the attack in 'Afula will be the last. At the  same time, every effort will be made to cut off the arms of the  murderers and harm the terror organization which aspires to  murder all that is good in the Middle East. Minister Peres  further said that grave incidents had been expected, but the  attack in 'Afula was graver than could be expected. He added  that the government will make security-related decisions, and  rejected the opposition parties' demand that a commission of  inquiry be set up to investigate the incident. Such murders  took place when the Likud was in power, and even before the  peace talks started, Peres said.    [In a live telephone interview on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in  Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 6 April, Foreign Minister Peres says: ""I  do not believe that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] asks or  needs 'Arafat's permission to carry out such attacks. For the  time being, 'Arafat is not on the ground here. When he enters  the region, we will examine his conduct in the region under his  jurisdiction."" Asked about the opposition demand to suspend the  negotiations with the PLO in the wake of the attack, he said:  ""I see no connection between the two issues.""]    Minister Yosi Sarid said that the circumstances of the  attack  in 'Afula will be thoroughly studied. He rejected the demands  that the peace talks be suspended claiming that the terrorists  should not be given a prize for their acts. At the same time,  he said, we must fight terrorism to the end.    Deputy Agriculture Minister Walid Sadiq condemned the grave  attack in 'Afula, and called for restraint. Deputy Health  Minister Nayif Musaliha said that the terrorists intend to  murder the peace process and the relations between Jews and  Arabs in Israel.    Knesset Member [MK] Yosi Katz, deputy chairman of the Labor  faction, said that the bloody attack proves that the government  must go on with the peace process, and not be deterred by  attempts by extremists to torpedo it.    Meretz faction Chairman Ran Kohen called on the prime  minister and the PLO head not to retreat, and to speed up the  exit of Israelis from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    HADASH [Democratic Front for Peace and Equality] faction  Chairman Tawfiq Zayyad condemned the attack, saying that it  poisons the atmosphere and harms the political process.    The National Religious Party said that the 'Afula attack is  the outcome of the Rabin government's policy of groveling.    Moledet said that the 'Afula massacre is an indication of  what is to happen once the recipe for peace, prepared by the  government and the PLO, is implemented.    Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that MK Ravitz of the  United Torah Jewry demanded that the prime minister set up a  state commission of inquiry to examine the events that led to  the attack in 'Afula.    Likud MK 'Ovadya Eli, who used to be 'Afula mayor, demanded  that peace talks be stopped at once, and that their continuation  be made conditional on a Palestinian commitment to prevent  additional acts of terror from taking place.

According to government edicts published at the weekend, anyone actively involved with Al Arqam, a sect which claims 100,000 followers in Malaysia and many more in surrounding countries, is liable to arrest, flogging and imprisonment. Earlier this month, Malaysia's national Fatwa council, the body that rules on Islamic orthodoxy, said Al Arqam teachings were deviationist. More than 30 of the sect's followers were arrested over the weekend. Malaysian non-government organisations and the country's bar council have expressed concern that the government's moves violate human rights.

Many Golkar functionaries in the provinces  have resorted to acts of defiance in the election of local  regents by rejecting the candidates backed by its central board  or the central government.    These acts within the Golkar rank and file in the provinces  which have come to be dubbed ""undercurrents"", have been so  frequent that many observers view them as positive phenomena in  the development of the country's political system.    Although in nearly all of the cases, Golkar's local  politicians lost the cause, the inspiring aspect of their  rejection of directives is that they now have the boldness to  say ""no"" in situations in which they would previously have  responded with total passivity. Every citizen here -- outside  and inside the ruling political organization -- is quite aware  that Golkar leaders are supposed to toe the government line.    Most observers would probably agree that although provincial  politicians might have been a bit extreme in expressing their  views, the central government has not been totally right in its  aggressive effort to make local legislators accept its  candidates. Minister of Home Affairs Yogi S. Memet withdrew his  gubernatorial candidate for Central Kalimantan after the latter  won local election but was subsequently widely opposed by the  local leaders.    However, President Suharto refuses to recognize the  existence  of a trend. The head of state, in his capacity as chief patron  of the Golkar, said in written message to the party leaders on  Monday that there was no such thing as ""undercurrents"". In his  view, the situation reflects no more than the fact that a few  people claimed to speak on behalf of the masses.    Suharto's notion could be viewed as a call for Golkar  leaders  to set the organization's house in order. It is their internal  problem.    But because the tendency is becoming more popular here now,  the question is whether all political engineering -- which  Suharto said cannot be separated from politics -- has a negative  connotation? To Suharto the tendency toward more vocal local  stances in the Golkar hierarchy might look like old-fashioned  politicking because it does not introduce any positive way of  thinking. But in other places, such as within the Indonesian  Democratic Party (PDI), this type of ""political engineering"" has  managed to channel the aspirations of the younger generation who  rejected any candidate for the party leadership with a clear  leaning toward the establishment. They believed that this kind  of person would not be able to make the PDI a viable party.    During its congress at the end of last year, many young  leaders of the PDI were of the opinion that the congress must be  able to elect a strong and popular leader who would be able to  put an end to the party's long history of internal squabbles  once and for all. And to achieve this, they should also lend  their ears to the young people, who had become more and more  expressive. The younger ones were making an effort to gain  wider participation within the party, a legal and normal crusade  within a democratic country, where leaders are expected to be  open and wise.    Whether or not President Suharto specifically meant the  recent extra high profile activities among Golkar leaders in the  provinces when he spoke about undercurrents, when looking at the  reasons behind the new tendency we believe that it is not  political engineering but political professionalism which has  begun to gain a foothold. And this can be expected to provide  Golkar with a more colorful political spectrum.     "

The legislation, which President Bill Clinton strongly supports and will sign, was prompted by actions taken against abortion clinics in recent years, including cases of arson, bombing and, last year, the murder of a doctor in Florida and the shooting of another in Kansas. The bill, laying out penalties for offenders, was vigorously opposed by the right-to-life movement on the grounds that it infringed lawful civil disobedience. But the only concession was to grant similar protection to houses of worship. Opponents of abortion suffered a second, if less decisive, defeat yesterday when a House subcommittee voted against excluding abortion coverage from the healthcare bill.

The iron-like will and tested leadership  ability of our party have been more vigorously demonstrated in  stern struggles recently.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Recently,  we have vigorously proven once again in the stern trials and  struggles that our party is the great party with an iron-like  will and tested leadership ability, that our people are the  heroic people with a firm revolutionary faith and indomitable  struggling spirit, and that socialism of our own style which  embodied the chuche idea is the invincible socialism deeply  rooted in the popular masses. The iron-like will and tested  leadership ability are a basic criterion for the working class  party leading the revolution. The working class party can  overcome any trials, and victoriously lead the people, and  consummate its historic cause to the end only if it cherishes  the iron-like will and tested leadership ability. Therefore, it  is very fortunate for the people to live under the leadership of  the great party with an invincible might.    Today, our party has widely demonstrated its might as a  great  party with iron-like will and tested leadership ability by  upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the head.  Above all, the iron-like will and tested leadership ability of  our party are being clearly demonstrated in firmly leading our  people on the socialist road, thus constantly upholding the  revolutionary banner of the chuche idea.    The historic mission of the working class party lies in  building the socialist and communist society. The will and  leadership ability of the party can be vigorously demonstrated  in adhering to the socialist cause and in leading it to victory.  Furthermore, firmly adhering to the socialist cause and  victoriously carrying it out today are emerging as important  matters related to the destiny of mankind.    In recent years, socialism collapsed in some countries. With  this, imperialists and reactionaries are babbling about  socialism coming to an end. Also, they are more viciously  conducting antisocialist plots. However, our party is firmly  leading the socialist cause down the single road of chuche with  its iron-like will and tested leadership ability that will not  falter at any antisocialist plot. It is the invincible will of  our party to endlessly consummate the socialist cause by  upholding the banner of the chuche idea without the slightest  hesitation and backwardness in any difficult situation or trial.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's works, such as  The Historic Lesson of Socialist Construction and the  General Line of Our Party, On the Fundamental  Question of Revolutionary Party Building, and Abuses  of Socialism Are Intolerable, have vigorously demonstrated  our party's determination on how it is firm in consummating the  socialist cause. Our party has learned lessons from the  collapse of socialism in some countries and is vigorously moving  forward by invoking wisdom and by showing courage of turning a  misfortune into a blessing, thus resolutely refuting the  reactionaries' plots against socialism.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has always made it a  rule to solve all problems in conformity with the aspiration of  the people and actual conditions of our country. The dear  comrade leader has developed and consummated the chuche  socialist idea and has enabled the popular masses to strongly  arm themselves with it to strengthen the main force of the  revolution. With its might, he has lead our country to be ever  victorious.    Even when the socialist betrayers threw away the socialist  principle and moved toward wholly accepting the capitalistic  political method and economic system, we firmly adhered to the  chuche-oriented position, thoroughly embodied the Taean work  system, and implemented the rural theses. This clearly proves  our party's revolutionary leadership.    Truly, our party's leadership is a fundamental source that  made it possible to further consolidate and develop socialism of  our own style. Our party's iron-like will and refined  leadership are also manifest in leading the revolution and  construction toward endless upsurges with far-reaching  aspirations and ideals and without the slightest stagnation or  stalemate.    The socialist cause is a long-term cause that accompanies a  serious social change and large scale construction work. This  cause can advance victoriously only when endless struggle is  launched through far-reaching aspirations and ideals. We are  leading the socialist construction toward the one road of rapid  progress without the slightest stagnation and stalemate by  always highly upholding the banner of continued revolution.  Here lies the resoluteness of the working-class party's will  and invincible leadership.    Our party is an experienced and ambitious revolutionary  party  endlessly advancing and struggling with the far-reaching  aspiration and ideal for the bright future of socialism and  communism. Our party's firm position is to continue revolution  to the end until imperialism is wiped out on this land and the  banner of socialism's victory flies high. Therefore, our party  is firmly adhering to and vigorously pushing ahead with the  three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--and  is resolutely adhering to the revolutionary principle and  socialist principle under whatever circumstance.    Because of our party's wise leadership which leads socialist  construction by unfolding an extraordinary high goal and far-  reaching blueprint and mobilizes the popular masses'  revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity to look ahead into the  distant future, unprecedented miracles and innovations are being  created in our country, and many great monumental creations that  elucidate the era of the Workers Party are being built.    Our party has the strong will and militant base that does  not  yield to difficult situations, does not boast of victory, and  which vigorously advances toward a new goal. Last year, on the  occasion of the 40th anniversary of the victory of war, the  party Central Committee announced its slogans to call the whole  party, the whole country, and all the people, thus achieving a  great revolutionary upsurge and brilliantly decorating the 40th  anniversary of the victory of war as a great festival of  victors. Also, at the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth party  Central Committee, a revolutionary economic strategy organizing  and mobilizing the whole party, the whole country, and all the  people toward a new general march was presented. This is clear  manifestation of our party's iron-like will and refined  leadership.    Although our people were faced with great difficulties and  barriers due to the unexpected international events and the  acute situation created in the country, they consistently rose  to create mass heroism and collective innovation without the  slightest wavering and with revolutionary optimism and faith in  victory, because of our party's leadership.    Today, our people are overflowing with confidence that when  they move according to our party's leadership, there is nothing  in this world that cannot be achieved and no trial or difficulty  that cannot be resolutely overcome to occupy a high peak in  socialism.    Possessed with an iron-like will and refined leadership, our  party takes pride as a great party leading the socialist cause  toward the one road of being ever victorious. This wholly lies  in the fact that our party is highly upholding the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il. The dear comrade leader's iron faith and  peerless courage comprise our party's iron-like will and his  extraordinary ability and leadership capability comprise our  party's refined leadership.    The faith and will possessed by the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il is an iron-like will which does not waver with any kind  of thunder and lightning and which does not shake even with the  attack of a myriad of powerful enemies. It is also a peerless  courage that achieves victory in revolution by turning  misfortune to good fortune and an adverse situation into a  favorable one.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is shown  in  the great decisive step of taking the initiative to overcome  difficulties in revolution through dauntless operations; in the  extraordinary organizational capability of achieving the final  victory ahead of schedule by always thrusting oneself toward the  attack line; and in the revolutionary leadership art that  provides a new upsurge of revolutionary offensive by calling  forth at once the whole party, all the people, and the whole  country.    Because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's wise  leadership encompasses wisdom of keen insight, peerless courage,  and refined leadership, our party is highly manifesting to the  whole world, the dignity of a militant party which possesses  invincible, ever-victorious leadership, and our party is highly  manifesting to the whole world the dignity of a heroic people  possessed with revolutionary faith.    Our people will adhere to the socialist banner according to  the leadership of the great party and leader [suryong] to the  end, and will brilliantly build socialism of our own style  centered on the popular masses.

0,FT934-7500 ,"FT934-7500 _AN-DKSDHAEHFT 931119   FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: Zender's 'Don Quijote' - Opera in Stuttgart and New York      By ANDREW CLARK   'Happy New Ears'. The greeting comes from the 56-year old German conductor-composer Hans Zender, an increasingly vociferous member of his country's musical avant-garde. As the title of a book of recent essays, it represents not just his disillusionment with traditional forms of opera, but his desire to set music theatre on a radical new course. Zender's first opera - heavily influenced by his mentor Bernd Alois Zimmermann - was Stephen Climax (1986), in which two separate plots unfold simultaneously. Now comes Don Quijote de la Mancha, in which Zender isolates five components of opera - speech, song, instrumental music, action and scenery - and subjects them to the maximum number of permutations. The result is '31 theatrical adventures', premiered at the Wurttemberg State Theatre in Stuttgart and already scheduled for a second staging at the 1995 Salzburg Festival. This is deconstruction writ large. The 31 scenes unfold like revue sketches, each lasting three to six minutes - except the 16-minute finale to the first half, the only scene in which all five components come together. You have speech without song or action; sound without scenery; action without sound; scenery alone - and so on. Zender gives precise instructions on decor, gesture, timing and rhythm, but says the order and number of scenes can be changed. The only leitmotif is Cervantes' eccentric, flamboyant knight, who emerges as little more than a comic cartoon-strip character. As just one of five equal components, the music is marginalised. It is most effective at its most conventional, as in the flurry of staccato trumpet and horn calls accompanying the windmill scene. Elsewhere, Zender's serialism is unremittingly arid and cool. Voices - including three 'readers' - often swamp each other. To sustain interest, the piece relies on visual variety, requiring spans of concentration no longer than a pop video programme. But in contrast to today's pop videos, Don Quijote de la Mancha is all intellect and no feeling. Content is secondary to technique; unity and harmony are replaced by bloodless dissection; art is reduced to a mathematical formula. We have been up the same cul-de-sac before - with Cage's Europeras among others. Such experiments, aimed at shaping the future of opera on a super-rational basis rather than organically, serve only to trivialise the human and technical resources of a traditional opera house. Don Quijote might have more to say in a production showing less respect for theatrical norms. The Stuttgart producer and designer Axel Manthey made no attempt to break the barrier between stage and auditorium, relying instead on a few electronic sound-effects and a sequence of eye-catching stage pictures inspired by Pop Art. Some of the action had a Pythonesque touch, as when Don Quixote and Sancho Panza tried obsessively to duel with their shadows. David Pittman-Jennings and Dieter Bundschuh made a heroic leading pair, backed by 16 other singers and a small orchestra under Bernhard Kontarsky. None of their efforts could mask the work's blatant tedium.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.   Industries:-  P7922 Theatrical Producers and Services.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, one of the leaders behind the  fundamentalist groups in Denmark, instigates acts of terrorism  -- including those against Danish firms and Danish tourists in  Egypt -- from his home in the Copenhagen area.    He is under sentence of death for his part in the  assassination of the Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat in 1981.  The Egyptian state has requested his extradition from Denmark,  but Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim has been granted political asylum in  Denmark and cannot, therefore, be handed over to Egypt.    ""Kill the infidels and join the fight for an Islamic state  in  Egypt,"" Islamic fundamentalists urge in mosques throughout  Denmark.    For Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim and the other fundamentalists the  purpose of the terrorism is to create economic chaos and social  unrest in Egypt, so as to overturn President Mubarak's moderate  government.    ""The radical Islamic fundamentalists are dangerous, and can  easily plan and carry out acts of terrorism from Europe,"" one  Islamic expert predicts.    But the Danish asylum authorities have no opportunity of  assessing whether or not those seeking asylum are members of  international terrorist organizations. The asylum authorities  may not check the identity of those seeking asylum either with  Interpol or with the police in their country of origin.    In Egypt he is considered to be one of the leaders behind  the  extremist Islamic groups which, with their bases outside the  country, attempt to overthrow the Egyptian Government and set up  an Islamic state. He himself does not hide his links with  al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic group], one of the most violent  and fundamentalist Islamic groups in Egypt.    The left-wing Egyptian newspaper AL-AHALI recently published  an interview with Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, [see p. 39 of 6 October  1993 Terrorism Report] in which he made threats against foreign  tourists and investments in Egypt, including Danish firms such  as A.P. Moeller, F.L. Smidth, and Aarhus Flydedok, which operate  in Egypt, and the 2,000 or so Danish tourists who holiday there  each year.    ""Tourism is a non-Islamic source of income which helps keep  the present government in power, and foreigners have been warned  to stay away from Egypt,"" Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim told the Egyptian  paper.    ""The radical Muslim leaders such as Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim  living in various places in Europe and the United States pose a  very real threat to their countries, and it is easy for them to  send orders for actions, money, or tapes with religious  propaganda to members of the fanatical groups in Egypt, for  example,"" Hesham Mubarak, a lawyer currently writing a book on  radical Islamic groups and their international network, told  POLITIKEN.    Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim is a well-known figure in fundamentalist  circles. In 1981 he was arrested as one of the leaders of the  banned fanatical group Jihad (Holy War), which later that year  was behind the assassination of President Anwar al-Sadat. In  1989 he succeeded in escaping while being moved with other  prisoners. Via the Sudan and Peshawar in Pakistan, he reached  Afghanistan where, in the same way as Sheik 'Umar  'Abd-al-Rahman, thought to be the brains behind the World Trade  Center bombing, he was one of the leaders behind the Muslim  fundamentalist volunteers who helped the Afghan Mojahidin in the  fight against the occupying Soviet power.    The Egyptian authorities have requested that Denmark hand  over Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, but he need not fear ending his days  on Egypt's gallows. [see p. 21 of 28 December 1993 Terrorism  Report]    ""People who have obtained asylum in Denmark are not returned  to their own country if there is a death sentence awaiting  them,"" Justice Minister Erling Olsen said.

The official New China News Agency reported that Wang, 54, a respected author,  had asked to step down ""to concentrate on writing and literary criticism.""    But Wang's removal, which had been rumored for days, is widely viewed as part  of a continuing purge of reformist officials associated with former Communist  Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who was removed from his post in June  after opposing the use of martial-law troops to suppress student-led  pro-democracy demonstrations.    In a related development, news services reported that the governor of Hainan  province, Liang Xiang, has also been fired. Liang, 70, also an associate of  Zhao, is the highest-level provincial official to be removed from office.    Western diplomats said his firing would have implications for foreign investors  and for China's economic reforms, because Hainan had been slated to take the  lead in the country's experiments with capitalistic forms of trade and  investment.    The pro-Communist Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po, which reported Liang's  dismissal Sunday, said the governor is under investigation for corruption.      Replaced by Hard-Liner    Wang's replacement apparently will be He Jingzhi, a recently appointed vice  minister of culture, who is a poet but whose reputation is primarily that of a  hard-line propagandist.    He, who most recently has been deputy head of the Communist Party Propaganda  Department, had served previously as a vice minister of culture. He was  reappointed to that post last week and was also named acting head of the  ministry, state-run television reported Monday. He also has been named head of  the Communist Party structure within the ministry.    Wang, who became minister of culture in 1986, encouraged a loosening of  controls on literature and the arts. Among the most dramatic symbols of the new  openness were several controversial art shows in Beijing during the last year,  including one devoted entirely to paintings of nudes.    He, in contrast, has been a leading advocate of ideological orthodoxy. He  played key roles in promoting a 1983 campaign against ""spiritual pollution"" and  an ""anti-bourgeois liberalization"" drive in 1987. Both campaigns were aimed at  attacking Western influences.      New Wave of Criticism    Since this June's crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators, and Zhao's  fall from power, a new wave of criticism has been launched against pornography  and any literature viewed as advocating allegedly decadent foreign life styles.  This new campaign now is likely to get a further boost from He.    ""Literary and art circles are part of the ideological front,"" He declared in an  April, 1987, speech, during the height of that year's anti-bourgeois  liberalization campaign. ""Our opposition to bourgeois liberalization is aimed  at strengthening our Marxist world outlook and our Marxist concept of  literature and art. . . . We must advocate depicting the bright side of things  and depicting advanced and heroic figures. Only by doing so can we inspire the  people to stride forward.""    He is considered a protege of former Propaganda Minister Deng Liqun, a  hard-line ideologue who has been in semi-retirement since 1987 but who remains  one of the orthodox figures most feared by reformist intellectuals.

Having introduced us to  the persistence of heroic myth through the writings of the late Joseph  Campbell, Moyers now commends or commands our attention to the sadly  underconsumed art of poetry.    Moyers' six-part series on poetry, ""The Power of the Word,"" premieres tonight  at 9 along the PBS network, including Channels 28 and 15.    Poetry, the Mexican poet-diplomat Octavio Paz says during the program, was once  the central art of society. Today it is at best a marginal art. He adds that  the United States has in the 20th Century produced some of the great poets of  the world. Paz hardly needs to point out that not one would qualify as a  household name.    Moyers offers a graceful and low-key introduction. ""When I tell you this series  is about poetry, some of you are going to reach for the dial,"" he says with  fair accuracy. And yet, Moyers argues, the poets have ""told him what they felt  about falling in love, facing death, leaving home, losing faith, finding God,  or seeing Magic Johnson do ballet with a basketball"" (Quincy Troupe's ""A Poem  for 'Magic,' "" to be heard in the second program of the series).    Having made his personal case for the pleasures of listening to poetry, Moyers  turns the program over to five poets, observed reading their work and talking  about it during the 1988 session of the biennial Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry  Festival in New Jersey.    The first program, subtitled ""The Simple Acts of Life,"" makes no attempt (nor  does the series as a whole, evidently) to assess the state of poetry. A  marginal art it undoubtedly still is, yet there are plenty of signs of vitality  -- readings, recordings, radio appearances, small press publications, organized  pressure on newspapers to print more poetry and reviews.    Direct expression -- immediate experience conveyed in language intended to be  heard more than read -- seems central to a renewed popularity of the poetic  word. And accessibility, relatively plain speech spiced with warmth and wit, is  a linking chord among the first show's performers: Robert Bly, Galway Kinnell,  Sharon Olds, Paz and William Stafford.    Olds, who heads the creative writing program at NYU, and Kinnell, the 1983  Pulitzer Prize winner for poetry, who also teaches at NYU, are both impressive  in the candor of their poetry itself and for their unpretentious and concrete  talk about the making of the poetry.    Yet Olds, giving a poem about her father a first public reading, is clearly  taken aback at the end by the reawakening of the strong emotions that inspired  the poem in the first place.    Olds and Kinnell conclude the program with an antiphonal reading of excerpts  from their work on the common theme of sex. It is wonderfully affecting,  neither coy nor within miles of prurience, but the private experience made  universal: sex, and poetry, at their best.    The program's background music is by The Paul Winter Consort. Dominated by  flute and soprano saxophone, it is wispily, mournfully elegant. But it does  reinforce the image of modern poetry as esoteric and elitist, which the poets  themselves have been doing a fine job of contradicting.    Save for some pretty shots of the autumnal East, the program is talking heads  in the oldest PBS tradition.

Representatives and leaders of the transportation sector and 5  July Cooperative President Eudis Febres, 5 July Cooperative  Treasurer Saul Verdones, and Jesus Aquiles Rondon, secretary  general of the Bus Drivers Union, think it is suspicious that  the protest began with the burning of tires at approximately  0730 and that the police did not arrive until after midday.    Very few students participated in the incidents. The few  that  did are activists of the Democratic Action Party [AD] and were  led by Eudis Marin. We have no idea how he is connected to these  incidents. We have learned that Marin is not a student but an AD  activist.     "

The most  important thing is to unite the thoughts of officers and men on  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  the party's basic line, the party's reform principles, and the  military commission's policies to ensure that they maintain a  high degree of unanimity with the party Central Committee and  the Central Military Commissions at all times and under all  circumstances.    Zhang Wannian said: To quicken the establishment of the  socialist market economic system, the party and state have  introduced a series of major reform measures. Deepening reform  and adjusting interest patterns will definitely arouse different  reactions from society. Only by deepening the study of Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and mastering  the key to the correct understanding of various issues can we  profoundly understand the correctness of central policies, thus  enabling us to properly handle the pattern of interests and  adjust relations among different interests, particularly when  reform measures involve the personal interests of some officers  and men. Further, only through such measures can we keep the  fundamental interests of the country and people in mind,  properly handle and take the overall interest into  consideration, as well as consciously maintain a high degree of  unanimity with the party Central Committee and the Central  Military Commissions on ideology and politics.    Zhang Wannian asked leading cadres at all levels to stand  for  the party and people. He called on them to, through theoretical  studies, correctly understand domestic and international  situations, correctly understand and handle various complex  social phenomena, strenghten their sense of hardship, always  maintain a sober attitude, firmly remember the army's  fundamental functions, steadfastly comply with the command of  the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission  with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, and contribute to the  country's reform, opening up, and stability.    Zhang Wannian asked military organizations at all levels to  vigorously cultivate proper work styles. They should strongly  encourage healthy trends and combat unhealthy work styles by  conducting education in revolutionary soldiers' professional  ethics; education in the army's glorious tradition; discipline  education; and education in anticorruption and clean  administration. They should strongly promote the work styles of  attaching importance to the army's cause and downplaying fame  and wealth; taking overall interest into consideration and  safeguarding unity; strictly upholding principle and discipline;  seeking truth from facts and doing pragmatic work; showing  friendliness and sincerity toward people; practicing fairness  and uprightness instead of favoritism; and maintaining unanimity  in thoughts and actions as well as complete openness. They  should actively struggle against liberalism, individualism,  hedonism, and money-worship ideologies. It is necessary to  respond to President Jiang Zemin's call and enthusiastically  implement activities for emulating heroic soldier Comrade Xu  Honggang, further carry forward healthy revolutionary trends,  and cultivate good morality. It is necessary to strengthen  training in party spirit, establish a revolutionary outlook on  life and value standards, and create a good environment for  satisfactorily completing various tasks entrusted by the party  Central Committee and the Central Military Commissions.

0,FT924-15974 ,"FT924-15974 _AN-CJACYAFBFT 921001   FT  01 OCT 92 / Arts: Il Trovatore - Opera      By DAVID MURRAY   In Mark Brickman's new Scottish Opera production, Verdi's great melodrama seems a very archetype: absurd story, great tunes, nothing much else. The first-night audience accepted it happily in that spirit, so it may count as a success. Darkly lit by Ben Ormerod, Tim Hatley's sets - tall strips of moveable wall, curved this way and that for different scenes - serve well enough, as they might for many another opera. Brickman's directorial hand is visible only in the same sort of way: the soloists are moved carefully from place to place (some waving their arms more, some less), but otherwise left to their own routine devices. Some routines, of course, are better than others. The chorus were drilled to a Dalek unanimity. Super-careful articulation robbed their music of full Italianate fervour, though they can make a lusty sound, and their anvils in the Anvil Chorus were terrific. As the hero's rebel troop rescued the heroine from the villain's forces with ludicrous tameness, however, we got the surtitle 'All sense of reason is gone'; for a moment one thought that Verdi, like Strauss later, must inadvertently have set a stage-direction to music. The Australian soprano Lisa Gasteen (Cardiff winner last year) made a stately, placid Leonora, varying her facial expression from gracious smile to worried frown as the action required. Big voice, attractively warm; technique not equal yet to sharp rhythms, and rapport with the conductor decidedly weak. As the hero Manrico, Kenneth Collins gave us his reliable, all-purpose, hell-for-leather impersonation of the archetypal Italian tenor  -short on finesse, maybe, but firmly committed and sometimes stirring. For subtlety of colour and dramatic response (even in a vacuum), there were visiting Slavs to admire. The gypsy Azucena was Ludmila Nam, a mezzo from Kazakhstan whose exotic facial cast lent a bonus to a mature and generously felt performance. The Muscovite Vladimir Redkin has a dusky, 'inward' timbre at his disposal as well as heroic menace, and his Count di Luna was less of a bully than usual, more a creature of private anguish. On this showing, the conductor Richard Armstrong is not well attuned yet to middle-period Verdi. The pace of the music was often heavy-footed, despite the occasional manic rush forward; what should be rapt, suspended moments were regularly jostled.

The last act, which crowns Il Trovatore as a great melodrama, should exercise a steady, relentless grip, but here it was disappointingly choppy and sectional.

On these blessed days, we are reliving the memory of the 15  Sha'ban uprising, which reflected our heroic Iraqi people's deep  association with great Islam and their readiness to make any  sacrifice for its sake. The uprising also reflected the extent  of injustice and persecution practiced by Saddam's criminal  regime against this zealous people, and the rejection of this  regime by the Iraqi people of all their sects, nationalities,  and social groups. [passage omitted]    On this blessed anniversary, we call on our Iraqi people to  perpetuate the confrontation against the ruling tyranny in  Baghdad. We call on them to be vigilant of the plots being  hatched against our beloved Iraq by its enemies, both Saddam's  gang and the covetous forces that are trying to find a foothold  in Iraq to practice their sabotage mission on behalf of the  arrogant forces that seek to serve their own interests.    On this anniversary, we also remind the world and all  virtuous forces that the Iraqi people are experiencing a major  plight at the hands of Saddam's regime, and are being subjected  to plots of physical liquidation, terrorism, and confiscation of  public and individual freedoms. We call on the world and its  virtuous forces to make continuous efforts to force the ruling  regime in Baghdad to stop its criminal schemes from being  implemented in the Iraqi cities in the north, south, center, and  in the marshlands in particular. The regime is engaged in  operations of pursuits, killing, economic blockade, continuous  dry-up efforts, and annihilation of all features of human life.    We call on the world and the virtuous forces to abandon  their  silence over the Saddam regime's genocide against the Iraqi  people everywhere. We appeal to the Security Council, the  United Nations, and their humanitarian organizations to play  their legal role regarding the crimes and tragedies of Iraq.    O sons of the Armed Forces; O Iraqi officers and soldiers:  The sons of your Iraqi people everywhere have unleashed their  outcry in the face of the criminal tyrant, expressing their  rejection of him. They have paid with their lives and pure blood  for this outcry. They wanted to rid themselves of the tyrant and  its regime and establish a system that ensures their freedom,  independence, dignity, might, and honor. You belong to this  steadfast, brave, mujahid people who seek salvation. This  people calls on you to be the strong and striking force to  topple this criminal tyrant, who has violated dignities and  sanctities, destroyed the country, ruined all its resources, and  forced humiliation, death, displacement, and disgrace on the  Iraqi Army. The Iraqi people warn you against being used by  Saddam to realize his personal whims of despotism, crime, and  corruption.    O honorable officers and soldiers: The current situation  provides the best chance for the Army and the Iraqi people to  join forces and wage the battle against tyranny, crime,  corruption, humiliation, and slavery, a battle for Iraq's  independence and freedom, which Saddam is relinquishing--after  having destroyed everything--to preserve his power.

Mr Laszlo Bekesi, finance minister, warned that despite an upturn in industrial production and in exports, the country's trade and budget deficits were worsening and its net national debt was increasing rapidly. The mini-budget, the government's first important piece of legislation since taking office in July, aims to keep this year's budget deficit to Ft331.9bn - 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product - by increasing revenues by Ft5.5bn and cutting expenditure by Ft4.5bn. The Finance Ministry said that without the corrective measures the deficit could soar to more than Ft385bn. Further cuts in public expenditure and in the bloated welfare system are essential if Hungary is to secure a three-year International Monetary Fund loan package.

The U.S. attitude toward the atrocity, which has claimed 400  casualties, once more exposes America's open and consistent bias  toward the usurper Zionist entity, as well as underscoring its  abiding willingness to extend political protection to that  entity at the United Nations, not to mention the apologies and  alibis afforded the Zionist entity by U.S. media    Typical of its approach to the savageries the Zionist entity  has committed against the Palestinian Arab people, the United  States has, for the past three days, been bending over backwards  not only to contain and deflect the angry reactions to the crime  and its perpetrators and to underplay the bloodbath and its  consequences, but also to shield the Zionist entity from any  international measures. The Clinton administration has not  limited itself to throwing its full weight behind Tel Aviv; it  stands ready to keep the UN Security Council from passing a  resolution decreeing protection for the Palestinian people in  the occupied territories and demanding that the Zionist entity  take immediate measures to curb the illegal practices of the  Zionist settlers.    It was entirely predictable that the draft resolution  submitted by the nonaligned group at the United Nations should  come up against U.S. opposition. Particularly objectionable to  the United States is the paragraph stipulating international  protection for the Palestinian people. Washington argues that  such a resolution would set back the ongoing peace process.  Another disagreeable paragraph to the Americans is the one  calling on Israel to curb the settlers' scandalous actions  against the Palestinian population. Beyond that, the United  States has come out against disarming these settlers!    At the end of the day, what the Clinton administration  really  wants is for the negotiations to resume. As for stemming the  flow of Palestinian blood, it could not be bothered. Seen  against this backdrop, Clinton's call for the  Palestinian-Israeli talks to resume in Washington is a wretched  and transparent attempt to whitewash the Zionist crime and shift  the attention of the Palestinian, Arab, and world opinion away  from the atrocity. From a U.S. perspective, the progress of the  talks seems to count for more than Palestinian blood.    In any event, this is not the first time that the United  States has acted disgracefully, nor will it be the last. The  U.S. attitude now fits in with a pattern of open U.S. partiality  to the Zionist enemy. Still fresh in our memory is the crime  perpetrated by the Zionists at al-Aqsa Mosque in October, 1990  and how the Bush administration manipulated the Security Council  into passing a weak resolution condemning violence in general  terms. Will the Clinton administration get the Council to issue  a similarly weak resolution with empty expressions of  condemnation that have no value in the face of this  state-sponsored Zionist terror?!    There is an elementary truth that the imperialists and their  allies and agents will not recognize, and that is that the  Palestinian people, who have been engaged in a bloody and  ceaseless struggle for the past 40-odd years and who have  offered huge sacrifices as they stood up to Zionist coercion and  occupation, are not about to relent in the battle against terror  and repression. The Palestinians will carry on with their heroic  fight and make further sacrifices until their right to an  independent state on their national soil is recognized.     "

That is the  reason why it must be emphasized internal incertitude is  characteristic of the so-called societies in transition. The  reason for such a prognosis is simple -- in such states, the  most-radical and, in many senses, most-sensitive change comes  about, which is in the titular ownership of the social capital,  which was in the hands of the state in the former socialist  countries. The bright side of the coin of privatization is the  establishment of the market economy, when sound competition has  to be the leading factor in the overall economic progress of the  country. When we speak about sound competition, we will allow  ourselves a small digression in the terminological explanation.  Competition (this comes from Latin, meaning contest, rivalry)  is carried out through supply and demand and the game of prices  on one hand, and the action of the competition forms the market  prices of the goods, following the law on the value of goods  production, on the other hand.    However, the transformation of the social capital, the  famous  ""privatization,"" can and has to be viewed as a necessary evil  that must be overcome with as few tremors as possible.  Otherwise, the transformation itself would be transformed into  a general theft that would leave nothing of the state. In such  circumstances, ""sound competition"" becomes unimaginable, and  ""Madame Mafia,"" organized criminal, comes onto the scene.    Awakening in Darkness    Recent Interior Ministry information shows that the  increasing number of acts of committing or concealing criminal  acts causing great damage was characteristic of the last year,  as was the receiving and giving of bribes, causing the  appearance of a more serious dilemma on the surface. According  to the information, this kind of detected criminal act, compared  to 1992 and 1993, has increased 107 percent. The figure itself  -- no matter how hard we try to view it as a conditional  correlation -- points to an alarming situation. In order to  avoid the dilemmas -- it is a fact that Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], compared to most  post-communist countries or societies in transition, is  maintaining a high level of security, which should not and must  not make us self-satisfied. Particularly not when we talk about  the economic crime that is increasing in the country.    On the other hand, when we talk about the phenomena of  ""bribery"" and ""corruption,"" we must stress that they represent  the more difficult forms of economic crime. In keeping with the  way they transpire (most frequently they are done in private, or  through various mediators), they are at the bottom of the list  of proven cases. In other words, the so-called ""black"" figure  of unrevealed criminal acts is the greatest in this area. As a  matter of fact, there is an opinion that the criminal sphere in  which bribery and corruption belong, the least revealed, is  practically the most widespread in reality. Therefore, it  exists, but due to its character, the difficulty of revealing  and proving it, the absence of a practical strategy for its  detection by state organs, it remains in the dark, that is in  the unrevealed crime range.    If we go back to the introductory views on the high risk of  privatization, with the presumption that the dominance of social  ownership is still reality in Macedonia, on the eve of its own  metamorphosis into private or some other kind of ownership, we  indubitably come to the conclusion that the social property is  the most threatened at this moment. The remolding of the social  capital into private capital reveals numerous hitherto-unknown  forms of economic crime. On the other hand, the methods are  classical -- abuses, bribery, and corruption. Almost overnight,  like mushrooms after rain, new businessmen are appearing --  owners of private or mixed companies who, at the expense of  everybody's or nobody's social ownership, at the expense of the  sleeping and disorganized state, and primarily all at the  expense of the workers who are rapidly approaching the edge of  bare subsistence, make their wealth very quickly.    The Robbery of the Century Continues    As a matter of fact, it is a public secret and a regular  subject of discussion among the common citizens, among those  with a salary or pension of around 100 to 200 German marks a  month, that the state is being robbed blind. For the time  being, there are neither answers nor reactions from those bodies  and services that are there to protect the state. There are no  replies from the legislative or executive bodies that had to  enact and implement the legal basis for preventing the  state-damaging and dangerous events. The most logical  conclusion is that such a situation suits all, particularly  those in power. Except, of course, for the citizen whose bare  existence is put at stake. Thus, the reaction of the common  people is reduced to ordinary gossip about the state or the  ruling power, which, regardless, is continually becoming a  self-serving power. In order not to make this sound like a  radical trade unionist dirge about the difficult fate of the  working people, we shall stick only to the aspect that,  according to the competent state institutions and their  associates, is, especially now, demonstrating such indolence and  indifference, which makes the whole matter look like an  introduction to a kind of totalitarianism.    Parallel to all this, what seen be noticed in Macedonia with  open eyes, conveys to image that the state let go of the reins a  long time ago. It has not just released them, but it is showing  less interest and strength in taking control. It can be seen  that individuals are making money overnight, that taxes are  being avoided, that deals are mostly made in ""cash"" in order to  avoid the financial institutions, that some companies have the  exclusive right to import and export, given to them for their  beauty (confidentially), that speculative liquidations are  taking place, that the social capital is being sold off for next  to nothing....    In such a situation, the rapid polarization of the citizens  is evident, as well as the growing public discontent with the  striking examples of abuse, machination, and speculation, which  finally leads to a certain institutionalization of the crime.    Claims that the state authority bodies are not involved in  such filthy deals are fairy tales. In brief, no matter how  painful it may be, the ancient scheme of connecting the economic  power with the political power is slowly emerging in the  Republic of Macedonia. This also creates the conditions for the  revival of the connection between the criminal climate and the  state establishment, which represents a basic definition of the  phenomenon -- organized crime.

0,FT942-13374 ,"FT942-13374 _AN-EDZEDAACFT 940426   FT  26 APR 94 / Rightwing extremist attacks on S Africa poll feared      By MICHAEL HOLMAN and MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   Rightwing extremists were feared last night to be planning violent attacks targeting polling stations in South Africa's first all-race elections, which start today, after bombers struck again yesterday. Last night a bomb exploded in a black area of Pretoria following a car bombing earlier in the day in Germiston, near Johannesburg, that killed 10 people and injured 36. Police said a number of people could have been killed in the Pretoria bombing, but no casaulty figures were available. Yesterday's attacks brought the number of explosions since Saturday to 13. The Germiston bomb was planted at a rank for minibus taxis used by blacks. Nine people were killed and nearly 100 injured in Sunday's car bomb explosion in central Johannesburg. Security in and around polling stations was being tightened last night after talks between President FW de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader. Although no one has so far claimed responsibility, it seemed likely the country's extreme white right has mounted a campaign to disrupt the three-day poll. Today the elderly and infirm go to the polls, as well as South Africans abroad. The rest of the 22m eligible voters are able to cast their ballots tomorrow and on Thursday. The attacks, which have shattered the optimism that greeted the decision a week ago of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi to take part in the poll, are expected to target the 9,000 polling stations around the country. Shortly before yesterday's attack in Germiston, Mr de Klerk stressed that the election would go ahead. 'We are not going to allow the right wing or anyone else to delay this election,' he said. At the same time, the shift of conservative opinion to the Freedom Front led by retired army general Constand Viljoen, which is taking part in the election, continued yesterday as MPs and town councillors defected from the Conservative party, which is boycotting the poll. The impact of the blasts is hard to determine. Recent research into voter attitude suggested that blacks were more inured to violence than whites, and thus more likely to ignore the risk and cast their vote. Visiting some of the victims of Sunday's blast, Mr Mandela said: 'I am convinced tough measures if applied can bring these people to book. I hope the government acts in a way to remove the impression it is a government of weaklings.' Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela are understood to be close to agreeing an amnesty for perpetrators of past acts of violence, in an attempt to defuse the rightwing threat and reassure white members of the security forces fearful of retribution under an ANC-led government. Bombs have also gone off at the Steynsburg town hall in the eastern Cape, at Bloemhof magistrates' court in western Transvaal, and at a taxi rank in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg. Most of the attacks have been close to polling stations. South African police have offered a R1m (Pounds 185,000) reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. The stock market shrugged off news of the bombings, with the general index finishing up 28 points at 5,068.

The president, Flight- Lieutenant Jerry John  Rawlings, took the salute at the parade. Addressing the  ceremony, President Rawlings restated the commitment of the  government to the cause of the nation.    [Begin Rawlings recording] The government of the progressive  alliance comprising the National Democratic Congress, the  National Convention Party, and the Egle Party, is conscious of  the record of achievements of the revolutionary decade that  brought Ghana out of conditions of despair and hence our  commitment to build on the gains that have been made. In  rededicating ourselves to the task of nation-building today, we  will be guided by the fact that at the end of the day, we will  be judged not by the amount of political rhetoric we would have  generated, but by the concrete and practical achievements we  would have made in improving the quality of life of our people,  especially those in the rural areas.    Countrymen and women, there is a time for political fanfare,  there is a time for elections and there is a time for work --  for nation-building. Over a year has passed since the  presidential and parliamentary elections were held. While some  may already be setting their sights on 1996 and are dreaming  about their ambitions, we must remember that there is a lot of  hard work which needs doing now. No matter our political  persuasions, we must cooperate with each other in ensuring the  peaceful development of our nation. As a government, we  recognize that democracy thrives in an atmosphere of tolerance.  It is for this reason that the government continues to ignore  the various acts of provocation orchestrated by some political  interests. However, those amongst them who might be  contemplating going beyond their ugly noises must take note that  the government has a constitutional responsibility to maintain  law and order. [end recording]    President Rawlings spoke against acts of provocation by some  political interest groups. He also spoke about the need to  foster national unity.    [Begin Rawlings recording] Our individual and collective  loyalties to our families, ethnic groups and political parties  should not be allowed to divide us as a nation. We all have a  responsibility to promote unity, stability, and development and  to be actively involved in resolving situations which militate  against this unity. Countrymen and women, as we commemorate the  fifth anniversary of the inauguration of the Fourth Republic, we  should more than ever before be mindful of the challenges that  lie ahead. And it is only through our collective efforts that we  can build an enduring foundation for national development. In  the year ahead, let us have little less of the unproductive  political rhetorics and a little more concerted and practical  efforts in those areas which directly affect the lives of our  people. Productivity, rural development, export promotion, the  elimination of waste -- these are things which we can all  contribute towards no matter our affiliations or opinions.  These are the things which will make our nation competitive in  the global economic context.    As we celebrate the first anniversary of the Fourth  Republic,  we must thank God for bringing us this far. We must enter the  new year with renewed determination to strengthen the  foundations of national unity, stability, and development.  Noble countrymen and women, I wish to congratulate the  contingents on parade for an excellent drill. I also wish once  again to commend our officers and men in the Armed Forces, the  police, and the security agencies as well as our various  revolutionary organs and supporters for their diligence and  dedication to national unity. I thank you and wish you all,  once again, a happy anniversary and a happy new year. God be  with you. [end recording]     "

As we have learned, President Berisha last evening met  with political party representatives, government members, and  chairmen of various associations to discuss this tragic and  painful event.    [Koleci] The president's press and information office  reports that President Sali Berisha yesterday afternoon  organized a meeting attended by Meksi, Vukaj, Malasi, Serreqi,  [Public Order Minister] Musaraj, [Social Democratic Party  Chairman] Gjinushi, Laco, [Republican Party Chairman] Godo,  Shamata, Hajdaraga, Kola, and [Independent Trade Union Chairman]  Xheka to discuss the massacre that one of the Greek commando  units carried out with premeditation in the early hours of  Sunday [10 April] in the recruiters barracks in Peshkepi e  Siperme, 4 km into Albanian territory.    President Berisha stressed that this act is a real massacre  and an unprecedented violation of Albania's integrity and  sovereignty since 1949. This marks an open hostile act by  Greece against Albania and is a continuation of other  terroristic acts committed by Greek forces, such as the case of  the murder of the shepherd in Devoll and the assault on our  warship in our own waters. All of these -- even though they are  documented -- have been negated by the Greek Government through  dishonest means.    For the past two years, Berisha continued, we have made  intensive efforts to develop cooperation and relations with  Greece. We have tried and will continue to try so that the  Greek minority in Albania and our emigrants in Greece will be a  powerful factor of cooperation and understanding between our two  peoples and countries.    Unfortunately, I would say, for the misfortune of the Greek  Government circles, we have ascertained that the Greek side has  used Albanian emigrants as a means of pressure against Albania,  even openly making calls for its destabilization. Concerning  the minority, attempts have been made to manipulate it and turn  it into an apple of discord for Albania.    Berisha stressed that our policy toward the minority cannot  change because of the absurd stance of the Greek Government and  officials toward Albania. The president continued to say that  the minority is and will be free citizens of Albania. We will  continue our efforts for the expansion of human rights and  freedoms for Albanians and the minority.    Further on, Berisha reconfirmed his determination and that  of  the government to persistently continue the policy of decreasing  the tension and contributing toward peace and stability in the  region, something that is not at all desired by those who are  interested in creating tensions and conflicts.    On the other hand, the Albanian president informed those  present that the government is making all the demarches to  friendly countries and international organizations to condemn  this grave act of terrorism on the part of Greece and ask her to  put an end to this policy by finding and convicting its  culprits. The Albanian Government will take every measure to  counteract terror of any kind and secure its own citizens.    Those present supported the statement by President Berisha  and considered this meeting very useful. They strongly  condemned the ugly and terroristic act against Albania and  supported the constructive policy of the Albanian Government in  the region. They also asked the government to condemn this  terrorist act to the UN Security Council and international  organizations and take all measures to see that such acts are no  longer repeated.    They also asked the Albanian Government to continue to  oppose  the policy of Hellenism in the south of the country and expand  its policy on preserving peace and stability in the region.  Those present at the meeting said that everyone should clearly  understand that when it is a question of the national question,  the Albanians are and will remain a sole voice.     "

No amount  of counseling or love or psychological therapy could have prevented his brutal  acts, as how can you cure a person with no conscience? In fact, contrary to  being abused or deprived, he had all the advantages life could offer: good  looks, a charming personality, a college education, a loving family  environment.

Politicians,  observers, and media analysts consider this summit the most  prominent event of the year given that it may activate the  Middle East peace process and achieve positive, honorable, and  satisfactory results on all tracks.    The fact that 4,000 reporters from all over the world are  flocking to Geneva gives an idea of the attention given by the  world community to this summit and the great aspirations raised  by it. The sincere hope that the results of this summit will be  translated on the ground into a just and comprehensive peace in  the region and into prosperity in the post-peace era. This  large-scale concern over the Syrian-U.S. summit is evidence of  the entire world's yearning to achieve a firm peace in the  Middle East, the principal supporter of which is Syria.    The world community is fully aware that separate deals do  not  achieve peace but increase tension. It is also aware that  Syria's call for a just, comprehensive, and honorable peace  based on Security Council resolutions opens the road toward real  stability in the region.    There is no doubt that the entire world is sick and tired of  Israel's repressive and inhuman acts inside the occupied Arab  territories. These acts worry the human conscience and cause it  to question the purpose behind the international silence over  Israel's serious violations of international principles and laws  and the point behind the super powers' use of double standards.    Israel is imposing a tight siege on the occupied  territories.  The Israeli Army and Zionist settlers are destroying Arab  neighborhoods, scorching property owned by Palestinians, and  killing Palestinians. Moreover, Israel rejects the Security  Council resolutions and insists on occupation and expansion and  on obstructing the peace efforts. All this constitutes a real  threat not only to Middle East peace but to world peace as well,  given the impact the Middle East has throughout the world.    It is worth noting that this world concern focuses on the  need for Israel to submit to the resolutions of international  legitimacy and to frankly announce that the Golan is Syrian  territory, from which Israel should fully withdraw. This is a  sign that Syria's sincere efforts to achieve peace have born  fruit. The world community never cast doubts on the Arab's  intentions, but is casting doubts on Israel's intentions and is  denouncing its intransigent stands. The world community went  beyond this, noting that President al-Asad's stands are  principled stands that cannot be bargained over.    The world's great politicians always take international  public opinion into consideration. International public opinion  demands a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East that  removes the Israeli occupation and restores to the Palestinians  their national legitimate rights, the most important of which is  their right to self-determination.    Certainly, President al-Asad, who has been known as a man of  principle and decisionmaking, will not only represent Syria but  will represent all the Arabs as well. He will be the staunch  defender of the principles of right, justice, and fairness,  without which there can be no peace in the Middle East.    Peace contradicts occupation and occupation contradicts  dignity. A stable and firm peace must be based on justice and  dignity. Justice stipulates the full withdrawal of Israel from  all the occupied Arab territories. Dignity stipulates the  restoration of the Palestinian people right to regain their  freedom and self-determination.    The Arab-Israeli conflict has many important and serious  aspects. These include Israel's withdrawal from the occupied  territories, the Palestinian people's rights, the issues of  refugees, evacuees, displaced people, and deportees. All of  these aspects are collective and their solutions lie in  implementing Security Council resolutions and entrenching the  principles of international law. The success of the summit,  which is important to the entire world, is contingent on its  success in tackling these issues.     "

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is disturbed by the ordination in  San Francisco last week of a lesbian couple and a gay man who will not vow  celibacy. No institution should shrink from controversy and the church is no  exception. Martin Luther's 95 Theses in 1517 marking the beginning of German  Protestantism were greeted with neither mildness nor acceptance.    What is peculiar is that in a church body traditionally and primarily regulated  by elected, ordained pastors, there is widespread concern among the laity on  this issue. Martin Marty, foremost American church historian and a Lutheran  himself, suggests that the majority of Lutheran laity side with the official  church policy -- that practicing homosexuals should not be ordained.    The basis for the policy is that sexual activity should be permitted only  within the traditional marriage bond of women and men. Biblical admonitions are  found in Leviticus in the Old Testament and in Paul's condemnation of  homosexuality in the New Testament. The fact that most contemporary  parishioners agree with the current policy is not surprising, since the  Lutheran Church in the United States has been characterized and influenced by  the conservatism of Northern European immigrants.    But the church's views reflect pervasive and intolerant social mores. Social  judgment and hypocrisy of the kind that Nathaniel Hawthorne described in ""The  Scarlet Letter"" -- centered around a Puritan community that rejected an  otherwise heroic woman for her single act of adultery -- need to be recognized  and avoided by the modern church.    Yet even in my lifetime, the church's code of behavior has become less  judgmental and more accepting. I grew up in a Lutheran parsonage and recall  when I could not attend a theologically innocuous Ma and Pa Kettle movie on  Sundays and had to remove my colored nail polish for the sabbath. I also  remember -- only 15 years ago -- a Midwestern woman of the Missouri Synod  stating that she was showing disrespect to God by not wearing a hat to  services. More significant is the example of a Lutheran pastor 30 years ago who  was defrocked and disallowed from serving in any type of parish role because he  was divorced. Today, such ""improprieties"" are overlooked.    But how long will it take for the church to accept practicing homosexuals among  its clergy?    While its people move -- too slowly -- toward greater tolerance, the  fundamental beliefs of love and brotherhood that the church espouses are  diluted and become less credible. When this wrenching controversy within the  church is resolved, the church can become a stronger force in the world. Here  is an occasion where people can resist harsh and narrow judgment and accept  clergy no matter what their human sexual practices. The church needs to return  to more important concerns of salvation and redemption.    The ordination of practicing homosexuals is not an issue of good and evil, or  really a fundamental theological concern at all. It is an issue of individual  choice and social acceptance, a point most Lutherans refuse to acknowledge.    What the Evangelical Luthern Church in America -- and all Christians -- should  practice is the Greek ideal of koinonia -- unequivocal love of God and fellow  humans. If the church is going to flourish and survive in a modern world,  authentic love needs to extend beyond the bounds of current social mores.

Subpart I_Claims Under Article 139, Uniform Code of Military Justice       536.137       Statutory authority.       The authority for this subpart is Article 139, UCMJ (10 U.S.C. 939), which provides for redress for property willfully damaged or destroyed, or wrongfully taken, by members of the armed forces of the United States.       536.138       Purpose.       This subpart sets forth the standards to be applied and the procedures to be followed in the processing of claims for damage, loss, or destruction of property owned by or in the lawful possession of an individual whether civilian or military, a business, a charity, or a State or local government, where the property was wrongfully taken or willfully damaged by military members of DA. Claims cognizable under other claims statutes may be processed under this subpart.       536.139       Effect of disciplinary action.       Administrative action under Article 139 and this subpart is entirely separate and distinct from disciplinary action taken under other sections of the UCMJ or other administrative actions. Because action under Article 139 and this chapter requires independent findings on issues other than guilt or innocence, the mere fact that a soldier was convicted or acquitted of charges is not dispositive of a claim under Article 139.       536.140       Claims cognizable.       Claims cognizable under Article 139, UCMJ, are limited to_   (a) Claims for property willfully damaged. Willful damage is damage which is inflicted intentionally, knowingly, and purposefully without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from damage caused inadvertently or thoughtlessly through simple or gross negligence. Damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by riotous, violent, or disorderly acts, or by acts of depredation, or through conduct showing reckless or wanton disregard of the property rights of others may be considered willful damage.   (b) Claims for property wrongfully taken. A wrongful taking is any unauthorized taking or withholding of property, not involving the breach of a fiduciary or contractual relationship, with the intent to temporarily or permanently deprive the owner or person lawfully in possession of the property. Damage, loss, or destruction of property through larceny, forgery, embezzlement fraud, misappropriation, or similar offense may be considered wrongful taking.       536.141       Claims not cognizable.       Claims not cognizable under this subpart and Article 139 include_   (a) Claims resulting from negligent acts.   (b) Claims for personal injury or death.   (c) Claims resulting from acts or omissions of military personnel acting within the scope of their employment.   (d) Claims resulting from the conduct of Reserve component personnel who are not subject to the UCMJ at the time of the offense.   (e) Subrogated claims, including claims by insurers.       536.142       Limitations on assessments.       (a) Time Limitations. To be considered, a claim must be submitted within 90 days of the incident out of which the claim arose, unless the special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA) acting on the claim determines that good cause has been shown for the delay.

0,FT932-3637 ,"FT932-3637 _AN-DFMAUAFCFT 930612   FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: A Cave full of treasures      By ANDREW CLEMENTS   The Cave is Steve Reich and Beryl Korot's ambitious, technologically dazzling, theatre piece: three hours of music, video images and computer graphics which gnaw away at our received definitions of what theatre, opera or music theatre ought to be. It received its first performance a month ago in Vienna, moved on to Berlin and then for the first week of the Holland Festival to Amsterdam, where it was presented in the wonderfully flexible space of the Goederenbeurszaal in the old stock exchange building. In August it moves to London for a season at the Royal Festival Hall. The Cave is an exploration of Reich and Korot's Jewish heritage, or more precisely the way in which part of that heritage, the story of Abraham and Sarah and their sons Isaac and Ishmael, is retained and shared in the memories of present-day Israelis, Palestinians and New Yorkers. The basis of each of the three acts is a set of video interviews with prominent citizens in West and East Jerusalem, and in New York; the images and the speech provide the starting point for both Reich's music and Korot's visual collages, as details of both are taken up and used as the jumping-off points for detailed development. Both sets of processes are fascinatingly worked out, and neatly complementary; as the talking heads are projected on to one or more of the five video screens that dominate the 'set' for The Cave, decorative details from the images may be shown alongside them or computer-generated texts reeled off in parallel in French, German, English or Arabic. Meanwhile the performers - four singers and the 13 instrumentalists of the Steve Reich Ensemble (conducted by Paul Hillier) - take up words, phrases, speech rhythms or pitch collections from the video voices and weave around them commentary and accompaniment. The music produced is characteristic of recent Reich: Different Trains, the string quartet he wrote for the Kronos Quartet and which also used archive interviews, is the most obvious point of reference. The score is muscular, intricately worked, carefully judged. Each of the first two acts kicks off from the respective Jewish and Islamic responses to a set of questions that begins with 'Who is Abraham?' and 'Who is Sarah?'. 'Abraham for me is my ancestor' offers the first interviewee; 'Ibrahim was neither Jew nor Christian, but a Muslim' asserts a Palestinian in the second act. Both sets of responses are underpinned by the sound of the string quartet, though when in both codas the focus changes and the screens offer a travelogue showing Jerusalem and Hebron today, keyboards begin to colour the sound world. The third act is altogether tighter and more colourful as the American responses set up all kinds of allusions - 'Abraham Lincoln High School, high on the hill midst sand and sea, that's as far's I trace Abraham', admits Richard Serra. The whole ensemble is brought in, and the musical climax is reached with a retelling of the story of Abraham and Isaac, when the music darkens and becomes overtly expressive. The ending is abrupt, matter of fact. Reich and Korot have invented a richly woven tapestry, novel in its presentation, delicately balanced in the issues it raises. There are no overt political messages, but the historical undertow is inevitable in the first two acts - 'The Cave' of the title is the place in which Abraham and the patriarchs are reputed to be buried; it is now the site of a mosque. And the sense of the US as hermetically sealed, cut off from that bundle of racial and religious issues half way across the world, is tellingly conveyed in the third. The third act, indeed, just over half an hour long, is a bracing and thrilling creation, fast-paced and full of wonderful visual and musical invention. The first two acts, though, are too long, especially the opening one, which takes 65 minutes to lay down the biblical background, and set up the compositional techniques. With insufficient contrast of approach between Acts 1 and 2, only (only]) the change of religious emphasis, the cumulative musical impression is too diffuse; the audience has cottoned on to the use of the video images and the computer keyboards rapping out text. Yet so much about the concept of The Cave is thoughtful and fresh that one almost forgives its longueurs. Reich has sought out a genuinely new synthesis of sound and image. By the third act he and Korot are making it work, and that final half an hour more than justifies his faith and the audience's patience. Performances of The Cave at the Royal Festival Hall, London run from August 18 to 23.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P7922 Theatrical Producers and Services.

According to the service's preliminary conclusions,  state-run  stations are given priority in using transmitters and  rebroadcasting lines, they are subsidized from the state budget,  while private stations can rent equipment only by way of contest  and can earn money only by selling commercial time.    Besides, state TV and radio charges considerably less for  commercial time and thus limits the ability of private stations  to compete on the market.    The competition service intends to submit its final  conclusions to the parliament and the government when additional  information about the situation on the TV and radio market is  obtained. Supposedly, state TV and radio will have to reduce its  commercial time, while the government will be recommended to  take into account the income for commercials when allocating  subsidies to state-run stations.

The study, based on Massachusetts data gathered a decade ago, found that such  harm is relatively common, especially among city dwellers and poor people.    Overall, 85% of the intentional injuries resulted from assaults, such as  fights, rape and battering.    The analysis was conducted by Dr. Bernard Guyer and colleagues from Harvard  School of Public Health and Boston University School of Medicine. It was  conducted in 1979 to 1982 in 14 Massachusetts communities and published in the  New England Journal of Medicine.

The study, based on Massachusetts data gathered a decade ago, found that such  harm is relatively common, especially among city dwellers and poor people.    Overall, 85% of the intentional injuries resulted from assaults, such as  fights, rape and battering.    The analysis was conducted by Dr. Bernard Guyer and colleagues from Harvard  School of Public Health and Boston University School of Medicine. It was  conducted in 1979 to 1982 in 14 Massachusetts communities and published in the  New England Journal of Medicine.

His crusade achieved an important victory Saturday when President Bush signed  legislation paving the way for the television industry to set standards on  violent programming.    The new law, contained inside unrelated legislation, is an unusual measure. For  one thing, it does not require TV programmers to take any action. Instead, it  simply grants the networks and other broadcasters and cable operators immunity  from federal antitrust prosecution should they decide to meet and discuss the  issue of violence on television.    But despite years of discussion, public hearings and research about the issue,  no one is quite sure whether broadcasters will respond to Congress'  not-so-subtle hint, or indeed, whether the law will have any effect at all.    ""It is a well-intentioned effort on Congress' part,"" said Martin Franks, a CBS  vice president in Washington. ""But this is a problem that is not easily  solved.""    Public watchdog groups say that while the three major television networks have  somewhat lowered the level of violence in prime time in recent years,  television is still twice as violent now as it was only 10 years ago.    Brian Sullivan of the National Coalition on Television Violence said that  prime-time programming averaged 9 to 10 violent acts per hour in the 1989-90  season, up from 4 to 5 violent acts in the 1980-81 season.    Researchers differ over whether watching violence on television is harmful to  viewers, either adults or children. Some studies have suggested that for  viewers who are ""vulnerable,"" watching violence on television may stimulate  violent behavior or have other undesirable results. A task force of the  American Psychological Assn. is drafting a report that concludes that ""viewing  violence on television is causally associated with increases in aggressive  attitudes and aggressive values and behavior.""    The television networks and the American Civil Liberties Union insist, however,  that the research is equivocal.    Simon has no doubt. ""There is no question about the harm.

The television industry has been uncertain about how to respond to Simon's  legislation. Caught in a bind between serving the public interest and heeding  competitive and First Amendment impulses, industry organizations have neither  supported nor opposed his bill and largely have been noncommittal about what  they would do once enacted.    The Simon bill ""is clearly offensive to the spirit of the First Amendment,""  Barry W. Lynn, legislative counsel for the ACLU, said in testimony before  Congress this summer.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others        No written comments were either solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.        III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action        The Amex has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act.    The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act 9  in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, regarding the proposed amendments to Section 107A of the Guide, the Commission believes that the proposal will provide the Amex with added flexibility to list and trade hybrid securities, which may benefit investors by providing additional investment and hedging opportunities, as well as benefitting issuers who offer hybrid securities as a means of raising capital. Additionally, the proposed changes to Section 107A of the Guide will conform Amex's rules regarding the listing of hybrid securities to those already approved for the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The NYSE's hybrid listing rules do not contain a minimum holder requirement for hybrid issues traded in thousand dollar denominations on the Exchange's bond floor. Additionally, Section 703.19 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual provides that an issue of a hybrid security must have a minimum market value at issuance of $4 million.          9     15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1982).         The Commission also believes that the proposed amendments to Section 107B of the Guide are consistent with the Act. Specifically, the proposal to amend 107B provide that ELNs may be linked to non-convertible preferred stock, in addition to common stock, will conform Amex's rules to those approved by the Commission for the listing and trading of Equity-Linked Debt Securities (``ELDS'') on the NYSE. 10           10         See     Section 703.21 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.         With respect to the remaining amendments to Section 107B, the Commission believes that the proposed changes do not raise any significant regulatory issues that were not addressed in the Commission's prior approval orders regarding ELNs. 11  The Commission finds that the proposal to add an additional market capitalization and trading volume requirement for eligible linked securities will expand the number of securities that can be linked to ELNs while maintaining the requirement that the linked security be an actively traded common stock or sponsored ADR issued by a highly capitalized issuer. While the proposal introduces a third alternative for ELN eligibility that reduces the minimum market capitalization requirement for the linked security, the stock of such an issuer (or sponsored ADR related thereto) could only be linked to an ELN issue if its trading volume in the U.S. for the prior one-year period is at least 80 million shares, which is four times higher than the current minimum trading volume requirement. 12  The Commission believes that together, the new capitalization and trading volume requirements will continue to ensure that ELNs are only issued on highly liquid securities of broadly capitalized companies and that these requirements will reduce the likelihood of any adverse market impact on the securities underlying ELNs.          11         See supra     note 3.           12         See supra     note 4.

Instead of  concentrating on the 240,000 barrels of crude that escaped the tanker, the real  story was how Exxon and the government saved another 1 million barrels from  escaping into the sea. Sununu is quoted in Time as saying, ""Three-quarters of  it was contained within the ship. There's been very little reporting on that.""    It so happens that Sununu is right. I wrote that story soon after the Exxon  Valdez hit the rocks but nobody would print it.    So here it is again:    There was a miracle in Prince William Sound yesterday when one of the largest  oil tankers in the world went aground and ruptured on the rocks near the Port  of Valdez. Only 240,000 barrels of crude oil escaped from its tanks before  valiant Exxon damage-control people managed to pump oil into another tanker.    An oil-spill expert said that barely 800 miles of shoreline would be affected  by the spill, as opposed to the entire West Coast of the United States, if  everyone had not been so on the ball.    He told reporters, ""You have here an example of how the combination of  seamanship and teamwork was able to turn what could have been a major disaster  into a piddling incident. All credit goes to the captain of the Exxon Valdez.  Even though he had been in his cabin, he decided to go out on deck after the  accident and save his ship. A grateful nation owes him a debt for salvaging 1  million barrels of much-needed fuel.""    When asked if anyone was to blame for the spill, the expert replied, ""Only if  the press insists on writing stories about the oil lost to the sea instead of  what is now safely inside the tanker. If the media want to be fair they should  focus on how many birds and otters are still alive because 1 million barrels of  oil were not spilled. As long as the TV cameras keep filming oil-soaked geese,  the true story of the heroic Valdez will never be told.""    One TV reporter said, ""What about the oil on the beaches? Is it all right to  concentrate on that?""    ""Why don't you show pictures of the black gold that was pumped off the Exxon  Valdez? You don't help people feel any better by always illustrating the  downside of what happens when a tanker runs aground. Everybody makes mistakes,  but there is absolutely no reason to draw attention to them with pictures of  workers wiping off rocks with damp towels.""    According to the expert, no one is sure how long it will take for the oil spill  carnage to be cleaned up. However, everyone is pleased with the smoothness of  the operation, especially when compared with how long it would have taken if  all the oil on board had leaked.    The expert continued, ""It's true that it looks bad from the air, but that's  just because oil and water don't mix. All of us would have preferred not to  have had an accident, but if there is one and only 25% of your cargo is lost,  anyone can live with that.""    He was then asked, ""Knowing what you know now, is there anything we can do to  make this a kinder, gentler Alaska?""    ""It's no good dwelling on incidents such as oil spills. You have to look at a  grounded tanker as you do a glass of water, and ask yourself if it's half full  or half empty. That's what oil spills are all about.""

He told reporters, ""You have here an example of how the combination of  seamanship and teamwork was able to turn what could have been a major disaster  into a piddling incident. All credit goes to the captain of the Exxon Valdez.  Even though he had been in his cabin, he decided to go out on deck after the  accident and save his ship. A grateful nation owes him a debt for salvaging 1  million barrels of much-needed fuel.""    When asked if anyone was to blame for the spill, the expert replied, ""Only if  the press insists on writing stories about the oil lost to the sea instead of  what is now safely inside the tanker. If the media want to be fair they should  focus on how many birds and otters are still alive because 1 million barrels of  oil were not spilled. As long as the TV cameras keep filming oil-soaked geese,  the true story of the heroic Valdez will never be told.""    One TV reporter said, ""What about the oil on the beaches? Is it all right to  concentrate on that?""    ""Why don't you show pictures of the black gold that was pumped off the Exxon  Valdez? You don't help people feel any better by always illustrating the  downside of what happens when a tanker runs aground. Everybody makes mistakes,  but there is absolutely no reason to draw attention to them with pictures of  workers wiping off rocks with damp towels.""    According to the expert, no one is sure how long it will take for the oil spill  carnage to be cleaned up. However, everyone is pleased with the smoothness of  the operation, especially when compared with how long it would have taken if  all the oil on board had leaked.    The expert continued, ""It's true that it looks bad from the air, but that's  just because oil and water don't mix. All of us would have preferred not to  have had an accident, but if there is one and only 25% of your cargo is lost,  anyone can live with that.""    He was then asked, ""Knowing what you know now, is there anything we can do to  make this a kinder, gentler Alaska?""    ""It's no good dwelling on incidents such as oil spills. You have to look at a  grounded tanker as you do a glass of water, and ask yourself if it's half full  or half empty. That's what oil spills are all about.""      Column    "

More than 5,000 people were thrown out  of their homes illegally by Croatian security forces during 1992  and 1993, many of them beaten, threatened and robbed in the  process, it said in a report released Tuesday [22 March].  ""Despite assurances (...) forced and illegal expulsions, acts of  violence and the absence of all protection for their victims  continues in Croatia,"" it commented.    The report gave details of 21 cases, including one where the  victim died, and criticised Croatia for not keeping a promise  made in December to open inquiries on the many complaints  brought to the authorities. The victims were Croat citizens or  long-standing residents of non-Croat origin, mostly Serb, who  lived in homes built by the former federal Yugoslav army for  veterans and their families.    Since Croatian independence in 1991, the homes have been  under the control of the Ministry of Defence.     "

Li Lanqing, member of  the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice  premier of the State Council, Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of  the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and  Wan Guoquan, vice chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, met with 207  representatives and took a group photo with them.    While meeting with the representatives, Li Lanqing said: I  am very happy to meet with advanced representatives of  individual workers and let me extend congratulations to all who  have won this honor. As all people know that the socialist  market economy is composed of various economic sectors with  public ownership as the mainstay, and they are competing with  one another at an equal footing, promoting one another, and  seeking common development. This is a long-term national policy.  During the past few years, the individual and private economies  were filled with vigor and vitality. This achievement should be  attributed first to the party's open policy, and second, to the  painstaking and pioneering spirit and hard work of the  individual workers. They have played an important role in  promoting economic development, which is obvious to all. It is  hoped that all of you will do business in line with law, rely on  your honest labor and management ability to develop your own  undertakings, and contribute to China's economic development.  It is also hoped that all of you will not forget the virtue of  the Chinese people, which means that one should not forget other  people when become rich and that one should lead the local  people to reach common prosperity. Meanwhile, it is also  necessary to promote the spirit of feeling happy to help other  people. For example, the activities to donate funds to support  education should be conducted.    Li Lanqing said: Among the individual workers, many heroic  models have emerged in addition to the emergence of a batch of  outstanding entrepreneurs. Among the representatives present at  this rally, one individual worker from Zhejiang was injured  during a fire fighting. His deed is very touching. It is hoped  that all of you will promote the spirit of being ready to take  up the cudgels for a just cause, make common efforts, enable our  economy to further develop, and achieve good results in building  spiritual civilization.    In his speech, Wang Bingqian said: The development of the  individual and private economies has played an increasingly  noticeable role in promoting production, enlivening the economy,  making the market brisk, invigorating circulation, making things  convenient for living, expanding employment, and safeguarding  social stability. At present, there are more than 17.6 million  individual industrial and commercial units across the country  with more than 29 million employees. This is an important force  which can never be dispensable with in China's socialist  construction cause. The undertakings engaged in by the  individual workers are glorious, and are protected by the state  law, which should be acknowledged by society and respected by  the people.    This commendatory activity is co-sponsored by the Central  Committee of the Communist Youth League, the State Industrial  and Commercial Administrative Bureau, and the China Association  of Individual Workers.

This follows the arrest over the past week of three policeman, two of them brothers, stationed in Bologna and the Emilia Romagna region. All three are believed to be linked to some 15 unexplained killings and a series of violent robberies dating back to 1988. A pistol found in the possession of one of the arrested policeman has been matched by firearms experts to the killing of a carabiniere and the murder of a prison educationalist. Police are now checking whether the group was protected within the service and allowed to carry out activities to destabilise Emilia Romagna, the region controlled by the former Communist party.

Meanwhile, it has  encouraged several countries in Europe to close down the Kurdish  organizations in them. A widespread view behind the political  scenes in Turkey is that Germany expects Turkey to reciprocate.    [Kinkel] No, expecting something in return from Turkey is  out  of the question. I have always wanted to have the PKK  activities banned. I am glad that that has been done now. The  legal requirements for and the possible outcome of the banning  of associations in Germany, which is governed on the basis of a  liberal constitution, have to be debated in detail. That is  essential. The significant wave of agitation throughout Germany  on 4 November should have convinced everyone that remaining  inactive against the militant Kurdish groups, which wanted to  achieve their objective through violence, was no longer  possible. They posed a threat to Germany's security and public  order. They also posed a threat to peaceful coexistence in  Germany. We cannot allow the internal disputes in Turkey to be  transferred to our country. Nor do we wish to allow that to  happen. We respect the rights of the Turkish citizens in  Germany. However, we must not be expected to adopt an  understanding approach on acts of violence. [passage omitted]    [Minareci] How does Germany plan to prevent the PKK from  violating the ban and establishing new organizations under  different names? Can you comment on how the PKK will behave in  Germany in the future? What are the measures the German  Government plans to put into effect against possible PKK attacks  in the future?    [Kinkel] The Federal Internal Affairs Minister's decision  not  only bans the PKK and the 34 organizations affiliated with it  but also prohibits any move to establish new organizations to  replace them. Naturally, the police and the judicial organs  will see to it that the ban is imposed within the framework of  the laws. They will bring criminal charges against anyone who  violates Germany's laws.    [Minareci] While the European Union [EU] members have moved  to cooperate against the PKK, Greece has openly supported that  terrorist organization. Will Germany hold talks with Greece on  that matter?    [Kinkel] The PKK problem has not affected all the EU members  as much as it has affected Germany. However, all the EU  countries agree on the need to condemn terrorism and wage a  determined struggle against it. In view of that, Germany is  acting together with all the other EU members in a coordinated  way. We hope to establish closer cooperation on the matter.    [Minareci] In addition to the PKK, other terrorist groups  and  individuals have used Germany as their headquarters, such as  Dev-Yol [Revolutionary Path Organization] and Cemalettin Kaplan  [Islamic fundamentalist leader]. Will Germany take measures  against them as well or will they find an opportunity to  strengthen their ranks?    [Kinkel] The ban on associations is not the only effective  measure that can be taken in the struggle against terrorist  activities. Germany is a lawful state which can use various  means to wage a struggle against anyone who resorts to acts of  violence and disrupts law and order and peace. The Dev-Sol  [Revolutionary Left Organization] was banned in Germany in 1983.  The PKK has been banned recently. The pertinent federal state  has taken measures against Cemalettin Kaplan within the  framework of the law on foreigners. I suggest that matters  concerning the two countries should not be viewed from the point  of view of the adoption of forceful measures. Political  arguments and debates have gained importance in our time, more  so than before. They must be based on the friendship between  Turkey and Germany, the concept of human and citizenship rights  within the framework of the European and Atlantic organizations,  and the concept of freedom and democracy.

Mr Andrew Kimmins admitted two charges of fraudulent trading. They stated that between November 1986 and December 1988 he was knowingly party to the carrying on of the businesses of Blade Securities and Blade Investments, both of Brompton Road, London, with intent to defraud creditors. Another 23 charges were left on the court file. He will be sentenced later. The two companies have been wound up with combined debts of Pounds 2.9m. Mr James Curtis, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, said Mr Kimmins had obtained Financial Services Act authorisation for Blade Investments from the Securities Association and the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers by making inaccurate declarations about Blade Investments' capital and funding. He had omitted the fact that it was assuming substantial debts of Blade Securities, which was insolvent. Blade Investments traded for eight months before being served with preventive orders by the regulatory bodies in December 1988. Mr Curtis said the prosecution accepted that Mr Kimmins had set up the business honestly and tried to run it as a genuine business venture. His business practices had, however, been inappropriate and unprofessional. By the end of 1986 Blade Securities was being run negligently. From mid 1987, when Mr Kimmins had been aware the position was worsening, he had become reckless in handling existing company obligations and incurring new ones. Mr Curtis said: 'In late 1987, when the position was irretrievable and both companies insolvent, Kimmins resorted to specific acts of misuse of clients' money or stockholdings, albeit for the purposes of the business.' The prosecution accepted this had been done in the hope of rescue. No rescue had come, though Mr Kimmins maintained that well into 1989 he had treated the rescue proposal as realistic and been led to believe that others did also. He had persisted in commercially unsatisfactory settlement practices, caused clients' holdings to become depleted and incurred heavy bank debts, Mr Curtis said. Instead of using clients' money to buy shares, he had applied it for other purposes, such as security for trading debts, while maintaining the pretence of having carried out clients' instructions. Late in 1988 he carried out a series of acts of fraudulent trading in relation to a Standard Chartered rights issue.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

Greetings  on the coming new year 1994! Today is the Day of Solidarity of  Azeris throughout the world. I greet the Azeris throughout the  world on this momentous day and wish for them to cooperate even  more closely in the future!    The year 1993, which is drawing to an end, has been a  difficult one for the Azeri people, for our republic. Complex  sociopolitical processes have evolved in the life of the  Republic of Azerbaijan this year; certain changes have occurred.  The war that has resulted from aggression by the Armenian Armed  Forces has continued; some of our lands have been occupied; many  citizens of Azerbaijan have been forced to leave the locations  of their permanent residence and become refugees. This year, the  Republic of Azerbaijan has been going through a profound  economic and social crisis. We may say with complete confidence  and a feeling of tremendous pride that our people and our  republic have come out of these difficulties and trials  worthily, and are looking to the year 1994 with confidence.    The year 1993 has been marked by complex collisions in the  socioeconomic life of the republic. A confrontation between  various groups and the striving of separatist forces to  dismember Azerbaijan have disrupted sociopolitical stability in  the republic, which by the middle of the year ended up on the  very brink--at the threshold of a civil war. We might say that a  civil war has already started, that the blood of brethren has  been shed in some regions of Azerbaijan, which has worsened  tensions within the republic. However, the people have once  again displayed their wisdom, and prevented a civil war. The  confrontation has been eliminated, and the separatist forces  endeavoring to dismember Azerbaijan have been neutralized. By  now, our republic is already solving its problems under stable  and quiet conditions.    This year, our republic has tried to stop the onslaught of  the Armenian Armed Forces. Unfortunately, we have suffered  defeats, and some territories have been lost. Our citizens who  have become refugees as a result of the occupation of  Azerbaijani lands by the Armenian Armed Forces have been  resettled in other regions of the republic. At present, there  are more than 1 million refugees in Azerbaijan. This has  produced extreme tensions in the position of Azerbaijan as a  whole, and in particular in the situation within the republic.    However, it should be noted that the situation has now  changed. In recent months, we have witnessed major changes,  which have resulted from the efforts made to raise an army in  the republic, strengthen discipline in it, and securely protect  our lands. The units of the Army of Azerbaijan, our heroic  warriors are now securely protecting our territories, displaying  exemplary heroism, worthily responding to attacks by the  Armenian Armed Forces, and striking blows at that. We can say  with a feeling of satisfaction that in recent months, all  attempts by Armenian Armed Forces have been defeated; their  offensives have been turned back. The Armed Forces of our  republic are securely defending the positions taken by them and  are proving to the Armenian Armed Forces the degree to which the  force and might of the Republic of Azerbaijan have increased.    At present, heavy fighting is under way on all fronts,  through the fault of the Armenian Armed Forces. We have said  repeatedly, and I will repeat again, that our state comes out in  favor of a peaceful withdrawal from this war, from the woes that  have befallen Azerbaijan. We have taken several steps in this  direction, and today we are proclaiming our position again. I  think that these steps of ours should produce results. At the  same time, the Republic of Azerbaijan has already been able to  boost its military might, and our people may be completely  confident that the Army of Azerbaijan will be able to take the  necessary measures to ensure the secure defense of the republic  and to regain the occupied lands in the future, too.    War goes on, fighting goes on, and our people suffer losses.  This is natural. Today, just as in the beginning of the year,  the valiant sons of the Azeri people become martyrs and die as  they defend our lands in front-line regions. Today, on the eve  of this holiday, I express my condolences to the families,  relatives, and loved ones of the fallen. I admire the courage of  the heroic sons of Azerbaijan. May Allah bless all those who  have sacrificed themselves, and may their graves be filled with  light [the previous sentence is rendered in Azeri in the  original]. May Allah grant patience to their families.    I think that our people are capable of enduring these severe  trials. At present, on this holiday, I send my holiday greetings  to soldiers and officers and all our citizens who are  steadfastly and heroically fighting at the front; I greet them  on the occasion of New Year's day. I wish them health and  success in doing their sacred duty.    The war has borne bitter fruits, and it is still bearing  them. The number of refugees has increased as a result of the  aggression of the Armenian Armed Forces. As I address the  refugees, the esteemed citizens of Azerbaijan, I send my  greetings on the occasion of New Year's day. Indeed, it is the  tradition of our people for each citizen to mark the New Year  holiday in his own home, at the native hearth. Unfortunately, a  majority of our citizens have lost warm shelter, houses, and  hearths, and have been put up in various rayons. However, the  refugees, wherever they might be, should know that our people  care for them deeply, and the state looks after them. No matter  how sad they are and what hardships they are experiencing, I  wish them to be in a holiday mood today.    Our republic is going through a difficult crisis. The  socioeconomic crisis is associated, on one hand, with the war  that has been going on for about six years, and on the other  hand, it has been due to certain objective and subjective  causes. All of these were the reasons for a decline in the  welfare of our people, who are now in a difficult situation.  However, we know that our people are patient, and that they will  endure these difficulties, too. The distressing year 1993 will  end, and in 1994 a turnaround will occur in the development of  our economy; the welfare of the people will improve with every  passing day.    Today, on the Day of Solidarity of Azeris throughout the  world, I wish all Azeris to have unity and solidarity. The  solidarity of Azeris on the territory of the independent  Republic of Azerbaijan is needed to this end first of all. The  second year of independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan is now  ending. This is not too long a period of time. These two years  have been a difficult time for our republic. We are proceeding  toward a third anniversary of our independence. We are facing  great tasks, to accomplish which our people and the Republic of  Azerbaijan will need unity and solidarity of all citizens. If  all of our citizens, all Azeris residing in our republic, manage  to create a genuine atmosphere of accord, we will be able to  achieve unity among Azeris throughout the world.    This is why I appeal to our people for solidarity, I appeal  for patience. I would like to assure you that the coming year  1994 will be a year of great changes and great accomplishments  for the Republic of Azerbaijan. I repeat: We are now securely  protecting our Motherland, our lands. We strive to lead  Azerbaijan out of the state of war, to put an end to this war,  withdraw from it in a peaceful manner. We have taken a multitude  of steps to this end, and we will take them in the future. On 20  December, in Paris, I signed the Paris Charter on behalf of the  Azeri people. We have thus demonstrated yet again to the entire  world the adherence of the Republic of Azerbaijan to peace,  tranquility, and security.    We are supporters of peace. However, along with this we  reinforce our defense forces and strive, and will continue to  strive, to ensure the recovery of the occupied lands of  Azerbaijan. Our people can be sure that all measures will be  taken to ensure the territorial integrity of the Republic of  Azerbaijan and the inviolability of our borders.    You, dear citizens, dear brothers and sisters, may be  certain  that in 1994 our occupied lands will be recovered at any price.  The refugees will return to their homes, to their dwellings. The  territorial integrity and state sovereignty of the Republic of  Azerbaijan will be fully upheld.    Once again, I greet all of you on the occasion of New Year's  day. I wish all citizens of Azerbaijan to have peace,  tranquility, prosperity, happiness in personal life, and success  in all of your endeavors.    Good bye! Happy New Year!     "

While jurors said Monday that Harbor Convalescent Hospital was negligent in  permitting the youngster to wander unattended down its hallways, they also  found that the negligence was not directly to blame for the confrontation with  the mentally disturbed patient or for the severe psychological trauma that the  youngster, now 12, has reportedly suffered.    Several jurors said after the verdict that they believed Faith of Our Fathers  Church in Torrance and two church members were responsible for the boy's  welfare. The jurors also said they vindicated the hospital because they  believed witnesses who testified that the boy had psychological problems before  the incident.      Emotional Trial    The verdict was reached after an emotional seven-week trial and four days of  deliberations.    Ray Moore, a lawyer for the hospital, praised the verdict. But the 39-year-old  mother who filed the lawsuit five years ago on behalf of her son said the  result was ""unbelievable"" and ""unacceptable.""    The mother said she was not concerned with winning a large cash settlement but  rather in receiving a verdict affirming the hospital's responsibility. ""My son  was violated and there was no justice,"" she said.    But the mother and son, who now live in Huntington Beach, will not walk away  without compensation.    Midway through the trial, the church was dropped as a defendant when it agreed  to pay a $1-million settlement without admitting that it was liable for the  boy's injuries. The mother said that at least $350,000 of the settlement will  go to her attorney, Richard Farnell, and to cover court costs.    Jurors said the eleventh-hour settlement may have saved the church, now called  the Living Word Fellowship, from an even larger loss.      Church Cited    ""Too bad the church settled, because we would have nailed the church,"" said  jury foreman Linda De Silva. ""The church had no credibility to us. . . . It was  definitely the church that caused all of this,"" she said. ""They were definitely  responsible.""    Before the settlement, church lawyer Tony Serritella had argued that the  Torrance congregation could not be held liable because the hospital prayer  meeting was the personal ministry of two parishioners and not a  church-sanctioned event.    Jurors had heard testimony that the 6-year-old became restless halfway through  the prayer meeting on Jan. 22, 1984, and wandered down a hospital corridor  where Alfred Ray Hatch -- a toothless, bearded man with open sores on his legs  -- lured him into a treatment room.    A Sheriff's Department report says Hatch admitted that he molested the boy and  forced the boy to perform sex acts on him. Hatch was charged with oral  copulation and performing lewd acts with a child but did not have to stand  trial because he was declared incompetent and was committed to a state mental  hospital.      Suicide Attempts    The boy's attorney, Farnell, had argued that the hospital was liable for the  attack because it failed to properly supervise Hatch or the boy. The boy's  mother testified that in the past five years, he has been depressed and anxious  and has tried to commit suicide 10 times.    Moore countered that the hospital provided as much security as it could without  turning the hospital into a prison. He also attempted to show that the boy had  psychological problems before his encounter with Hatch and that his mother  impeded his recovery by not following medication and therapy instructions.    Moore's arguments and the jury's own focus of blame on the church led to the  victory for the hospital, the jurors said.    ""It was unanimous that the boy was injured and that it was a criminal assault,""  said one juror, who asked not to be named. ""The church should have kept track  of the boy. That was their responsibility.""    Farnell said he has not yet decided whether to file an appeal.

By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CAIRO      A Palestinian gunman, shouting slogans of revenge on behalf of the ""Gaza  martyrs,"" opened fire Monday on a busload of French tourists in Jordan,  spraying them with bullets before pulling out a dagger and stabbing two  passengers cowering behind the front seats.    Nine tourists and a Jordanian photographer were injured in the mid-morning  attack in downtown Amman, which security officials said was to avenge the  killing of seven Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip by an  Israeli near Tel Aviv a day earlier.    ""Where are you, Gazans?"" the gunman yelled as he boarded the bus, according to  witnesses, and at one point during the attack referred to the ""Gaza martyrs.""    Within minutes of the attack, police arrested the man, identified as Ahmad  Badwan, 28, a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip currently residing in Amman.    French Embassy officials said five of the injured tourists were treated and  immediately released. Four others, including a 55-year-old Parisian listed in  critical condition, were hospitalized. A 30-year-old Jordanian photographer  accompanying the tour group was listed in stable condition with gunshot wounds  to both hands.

""The  Jordanian government expresses its deep regret and strong denunciation of this  criminal act and wishes to assure everyone that justice will take its course  and that such acts will be dealt with with utmost stringency.""    The attack came amid heightened tension all over the region after the Sunday  shootings near Tel Aviv by an Israeli.    In Amman, thousands of protesters chanting anti-American slogans and waving the  Koran, the holy book of Islam, marched near the U.S. Embassy, wire services  reported. Some hurled rocks at police, who fired tear gas and used armored cars  to seal off the street where the embassy is located.    Also, protesters at a Palestinian refugee camp near Amman closed the  Amman-Damascus highway Sunday night by throwing stones at passing vehicles, and  at least 20,000 Palestinians staged a demonstration northwest of the Jordanian  capital Monday, chanting ""No to Arab Silence!"" Thousands more Palestinian  refugees demonstrated at camps in Lebanon.    In Cairo, Egypt's fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood denounced an impending  visit to Cairo by Israeli Labor Party leader Shimon Peres and criticized  Egypt's conciliatory stance toward Israel.    At a news conference in Amman, Yassir Abed Rabbo, a senior Palestine Liberation  Organization official, condemned the attack against the French tourists, saying  it provided cover for Israeli actions against Palestinians.    ""We condemn all acts of violence against civilians and believe this was a  suspect attack aimed at covering up Israeli actions in the occupied territories  and diverting attention from what is happening there,"" he said.    The 46-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, in a statement issued  from its headquarters in Jidda, Saudia Arabia, said Sunday's shootings by the  Israeli were part of a ""world Zionist plan and deceitful conspiracy aimed at  terrorizing the Palestinians and forcing them to leave their country for the  benefit of hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jewish emigrants (arriving) with the  view of building a Greater Israel.""

The FTC is given authority to indict and criminally  prosecute  acts which violate the Antimonopoly Law. The chairman and four  commission members, like the public prosecutor's office and  judges, are guaranteed the authority to independently perform  their duties.    Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura's request that  the FTC overlook indictment of the ""dango"" incident by the  Saitama Doyokai was tantamount to demanding a change by the  court prior to its decision. This is quite difficult to  comprehend.    In addition, it has been clarified that former Prime  Minister  Miyazawa relayed former LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] Vice  President Kanemaru's wish to ""forego indictment"" to former FTC  Umezawa. He cannot escape criticism for indiscretion.    The responsibility of politicians will eventually be  clarified. The problem is that politicians had the understanding  that ""the policy of the FTC could be changed by applying  pressure.""    The FTC's posture in seeking the understanding and  cooperation of politicians--particularly of the ruling parties'  Dietmen--on budget acquisition and reform of laws is, as in the  case of the other agencies, inevitable in some aspects. However,  if a relationship of indebtedness arises with an inclination to  comply with demands, it is simply out of the question.    The FTC should take this opportunity for a complete  reexamination of past antimonopoly administration. It is  necessary to check whether it has permitted political  intervention, or whether it has lacked the integrity to reject  pressures when there were doubtful moves. Unless it does so,  suspicion concerning the FTC's autonomy cannot be eradicated.    When former Chairman Umezawa dropped the idea of criminal  indictment, he stated that ""it was totally based on a lack of  evidence"" and denied any pressures from politicians. If it was  based on close consultation with the public prosecutors office,  we would like to believe at the present that it was a proper  judgment.    However, if the arrest of former Construction Minister  Nakamura was in fact based on suspicion, it would mean that he  had lied about the intervention by politicians. Umezawa himself  should clarify when and how the former construction minister  applied pressure and whether there were other approaches made.    It is well known that the FTC is a ""legacy"" left by the  postwar U.S. Occupation policy. Subsequently, emasculation of  the Antimonopoly Law has consistently been contrived.    However, a reinforcement of the FTC has been demanded  through  the Japan-U.S. talks. The government is faced with the need to  promote competitive measures based on the Antimonopoly Law in  order to set forth a posture of emphasis on the consumers. The  role of the FTC has grown unprecedentedly.    To meet the expectations of the people, the FTC must adopt a  consistent posture to avoid the impression that its application  of the Antimonopoly Law is arbitrary and discriminatory.    There is said to be a considerable variation in the  interpretation of the Antimonoply Law among experts. It is  therefore important to display clear-cut judgment. If its  application varies according to acts of violation, credibility  regarding antimonopoly administration will not only be shaken,  but also political intervention will be permitted to pass  through the cracks.    There is also a problem with the present FTC system. In  recent years, the chair has been occupied by former Treasury  Ministry officials. The remaining four commission seats have all  been occupied by former bureaucrats. Based on the nature of the  FTC's duty to promote fair business activity and free  competition, an array of personnel that speaks for the  government agencies is not desirable. Representatives of the  consumers and neutral persons such as scholars should be  appointed.    Political intervention can be rejected by enhancing  neutrality and by consistent and appropriate application of the  Antimonopoly Law.     "
0,FT923-15570 ,"FT923-15570 _AN-CGABQAFXFT 920701   FT  01 JUL 92 / Arts: Fuente Ovejuna - Theatre      By DAVID MURRAY   There is still a chance to catch Lope de Vega's 1619 play at the National Theatre before it travels north. Theatre-lovers who missed it last time round should pick up the telephone and book in haste. Except for young children and persons of especially timid disposition (there is a certain amount of rape and murder), it is hard to imagine that anyone could fail to find it both stirring and rewarding. The strong story is archetypal, or over the centuries has come to seem so, though Lope lights up his characters with individual touches. A Commander in the service of Ferdinand and Isabella, who has the village of Fuente Ovejuna as his fiefdom, is a voracious tyrant who at last goes too far. The village summons its collective courage to assassinate him, takes the cruel consequences, but survives through heroic solidarity: when the Inquisition comes to seek out the culprits, even under torture, nobody - man, woman or child - will say more than 'Fuente Ovejuna did it]' To our great relief they get away with it, but it is touch-and-go, and the 'happy ending' casts troubling shadows. Declan Donnellan's production has lost none of its cutting edge in this revival. It plays for just under two hours without an interval, seizing one's attention from the start and never letting go. Many of the original players remain: again James Laurenson's monstrous Commander is exquisitely detestable, and again Rachel Joyce plays his chief victim with disarming plainness and wrenching force. Her calf-eyed fiance is still Wilbert Johnson, funny and honestly touching. As the incorrigible village debater Mengo, Clive Rowe (who also sings, to excellent purpose) somehow manages to look exactly like Lenny Henry and Dawn French, which makes him irresistible. Pamela Nomvete's Pascuala is a match for him - but one ought to be praising everybody here: each of the many roles, large or small, is addressed with terrific commitment. Adrian Mitchell's colloquial-modern Englishing serves them and the drama well (unlike his recent version of Lope's Columbus play The Discovery of the New World, where the sacrifice of period rhetoric and dignity was a dull loss). The several elements of the show - Nick Ormerod's tellingly simple designs, Mick Hughes' bold lighting, above all Paddy Cunneen's toughly 'ethnic' music and Jane Gibson's direction of the massed parades and dances - meld into an indissoluble whole. Donnellan has imposed a tight theatrical form upon it which would probably have surprised the playwright (taut structures seem not to have concerned him much), but does him magnificent justice. The close-up vignettes live and breathe, within a stern formal plan that grips like a vice.

Stephen Yagman told jurors all they had to do was ""look at the videotape"" that  recorded the incident to see that the five San Bernardino County Sheriff's  Department deputies brutally beat the men and unlawfully arrested them in a  Victorville front yard on June 30, 1988.    Jury deliberations began late Friday.    In closing arguments of the three-week civil trial in Los Angeles Federal  Court, Yagman said of contradictory accounts from deputies: ""God only knows  what these officers would have said happened if this videotape didn't exist.""    But David A. Lawrence, attorney for the deputies, cautioned jurors that the  four-minute videotape of the confrontation offers only one, limited perspective  on the incident. Too conveniently, he added, it begins after one of the men  shoved a deputy and tried to grab the guns of two of the officers. Lawrence  asserted that jurors were being shown only part of what he believes was once a  longer videotape.    The case of the so-called ""Victorville Five"" is one of the first in which a  videotape has been used as evidence in a police brutality case in Federal  Court. Latino activists from San Bernardino County say the film also has  provided the first substantive evidence of what they allege has been a pattern  of racially motivated acts of brutality by deputies against minorities.    The videotape, made by a neighbor, ""captures in living color the acts of police  brutality we have said all along take place in our community,"" Armando Navarro,  executive director of a San Bernardino-based civil rights organization, said at  a news conference on the courthouse steps Friday.    Relations between law enforcement and minorities have improved dramatically  since the 1988 incident, which began with a complaint about a loud, drunken  party, Navarro said. But it took this case and ""the videotape of the violence  to begin a process of perestroika within the San Bernardino County Sheriff's  Department,"" he said.    Also named in the civil rights suit are Sheriff Floyd Tidwell and the County of  San Bernardino. U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima has ruled that claims  against Tidwell and the county would be tried separately by the same jury, but  only if jurors decide that the constitutional rights of one or more of the  plaintiffs were violated.    The plaintiffs -- Jose Serrano; his father, Efren Serrano; his brother, Victor  Serrano, and friends Auro Ruiz and Javier Ruelas -- claim that they suffered  serious bruises and injuries that went untreated. The lawyer for the deputies  has argued that the injuries amount to bruises and scratches, none of which  required hospitalization or immediate medical attention.    Yagman asked jurors Friday to award the plaintiffs $5,700 to cover medical  bills, a total of $1.7 million to compensate them for their pain and suffering,  and another $5 million in punitive damages as a message to the San Bernardino  County Sheriff's Department, and law enforcement agencies elsewhere.    In his closing arguments, Lawrence summarized contradictions in the testimony  of the five men about the alleged beatings. He said deputies did use batons,  fists, elbows and a chokehold to subdue the five men. But that force, he said,  was needed to control combative men who had been drinking beer for more than 12  hours in their front yard.

In his longest and most detailed statement on the Downing  Street initiative, Mr Hume said the Republican movement was  facing a challenge which amounted to ""one of the greatest acts  of moral courage this century.""    Mr Hume urged the two governments to clarify parts of the  declaration for Sinn Fein. He said: ""If all that has to be done  is to clarify certain parts of a certain document I would hope  that both governments would do everything in their power to make  clarification.""    Both governments have said they would not meet Sinn Fein's  demands for clarification until it renounces violence.    His comments appeared to be an attempt to keep alive the  peace process in the face of the growing impatience of Unionists  and the Government at Sinn Fein's continued failure to respond  to the declaration and renounce violence.    In a five-page statement, Mr Hume, whose joint initiative  with Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, has played an  important part in the peace process, said the document addressed  the reasons for armed struggle given by the IRA. These were  that the British were in Ireland defending their own interests  by force -- economic and strategic interests -- and that they  were preventing Irish people from exercising self-determination.    The Government had pledged it had ""no selfish economic or  strategic interest in Northern Ireland,"" and the Downing Street  declaration also accepted the principle that Irish people have  the right to decide their own future by agreement.    Mr Hume said the challenge facing all sides was that they  should come to the negotiating table armed only with their  convictions.    The republican movement was facing ""one of the greatest acts  of moral courage of this century. But it is moral courage that  gives real leadership and that creates truly historic  opportunity.""    His deputy, Mr Seamus Mallon, accused republican leaders of  putting out ""contradictory"" statements in response to the  declaration. Mr Mallon added: ""I have to believe that this is  deliberate and that, in effect, there is an approach being taken  by them (Sinn Fein) that is trying to confuse those who want to  get the movement to peace accelerated.""    Mr Adams and his deputy, Mr Martin McGuinness, have  reiterated support for republican principles but have stopped  short of outright rejection of the declaration. They appear to  be trying to reassure hardline republicans that there will be no  ""sell-out"" while indicating they see merit in the peace process.    As Sinn Fein continued to delay its formal response to the  declaration and maintained it would ""not be coerced into a hasty  decision,"" Unionists warned the Government that there should be  no ""stretching or development"" of the document. Mr James  Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist party leader, said at Lisburn, Co  Antrim, last night that the IRA's ""not unexpected refusal to  accept"" the declaration ""clears the way for a really effective  antiterrorist campaign.""    Mr Molyneaux added: ""While Irish governments usually have  little stomach for such decisive action, this time they have a  moral duty to deny sanctuary to terrorists.""    Mr Molyneaux said that Mr Hume was mistaken in his comments  because the IRA had already rejected the declaration. ""He  seemed to say it would require great moral courage on the part  of republicans to stop murdering people,"" Mr Molyneaux told the  BBC. ""I don't think it should require courage to do that. It  is common Christian action.""    An Ulster Volunteer Force parcel bomb was sent to the Sinn  Fein offices in Dublin and another to AN PHOBLACHT, the  republican newspaper. A bomb disposal officer lost part of his  thumb and another was slightly hurt when a device exploded while  being examined.     "
0,FT932-2035 ,"FT932-2035 _AN-DFUB2ADHFT 930621   FT  21 JUN 93 / Arts: William Golding - Lord of the sea / Obituary      By ANTHONY CURTIS   I happened to be there when Sir William Golding, who died on Friday aged 81, met Auden for the first time. After saying how much he had enjoyed Lord of the Flies - the first novel with which Golding leapt to fame in 1954 - Auden added that he thought the older boys on the desert island would have been more protective towards the younger ones. He felt that the appalling cruelties perpetrated as the boys fight for survival would not have happened in the way Golding described. Golding's reply came without any hesitation: 'Oh, they might have been protective for a while. But not in the end. It's a question of time. Seemingly endless time. That was what would have defeated their benevolence.' If one had to try to formulate a single theme underlying Golding's entire work as a writer of fiction, it would be this: survival in an extreme situation where time seems endless and there is no reprieve. It would apply as much to the early books as to his last great work, the sea-faring trilogy To the Ends of the Earth (Rites of Passage, Close Quarters and Fire Down Below) revealing how the passengers and crew in one of the old 18th century square-riggers try to survive amidst the hazards of a voyage to New Zealand. This work was an achievement of remarkable vigour and imaginative complexity for a writer in his seventies. A similar celebration of heroic endurance underlies such earlier triumphs as The Spire, Free Fall, Pincher Martin, Darkness Visible, all of them works of great originality. Golding served in the navy during the war and never lost his love of the sea. When he left the service he tried to become an actor (see The Pyramid). Then he became a classics teacher before the success of his first book enabled him to retire from that profession. He lived for many years at Broad Chalke near Salisbury and then in Cornwall where sailing was one of his chief recreations. Another was the game of chess which he played with a cheerful aggression. I had many enjoyable games with him in recent years - not over the board but by correspondence. In one of them in 1983 he was in a winning position when the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature intervened and amidst all the excitement he failed to see that he had left either a rook or a bishop exposed to capture by my knight. 'Oh fork it]' he wrote back in a note announcing his resignation, and requesting a new game. Golding's occasional visits to London were much treasured by his many friends in the literary world. Many of those attended a luncheon to celebrate his 80th birthday given by his publishers, Faber. The guest-list spanned several generations of literary life from the poet Stephen Spender to the novelist Ishiguro as well as a strong group up from Cornwall. It was some indication of the respect with which Golding was regarded by his peers. If personal memories of him will fade with time, his work seems certain to endure.

Pressure on the government to act has been intensified by public concern over killings and other violent incidents involving discharged patients. Ministers are expected to produce a package of changes, including the appointment of social workers with specific responsibility for released patients. The measures will be designed to offer greater protection to both mentally ill people and the public. About Pounds 2bn a year is spent on services for the mentally ill. An increasing proportion of this has been devoted to community-based services but mental health organisations say still more is required to provide adequate services for the numbers of patients now being released. The government's community care reforms, designed to enable the elderly and people with handicaps to live in the community, started in April. Ministers are aware that the the reforms' credibility could be jeopardised by continued acts of violence involving former mental patients.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

In his report on the situation in the Brcko region, Hamiz  Deronjic says that ""by bringing in reinforcement over several  past days, as well as last night, the Serbian aggressor has  carried out the strongest concentration of combat potential on  the Brcko region since the beginning of the war. The  Bijeljina-Brcko-Pelagicevo line has been simply (?clogged) with  enemy tanks, transporters, [word indistinct], trucks, buses,  vans, and (?luxurious) trains.

Further on in  the report, Deronjic says that ""in the last 24 hours, the  shelling of the Brcko defense lines has intensified. The  aggressor has been using recoilless guns, mortars, and Praga and  Bofors weapons. The regions of Poderiste, Tulmovici, and the  Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line were exposed to the most intensive  enemy fire yesterday evening.""    Mirza Sadikovic reports that ""in the past 24 hours, the  joint  aggressors failed to essentially change their activity on the  Bihac region. They continued attacking and provoking attacks at  almost all lines of separation in the zones covered by the 5th  Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Headquarters of  the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. Karadzic's terrorists were  unselectively shelling the defense lines, particularly on the  Bihac section of the front and they also shelled the suburbs  there. On the Grmusko-Srbljanski Height, they acted with  antiaircraft and anti-armor weapons. They shelled defense lines  as well as civilian districts on the free Bosanska Krupa  territory and (Buzim) region. Sniper activity was intensified  on all lines. The members of the Kladusa [Fikret Abdic's]  private paramilitary have, all the time, been firing mortars and  mountain guns from the strongholds in Donja (Lucka), (Trska),  and Golubovici, thus attacking Todorovo, the general region of  Krivaja, (Tesigrad), and Liskovac in the Cazin Commune.  Reliable reconnaissance reports forecast preparations for new  attacks both from the Kladusa Commune and the region of the  so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina.""

Further on, (Vitanovic) says that ""during last night, the enemy  continued occasional artillery attacks and early this morning  the region of Donji (Krajinci) was exposed to fierce attacks  with Bofors weapon (?from Vis). Later this morning, shelling of  the outskirts of the commune and occasional attacks with  machine-guns and antiaircraft weapons along the entire front  line has continued. At the end of this report from Kalesija,  let me say that, apart from offensive artillery-infantry  attacks, the enemy is also carrying out a regrouping of manpower  and bringing military hardware, particularly to the regions of  (Vis) and (Visocek).""    A report by the Information Service of the 4th Corps says  that ""while trying to cross the dam of the Mostar Hydroelectric  Power Plant over to the side controlled by the Army of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, two Italian journalists were  killed and one seriously wounded when they stepped on a mine  field.

By CHET CURRIER, ASSOCIATED PRESS      NEW YORK      The financial menu looks pretty skimpy as income-conscious investors consider  where to put their money for a new year and a new decade.    No matter how far in time you are willing to extend yourself, alluring returns  on certificates of deposit, bonds and other interest-bearing investments are  hard to find these days.    Certainly, you are unlikely to come across anything now that matches the  two-digit yields on low-risk securities that were so commonly available in the  early 1980s.    But inflation has also declined in recent years, and so has the maximum rate at  which the federal government taxes most people's interest income. So, in the  view of many analysts, the ""real"" returns offered now aren't as stingy as they  might look.    Suppose as 1990 begins that you can get a yield of 8.3% from a CD or  money-market mutual fund. If your income tax bracket is 28% -- the top rate  that applies to most savers and investors -- you have a return of 6% left over  after Uncle Sam takes his cut.    After taking into account consumer inflation in the 4% to 5% annual range, you  still emerge with a positive return.    On paper at least, that beats the results you might have achieved at a nominal  interest rate of, say, 13% a decade ago, when inflation and taxes together  would have left you actually in the red.    Of course, the current returns that savers and investors can get are only part  of the story. The ideal investment choice also must keep looking good through  the future ups and downs of inflation and interest rates.    Right now, many analysts are predicting at least a modest decline in interest  rates over the next several months. That would argue in favor of longer-term  investments such as CDs or bonds rather than short-term options such as money  market funds.    Unfortunately, interest rates at present are such that you get paid little or  nothing for making that kind of longer-term commitment.    A recent tally by the Bank Rate Monitor showed three-month CDs yielding an  average of 7.87%; two-year CDs 7.71%, and five-year CDs 7.73%.    This is known in financial circles as a flat, or slightly ""inverted,"" yield  curve, and it is abnormal although by no means unprecedented in modern history.    The yield curve has been out of kilter for more than a year now. But some  analysts think it is slowly beginning to resume a more orthodox shape.    For now, the Value Line Investment Survey, the nation's largest independent  investment advisory service, recommends keeping your options open by sticking  mainly with short-term commitments.

Staying short term, of course, also gives you protection should interest rates  pull a surprise by heading higher. In that event, yields on vehicles such as  money market funds would stand to move up as well.

But Kobe is itself a manufacturer of conventional metal hip joints and is attracted by the potential of Promotus's new material, Proplast. It is soft and extremely porous - made from an open matrix of PTFE (a high performance plastic) coated with hydroxyapatite (the mineral in bone). The Promotus implant has a coating of Proplast over the metal stem that fits into the central cavity of the patient's thigh bone. This has two advantages over conventional hard implants, according to the company: it acts like a shock-absorber, allowing natural 'micro-motion' to take place in the artificial joint; and it encourages the body's own connective tissues to grow into the stem and make it more stable.

SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Most Americans believe the U.S. Constitution gives them a right to privacy in  their personal lives that shields them from government interference in such  things as the sex acts of adult homosexuals and a family's decision to end life  support for a hopelessly ill relative, according to a survey on the Supreme  Court and the Constitution released Sunday.    The notion of a constitutional right to privacy is so firmly entrenched that a  majority of those surveyed asserted -- incorrectly -- that the right is written  into the Constitution.    While the word ""privacy"" does not appear in the Bill of Rights or anywhere else  in the Constitution, a majority of the Supreme Court has concluded that the  ""right to liberty"" in the 14th Amendment implies a right to privacy in matters  such as birth control and abortion.    But this conclusion remains a subject of continuing dispute between the court's  conservative and liberal factions.    The liberals say the general rights set forth in the Constitution should be  interpreted broadly to protect individuals from the government. But the  conservatives maintain that the court should not create unwritten  constitutional rights so as to strike down laws enacted by the majority.    This dispute flares anew with each abortion case to come before the high court.  It also figures prominently in the battles over drug testing and the ""right to  die.""    The survey responses suggest that the public finds the right to privacy as  tricky and troublesome as has the high court.    Although 73% of those surveyed say the Constitution guarantees a right to  privacy, a solid majority said this right does not allow employees to refuse  drug tests, nor does it give teen-age girls the right to get an abortion  without their parents' knowledge.    The survey of 805 adults was conducted for the National Law Journal and LEXIS,  the computerized legal research service, and was intended to mark the 200th  anniversary of the Supreme Court.    It found that most Americans could not name a single member of the Supreme  Court, nor even how many members of the court there are. The respondents also  said -- incorrectly -- that last year's abortion ruling from the high court  allowed states to make abortion illegal. The 5-4 ruling in June said states may  prevent their employees from aiding abortion, but women retain the right to  terminate a pregnancy.    Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed drew a blank when asked to name a sitting  justice. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's only woman, was by far the  best known of the nine justices. Most of those questioned disagreed sharply  with the court's recent decisions on flag burning, civil rights and  homosexuality.     -- Only 40% agreed with the court's 5-4 ruling last year that flag burning was  protected as free speech. About 46% disagreed with the decision, and in a  separate response, 63% favored a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag  burning.     -- Only 31% said the court has ""gone as far as it should"" to protect victims  of discrimination, while 53% said the court has ""not gone far enough."" In a  series of 5-4 rulings last year, the court narrowed the scope of federal civil  rights laws.     -- About 66% said the right to privacy ""protects private, voluntary acts of  homosexuals,"" while 26% disagreed. In 1986, the court ruled 5 to 4 that states  may criminalize private homosexual behavior.    However, the public agreed with the court majority on drug testing. Only 34%  said the right to privacy prohibits random drug testing of employees. Last  year, the court voted 5 to 4 to uphold drug testing for public employees in  jobs involving safety or sensitive information.    When asked who should decide whether to ""end artificial life support"" if you  lapse into a coma, 88% said ""your family.""

SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Most Americans believe the U.S. Constitution gives them a right to privacy in  their personal lives that shields them from government interference in such  things as the sex acts of adult homosexuals and a family's decision to end life  support for a hopelessly ill relative, according to a survey on the Supreme  Court and the Constitution released Sunday.    The notion of a constitutional right to privacy is so firmly entrenched that a  majority of those surveyed asserted -- incorrectly -- that the right is written  into the Constitution.    While the word ""privacy"" does not appear in the Bill of Rights or anywhere else  in the Constitution, a majority of the Supreme Court has concluded that the  ""right to liberty"" in the 14th Amendment implies a right to privacy in matters  such as birth control and abortion.    But this conclusion remains a subject of continuing dispute between the court's  conservative and liberal factions.    The liberals say the general rights set forth in the Constitution should be  interpreted broadly to protect individuals from the government. But the  conservatives maintain that the court should not create unwritten  constitutional rights so as to strike down laws enacted by the majority.    This dispute flares anew with each abortion case to come before the high court.  It also figures prominently in the battles over drug testing and the ""right to  die.""    The survey responses suggest that the public finds the right to privacy as  tricky and troublesome as has the high court.    Although 73% of those surveyed say the Constitution guarantees a right to  privacy, a solid majority said this right does not allow employees to refuse  drug tests, nor does it give teen-age girls the right to get an abortion  without their parents' knowledge.    The survey of 805 adults was conducted for the National Law Journal and LEXIS,  the computerized legal research service, and was intended to mark the 200th  anniversary of the Supreme Court.    It found that most Americans could not name a single member of the Supreme  Court, nor even how many members of the court there are. The respondents also  said -- incorrectly -- that last year's abortion ruling from the high court  allowed states to make abortion illegal. The 5-4 ruling in June said states may  prevent their employees from aiding abortion, but women retain the right to  terminate a pregnancy.    Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed drew a blank when asked to name a sitting  justice. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's only woman, was by far the  best known of the nine justices. Most of those questioned disagreed sharply  with the court's recent decisions on flag burning, civil rights and  homosexuality.     -- Only 40% agreed with the court's 5-4 ruling last year that flag burning was  protected as free speech. About 46% disagreed with the decision, and in a  separate response, 63% favored a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag  burning.     -- Only 31% said the court has ""gone as far as it should"" to protect victims  of discrimination, while 53% said the court has ""not gone far enough."" In a  series of 5-4 rulings last year, the court narrowed the scope of federal civil  rights laws.     -- About 66% said the right to privacy ""protects private, voluntary acts of  homosexuals,"" while 26% disagreed. In 1986, the court ruled 5 to 4 that states  may criminalize private homosexual behavior.    However, the public agreed with the court majority on drug testing. Only 34%  said the right to privacy prohibits random drug testing of employees. Last  year, the court voted 5 to 4 to uphold drug testing for public employees in  jobs involving safety or sensitive information.    When asked who should decide whether to ""end artificial life support"" if you  lapse into a coma, 88% said ""your family.""

The statement indicates that following an exchange of fire  with prison guards, the attackers managed to destroy alarm  devices and stormed the prison, thanks to collusion from two  members of the prison staff, according to initial investigations.    The statement adds that as a result of this assault, a  number  of persons convicted of assassination and acts of sabotage  managed to escape. During the attack and resistance from the  guards, the assailants killed one guard and seriously injured  another four. They also took seven guards hostage.    Following this operation, the combined forces took the  necessary security measures to rearrest the escapees and the  assailants. So far, these forces have been able to apprehend  around 39 persons. Another five have been killed during an  exchange of fire. The manhunt and combing operation continues.     "

C. HAMMER AND SINEAD  O'CONNOR IS PART OF A LARGER BREAKTHROUGH THAT INDICATES INCREASING ACCEPTANCE  OF FRESH FACES AMONG FANS AND RADIO PROGRAMMERS.      By STEVE HOCHMAN      There's been a change on the pop music charts. The old reliable superstars that  have in recent years been the anchors of pop sales are having to make room for  new faces and new styles.    The most dramatic examples involve the success of Irish singer Sinead O'Connor,  whose ""I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got"" is entering its fifth week as the  nation's best-selling album, and the finally indisputable arrival of rap, which  had been viewed for nearly a decade by the record industry as little more than  a passing fad.    The success of albums by such rap acts as M. C. Hammer and Public Enemy is also  part of a larger breakthrough of new acts that indicates increasing acceptance  of new faces among pop music fans and radio programmers.    Though individual rap acts, including Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys, have had  platinum albums in the past, the new rush of rap best-sellers has caught the  industry by surprise.    ""Everyone was scared of rap,"" said Michael Martin, music director of Los  Angeles radio station KIIS-FM (102.7). ""But rap is unavoidable. When you have  people like M. C. Hammer (having big hits), people have to stop closing their  ears.""    Concurred Al Tavera, Martin's counterpart at KPWR-FM (105.9): ""It's amazing how  well rap is doing with adults as well as kids. That's a trend I see changing. I  think the audience is accepting (rap) more than a few years ago.""    A check of the Billboard pop albums chart confirms this. Hammer's ""Please  Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em"" album, with sales at about 2 million, is pushing  O'Connor for the No. 1 spot and is joined in the top dozen albums by the  rap-influenced Bell Biv Devoe's ""Poison"" at No. 9 and Public Enemy's  controversial ""Fear of a Black Planet"" at No. 11.    The Top 15 singles include the title cut from the Bell Biv Devoe album at No.  8, Digital Underground's ""Humpty Dance"" at No. 14 and Hammer's ""U Can't Touch  This"" at No. 15.    ""We never expected something like 'Humpty Dance' to work like that,"" said  Tavera. ""We thought it would be a nice underground record, but it turned into a  major pop single.""    But rap's not alone in bringing new vitality to the sales charts, which --  except for occasional breakthroughs such as Paula Abdul and Soul II Soul --  were chiefly the domain in recent years of veteran superstars.    O'Connor is joined in the Top 12 albums this week by Depeche Mode, which was  formerly considered a cult band, and rookie Lisa Stansfield.    ""It seems the major superstar acts are taking the safe route, coming out with  very formula songs,"" said Martin. ""Radio listeners take a more aggressive  stance, which is where the new names are coming out. Not that (listeners) don't  like hearing Phil Collins or Michael Bolton any more, but in between they like  hearing the M. C. Hammers and Bell Biv Devoes and Digital Undergrounds that are  crossing over to become hits.""    The irony is that rap's success has a lot to do with its reliance on the  familiar. Hammer's hit, for instance, is built on a sampled bass line from Rick  James' 1980 hit ""Super Freak.""    ""Half the people don't know they're hearing M. C. Hammer,"" said Martin. ""We get  people calling asking, 'Would you play ""Super Freak,"" but the one with the rap  in it?' ""    But the success of rap goes beyond that, as evidenced by the Public Enemy  album, an angry black power statement that has had a lot of media attention,  but virtually no radio play outside of the nation's few specifically  rap-oriented stations. That, say some industry observers, proves the legitimacy  of the form, dismissing the notion that the album is selling largely on the  strength of the critical debate it has stirred.    ""I don't think people run out and buy things just because they're  controversial,"" said Warner Bros. senior vice president and director of sales  Lou Dennis. ""You've got to like what you're buying. Your curiosity might get  you, but it's not like the old days when they used to ban a book in Boston and  then everybody would try to buy it. I think people are reacting to the Public  Enemy album because it's saying something they want to say.""    The arrival of the best-selling newcomers these days is no accident, suggest  representatives of record companies and retail outlets.    ""One thing our business has determined is that you have to have stars of  tomorrow,"" said Lou Mann, vice president of sales at Capitol Records, whose  roster includes both new-guard chart-topper Hammer and old-guard Heart, whose  new album is currently No. 3. ""There has been an emphasis for the last 18  months on developing new talent and we're starting to see the fruits.""    Mitch Perliss, director of purchasing for Show Industries, the parent company  of the 75-store Music Plus chain, says that he hasn't seen any increase of  sales, but he is seeing better quality sales, i.e. the same customers seeking  wider variety than before.    ""It's refreshing,"" he said. ""Our feeling is you have to have the (reliable)  sales base of a Phil Collins or Michael Jackson or Rolling Stones. But in my  mind, the whole business is new artists, developing new artists that have  longevity. . . . What we need to do is not just have a Phil Collins buyer come  in when he has a new release, but turn that buyer on to something else he or  she might also enjoy.""    With that in mind record companies and retailers have been working together on  aggressive campaigns to expose new acts, such as offering money-back guarantees  on selected releases and not giving up on promising records even if initial  sales are disappointing.    Said Capitol's Lou Mann: ""It used to be you'd throw new product out there and  try to get it played (on radio) and if you couldn't in six weeks, you dropped  it.

Therefore, a new government has to  be formed on the basis of its attitude toward the CIS.    ""The present parliamentary majority is a pro-Russian force  and consequently did not block the illegal decision of the head  of state. Joining the CIS contradicts the acts of 26 May 1918  and 9 April 1991 [on the declaration of Georgia's independence].  In this way, the present government has abolished itself.""    In the view of Irakli Tsereteli, there is no party existing  in Georgia today that can form a government. Therefore,  national forces should govern the state together.

[passage omitted]    In late December 1993, the personal representative of  Abdullah Ocalan, Zahir Bardani, met with political leaders of  Armenia in Echmiadzin. The representative of Armenians of  Nagorno-Karabakh, Levon Melik-Shakhnazarov attended the meeting  as well. As a result of the meeting, the KWP headquarters was  partially moved to Armenia and 660 Kurdish soldiers appeared in  Armenian units fighting against Azerbaijan.    But cooperation of Armenians and Kurds began long before the  meeting in Echmiadzin. Since 1988, Kurdish soldiers have been  training together with Armenian terrorists from ""ASALA""  [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] in Cyprus.  Soon, Abdullah Ocalan gave $1.2 million to build an additional  base for the training of Armenian and Kurdish soldiers.    Earlier, Western journalists having visited Armenian regions  neighbouring Turkey, reported that there were 21 bases training  Kurdish soldiers. According to the same sources, the Kurds have  been conducting subversive acts in Turkey from those bases.     "

Prominent figures belonging to armed  formations are, to all intents and purposes, being wiped out  gradually and almost in a systematic manner. The hallmarks are  identical in almost every case. Unfortunately, the law  enforcement bodies have not uncovered a single fact concerning  this terrorism. Who could be responsible for this? Nothing can  be excluded in our troubled times. The point is that countless  armed groups are active in the country. The general public  knows that relations between these groups are far from good and,  on this basis, we could be dealing with clashes between mafia  clans or a ""mafia war"" similar to that in the United States in  the 1930's. The reason lies in the redistribution of spheres  and lines of action. As a result of the existing unstable  political factor in the country, it is quite possible that  certain political forces are also interested in the ""removal"" of  some of these people. There is also another element -- external  forces that, today, are not creating or are unable to create new  hot spots in Georgia (life is, to a certain extent, following  its course) and this method gives them the means to preserve a  certain measure of instability and create an atmosphere of fear  among the population. It is known that recent terrorist acts  have resulted in the deaths of innocent people. Therefore, such  a serious situation in the country enables both external and  internal political forces to destroy physically their main  political rivals. Unfortunately, one can expect the further  development of events in this direction: It is much easier  today to get rid of a political rival with a bomb than have him  arrested. So, if the authorities are unable to dispel these  suspicions, they should at least aim to unmask the perpetrators  of these terrorist acts in order to restore order. Otherwise,  we will have every reason to believe that the current  authorities are creating the serious situation prevailing in  Georgia.    [Natadze] I have specific information (about one month now)  that Russia is planning to occupy Georgia within six months  using several divisions. The first stage: One and a half  months will be needed to disarm bands and also, against this  background, all those left [in possession of weapons] or, in  other words, the physical removal of weapons from Georgia. The  next month and a half will be needed for the production of  meager ""calories"" (loans, supplies) and the final three months  will be needed for the creation of its own power structures  (troops to guard the railways...). As I knew, in order to  embark upon this operation, Russia needed an ""invitation""; if  not from parliament (naturally, they would not be able to get it  from parliament) and if not from the head of state (the head of  state would never take such a direct step), at any rate, from  some kind of elite group of 200-300 persons. The so-called  proletariat is no longer suitable for such a thing as it was in  1921. That needed a clever elite. They have been unable to  muster such a group, not because there are not 200-300  unscrupulous people in Georgia, but because this potential group  of unscrupulous people has the ability to make minor forecasts.  They know what to expect by taking such a step. As can be  seen, they [Russia] have abandoned such a move and have started  to take direct action. I think that what is happening is state  terrorism; only, the state concerned is not Georgia but a  neighboring one that has countless agents in Georgia.

What could awaken feelings anesthetized by injections of  Israeli deception more than images of innocent blood shed in the  holy place in Hebron? What sanctities do those -- who claim to  be the descendants of Abraham -- believe in while they shed  innocent blood in the Ibrahimi mosque? What act of  international terrorism can be compared with what was committed  by the sinful Zionist hand against innocent Palestinians in  Hebron today?    This is one of a series of similar Zionist terrorist acts  that have continued since before 1948. They will not stop as  long as Zionists continue their arrogance and sin without  meeting deterrence from anyone in the name of humanity,  international legitimacy, or international determination to stop  their recklessness. They will not stop as long these Zionists  continue to see the world's silence about their crimes as  collusion giving them a free hand to desecrate anything, with no  deterrence of their oppression, terrorism, ambitions, and  violations of all noble and honorable human values coming from  anyone.    What is the reaction of the NATO members, who were justly  shocked by the market crime against scores of innocent people in  Sarajevo almost two weeks ago? Then, they issued a warning to  the killers and delivered an ultimatum, and the killers bowed to  the warning. Doesn't Arab blood incite any reaction from them,  or even any feeling of sympathy or mercy? It should not be  understood from this that Arabs are begging for sympathy or  mercy from anyone, or that they are waiting for another  international condemnation or denunciation statement. All the  international condemnation statements have not restored any of  their rights and have not stopped the violent onslaught of  Zionist terrorism and aggression. So far, all the international  resolutions have failed to enable Palestinians and Arabs to  restore any of their rights, because those who control the  international will lack the firm determination to force Israel  to pay attention to these resolutions.    Moreover, rather than employing effective international  pressure on Israel to heed international legitimacy's  resolutions and principles, we have seen acts of collusion  represented by silence or carelessness in order to circumvent  this legitimacy. The result of this is the daily horrible  massacres and crimes Zionists commit against innocent  Palestinians, without concern for values, norms, or principles.    The Israeli Government cannot dissociate itself from the  crime of massacre committed at the Ibrahimi mosque today by  claiming it was the act of an extremist or a deranged Zionist,  or that of a Zionist with any other adjective that may be  attributed to him in order to cover up the ugliness of the crime.    Direct responsibility for this crime, and for any other  crime  committed by Zionist settlers or occupation forces, is  shouldered by the Tel Aviv rulers who insisted, and are  insisting, on keeping the Arab land they usurped, and who  encouraged, and are encouraging, the settlers to remain on this  land.    The Tel Aviv rulers, who fabricated and ignored the facts of  history and geography, rejected the principles of justice and  disrespected the resolutions of international legitimacy, and  considered occupied Palestinian land a disputed land to which  Zionist settlers have more right than its original owners --  these rulers are the ones who planted, and are planting, the  seeds of terrorism that were terribly manifested today in the  Ibrahimi mosque massacre.    We have said and warned more than once that what Israel is  doing in the name of the so-called peace that it is hiding  behind is nothing more than aggravating elements of tension and  explosion, spreading terrorism, and endangering stability and  security in the region.    What happened today is only one part of these elements. This  will continue as long as Israel remains unrestrained and free  from any control that deters its extravagance and stops its  crimes and terrorism.    Will the world wake up and pay attention before it is too  late, before Israel pushes the entire region, by its antipeace  positions and practices, to the edge of an explosion?     "

In  this regard it is playing an important role in the peace process  to achieve stability and prosperity in the region.    President Mubarak was speaking during a meeting he held  today  with a delegation of the American Association of Chief Editors  of Newspapers and Magazines, which includes 14 chief editors and  publishers from various parts of the United States.    Muhammad 'Abd-al-Mun'im, head of the Presidential Press  Office, stated that President Mubarak described U.S.-Egyptian  relations as good.    President Mubarak said the peace agreement between the  Palestinians and the Israelis was just a start and that Egypt is  doing its utmost to achieve stability in this part of the world.    President Mubarak stressed that peace has become a  necessity.  After it is achieved, numerous marginal problems could be  solved. He explained that Egypt's firm goal is to establish  peace and security in the region, offering prosperity to  everyone.    Asked about Egyptian-Iranian relations, President Mubarak  said that since coming to power, he has wanted to maintain good  relations with every country. But the Iranians have policies of  their own.    President Mubarak reaffirmed that terrorism has no future in  Egypt and Egypt embraces many Arab institutions and acts  according to the law and Constitution. We abide by the law, he  said.    He noted: We could have ended terrorism within a few days  had we resorted to emergency measures. But we abide by the law.  We are encouraged that all the popular factions are against  terrorism and do not sympathize with it. Citizens' reports on  the terrorists and their activities were a primary factor in  uncovering and arresting them.    'Abd-al-Mun'im said that President Mubarak emphasized that  religions are a very sensitive issue, adding that the  establishment of religious parties must be avoided and noting  that the extremists do not seek democracy. Ultimately they want  to establish their own style of dictatorship, he said.    President Mubarak explained that he is not against anyone  but  always works for stability and security.    Regarding U.S. aid, President Mubarak said: We know the aid  will not continue forever. We need this aid for a few more  years until peace is established throughout the area. We use  most of this aid to strengthen the Armed Forces. He noted that  many security problems exist in the area.    The president also dealt with the population issue. He  affirmed that the birth rate has recently dropped and noted that  he has drawn attention to this problem because it constitutes a  real threat to the state. He also noted that the popular  response has been positive.    In response to a question on tourism, President Mubarak  said that the number of tourists dropped after the Gulf war and  increased after the acts of violence by terrorists. [sentence as  received] He noted that there is now a noticeable improvement  as everyone realizes that the wave of violence, which is  supported by certain foreign countries, has ebbed. He stressed  that Egypt is firm on dealing with terrorism within the  framework of legitimacy and law. He pointed out that efforts of  those who are trying to threaten Egypt are to no avail. He  discussed the domestic situation since he assumed power and  reviewed the great projects in the fields of infrastructure,  transport, energy, housing, schools, factories, and new cities.    'Abd-al-Mun'im said that in his meeting with the U.S. press  delegation, President Mubarak touched on investment in Egypt and  explained the removal of numerous obstacles, the last of which  was exempting investors from routine measures, which will cost  the government 10 million pounds. He noted that these steps  have greatly encouraged investment and that three months after  making this decision, 180 projects were begun in Suhaj and other  areas in Upper Egypt.    In discussing the water problem and its scarcity on regional  and international levels, President Mubarak stressed that if  peace does not prevail, frictions and conflicts may flare up  because of water scarcity. He noted that Egypt is using its  water resources in the best possible way.     "

0,FT942-3594 ,"FT942-3594 _AN-EFND1AETFT 940614   FT  14 JUN 94 / Arts: Domingo's noble savage - Opera      By ANDREW CLARK   In the Bonn Opera programme for Antonio Carlos Gomes's Il Guarany (The Guarani), there is a photograph of Mario del Monaco, bronzed and naked except for a loin-cloth, taken in 1949 when he sang the title role in Rio de Janeiro. Del Monaco's enthusiasm for this four-act opera-ballo was such that his son vowed to make it more widely known. Now intendant in Bonn, Gian-Carlo del Monaco has realised his boyhood dream. He persuaded Placido Domingo to learn the part his father had sung, brought in Sony to record it, and has helped illuminate a neglected corner of 19th century repertoire. The first Brazilian composer to achieve international fame, Gomes (1836-96) won a government scholarship to study in Milan. Il Guarany had a triumphant premiere at La Scala in 1870 and performances followed in Rio, London and New York. As the descendant of a Guarani Indian, Gomes was naturally drawn to Jose de Alancar's love story of 16th century colonial Brazil. The chief characters are Peri, a Guarani Indian, and Cecilia, daughter of a Portuguese nobleman. Their love flourishes despite the prejudice of her father, the treachery of her Spanish admirer Gonzales and a running conflict with the cannibal Aymore Indians. In a utopian ending, Peri and Cecilia alone survive to found a lineage which will reconcile Indians and colonial incomers. Since the 1930s Il Guarany has enjoyed the status of a Brazilian national opera - but apart from the setting, there is nothing Brazilian about it. With a long ballet (heavily cut in Bonn), static choral tableaux and an Italian libretto, it mixes grand operatic style with the melodic verve of early Verdi. Gomes gives the same Italianate colouring to the natives as he does to the Europeans, and is unable to hide a patchwork quality. The work's appeal lies in its exotic jungle location and the opportunities it provides for beautiful singing. The idea of inviting Werner Herzog to stage the German premiere had a superficial logic - his film Fitzcarraldo is also set in the Amazonian jungle. However, Herzog has yet to reveal himself as a natural theatre man. His production, designed by Maurizio Balo and Franz Blumauer, unfolded within a cavernous frame of rampant undergrowth, and updated the setting to the early 19th century. The action was static, the choreography lamentable. On the positive side, a complicated plot came over clearly, and the singers held centre-stage. As Peri, Domingo joins a distinguished line of interpreters including Gigli. And this was vintage Domingo, singing in the language and style that suit him best. Unrecognisable behind Indian feathered head-dress and facial markings, his noble savage was thoroughly believable. The part taps his lyrical and heroic strengths, and found him in full, fluent voice. Gomes hands all the display arias to the soprano, sung here with clean and gracious aplomb by Veronica Villaroel. Carlos Alvarez's Gonzales was a lyric baritone of unmistakable class. Chorus and comprimarios were good, but the orchestral playing under John Neschling was dull. I enjoyed Il Guarany. Within the limits of its style, it has charm and vitality. And thanks to Domingo, the Bonn performances had the atmosphere of a real operatic occasion. Last Domingo performance tonight   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

However, people must ask how long can Patten ""hold out""? In  fact, it is not difficult at all to answer this question. As  long as we look at how many cards he has, the answer is all too  obvious.    Let us look at his ""homeland card."" When Patten came to Hong  Kong, the first thing he did was to show this ""trump card."" At  that time, with almost ""unanimous"" support in domestic political  circles and the British press, Patten was in high spirits and  vigorous and made a showy display of his abilities. However, he  never thought of the ""fire in the back yard"" which is now  occurring, and he has even stopped boasting about ""full support  in London."" On 8 December 1993, Percy Cradock, a former foreign  affairs adviser to the British prime minister and a former  ambassador to Beijing, and two other former ambassadors to  Beijing--Alan Donald and Richard Evans--were present at a public  hearing on Sino-British relations held by the British Foreign  Affairs Committee. They criticized Patten's political reform  package as a policy of ""self-destruction"" and called on the  British Government to immediately stop the ""rash and risky  policy of unilaterally implementing political reform in Hong  Kong."" At a Conservative Party meeting held in the middle of  January, former Prime Minister Heath blamed Patten for causing  unnecessary damage to Sino-British relations."" Early this year,  former Labor prime minister James Callaghan and former foreign  secretary Geoffrey Howe also objected on many occasions to  Britain's threatening and antagonistic attitude in handling the  Hong Kong issue. On the other hand, Hong Kong's SOUTH CHINA  MORNING POST reported that when the House of Lords debated the  Hong Kong issue not long ago, ""only one person said he supported  Patten,"" while in the House of Commons, ""many people voiced  their disapproval of the consequences brought about by Patten's  policy."" Meanwhile, there are divergent views within the  British Government. The FINANCIAL TIMES published an article  last December on the failed Sino-British talks. The article  quoted high-ranking officials, who said that to everyone's  surprise, Patten did not take heed of the fact that in 1990 the  Chinese foreign minister and his British counterpart had  discussed and reached agreement on Hong Kong's 1994/95 elections  when he drafted his political reform package. The article also  revealed that following the 15th round of talks, the British  side had drafted a memorandum of understanding in accordance  with the Chinese side's suggestions, but Patten had insisted on  adding a clause that a single-seat, single-vote system would  also be applied to the Legislative Council [Legco] elections,  thus sabotaging the Sino-British talks.    The British press criticized Patten in a more candid way. On  20 December 1993, THE SUN published an editorial entitled  ""Patten--the Most Cynical and Impudent Swindler."" The editorial  blamed Patten for wrecking Anglo-Chinese relations due to his  hypocritical preaching of democracy in Hong Kong, which  consequently made it difficult for large firms such as British  Aerospace and Rolls-Royce to win contracts in China. The  editorial held that what Patten had done was for his own  personal honor. Before taking up the governorship of Hong Kong,  Patten lost an election in his Bath constituency, and this  result even cheered his Conservative Party colleagues. Hence,  after taking up the governorship of Hong Kong, he has to try  every possible means to rehabilitate himself and his political  career. The editorial pointed out incisively that it was  ""really stupid"" for Britain, which had never held any democratic  elections in Hong Kong during its 150-years rule, and to  antagonize China with less than four years to go before turning  over ruling authority was ""really stupid."" ""The price is too  heavy if Hong Kong is sacrificed for Patten's personal  ambitions."" THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH also published a commentary  which pointed out: ""For those British businessmen who want to  get into the China market, they do not understand why the  Westminster model of democracy has to be introduced at a time  when Hong Kong will revert to China three and a half years  later. Hong Kong Governor Patten is engaging in a political  gamble, but Britain has to pay a price in employment  opportunities and investment prospects.""    It is even more obvious that British business circles, which  always set great store by business interests, are dissatisfied  with Patten. Early this year, several British newspapers  successively reported that since the British Government had  implemented its antagonistic policies toward China, a  considerable number of British-invested financial groups had  found that their London background had become a ""burden"" in  China trade. Some British firms which are eager to get into the  China market would rather do business with Beijing through their  overseas subsidiaries for fear that their London background will  spoil everything. Hong Kong's MING PAO reported on 29 January  that Carter, president of Britain's Birmingham Chamber of  Commerce, had told British Foreign Secretary Hurd at a dinner:  ""British moves in Hong Kong will damage Anglo-Chinese trade.""    To put it in a nutshell, the very foundation from which  Patten received ""unanimous"" support in Britain has been shaken.    Let us look at his ""international card."" Patten once  traveled far and wide to make Hong Kong an international issue  so that he could bully people on the strength of his  connections. However, he has been disappointed with the response  of the international community so far. Former Prime Minister of  Singapore Lee Kuan Yew has publicly exposed, on many occasions,  the British Government's and Patten's political aims and has  criticized Britain's antagonistic policy towards China. After  that, former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser wrote an  article in THE AUSTRALIAN for the third time not long ago to  attack Patten. Fraser said that the fact that Patten was trying  so resolutely to build up ""democracy"" in Hong Kong at a time  when British colonial rule was about to end could only be  interpreted as ""mischief and stirring up chaos,"" which is ""a  kind of wanton behavior."" He urged the Australian Government to  advise ""Britain to suspend and for Patten to withdraw this rash  and misleading policy."" On 6 January, (Chan Chek-yu), head of  the Bureau of Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Canadian Foreign  Ministry and who was visiting Hong Kong and China, publicly  denied that Canada had expressed support for Patten's political  reform package. He reaffirmed that the Canadian Government  supported the Sino-British Joint Declaration. As reported by  the HONGKONG STANDARD on 4 February, even the United States,  which has a special relationship with Britain, ""is not willing  to reaffirm its support for the Hong Kong governor.""    Playing the ""public opinion card"" is Patten's specialty, but  how is Hong Kong public opinion now? Allan Rogers, foreign  affairs spokesman of the British Labor Party, said that after  listening to views expressed by various circles in Hong Kong,  among those whom he came into contact with, most were primarily,  and to a far greater extent, concerned about their own lives and  the question of whether or not the transition of Hong Kong would  be smooth than about reform of the political system. (Adeley),  chairman of the Chinese Affairs Subcommittee of the British  Parliament, did not even mince his words. He said that Patten  had not consulted Legco and the people of Hong Kong at all  before he did anything in Hong Kong, so how could there be  ""public opinion""? After all, playing the ""public opinion card""  to portray an image of ""keeping in close touch with the people""  is the consistent work style of a politician. As indicated by  an opinion poll at the end of January conducted by an  independent market research company which was entrusted by MING  PAO, there is a markedly growing number of citizens who are  asking for Patten to be dismissed from his post. Hong Kong's  SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST even reported on 23 January that Hong  Kong's Liberal Party, which is ""one of the most influential  parties in Hong Kong,"" announced that they are ""withdrawing  their support given to Patten's package.""    Perhaps some people praise Patten for his courage, but more  and more people understand that this is a kind of irresponsible  courage. Just as Craddock, former foreign affairs adviser to the  prime minister of Britain, said: ""If it is you who bears the  consequences of your own act of heroism, your heroism is above  reproach. But if you carry out a heroic act at the expense of  others' interests, and particularly the interests of those who  trust you--as we are doing in Hong Kong--it is precisely a  different story."" Patten's willful acts will inevitably  endanger Hong Kong's prosperity and stability at present, and  after 1997, but he will not be the one who will bear such  consequences. He will simply go away after 30 June 1997 and the  chaotic situation stirred up by him must be cleared up by the  people of Hong Kong. So here is the ""last Hong Kong governor""  who always claims to think about the interests of Hong Kong  people but who is not as good as his word.    Now, the British Government has been thrown into confusion.  The UK correspondent of Hong Kong's DONGFANG RIBAO [ORIENTAL  DAILY NEWS] reports that when Patten and senior British cabinet  officials discussed the issue of whether or not he should table  the remaining part of his political reform draft to Legco, they  held divergent views and differences between them were gradually  widening. Senior officials in the Foreign Office, including  Foreign Secretary Hurd, have leaned towards supporting a prudent  direction, saying that the original package must be greatly  amended so that the ""Chinese side will feel that the British  side still strictly abides by the stipulations of the Basic Law  and the Sino-British Joint Declaration.""    Why has Patten, who was once smug, fallen into such a  predicament? Apart from the fact that his unjustifiable moves  are unpopular, another important factor is that mainland China,  which is full of vitality, is absolutely able to maintain Hong  Kong's prosperity and stability after 1997, is marching to the  world with great strides, and has become a vital force in the  international economy. Recently, such key western countries as  the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia, and France  have conformed to the trend of the times and have successively  reviewed their policies towards China to strive for friendly  cooperation with China and to get into the China market in order  to achieve huge economic gains. However, Britain is going  against the tide and is inevitably in an isolated and passive  position. Patten still insists on ""braving the north wind,"" but  how long can he hold out?     "

In an annual report on the domestic and international  security situations, the Public Security Investigation Agency  said the extremists escalated ""indiscriminate"" attacks against  targets including national cultural treasures and  state-designated national assets.    The report also cited guerrilla activities targeting the  April visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko to the  southernmost island of Okinawa and the March dispatch of a  second Self-Defense force engineering contingent to Cambodia.    The report said ultrarightists have escalated activities  against Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa after he voiced in his  August policy speech remorse and apology to Asian people for  atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers in World War II.    It said about 2,260 international guerrilla cases were  reported, of which seven targeted Japanese people and companies.    The Public Security Investigation Agency, established in  1952, collects intelligence on extremist groups in line with the  1952 Antisubversive Activities Law which is designed to crack  down on subversive groups.

Yakutsk Mayor Aleksey Tomtosov told ITAR-TASS by  telephone on Monday morning that the terrorist was a certain  Abdulayev, who had been earlier convicted three times.

It was soon found out that Abdulayev had planted no bombs.  It was also established that no group Vozmezdie (Retribution)  existed: it was an invention of the hardened criminal who wanted  money to pay off major debts and ""enjoy some good living,"" as he  put it himself. Aleksey Tomtosov said criminal proceedings had  been instituted.

The minister's spokesman,  Karl-Heinz Schneider, announced today in a DDP/ADN interview  that steps would be taken against any people participating in  such actions ""with the full severity of the criminal and aliens'  law."" The government and states had closely cooperated to  prepare measures aimed at preventing acts of violence. This  included the provision of a large number of Federal Border Guard  (BGS) officers.    In view of the possibility of violent clashes involving  Kurds  in Cologne, Mannheim, and other cities, Kanther called upon the  peaceful Kurdish population not to follow the calls of violent  Kurds. Bus companies were on no account to provide transport  for the banned PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Kanther  expressed his expectation that Germany's neighbors would prevent  Kurds clearly bent on violence from crossing the border into  Germany.    At the same time, the minister asked travelers to show  understanding for any delays caused by police measures. At  railway stations, BGS and traffic police officers were also  being asked to pick up recognized violent Kurds and prevent them  from traveling further.     "

If this does not happen in the near future, Moscow as a  subject of the Russian Federation will have to make an  independent decision, according to Luzhkov's statement published  Thursday.    In Luzhkov's opinion, the main reason impeding the ultimate  resolution of the issue is entirely obsolete legislation.    ""Today laws protect criminals and tie the hands of the  law-enforcement bodies,"" the statement runs.    In particular, Luzhkov expressed concern over the attempt  upon the chairman of board of the joint-stock company LogoVAZ,  Boris Berezovsky, on June 7 and other terrorist acts in Moscow  this week which lead to the loss of life.    Luzhkov said he had instructed the law-enforcement bodies to  use the tightest and harshest measures while investigating these  crimes.

Unlike heroic soldier Xu  Honggang who has performed magnificent feats, Jin Zhenghong has  merely done some ordinary things which many people are able to  do. However, each of these ordinary things is very touching and  shines with extraordinary splendor.    Jin Zhenghong likened himself to ""a beam of sunlight"" and  spared no effort in giving people his light and warmth. It  shows that he is a man of noble character and with a strong  sense of social responsibility. Starting with doing his own  duties properly, he really spared no effort in giving people his  light and warmth. What is particularly commendable is that  during his 12 years of active service, he continuously did good  things. He solved problems for others, mediated in disputes,  and could still contribute his share magnanimously without any  hesitation even when he was misunderstood by others, thus  enabling him to stand up to any test. It is essential to work  for ethical progress. We must upgrade the construction of  socialist spiritual civilization to a new level and rely on  everyone's concern and participation. Jin Zhenghong's good  deeds only benefited some people but their positive influence is  immeasurable. As far as the great undertaking of purifying our  social atmosphere and upgrading our morals is concerned, we  should lay special stress on the contributions made by this  ordinary soldier!    Society comprises every specific individual. Our party also  comprises every specific party member. The masses love and  support the CPC precisely because the CPC's aim is to  wholeheartedly serve the people and because tens of thousands of  CPC members are bringing their light and warmth into play.  Every citizen, and every CPC member, is required to play his  own part in improving our party style and the general mood of  society, creating good social ethics and atmosphere. Bits and  pieces of floating clouds can still be found in a clear and  boundless sky. Similarly, in our society, which is full of life  and vitality, there are also a number of unsatisfactory  phenomena in our party style and the general mood of society.  It is quite natural that people should have complaints about  this. Our Party and government attach great importance to this  problem and are taking vigorous measures to solve it. It is  necessary to rely on everybody's efforts to check and eradicate  negative and corrupt phenomena. Leading cadres, and members of  the CPC in particular, must take the initiative in this respect.  What Jin Zhenghong has said is quite true: It would be better  to kindle one's own flame first than to grumble at the poor  social atmosphere. It would be better to do concrete work than  to always bear resentment against anyone since the more doers  there are, the less bystanders we have. Whether he is aware of  it or not, everything Jin Zhenghong has done has educated and  influenced people around him, like a ""light breeze blowing in  the night which soothes things silently."" In our country, if  everyone, like Jin Zhenghong, brings his ""beam of light"" into  play, the construction of the two civilizations will advance to  a new stage, new results will be achieved, the world will be  warmer, and our society will become brighter. In this  connection, Jin Zhenghong has really set an example of how to  act as a citizen of the Republic and as a true CPC member.    We hope that more and more people in our society will follow  the example of Jin Zhenghong. We hope that the lofty spirit  presented by the deeds of Xu Honggang and Jin Zhenghong will be  carried forward so that the sky of our motherland will be filled  with warmer sunlight!     "

Impact on Small Entities         The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA). The RFA explores options for minimizing those impacts.     EPA has recently adopted a new approach to regulatory flexibility 22  for purposes of EPA's implementation of the Act, any impact is a significant impact, and any number of small entities is a substantial number. Thus, EPA will consider regulatory options for every regulation subject to the Act that can reasonably be expected to have an impact on small entities.           22     Habiicht, F. Henry II, Deputy Administrator, Internal EPA Memorandum, ``Revised Guidelines for Implementing the Regulatory Flexibility Act,'' April 9, 1992.         Therefore, in light of this new approach, EPA has determined that this rule will have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. As a result, EPA has tailored this rule to minimize the cost burdens imposed on smaller engine manufacturers.     The proposed regulations contain certification requirements for new engines, in-use testing requirements for controlled engines, Selective Enforcement Auditing provisions for the testing of production engines, and prohibitions on incorrect engine use for equipment manufacturers.     The certification program has been structured in this proposal such that all manufacturers may take advantage of a more simplified certification process than that currently mandated in the on-highway program. Testing requirements for test engines are reduced. The application and certification process is more straightforward.     The in-use testing program is structured such that manufacturers with lower annual production volumes have a lower minimum number of engines which must be tested. This places the burden of the in-use testing mostly on manufacturers with high production volumes. Provisions are also allowed for manufacturers whose number of product lines are limited. Also, manufacturers with very low production volumes are allowed maximum flexibility in procuring engines to be tested. Refer to ``IV.C.10. In-use Testing Program'' for a more detailed discussion.     The SEA program is structured such that the annual limit on the number of SEA's that EPA may perform is lower for manufacturers with lower projected annual production. Additionally, manufacturers with high projected annual production but fewer engine families will have a lower annual limit. Furthermore, manufacturers with low projected annual production may perform fewer audit tests per day to minimize the SEA burden on its test facilities. Refer to ``IV.C.19. Selective Enforcement Auditing Program'' for a more detailed discussion.     EPA is proposing that equipment manufacturers must correctly use engines that are certified upon implementation of these regulations. However, EPA has decided to make the use of non- certified engines for United States-marketed equipment a prohibited act rather than requiring equipment manufacturers to report to EPA that they are using certified engines in their equipment being consumed in the United States. Further, it is a prohibited act for equipment manufacturers to incorrectly use an engine certified as handheld in nonhandheld equipment marketed in the United States. EPA decided to make these provisions prohibited acts in order to reduce any potential reporting or recordkeeping burden for engine and equipment manufacturers. Manufacturers who attempt to sell equipment to the United States market which uses noncertified engines or uses handheld engines in nonhandheld equipment will be voluntarily reported to EPA by their competitors. EPA has proposed stiff fines on prohibited acts. Competition should effectively police these prohibited acts as competitors have a competitive incentive to make sure that no equipment manufacturer is dumping equipment with lower cost, unlawful, noncertified, or incorrectly used engines (that is, the use of a handheld engine in nonhandheld equipment) into the U.S. market.     EPA considered, but rejected, the notion of exempting small manufacturers from enforcement programs or from the regulation entirely. A more proportionate sharing of cost burden was deemed appropriate. The pollution emitted by each of these engines not only contributes to ambient air quality problems but also has health impacts on the user of the equipment who is in close proximity to the exhaust emissions.

Selective Enforcement Auditing Program'' for a more detailed discussion.     EPA is proposing that equipment manufacturers must correctly use engines that are certified upon implementation of these regulations. However, EPA has decided to make the use of non- certified engines for United States-marketed equipment a prohibited act rather than requiring equipment manufacturers to report to EPA that they are using certified engines in their equipment being consumed in the United States. Further, it is a prohibited act for equipment manufacturers to incorrectly use an engine certified as handheld in nonhandheld equipment marketed in the United States. EPA decided to make these provisions prohibited acts in order to reduce any potential reporting or recordkeeping burden for engine and equipment manufacturers. Manufacturers who attempt to sell equipment to the United States market which uses noncertified engines or uses handheld engines in nonhandheld equipment will be voluntarily reported to EPA by their competitors. EPA has proposed stiff fines on prohibited acts. Competition should effectively police these prohibited acts as competitors have a competitive incentive to make sure that no equipment manufacturer is dumping equipment with lower cost, unlawful, noncertified, or incorrectly used engines (that is, the use of a handheld engine in nonhandheld equipment) into the U.S. market.     EPA considered, but rejected, the notion of exempting small manufacturers from enforcement programs or from the regulation entirely. A more proportionate sharing of cost burden was deemed appropriate. The pollution emitted by each of these engines not only contributes to ambient air quality problems but also has health impacts on the user of the equipment who is in close proximity to the exhaust emissions. See ``VI. Environmental Benefit Assessment'' for a discussion of the health impacts of the related exhaust pollutants.

For tourism to be successful, it has to be managed by an  economist. Those who hold this opinion are justified, especially  since Dr. al-Biltaji has assumed responsibility of the Ministry  of Tourism after one of the most successful ministers of Dr.  'Atif Sidqi's cabinet, namely Minister Fu'ad Sultan who was able  to realize for Egypt a revenue of $2.5 billion from tourism in  1992. Minister Sultan encouraged the private sector to invest in  tourism, thus giving it a great boost. He was also the first man  to call for specialization in the tourism sector. Sultan is a  well-known banker who is acknowledged for his capability.    What many do not know is that the new minister of tourism  has  a doctorate in economics and another in political science. With  his experience in information, Dr. al-Biltaji has mastered the  art of dealing with domestic and foreign media people as a  result of long years of work (17 years) that have tied him to  these people. Such a man is needed now, especially since  Egyptian tourism is experiencing a deep crisis that has reduced  tourism revenues from $2.5 billion to $2.1 billion. This crisis  has resulted from the terrorist acts that have been perpetrated  in Egypt. The Western media has played a major role in  exaggerating these acts. As a consequence, tourism firms have  excluded Egypt from their program for this year. However, there  is an $42-million plan to make up for these losses, according to  Dr. al-Biltaji. Following is the text of the interview:    [Shalash] Since you assumed responsibility of the Egyptian  Ministry of Tourism, you have been declaring that this ministry  seeks to turn tourism into the locomotive pulling Egypt's  development and that you will enhance tourism, which has been in  a crisis as a result of two consecutive blows: the Kuwait  liberation war and the terrorist acts of the fall and winter of  1992--acts which persist to this day. So, how do you envision  accomplishing these goals, and how will tourism become the  development locomotive in a country with a population of 60  million people?    [al-Biltaji] When I said that tourism is the locomotive that  pulls development in Egypt, I was fully aware of what I was  saying. I still say the same thing and I work for its  implementation. I mean by this that tourism isn't just a  railroad car in the development train but the locomotive that  pulls the entire train, without replacing any of its cars. The  foreign currency revenue basket is supplied by three elements,  namely: the Suez Canal, remittances from expatriate workers, and  tourism. Tourism possesses characteristics that make it eligible  to outdistance and surpass other small elements of foreign  revenue, because tourism is an immediately exportable product.  Consequently, the element of time is, in this case, immediately  embodied economically and financially. In other words, I can  export tourism immediately, because the product is ready. This  is the first thing.    Second, tourism, remittances from expatriate Egyptians, Suez  Canal revenues, and oil revenues constitute altogether the four  elements of which the big-four assembly consists. The difference  is that tourism is not depletable, has no ceiling, and isn't  susceptible to labor market fluctuations.    Third, tourism is a labor-intensive industry, meaning that  one tourist creates work opportunities for 1.7 citizens. There  is also the so-called tourism multiplier. This multiplier is a  very large group of industries and crafts that develop and grow  the more active tourism becomes.    Tourism isn't just hotels, restaurants, airplane tickets,  and  buses, but also an integrated number of industries: moquette,  rugs, chinaware, bed covers, tables, spare parts, soap, and  detergents. This means laborers, carpenters, boatmen, smelters,  plumbers, machinists, drivers, cooks, and employees.    [Shalash] What are the true losses that have emanated from  the crisis Egyptian tourism is experiencing?    [al-Biltaji] Last year, 1993, we lost $1.5 billion. In 1992,  revenues were $2.5 billion. Perhaps the serious nature of the  terrorist acts and their reverberations in the Western media  have intensified the crisis of Egyptian tourism and resulted in  a big drop in the demand for Egyptian tourist sites. This crisis  has motivated some tour organizers and international tourist  firms to exclude Egypt from their marketing programs. If demand  continues to be low, Egypt will continue to be excluded from  international marketing programs (group tours), and this would  harbor serious harbingers of future demand, and even of future  investment in the Egyptian tourism sector. Subsequently, the  other sectors tied to the tourism sector, such as vocational,  industrial, commercial, and banking activities, will also be  affected.    [Shalash] What is your plan to boost tourism in the coming  phase under the canopy of attacks that continue to be committed  against tourists in Upper Egypt?    [al-Biltaji] Terrorist acts against tourists are few if  compared with other countries where similar incidents occur. To  date, only three tourists have been hurt. I blame the Western  media, but not all of them, for the way they describe the  incidents. I have actually met with foreign reporters in Egypt  and explained to them the dimensions of what has happened. There  is a demand on the international media to make the scoop and to  be the front runner in reporting developments. If information  isn't supplied to the media, they will gather it from any source  that may misinterpret the information and may misdirect it.  Every media person has an urgent need for information, and one  can either provide him with the information or he will gather it  any way he can.    The plan to boost tourism that we have drafted for 1994 is  based on increasing demand and on promoting the investment and  development opportunities in our tourist areas. The plan also  offers projects in these area to likely investors all over the  world, meaning that it promotes the demand side and exerts  efforts for the supply side in the tourism equation. The plan  devotes concerted attention to boosting demand in six major  international markets that export tourists to Egypt, namely the  United States, Germany, Italy, France, and Japan [no sixth  market mentioned].    [Shalash] What is this plan's total budget?    [al-Biltaji] It is estimated at $42 million.    [Shalash] How will this sum be secured?    [al-Biltaji] From the state's public treasury, the Tourism  Fund, and the private tourism sector. The government has  actually agreed to supply the full sum, and implementation of  the plan has already started. By the end of 1994, the plan seeks  to achieve the peak revenue of 1992, i.e., $2.1 billion instead  of the $1.3 billion achieved in 1993.    [Shalash] What will be the focus of activity in the targeted  markets?    [al-Biltaji] To amend Egypt's image; to put terrorist acts  within their correct context and dimensions; to appeal to the  consumer directly through television and through specialized and  unspecialized major press and news agencies; to strengthen the  bond with conventional channels of distribution, such as tour  organizers, travel agents, incentive-offering houses, conference  organizers, and airline associations and companies; to enhance  the standard of materials used to boost sales; to implement a  program to market the Egyptian tourist product; to utilize the  system of tourist convoys; to participate in international  conferences; to draft a well-studied program to invite leaders  in the field of tourism; and to establish a mechanism for  periodic followup.    [Shalash] Where does Arab tourism fall on the Egyptian  tourism-boosting map? Has Arab tourism been affected by the  latest terrorist acts, and has the Arab media performed the same  role performed by some Western media?    [al-Biltaji] The Arab market has its special characteristic  and it is an important market in exporting tourists to Egypt.  The plan takes into account the need to exert concerted efforts  in this market, using the proper instruments, such as tourist  convoys and host programs. The plan also takes into account  intensified contacts with official and professional circles and  increased reliance on the satellite television channel and on  Egyptian radio and press. At the same time, the plan disregards  some high-cost promotion instruments, such as television  commercials, press advertisements, and tourism-promotion  offices. This is why we have decided to shut down the Egyptian  Tourism Office in Kuwait.    Arab tourism to Egypt represents 40 percent of the  international tourist traffic coming into our country. The  effect on Arab tourism has been slight when compared to the drop  in other markets.    The Egyptian minister asserted that the importance of Arab  tourism to Egypt surpasses economic and social considerations.  Tourism is a main element that bolsters solidarity and  understanding, and ""we urge Egyptian citizens to go for tourism  in the Arab countries, because an Arab tourist in Egypt and an  Egyptian tourist in the Arab world is a citizen primarily. An  Arab tourist in Egypt is a first-class citizen and a tourist who  comes to his history and his environment and who deals with a  society that favors and welcomes him.    As for the Arab media, they have been committed to the truth  since the start of the terrorist acts, except for a few. I meet  with Arab reporters in Cairo, and I have been tied to them by  good relations, since I was head of the Information Authority  throughout recent years.    [Shalash] You have signed an agreement with Israel and  Turkey  to establish the East Mediterranean Tourism Organization. But  there are fears that Israel will deal a blow to Egyptian tourism  in particular. Fears abound these days among ordinary Egyptians  that Israel has had a role in the latest developments [terrorist  acts], especially since the success of ASTA [American Society of  Travel Agents] 1992 and Egypt's excellent rise on the world's  tourism map have disturbed many of the region's tourist  countries?    [al-Biltaji] There is absolutely no fear of cooperation with  Israel in this regard, because Egypt's tourism resources are  unrivaled. Egypt possesses one-third of the world's antiquities,  and it possesses natural elements, such as sun, air, shores, and  hospitable people, that are rarely found in another country.    [Shalash] What is tourism's position in the political  leadership's mind?    [al-Biltaji] President Mubarak devotes great attention to  tourism, and he goes personally to tourist sites in Luxor and  the Red Sea to encourage greatly tourism investors visiting  Egypt.    [Shalash] Tourism development activity in new tourist sites  was at the peak of success prior to 1993. Has investment and  development activity declined by the same degree as tourist  numbers and tourism revenues?    [al-Biltaji] Investment activity hasn't been affected by the  latest developments. The government has issued a number of laws  and regulations that ensure that the wheel of development keeps  on turning and that encourage the private sector to participate  effectively in this area. Incentives include free foreign  exchange transactions and unrestricted remittance of profits to  the outside world; the right of non-Egyptians to fully own  investment projects; tax exemptions for profits emanating from  tourist project expansions; and exemption from the proportionate  revenue tax, from registration, documentation, and announcement  fees for all contracts connected with the project. The  incentives also include the levying of a uniform customs fee  amounting to 5 percent of the value of goods and equipment  imported for a project. Moreover, the incentives make it  impermissible to seize or confiscate the assets of investment  firms and give these firms the right to re-export their full  capital.    The above incentives come on top of other facilities, such  as  sale and lease to investors at token prices, the investor's  freedom to determine the price of his services and his profits  without intervention by the government, and the easy and prompt  acquisition of approvals and permits for tourist projects.    [Shalash] The Ministry of Aviation has been separated from  the Ministry of Tourism in the latest Cabinet. The Civil  Aviation Authority has been placed under the control of the  Ministry of Transport; Cairo Airport and Air Egypt have been  placed under Cabinet control. Moreover, tourist companies and  hotels have, under the canopy of the new specialization laws,  been placed under the control of the public business sector.  Will this result in lack of coordination between these sectors,  even though they all serve the same thing, namely tourism, or is  there coordination among you?    [al-Biltaji] Coordination is extant and ongoing. We all  cooperate for what is in the interest of Egypt and its  prosperity. When a problem develops, we do actually form a joint  aviation-tourism committee to examine it.    [Shalash] Give me an example.    [al-Biltaji] There is the ""chartered"" flights problem that  developed recently when the Civil Aviation Authority refused to  permit tourist-carrying ""chartered"" flights to land in  al-Ghardaqah on the grounds that laws don't empower it to permit  such landings. I intervened immediately and the flights were  permitted to land because the interest of tourism comes first.  The committee we formed of the Ministry of Tourism, the Aviation  Authority, and Air Egypt drafted rules to regulate ""chartered""  flight activity in a way that ensures the national company's  right, i.e., Air Egypt's right, and the rights of the Egyptian  and foreign private sector companies. I believe in the policy of  open skies.    [Shalash] It seems from this interview that you are more  optimistic than you should.    [al-Biltaji] Yes, I am optimistic. Egyptian tourism activity  will regain its normal rates soon.     "

0,FT942-6459 ,"FT942-6459 _AN-EE3BUAEAFT 940530   FT  30 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Fresh challenge for users of derivatives - Risk and Reward      By LAURIE MORSE   Just as the world's bank and financial regulators are making a heroic effort to adapt to the new challenges posed by interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives, the world's bankers and broker-dealers are in the process of taking high-tech risk management to another level. Derivatives, particularly the plain-vanilla type of interest rate swaps and options that help mitigate market risk, have become standard tools of treasury management. Once viewed as exotic, they have achieved widespread acceptance, a point underscored last week when Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, asked Congress not to single out derivatives for regulatory reform. Now, financiers are taking the applications of options and derivatives technology they've used to harness interest rate risk and applying them to to another broad area of institutional exposure: credit risk. Managing credit risk has long been the purview of bankers and provided the bread and butter of credit rating agencies. Transfering, or trading the credit risks of a particular instrument or portfolio has, until recently, been difficult or impossible. Managing credit risk required a banker to deal directly with the the cash instrument in question. Now, derivatives experts say transferring credit risk can be as easy as transferring interest rate risk, using tailored instruments written by the likes of Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust and Credit Suisse First Boston. As with interest rate derivatives, these credit risk transfer instruments break down the various aspects of credit risk, repackage them, and make them available for an offsetting trade. If a banker has exposure to senior corporate loans with relatively high yield and high credit risk, Merrill Lynch might offer a choice of three derivatives strategies to manage that risk, says Mr Joseph Arigilagos, head of the firm's investor strategies and credit derivatives group. 'We might write a put option on the price of the debt, or an option on the credit spread between the yield on the loans and a Treasury instrument. It's even possible we could write options on the default risk of the loans,' he says. The options would insulate the banker if the credit risk of the loans rose, while still allowing him to keep the loans and collect the higher yield. Having written the specialised options, Merrill Lynch would reach into its global network of corporate credit dealings and perform trades that would offset its exposure to the deal. These strategies and others are being used to manage credit risks for LDC loans, low-grade bank loans, and junk bond portfolios. As do other derivatives, credit derivatives increase leveraged exposure, in this case to high-yielding debt. The strategies assume that for every person or company that has a natural credit exposure to be managed, there is another party willing to assume that credit risk in return for higher yield. The year-old move into credit derivatives has hardly been a calvary charge, but the bankers who are enthusiastically backing the new products predict that the credit-risk management business could boom into a Dollars 1,000bn market in a matter of years. Some of their early attempts at credit derivatives marketing backfired when an early strategy - repackaging low-grade debt into trust securities that were reissued as top-rated but high-yielding bonds - ran afoul of Standard and Poor's. The credit ratings agency insisted the rating of the credit derivative be linked to the ratings of the component junk bonds, and not to the rating of the derivative issuer.

0,FT942-13331 ,"FT942-13331 _AN-EDZEDABJFT 940426   FT  26 APR 94 / South African Elections (April 26-28): Bombs bring white rule to bloody end - The last-minute threat from the far right to South Africa's polling process      By PATTI WALDMEIR   Car bombs in South African cities; explosions at polling stations; racist attacks on black commuters: it was all depressingly predictable. The white right always said it would disrupt the all-race elections which begin today, and they have done so, quite spectacularly. Television footage of disembodied limbs littering the pavement of white areas such as Germiston, a dormitory town east of Johannesburg, will amply make the point that the far right considers this an illegitimate election. They do not want blacks to vote and thereby end 350 years of white hegemony, and they will try to frighten as many blacks as possible away from the polls. So reports of the demise of the right - which became the conventional wisdom after armed whites were routed from the black 'homeland' Bophuthatswana last month - were premature. But no one knows, even after the events of the past two days, how serious is the right-wing threat, either in the short or the medium term. The most immediate and concrete threat is to the voting itself: figures from the Pretoria-based Human Sciences Research Council show that large numbers of voters will not go to the polls if they expect violence: 19 per cent of whites and mixed-race 'coloureds' and a startling 40 per cent of Indians say they will stay away if there is a perceived threat of injury. Ironically, blacks appear less likely to abstain because of violence: polls show only 12 per cent would stay away, probably because these voters are far more inured to violence in their daily lives than whites. According to Professor Lawrence Schlemmer, the director of the HSRC, the effect on the election result could be 'dramatic'. He believes the right-wing bombings pose a far greater threat to the poll than violence between rival black groups, primarily the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom party. Fighting between those groups tends to be localised, and could prevent voting only in specific areas, whereas the white right wing is distributed throughout South Africa and could disrupt voting at many points. 'The bombings will have a blanket effect on all the people who will have to cast their votes in cosmopolitan areas,' he says. Ironically, he notes, the party most likely to benefit would be the ANC, because its supporters, mainly blacks, are less likely to be frightened away from the polls. The biggest loser would be the National party, whose voters from the minority white, coloured and Indian groups are more timid. Still, there is no question but that the poll will go ahead, and that the violent boycotters are too few to throw any doubt on the legitimacy of the election. Indeed, South African markets seemed to take the whole episode in their stride, rising despite the bomb deaths on the principle that right-wing violence was only to be expected, and was nowhere near the threat to long-term stability posed by, for example, the Inkatha election boycott narrowly averted last week. Inkatha's decision to participate in elections largely put paid to nightmare situations of joint resistance by the white and black right, and no amount of bombs can change that. And even among the white right, the divisions are deep and damaging, undermining the white right's ability to pose a credible long-term threat. For the bombers have found themselves increasingly isolated from the broad mass of South Africans, across the political spectrum, and this deprives them of a supportive political atmosphere in which to operate. Since the decision last month by Gen Constand Viljoen, the right-wing leader of the Freedom Front, to participate in today's poll, the case for violent struggle has been much diminished. Afrikaners now have an electoral outlet for their fears and a constitutional means of demonstrating their demand for a volkstaat or homeland - by voting for Gen Viljoen's Freedom Front. Votes for this party are due to be counted separately to gauge support for a volkstaat. Much will depend on the share of the vote gained by the Freedom Front in the next three days of voting: if Gen Viljoen can score the 700,000-odd votes which he expects, this will further undermine support for violence. Still, no one really knows how many trained military men the white right could count on for further resistance. There are literally hundreds of lunatic cells of right-wingers throughout the country, and they have access to commercial explosives from the mines, where many are employed, and possibly to arms from state armouries (where sympathisers are employed) for further sabotage. Among the various part-time, locally-based forces and reservists, which total up to 450,000 men, right-wing support is unclear. But the top ranks of the South African Defence Force remain committed to the new government, which can be expected to act far more harshly against the right than the present government. And there is no reason to believe that the counter-insurgency tactics of the SADF, which worked so well against Umkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC's military wing, would be any less effective against the white right. And in any case, it takes more than a few vicious acts of terrorism - or even many vicious acts of terrorism - to make a civil war. Without the participation in such acts of the black right, in the form of Inkatha, it is almost impossible to predict a conflict in which the integrity of the South African state is seriously affected, and many people die. The real risk would be if Inkatha were also to reject the outcome of the election, and were to team up again with the right wing afterwards. That truly would be a scenario too ghastly to contemplate. With any luck, it will be avoided.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.     P8651 Political Organizations.

0,FT933-12256 ,"FT933-12256 _AN-DGYABAE8FT 930724   FT  24 JUL 93 / Arts: Aix proves bankrupt of ideas      By RICHARD FAIRMAN   AS RECESSION bites in France, it is likely that the arts will face a difficult few years. There is a rumour that the Aix-en-Provence festival is uncertain how far its formerly secure patronage will be maintained next year. Unfortunately its fund of artistic inventiveness inconveniently seems to be running out at the same time. Of this year's three operas, two were intellectually bankrupt. The more important failure was Weber's Euryanthe, which always seems to be unlucky in the theatre. The opera is the very archetype of the early-romantic German lyric drama, an idealised vision of medieval chivalry, told in vivid musical narrative. There is no obvious reason why its spirit should be difficult to convey, although one might not have thought so from ENO's drab production in the 1970s. This effort at Aix was worse. For an evening of visual ghastliness it could hardly be surpassed. Forget romantic forests, rocky gorges, castle halls. For the opening scene the only prop was an enormous spiked ball hanging from the ceiling of a grey hall. The women of the chorus wore a variety of designer flowerpots on their heads; the men stood around in hang-dog fashion dressed as medieval oafs. When a group of girls in flimsy blue bikinis fluttered on, they seemed quite uninterested. Everything was enervated, gloomy, ugly. The producer of this sorry enterprise was Hans Peter Cloos, the designer Jean Haas. The extent of their combined ingenuity can be judged from the heroic battle in Act 3. In a wild ravine (empty stage, low lighting) Adolar is supposed to face a monster in combat. Insteaed he sits motionless on an empty stage, while his adversary turns out to be a woman who appears in a puff of dry ice on a platform way out of reach - poor girl, this was her second role of the festival, in the nude again, but now bald as well] For the stage-wise singer, ready to seize an opportunity, the production offered an open door. Karen Huffstodt, as the evil Eglantine, duly took it, staking her claim to the most dramatic role of the opera with a portrayal of Hollywood bad-girl glamour, school of Bette Davis, accompanied by singing of the fearsome vocal part that was confident and abandoned. She stole the show. In an interesting contrast, her partner-in-crime Lysiart was played by Andreas Schmidt, whose impeccably-moulded singing made inward all that she externalised so forcibly. Once past the ungratefully-written opening aria, Thomas Moser's Adolar was strong and secure. Elisabeth Meyer-Topsoe was an able, not very moving Euryanthe. Jeffrey Tate conducted what seemed an undersized English Chamber Orchestra, unable to give the music sufficient punch in this open-air venue. The opera should be seen to be the forerunner of Wagner's grand music dramas. Here it merely seemed to be as long as one.                           *       *       * Just a note on Don Giovanni. This was officially a revival, although in practice the original production last year had been judged such a disaster that the producer, Giorgio Marini, was asked to re-think from scratch. To anyone coming to this staging for the first time, it was difficult to see what his re-thinking had entailed. Or, indeed, if any thinking had taken place at all. Mozart described Don Giovanni as a 'dramma giocoso', but neither drama nor comedy was to be divined either from the stage action, or from Armin Jordan's stylish, but undramatic conducting. Once again, individual singers were left to put across their own performances with success, where they could. Hillevi Martinpelto as Donna Anna and John Mark Ainsley as Don Ottavio won the audience's enthusiastic approval, a view with which I would not take issue. Deborah Riedel stood in bravely as Donna Elvira at short notice. But this was not a Don Giovanni of festival standard.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     FRZ  France, EC.

Ham Myong-chol, the Foreign Ministry's director-general for  international organizations, said the government's regret was  contained in a message it delivered to the Amnesty International  through the Korean Embassy in London.    The government pointed out in the letter it was not  desirable  that AI published such a report at a time when follow-up  measures were being taken in the country to better institute the  democratic system.    ""It seems that AI was not fully aware of the new  government's  democratization policies and that it observed Korea's human  rights conditions from the past's biased point of view,"" Ham  said.    He said it was especially regrettable that AI prepared the  report based only on the statements by those involved and their  families.    The official said the instances cited in the report were  cases of actual law violations such as espionage activities.

The letters are separate from the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO providing for Palestinian self-rule which is to be signed in Washington on Monday: From Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, to Mr Yitzhak Rabin: Mr Prime Minister, The signing of the Declaration of Principles marks a new era in the history of the Middle East. In firm conviction thereof I would like to confirm the following PLO commitments: The PLO recognises the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security. The PLO accepts United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The PLO commits itself to the Middle East peace process, and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two sides and declares that all outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations. The PLO considers that the signing of the Declaration of Principles constitutes an historic event, inaugurating a new epoch of peaceful co-existence, free from violence and all other acts which endanger peace and stability. Accordingly, the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements and personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent violations and discipline violators. In view of the promise of a new era and the signing of the Declaration of Principles and based on Palestinian acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid. Consequently, the PLO undertakes to submit to the Palestinian National Council for formal approval the necessary changes in regard to the Palestinian Covenant. Sincerely, Yassir Arafat, chairman, Palestine Liberation Organisation. From Mr Rabin to Mr Arafat: Mr Chairman, In response to your letter of September 9th 1993 I wish to confirm to you that, in light of the PLO commitments included in your letter, the government of Israel has decided to recognise the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people and commence negotiations with the PLO within the Middle East peace process. Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister of Israel. From Mr Arafat to Mr Johan Joergen Holst, Norwegian foreign minister: I would like to confirm to you that, upon signing of the Declaration of Principles, I will include the following positions in my public statements: In light of the new era marked by the signing of the Declaration of Principles, the PLO encourages and calls upon the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to take part in the steps leading to the normalisation of life, rejecting violence and terrorism, contributing to peace and stability and participating actively in the shaping of reconstruction, economic development and co-operation.

Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said that violating the rights of others,  resorting to violence, and undermining the principle of  cooperation and assistance are grave indications that harm the  Palestinian people's unity and cohesion.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi held the Israeli authorities responsible  for the disorder and chaos among Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,  especially the spread of weapons in the streets, which reach the  hands of adolescents and irresponsible individuals. He added  that in accordance with international law, Israel, as an  occupying country, is obligated to protect Palestinian residents  and care for their safety.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: In light of this situation, for  which everyone knows Israel is responsible, the Palestinians  should rally around their unity and avoid infighting, which does  not serve the Palestinian people.

As such, the  Army is the party to which our Yemeni masses naturally turn when  they seek to hasten the inevitable end of the cheap separatists'  saga, led by the war criminal 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his  renegade, perfidious gang.    That hope is reflected by the worthy citizens in our  southern  governorates rallying behind the army of legality, democracy,  and unity. That all-important moral support has enabled our  valiant Army to fulfill its patriotic duties with remarkable  success and efficiency and score successive victories over the  forces of apostasy and secession and pursue the sacred advance  on the remnants of apostasy, perfidy, and treachery.    The unsavory rumors spread by the gang of secession within  the Socialist Party about the army of legality, unity, and  democracy furnish eloquent proof of the panic with which it  reacted to the support the victorious Republic of Yemen's  military enjoys with the public. It is not surprising that our  great Yemeni people should stand shoulder to shoulder with the  courageous protectors of the homeland as they defend the  sanctities of the Yemeni homeland. Just as the Yemeni people  displayed exemplary sacrifice in defeating their enemy in  conjunction with the military, they are now striving to rout the  remnants of the enemies of legality, unity, and democracy.    This courageous pro-Army and pro-unity posture on the part  of  our determined people has dealt a stinging blow to the gang of  apostasy and secession. It was natural that the people should  take such a stand, given the gang's criminal bloody record.    Certain facts have now come to light and may be summed up as  follows:    The personnel of the Republic of Yemen's military, now  engaging the secessionist gang in battle for the cause of  legality and unity and democracy, hail from all the Republic's  governorates, without exception. Thus, every inch of Yemeni  territory is a trust held by all members of the Armed Forces. A  Yemeni views every Yemeni drop of blood that runs through the  veins of fellow Yemenis as if it were his own.    The Republic of Yemen's military has earned the support of  the entire population of the country by its loyalty to God, the  homeland, the revolution, and unity.    Our enlightened and vigilant people are now certain that the  leaders of secession in the Socialist Party stage-managed the  crisis to advance their goal of scuttling the union of the  country and then reinstating their terrible, totalitarian regime  in the south.    Monitoring the evolving crisis from the beginning, Yemenis  are now certain beyond a shadow of doubt that the secessionist  gang had been planning for secession for quite some time.  Toward that end, they had detached some military units from the  Army of the Yemeni Republic. With their rallying cries of power  or death, secession or war, they had also stacked weapons and  military hardware in homes and warehouses and even with some  street hawkers.    That was enough [word indistinct] all people with their  heroic Army that has proved its true affiliation to a united  Yemen, thus haunting the secessionists, who are now spreading  ludicrous rumors to undercut the cohesion between the people and  the Army as they push ahead with the firmness of believers to  uphold the cause of unity, democracy, and legality and hunt down  the adventurous killers -- the gang of apostasy and secession,  who are now having to endure the disgrace of defeat. Yemen's  unity shall remain a crown on the heads of our worthy citizens  and their victorious army, God willing.     "

Mobidem, as it is called, weighs less than one pound and can be connected to any PC with a standard serial port. It then transmits data at the rate of 8 kilobits per second over the Mobitex packet-switched data network operated in the US by Ram Mobile Data and in Canada by Rogers Cantel. This eliminates the need for PC users to find a phone socket in which to plug their 'wireline' modems.

STEBEL (WALKER & CO.: $17.95; 236 PP.)      By Judith Freeman, Freeman is the author of Family Attractions (stories) and  The Chinchilla Farm, a novel to be published by W. W. Norton in October.      When I was little more than a child my imagination was caught by a book called  ""Alone,"" written by Adm. Richard E. Byrd. Published in 1938, it's the  reflective and ultimately spiritual journal Byrd kept during a solo expedition  to gather meteorological data in the region of the South Pole.    For five months, Byrd lived alone in a shack sunk in the ice with temperatures  reaching minus 50 and 60 degrees. Each day he emerged through a trap door to  read his instruments above ground, also noting the look of things in the polar  winter (""storm-blue bulge of darkness . . ."") he was experiencing, and in which  he almost perished. He came to believe that ""such beauty was reserved for  distant and dangerous places"" which ""extract a price from those who would  witness it.""    Two or three writers since have succeeded in conjuring up that polar beauty for  me again -- Ursula K. Le Guin in a brilliant story called ""Sur,"" and Doris  Lessing in the fourth of the ""Canopus in Argos"" books, ""The Making of a  Representative for Planet 8."" Now I would add S. L. Stebel's evocatively  ice-bound novel, a book of winning beauty and mythology, ""Spring Thaw,"" which  is set on a ship near an island in the region of the North Pole.    The story revolves around an expedition of seal hunters, who set out in a ship  called the Seljegeren for the annual harvest of seal pelts. The Seljegeren's  old captain is ailing and his son, Jason, from whom he is estranged, assumes  command of the ship. The sailor-hunters are anxious for the kill, their annual  livelihood depends on it, and already, other ships are taking up the best  waters. During a fierce storm at sea, Jason stumbles across an old chart in his  father's cabin, and against the advice of the more experienced of his crew,  heads for a cluster of islands called the Mirabelles, where a quick and  bountiful harvest is hoped for.    The ship anchors off the Mirabelles, ice encroaching and threatening to freeze  it in place. A sullen, defeated population greets them hastily, dark and heavy  villagers slogging across the ice like medieval Grendels wary of the stranger  in the mead hall, a broken people who no longer even hunt their own abundant  seals. Some force seems to protect the seals from being killed, as the crew of  the Seljegeren discover when they attempt a slaughter and meet with  inexplicable accidents.    This is no medieval tale however. We are meant to understand that Jason has  witnessed the bombing of a marine base in Lebanon (""We lifted what was left of  once able-bodied men . . . our hands sticky with substances the mind would not  contemplate . . .""), an experience so psychologically destabilizing that he has  been relieved of command in the Navy. Is the destructive, malevolent force he  encounters in the Mirabelles the psychological residue of modern war, or a  ""spiritual visitation . . . the creation of shame-ridden mind"" in an  ecologically unbalanced world?    In time Jason discovers the truth, which is that the force protecting the seals  is a spirit-woman whom Jason's father had wronged many years ago, and with whom  he engages in a somnambulistic hearth-side fever-love. Now he asks: Is he his  father's rival, a self-deluded fool, or the inheritor of a family curse?    By the time the reader comes to the final father-son confrontation scene,  Jason, like the seeker of the Golden Fleece, has made heroic discoveries  through trial and confrontation, in a story with very modern overtones. ""Spring  Thaw"" is immensely enjoyable, a book with considerably more going for it than  its evocation of ice-bound wonder, but for this alone, I was rather grateful.

Published in 1938, it's the  reflective and ultimately spiritual journal Byrd kept during a solo expedition  to gather meteorological data in the region of the South Pole.    For five months, Byrd lived alone in a shack sunk in the ice with temperatures  reaching minus 50 and 60 degrees. Each day he emerged through a trap door to  read his instruments above ground, also noting the look of things in the polar  winter (""storm-blue bulge of darkness . . ."") he was experiencing, and in which  he almost perished. He came to believe that ""such beauty was reserved for  distant and dangerous places"" which ""extract a price from those who would  witness it.""    Two or three writers since have succeeded in conjuring up that polar beauty for  me again -- Ursula K. Le Guin in a brilliant story called ""Sur,"" and Doris  Lessing in the fourth of the ""Canopus in Argos"" books, ""The Making of a  Representative for Planet 8."" Now I would add S. L. Stebel's evocatively  ice-bound novel, a book of winning beauty and mythology, ""Spring Thaw,"" which  is set on a ship near an island in the region of the North Pole.    The story revolves around an expedition of seal hunters, who set out in a ship  called the Seljegeren for the annual harvest of seal pelts. The Seljegeren's  old captain is ailing and his son, Jason, from whom he is estranged, assumes  command of the ship. The sailor-hunters are anxious for the kill, their annual  livelihood depends on it, and already, other ships are taking up the best  waters. During a fierce storm at sea, Jason stumbles across an old chart in his  father's cabin, and against the advice of the more experienced of his crew,  heads for a cluster of islands called the Mirabelles, where a quick and  bountiful harvest is hoped for.    The ship anchors off the Mirabelles, ice encroaching and threatening to freeze  it in place. A sullen, defeated population greets them hastily, dark and heavy  villagers slogging across the ice like medieval Grendels wary of the stranger  in the mead hall, a broken people who no longer even hunt their own abundant  seals. Some force seems to protect the seals from being killed, as the crew of  the Seljegeren discover when they attempt a slaughter and meet with  inexplicable accidents.    This is no medieval tale however. We are meant to understand that Jason has  witnessed the bombing of a marine base in Lebanon (""We lifted what was left of  once able-bodied men . . . our hands sticky with substances the mind would not  contemplate . . .""), an experience so psychologically destabilizing that he has  been relieved of command in the Navy. Is the destructive, malevolent force he  encounters in the Mirabelles the psychological residue of modern war, or a  ""spiritual visitation . . . the creation of shame-ridden mind"" in an  ecologically unbalanced world?    In time Jason discovers the truth, which is that the force protecting the seals  is a spirit-woman whom Jason's father had wronged many years ago, and with whom  he engages in a somnambulistic hearth-side fever-love. Now he asks: Is he his  father's rival, a self-deluded fool, or the inheritor of a family curse?    By the time the reader comes to the final father-son confrontation scene,  Jason, like the seeker of the Golden Fleece, has made heroic discoveries  through trial and confrontation, in a story with very modern overtones. ""Spring  Thaw"" is immensely enjoyable, a book with considerably more going for it than  its evocation of ice-bound wonder, but for this alone, I was rather grateful.      Book Review    "

A spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in Ankara  on 27 June that ""Turkey is disappointed at the fact that the  demonstration was changed into an action of a terrorist  organization."" Turkey did not understand that following the ban  on the PKK in Germany, the flags of the PKK and photos of its  leader, Abdullah Ocalan, could have been shown unhindered in a  demonstration against Turkey, he said.    ""We do not want a terrorist organization to be encouraged to  carry out new acts of violence, because the ban imposed upon  them has been watered down. That is why we will lodge  complaints with German authorities in Ankara, Bonn, and  Frankfurt in the next few days,"" the spokesman said. The PKK  has for 10 years waged a guerrilla war against Turkey for an  independent Kurdistan, which has claimed more than 12,000 lives.  It is also held responsible for the increasing bomb terror in  Turkish holiday resorts.     "

Mr Yasushi Akashi of Japan also expressed concern over violations of the Paris peace agreement signed by the country's four main factions last year. He said further acts would not be tolerated. 'If there are any persistent or clear-cut violations, I'm sure the Security Council will be in a position to take a clear-cut decision of enforcement,' Mr Akashi said on his arrival in Phnom Penh. Mr Akashi said he was concerned about the 'ineffectiveness' of Cambodia's Supreme National Council which is 'supposed to be a very, very important instrument for national reconciliation to prepare for the steps of democracy in this country'. He added that he would work with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian head of state and SNC president, towards making a council which comes up to its 'promises and expectations.' The SNC holds Cambodian sovereignty ahead of UN-organised elections next year.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Blessed be the forces of unity and the army of  legitimacy, which is the shield of great, unified Yemen and the  hand flying the banner of faith and honor. Having plotted, the  apostate and secessionist forces have received the reward for  their plotting. But the plotting of evil will hem in only the  authors thereof. [Koranic verse] The gangs of apostasy and  secession have betrayed the homeland, disavowed pledges, and  violated agreements. Therefore, it was inescapable that they  receive the wrath of the God and the people and that they  receive the reward of treachery and treason from the forces of  the people and the heroic army of unity.    The people and the entire world have heard the decisions and  statements of the Yemeni leadership and the the Defense Ministry  and General Staff Command official source. Those statements  have made it clear that the renegade Socialist Party traitors  are the ones who started the fire and triggered the spark,  believing that they would be safe from its fire. They thought  there would be no trial or punishment, so they became blind and  deaf. [Koranic verse] Therefore, they are now being blazed by  the fire which they have started. The flames are devouring them  and removing their corruption and germs from the body of the  Yemeni homeland, the homeland of wisdom and faith.    The people who endured this gang's harmful abscess and  deadly  disease for a third-of-a-century, are determined to extract the  abscess, remove the tumor, and to get rid of the disease.  Toward this end, the faithful forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy are executing the will of the people.  The good news, clear indications, and ongoing events affirm  that victory will be for the people, unity, and constitutional  legitimacy. The national and international stands herald a new  upcoming dawn and tell the world that the treacherous clique  must be encircled and that it cannot escape the people's army as  it resolutely marches toward the dens of the gang, confidently  digging their rotten holes and teaching them that the gang has  no escape from the people's wrath, for it has sowed corruption  on earth, exhausted the country, shed blood, and killed innocent  souls. It has been doing so throughout its black history and  bloody rule of which the Yemeni people have been afflicted. The  tyranny of this parasitic gang, which has nothing to do with the  Yemeni people's tenets and values, has gone far beyond any  limits. Therefore, it was inevitable that it be confronted by  the people, rejected by the homeland, and that it receive its  retribution from God through His lovers and supporters in the  army of unity, constitutional legitimacy, and the forces of  unity and democracy. This is best proved by the fact that many  of the elements who have been deceived for a long time have  become aware of the lies of the gangs of apostasy and secession  and realized the falsehood of their slogans and claims. Those  national elements have joined the trench of unity and legitimacy  and voluntarily surrendered to and joined the forces of the  constitutional legitimacy. They declared their rejection of  the gangs of apostasy and stressed their rejection of all its  criminal actions. This mass capitulation and joining of our  forces is taking place at all positions, axes, and governorates.  This proves that the gangs of apostasy and secession have lost  everything. They are exposed and have lost all the rejected,  deceptive merchandise which they have been promoting among the  masses throughout the past third of a century. [passage omitted]     "

Yesterday it started proceedings against Phoenix International (Computers), UK-based subsidiary of Phoenix Computer Associates of the US. It alleges that Phoenix, a computer brokerage based in Surrey, sold memory cards - printed circuit boards bearing memory chips - as genuine IBM products, when they had, in fact, been reworked by a third party. The action follows similar moves in the US against Phoenix's parent and four other US companies. They are Comdisco, one of the world's largest computer leasing companies, and three engineering and broking companies  - Datanon, Allen-Myland and BSM Corporation.

It makes a difference to when you can see the firmament Hamlet is talking about, and here is one of the gains of watching Hamlet in the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park. With the sky above he counts himself king of infinite space; amid the theatre he might be bounded in a nutshell. The three other strengths of Tim Pigott-Smith's staging are its clarity of utterance, its concision, and its protagonist. Every word registers, even from actors who a fortnight ago were often inaudible in A Midsummer Night's Dream. The play has been cut (not only is Hamlet's address to the players gone, so is the play the players usually speak) so tautly that the audience's attention never flags. As for young Damian Lewis (just a year out of drama school) as Hamlet, everything he does has the audience firmly held. Strikingly equipped with a tide of Tudor red hair, burning blue eyes, heroic bones and good build, this Hamlet works hard to win his authority over the play, but win it he does. He speaks the lines 'with good accent and good discretion', and he has both virility and stillness. He is a Hamlet both Romantic (frozen in melancholy, vivid in action) and modern (playing at crude aperies in his 'madness', sardonically rude). He manages both to relate freshly to everyone else onstage and to suggest that Hamlet's mind is always at one remove from everyone around him. Remarkably, he achieves this by working within very narrow confines. His vocal register is seldom more than a minor third, he makes no particular play between piano and forte, he employs no great contrasts of speed during his soliloquies. Yet one attends to him. He has not yet bent the role to his will, has not relaxed within its rigours so that we trust his command of it, is still shifting in his way of addressing the audience - and yet one attends to him. One attends to his chief colleagues, but with considerable less gratitude. Ophelia (Rebecca Egan) is a pushy modern miss, Gertrude (Pamela Miles) a slow and unemotional marshmallow, Claudius (Paul Freeman) a flamboyant thespian of flashing eyes and rolling Rs, Polonius (David Collings) a tepid old trouper. Everything the last three actors do tells us, with emphatically actorish deliberation, that they are actors of the Old School - a school so old one thought it was dead. Their experience makes its effect, but I cannot believe in their characterisations for a moment. The production is set, more or less, in Georgian times: Empire-line dresses, frock coats, trousers and waistcoats. The way poor Gertrude kept hitching her skirts around told us only too clearly that the 19th century just wasn't her time; she only relaxed when put into a nightie for the closet scene. And why has the designer, Tanya McCallin, allowed Gertrude and Ophelia to wear hairdos that are so blatantly modern that they clash with their frocks? The effect is cheap - as if the Open Air Theatre could not afford wigs. But these irritations are peripheral. Hamlet is alive in Regent's Park, and Hamlet is more than promising.

""I kiss you both for the last time.""    Olga Benario, the daughter of a middle-class lawyer from Munich, thrust herself  into the most treacherous currents of revolutionary struggle.    At 14 she joined the Communist Party. She was still a teen-ager when she  liberated her lover from a German prison at gunpoint and fled to Moscow. She  was sent to South America to start a revolution. But her life ended, by a  poignant twist of fate, in a concentration camp.    Fernando Morais, Benario's self-appointed biographer, persuades us that her  hunger for adventure, her sheer force of character, her passion and courage,  called her to a strange and tragic destiny. As depicted in ""Olga,"" she was a  strong and beautiful woman, a hero in the very best sense of the word, but a  doomed hero.    The book focuses on the zenith in the arc of her life. She was dispatched by  the Comintern to Brazil in 1935 in the company of Luis Carlos Prestes, another  impossibly romantic figure who was Moscow's best hope for triggering a  revolution in Latin America. They traveled in the guise of a rich young couple,  well supplied with cash and clothing to keep up the pretense, and even managed  a sumptuous ""honeymoon"" in New York before landing by seaplane on the coast of  Brazil.    ""May 1935 be the year of revolution in Brazil,"" Prestes toasted his comrade and  lover.    As it turned out, the elaborate plot was stillborn: ""The revolution 'began' at  3 a.m.,"" Morais explains, ""and was over by 1:30 p.m. that afternoon."" The  Brazilian secret police, assisted by the Gestapo, rounded up the usual suspects  and broke them under hideous torture. Soon enough, the story of Olga Benario  turns from high-spirited revolutionary adventure to a descent into the maw of  the Holocaust.    Benario was a Jew, a Bolshevik, and a wanted criminal in Nazi Germany. The  Brazilian police did not torture her; they offered her as a gift to Adolf  Hitler. The fact that she carried the baby of a Brazilian citizen did not save  her, nor did the heroic protests of her fellow prisoners. Her heroism and  courage were put to a different test from the one for which she had prepared.    History has provided Morais with settings and incidents fit for a Hollywood  movie. Benario carries an ivory-handled revolver. The Brazilian police make  cynical use of Prestes' faithful dog to search out and identify the couple in  hiding. A police interrogator -- blond and German-speaking -- asks no questions  at all; rather, he impassively cracks and eats hazelnuts until, suddenly, he  crushes a suspect's thumb in the nutcracker. The only clue to Benario's  ultimate fate is one word on a slip of paper sewn into the hem of her skirt:  Bernburg, the site of a Nazi gas chamber.    Morais is a Brazilian journalist who now serves as minister of culture for the  province of Sao Paolo.

""I kiss you both for the last time.""    Olga Benario, the daughter of a middle-class lawyer from Munich, thrust herself  into the most treacherous currents of revolutionary struggle.    At 14 she joined the Communist Party. She was still a teen-ager when she  liberated her lover from a German prison at gunpoint and fled to Moscow. She  was sent to South America to start a revolution. But her life ended, by a  poignant twist of fate, in a concentration camp.    Fernando Morais, Benario's self-appointed biographer, persuades us that her  hunger for adventure, her sheer force of character, her passion and courage,  called her to a strange and tragic destiny. As depicted in ""Olga,"" she was a  strong and beautiful woman, a hero in the very best sense of the word, but a  doomed hero.    The book focuses on the zenith in the arc of her life. She was dispatched by  the Comintern to Brazil in 1935 in the company of Luis Carlos Prestes, another  impossibly romantic figure who was Moscow's best hope for triggering a  revolution in Latin America. They traveled in the guise of a rich young couple,  well supplied with cash and clothing to keep up the pretense, and even managed  a sumptuous ""honeymoon"" in New York before landing by seaplane on the coast of  Brazil.    ""May 1935 be the year of revolution in Brazil,"" Prestes toasted his comrade and  lover.    As it turned out, the elaborate plot was stillborn: ""The revolution 'began' at  3 a.m.,"" Morais explains, ""and was over by 1:30 p.m. that afternoon."" The  Brazilian secret police, assisted by the Gestapo, rounded up the usual suspects  and broke them under hideous torture. Soon enough, the story of Olga Benario  turns from high-spirited revolutionary adventure to a descent into the maw of  the Holocaust.    Benario was a Jew, a Bolshevik, and a wanted criminal in Nazi Germany. The  Brazilian police did not torture her; they offered her as a gift to Adolf  Hitler. The fact that she carried the baby of a Brazilian citizen did not save  her, nor did the heroic protests of her fellow prisoners. Her heroism and  courage were put to a different test from the one for which she had prepared.    History has provided Morais with settings and incidents fit for a Hollywood  movie. Benario carries an ivory-handled revolver. The Brazilian police make  cynical use of Prestes' faithful dog to search out and identify the couple in  hiding. A police interrogator -- blond and German-speaking -- asks no questions  at all; rather, he impassively cracks and eats hazelnuts until, suddenly, he  crushes a suspect's thumb in the nutcracker. The only clue to Benario's  ultimate fate is one word on a slip of paper sewn into the hem of her skirt:  Bernburg, the site of a Nazi gas chamber.    Morais is a Brazilian journalist who now serves as minister of culture for the  province of Sao Paolo. ""Olga"" is clearly his passion -- as the woman herself  was in the lives of so many other men -- and he spent years in search of her  exotic but elusive story.    Significantly, he found a rich vein of once-secret information in the National  Archives in Washington, thanks to the complicity of U.S. agents in suppressing  the Prestes conspiracy.

However, the lack of success in numerous attempts by  representatives of the Russian VPK [military-industrial complex]  to convince the other sectors of the economy of the enormous  benefit of high-tech defense and of their competitiveness in  world markets provides grounds for doubting the fundamental  possibility of accustoming VPK enterprises to a ""peacetime  situation"" and the budget deficit; yesterday, for the second  time, the Kirov plant in St. Petersburg was shut down.    After going back to work following the first shutdown and  assembling 150 tractors, the Kirov workers were unable to solve  the problem of selling them: 400 machines await their fate in  the yard at the enterprise. The plant management attributes the  lack of buyers for the Kirov tractors to the doubling in cost of  the tractors since the beginning of the year, linking this rise  to a change in the tax laws (which appears extremely doubtful to  KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts; this can justify no more than a  10-percent increase.) Due to the shutdown more than 5,000  workers have been forced to take leave without pay. The most  likely date for the renewal of production is 1 October, although  ""planted' loans by the federal government to the farmers could  stimulate demand somewhat, in which case the plant would begin  operating as of 1 April. Other, purely military assembly  subdivisions belonging to the Kirov Zavod AO [joint-stock  association]: the transmission plant, the Spetsmash plant (which  produces tanks and artillery) and the steam turbine unit (which  produces steam turbines for submarines, among other things).    The shutdown of the Kirov plant is yet another manifestation  of the already obvious economic crisis in which almost all of  the enterprises in the Russian military-industrial complex find  themselves. The overall drop in production at Petersburg defense  plants was 28.6 percent in 1993, including 38.8 percent in the  aviation industry, while indebtedness to the state by 132  military enterprises of the city reached 150 billion rubles. As  a result Petersburg has assumed 33rd place in Russia with  respect to the reduction in production volumes (Leningrad  Oblast, 67th; Moscow, 49th).    In this situation it would be logical to expect coordinated  actions from the management at the plants, local authorities and  the federal government to overcome the crisis. The plant  administration is working out plans for respecializing as a rule  oriented toward financing out of the budget, however, (papers  pertaining to a coordinated plan with the American Caterpillar  company were signed quite recently, but implementation of the  idea of producing city buses is still in the initial stage. A  recent conference showed that Anatoliy Sobchak has still not  defined his position--either to restrain the directors of the  VPK enterprises with a ""Democles sword"" or unequivocally to  support their demands (which could have a negative effect on the  attitude toward the mayor of Petersburg in Moscow). One way or  another, all of the main hopes are pinned on a solution  involving the federal budget. The end justifies the means in  this case. This will put into action the traditional lobbying  methods (the signing of demands for reduced taxes by the  directors, exemption from duties, the provision of subsidies,  the establishment of machine-tool committees and so forth), and  some now forgotten foreign economic tricks: delegations of  production veterans with Soviet orders on their lapels in  government offices. There is no doubt about the choice of the  members of the current ""government management team"": to envelop  the plant in the heroic performance of the first five-year plans  or not.     "

On 7 March JIEFANGJUN BAO  published on page one a 1,200-character editorial entitled  ""Tremendous Encouragement, Powerful Push,"" along with the  handwritten inscriptions of Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Liu Huaqing,  and Zhang Zhen, calling on people to learn from Xu Honggang.    The 23 February article entitled ""What Should We Learn From  Heroes?"" urged all Army personnel to emulate Xu Honggang's  loyalty to the party, the motherland, and the people. It also  called on them to emulate his outstanding political dedication  to the Army's and the state's modernization, his spirit of  carrying forward the party's and Army's fine traditions, serving  the people wholeheartedly, and sacrificing for all the people's  interests. It stated that all Army personnel should adopt his  moral concepts of constantly forging ahead, cherishing the Army  and mastering military skills, scrupulously performing his  duties well, earnestly practicing what he advocates, his strong  sense of responsibility, and his heroic spirit of having the  courage to do what is right and make sacrifices and dashing  forward to lend a helping hand when there are difficulties.    The 24 February article entitled ""Set an Example of Lofty  Life"" called on young people to learn from heroes, take the path  of maturity which heroes have charted, and strive to become  people who have lofty ideals, moral integrity, education, and a  sense of discipline. The article criticized some young people  who are influenced by money worship, hedonism, and egoism for  admiring and favoring ""yuan millionaires [da kuan 1129 2949]""  and taking delight in talking about singers and film stars while  not having due interest in heroes.    The 25 February article entitled ""Educate New People With  Fine Traditions"" quoted Chairman Jiang Zemin as saying that Xu  Honggang's deeds embodied the Communist Party's tradition, the  old Red Army's tradition, the tradition of the Army cherishing  the people and the latter supporting the former, and the Chinese  nation's traditional virtue. To educate new people with fine  traditions, the commentator pointed out, it is necessary to know  and master the fine traditions, grasp their core and essence,  put them into practice, and pass them down, generation after  generation. The article urged party committees and political  offices of all troops to effectively carry out the work of  creating more socialist people like Xu Honggang.    The 26 February article entitled ""Temper Oneself Into Steel""  encouraged all Army comrades to foster lofty ideals, a firm  conviction, and a correct outlook on life and value. It urged  Army comrades to temper themselves in their own jobs, in  military training, and in mastery of scientific theory, and to  strive to become qualified military personnel.    The 27 February article entitled ""Let Us Sing the Song of  Unrighteousness"" pointed out that the Army shoulders a heavy  responsibility in safeguarding national security and social  stability and that all comrades in the Army must have the  courage to do what is right, regardless of the consequences, in  wiping out various ugly social phenomena and evil forces and  safeguarding social stability.    On 7 March JIEFANGJUN BAO published an editorial, along with  handwritten inscriptions by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Liu Huaqing,  and Chang Zhen on emulating Xu Honggang, calling the  inscriptions high praise for Comrade Xu Honggang, a tremendous  encouragement to officers and men of the whole Army, and a  powerful push in the vigorous drive to learn from Xu Honggang.  The editorial called on all Army comrades to conscientiously  respond to the call of the CPC Central Committee and the Central  Military Commission to emulate Xu Honggang with greater  enthusiasm, shape a glorious life with lofty ideals, strive to  be military personnel who have lofty ideals, moral integrity,  education, and a sense of discipline, make brilliant  achievements, and usher in the 21th century with a completely  new ideological outlook.

The decision was made at the peak of police wrath at foreign  correspondents. A week ago, the Interior Ministry summoned the  AFP bureau chief and reproached him for circulating inaccurate  reports. He was accused of hostility to Egypt and threatened  with expulsion.    AL-SHA'B has learned that the Ministry of Information was  not  notified of the expulsion decision, but the information minister  learned of the matter at the last moment -- before the decision  was enforced -- from the foreign correspondents association. He  made immediate contacts that resulted in revoking the expulsion  decision.    Not only did Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif revoke  the  decision, he even met with the board of the Foreign  Correspondents Association last Saturday and voiced his  confidence in them. He assured them that his ministry and not  the Ministry of Interior, will be responsible for dealing with  foreign correspondents.

They ""console themselves"" with the thought that the refugees  and those people made homeless are in a worse position than  themselves. A person could overcome the economic difficulties  if it were not for the pillage and robbery, murders, terrorist  acts, and so forth. One gets the impression that  apparently nobody is any longer capable of establishing the  peace and order that people long for. However, the republic's  Security Minister Igor Giorgadze does not share this pessimistic  view.    [Gvelesiani] Batono [Georgian polite form of address]  minister, you were in western Georgia for almost one month.  What was the purpose of such a long trip?    [Giorgadze] In accordance with the instructions from the  head of state, I was entrusted with forming a brigade and going  to western Georgia in order to familiarize myself with current  processes there and implement effective measures aimed at  discharging the extremely serious crime situation.    From 20 February until 14 March, we were in Poti together  with the operational brigade, which was carrying out extremely  complex and labor-intensive work. Accompanying me were special  units from the Ministry of Security that were conducting  operations aimed at exposing and seeking reconciliation with  armed groups. These were not punitive operations. We held  talks with leaders of armed groups that fought on the side of  the ex-president and that, until now, have been hiding in the  forests. It is superfluous to speak about a general  reconciliation since all those who have been robbing and  intimidating the peaceful population have committed criminal  offenses and therefore have to be brought to account before the  law. The fact that there no longer exists the fear of the  revival of ""Zviadism"" in its armed form can be viewed as the  biggest achievement. We can confidently say today that the fear  of a new civil war in western Georgia has been eliminated. I  believe this is due to the work of employees of the Ministry of  Security and others.    For 24 days we held talks with three armed groups. It is  true that we were unable to achieve reconciliation with all of  the 160 persons united in these groups. However, the talks are  continuing and they require prudence, patience, and time.  Certain members of the law enforcement bodies have themselves  complicated our work; it has turned out that they have been  demanding fairly large sums for ""reconciliation"" from those  people who have been coming out of the forests with their  submachine guns. In addition to weapons that have been  surrendered voluntarily, we have managed to confiscate a large  quantity of firearms. We have retrieved stolen trucks and  equipment. However, this is the material side of the trip,  which I consider to be less important. The main thing is that  people have declared their trust in our department, and this has  the greatest social and political importance.    [Gvelesiani] The incident that occurred between the heads of  the two power ministries alarmed the entire republic [bomb blast  at the Ministry of Security building on 25 December 1993,  physical confrontations between security and defense ministry  personnel, including ministers over loss of Abkhazia, disruption  of signing of military agreement at Ashgabat CIS summit]. How  has it ended?    [Giorgadze] Reason prevailed in the conflict that arose  between me and the defense minister. The government commission  has not yet completed its work. I believe it will establish who  was wrong and who was right. For me, this question was of the  greatest importance in order to prevent a further aggravation of  the conflict. This was an unprecedented event in the history of  the state. If the situation is not cleared up, it could be  interpreted as an attempted coup. The damage suffered by the  Ministry of Security is very great. It amounts to 18 billion  coupons; two employees were seriously wounded and cars belonging  to the ministry were destroyed during the explosion. I think we  managed to avoid further complications arising from the conflict  when armored vehicles and armed persons were brought out onto  the street in order to seize the counterintelligence building.  Everything ended in little bloodshed.    [Gvelesiani] Batono Igor, the violations in the banking and  credit and financial system, the misappropriation of  humanitarian aid, and the removal of raw materials of strategic  importance from the state leads us to believe that a powerful  mafia is operating in Georgia.    [Giorgadze] For almost two years now, there has been talk  about violations in the credit and financial system; several  commissions have been formed and are working; suspects have been  arrested but, as can be seen, the major criminals have remained  free, as not a single serious violation in the banking sphere  has been cleared up.    On instructions from the head of state, our ministry became  interested in this matter. On the basis of investigative  materials, we arrested the vice-president of the National Bank.  Given the reaction that this fact has caused among a number of  senior officials, it can be supposed that we are dealing with  serious violations whose successful investigation will expose  all those who sacrificed the country's interests for their own  gain.    The Ministry of Security has been entrusted with forming an  independent economic service that will be able to control and  examine violations in the economic and credit systems. However,  at the moment, we do not have sufficient funds for this. It is  certain that existing mafia groups have found support both in  state bodies of administration and in executive power.  Therefore, the struggle against them and their exposure will  take a long time. This is a serious problem and the Ministry of  Security alone will not be able to cope with it.    [Gvelesiani] Does the fear exist that Georgia will become a  transit country for drugs?    [Giorgadze] Unfortunately, this process is already under way  and the international narcotics business, which trades in  illegal arms and narcotic substances, is interested in our  territory. The point is that, whereas before, the narcotics  route from Asia to Europe bypassed the USSR, it now runs as  follows: eastern Asia -- Pakistan -- Afghanistan -- Central  Asia -- Azerbaijan -- Georgia. Therefore, Georgia unhesitatingly  took part in the international conference held in Istanbul on  the initiative of the Black Sea countries and devoted to the  problems of the struggle against the narcotics business and  terrorism. Work in this direction is intensively under way. My  deputy and a special group are currently in Bucharest, where a  meeting of special services is continuing at which the latest  means and methods in the struggle against the drugs mafia are  being perfected. Incidentally, a sizable amount of drugs has  already been smuggled via Georgia to Europe. The absence of  borders and strict customs controls and appropriate legislation  are complicating our work very much.    [Gvelesiani] The view is being spread here and supported by  high-ranking officials in the power structures that Georgia is  unable to restore order by itself and, therefore, is calling on  an external force for help.    [Giorgadze] I do not share such a view. Georgia can  certainly establish order in its own land. This is borne out by  the recent intensification of the struggle against the criminal  world and the subsequent positive results that have been  achieved.    The Ministry of Security just like its predecessor -- the  Intelligence and Information Bureau, was not tasked with acting  upon information received. One got the impression that we could  only obtain information while some ""distant uncle"" would  establish order for us. Now, the situation is different. Those  special divisions that make up the power structures of the  Ministry of Security are well trained and well disciplined and  composed of young men trained to carry out special operations; I  believe it is possible to train similar groups in the Ministry  of Internal Affairs as well. In my view, the power structures  currently existing in the Ministry of Security should also exist  in the future in Georgian military formations in the form of  special subunits. The correct selection of professional cadres  will enable us to form and train such special subunits in all  the power ministries that will be able to restore order in the  country in the shortest period of time. We need more than just  the desire to do this. We need to create the appropriate  legislation, material and technical base, and means for this.  Then, we will no longer be reliant on external help but will be  able to act entirely on our own.    [Gvelesiani] When will the security service's archives be  made public?    [Giorgadze] After Gamsakhurdia became head of state,  ""interest"" in the security service's archives exceeded all  bounds. There were gross violations of the law. I believe we  should now form a parliamentary commission that will investigate  and determine how unique material, which was stored for tens of  years in the security service, was destroyed. Those documents,  which presented in an ""unembellished"" form the activities of  persons in the government, were removed and destroyed. Certain  unconscientious employees in the security service have used  archive materials to build their political careers and there  were also cases of archive materials being sold. There occurred  a series of serious violations that have to be exposed as a  matter of urgency.    The archives are now again in a sorrowful state; we do not  have the appropriate storage cases and repository that ensures  the protection of unique materials. As can be seen, we are  unable to appreciate what the Ministry of Security archives mean  for the country's security. There is the experience of other  countries where, after a certain period of time has elapsed,  secret documents become available to the public but only if they  do not compromise the interests of the state. In Great Britain,  when the time arrived to make public a certain number of  documents, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposed this and  postponed this measure for, I think, 30 years as the publication  of this material did not accord with the country's interests.    One can say without exaggeration that certain materials in  our archives could cause another civil war in Georgia.  Therefore, we should be very careful with archive materials. I  would like to ask Parliament: True, there are many very serious  problems to be resolved in the country, but a legislative base  should be elaborated in the shortest period of time that would  enable the Ministry of Security and the entire state security  system to function normally. The existence of laws would settle  many questions and also strictly define the problem of the  safekeeping of materials in the archives.    [Gvelesiani] Batono minister, the public is alarmed by the  terrorist acts that are being aimed at certain individuals or  formations. While pointing out the high professional level of  the crimes that have been committed, the leaders of political  parties are clearly pointing the finger at the Ministry of  Security. The inability to solve these crimes strengthens  suspicions....    [Giorgadze] It is naive to think about an improvement in the  criminal situation when there is a huge amount of weapons and  explosive materials in the hands of the population; against the  background of the existing chaos in the banking system, we are  now facing the consequences of the wave of violence perpetrated  by persons who have become unbelievably rich as a result of  illegal commercial operations and mafia clans. Groups that have  been deceived or swindled are settling scores with one another,  dividing spheres of influence, are often unable to agree with  one another.... Nothing new or special is happening in Georgia.  This is a characteristic feature of any capitalist system and  is being strengthened here with the formation of a free market  economy.    As for those leaders of political parties who often travel  abroad, they know very well that the problem of terrorism exists  on a world scale and, in a number of countries, it has been  raised to the rank of state policy. Therefore, such a naive  approach to a most important question is embarrassing, as is  heaping blame on the security service.    You often hear the security service being reproached on  account of its ""inaction"" -- not a single terrorist crime has  been solved. I am ready to deliver a report on the work carried  out to the relevant commission. Provided you do not claim that  I am trying to justify myself, I would like to give you a few  examples concerning terrorist acts carried out in Great Britain.  Between 20 December 1993 and 29 January of this year (in  London) and between 15 December 1993 and 4 February of this year  in Northern Ireland, more than 20 explosions took place, causing  damage to buildings, the subway, houses, and shopping centers.  There were victims among the law-abiding population. Not one  of these crimes has been solved! It is also significant that  this has been taking place in a democratic country that has a  400-year-old parliamentary tradition, the strongest  investigative and special services in the world, and a police  force equipped with the most modern equipment.    In our conditions, it is particularly difficult to solve  terrorist crimes since, apart from our not having the necessary  equipment, our work is being complicated by other factors. I  will give you some concrete facts. A terrorist act was  committed against the ""Mkhedrioni"" [""Horsemen"" -- a legally  sanctioned armed formation recently incorporated into the Rescue  Corps] leaders Zaza Vepkhvadze and Gia Svanadze. Our  investigators were not permitted onto the scene of the crime;  following an explosion in Rustavi, Temur Talakhadze, the leader  of the ""Mkhedrioni"" branch in Rustavi, was killed. The scene of  the crime was sealed off and we were not allowed there either.  We were granted access several hours after the event but could  not find any incriminating materials or other material evidence.  The same thing happened following the explosion at [Deputy  Defense Minister] Nikoloz Kekelidze's apartment. Ministry of  Security employees were only allowed in after the second  explosion (at that time the heads of the Ministry of Defense  were examining the scene of the crime). We were able to set  about our work some 12 hours after the terrorist act had been  committed. Naturally, we found that all evidence had again been  destroyed and the scene of the crime had been tidied up.    In spite of the aforementioned or other objective or  subjective reasons, the greater part of these crimes are in the  process of being solved. At the moment I cannot say any more  about this. However, we hope that the investigations will soon  be over and the criminals will be brought to justice.  Therefore, it is possible to make complaints provided they have  some substance. We will accept any kind of criticism but  neither the Ministry of Security nor any self-respecting  professional will accept something that is undeserved.    [Gvelesiani] Batono minister, to what extent is it possible  to forecast the next terrorist act?    [Giorgadze] It is possible to forecast the targets of  terrorist acts but I believe that making such forecasts is an  unenviable and ignoble activity. At the same time, it is highly  risky as the opposing side can use these forecasts to their  advantage.    It is possible that such acts will continue. We know of  high-ranking officials who accumulated vast wealth during the  [civil] war. It is expected that they will redistribute spheres  of influence, which does not exclude the use of violent methods.  I am convinced that these persons, who, for several days were  locked up, hungry and thirsty, in ""safes,"" will definitely try  to pay their opponents back for this. Yes, there have been such  cases. Those who reckon that the other side has cheated them of  thousands or millions of dollars, will try to retrieve these  huge sums by violent means. In clarifying their relations,  neither side will refrain from shedding blood.    [Gvelesiani] Are these terrorist acts perhaps politically  motivated?    [Giorgadze] This also cannot be excluded as there have been  cases of terrorist acts committed against various political  parties. There have been explosions at some of their  headquarters; buildings have been damaged; there have been no  victims although this has possibly been due to pure chance.  Incidentally, a political battle implies the use of terrorist  methods -- in an uncivilized society, of course.    I have often said and emphasize once more: In order to  establish order in the country and put a halt to the wave of  violence perpetrated by criminal bands, the power ministries  must have the very latest equipment and, in order to train  specialists, the state must spend sizable sums of money.  Otherwise, no one will put a stop to the anarchy and disorder.  We will not be able to restore the economy without the  involvement of foreign partners who, precisely on account of the  criminal situation, are refraining from making any investments.    Therefore, I ask the head of state, Parliament, the  government, and the republic's population to invest immediately  the necessary funds into strengthening the Ministry of Security.    Our salvation is in our own hands!     "

Jerusalem was  in the headlines this week. What are the rabbis' enlightening  views?    [Baqshi-Doron] I knew such a question would be asked. I  think one of the nicest and most heroic things we did this past  year was not to talk about the issue. As the saying goes, he  who is prudent will keep silent in such a time, for it is an  evil time. Keeping silent is not easy. However, we set  ourselves a rule in our capacity as chief rabbis who feel the  influence they have on the entire nation to keep silent on such  a controversial issue.    [Correspondent] This silence is being interpreted as  cowardice and gutlessness.    [Baqshi-Doron] God forbid. The moment we are called upon to  make an halakic ruling on the issue -- and this will happen --  we will consult our eminences and give our opinion. Today I do  not know whether the leaders know where they are headed.    [Correspondent] But the rabbis cannot sit idly by when the  nation is so split.    [Baqshi-Doron] Not only the nation, but also the rabbis, are  divided. Rabbis and religious Jews differ on political and  halakic issues. We know that our opinion does not carry any  weight at this point. Consequently, as long as this is not  necessary, we do not want to make a ruling favoring one side,  which would only exacerbate the conflict.    [Lau] The issue came up in a meeting of the Chief Rabbinate  Council after the publication of the Oslo agreement.    The Chief Rabbinate in its current constellation abides by  resolutions passed by its predecessors. The matter has been  discussed in one way or another over the 27 years since the  Six-Day War. Since we accept these resolutions based on the  halakic ruling about ""honoring the edicts of elders,"" we  presented them to current council members. These resolutions  are registered in the minutes of the council's sessions, which  answers your question about our position on the issue. The  Israeli people's right over Eretz Yisra'el is inalienable. So,  I speak as an educator, a father, a rabbi, and a teacher -- not  as a politician -- when I emphasize the verse: He has shown His  people the power of His works, in giving them the heritage of  the nations. This is the basis of the entire Bible, and there  is no question about it. On the basis of this principle that we  all abide by, a process is currently under way whose details we  are not familiar with. We said that as rabbis we must be sure  of one thing: that the right over Eretz Yisra'el is not  impaired. Even if politicians and the military must decide in  their peace talks that they must give self-rule in a certain  place within a certain period of time, this should not undermine  our right over Eretz Yisra'el.    We will not be dragged into any corner of the political  arena. We uphold the basic right concerning the integrity of  Eretz Yisra'el, the right of Jews to live in all parts of Eretz  Yisra'el. As long as this right is assured and is not impaired,  we will abide by the consensus.    [Correspondent] Could you be more specific about the  evacuation of Jews from Hebron?    [Lau] We are opposed to the evacuation of Jews from Hebron.  We must pray for them to be able to live there, but we are  opposed to their evacuation.    [Baqshi-Doron] I am in principle opposed to an evacuation,  but the duty to save Jewish lives legitimizes an evacuation.  [passage omitted]     "

Chief Buthelezi said: ""We are never going to have peace and  prosperity in South Africa by eliminating each other through  such terrible acts of violence."" He had noted with regret that  there had already been some conjectures by the Midlands  leadership of the African National Congress [ANC] about who was  responsible for the carnage.    Midlands ANC Deputy Chairman Chief Zibuse Mlaba said on  Saturday he suspected those who didn't want people to vote were  responsible for the massacre. The ANC said the victims were  preparing for an ANC voter education workshop on Saturday and  police said they were inside a hut when four gunmen shot at  them. Some of the victims were stabbed to death.    On the resignation of IFP's Deputy Secretary-General Simon  Gumede, Chief Buthelezi said Mr Gumede, a chief, wanted to spend  more time looking after the affairs of his people. There was no  bad feeling between himself and Mr Gumede, Chief Buthelezi added.     "

Tolstsikov, chairman of  the Central Council of the Russian Association for Friendship  and Cultural Cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea, sent a letter on May 26 to Russian President Boris  Yeltsin concerning Kim Yong-sam's trip to Moscow slated for  early June.

Judging from the recent foreign trips of the South Korean big  shot, he said, one can guess easily that one of the basic aims  to be sought by him in his forthcoming visit to Russia is to  discuss this issue.

0,FT932-1027 ,"FT932-1027 _AN-DFYB8ADKFT 930625   FT  25 JUN 93 / Arts: RSC lightweights come to London - Theatre      By ALASTAIR MACAULAY   The two 1992 stagings that the RSC has just brought to London - A Winter's Tale in the main Barbican, The Odyssey in the Pit - are both lively and both lightweight. One particular feature of the Winter's Tale production is that too few of the actors know how to make minor syllables, minor words, rapid and/or hushed utterance register to the sides and depths of the big theatre: a flaw that has made too many RSC transfers lightweight in the big Barbican Theatre. This Winter's Tale, which won several golden opinions in Stratford, is directed by Adrian Noble. It runs fluently, tells its story clearly, proves a good show. The groundless jealousy that makes Leontes so problematic a role becomes credible here; John Nettles's multi-faceted Leontes blows warm and cold, is trusting and suspicious. Yet when I remember Peter Hall's (by no means perfect) 1988 National Theatre Winter's Tale, I find that Noble's staging misses the play's scale. There is a high-flown edge of heroic melodrama to Leontes, making us stand apart from him even as he sucks us into his violent inner whirlpool; and so Tim Pigott-Smith showed. Nettles is sensitive, reasonable, but small-scale. He neither distances us nor draws us in. Paulina, by contrast, embodies good sense and moral outrage without ever soaring into such heights: and Eileen Atkins's raging force vibrates in the memory. Gemma Jones has both sense and sensibility, but her account of this winning role is a tad too elegant and refined. Samantha Bond's charming Hermione has more edge; and Andrew Jarvis's Antigonus is more directly communicative. Phyllida Hancock's Perdita is a fake-radiant country-bumpkin bore, and Richard McCabe's Autolycus is sour even when amusing. Anthony Ward's designs (with costumes veering between Victorian gowns and blue denim jeans) make a big gimmick out of balloons: entertaining, without illuminating the play. Derek Walcott's version of The Odyssey, as staged by Gregory Doran, is a vivid little dollop of multiculturalism and transhistoricism, recommended chiefly to politically-correct wet liberals. (Costumes range from Ancient Greek to traditional Caribbean. Accents, even among the residents of Ithaca, from Caribbean to south London. Parlance switches from 'My love is like a little black lamb asleep on a hill' to 'Me lost a husband too.') All of which, as applied here, shrinks Homer's world considerably. Walcott winds the old story up as if it were The Wizard of Oz, with Odysseus suddenly recognising the people of his 20-year absence in the faces of the folk back home. Walcott's revisionist account does nothing shocking, but it is soppy enough to make Odysseus win over mean old Thersites. This is not - is not meant to be - an epic. Just lots of poetry. Some of Walcott's lines are fine (Odysseus says of Ajax: 'He always strode as if earth were dung to his heels'), but there are over-many self-conscious purple patches in which one metaphor is piled too rapidly on another. And this Odyssey boils Homer's characters down into two-dimensional stereotypes. Ron Cook is a natural Odysseus (wily, fallible, determined), and perfectly judges this production's sub-heroic tone. Too many of the supporting roles are cheaply conceived, but Peter de Jersey plays Eurylochus, Achilles, and other roles with a kind of integrity that is arresting.

0,FT934-15497 ,"FT934-15497 _AN-DJLB5AA5FT 931012   FT  12 OCT 93 / China lets off a blast of pique      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   WHEN China detonated a nuclear device underground at its Lop Nor test site last week, it seemed more like a riposte to a world that had not been all that kind to it recently than a blast in the interests of national defence. In Beijing, where the mood is decidedly less buoyant than before China's crushing disappointment over its loss of the Olympics to Sydney, it is possible to detect a sourness towards the outside world: although Chinese officials are careful to avoid suggestions they have been bad losers. The harder edge to Chinese policy statements was apparent in an address by Premier Li Peng on the eve of the October 1 anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. 'We are firmly opposed to all acts of interference in China's internal affairs and acts of violating China's sovereignty and will absolutely not accept them,' Mr Li said. While they might not say so publicly, there is no doubt officials apportion a good deal of blame to human rights campaigners in the west for the Olympics loss. Beijing is finding that constructive engagement with the outside world is not a simple thing, and brings with it pressures that could be ignored, or at least shrugged off, in the past. Now, it is not so easy, if China wants to continue to reap the benefits of its increasing interdependence with the world economy. The nuclear test in many ways encapsulates the problem, with Chinese officials claiming Beijing was being subjected to 'double standards' by an international community whose mission was to keep China weak. The US, as officials point out, has conducted 25 times the number of China's nuclear tests. 'The Chinese Government has always exercised utmost restraint on nuclear testing and the number of nuclear tests it has conducted is extremely limited,' an official statement said. Chinese officials also charge that the west has a vested interested in applying a moratorium on nuclear testing, since this would preserve its advantage in the nuclear arms race. China exhibits similar irritation when an issue is made of its weapons sales, arguing its involvement in the arms business is dwarfed by that of the US as the world's biggest supplier of weapons. This was the theme of Beijing's reaction in August to Washington's announcement that it was imposing sanctions on the export of high-technology items in protest at Chinese missile sales to Pakistan. 'The US', a Chinese official charged, 'has poured large amounts of advanced weapons into the region sensitive to China, threatening its security, and made groundless accusations against it.' Western officials in Beijing have been monitoring carefully Chinese actions in the wake of the Olympics vote for signs of a hardening of attitudes. Indications that Beijing may again be stiffening its campaign against Governor Chris Patten's proposals for extending democracy in Hong Kong before China's 1997 takeover are being cited as evidence of Olympic fallout. Publication on the front pages of Chinese newspapers the day after the Olympics vote of an 11-year-old directive from Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, threatening to seize Hong Kong before 1997 if circumstances deteriorated there, is seen as one of the more conspicuous examples of Chinese pique. Domestically, a wave of executions of criminals and the sentencing to death of officials convicted of so-called economic crimes are also being portrayed as a sign of a more uncompromising leadership. But what is almost certainly true is that China's feelings have been bruised, and its responses to real or imagined slights by the international community are likely to be sharper in the months ahead.

AWB spokesman Fred Rundle said AWB leader  Eugene Terreblanche was not immediately available for comment.    Observers feared the incident could lead to acts of  retribution and increasing violence.    REUTER photographer Kevin Carter said he saw the AWB men  plead for their lives, crying ""please God help us"" before a  Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] soldier, ignoring his  comrades protests, took aim and shot them dead. He also pumped  bullets into the dead body of a third AWB member lying next to  them.    The three AWB men had been ambushed in the centre of  Mmabatho  in their green Mercedes car.    Mr Rundle said he had received reports that five other AWB  men had been injured in other incidents.    South African security sources said the incident showed the  AWB should have employed better military tactics when they  entered Mmabatho, moving around in larger groups and using  better communications. They also said the AWB men probably did  not expect the BDF to turn on them, if this is what happened.     "

In an exclusive statement to AL-MAJD in Beirut, Abu-Marzuq  said military action is a primary means of resistance against  the Israeli occupation. It has been proven that the Israeli  occupation knows no language other than that of force. Take,  for example, the outcome of the negotiations, which began with  the illusion of the ""state"" and ended up in the farce of  ""Gaza-Jericho"".    On the Cairo agreement signed recently between 'Arafat and  Rabin, Abu-Marzuq said: It is a farce. This agreement, as its  clauses show, is worse than the Camp David Accords. The points  of this agreement explain the vague Oslo accord in favor of the  Zionist enemy and at the expense of Palestinian, Arab, and  Islamic interests.    Asked by AL-MAJD about the movement's official position on  the agreement and the possibility of dealing with it as a fait  accompli, Abu-Marzuq wondered sarcastically: Can any sane  person accept this agreement or deal with it? Especially since  many of those who support a settlement are now weaseling out of  the agreement and refusing to deal with it.    Abu-Marzuq then said in a very serious tone: This ""farcical""  agreement does not commit Hamas and its heroes to anything at  all. We are going ahead with our jihad scheme without paying  heed to what 'Arafat and his tools conclude with the Zionists.    Answering a question about the relationship between Hamas  and  the alliance of the 10 factions, Abu-Marzuq said: We have a  good relationship despite recent reports casting doubt on this  relationship, which will remain pivotal for us.    Abu-Marzuq further stressed that Hamas seeks to develop this  relationship so the alliance can undertake its important jihad  role to defeat the Oslo and Cairo accords, as an indispensable  step before resuming the plan of liberation.    Abu-Marzuq, who had just heard about the unjust Zionist  bombing of the [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]  General Command positions in al-Na'imah, expressed his sympathy  and solidarity with the heroes of the General Command, saying:  We complement each other in the same trench and course.    On Jordan-Hamas ties after the recent problems resulting  from  Israeli threats, Abu-Marzuq said: Our brothers in Jordan know  well that the threats of Rabin and Peres came to distract  attention from Rabin's internal crisis first and from what was  being cooked up between 'Arafat and Peres without the knowledge  of Jordan, Syria, and the Arabs.    Abu-Marzuq asserted that Hamas is keen to preserve Jordan's  security and stability. Jordan is the land of mobilization and  steadfastness and the first line of confrontation against the  enemy occupying the land of Palestine. Abu-Marzuq said he looks  forward to good brotherly and lasting relations with Jordan.    On the fate of the 10 factions that oppose the settlement if  a Syrian-Israeli agreement is reached, Abu-Marzuq said he rules  out the possibility of such agreement in the short run,  considering the solid Syrian position. He stressed, however,  that the major organizational body of Hamas is inside the  occupied territories. Therefore, it remains free from influence  by any Palestinian or Arab agreements.    Commenting on the entry of the Palestinian police force into  Gaza and Jericho, Abu-Marzuq said: These forces are from the  sons of the Palestinian people and some of them fought heroic  battles for liberation. Therefore, we will welcome their  presence among the people there as long as they are protecting  the people's security. This position will change if these forces  change their attitude and turn into political forces to suppress  strugglers and opponents from various national and Islamic  political currents and persuasions.

Five of the Advantage Funds_Diversified Equity Fund, Growth Equity Fund, Conservative Balanced Fund, Moderate Balanced Fund, and Growth Balanced Fund (the ``Blended Funds'')_will continue their predecessor CIFs' practice of allocating specified percentages of their assets among several different investment styles. The Diversified Equity Fund and the Growth Equity Fund (the ``Blended Equity Funds'') seek to achieve long term capital appreciation by investing in equity securities. Consistent with their investment objectives, the Blended Equity Funds allocate a fixed percentage of their assets to several investment styles. Each Blended Equity Fund allocates a significant portion of its assets to investments in large, high quality domestic companies that, in the view of its adviser, have superior growth potential as well as, in the case of the Diversified Equity fund, equities that may provide above average dividend income. In addition, each Blended Equity Fund allocates a portion of its assets to investment in equity securities of small companies and a portion to investment in non-U.S. issuers. The Diversified Equity Fund also invests in a group of securities representing 96% or more of the capitalization-weighted market value of the stocks in the SP 500 Index. The Conservative Balanced Fund, the Moderate Balanced Fund, and the Growth Balanced Fund (collectively, ``Blended Balanced Funds'') invest in a balanced portfolio of fixed income and equity securities. Like the Blended Equity Funds, the Blended Balanced Funds allocate portions of their assets among different investment styles.    6. To an extent consistent with its investment objectives, each Blended Fund will invest directly in equity securities and, in the case of the Blended Balanced Funds, fixed income securities. Applicants believe that investors in the Blended Funds can obtain substantial benefits, however, if the Blended Funds pool the assets they allocate for investment in the securities of small companies, non-U.S. issuers, and companies listed in the SP 500 Index. Accordingly, applicants propose that the Blended Funds invest those portions of their portfolios in the Small Company, International, and Index Portfolios of Core Trust. Although at present only the Blended Funds intend to rely on the order, applicants also propose that any other series of Norwest Funds for which the Bank or any company controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Bank acts as adviser, or any open-end investment company for which the Bank or any company controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Bank acts as adviser in the future (collectively the ``Future Funds''), be permitted to invest in the Small Company, International, and Index Portfolios of Core Trust in the same manner as the Blended Funds.    7. Each existing CIF will convert into a corresponding series of the Advantage Funds by transferring the securities and cash in its portfolio to the corresponding Advantage Fund in exchange for shares of the Advantage Fund. Each CIF will then distribute shares of the Advantage Funds to each employee benefit plan     pro rata     according to its interest in the terminating CIF. When the Portfolios commence operations, each Blended Fund will contribute the small company, international, and SP 500 Index securities in its portfolio to the corresponding Portfolio in exchange for shares of that Portfolio.    8. All portfolio securities contributed in-kind will be appropriate investments for the Portfolios. Such in-kind transactions will comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of rule 17a7, except that the consideration for the securities contributed to Core Trust will be Core Trust shares rather than cash. After the initial contribution of securities, the Portfolios will buy and sell portfolio securities at the discretion of their respective portfolio managers.         "

'These products are safe enough,' said Mr Mike Shaffer, a public affairs officer at the FDA. 'But there is no evidence that they work. We're not saying they don't work, just that we don't know if they do.' The products, supported by millions of dollars of advertising, include Cigarrest, Bantron, Tabmint and Nikoban. Tabmint, a chewing gum containing silver acetate and which is supposed to make smoke taste unpleasant, is available in Britain. The withdrawn products do not include Nicorette gum and nicotine patches which, although available without a prescription in the UK, are not available over the counter (OTC) in the US. The US move led to calls yesterday in the UK for all OTC smoking cessation products to be withdrawn, including patches and nicotine gums. Ms Sandi Wilson, director of Quit, a charity dedicated to helping smokers give up, said there was no evidence any products worked when bought at a chemist without a prescription.

By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The issue is the Roman Catholic Church's views on homosexuality and AIDS.    On one side is the Church hierarchy. Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony has  banned priests from saying Mass for an organization of gay and lesbian  Catholics, condemned a San Fernando High School health clinic program for gay  teen-agers and declared that chastity, rather than the use of condoms, is the  only ""morally correct and medically secure way"" to prevent the spread of AIDS.    On the other side are politically active gay and Lesbian Catholics who  demonstrate against church officialdom, maintaining that they should be  included in church activities and that ""safe sex"" is medically and morally  sound. This month the issue heated up when an underground group of dissenters  defaced four Los Angeles County churches and distributed posters declaring  Mahony to be a murderer.    Stuck in the middle are the practicing gay and lesbian Catholics who are not  actively protesting and who do not wish to give up their association with the  church.    ""At times you feel sort of like an undercover agent,"" said Rick, who lives in  the Thousand Oaks area and did not, like most of the gay Catholics interviewed  for this article, want his last name to be printed. He attends Mass at his  local church every Sunday.    Rick used to belong to Dignity, a national organization with about 5,000  members that sponsors Masses for gay men and lesbians. Last year, Mahony  followed the lead of church officials in other parts of the country by banning  Dignity from holding services in church facilities. Then, in June, he declared  that priests could not administer Mass to Dignity groups in any venue. Rick's  local chapter of Dignity disbanded.    ""I left the church for a while in anger but I found that my life was just  generally miserable,"" Rick said. ""I felt the lack of religion in my life.""    Rick tried associating with Protestant groups that welcomed homosexuals, but he  did not find them fulfilling. ""I don't want to put down those ministers in any  way,"" he said, ""but it just was not a Catholic organization. That's what I,  personally, needed.""    The Los Angeles chapter of Dignity still exists and holds meetings at several  locations, including St. Matthew's Lutheran Church in North Hollywood. Indeed,  the Los Angeles chapter celebrates Mass every Sunday, often with a priest  willing to defy Mahony's directive.    ""We know priests who are still willing to come and do Mass for us,"" said Jack  Stafford, president of the Los Angeles chapter of Dignity, which he said has a  membership of about 200. ""And if we can't get one for a particular Sunday, a  para-liturgy is done. It's a Mass without a priest, like what is done in areas  where there are priestless congregations.""    But their defiance goes only so far. Stafford said he does not know anyone in  the underground group, which calls itself Greater Religious Responsibility,  that took credit for spattered red paint on four area churches, including St.  Charles Church of North Hollywood, in the early hours of Dec. 3, the first  Sunday of Advent.    ""I had never even heard of that group before all this happened,"" Stafford said.  ""I understand why it has come to this. When people feel adamant about an issue  and do not feel they are being effective by expressing themselves in words,  they sometimes turn to the kind of acts that occurred.""    While he understands the motivation behind GRR's actions, he vehemently  disagrees with them. ""What they did was not effective at all,"" he said. ""It  will not get the church to listen.

It makes it especially  difficult for young people just coming out.""    But Sandy, 47, who lives in North Hollywood, has also chosen to stay in the  church. ""We have taught ourselves that we are the church,"" she said. ""It's not  some bureaucratic group of men who make pronouncements. It's people like us. We  consider ourselves cultural Catholics, and it would be hard for us to leave, no  matter how conservative the edicts are.""    Lesbian Catholics Together meets once a month in members' homes. Sandy said the  group, which has about 25 active members, can usually find a sympathetic priest  to say Mass.    ""It is almost like in the early church when they met in people's homes in  secret,"" she said with a laugh. ""But we find that it is important to get  together. We are a support to each other emotionally and we share our  spirituality.""    It's not spirituality but sexuality that disturbs the church when it comes to  homosexuals. In his statement banning priests from celebrating Masses sponsored  by Dignity, Mahony reiterated the official church position that ""while . . .  homosexual orientation in itself is not to be regarded as a sinful condition .  . . genital activity by unmarried persons, or by married persons without being  open to procreation, is morally wrong.""    ""I don't follow the church's edicts in that respect any more than some of the  priests do not,"" Rick said, angrily. ""I have had a monogamous, loving  relationship with a man for eight years and we care about each other in a very  special way.""    Rick met the man he lives with at a Dignity mass in Ventura County, before that  group dissolved.    ""We go to church together every Sunday now, just like any other couple.""    Except that in the church they do not acknowledge to other worshipers that they  are a couple. ""I guess that there are some places where you cannot be the  person you want to be,"" Rick said. ""I needed the church and I needed to get on  with my life, so this is what I do. It's unfortunate. You want the church to be  a place of warmth and understanding for everyone.""    He does not ""confess"" to homosexual acts to his priest.    ""I tried that once, a long time ago,"" he said. ""It was with an older priest. I  hardly started talking about it and he said, 'You don't want to be doing that.'  Then he absolved me from my sins and I was out of there before I hardly knew  what happened. It was not a good experience.""    Sandy and her lover also go to church together on occasion. ""We used to live in  Tarzana, and in that parish we were pretty much known as a lesbian couple,"" she  said. ""But where we are now, it hasn't really come up.""    Eventually, if the arguments about homosexuality and the church continue to  heat up, she said, she might feel compelled to go more public with her views.    ""I think if someone said something I really disagreed with, something I found I  could not just let go, I would speak out. I would have to do something.""    In the meantime, Stafford advises patience.    ""We can do a lot more from inside the church than those who deface it,"" he  said. ""Our time of acceptance will come.

To stay on the world's summit requires much more than brute  force and technical, military, and media superiority. This  requires a humanitarian message that convinces the world's  peoples. This is something Washington does not have, as U.S.  circles admit.    Some confused people do not see the U.S. slide, but continue  to see the old upward trend. These people do not see the  opportunities in the region and the international arena.    Even more serious is the fact that these people have seen  the  U.S. progress, but they did not note -- due to their horror and  blindness -- that this climb to the summit of global positions  was due to notable collapses. This means the United States  moved forward because there was no resistance, or, let us say,  it moved ahead as a result of multiple absences. The collapse  of the Soviet Union was basically due to self-motivated reasons,  and the same was the case with countries of former Socialist  bloc. The collapse of Somalia was due to famine and fighting.  The official Arab journey to Madrid was the result of the  collapse of rulers and officials. Therefore, the U.S. rise  cannot be viewed as a victory over heroic and persistent  resistance.    The only exception during the short years of the U.S. rise  was Iraq. Iraq has been and still is the one voicing the  pan-Arab and humanitarian 'no', with faith in God, people, and  objectives. That was the reason for the 30-state aggression and  all its destruction and siege. Despite everything it did, the  United States stood helpless and defeated under the walls of the  Iraqi fortress while in the zenith of its rise.    Now, the image is different. The U.S. downfall is becoming  clearer. Iraq remained and its leadership and determination  continued without change. The Russian awakening is clear.  Somalia is witnessing the triumph of its resistance. The  people of Palestine were not deceived by the false peace and its  agreements and negotiators. Palestinians continue to throw  stones and to fire bullets, rejecting the results of the  collapse of officials and rulers.    None of us denies Washington owns huge quantities of  sophisticated weapons and possesses advanced media. We all  suffered from the air, missile, and media shelling, but this did  not undermine the Iraqis and the Arabs, and did not deceive the  Somalis and Russians for long. Army occupation does not mean  occupation of the will. Monopolizing the media does not  necessarily mean occupying the mind.    At the peak of the hostile media campaign that took part in  the destructive aggression and siege, the faith of the Arab  nation in Iraq -- leader and people -- increased, even though  Iraqi media did not reach all Arab lands.    At the peak of the military and media invasion of Somalia,  the Somali people rejected the invasion and its pretexts, even  though the Somali people did not have enough bread and lack even  modest mass media.    When all the hostile media that targeted Iraq mobilized  against the Palestinian people, and inundated them with the  promises of peace, prosperity, and stability, the Palestinian  people -- who lack their own media that believe in national and  pan-Arab constant -- were not deceived. They continued to fight  the enemy as an alternative to negotiating with the enemy.    The changes demonstrated much of what Iraq had said and  predicted during the peak of the collapses that shocked the  world, but did not move Iraq.    The United States is in the downfall stage, and Iraq --  leader and people -- and Palestine -- people and resistance --  are in the rising stage amid a clear awakening that is  demonstrated in the division in the Security Council.

The  modernization process is a fact and it will be developed and  implemented, the minister continued.    Meanwhile, (Jose Maria Cabascango), leader of the National  Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, said the  Indian movement is not opposed to the modernization of the  country, but it is opposed to the indiscriminate privatization  of state-owned companies. That is why, he remarked, we will  continue to support the struggle throughout the country with  mobilizations and assemblies.    Minister Marcelo Santos asserted that the first day of the  48-hour strike occurred without major incidents, although there  were some sporadic incidents in various areas in the country.  Santos said the strike is progressing normally and the rights  of workers and other sectors have been respected, particularly  those of Indians who have blocked traffic between provinces.  The minister stated the government is not expecting acts of  violence, but the police and Armed Forces are ready to guarantee  the peace and security of Ecuadorans.     "

By NANCY MILLS      When the cast of producer David Puttnam's WWII movie ""Memphis Belle"" signed on,  they knew they would be spending weeks in tight quarters in a mock-up of a B-17  bomber. What they didn't know was that before filming began, they would go  through basic training -- swimming through rat-infested waters and running  through the woods trying to avoid stun grenades.    The ""Memphis"" cast endured its own mini-war -- an eight-day ordeal on Dartmoor,  an isolated area of southwestern England where a former member of Britain's  Special Air Services whipped them into shape mentally and physically.    ""It was important to get that spirit of camaraderie,"" said director Michael  Caton-Jones. ""We didn't want them to have to pretend. However, the only way to  forge them quickly was to put them through hell.""    For some, it was their worst nightmare; others found it invigorating and  challenging.

By NANCY MILLS      When the cast of producer David Puttnam's WWII movie ""Memphis Belle"" signed on,  they knew they would be spending weeks in tight quarters in a mock-up of a B-17  bomber. What they didn't know was that before filming began, they would go  through basic training -- swimming through rat-infested waters and running  through the woods trying to avoid stun grenades.    The ""Memphis"" cast endured its own mini-war -- an eight-day ordeal on Dartmoor,  an isolated area of southwestern England where a former member of Britain's  Special Air Services whipped them into shape mentally and physically.    ""It was important to get that spirit of camaraderie,"" said director Michael  Caton-Jones. ""We didn't want them to have to pretend. However, the only way to  forge them quickly was to put them through hell.""    For some, it was their worst nightmare; others found it invigorating and  challenging.    ""For me, boot camp was a tremendous experience,"" said 19-year-old Sean Astin,  who plays the bellygunner, encased in a glass and steel bubble below the B-17.

[passage  omitted] Meanwhile, Supreme Court President Juan Jose Rodil  Peralta issued a strong statement condemning the killing, which  adversely affects the state of law in Guatemala. Rodil Peralta  added this killing demonstrates those responsible for numerous  acts of violence in the past are still on the loose.    Gonzalez Dubon's wife, the main witness to the killing, said  she does not believe the motive of the killing was a car theft,  as certain versions have reported. She added there was no  attempt to steal the car, and the assailants unloaded their  weapons into the car, damaging it badly.    According to another version, unidentified gunmen were  following Gonzalez, who tried to take shelter in his home, where  they reached him. Apparently, police protection at the victim's  home had been withdrawn due to the recent change of the interior  minister. Gonzalez' body was taken to a funeral parlor, where  several people have come to express their condolences, including  lawyers, former magistrates, and other Guatemalan political  personalities. Gonzalez's funeral was scheduled for tomorrow,  after being honored at the Constitutionality Court.     "

In this spirit,  government spokesman Vogel interpreted statements by Interior  Minister Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) on Friday [25  March], who had called an agreement with Turkey desirable, in  which the government in Ankara should commit itself to adhering  to international human rights standards in potential trials of  the people affected. The day before, Kanther explained that he  had ""contacted Foreign Minister Kinkel so that we could come to  something like a deportation agreement with Turkey, in which  Turkey promises under international law that Kurds who committed  acts of violence and who are deported from Germany are not  sentenced to death in Turkey because of the prior deed."" On  Friday morning (local time) Kurds occupied the German Consulate  General in Melbourne, Australia, for 30 minutes; then they  withdrew. No damage was caused, it was said in Bonn.    Spokesmen of the Federal Government insisted on Friday that,  in any case, it will remain so that Kurdish demonstrators must  not be deported if they are threatened with a death sentence or  with torture in Turkey. Kanther's statements caused problems of  interpretation in the Federal Government since, by making them,  the minister recognized that Turkey is violating human rights.  Interior Ministry spokesman Dauke said that the goal of the  considerations could be a ""binding promise"" by Turkey to abolish  obstacles to deportation that exist in Germany. With a view to  the international human rights conventions, which have also been  signed by Turkey, government spokesman Vogel said that the  Federal Government ""assumes"" that Turkey is adhering to the  agreements. Potential additional agreements were given  primarily domestic importance by Vogel; these could increase the  acceptance of decisions for deportation.    In the Federal Government it is still unclear what a  deportation agreement with Turkey could look like. Foreign  Minister Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) ordered  officials of his Ministry to examine the matter. Following the  violent demonstrations, at the beginning of the week the FRG  Interior Ministry, the FRG Justice Ministry, as well as the  Foreign Ministry were ordered by the Cabinet to examine the  existing legal situation; they are also supposed to examine  whether new laws are necessary. The Federal Cabinet will discuss  a draft on this matter at the end of April. The government  spokesman said that, even though the principle of reasonableness  is to be observed in decisions concerning deportations, it is  primarily the government's task to ensure security and order.  However, valid laws and practice obviously do not deter from  committing acts of violence.    With a view to human rights violations in Turkey, Vogel said  that the Federal Government has repeatedly told the Turkish  Government ""tactfully but also very clearly"" that it must adhere  to the norms of the Council of Europe, which it has signed.  However, no pressure should be exerted on Turkey. The ""Workers  Party of Kurdistan"" (PKK) is a terrorist organization.  Terrorism must be and may be fought also in this case.  Referring to the situation reports by the Foreign Ministry, its  spokesman said that the Federal Government is ""concerned"" about  the observance of human rights in Turkey. Kinkel has repeatedly  made this clear to his Turkish interlocutors.    The government's commissioner for foreigners,  Schmalz-Jacobsen (Free Democratic Party of Germany), said in a  newspaper interview that one must not react with the slogan ""All  Kurds out!"" to the demonstrations. The aliens' law regulates  the conditions for deportation. ""Wherever it is necessary and  possible deportations must be carried out."" It is not necessary  to amend the laws.    Social Democratic Party of Germany Deputy Bernrath also  warned against amending the aliens' law. Greens European Deputy  Roth said that her party supports ""the peaceful demonstrations  of Kurds in the FRG."" As long as Turkey violates the principles  of a rule-of-law state and of human rights, Kurds must not be  deported from Germany.    On the previous day, the Turkish ambassador to Bonn had  called reports about reprisals against Kurdish separatists  propaganda. In contrast, Seelig, a Berlin Party of Democratic  Socialism deputy who is currently in Diyabakir, said that last  week ""eight villages were destroyed just in the area of Lice,  many people were kidnapped, and at least two young men were  killed."" His group, which wants to examine the conditions in  the region, has repeatedly been threatened and hindered by the  Turkish military.     "

Is he still silent on the  issue of terrorism? Has he explained to you why is he  refraining from publicly denouncing these terrorist acts?    [Al-Tibi] Look, I was with the chairman in Cairo before we  received the news about the murder in 'Afula. At the time  'Arafat held a meeting with the Spanish foreign minister; there  were a lot of Spanish, Egyptian, and other foreign journalists  who wanted to speak to him about other issues, but he left the  place. He did not want to speak to them. Later he refused to  meet other journalists, some of them Israelis....    [Talmor, interrupting] Washington, however, is exerting  great pressure on him.    [Al-Tibi continues] After we received the report about the  murderous attack on innocent civilians in 'Afula we held a  closed meeting in which we formulated an unequivocal  statement....    [Talmor, interrupting] Why has 'Arafat himself not denounced  this attack, as Rabin publicly and firmly did after the Hebron  massacre.    [Al-Tibi] The chairman participated with us in formulating a  statement, in which we expressed regret....    [Talmor, interrupting] I want to ask again, why is 'Arafat  afraid to publicly denounce these terrorist acts?    [Al-Tibi continues] ...and condolences for the bereaved  families. This was done on behalf of the chairman, who said in  the past that innocent people must not be harmed. This  statement would not have been accepted without the chairman's  involvement and approval. His position regarding such violence  and terrorism is known; only a month ago he sharply denounced  the murder of Mrs. Shoshan. I believe that the PLO statement  was unequivocal. What the chairman told us on this issue is  extremely clear and firm.    [Talmor] Why, then, does Washington still insist that  'Arafat publicly denounce these acts?    [Al-Tibi] The 'Afula attack is doubtlessly a most terrible  murder of innocent people. A murder is a murder is a murder. I  believe this attack must be denounced.    [Talmor] I, however, still insist 'Arafat should publicly  denounce the attack. Some people claim, for example, that he is  afraid to publicly denounce the attack because of PLO  rapprochement efforts with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement].  Some people even claim the PLO is coordinating with Hamas, and  a public denunciation of Hamas terror acts could harm these  efforts.    [Al-Tibi] These claims are utter nonsense. The PLO's and  'Arafat's stand on violence and terrorism is known and is  expressed whenever there are such grave incidents. This  position was also expressed after the murder of Mrs. Shoshan.  There is absolutely no coordination between the PLO and Hamas  in this area, and whoever says so does not know what he is  talking about. This issue does not deserve any further comment.    [Talmor] Despite the recent acts of terrorism and the fact  that it was the PLO that halted the negotiations following the  Hebron massacre, the Israeli Government yesterday said it wants  to facilitate the negotiations, while accusing you of delaying  the talks. What is your reaction to this?    [Al-Tibi] It was the Israeli side that suspended the talks  several days ago, not the Palestinians. They did this due to  Holocaust Memorial Day. But instead of halting the talks for  one day only they did it for three days. The claim that the  Palestinians halted the talks is baseless. It is in our  interest to end the talks as soon as possible in order to  immediately receive the authority and power in Gaza and Jericho.  At this point there are still controversial issues, due to  obstacles placed by the Israeli delegation on the way to  achieving an agreement between the two sides -- mainly in  relation to the deployment of the Palestinian police force; the  timetable for such a deployment; legal responsibility, and other  issues I do not want to broach.    [Talmor] Do you believe you will be able to control the area  when you receive the authority?    [Al-Tibi] At this point the PLO is still not in control of  the occupied territories. It is far away from them. The IDF is  in charge there at the present time. I believe that in future  the Palestinians will maintain full control of all areas under  their authority.     "

In Churkin's opinion, it is precisely due to the use  of this term that various misunderstandings have resulted and a  negative reaction has come from some former USSR union republic  capitals. In Churkin's opinion, the Baltic countries can in no  way be included in the near abroad because those countries left  the USSR even before it disintegrated and are not likely to seek  CIS membership.    At the same time, Churkin emphasized that the term near  abroad should not be interpreted as a threat against the  sovereignty of any state because Russia, the CIS, and the Baltic  countries were united into a country for years; consequently,  they also have many problems in common, including the issue of  the Russian-speaking population, said Churkin.    A meeting of representatives of Russian communities living  in  the near abroad took place in Moscow, with nearly 70 people  attending. All those present found that there are human rights  violations taking place in Latvia and Estonia, a fact that lifts  international legal acts above the national ones. As a  consequence, the Russian-speaking population has become  stateless in those countries. [passage omitted]     "

Angina, the chest pains caused by an inadequate supply of blood to the heart, is usually successfully treated by angioplasty, a procedure which widens narrowed arteries. But a third of patients suffer complications in the form of renewed narrowing of the arteries or, more rarely, from the formation of blood clots. Research carried out by King's College School of Medicine in London, which is due to be published in tomorrow's Lancet, found that a blood-clotting mechanism is activated during angioplasty. Arterial narrowing appears to stem from the excessive activity of growth factors contained in white blood cells called platelets. The researchers found that the platelet activity was inhibited in a small group of patients who received an infusion of a nitrate medicine called S-nitroso-glutathione GSNO before the angioplasty. It is thought to cause nitric oxide to be released by the platelets, which acts as a brake on their activity. Further work will now be undertaken.

0,FT932-3292 ,"FT932-3292 _AN-DFOCRADOFT 930615   FT  15 JUN 93 / Arts: Benvenuto Cellini - Opera      By DAVID MURRAY   Never more than a semi-success during Berlioz's lifetime, on Sunday in the Queen Elizabeth Hall his 1838 opera semi-seria proved to be a marvellous tonic - as Chelsea Opera Group concert-performances regularly are. The Group's knack for choosing exactly the operas that will reward current revival, and bestowing historical care and dramatic flair upon them in equal measure, makes their concerts indispensable fixtures in the London season. Their Cellini was rewarding even beyond their excellent norm. It says a lot for a performance three-and-a-quarter-hours long in concert dress without any pretence at staging, that it not only held the delighted attention of a full house but actually went from strength to strength. The COG has given the opera before, but only in the compromised 'final' version that Berlioz accepted for Liszt's Weimar performances in the 1850s. This time they borrowed the fine Royal Opera recension, which restores most of the original Paris score but sensibly trims the spoken dialogue and the later recitatives. From the Overture forward the conductor Adrian Brown's just tempi and energetic confidence were relishable, whilst his four-square rhythms and his disregard for the characteristic bated-breath pianissimi were a touch disappointing. Something of Berlioz's volatile magic was lost. Yet in the end, energy won through: unhampered by the weight of a stage production, the score cantered along at a lively, natural pace, with satisfying variety and not a single longueur. The COG chorus was good as ever, if run slightly ragged in the quickest music. The nine soloists, however, made a team of real distinction - boasting a level of French diction unheard-of hereabouts even ten years ago. In lesser roles, Michael Hart-Davis whined nasally but musically as the fretful Innkeeper, and Lynton Atkinson and Martin Higgins brought alert character and cutting edge to Cellini's chief assistants. For his patron Pope Clement VII Brian Bannatyne-Scott's rich, ruminative bass served admirably. Dour and funny, Jeremy White was no less stylish as the Papal treasurer Balducci, Cellini's unwilling father-in-law-to-be. As the son-in-law he would have preferred, Geoffrey Dolton's clever, idiomatic Fieramosca rose to heroic defiance in his Act 2 aria. As Cellini's apprentice Ascanio the young mezzo Margaret McDonald cut an irresistible figure in breeches, displayed a remarkable vocal range and made a huge, unabashed success of her Act 2 party-piece - Offenbach before his time. Not long ago, Teresa Cahill sang a lovely Daphne for the COG in Strauss's opera. As Balducci's daughter Teresa here she made an unlikely 17-year-old, with a mature soprano's sumptuously spreading tone where her inamorato sported a youthful, tightly focused tenor; but her ripe musical thrust carried all before it, full of generous, subtle feeling in a role that makes relentless vocal demands. A couple of dodgy top-notes made no difference at all. Meanwhile her Cellini, Justin Lavender, fulfilled his promise of recent years with springing elan. He has made a speciality of those 19th-century French roles which prescribe a cruelly high tessitura for modern tenors, from whom a lusty, full-throated attack is now expected where their period predecessors probably got away with mere head-voice. In earlier Lavender performances the strain has occasionally showed, even while he shaped a vigorously elegant line. This time, as the challenges rose he not only met them with ringing assurance, but left himself room still for wry asides in roguish character. Berlioz would surely have been delighted.

As evidence and precise reports convey, the Republic of  Uzbekistan Government continues its interference, in various  forms, against the Muslim people of Afghanistan and national  sovereignty of the ISA [Islamic State of Afghanistan]. For  instance, this interference has clearly been felt since the  beginning of the current fighting in Afghanistan. Relations and  good-neighborliness taken into account, the ISA brought this  issue to the attention of the related authorities of the  Republic of Uzbekistan in a friendly manner through diplomatic  channels, and was expecting such interference to be prevented.    But, unfortunately, against the expectation of the ISA and  the Muslim nation of Afghanistan, not only was this interference  not stopped, but it was intensified. The ISA strongly protests  against such interfering acts by Uzbekistan in the internal  affairs of Afghanistan, which demonstrate the unfriendly policy  of that country, and is against the UN Charter and all  internationally accepted current norms and principles, and  demands from the authorities of that country to seriously  refrain from the repetition and continuation of such  interference which will have grave consequences for and negative  impact on the relations of the two neighborly countries.  Otherwise, the ISA cannot remain indifferent toward such  interference.     "
0,FT932-5027 ,"FT932-5027 _AN-DFFAXAEFFT 930605   FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Credible rendering of cruelty - Alastair Macaulay examines the updated Shylock      By ALASTAIR MACAULAY   'THE VILLAINY you teach me I will execute.' David Calder, the RSC's outstanding Shylock in David Thacker's new modern-dress Merchant of Venice, makes this a key line. Yes, he is a Jew, but he only fully enacts 'Jewishness' - donning a skullcap, using florid gestures, enouncing words in the mask of the face, forsaking his elegant city suit for a dour traditional gaberdine - when the Christians have insulted him, beguiled him and, finally, stolen his daughter Jessica. Yes, he becomes cruel, but only because he has been made so by persistent and unthinking Christian cruelty. He has been taught by masters. Dignified, erect, urbane, his voice a heroic high baritone, Calder dominates the play. For him, Thacker has even reinstated the post-Shakespearean scene in which Shylock returns home to find Jessica gone: as Irving used to, and as Verdi's Rigoletto does. Even in the courtroom scene, a sob escapes this Shylock as he recalls his daughter - but then he recollects himself and, in full view, his face becomes marble once more. There are snags in so reasonable and updated a reading of Shylock - the only obvious reason that Jessica might have for leaving such a father is that she prefers partying to loud rock music to staying at home with his piano-quartet CDs - but it is astonishing how potently most of the play supports this noble reading. Thacker's Venice, as designed by Shelagh Keegan, is a colourless high-tech cityscape. Salerio, Solanio  Co. are crass city slickers; Bassanio calls Graziano on his mobile 'phone; Antonio is a white-haired older gent; Launcelot Gobbo (with V-neck sweater and coffee mug) is Shylock's office boy. These people's anti-Semitism is not gross. It is simply casual, unthinking, shallow prejudice, and all the more credible. Most features of the updating work with remarkable success, and Christopher Luscombe's mimsy, prattling Launcelot is a comic triumph. The Belmont scenes are more artificial. Penny Downie's Portia receives her suitors in a 'period' full-length gown (and in mourning), and Nerissa's dress is mock-18th century. Only later do these two fully enter the modern world. Thacker catches the lovers' comedy of the final act neatly, and Keegan's designs lend it colour. They do not, however, stop it from being the usual charming anti-climax. Only Peter Hall's 1989 staging in my experience has caught this scene's darker emotional pains, its moving belief in the power of music, and its Renaissance return to rich musical harmony. When Thacker's Lorenzo (Mark Lewis Jones) talks of 'The man that hath no music in himself,' he unfortunately indicts Jessica, himself, most of their chums and Gary Yershon's electronic muzak. Downie, who five years ago fought a battle royal against Calder as Queen Margaret to his York in The Plantagenets, is here outclassed. She has Portia's breeding, her romance, and (interesting contrast) her stillness and her impulsiveness. Yet these elements do not gel into an authoritative portrayal. She etches no lines into memory, and her pianissimi are inaudible. Owen Teale's Bassanio is virile, ardent, personable, and yet he is too busy with a display of youthful excitability. I could not believe in any sexual chemistry between them, or between the other two couples. But these quibbles are petty against the revealing audacity of Thacker's production, which makes us see Shylock and Venice with new eyes.

Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, is understood to be anxious to keep the momentum of the law and order initiative going by securing a second Commons reading for a wide-ranging bill before Christmas. The tight timetable and the complexity of the work needed before the proposed investigating body can be set up acts against its inclusion. The Home Office is also hoping to secure a second reading for the Sunday trading bill before the new year. A police bill will ensure there is a pronounced law and order theme in the new session. If the investigating body is not included in the first draft of the criminal justice bill, it could possibly still be inserted either during that measure's committee stage or as part of the police bill. Neither is thought likely, however. The establishment of an independent review authority to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice and refer cases back to the Court of Appeal was recommended by the royal commission on criminal justice in July.

In the absence of a definition in this section, the Forest Service has relied on defining alcoholic beverage by reference to State law. The intention was to prohibit possession of all forms of alcoholic beverages when provided by an order; yet in some states, the definition of alcoholic beverages does not include beer and wine.

0,FT911-5255 ,"FT911-5255 _AN-BDOBBADFFT 910415   FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Brahms piano trios - Royal Festival Hall      By DAVID MURRAY   Brahms wrote five altogether, but two include a horn or clarinet. The other three employ the canonical violin and cello, and they add up to a solid programme, not least because they range so widely over the composer's career  -in fact the early B major Trio of 1854, op 8, was extensively re-composed some years after the far later Second and Third Trios had been published. To deliver the programme, who better than Vladimir Ashkenazy, Itzhak Perlman and Lynn Harrell? - all distinguished Brahms players, and keen collaborators as well as notable concert soloists. On Saturday, however, the Festival Hall seemed the wrong place for them. The hall was crowded; but human bodies soak up sound. Though one can hardly speak of 'the' Festival Hall acoustics, because they depend upon concert-by-concert adjustments to a great many concealed amplifiers, I can say that on Saturday the acoustics granted to the Ashkenazy team were dry and severely distancing. One wished the whole affair transplanted to the Wigmore Hall. In the op 87 Trio at the start, the strings' bald unison declamation - a device much used by piano-trio composers for forceful effect - seemed frail and remote. Then the piano-entry, which should be a rich revelation of the harmonic context, seemed just as wan. It was understandable that the ever-tactful Ashkenazy should choose to keep his piano lid half-closed - Perlman's violin is invincibly sweet, not aggressive, and Harrell's forte is introspective, quasi-vocal musing - but it didn't flatter Brahms's robustly impassioned piano-parts. The pianist allowed himself a few ringing outbursts - much of a muchness, actually, in whichever Trio - at sound, unarguable places. Otherwise he was content to supply sympathetic accompaniment to the strings well in front of him, who looked deeply into each other's eyes and played like a committed duo. The net effect was of performances excellently prepared en gros et en detail but probably much-recycled and by now polished to routine. At least there were properly fiery moments in the heroic C minor Trio, op 101; and in the B major work, which was their anti-chronological conclusion, there was enough imagination in the rapt Adagio and the Finale to let us conjecture how they might have sounded close-up. Must this repertoire go the way of the new maxi-audience operatic ventures - with similar musical losses? Why should subtle musicians find themselves delivering serious, narrow-gauge Brahms to a huge audience in the wrong kind of place? The gilt-embossed front cover of the programme-book said it all: 'celebrity chamber recital' (italics mine) - in the Festival Hall] If there are big concert halls that can offer friendly accommodation to chamber music, this one is not among them, except when performers have a Russian knack for enlarging chamber-gestures to an operatic scale. From a distance, I admired these performances sincerely; but I have heard much more exciting accounts of each Trio by less famous virtuosi - in halls of the right size.

Have you been able to learn what  is being done? What aid has the country received from the  international community?    [Castro] Not much here in Santiago de Cuba. The country  provided the money needed, especially to rebuild homes, repair  mattresses, to give the people back what they lost, to purchase  cement. Almost all has been done with money provided by the  country. Much has been done in Guantanamo, the most affected  province, Sagua, and Santiago. Guantanamo was strongly affected  by the rains. Just imagine what it was like to have 700  millimeters of rain fall on the area in 36 hours. This happened  in one municipality. It was tremendous. If affected the  coffee, tuber, and orchard crops. However, the storm of the  century caused more damage than these rains. The storm of the  century affected many provinces. However, this recent storm  caused much damage in Guantanamo. It destroyed thousands of  homes.    [Reporter] Years ago you made a speech at Cespedes Park. You  said that there was much for the Revolution to do in the future.  At that time, you said that the people had all their hopes set  on the rebel army and on you. However, you told them you did  not want to be a demagogue and admitted that difficult times lay  ahead. A few minutes ago you repeated those words.    [Castro] When I entered Havana on 8 January, I stressed that  even more. I warned the people that even more difficult times  lay ahead. I told the people that.    [Reporter] And you have repeated those same words today.    [Castro] I did. Being a demagogue would be lying to the  people. It would be a lie to tell the people that the problems  are small and that the path ahead is an easy one to travel.    [Reporter] Comparing....    [Castro, interrupts] We are enduring a test no other country  has ever endured. We are the only country to endure it; it is a  tremendous test.    [Reporter] In your opinion, [words indistinct] the  Revolution?    [Castro] As if we were starting all over again. The  struggle is much harder, but we have more people who are more  revolutionary, more aware, better prepared. This revolutionary  contingent must win this battle. It is better prepared and more  aware. No other country in the world has waged a battle as  difficult as the one Cuba has waged. We have been resisting the  empire for the past 35 years. That is an unheard of prowess. We  do not really realize what this has meant, what victoriously  resisting the United States for the past 35 years has meant.  The United States is trying to take advantage,  opportunistically take advantage of the fact that the socialist  bloc has disappeared. The most extraordinary thing is that  despite the disappearance of the socialist bloc, we continue to  challenge the United States and continue to wage our battle.  This is a first in the history of Cuba. I have no doubts that  this generation is waging the most difficult and most heroic  battle in Cuba's history. You, all of you, are waging this  battle.    [Reporter] Tell us how you spent the last day of the year.    [Castro] I spent the last day of the year meditating a bit  about today's event. I rested. I rested on the last day of the  year. It was a hectic and tiring month; I was tired. I knew  that I had to be here today, that I had to come here today. I  spent almost the whole day reading, but I was reading about  other things. I read about economics and international matters.  I also read a bit of fiction. What I did was rest. At  midnight I went to visit some friends.     "

(Proposed 6.6(a).)    In some cases, grantees contract with other entities (as opposed to individual contractors_see section III below) for the provision of health services. The typical situation is a subgrant or contract for the provision of the full range of health services. For example, the legislative history of Pub. L. 102501 describes the case of a grantee in the Los Angeles area which itself has no clinical staff, but which contracts with three primary care clinics for the actual delivery of services. If one (or more) of these clinics provides the full range of services mandated under section 330 to its own medically undeserved population, in accordance with other applicable requirements under section 330, it would be eligible for a determination by the Secretary that it too is a covered entity. (H.R. Rep. No. 102823, Part 2, p. 7, 102d Cong. 2d Sess., Sept. 14, 1992.) Proposed 6.3(b) provides that the Secretary will identify those contracting entities that will be subject to coverage under section 224(g) in notices issued pursuant to 6.5.        III. Covered Individuals        In addition to the entity itself, section 224(g) provides that certain individuals may be covered under the FTCA. Officers and employees are subject to coverage, as well as certain contractors.    Public Law 102501 provides that an individual may be considered to be a contractor of an entity described in Pub. L. 102501 only if_    (A) the individual normally performs on average at least 321/2 hours of service per week for the entity for the period of the contract; or    (B) in the case of an individual who normally performs on average less than 321/2 hours of services per week for the entity for the period of the contract and is a licensed or certified provider of obstetrical services_    (1) the individual's medical malpractice liability insurance coverage does not extend to services performed by the individual for the entity under the contract; or    (2) the Secretary finds that patients to whom the entity furnishes services will be deprived of obstetrical services if such individual is not considered a contractor of the entity for purposes of paragraph (1).    Coverage of individuals, whether employees of contractors, does not extend to acts or omissions that are not related to the grant supported activity. The covered entity itself (assuming it meets the statutory requirements for FTCA coverage) will be covered for claims against it, even if an individual health care practitioner is not covered in a particular case. Thus, for example, if a contractor works fewer than 321/2 hours and is not a provider of obstetrical services, the contractor would not be covered for services related to the grant, but the grantee itself would be covered.

0,FT923-2451 ,"FT923-2451 _AN-CIQC8ADEFT 920917   FT  17 SEP 92 / Arts: The Wild West exposed - Cinema      By STEPHEN AMIDON   UNFORGIVEN (15)Empire, Camden Plaza, MGMs West End A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN (PG) Odeon West End, MGMs Chelsea  Oxford St THE HOURS AND TIMES ICA Clint Eastwood's brilliant and harrowing Unforgiven packs all the punch of a good Western without indulging in the plot cliches and moral certitudes so often inherent in the genre. Eastwood, who at 62 seems to have reached his peak form as a director, seems finally to have gained the artistic confidence to toss such old chestnuts as the heroic gunslinger, righteous sheriff and good-hearted whore into the fire, where they proceed to explode in the audience's face. The film tells the story of ageing gunfighter, Bill Munny (Eastwood), who has become an apparently reformed farmer and family man. But things begin to go bad for him - his wife dies, followed by most of his herd of pigs. When the opportunity comes to make some fast money by killing two cowboys who allegedly mutilated a woman, Munny takes the job to insure his children's future. He enlists the help of his old sidekick, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) and sets out for the cowboys' hideout near Big Whiskey, a frontier town presided over by a tough sheriff (Gene Hackman). A familiar enough story to this point, though Eastwood and writer David Webb Peoples proceed to set the whole thing on its head, foregoing standard Western plot lines to expose the barbarism, cowardice and cruelty that must have lain at the heart of the real Old West. Munny's glory days as a gunfighter are gradually shown to be a prolonged spell of drunken, homicidal insanity in which good guys, bad guys, women and children were his victims. Indeed, when the time comes for him to engage in his first gunfight, it turns out to a repellent act of bushwhacking. The woman Munny and his friends are supposed to be avenging turns out to a whore whose injuries are far less serious than first thought. Even the good guys are shown to be corrupt - Hackman's sheriff turns out to be a sadist with no regard for the law. The mixture of these various rotten elements leads toward a finale in which characters meet their dismal fate with equal degrees of ignominy and damnation. The only one who makes a choice that could be called heroic ends up a cadaver left on display in Big Whiskey's main street. It is a grim picture lightened by fine acting, beautiful photography and, most of all, subversively mordant irony. Nothing is at it seems in Big Whiskey. It's worse. Richard Harris has a wonderful supporting role as English Bob, another hired gun who comes across as a gentleman gunfighter yet is soon exposed a cowardly assassin in the pay of railroad bosses. Munny is forced to confess that his drink-addled brain cannot recollect the deeds that made him famous, though it is this very past which comes back to seal his doom. Indeed, as a reformed character he is useless, falling off his horse, shooting poorly and losing fights. It is only when he goes back on the bottle that he becomes an effective gunman again. Most tellingly of all, there is the device of having a pulp writer (Saul Rubinek) to 'record' the whole bloody pageant, thereby allowing the audience to see how myopic, headline-grabbing eyes can transform barbarism into myth. Despite Eastwood's finely ironic touch, this must still be one of the bleakest films to ever top the American box office. Life in 1880's Wyoming is shown as being nasty, brutish and, for the lucky ones anyway, short. What looks at first to be a trot to redemption ends up a gallop into hell. True, there are some half-hearted attempts at Christian imagery - an ill Munny sleeps for three days before rising to meet his destiny, while Logan is strung up as if on a cross and whipped when captured. But these are merely teases - the film's ethos is ultimately Old Testament, with Eastwood's last words a unredeemed jeremiad that thunders through the streets of Big Whiskey. Yet, despite its bleakness, the film remains richly rewarding, peppered with the sort of memorable one-liners for which Eastwood is famous and ending with a shoot out that will not disappoint traditionalists. Just don't expect the good guys to ride off into the sunset. A League of Their Own combines wartime nostalgia, lots of baseball and an innocuous dose of feminism. It tells the story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, formed in 1943 when many male baseball players had gone off to war. Geena Davis portrays an Oregonian farm girl who is lured, along with her sister (Lori Petty), to play for the Rockford Peaches. After much initial scepticism on the part of fans and their hard-drinking coach (Tom Hanks), the women's grit and determination win the day. The film works best as a comedy, with especially funny turns by Jon Lovitz as a wise-cracking scout and Hanks as the drunken has-been player. There is also some gratifyingly skillful baseball. Davis performs well in the thankless role of the humourless head girl who just wants to go home and have babies, while Madonna, as the team's obligatory loose woman, wisely confines her efforts to providing strong supporting help. Director Penny Marshall once again proves herself to possess both a deft hand for light comedy and an unfortunate weakness for sentimentality. The Hours and Times is a wistful, well-acted drama about an imaginary weekend that John Lennon and Beatles manager Brian Epstein might have spent together in 1963. Set in Barcelona, the film concerns Epstein's attempts to confess his love and longing for Lennon, which the latter gently yet firmly rejects. Writer/director Christopher Munch has created a slow, knowing, often agonised film that has a lot more to do with Bergman than Help] He is greatly aided by Ian Hart's deft impersonation of the cocky yet sensitive Lennon and David Angus's considered portrayal of the tortured Epstein.

0,FT942-3945 ,"FT942-3945 _AN-EFMDJAA5FT 940613   FT  13 JUN 94 / Yeltsin acts to curb financial advertising      By LEYLA BOULTON      MOSCOW   Russian President Boris Yeltsin has issued a long-awaited decree banning dishonest advertising, which has enabled crooked financiers to make fortunes at the expense of gullible investors. The Russian Information Agency said a decree at the weekend, aimed primarily at extravagant promises made in TV and newspaper advertisements, prohibits companies from promising specific levels of future dividend payments or guarantees of the future performance of a given investment. Some observers believe that after seven decades of communist propaganda TV viewers in Russia's newly-developing market economy have proven vulnerable to perceiving advertising as fact. One investment fund which promised to turn citizens' privatisation vouchers into 'gold' was recently found to have defrauded investors of millions of dollars. Another suggested to investors they might make enough on a Rbs10,000 (Pounds 3.30) privatisation voucher to buy a house in Paris. Many small banks have attracted small savers with promises of astronomically high interest rates. But authorities say they have been powerless to stop television stations and newspapers from carrying advertising even months after it has been officially denounced as fraudulent. From now on, businesses can only advertise actual dividend and interest rates they have paid in the past. The decree, to be enforced by Russia's anti-monopoly committee, obliges advertisers to withdraw within three days any advertising found to violate the decree.

The  prohibited terrorist Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] turned  Germany into a theater-of-war: It controlled nationwide highway  blockades and attacked policemen, it laid fires, and had fanatic  compatriots set themselves on fire. [passage omitted]    As the Duesseldorf Higher Regional Court realized, since  1984  Germany has been the European focus of the PKK, which has its  headquarters in Cologne. About 500,000 Kurds have meanwhile  settled in Europe -- 400,000 of them in Germany. About 40,000  Kurds in Germany are classified as PKK sympathizers and about  400 as members. They entered the country legally as respectable  workers with Turkish citizenship, they came as asylum-seekers,  or they were illegally taken to Germany. [passage omitted]    The commander and secretary general of the Marxist-Leninist  ""cadre party,"" PKK, is Abdullah Ocalan. According to findings  of the German intelligence services, he is lodging, together  with his wirepullers, in Damascus in Syria.    ""The orders for attacks and demonstrations come from  abroad,""  Ernst Uhrlau, president of the Hamburg Office for the Protection  of the Constitution, says. A ""Central Committee"" of the PKK in  Europe coordinates the activities; the so-called area committees  are subordinate to it.    By Ocalan's order, the PKK organized six large-scale waves  of  attack in Western Europe and Germany in 1992 and 1993. About  600 perpetrators participated in about 50 attacks in  European-wide violent actions on 24 June 1993. On 4 November,  about 60 violent attacks of Kurds on Turkish institutions and  private houses were ascertained all over the FRG.    As a result, the PKK was banned in Germany. The 35 Kurdish  groups that were prohibited at the same time as the PKK have  disguised themselves with harmless names, but, according to  findings of Germany security authorities, they are in reality  arms of the PKK octopus that are registered as  ""suborganizations"" in the local registers of associations, such  as: ""Kurdistan Art and Cultural Center in Nuremberg and  surroundings -- registered association,"" ""Kurdish Women's Center  in Leverkusen -- registered association,"" ""International  Friendship in Munich -- registered association,"" ""Center of  Media Culture in Hagen -- registered association,"" ""Mesopotamian  Cultural Association in Bremen -- registered association,""  ""Kurdish Cultural Center in Hamburg and surroundings --  registered association,"" etcetera.    A Kurd called Kani Yilomaz, who acts on the direction of  Ocalan, acts as the spokesman of the PKK leadership in Europe.  It was he who propagated the PKK's preparedness to discontinue  its violent actions in Germany this week.    Apparently, the Kurds' drug deals in Germany yield enormous  profits for the war against Turkey. [passage omitted]    The second special field of the Kurds is the extortion of  protection money. With this method, they cash donations for  their political struggle.    In Berlin, where 50,000 Kurds live, Kurds and Turks are so  active in this field that the police established a special  investigation group in March 1993. Hans-Ulrich Voss, managing  director of the Berlin Criminal Investigation Department,  described how the collection of donations works: ""First"" PKK  representative approach businessmen ""very politely"" and ask for  ""donations"" for the struggle for liberation. DM200 are  requested from owners of kebab stalls, while owners of travel  agencies and insurance agencies have to pay up to DM20,000 --  these amounts are often requested every month.    Turkish private persons are visited at home late at night.  Their donations are calculated according to the size of the  Turkish family's car. Hesitant victims are brought to heel by  referring to one's knowledge of the children's route to school.    The shop windows of those Turks who still refuse to pay are  broken or incendiary devices are thrown into the shops. With  such attacks, the Kurds achieve a welcome additional effect:  According to initial appearances, German right-wing extremists  are initially blamed for such attacks.    However, the Berlin special investigation group discovered:  ""Collectors of donations"" from Turkey, not -- as originally  assumed -- xenophobic Germans, are responsible for many  destroyed shop windows and arson attacks in Berlin-Kreuzberg.    According to Berlin experiences, only about 10 percent of  the  victims admit that they have been blackmailed; 10 percent claim  that they pay ""voluntary donations."" The rest, 80 percent, are  silent.    In Frankfurt on Main, the Municipal Office granted licenses  for 2,500 ""public houses and restaurants"" -- 40 percent of which  were to foreigners. Frankfurt senior detective officer Roland  Ullmann estimates that ""there is hardly anybody who does not  pay.""     "

By the luck of the draw for this critic, short-story collections have been  pouring in, so that in the space of a week, like a drunk on a binge, I've gone  through six of them: stories about the homeless, stories ""from the rest of the  world,"" stories by Carol Emshwiller, Susan Dodd and perhaps the current  reigning queen of this form, Joy Williams.    At some level, it's a little like drinking 27 whiskey sours, or eating 18 bags  of chocolate bit cookies. The short stories are the refuge of heightened  sensitivities, the apercu in spades; the tragic random incidents, the  gratuitous fortune. The short story also searches for, and sometimes finds, the  quick-fix shortcut to enlightenment.    But there are only so many misfortunes in this world, only so many apercus,  unfortunately, and our metaphors for magic moments are cruelly limited. Thus,  when you read the title story here, ""Escapes,"" in which a girl on the edge of  adulthood ponders the performance of a provincial magician and understands  there are some things magic can't fix, it's not Joy Williams' fault that right  next door to her on the short-story shelf, Mary Bush has written a vignette in  which a girl on the edge of adulthood ponders the performance of a provincial  magician -- and so on.    When Williams writes a story about ""The Blue Men,"" in which the controlling  metaphor is the Taureg, that splendid set of nomadic North Africans where the  men go veiled and the women reveal their forearms when they want to insult  someone -- those gaudy, unregenerate Taureg who live by their wits in the  impenetrable desert! -- it isn't Williams' fault that, in this same month,  Ibrahim Al-Kouni has used the Taureg for that same purpose in one of his  stories.    And when Joy Williams uses crib death or the death of a child to cut to the  tragedy in a page or two, it's not her fault if the death of a child in the  short story world this season is as prevalent as the common cold in the real  world.    Williams' strength is in her purity of writing, her elegant melancholia.  There's a lot of elegant agony, Joan Didion agony, in these stories: ""At the  bottom of the bank, a flat stream moved laboriously around fine covered trees.  The mud glistened in the sun. Blackberries grew in the brush. This place had a  lot of candor, Gloria thought."" Gloria is picnicking with a woman she doesn't  like, but that isn't the half of it. She also has an inoperable brain tumor,  and she's only in her 30s.    Later, in another story, another woman rests in ""a simple and pleasant"" room.  ""It seemed to Joan the kind of room in which someone was supposed to be getting  better."" Joan's problem? Two children lost to crib death, but who's counting?    Every once in a while, Williams gets funny. Parts of ""Gurdjieff in the Sunshine  State"" are funny. Not witty, but funny, as if a movie queen were to break  unexpectedly through her icy beauty and tell a bawdy joke. ""Lu-lu,"" the story  of an elderly couple, a lonely woman and a snake with a bad personality, is  very funny. But when you look to see if Williams will let herself be funny  again, she's already back to elegant melancholia.    These stories seem retro, as if the author is saying that the human condition  is hopeless and our only weapons with which to address this condition are  insight, intelligence, misery and style.    The short-story form is not a place where characters have room to act, to move,  to fight. They can only register what happens, take it on the chin.    Williams is a gorgeous writer and a master of the short story. And reading  these short stories is wonderful, just like drinking whiskey sours at sunset,  except that after the sixth one, you begin to feel dizzy and ill. You long for  some fresh air. Or a heroic act. Some Alka Seltzer, or a helicopter rescue.

By the luck of the draw for this critic, short-story collections have been  pouring in, so that in the space of a week, like a drunk on a binge, I've gone  through six of them: stories about the homeless, stories ""from the rest of the  world,"" stories by Carol Emshwiller, Susan Dodd and perhaps the current  reigning queen of this form, Joy Williams.    At some level, it's a little like drinking 27 whiskey sours, or eating 18 bags  of chocolate bit cookies. The short stories are the refuge of heightened  sensitivities, the apercu in spades; the tragic random incidents, the  gratuitous fortune. The short story also searches for, and sometimes finds, the  quick-fix shortcut to enlightenment.    But there are only so many misfortunes in this world, only so many apercus,  unfortunately, and our metaphors for magic moments are cruelly limited.

The controversial military courts have now condemned 27 militants to death since President Hosni Mubarak resorted to them last December to ensure swift punishment for militants carrying out acts of violence aimed at toppling the government. Fifteen of the condemned men have been hanged, five are in custody and seven are fugitives. The two sentenced to death by a three-judge court in Cairo yesterday were among eight accused of trying to kill army General Osman Shahin in an ambush in Cairo on July 18. The general escaped unhurt but six people, including a policeman and a militant, were killed in a shootout. The young men were members of the militant el-Gama'a el-Islamiya (Islamic Group) which has claimed responsibility for many of the bomb attacks in Egypt's worst political violence for a decade. Egypt has been criticised by human rights groups in recent months for carrying out its largest wave of executions for political crimes in decades. At least 193 people have now been killed in political violence since March last year and 510 injured. The Dollars 3bn tourism industry has been devastated by militant attacks.

In its  contacts, the Jordanian Government held Israel responsible for  the incident and its consequences. It urged the international  community to assume its responsibilities toward putting an end  to such acts that desecrate holy places, terrorize secure  citizens, and escalate violence.    In this context, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state  for  foreign affairs, summoned separately the ambassadors of the UN  permanent member states -- the United States, the United  Kingdom, France, China, and Russia -- the ambassador of Greece,  in its capacity as the current chairman of the European Union,  and the ambassador of Indonesia, the current chairman of the  Nonaligned Movement, to his office in the Foreign Ministry. He  conveyed to them the Jordanian Government's condemnation and  denunciation of this criminal incident against innocent,  defenseless worshipers and the violation of the sanctity of holy  places. The Jordanian Government held Israel fully responsible  for this massacre and urged it to conduct an immediate  investigation, since it provides for the settlers' weapons,  freedom of movement, and access to holy places.

The ratification  of the agreement, which was concluded in 1988, cannot be  approved ""because of the continuing human rights violations"" in  Iran and because of the fact that the death threat against  author Salman Rushdie has not been retracted. Because of  Germany's federal system, the ratification of cultural  agreements requires the approval of the laender.

Yao Kaiwen  and Gao Xiaoliang were found guilty of ""organising and leading a  counter- revolutionary group"" by the Shanghai Intermediate Court  on December 23.    Meanwhile the authorities have released Yang Zhou, a member  of the Beijing-based peace charter movement after detaining him  without charge for 45 days in a centre for tramps and migrant  workers.    Sources in Shanghai said last night Yao, 53, a former  teacher, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and deprivation of  ""political rights"" for three years. Gao, 28, a former worker,  got a nine-year jail term in addition to a two-year suspension  of his rights.    The verdict said the two, who were detained last May, had in  late 1992 organised a counter-revolutionary ring called the  Mainland Headquarters of the Democratic China Front. A third  organiser of the group, Yao Tiansheng, was released last  September after a four- month detention.    The three-page verdict reportedly said that last September,  Yao Kaiwen drafted a 10-point manifesto whose aim was ""ending  the dictatorial rule of the communist regime"". The manifesto  allegedly said the front was ready to take ""peaceful and bloody,  legal and illegal, domestic and foreign-aided actions"" to  further their goals of promoting democracy.    Prosecution authorities in Shanghai also accused Gao and the  two Yaos of hatching an ""anti-government"" plot while meeting in  a small local park last November. The trio reportedly discussed  an action plan which included street demonstrations, forming  brigades of workers, occupying radio and TV stations, and  detaining municipal party and government leaders.    The verdict said: The three were the ""core organisers"" of  the front and that ""they had decided upon their division of  labour"". It also said the group had mapped out plans to publish  an illegal journal called Free China.    Summing up the Government's case, court officials claimed  that the accused had admitted their actions, which amounted to  ""attempts to topple the administration of the people's  democratic dictatorship as well as the socialist order"". They  said the heavy sentences were called for because the two had  committed their ""crimes"" less than three years after being  released from re-education through labour camps.    Yao Kaiwen, who was an individual entrepreneur upon his  detention, spent 18 months in a labour camp after having been  found guilty in early 1990 of trying to smuggle himself out of  China. And Gao, who used to work at a pharmaceutical factory,  was given a two-year term in August 1989 for taking part in the  pro-democracy movement.    Members of China's dissident community said last night they  were shocked by the severity of the sentences. Friends of Gao  and Yao said they belonged to the relatively radical fringe of  the democracy movement. ""There is no evidence to suggest the  front has ever had more than four or five active members,"" a  Shanghai source said. ""That adherents of the front do not seem  to have ruled out acts of violence in their theoretical  discussions does not mean they will actually commit them."" The  source added that even if accusations made by the prosecution  were true, the punishment was severe because the organisation  had never put their ideas into action.    Meanwhile, on New Year's Eve, authorities in Shanghai freed  Mr. Yang, one of nine dissidents who put down their names to a  draft of the peace charter released in Beijing on November 14.  The so-called peace charter movement espouses ""national  reconciliation"" through a non-violent campaign for a multi-party  system.    Mr. Yang, whose activism dates to the late 1970s, was  detained by Beijing police hours after the release of the  document. The dissident was held in a centre for tramps and  transients in Beijing until December 5, when he was taken under  guard to a similar facility in Shanghai. However, another  signatory of the charter, Wuhan-based activist Qin Yongmin, who  was arrested together with Mr. Yang, is believed to be detained  in the central China city.    Mr. Yang, who said he lost a tooth and a few kilograms  during  his ordeal, said it was illegal for the authorities to hold him  in a centre for illegal migrant workers. ""I had no recourse to  the judicial process and I was not allowed to contact my  family,"" he said in his Shanghai apartment yesterday. Mr. Yang  said he would continue his non-violent campaign for democracy,  warning that Beijing's continued refusal to tolerate the  peaceful expression of dissent could spawn acts of violence by  more radical factions of the movement.

[Begin Rene Saa Vidal, Drugs Control Board spokesman,  recording] One main concern was the fact Congress did not  approve the Vienna Convention, which had been presented for  approval in 1992, due to pressure exerted on the extradition  issue, especially.    The investigations that Congress made years ago, as well as  recently, about how certain congressmen are directly involved  with drug traffickers have led the board to affirm there is a  continuous concern over the fact that drug traffickers are  trying to exert influence in parliament. [end recording]    The board has also denounced the vast corruptive clout drug  traffickers have in countries where there are drug-trafficking  activities. Concerning Colombia, the board has found evidence  that certain cartel men have infiltrated the Attorney General's  Office.

This summer it was ""Another 48 HRS.,"" ""Die Hard 2,"" etc. -- same plot, new  settings . . . perhaps fun with your brain in reverse but beyond belief.    Years ago, at least in the first three James Bond pictures, the plots were  different and the villains interesting. Everyone who has ever seen ""Goldfinger""  remembers Auric Goldfinger and Oddjob. But over the years who remembers the  villains of ""For Your Eyes Only"" or ""Octopussy""?    Sequels merely rehash what we found out in the original (the exception being  ""Godfather II"").    With the X-rating problem, which is hurting many small creative films and  prompting the mind-set of having to spend megabucks on making a film, I see  fewer and fewer ""little"" films and less creative and risky projects. I'm not  sure that a Woody Allen could break into Hollywood today. And wouldn't that be  a loss?    STEVE BROWN    Highland      Letter to the Editor    "

India, in its first right of reply  at the United Nations Human Rights Commission session here, said  that the statement made by the leader of the Pakistani  delegation, Mr. Iqbal Akhund regarding the self-determination of  the Kashmiri people is ""neither justified nor factual.""    The former foreign secretary and envoy, Mr. T.N. Kaul, who  exercised the right to reply said that Mr. Akhund's statement  more closely reflected the ""condition of people living in  Pakistan occupied Kashmir and the northern territories where  free and fair elections have not been held so far, where  fundamental freedoms are suppressed ruthlessly.""    ""Even inside Pakistan, atrocities committed by Pakistani  army  and security forces in Sindh, Baluchistan, and the Frontier  Provinces are well known,"" he said while objecting to Pakistan  internationalising bilateral problems thereby making a solution  more difficult.    Referring to the Shimla agreement signed when he was foreign  secretary, Mr. Kaul said that what Pakistan was doing for the  last four years was a blatant violation of this pact. It had set  up training bases in PoK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir] and in  Pakistan itself for militants armed and financed and guided to  commit acts of sabotage, subversion, loot and arson in both  Punjab and J and K. ""They have failed in Punjab and are failing  in Jammu and Kashmir also. Hence, their attempt to  internationalise the issue,"" he added.    Stating that he was born and brought up in Kashmir, unlike  Mr. Iqbal Akhund, and some who did not even speak the Kashmiri  language but claimed to be Kashmiris, Mr. Kaul rejected the  accusation that ""India's terrorism in Kashmir was supported by  draconian laws.""    ""When misguided youths and local insurgents are aided,  abetted instigated by a neighbouring country to commit loot,  arson, rape and murder and drive at the point of the gun,  minorities and even Muslims who do not agree with them, from  their hearths and homes, no government worth its salt can shirk  its duty to protect the people against such acts,"" Mr. Kaul  replied.    Till the end of 1993, over 11,000 Kalashnikovs, 700 machine  guns, 600 rocket launchers, 15,000 hand grenades besides  wireless sets, rockets and a lot of ammunition and explosives  had been captured, all supplied by the Pakistan ISI  [Inter-Services Intelligence] to the insurgents, he said. A  recently captured foreign mercenary admitted to having raped 85  women, all Muslims, as there were hardly any non-Muslim women  left in the valley.    Ms. Karen Parker of the International Educational  Development, an NGO, demanded that, the promised plebiscite in  Kashmir be conducted now so that the 40-year old UN resolution  could be implemented. ""The occupying power responds with the  barrel of the gun, 600,000 strong, aimed at the Kashmiri people.  Is this what the Commission means by democratic process?"" she  asked. The Kashmiris may not have oil, unlike Kuwait, but they  had a passionate yearning for their promised plebiscite, she  said.    The NGOs from Pakistan who spoke on the subject were Dr.  (Ms.) Attiya Inayatullah of the World Muslim Congress and Mr.  Syed Nazir Gilani of the World Society of Victimology. Mr.  Gilani said that ""while armed separatists were said to be  responsible for kidnapping and killing government officials as  well as members of the paramilitary forces and civilians,  serious concerns had also been expressed over a large number of  killings by the Indian security forces. Victims of torture  included policemen, he said. The UN had procrastinated in its  will and India had frustrated every opportunity to investigate  the breach of these violations, he said.    Dr. Inayatullah, who has created some controversy because of  her being chairman of the executive board of UNESCO as well as  adopting the role of an NGO, relied on statistics provided by  the All Parties Hurriyet Conference to depict the human rights  situation in the Valley and called Dr. Farooq Abdullah a  ""quisling"".    In an oral intervention by International Pen, the world  association of writers representing members in 87 countries, Ms.  F. Assaad said that Pen did not condemn anti-terrorist  legislation per se and indeed recognised that legal  measures were by far the most effective instrument in the  struggle against violent insurgency. However, it was concerned  that such legislation often including clauses which could lead  to violations of the rights of those not advocating violence. In  India, TADA [Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act]  contained clauses which penalised the right of freedom of  expression. It stated that such acts included views through  speech or any other media.      "

Collecting data on females aged 1221 will allow for comparisons with other SAMHSA programs targeting females.     In identifying female adolescents who are ``at risk'' for ATOD use, CSAP proposes this framework for considering risk (See Resnick, 1993):     Risk factors are: (1) Those environmental forces that have a negative impact on the individual by producing an increased vulnerability to ATOD use. These include family dysfunction, including childhood physical/sexual abuse and incest; high risk neighborhoods/environments; and poverty.     (2) Those visible indicators of problems in individuals, which represent the onset of potentially negative behaviors related to ATOD use and other negative outcomes. These may often be found in public records, and include poor school performance and involvement with child protective services, such as out-of-home placement in the foster care system.     Risk factors for the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs may be found in six domains: The individual, the family, the school, peer groups, the neighborhood/community, and society.     Primary prevention efforts for ATOD use should identify female adolescents who are affected by multiple risk factors (environmental forces and visible indicators). Secondary prevention efforts should target female adolescents who may have already initiated ATOD use or have engaged in other problem behaviors such as early sexual activity, truancy, or running away from home.     Recommended Approach: CSAP encourages applicants to develop comprehensive programs that will address one or more of the following questions:     1. What combination of strategies is most effective in improving the self-image, including body image, and the   generalized self-esteem and self-efficacy of female adolescents?     2. What combination of strategies is most effective in developing the competencies or life skills of female adolescents in such areas as intra/interpersonal communications and problem-solving?     3. Which combination of strategies is most effective in improving the family functioning and strengthening the families of female adolescents, and increasing adolescents' levels of parenting skills so that they will be prepared to parent effectively and appropriately when they have children?     4. What combination of strategies is most effective in combatting the long-lasting effects of sexual abuse/assault?     5. What combination of strategies is most effective in promoting healthy life styles and life skills (e.g., negotiation, conflict-handling, self-assertion) among female adolescents?     These questions are in addition to the ATOD-specific questions listed in the Outcome Evaluation section of Part IV.     Applicants are asked to involve representatives of youth and others in the community to: (1) Identify the risk factors for ATOD use that are to be addressed in the project and (2) select the appropriate interventions.     Successful interventions should also impact not only on ATOD use, but on other negative outcomes associated with ATOD use. Related negative outcomes include adolescent pregnancy and parenting;     HIV/AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases; adolescent mental disorders, including eating disorders and depression; suicide; violent acts and criminal justice involvement; and homelessness. CSAP is especially interested in programs which will address physical/sexual abuse, teen pregnancy, and HIV/AIDS and STDs, in addition to ATOD use.     Contact for Additional Information: Ulonda B.

CSAP recognizes that substance abuse is both correlated with and causes violence and that, in turn, violence give rise to substance abuse. Thus, substance abuse and violence are inextricably intertwined. Violence may be understood as any act that causes psychological, emotional, or physical harm to individuals and/or communities, or that causes damage to property. In this context, violence arises from substance use and abuse, the trade in illicit substances, racism, misogyny, homophobia, among other factors, and results in homicide; assaults, including rape and sexual assault; spouse abuse and battering; child physical and sexual abuse; child neglect; suicide; and vandalism and other forms of property destruction. This broad CSAP definition of violence illustrates the fact that violence affects its victims, witnesses, and perpetrators.     CSAP recognizes that violence is linked to a host of social and health problems that plague many communities; however, the Center is particularly concerned with the relationship of violence to the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs.

There  were 43 attacks on persons, or 10 percent more than in January  (when there were 34) and February (when there were 32).  Fortunately, there was a considerable decrease in the number of  persons killed. The attacks in March caused 17 deaths. Twelve  involved presumed subversives, four were civilians, and one was  a member of the armed forces.    Lima continued to be the area where the largest number of  subversive actions took place. A total of 27 (63 percent) of the  attacks took place here. In March two periods of time were  preferred for subversive activity: the middle and the end of the  month. Shining Path [SL] carried out two waves of attacks,  including a series which took place during two weeks in the  middle of March as part of a ""subversive celebration"" to  commemorate two anniversaries: the attack on the CRAS [Social  Rehabilitation Center--after prison training center] in Ayacucho  and the establishment of Socorro Popular [People's Assistance  Organization, the SL equivalent of the Red Cross]. The wave of  attacks which took place during the last few days of March  involved a series of actions in anticipation of the anniversary  of the coup d'etat of 5 April.    Most of the attacks in Lima involved acts of sabotage  against  branch banks, supermarkets, and high voltage electricity pylons.  However, the most serious action involved the detonation of a  tricycle bomb in the home of Patricio Ricketts, a journalist.    In second place in terms of acts of political violence was a  three-way tie between the subversives' Principal, Norte, and  Centro [Principal, North, and Center] regions. Four attacks (9  percent of the total) took place in each region.    In the Principal region there were three raids on towns in  the Province of Acobamba and an act of terror in the Province of  Huancasancos in which the governor of the province was wounded.    In the Norte region subversives attacked the local  headquarters of a company which repairs highways, murdered a  local official, and incited a mob to lynch a group of farmers.  Finally, two members of the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary  Movement] were captured when they attempted to break into a  house.    In the Centro region there were two clashes, one of them  initiated by the Army and the other by indigenous people of the  Ashaninka tribe. At the same time subversives sabotaged electric  lines in the Valle del Mantaro area.    In third and last place a tie was also recorded between the  Regional Committees of La Selva and Sur, with two attacks each  (5 percent of the total).    In La Selva region there was a clash and a deliberately  targeted murder, whereas in the Sur region there was also a  clash in Orurillo, Province of Puno. The subversives detonated  explosives against a special project.    Regarding persons killed, the leading area was the Centro  region, with 13 persons killed (72 percent of the total). These  figures include subversive deaths in clashes with the security  forces and with a group of indigenous people of the Ashaninka  tribe.    In second place as far as persons killed are concerned were  the Lima and La Selva regions, with two each (11 percent of the  total). The two civilians killed in Lima died in the attack on  the home of Patricio Ricketts, a journalist, while in La Selva  region a sergeant in the Army died in a clash with subversives  and a farmer was murdered for not paying taxes levied by the SL.    Finally, in last place in terms of persons killed was the  Norte region, with one person dead (six percent of the total).  This was the murder of the mayor of Huaylillas, in the Province  of Pataz.

In third and last place, a tie was also recorded between the  Regional Committees of La Selva and Sur, with two attacks each  (5 percent of the total).    In La Selva region, there was a clash and a deliberately  targeted murder, whereas in the Sur region there was also a  clash in Orurillo, Province of Puno. The subversives detonated  explosives against a special project.    Regarding persons killed, the leading area was the Centro  region, with 13 persons killed (72 percent of the total). These  figures include subversive deaths in clashes with the security  forces and with a group of indigenous people of the Ashaninka  tribe.    In second place, as far as persons killed are concerned were  the Lima and La Selva regions, with two each (11 percent of the  total). The two civilians, killed in Lima, died in the attack on  the home of Patricio Ricketts, a journalist, while in La Selva  region, a Army sergeant died in a clash with subversives and a  farmer was murdered for not paying taxes levied by the SL.    Finally, in last place in terms of persons killed was the  Norte region, with one person dead (six percent of the total).  This was the murder of the mayor of Huaylillas, in the Province  of Pataz.

Representatives of the Supreme Command Headquarters led by  Lieutenant Chiradet Diphian, director of the Supreme Command  Headquarters Intelligence Department, filed a lawsuit with  Police Major General Wannarat Khotcharat, commander of the  Police Crime Suppression Division, against General Vang Pao,  General Thonglit Chokbengbun, and their colleagues for having  set up outlaw organizations -- the Lao National Liberation Front  and the Lao National Liberation Army -- in Thailand. The two  organizations are responsible for acts of terrorism along the  border with Laos in Phayao and Nan Provinces.    Police Major General Wannarat disclosed that the police  director general had assigned him to appoint a working team to  investigate this case. He said he is confident that the two  accused will be brought to trial, although the military has  reported that they are now living outside the country.    Meanwhile, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak reaffirmed  that the Thai Government is always ready to cooperate with the  Lao Government in the suppression of terrorism in Laos.

This  draft code has been prepared by a group of lawyers known as the  Codification Directorate. The completion of the draft civil  code has been followed by the draft penal code, which will soon  go to the government for approval and subsequently to the  Albanian parliament. Before this draft code goes to the  government, it has been sent for discussion, by order of  Minister Cela, to the Higher Appeal Court, the  procurator-general, the Public Order Ministry, and the Tirana  Law Faculty. The aim is to sound out the views of specialists  in the field and to apply as closely as possible the Law on  Basic Human Rights and Freedoms and all the international acts  that Albania has signed.    This draft code has gone to pains to preserve the categories  of the existing Penal Code, which came into effect in 1977 and  led to serious consequences in the unfair conviction of a huge  number of Albanians. However, the group preparing it has tried  to change some things. For instance, the old code was divided  into chapters, but now we have headings. The new idea of  sections has also been added. The old code had 250 articles in  all, whereas the new one has been able to provide for a series  of crimes that were unknown under the old order.    The draft penal code is divided into two parts, one general  and one particular. The general part describes the basic  principles of Albanian penal justice, in which one is struck by  the inclusion of the punishments of iife imprisonment and fines.  This latter is a new notion in criminal justice, as far as  crimes are concerned. The code provides for fines of between  5,000 and 1 million leks for crimes and between 1,000 and  100,000 leks for misdemeanors. The general part includes 73  articles assembled under eight headings, compared to the 42  articles of the existing code.    As for the part on the particulars of the code, it must be  said that the group has been at great pains to include all the  different varieties of crime that have occurred in recent years  and which are expected to occur in the future.    This part begins with the heading on crimes against human  life and concludes with crimes affecting free elections and the  democratic electoral system. The 254 articles are assembled  under 10 headings, with many special sections. Under the first  heading of this part, which deals with crimes against human  life, one is struck by the new division of murder into  premeditated murder and wilful murder. This is a new notion  that was not present in the previous code, but the new code does  not explain the distinction between these two.    In another section, the age of 14 remains the limit for the  notion of acts of indecency. Despite the changes that have  taken place in Albania, and are still occurring, not all of them  have found a place in this draft code. For instance,  homosexuality continues to be prosecuted as an act of indecency,  at a time when many European states allow homosexuals to marry  freely. There are special articles forbidding pornography,  including the creation of conditions for pornography and the  import, publication, and sale of pornographic material.    A new section has been opened to cover crimes against  freedom  of religion. We now find three articles defending what the 1976  Constitution and other laws forbade. There are also new kinds  of crime and special sections in the area of bankruptcy and  crimes against the environment.    What is most striking in this draft code is the special  protection given to state personalities. Thus Heading 8 covers  ""crimes aimed against the authority of the state."" The chairmen  of the parliament and government and the president himself are  named as the highest authorities. Thus Articles 169-170 state  that ""Insulting the president of the Republic is punishable by  two years' imprisonment or a fine, and an insult in public by  between six months' and three years' imprisonment. Slander  against the president is punishable by three to five years'  inprisonment. There is thus special protection for the figure  of the head of state. [no concluding quotation marks as  published]    Thus it is hoped that the new draft penal code, completed on  10 March 1994, will soon pass to the government for approval and  thence to the parliament. There only remains the final word  from the specialists of the institutions to whom the draft has  been passed. Its approval as soon as possible is of pressing  urgency.     "

The project is being funded by ICI Paints, the BQ DIY retail chain and BP Oil. It will be run by Leeds City Council. The rubbish will be collected by a mobile 'wastewagon' that has cost nearly Pounds 25,000. If the experiment works the backers expect the scheme to be introduced by other councils although the costs would have to be borne by the public sector out of national and council taxes. Some wastes pose environmental problems if they are put out with normal household rubbish and garbage. They may not be suit-able for safe incineration at low temperatures or, if buried in landfill sites, they may react years later during decomposition to give off poisonous fumes. Local authorities are also becoming concerned at people pouring solvents or other liquid wastes down drains or lavatories.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

A funny thing happened on the way to the '90s -- ""student activism"" lost its  status as an oxymoron.    Since around 1987, campus protests have grown bigger, more frequent and better  organized than in years past. At UC Irvine, a campus known better for its  apathy than activism, protests and rallies drawing hundreds of students are no  longer the rarity they once were. And in recent months, smaller protests have  become almost routine.    As protests have become more frequent, protesters have grown more tenacious.  They are more inclined to get themselves arrested for acts of civil  disobedience than before and to endure physical hardship during round-the-clock  vigils, protests at remote locations and inclement weather.    For these reasons, some people contend the '60s have returned to college  campuses for an encore of student political involvement. They cite the recent  surge in high-profile activism as evidence that the pendulum finally has swung  back.    However, that's probably reading too much into recent events. Student activists  are still a small minority on most campuses, and even with their considerable  vigor, there is no evidence that their ranks have swelled. The real change is  that they are pursuing their goals with much greater sophistication.    They have formed stable, efficient groups with clearly defined objectives and  methods. Because these groups often support several causes and maintain a loose  affiliation with other activist organizations of a similar political bent, they  can produce consistently sizable demonstrations even without energetic support  from the majority of students.    Few details are now overlooked in planning protests. How signs should be  phrased and precisely what will be said to the media are decided beforehand to  ensure the group appears unified in purpose. These procedures, coupled with the  desire for advance publicity to guarantee a large turnout, all but preclude  spontaneity at many student protests.    In several recent cases, protest leaders have gone to the point of conferring  with the police on the time and place acts of civil disobedience will take  place and the number of protesters who wish to be arrested.    For their part, the police, who wish to appear reasonable and avert potential  violence, are often cooperative to the point of appearing as willing  participants. One recent protest at UCI appeared almost scripted. Having  discussed the arrest procedure with the activists beforehand, police allowed  protesters to block the entrance of a building for 10 minutes before giving the  first verbal warning. After the first 10-minute delay, police read a statement  warning students that arrests would be made in 10 minutes if they didn't  disperse.    If '60s-style activism has returned to college campuses, it's back with an  '80s-style self-consciousness -- and an acute awareness of the media's role in  shaping public opinion.    Recently, during a protest at a Nevada nuclear test site, activists purposely  scheduled their action hoping to make it convenient for a Los Angeles Times  reporter working on deadline to get their protest into the next day's edition.  Soon after, a last-minute proposal to move the protest to another site prompted  the group to ask reporters whether that would interfere with their ability to  cover the demonstration. Reporters refused to aid in the planning of the  action, and protesters decided not to gamble on changing locations.    While some activists pride themselves on creating considerable public awareness  of their causes, others remain ambivalent and question whether the methods  cheapen the message. A few students have suggested that their demonstrations  may be in danger of becoming ""McProtests"" -- triumphs of slick packaging with  scant substance.    For all that, though, demonstrations do seem to be contagious. Students who do  not generally identify themselves as activists are now more likely to organize  one-time protests to publicize their gripes. But these are geared more often  toward venting frustration over crowded classrooms or dormitories, for example,  than effecting political or social change.    Longtime student activists are probably indirectly responsible for the  increased number of one-shot protests by fostering an environment in which  demonstrations are considered a conventional method of addressing problems.  Ironically, because of this, some previously inactive students who chafed in  silence at the demands made by activists have begun to stage counter-protests  of their own.    As the '90s begin, the number of activists is sure to grow, but whether they  ever become a majority or even a sizable percentage of the student population  is doubtful. However, their impact will continue to be felt as long as  demonstrations call attention to issues many students would otherwise ignore.    And although the '90s may earn a deserved reputation for its own brand of  student activism, the '60s won't be back this way for a while.

The law also stipulates such issues as  social insurance, trade unions and their roles, labour disputes,  state management on labour, state labour inspection and  punishment for labour law breaking.    The chapter on settlement of labour disputes including the  issue of strike caused hot discussions. The law provides that  strike shall be decided by the executive committee of the trade  union at grassroots level with more than half of its secret  votes or signatures in favour.

0,FT932-8947 ,"FT932-8947 _AN-DEPANAF3FT 930515   FT  15 MAY 93 / Records: The sound of French Baroque - Ronald Crichton on a new 'Castor et Pollux' and a re-issued 'Faust'      By RONALD CRICHTON   WILLIAM Christie's recordings with his group Les Arts Florissants are as eagerly awaited as those of John Eliot Gardiner with his London forces. Both excel in bringing style, sympathy and vitality to the fascinating but not foolproof world of French Baroque theatre music. Christie's new Castor et Pollux (HMC 9014353/37, 3 CDs) is well up to standard. Rameau's drama of the half-brothers (sons of Leda, but Pollux's father was divine Jupiter) and the Princess Telare whom they both love is presented with clarity and tautness also with tenderness and relaxation when needed for the dazzling changes of mood and colour in Rameau's skilfully assembled and contrasted divertissements. The dialogues, in recitative with brief airs, are done with spirit and point - following them with the text (English translation provided) makes all the difference. Castor is Howard Crook, a fine high tenor often admired in music of this period, the voice gaining in strength. Brother Pollux is the baritone Jerome Correas, less assured at first but warming up to a deeply account account of the big aria 'Nature, Amour'. As Telare, Agnes Mellon sings the famous 'Tristes apprets' with admirable control. Mellon's voice, too, is gaining in strength and richness. Veronique Gens is a most effective Phebe, an unsympathetic character for whom one nevertheless feels rather sorry. The sonorous Jupiter of Rene Schirrer might with advantage have been placed further from the others - one does not feel he is singing ex machina. Sandrine Piau does full justice to three of the demanding small roles with which stud the score, Mark Padmore likewise catches the attention in two more. Rameau's chorus writing is testing as well as brilliant. The ensembles here are sung with notable trenchancy and rapidity of articulation. The version used is the original of 1737, as given in the Durand score. The music is a joy: only the athletes' dances fail a little below the general level, but perhaps routine triads and trumpets are what those Spartans deserve. I was brought up on the early version and on the whole prefer it while admitting that (as the English Bach Festival Castor at Covent Garden in 1981 memorably showed) the ending from the later, 1754 revision, reflective rather than jubilant, is the more moving of the two finales. Re-issues on CD from the age of 78s continue to throw up treasure. Of major interest is the (almost) complete Faust made in Paris in 1930, conducted by Gounod's friend and pupil, Henri Busser (re-mastered by Ward Marston for Pearl, GEMM CDS 9987, 2 CDs). The sound is elderly and uneven, but so clear is Busser's exposition (this is the 'old' Faust with recitatives) and so high the standard of singing that one soon forgets. The Mephistopheles of Marcel Journet was famous. What a voice, even throughout the range, full of colour, zest and verbal inflections, with plebeian mockery peeping out from beneath a 'gentlemanly' exterior. The bronze-toned Cesar Vezzani's Faust is more heroic than lyrical, a fine example of its kind. Mireille Berthon, a very experienced soprano, is equally apt to the girlish side of Marguerite, the roulades of the Jewel Song and the drama of the church and prison scenes. She lacked a strong vocal personality. Valentin is Louis Musy, a sterling singer who no more shows the unpleasant side of the character than Vezzani suggests Faust's studiousness. Journet apart, they do not 'act with the voice', but lines are beautifully firm and words blessedly clear.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

His speech was entitled ""Stabilize the  Situation [wen ding ju shi] and Strengthen Our Propaganda and  Ideological Work."" They have also expressed many opinions and  made many suggestions on the region's propaganda and ideological  work for this year.    During their discussions, delegates unanimously held: This  is a year of crucial importance for our country in the course of  reform and development. Development and stability are two major  tasks in the region's work. To carry out the region's various  reform tasks for this year, it is necessary to correctly handle  the relationship between reform, development, and stability. To  implement reform in an all-round way, we must have a stable  social environment and favorable public opinion.    They further pointed out: Ours is a region where minority  nationalities live in compact communities. Strengthening the  unity of various nationalities and maintaining the unification  of the motherland accord with the fundamental interests and  common aspirations of all nationalities throughout the region.  The unity of various nationalities is of fundamental importance  for the region's social and economic development. Practice has  proved that whenever our work is effectively performed among  various nationalities, our economy develops rapidly in a stable  situation. Reform and development will become empty talk without  a stable social and political environment. For this reason, we  who are engaged in propaganda and ideological work should regard  maintaining social stability as our own duty. In propaganda and  ideological work, we should always give priority to the struggle  against splittism, maintaining the unification of the  motherland, strengthening the unity of various nationalities,  and preserving social stability. We should rid ourselves of the  past practice of doing propaganda and ideological work off and  on. We should always do solid work in this regard. We should  constantly keep a clear head and should not, to the slightest  degree, slacken our efforts to publicize the importance of  stabilizing the situation [dui wen ding ju shi de xuan chuan].  In propaganda, we should keep to the central theme of our  society and carry forward our national spirit and the spirit of  the times. We should arm the party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We  should educate people in the theory and make it take root in the  hearts of the people of various nationalities across the region  so that it will become the basic guiding principles for all of  our work.    Meanwhile, we should comprehensively and accurately  publicize  the party's basic theory and line and its principles and  policies; we should publicize the creative spirit and heroic  deeds demonstrated by the masses of people in the course of  reform and construction; and we should help people emancipate  their minds, change their ideas, do pioneering work, and make  progress. We should focus our attention on doing a good job in  reform and opening up, establishing a socialist market economic  structure, and promoting the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the economy.    Delegates said: In short, propaganda and ideological work  is,  as Comrade Jiang Zemin put it, to arm our people with scientific  theories, guide them with correct publicity, inculcate them with  high ideals, and encourage them with fine works of literature  and art.    Delegates held: Propaganda and ideological work is  systematic  work. This work cannot be done by propaganda and ideological  departments alone. Party committees and governments at various  levels should further enhance their awareness of propaganda and  ideological work and mentally overcome the practice of  concentrating on economic work to the neglect of propaganda and  ideological work. We must effectively carry out propaganda and  ideological work as we do economic work. Propaganda and  ideological departments should live up to the expectations of  the party and the people by extensively carrying out propaganda  and ideological work in order to mold favorable public opinion  for our region's social stability, reform, and opening to the  outside world.

The French Basque region fishermen's union meanwhile on  Wednesday protested the ""unspeakable acts of violence"" in  Monday's incident during which 60 Spanish boats from  Fuenterrabia, across the border, attacked the 12 French trawlers  for exceeding their anchovy quota.    The French quota is 2,700 tonnes a year and the Spanish  27,000 tonnes.    The Spanish started fires on three of the French ships,  hurling petrol bombs and trying to board them after throwing  grappling irons. Spanish fishermen said nine of their boats  were damaged.    Shipping experts here said Wednesday that according to a  partial estimate of the damage to the French boats, at least two  nets costing 70,000 francs (12,000 dollars) each were destroyed.    French Fisheries Minister Jean Puech said Tuesday that the  French fishermen should respect their quotas, but added that  Spanish fishermen had no right to enforce European Union rules  in French waters.    One French boat, the Laetitia, has been held in Fuenterrabia  since being seized by the Spaniards on Monday, despite a promise  that it would be returned. An angry crowd in the Spanish port  burned its nets and destroyed its navigation equipment.     "

This was stated by  Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the information and press  department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, at a briefing today  in connection with President Boris Yeltsin's edict to carry out  measures to mark Russia's state border on its Estonian section  before the Russian-Estonian treaty on the border is concluded.    The edict by the Russian president, he noted, is aimed at  creating conditions for applying the law on the border and  defending Russia's political and economic interests. The lack  of a physical marking of Russia's state border impedes the  application of Russian legislative acts that deal with halting  and punishing violations of the border and with the unsanctioned  movement of various raw materials, including smuggling, across  it, the Foreign Ministry representative said.    The marking by the Russian side of the border, which already  exists, does not contradict either the Helsinki Final Act, or  the treaty on the fundamentals of inter-state relations between  Russia and Estonia of 1991, Karasin stressed. He also expressed  the hope that at the talks between the state delegations on  border issues the Estonian side will occupy a more constructive  position, which would open the way to concluding a treaty on the  Russian-Estonian border.

0,FT923-5304 ,"FT923-5304 _AN-CIDBKABCFT 920902   FT  02 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan acts on liquor      By LUISETTA MUDIE      TAIPEI   TAIWAN yesterday liberalised its import regime on brandy, vodka, gin and other spirits, allowing the private sector to import liquor - previously a government monopoly. The move came into force the day after Baroness Thatcher, former UK prime minister, called in Taipei on the Taiwan government to scrap remaining trade barriers. UK and French trade officials have complained to Taipei of discriminatory taxes on Scotch and Irish whiskies and French armagnac and cognac. As the private guest of Citibank and a Taiwan newspaper, Baroness Thatcher said: 'You now have an obligation to open your markets to the goods and services of others, and get rid of restrictions of all sorts.' Taiwan let private companies import whisky in April last year, when whisky sales topped Dollars 200m. Scotch and Irish whiskies are subject to a monopoly sales tax of Dollars 17 a litre; 'other whiskies', mainly US, are taxed at Dollars 8. French armagnacs and cognacs are taxed twice as much as other brandies, at Dollars 40 per litre. Officials say higher taxes are levied on EC liquor for its quality and matching price. So far, private imports of spirits have been limited to the US and EC.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

In an interview with PRENSA LATINA at the end of his  official  six-day visit to Brazil, which concluded in Rio, Lage said an  example of this isolation is the UN General Assembly's approval  of resolutions against the U.S. embargo for two consecutive  years.    He noted that the second time, more countries supported the  resolution.    The 44-year-old Cuban vice president indicated this is the  result of Cuba's refusal to renounce its socialist principals  and the admiration this position produces in the world.    Regarding Washington's lifting of the embargo against  Vietnam, Lage said this is the result of ""the heroic Vietnamese  struggle and victory,"" and makes it even more evident to  international public opinion that ""the U.S. blockade against  Cuba is unjust and cruel.""    In Brazil, the Cuban leader and the delegation accompanying  him visited Sao Paulo, Brasilia -- the capital of the country --  and Rio de Janeiro. They met with President Itamar Franco,  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso, and Health Minister Henrique Santillo.    Shortly before ending his visit, Lage said he found, in the  aforementioned officials, a great understanding and a firm  attitude against unilateral measures, like the blockade against  Cuba and the so-called Torricelli Law, which seeks to influence  third countries with the objective of attacking Cuba.    Carlos Lage, one of the Cuban Government's officials in  charge of the economy, said the objectives of his official visit  to Brazil were to contribute to the development of bilateral  political, trade, and economic relations in general, to promote  important scientific cooperation agreements in the field of  agricultural, and discuss issues of interest to Latin America.    Brazil, he underscored, is an exporter of food and  industrial  products that Cuba needs, but he clarified that he wants trade  with the South American giant to be balanced.    He indicated that the increasing amount of exports to the  Brazilian pharmaceutical market will contribute to that  stabilization. A $30 million contract for Cuban sales of those  products was signed this year.    He emphasized that Cuba owes Brazil $48 million and it is a  debt that still needs to be completely paid, but it will be  eliminated through the growth of bilateral trade.    Regarding the vaccine against type B meningoccic meningitis,  which Cuba manufactures and which Rio authorities requested to  fight an outbreak here, he indicated a Brazilian national  commission is still examining it in order to approve it being  imported.    He added Cuba can wait for those results because its health  authorities are convinced the vaccine is effective, given its  parameters comply with all international regulations and was  successfully used in Cuba during a mass immunization campaign.    In the area of general Brazilian-Cuban cooperation, he said  Brazilian firms provide specific services to companies with  concessions for petroleum-producing studies in Cuba, but he  stated there were no talks on petroleum during this visit.    In the agricultural field, he expressed Cuba's interest in  intensively studying Brazil's experience with alternating sugar  cane and soybeans crops in the same soil.    Regarding Cuba's situation, he said it is expected that in  1994, along with economic growth in tourism and the production  of domestic petroleum, there will be an upsurge in other  economic sectors that have been in decline.    This will depend, he clarified, on various factors,  including  the fluctuation of prices on the international market, and,  because of the complexity of that situation, he suggested  caution in making predictions.    Finally, regarding Cuban predictions for economic relations  with the United States if that country lifts the blockade, Lage  said that in the last few months the Clinton administration has  intensified the blockade and approved the Torricelli Law.    ""At this time, we are not yet in a condition to anticipate  that situation with the United States,"" he stressed.     "

The Arab League also called on the Security Council to  provide as soon as possible the mechanism necessary to protect  the Palestinian people against the atrocities carried out by the  Israeli occupation forces.    In a statement issued today, the Arab League General  Secretariat says that in the past it had warned of acts of  violence against the Palestinian citizens in the occupied lands.  In its statement, the Arab League says: At a time when the  world is waiting for the implementation of Security Council  Resolution 904 concerning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the  Israeli occupation authorities have carried out an 18-hour siege  of a three-story building in Hebron. The Israeli forces opened  artillery fire on Palestinian citizens, killing a number of  them, including two women, one of them pregnant.    The statement affirms that Israel has once again proved its  disregard of international resolutions and the appeals of  international society.    The Arab League said that Israel is endeavoring to torpedo  the peace process despite its claims on the issue of peace.  This might undermine the Arab public's confidence in the  on-going efforts, in view of the clear contradiction between the  call for peace and the efforts to achieve it.     "

He also approved the  main directions of the program for this study. An ITAR-TASS  correspondent was informed of this today by the press service of  the president of the Russian Federation.    According to this information, the main directions of the  research program comprises six sections, the priority one being  the development of the legal system of the Russian Federation  following the adoption of the new constitution of the Russian  Federation. It was noted that first and foremost it was  necessary to ensure that such principles of a rule-of-law state  as the state being bound by law, the supremacy of law, the  guarantee of human rights and freedoms, the division and mutual  restraint of powers are consistently executed in the  constitutional and present legislation of the Russian  Federation.    Preparation of a whole package of legislation on social and  legal protection for citizens is urgently needed now that Russia  is a social-oriented state. This is said in the section called  ""The Individual in the World Today -- State Guarantees of  Constitutional Status"" of the document on basic directions.    It stressed that confirmation of the individual, his rights  and freedoms, is a supreme value in the Russian Federation.  This, along with the recognition that the state's main  obligation is to protect the rights and freedoms of the  individual and the citizen predetermine the necessity to perfect  existing legislature and to work out and adopt new normative  acts (which are either directly envisaged by the constitution of  the Russian Federation, or are implied by them).    Further work on a federal anti-crime program is considered  extremely important along with the adoption of a new criminal  and civil procedure code, of a code on abuse of office, of laws  against organized crime and corruption - needed to protect the  individual from criminal arbitrariness. The research program  draws attention to the fact that the institute of president, of  head of state in Russia has acquired new state and legal  substance. A parliament - a Federal Assembly - has been formed.  The legal status of the Government, its place in the division  of power, has been fundamentally changed. Judicial reform is  under way, aimed at transforming the court into a genuinely  independent ""branch"" of state power. One of the priority tasks  of legal reform is to make federal state power an institution in  legislation. In this sphere, it is necessary, it says in the  political and legal research project, to work out and adopt such  acts as a Law on the Government of the Russian Federation, a  law, or general clause, on federal ministries, state committees  and other federal bodies of executive power (including  territorial), laws on the bases for setting up executive power  bodies within the components of the Russian Federation, on  federal bureaucracy, the judicial system, the Constitutional  Court of the Russian Federation, the Supreme Court of the  Russian Federation and a number of other laws.    Seeing Russia as a federative state based on the principle  of  the unity of the basic parts of the state system, on the  principle of equality between the entities of the Russian  Federation, of the supremacy of federal law, it is proposed that  we also work out and adopt a number of laws, in particular, on  the procedure for changing the constitutional status of an  entity of the Russian Federation, on forming a new entity of the  Russian Federation, and on registering a new entity in the  Russian Federation. The authors of the program believe the  Russian Federation should set out in legislation the principles  for delimiting the areas of authority and the terms for mutual  delegation (transfer) of power ""along vertical lines,"" from the  federation to entities within the federation and the other way  round.    The idea has been put forward of transforming the territory  of the former USSR into a single humanitarian area, where the  rights of the Russian-speaking population - in countries of the  ""near abroad"" - are guaranteed. Such an area would help solve  the problem of forced migration. A Eurasian Commission for  Human Rights and a Eurasian Court of Human Rights could serve as  instruments supporting such a legal structure, the authors of  the basic directions believe. They also say a Eurasian Charter  (Convention) of human rights and rights of peoples should be  prepared and adopted.    The research program also attributes importance to the  Russian state's economic role and to Russia's role in the world  community.     "

With regard to these questions the federal agencies of state  authority of the Russian Federation publish the Principles of  Legislation, in conformity with which the agencies of authority  of the republics that make up the Russian Federation carry out  their own legal regulation, including the enacting of laws and  other legal acts.    On 21 February 1992 Russian Federation Law ""Mineral  Resources"" was signed. In Article 1 of this law it is indicated  that the law is in effect on the entire territory of the Russian  Federation. The legislative and normative acts of the republics  that make up the Russian Federation must not contradict this law.    An analysis was made of seven laws on the mineral resources  of the republics that make up the Russian Federation, one code,  and two decrees: Komi SSR Law ""Mineral Resources,"" 12 February  1992; Udmurt Republic Law on Mineral Resources, 13 February  1992; North Ossetian Republic Law, ""Use of Mineral Resources in  North Ossetian SSR,"" 27 October 1992; Republic of Buryatia Law,  ""Mineral Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral  Resources,"" 28 October 1992; Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Law,  ""Mineral Resources,"" 22 December 1992; Republic of Tatarstan  Law, ""Mineral Resources,"" 18 February 1993; Republic of  Bashkortostan Code on Mineral Resources, 28 October 1992;  Mordvinian SSR Supreme Council decree, 9 April 1993, ""Procedure  for Application of RSFSR Law, Entitled `Mineral Resources,' on  the Territory of Mordvinian SSR""; and decree of the Government  of the Republic of Tuva, 28 January 1993, No. 41, ""Measures to  Regulate the Relations in Use of the Mineral Resources of the  Republic of Tuva.""    Only two laws were enacted several days prior to the signing  of the ""Mineral Resources"" Law; the others were enacted later.  Therefore they must not contradict the ""Mineral Resources"" Law.  At the same time, study has indicated that the republics that  make up the Russian Federation are not taking into consideration  the fact that the territory of the Russian Federation includes  within itself territories of subjects of the Federation and  those republics view themselves as independent sovereign states  that are not subordinate to the Federation's central authority.    Certain republics that make up the Russian Federation, in  laws on mineral resources, do not always mention the Russian  Federation's ""Mineral Resources"" Law as the basis for  promulgating their own act on mineral resources.    For example, in the Republic of Buryatia Law, ""Mineral  Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral Resources""  (Article 1), it is stipulated that the Republic of Buryatia  legislation on mineral resources is based on the corresponding  principles enunciated in the Republic of Buryatia Constitution  and the Federative Treaty, in accordance with which the mineral  resources of Buryatia are the property of the peoples living on  its territory.    In the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Law (Article 1) it is  stipulated that the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) legislation on  mineral resources is based on the corresponding principles  enunciated in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Constitution and  the Russian Federation (Russian) Constitution. Similar  formulations exist in the Republic of Bashkortostan Code on  Mineral Resources and the laws of certain other republics.    The Republic of Tuva Government has limited in time the  application of the RF Law ""Mineral Resources."" In a decree dated  28 January 1993, entitled ""Measures to Regulate the Relations in  the Use of the Mineral Resources of the Republic of Tuva,"" it is  indicated that, pending the enactment of the Republic of Tuva  Law, ""Mineral Resources,"" state regulation of the relations in  the use of mineral resources on the territory of the Republic of  Tuva is carried out on the basis of RF Law ""Mineral Resources"";  the statute governing the granting of licenses for the use of  mineral resources, which was approved by RF Supreme Soviet  decree, dated 15 July 1992, No. 3314-1; and the Statute  governing the rules and conditions for collecting payments for  the right to use the mineral resources, which was approved by RF  Government decree dated 289 October 1992, No. 828.    The Udmurt Republic, in its Law ""Mineral Resources"" (Article  4), has stated that the Russian Federation's legislation on  mineral resources is in effect on the territory of the Udmurt  Republic so far as it does not contradict the Udmurt Republic  Law on mineral resources. According to Article 7 of that law,  questions that have not been included in the competency of the  Udmurt Republic and the local soviets of people's deputies are  under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation with regard to  the regulation of mining relations.    Despite the fact that Russian Federation Law ""Mineral  Resources"" failed to mention the question of the ownership of  the mineral resources, and also failed to divide the state's  mineral resources fund into any component parts, the republics  that make up the Russian Federation have expressed their own  point of view with regard to these questions.    In Komi SSR (Article 2) the mineral resources on the  territory of Komi SSR are considered to be the republic property  of Komi SSR; and in Udmurt Republic (Article) the mineral  resources are the state property of the Udmurt Republic, and the  use of the republic's mineral resources can be carried out for  the benefit of the peoples living on its territory.    In North Ossetian SSR (Article 2), Republic of Buryatia  (Article 2), Republic of Bashkortostan (Article 2), Republic of  Sakha (Yakutia) (Article 2), and Republic of Karelia (Article  2), stipulation is made for republic mineral resources funds.    In accordance with Russian Federation Supreme Soviet decree,  dated 27 December 1991, entitled ""Delimitation of State Property  in the Russian Federation Into Federal Property, State Property  of the Republics That Make Up the Russian Federation, Krays,  Oblasts, Autonomous Oblast Autonomous Okrugs, the Cities of  Moscow and St. Petersburg, and Municipal Property,"" the  resources of the continental shelf pertain exclusively to  federal property. Despite this fact, the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia), in Law ""Mineral Resources,"" stated that the republic  fund is made up of the parts of the mineral resources that are  being used and that are not being used, as well as the  continental shelf of the territory of the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia). The disposition of the republic mineral resources  fund in the interests of the peoples in the Republic is carried  out by the Government of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).    In Russian Federation Law ""Mineral Resources"" (Article 2) it  is stipulated that the disposition of the state mineral  resources fund is carried out in the interests of the peoples  living on the corresponding territories, and all the peoples of  the Russian Federation. Meanwhile the Udmurt Republic (Article  2) and North Ossetian SSR (Article 2), the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia) (Article 2), and the Republic of Karelia (Article 2)  stipulated the disposition of the republic mineral resources  fund only for the benefit of the peoples residing on the  territory.    In a number of acts the competency of the Russian Federation  in the sphere of regulating the relations in the use of mineral  resources is not mentioned at all, or is defined in abbreviated  form. According to the Law of the North Ossetian SSR (Article  2), sectors can be allocated from the republic mineral resources  fund for the purpose of guaranteeing state security and the  protection of the environment. The borders of those sectors and  the procedure for using the mineral resources on them are  established by the enacting of joint decisions by the agencies  of authority of the Russian Federation and the North Ossetian  SSR.    This proviso does not guarantee the subject of the  jurisdiction of the federal agencies of state authority of the  Russian Federation, which already include the federal energy  systems, nuclear power engineering, splitting materials, federal  transportation, railroads, and activities in space.    All of these areas require mineral resources.    According to the Republic of Bashkortostan Code on Mineral  Resources (Article 1), individual powers with regard to  promulgating acts of legislation concerning the mineral  resources of the Republic of Bashkortostan can be transferred to  the Russian Federation in accordance with the Treaty on the  principles of international relations between the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Bashkortostan. Legislative acts  of the Russian Federation concerning mineral resources with  regard to questions transferred by the Republic of Bashkortostan  to the Russian Federation are mandatory on the territory of the  Republic of Bashkortostan, and in Article 3 of this Code it is  stated that the Republic of Bashkortostan can transfer  individual powers with regard to regulating the use of mineral  resources both to the Russian Federation, and to the republic's  rayons and cities.    Thus, the interrelations between the agencies for  administering the Republic of Bashkortostan state mineral  resources fund and the agency for administering the Russian  Federation state mineral resources fund in questions of the  functioning of the Russia-wide methodological and normative base  for the use of mineral resources and the single base for  geological information about mineral resources, as well as in  other questions of use of mineral resources, are defined by  bilateral agreements between them.    According to Komi SSR Law ""Mineral Resources"" (Article 5,  paragraph 2), the interests of the Russian Federation in the  area of the efficient placement and use of the mineral  fuel-and-energy base are reinforced by treaty and other  agreements with the Russian Federation. The Republic of Karelia,  in its Law ""Mineral Resources,"" states in detail the competency  of the Russian Federation in the sphere of regulating the use of  mineral resources.    In our opinion, it would be desirable to prepare, instead of  the Russian Federation Law ""Mineral Resources,"" Principles of  the Russian Federation Legislation on Mineral Resources, to  define the owner of the mineral resources, to give a more  clear-cut formulation of the concept of the mineral resources  fund, and, to the extent possible, to reduce the competency of  the Russian Federation in the sphere of the relations for  regulating the use of mineral resources. Then there will be the  possibility of enacting laws on the mineral resources of the  republics that make up the Russian Federation in a new wording.    The Komi SSR Law ""Mineral Resources"" provides a definition  of  the concept of mineral resources. It is the surface of the land  and the space under it, excluding the agricultural stratum, with  rocks, minerals, and containers. This definition omits the  bottom of bodies of water, which is not the surface of the  earth, and also the lower limit of the mineral resources to  depths that are accessible for geological study and assimilation.    The Udmurt Republic also provides a definition of the  concept  of mineral resources. According to Article 1 of Law ""Mineral  Resources,"" the mineral resources of Udmurt Republic include  that part of the natural environment within the confines of the  republic's territory that lies below the soil stratum and the  bottom of bodies of water to depths that are accessible for  assimilation. This definition omits depths that are accessible  for study.    The Republic of Udmurtia provides a definition of the fund,  calling it not a mineral resources fund, but the Udmurt Republic  state mining fund. According to Article 1 of its law, the  mineral formations contained in the mineral resources, as well  as other objects there that represent interest for study and  industrial assimilation, constitute the state mining fund of the  Udmurt Republic.    It is not completely clear what is meant by objects  representing interest for study and industrial assimilation. One  wonders whether these objects include a subway or an underground  airfield.    According to Republic of Tatarstan Law ""Mineral Resources""  (Article 1), the mineral resources of the Republic of Tatarstan  constitute that part of its natural environment that is situated  under the soil and vegetation stratum, and under the bottom of  lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, with the minerals contained in  them, from their outcroppings to the daylight surface to depths  that are accessible for geological study and assimilation. In  our opinion, the definition of the concept of mineral resources  is most precise in the Republic of Tatarstan law.    The same Tatarstan law contains Article 3, concerning mining  relations. According to that article: 1) relations arising  during the possession, disposition, and use of the mineral  resources constitute mining relations; 2) the owner of the  mineral resources, and the user of the mineral resources, are  the subjects of mining relations; 3) the agencies of state  authority and state administration of the Republic of Tatarstan,  as well as the local administration, cannot be the user of the  mineral resources; 4) the sector of the mineral resources  (mining claim) that was granted to the user in the procedure  established by this law is the object of the mining relations;  5) the license and the mining-claim document which are issued in  conformity with this law are acts that result in the arising of  mining relations; 6) the license is a document that certifies  the right to use the mineral resources within the confines of  granted sector within a period of time established by the  license, with the observance of the terms stipulated by it; 7)  the mining-claim document is a document that grants the user of  the mineral resources the right to carry out his activities  within the confines of the mining claim in conformity with the  purposes indicated in the license; 8) state administration of  the use of mineral resources is carried out by the Government of  Tatarstan or through agencies empowered for that purpose.    The overwhelming content of the article is nonnormative. It  consists of definitions of concepts (of mining relations; of  subjects and objects of mining relations;of acts that result in  mining relations; of the license; and of the mining-claim  document). In several laws this is usually stated at the  beginning of the law, under the title ""Terms Used in the Law.""    As for the substantive content of the article, in our view  the concept of mining relations does not encompass the  protection of the mineral resources. This is an independent  element of mining relations, and it must be pointed out.    Something that is not completely precise is the absolute ban  preventing agencies of the state authority and state  administration of the Republic of Tatarstan, as well as the  local administration, from using the mineral resources. It would  scarcely be desirable to deprive them even of the right to carry  out the mining of generally widespread minerals, which right is  granted to owners of sectors of land in accordance with Article  5 of the law.    An article that is of definite interest is Article 4 of  Republic of Tatarstan Law ""Mineral Resources,"" which is devoted  to objects of the right of ownership. According to this article,  the property of the Republic of Tatarstan includes: 1) the  mineral resources and the deposits of minerals that are located  in them; 2) deposits situated on the territory of Tatarstan and  contiguous territories in that part in which they are located in  the Republic of Tatarstan; 3) deposits of minerals and sectors  of mineral resources that were acquired by the republic within  the confines of other territorial-administrative and  national-state formations of the CIS and abroad; 4) information  concerning the geological structure and mineral and  raw-materials potential of the mineral resources that is  received at the expense of funds from the state budget; 5)  tailings of removed, surrounding, and side-recovery rocks, and  storage facilities for other waste products, which form  technologically exploitable resources of mineral raw materials  that accumulate during the extraction, dressing, and processing  of natural minerals.    From the text of the article on objects of the right of  ownership it is evident that the republic is attempting to  define as precisely as possible the limits of everything  valuable that is its property. Unfortunately, it has not  revealed in the law the methods by which the republic acquires  deposits of minerals within the confines of other  territorial-administrative and national-state formations of the  CIS and abroad.    In the preamble to the Republic of Buryatia Law ""Mineral  Resources and the Principles of Use of Mineral Resources,"" there  is a statute concerning the use of mineral resources in the  drainage area of Lake Baykal, which is regulated by conditions  governing special use of the natural environment, which are  aimed at the unconditional preservation of Lake Baykal as  national property of the Russian Federation.    The section of the law that is devoted to the efficient use  and protection of the mineral resources contains Article 32,  ""Special Rules For Use of the Mineral Resources in the Drainage  Area of Lake Baykal."" According to this article, the use of the  mineral resources in the water-protection zone of Lake Baykal is  allowed only with the application and observance of  technological schemes that preclude any runoffs or emissions  that are capable of harming Lake Baykal or its ecosystem. The  use of the mineral resources in the shore zone of Lake Baykal,  with the exception of the study of the mineral resources without  the carrying out of mining operations, the extraction of  generally widespread minerals, and the construction of  underground and water-intake structures with a depth of up to 10  meters for their own needs by the owners and leasers of sectors  of land, is prohibited.    In Article 19 of the Bashkortostan Code on Mineral Resources  it is emphasized that users of the mineral resources to whom  they are granted for purposes that are not linked with the  abstraction of minerals, in the event that minerals are detected  or appear on the sector that has been allocated to those users,  must immediately report that fact to the agency that issued the  license.

""The lady was  screaming and yelling that there were children in there, but you couldn't  breathe, and you couldn't see, and you couldn't touch anything. . . . Even the  firemen, when they came out, started crying after seeing those babies.""    Fire officials, who found no smoke detectors in the rubble, believe that the  blaze may have been caused by a faulty television set.    The dead infants were identified as Jessica Jordan, who would have been 8  months old today, and 13-month-old John H. Reilly IV, according to fire  officials and relatives of the children.    Jessica's mother, Susan Jordan, burst into tears after fire officials at the  scene reported the death.    ""Oh my God,"" she screamed as crisis intervention workers escorted her to a van.    John H. Reilly III, father of the 13-month-old, stared in disbelief at the  charred home at 5122 Audrey Drive when he arrived there Thursday evening.    ""He was our only child,"" said Reilly, his eyes filling with tears. ""I can't  believe it happened. How can something like this happen so quickly""?    Of the other two children at the home, Devon Strayer, 3, of Huntington Beach  was treated at Humana Hospital and released, while Nick Duncan, 6 months,  remained hospitalized at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange with second- and  third-degree burns, said Martha Werth, a public information officer for the  Huntington Beach Fire Department.    The day-care provider, Pat Orozco, 49, was hospitalized in fair condition with  smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on her arms and shoulders. Also  hospitalized for smoke inhalation were Huntington Beach Firefighter Chris  Gruber and Bill Applebee, a Huntington Beach Water Department employee who  tried to rescue the children from the burning house.    Tom Huntley, an investigator with the Huntington Beach Fire Department's Fire  Prevention Bureau, said firefighters found no evidence of smoke alarms in the  house, although there may have been a fire extinguisher in the kitchen.    Under state day-care licensing requirements, providers who baby-sit up to six  children have the option of equipping their homes with either smoke detectors  or fire extinguishers, said Dianne M. Edwards, director of adult and employment  services for the Orange County Social Services Agency.    However, the state Building Code requires family day-care providers to have  both fire extinguishers and smoke detectors, said Steve Viero, supervisor of  field operations for the state fire marshal. Viero could not explain why the  two codes differ or whose responsibility it is to enforce the smoke detector  requirement.    In an interview from her bed at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, Orozco said she  was coming out of the kitchen and entering the living room when she turned  around and saw the fire. Orozco said she grabbed two children and took them  outside but was unable to get back into the house to retrieve the other two.    ""The flames were overwhelming,"" she said.    Asked if she knew how the fire started or where the flames came from, Orozco  just weakly shook her head.    ""It's all kind of blank right now,"" she said. ""I did my best.""    Volunteer therapists coordinated by the American Red Cross spent about 15  minutes with Susan and Donald Jordan, Jessica's parents, before the couple  emerged from a white van to look at the Orozco house.    ""Sometimes they just need to be held and have a shoulder to cry on,"" said Linda  M. Johnson, a licensed family therapist from Huntington Beach who helped  console the distraught mother. ""Once the shock ends, then the grief begins.  This is the beginning for them, not the end.""

Reilly III, father of the 13-month-old, stared in disbelief at the  charred home at 5122 Audrey Drive when he arrived there Thursday evening.    ""He was our only child,"" said Reilly, his eyes filling with tears. ""I can't  believe it happened. How can something like this happen so quickly""?    Of the other two children at the home, Devon Strayer, 3, of Huntington Beach  was treated at Humana Hospital and released, while Nick Duncan, 6 months,  remained hospitalized at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange with second- and  third-degree burns, said Martha Werth, a public information officer for the  Huntington Beach Fire Department.    The day-care provider, Pat Orozco, 49, was hospitalized in fair condition with  smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on her arms and shoulders. Also  hospitalized for smoke inhalation were Huntington Beach Firefighter Chris  Gruber and Bill Applebee, a Huntington Beach Water Department employee who  tried to rescue the children from the burning house.    Tom Huntley, an investigator with the Huntington Beach Fire Department's Fire  Prevention Bureau, said firefighters found no evidence of smoke alarms in the  house, although there may have been a fire extinguisher in the kitchen.    Under state day-care licensing requirements, providers who baby-sit up to six  children have the option of equipping their homes with either smoke detectors  or fire extinguishers, said Dianne M. Edwards, director of adult and employment  services for the Orange County Social Services Agency.    However, the state Building Code requires family day-care providers to have  both fire extinguishers and smoke detectors, said Steve Viero, supervisor of  field operations for the state fire marshal. Viero could not explain why the  two codes differ or whose responsibility it is to enforce the smoke detector  requirement.    In an interview from her bed at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, Orozco said she  was coming out of the kitchen and entering the living room when she turned  around and saw the fire. Orozco said she grabbed two children and took them  outside but was unable to get back into the house to retrieve the other two.    ""The flames were overwhelming,"" she said.    Asked if she knew how the fire started or where the flames came from, Orozco  just weakly shook her head.    ""It's all kind of blank right now,"" she said. ""I did my best.""    Volunteer therapists coordinated by the American Red Cross spent about 15  minutes with Susan and Donald Jordan, Jessica's parents, before the couple  emerged from a white van to look at the Orozco house.    ""Sometimes they just need to be held and have a shoulder to cry on,"" said Linda  M. Johnson, a licensed family therapist from Huntington Beach who helped  console the distraught mother. ""Once the shock ends, then the grief begins.  This is the beginning for them, not the end.""    Times staff writers Richard Beene, Marcida Dodson, George Frank and Carla  Rivera contributed to this report.

Mr Lopez moved to Volkswagen of Germany in March as head of production and purchasing. At a press conference after GM's annual meeting in Oklahoma City yesterday, Mr Louis Hughes, executive vice-president for international operations, said the company had 'executed a legal complaint' against Mr Lopez 'for what we believe is the taking of confidential documents'. The complaint was in the hands of German prosecutors, who would decide whether to pursue the charges, Mr Hughes added. In Bonn last night, VW declined to comment. An official said there would be no statement until Monday at the earliest. Shortly after Mr Lopez's surprise departure, he hired six GM employees - three purchasing executives and three buyers - who had worked under him. GM has alleged that Mr Lopez also approached up to 40 more in an effort to lure them to VW. The US group has already filed a legal action in Germany to stop alleged headhunting of staff by Mr Lopez. Mr Lopez's departure from GM was seen as a blow to its efforts to cut car manufacturing costs in North America, where the company has lost Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.70bn) over the past two years.

The leftist National Democratic Front and the rightist  Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Revolutionary Nationalist  Alliance] have rejected the amnesty proclamations signed by  President Ramos last Friday. They said any such plan should be  the result of peace talks between the government and the rebels.    But Press Secretary Jesus Sison said the amnesty  proclamations were necessary because ""we have to have peace,""  adding that the president has issued them ""in good faith.""    Leaders of the Moro National Liberation Front and other  Muslim rebels have yet to issue their position on the amnesty  program.    Speaker Jose de Venecia yesterday acknowledged that some  rebel leaders were likely to reject the president's amnesty  offer but that their followers were ready to apply.    De Venecia also said there would be another amnesty  proclamation after the conclusion of the peace talks between the  government and the various rebel groups.    At least 25,000 rebels are expected to apply for amnesty, he  said, adding that the Ramos proclamations are sure to pass the  House of Representatives.    ""The realpolitik of the amnesty is that there is a  wide-scale  acceptance from the lower and middle echelons because they are  the ones fighting the war, they are the ones dying, famished,  and unable to see their families,"" he told a news conference.    ""The other leaders who are more adversarial to the amnesty  can wait until the completion of the peace talks, but they  should not prevent their comrades from availing themselves of  the amnesty now,"" he added.    Sison said Mr. Ramos, in issuing Proclamations 347 and 348,  ""reached out to unify the divided forces of the nation.""    ""The next step is up to the rebels to take advantage of them  amnesty proclamations,"" he said.    Proclamation 347 grants amnesty to all persons who in  pursuit  of political beliefs may have committed crimes punishable either  by the Revised Penal Code or special laws.    It applies to all rebels, but it requires them to apply  first.    Proclamation 348 grants amnesty to military and police  personnel who may have committed acts punishable under the  Revised Penal Code, the Articles of War or special laws.    Leftist groups rejected the amnesty program, saying it did  not result from peace talks.    Renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio ""Gringo"" Honasan said amnesty was  not the answer to the problems that gave rise to military  rebellion.    Rightist rebels are more interested in pursuing their call  for electoral reforms, reforms in the military, social justice  programs, and good government, ""not amnesty,"" he said.    Mr. Ramos, in issuing the two proclamations, said ""the time  for talking is over"" and ""the time to decide and act has come.""    ""These grants of amnesty are only part of the actions  contemplated by the government in its unrelenting quest for a  just and enduring peace for our country and people,"" he said.    ""This does not preclude and is without prejudice to any  legal  arrangement that may result from a negotiated settlement which  the government is still pursuing with the various rebel groups  which I am hopeful will materialize soon,"" Mr. Ramos added.    But rebel leaders and other sectors cited several  objectionable features of the two proclamations.    -- The amnesty program is placed ahead of social reforms  ""which should be the government's primary concern.""    -- It does not guarantee that the rebels will be granted  amnesty because their application can be opposed by anyone. It  is at best a long, tedious process.    -- It does not cover common crimes which most of the  political prisoners are charged with or convicted of.    -- The amnesty plan for soldiers and police allows human  rights violators among them to be freed from liability as long  as their offenses were committed in the course of the  anti-insurgency campaign .    Under both proclamations, an amnesty extinguishes any  criminal liability for acts committed by the grantee. But it  does not free him from any civil liability or damages inflicted  on a victim.    The amnesty also does not cover crimes such as torture,  arson, massacre, rape, and robbery.    Rebels may apply with the newly formed National Amnesty  Commission within six months after Congress concurs.    The Senate and the House of Representatives are on a  two-week  Lenten recess since last Thursday. Congress resumes sessions on  11 April.    De Venecia dismissed speculations that the proclamations  might face rejection in Congress.    ""Amnesty is a popular issue, why should we reject a program  wanted by tens of thousands of people who are asking for peace?""  he said.     "

0,FT942-11614 ,"FT942-11614 _AN-EEED1ABKFT 940505   FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Brussels acts on cement dumping      By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI      WARSAW   Mounting Portland cement sales from Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the European Union have led Brussels to open anti-dumping proceedings against the three countries. The move comes at the instigation of the German producers' association, whose share of the German market fell to 80 per cent in 1992 from 86 per cent in 1991. The association is charging that exports from Poland, for example, are almost 40 per cent cheaper than locally-produced cement. The complaint comes despite the strong German position in Poland's cement industry. German cement companies have recently purchased many Polish state-owned plants and last year accounted for almost 40 per cent of Polish cement output. The anti-dumping action comes in spite of Polish promises to maintain 'fair' export prices. German producers and Poland's cement producers' association have an agreement the Poles will price cement exports at German levels. Polish producers have to obtain export licences from the country's foreign trade ministry. If the exporter offers to sell cement abroad at prices lower than those agreed with German producers the ministry may refuse to issue a licence. Last year Poland produced 12m tonnes of cement, of which 2.4m tonnes were sold abroad, mostly to Germany. This contrasts with the 19m tonnes produced by the industry at its peak in 1979 and 12m tonnes in 1992, when exports amounted to 1.6m tonnes.   Countries:-  BEZ  Belgium, EC.

Under the treaty, Iranian tourists were permitted to visit Japan without a visa. However, an increasing number of Iranians have been entering Japan as tourists and staying in the country illegally to work. Demand for foreign labour in Japan is high in the service and construction industries. The foreign ministry said that Iranians entering Japan had nearly trebled from 1989 to 1991, with 44,376 Iranians entering the country in the first 11 months of the year. At the same time, Japanese immigration officials were refusing entry to an increasing number of Iranians who arrived in the country. This came to 6,631 in the first 11 months of 1991, compared to 1,571 in all of 1990. In December, Iran refused entry to Japanese in Tehran in retaliation for Japan's deportation of illegal Iranian workers. The visa-exemption treaty is a relic of Japan's attempts to promote close relations with the oil exporting nations of the Middle East. The Foreign Ministry said yesterday, however, that the agreement to suspend the treaty would not affect other aspects of the bilateral relationship.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

This was announced to Interfax by the  committee's Chief Viktor Ilyukhin (the Communist Party's  faction).    In his opinion, it was necessary to utilize the provisions  of  the former law on Constitutional Court, which did not contradict  the new Constitution adopted at the referendum on December 12,  before a new law on Constitutional Court was adopted.    He reminded that the Russian Federation's constituent  members  were energetically issuing new laws and acts which at times  failed to conform with the Russian Constitution. Ilyukhin also  qualified several decrees of the Russian president as  ""non-constitutional."" According to Ilyukhin, the president  exceeded his powers when signing the decree on elimination of  the Security Ministry and on establishment of the Federal  Service of Counter-Intelligence subordinated to the Russian  president.    According to the deputy, the new Russian Constitution does  not mention the right of the president to resubordinate the  ministries. Ilyukhin considers this move aimed at establishing a  second government parallel with the cabinet of Chernomyrdin.    Ilyukhin is concerned over the fact that Yeltsin may not be  satisfied with resubordination of intelligence and  counter-intelligence and that he ""harbors the idea to  resubordinate the Interior Ministry and the army."" According to  Ilyukhin, this is to say that these bodies will be beyond  judicial and prosecutor's control and also beyond the  parliament's control"" leaving them uncontrollable as during the  Stalin era.

The priority in naturalization should be granted to those  non-citizens who have finished educational establishments with  Latvian teaching language rather than to the spouses of  citizens, as stipulated by the present bills, said Abikis.    Non-citizens should take another state language exam before  getting citizenship because the present language commissions  often issue undeserved language certificates, he said.    In addition, state language inspectors in Riga have faced  violence on several occasions, said Abikis. An inspector in the  Latgale district, for example, was severely beaten recently.    Abikis claims that the brutal acts are directed against the  Latvian state and evidence of reluctance of part of non-Latvians  to respect the Latvian nation and its language.    The State Language Center has applied to the Justice  Ministry  in a bid to receive salary additions from collected fines for  breaking of the state language law. State inspectors presently  receive 59 lats per month.    The language learning among adults proceeds with  difficulties  but the younger generation gives grounds to hope for the better,  said Abikis. In the largest cities, especially in Daugavpils  and Kraslava, many non-Latvian children learn in  Latvian-language schools.    The Latvia's Way faction believes that professional training  in Latvia should fully transfer to the Latvian teaching  language, said Abikis.     "

But his cruise aboard a Greek shipowner's yacht, together with his wife, Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, and five children, is stirring controversy by resembling a royal progress more than a family excursion. The left-wing opposition expressed outrage that the government allowed the former king to come home. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Socialist leader, demanded his immediate expulsion. One newspaper editorial wondered why his two eldest sons, both in their 20s, were not arrested on arrival and taken off to start military service, still compulsory in Greece. A judge in Thessaloniki last week ordered an investigation to determine whether the ex-king had committed any treasonable acts while on Greek soil, such as inciting citizens to riot. Even the government panicked when the ex-royal family disembarked in northern Greece and set off to visit soldiers manning a border post on the frontier with Macedonia. Their jeep had to turn back after finding the road blocked by embarrassed local police officers. The minority of Greeks who admit to being monarchists have no trouble keeping up with the ex-king's activities. His trip is being exhaustively covered by a private Greek TV channel, owned by another shipowner.   Countries:-  GRZ  Greece, EC.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.   Types:-  PEOP  People.

Hundreds of Palestinian citizens were murdered or  wounded in this act.    In a statement to the JORDAN NEWS AGENCY, Prime Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali described what happened at the Ibrahimi  Mosque as an unprecedented crime, and as an indication of  fanaticism, extremism, and lack of respect for human rights and  sanctities.    Dr. al-Majali said that this criminal act constitutes a huge  obstacle on the road to achieving a just and comprehensive  peace, which Jordan has been tirelessly seeking to achieve. He  stressed the need for a full Israeli withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories and for the removal of settlements as  a guarantee to prevent the recurrence of such criminal acts that  are in conflict with all humanitarian and religious values.    Dr. al-Majali said: At this time, when our region is  witnessing immense events, we are in a dire need for a unity of  stands and ranks on the Arab and Islamic levels in order to be  able to confront challenges.    In his own name and on behalf of the Jordanian Government,  Dr. al-Majali extended condolences to the Palestinian leadership  and to our people in the occupied territories.

Mostly malt is fermented and turned into beer or whiskey. However, malt sugars  are easy to digest, and 19th Century doctors often prescribed malt for children  and invalids. There were problems with it, though. In liquid form it tended to  ferment, and for years every attempt to produce a stable dried form of malt  failed.    The man who succeeded in making malt powder was William Horlick, an Englishman  who emigrated to Chicago in the 1870s. His process consisted of drying malt  extract with wheat extract in a vacuum. He called the resulting product  Horlick's Food, patented it and set up a business in Racine, Wis. (where he  also married a woman who must have been a cousin -- her maiden name was  Arabella Horlick).    Doctors blessed his name and prescribed their patients Horlick's Food, which  made a tasty drink when mixed with milk. However, in the late 19th Century,  cow's milk was often unwholesome. Before modern refrigeration and  pasteurization (which did not become universal until the '40s), milk was  commonly infected with diseases, such as the dreaded tuberculosis. The 19th  Century expression ""the summer sickness"" referred to diseases spread by milk.    Horlick was unhappy about this, so he conceived the idea of making a form of  Horlick's Food that wouldn't have to be mixed with milk. In 1882 he perfected  the process of drying milk right along with the wheat and malt, making a  product that only needed to be mixed with water.    It was a convenience food as well as a health food. Travelers carried it to the  tropics, the Himalayas and the Poles. Horlick's Malted Milk Tablets were  renowned as a cheap, reliable food during the Depression, when they were a  standard item in school and work lunch pails. Even as late as the '50s, members  of the Depression generation often made sure to keep malted milk tablets in the  pantry for emergencies.    All of these attractions would have made Horlick's business a success, but as  it happened, there was another factor at that particular time as well. In the  late 19th Century, the Temperance Movement was constantly trying to wean men  away from saloons. One bright idea along these lines was the milk bar, also  known as the ice cream parlor or soda fountain, where only ice cream and  nonalcoholic beverages were served.    Malted milk was a natural for the soda fountain. It was not only nonalcoholic  but regarded as healthful. American taste turned a health food into a pleasure  food, as it would later do with peanut butter and granola.    With tens of thousands of ice cream parlors making him a wealthy man, Horlick  became a public benefactor. He donated a school, a hospital and a park to the  city of Racine. He supported wholesome youth movements like the Boy Scouts.    And probably out of a sense of gratitude to the Scandinavians of Wisconsin, he  donated to many Norwegian causes.

FOREIGN MEDIA NOTES: ALGERIA    ALGERIAN ABSTRACTS #5: REPORTING ON ARMED ISLAMIC GROUP    Slain GIA Members Identified  On 28 February EL WATAN reported that ten members of the Armed  Islamic Group (GIA) including their leader Si Ahmed Mourad,  known as El-Afghani, (alias ""Seif Ellah"" [Sayf Allah] according  to LIBERTE of 1 March) had been shot down by police forces in  Bouzareah. According to EL WATAN, other GIA members killed were  Rachid Djabri, Beraf ta Aissa, Daas and Lounici; the other five  members killed have not yet been identified. However, LIBERTE of  28 February reported that the death of Aissa was not yet  confirmed.    EL WATAN reported the following biographical information on  slain GIA members: Si Ahmed Mourad, a 29-year old Afghani  veteran living in Kouba had been condemned to death in abstentia  by the Algier's Special court. Mourad is reportedly the author  of several assassinations and behind numerous horrible crimes  attributed to the GIA. He was also responsible for the  kidnapping of the officers from the French Consulate last  October which resulted in the death of five GIA members and the  escape of El-Afghani, Beraf ta Aissa, Rachid Djabri and Guezmir  Mohamed. Mohamed was later killed by police.    Berafta Aissa and Rachid Djabri were thirty-five and  twenty-nine years old respectively, both residents of Algiers.  An arrest warrant had been issued for his participation in  committing several murders and various crimes in the region.  Daas had reportedly been head of the GIA in the Bouzareah  region. He too was wanted for several murders in the  neighborhood.    Reaction to Slaying of GIA Members    According to EL WATAN of 28 February the slaying of GIA  members on 27 February in not only ""a brilliant success for the  forces of order but also a severe blow to the organization and  structure of the terrorist groups."" The slaying of El-Afghani  and his followers, considered ""the bloodiest and the most  radical of the fundamentalist armed groups within the terrorist  movement"" is viewed as a ""decisive turning point"" in a three  year struggle against ""terrorism."" While historically, according  to EL WATAN, a new leader generally emerges, the loss for this  group is believed to be so significant that it is ""reasonable to  think that a considerable slakening and a reduction from these  blows is expected."" The article recognizes that a murderous  reaction on the part of those remaining in the group cannot be  downplayed.    Given El-Afghani's refusal to support any dialogue between  the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and the government, this wing  of the GIA was considered a ""serious barrier to dialogue."" Now,  however, according to EL WATAN, ""if the disappearance of  El-Afghani and his followers does significantly paralyze the  actions of the group, his dissappearance should logically open  channels for dialogue."" Given the GIA's threats, under the  leadership of El-Afghani, to kill all Islamists who engaged in  any kind of negotiations with the Government, EL WATAN asserts  that his death was probably a priority and a prerequisite for  any negotiations between the FIS and the government    LIBERTE of 28 February interpreted the operation as an  indication of Algerian President Liamine Zeroual's determination  to combat violence. ""The successful attack demonstrated that the  authorities not only had the intention of not giving respit to  the armed groups, but in a pinch had the means to attack  `terrorism.'""    According to LIBERTE, the first consequence of this incident  for Zeroual is that it will ""weigh heavily on government- FIS  negotiations,"" given El-Afghani's resistence to dialogue. But,  on the other hand, LIBERTE predicts that the government will  clearly enforce its position, pointing out that the government  can now ""flaunt"" its steadfastness to eradicate violence and  perhaps will no longer tolerate dialogue while Algerians engage  in violence. Finally, according to LIBERTE, the incident could  mean that the government is simply in the process of ""getting  back on its feet.""    New GIA Leadership; Organizational Structure    Sayah Attia, according the French language weekly LE FIGARO  of 9 March, has become the new chief of the GIA, replacing  Mourad Si Ahmed. According to EL WATAN of 1 March, Attia's  group is one of three groups operating under the name of Armed  Islamic Group (GIA) outside of Algiers. Attia is reportedly  operating in Medea, Ksar El Boukhari and Tissemsilt. He is  reportedly a ""bloodthirsty"" individual, with a preference for  hand-to-hand fighting. Son of an Harki, he has reportedly lead  a ""commando"" of armed criminals. The commando is credited with  having committed more than 200 terrorist acts described as the  most murderous and savage. He is identified by security  services as the principal instigator in the assassination of  twelve Croats last December, killing approximately ten members  of an official cortege. According to security services he is  also responsible for an attack on the military barricks in  Boughezoul in 1993.    ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 8 March reported that in 1989 Attia  returned to Afghanistan through Saudi channels, where he  remained for three years. He re-entered Algeria clandestinely  in November 1992. The father of six children, plus a  fourteen-year-old daughter of his second wife, Attia is  reportedly responsible for 132 assassinations and 283 acts of  aggression and vandalism.    Khaled Sehili heads the second group, which operates in  Blida, El-Affroun, Chrea and Boufarik. Sehili is reportedly  responsible for the slaying of at least 50 police officers and  nearly 150 acts of sabotage. He is also reportedly responsible  for an ambush which killed about 12 military personnel last  September in Chrea.    Kada Benchiha heads the third group, which operates in Sidi  Bel-Abbes. Benchiha is also son of an Harki.

""They do not accept that there have by any  attacks (on shipping) by units belonging to the government,""  Thimio Mitropoulos of the UN's International Maritime  Organization (IMO) told reporters Thursday. He said the  officials he met in Beijing early this week insisted that if  commercial shipping had been intercepted by Chinese security  forces, it was only in the normal course of law enforcement,  including anti-smuggling efforts.    Mitropoulos is in East Asia on a fact-finding mission ahead  of a meeting of the IMO's marine safety committee, which he  chairs, to discuss an upsurge of piracy in the South China Sea.  During his stay in Hong Kong, the British administration gave  him a list of nearly 100 reported attacks on shipping, many of  them apparently committed by renegade Chinese naval and police  units.    In Beijing, the official PEOPLE'S DAILY newspaper said China  was drawing up strict guidelines for its maritime security  forces to curb what it called the ""chaotic state of some  anti-smuggling units."" But Mitropoulos said his hosts in China  -- including the foreign and public security ministries -- never  told him that new rules were in the pipeline.    Mitropoulos was proceeding to Manila on Thursday to continue  his research before heading back to IMO headquarters in London.     "

Comment    : Some commenters objected to the proposed regulation that would limit a false certification discharge to only those cases where a student admitted to a school on the basis of a purported ability to benefit from the school's training did not meet the applicable requirements for admission on the basis of ability to benefit. The commenters believed that the HEA did not envision any restriction as to what would constitute a school's false certification of a student's eligibility to borrow under the FFEL Program. Other commenters believed that some restrictions should apply, and proposed additional acts and certifications of a school that should be construed as false certifications. Some commenters were pleased with the regulations as written, and recommended no changes.         Discussion    : The additional acts and certifications by a school that the commenters proposed were the same as those discussed in the NPRM published on January 14, 1994 (FR 59, No. 10). For the reasons stated on pages 24882490 of the NPRM, and for the additional reasons discussed earlier in response to comment 5, the Secretary believes that the term ``falsely certified,'' when used for purposes of a false certification discharge, applies to cases involving a school's invalid certification that a student had the ability to benefit from the training offered by the school, or cases where the school signed a person's name on the loan application or the promissory note, and certain cases where the school wrongfully endorsed a person's name on the loan check, or the borrower's authorization for electronically transferring loan proceeds.     The Secretary believes that if the school rather than the student signed a person's name on the loan application or the promissory note, the putative borrower is not aware that a loan was being applied for and had no intention of entering into an agreement to repay a loan. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a borrower who did not sign the application or promissory note could not have completely understood that a check later presented for endorsement would represent the proceeds of such a loan, and would not have intended to signify by endorsing such a check or authorization to release funds that he or she agreed to become obligated to repay a loan. A school that signed a person's name on a precursory document (the loan application or the promissory note) effectively prevented the person from being fully aware of the relationship normally apparent to a borrower who first completes an application for a loan and later receives a loan disbursement as a result of that application.     The Secretary understands that in some cases, an unscrupulous school may obtain the valid signature of a borrower on the loan application or promissory note and will later sign the student's name on the loan check or the authorization for electronic funds transfer. However, despite these actions, a student could have materially benefitted from the loan proceeds by a reduction of the charges owed to the school or by otherwise receiving proceeds of the loan delivered by the school. The Secretary believes that a person who signed the loan application and promissory note should be considered an individual who was aware that he or she requested a loan. Therefore, if the borrower (or student on whose behalf a parent borrowed a PLUS Loan) was enrolled at the school during the period of time that the loan (or an installment thereof) was intended to cover, and someone other than the borrower signed the borrower's name on a loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, causing the loan proceeds to be applied to the student's account to satisfy a liability for tuition and other charges owed to the school, or to be delivered to the borrower, it is reasonable to conclude that the borrower by that action received the proceeds of the loan he or she had applied. Because that borrower obtained the benefits of the loan disbursement, even though the borrower realized that he or she did not sign the loan check or the authorization for electronic funds transfer, that borrower would be legally obligated with respect to that disbursement. In this case, the Secretary does not believe that a loan discharge was contemplated by Congress. However, if it is determined that the borrower or student did not benefit from the loan proceeds, the Secretary believes that the borrower should be relieved of any obligation to repay the amount of the loan proceeds transmitted as a result of a falsely signed loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, and that such relief can be included in the procedures adopted for discharges under section 437(c) of the HEA.

0,FT931-8793 ,"FT931-8793 _AN-DBQC0AF4FT 930217   FT  17 FEB 93 / A cause without Delors: Europe must launch a 'crusade for democracy'      By EDWARD MORTIMER   There was one memorable phrase in Mr Jacques Delors' speech to the European Parliament last week. Unfortunately, it was embedded in a passage of classic Euro-speak. After proclaiming that 'democracy, subsidiarity and transparency were the European Commission's watchwords', Mr Delors went on to say: 'With an eye to the next institutional reform, scheduled for January 1996, I feel obliged to point out that, had the 1991 intergovernmental conference accepted the Commission's idea of a hierarchy of norms, the subsidiarity principle could have been applied more rationally.' If that sentence is transparent, my name's Norman Tebbit. But in the next sentence came the memorable phrase. The Commission, said Mr Delors, 'intends to conduct this crusade for democracy'. Although the word 'crusade' was perhaps ill-chosen, given the unfavourable connotations it has for Europe's Moslem inhabitants, something like a 'crusade for democracy' is desperately needed. Yet the Commission is ill-placed, and Mr Delors himself ill-qualified, to lead such a crusade. I do not question his democratic convictions, but his language, his public image and his past career are essentially those of a technocrat. He rose to political office in France via the civil service and a series of 'technical adviser' roles. Not coincidentally, this was also the preferred role of the EC's founding father, Jean Monnet. Throughout its history the EC has been a brilliant conspiracy of Europe's governing elites. Each step forward in its history has been the work of an intergovernmental conference (IGC), at which national governments negotiated a treaty. Each successive treaty has amended or enlarged the preceding one. The result is a text of ever-growing complexity, largely incomprehensible to ordinary people. That in itself should not matter. Most acts of national parliaments are no easier for the layman to follow without expert guidance. But we accept them as the work of people we have elected to legislate for us, and who do at least debate the acts in public. In IGCs, by contrast, the work is done at best by ministers, more often by officials, following the conventions of diplomatic negotiation, not parliamentary debate. They meet behind closed doors. Yet the texts emanating from these bodies are much more important than most acts of national parliaments; indeed, they define ground rules within which national parliaments are obliged to operate ever after, unless they take the extreme step of withdrawing from the EC altogether. These texts do, of course, require national ratification. But the fact that national ratification of the latest one - the Maastricht treaty - is proving so difficult shows that the limit of public tolerance has now been reached. It is pure self-delusion to imagine that things would be better if only the last IGC had accepted 'a hierarchy of norms'. From here on a different approach is needed. Mr Delors mentioned 'the next institutional reform, scheduled for January 1996'. Actually the Maastricht treaty (article N2) says nothing about January. But it does say that 'a conference of representatives of the governments of the member states shall be convened in 1996 to examine those provisions of this treaty for which revision is provided'. In other words, yet another IGC. Revision of the Maastricht treaty will certainly be needed, in 1996 if not before, because whole chunks of it will be unworkable even with 12 member states, let alone the 16 the Community will probably have by 1996. What is actually required is a constitution: that is, a rule book for the European union - something all Europeans could understand, and to which they could appeal when any of the union's governing bodies appeared to exceed its lawful powers. Many states, including most of the EC's member states, have such a document to regulate their internal affairs. How did they get it? By electing a special assembly, called a constituent assembly, to draft it for them, and in most cases by ratifying the result in a referendum. So that's what we need in 1996, not another IGC but a European constituent assembly, empowered to revise the treaty and present the results to member states for ratification. One way to get it would be to agree in advance that the next European Parliament will have such powers - but that may not be possible, because it would mean getting agreement before the next European elections, which are little more than a year away. Either way, we shall not get such an assembly without the agreement of national governments, since only the member states could endow it with the necessary powers. This means we shall not get it unless there is a widespread and intensive public campaign for it throughout Europe, one so big that national governments dare not ignore it. A crusade, if you insist. National governments will fight hard and dirty to avoid this surrender of power, equating - as always - their own power with national sovereignty, and depicting the proposed assembly as a federalist monster. But the answer to that is simple. The decisions of the assembly would not be binding on any member state until it had ratified them. I suggest this should be done by holding a national referendum in every member state on the same day; but if some states insist on using a parliamentary procedure, so be it. The important point is that democracy and transparency would have been part of the process from the start, instead of being dragged in as a half-hearted afterthought, which is what has happened with Maastricht. There is no time to lose. The crusade should start now.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.

The Red Army and several Islamic guerrilla groups met  several  weeks ago at the Teheran headquarters of the Iranian  intelligence service, the Arab-language AN-NAHAR said quoting  intelligence organs in several European countries.    The dispatch from Paris said Iran is hoping to disrupt the  Middle East peace talks because it fears isolation should they  be successful.    Tehran also appears to believe that one aim of the talks  between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  is to destabilize Iran, according to the paper.    The Islamic groups attending the meeting included Hizbollah,  a Lebanon-based militant Shiite faction, and the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, an extremist  group operating outside the PLO, the report said.    The meeting was also attended by high-ranking officials from  the Iranian intelligence service and Iran's revolution guard  corps, the report said.    The paper said Iran's revolution guard corps has trained the  Japanese Red Army in Bekaa Valley in Lebanon and the Iranian  Embassy in Beirut has helped Red Army members travel between  Iran and Lebanon.    The Red Army, formed in 1971, was responsible for a series  of  hijacking and armed attacks in the 1970s, including the 1972  massacre at Lod International Airport in Tel Aviv.     "

It is quite natural that Greenpeace members conducted  anti-nuke activities in South Korea together with the local  people.    If the Kim Yong-sam group continue to dump nuclear waste in  the sea and wreck ecological environment while accelerating the  development of nuclear weapons, ignoring the unanimous protest  of the people at home and abroad, it will face a stern judgement  by the whole nation and the world people.

During the same period, similar crimes were  perpetrated on the Agadez-Arlit road.

The law, passed by parliament in February and taking effect after a three-month grace period, is intended to end piracy which costs the state treasury millions of dollars a year, and bring Polish laws in line with international norms. Polish artists welcomed the new law but said its efficacy would largely depend on how well it was enforced. The new legislation replaces a weak and outdated 1952 copyright law under which the police's ability to make arrests was limited. A part of the law governing computer piracy went into effect immediately after it was passed in February. The weakness of the old law helped music, video and computer piracy flourish after communist rule ended in 1989, flooding the streets with hawkers of cheap cassettes. It was also a discouragement for some foreign investors. The IFPI estimated that the state treasury lost a minimum of Dollars 25m in 1991 and probably much more in 1992 to music pirates alone and official producers lost three times as much. Computer software is dominated by pirated programmes. Those losses should be quickly reduced, experts say, and prices of official recordings are not expected to rise much as a result of the new law.   Countries:-  PLZ  Poland, East Europe.

The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, was responding to a request from the Association of Pension Lawyers for guidance for employers. Although employers who offer traditional final-salary and money-purchase schemes have been given clearance to inform employees about scheme benefits, the picture is more vague for those who set up schemes for groups to have personal pensions with a specific life company. SIB concluded that employers who set up a group personal pension scheme need not seek authorisation to carry out investment business because they have no commercial motive in mind. If the employer receives some commission from a life insurer for doing so, however, or receives a reduction of the premium on a general insurance contract, the company may need to be authorised by the relevant self-regulating authority. While SIB would not consider literature explaining that a group personal pension scheme had been set up to be advertising, any other literature likely to encourage individuals to take up the offer could well be. Such literature should be prepared only by an independent financial adviser or the product provider.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

A ""unilateral declaration of ceasefire"" signed by  rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe and  issued in this northern Tanzanian town blamed the massacres of  tens of thousands of Rwandans on the ""presidential guard, armed  civilians and militias.""    It called for a ""cessation of hostilities"" to get food and  medicine to tens or possibly hundreds of thousands of displaced  people and ""bring this conflict to a peaceful settlement.""    The death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious  April 6 plane crash triggered an ethnic bloodbath and rekindled  the three-year civil war.    The rebel declaration said the ceasefire would be  conditional  on the government forces ""controlling all killings and acts of  violence in areas under their control within 96 hours of the  coming into force of this declaration."" Another condition was  that the government forces accept an international inquiry into  the killings and allow those found responsible to be punished.    It also made the end of fighting dependent on the government  forces agreeing to joint security patrols with the rebels to  stop atrocities.    It also said the government must agree to joint control of  the airport and safe corridors for humanitarian aid.     "

0,FT944-18003 ,"FT944-18003 _AN-EJED5AGFFT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Espy resignation leaves farm interests adrift - American farmers feel they are losing a valuable friend at court      By LAURIE MORSE   Michael Espy's resignation as US Agriculture Secretary on Monday took many US farmers by surprise, and left farm interests adrift just as they faced their toughest battle ever to preserve their entitlement programmes before a congress less and less interested in rural issues. A minor light in Washington, the soft spoken, articulate Mr Espy had taken on heroic proportions in farm country, where his rapid response to agricultural disasters, and his pro-farm positions on trade issues won him wide popularity. The secretary said he would quit the Clinton cabinet at the end of the year to 'clear his good name' in the face a widening array of allegations that he accepted favours from the agribusinesses he was charged with regulating. Until the announcement most farm interests brushed off the Washington talk of ethics violations as inconsequential. 'He was a congressman, he never really switched gears to operate like a secretary, but he is doing an excellent job,' a Midwestern grain dealer stated last week. In fact, Mr Espy's accomplishments during 18 months in office are substantial. During last summer's disastrous floods, when more than 23m acres in the Midwest were damaged, he not only expedited payment of more than Dollars 2bn in farm disaster claims, but repeatedly visited catastrophe areas to assure producers that government aid was on its way. He also weathered strong criticism of the US Department of Agriculture after tainted meat caused deaths in the US pacific north-west last year. He turned the incident into a crusade, making food safety a major objective of the agency. This past summer, faced with the worst forest fire season in US history, he was again quick to support the US forest service, which comes under the USDA's purview. He also won Bill Clinton allies in farm states by backing trade sanctions against Canadian wheat imports even as he campaigned for agriculture, small and large, to support of the administration's major trade initiatives, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Gatt. In Washington, Mr Espy was forging the first overhaul of the USDA since its creation by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. His push to close 1,200 of the agency's 14,000 field offices, and to cut the Washington bureaucracy made him enemies in his own office, but will trim nearly Dollars 169m from the federal budget if carried through. Most importantly for farmers, the former Mississippi congressman was knowledgeable about the workings of the Farm Bill, a massive piece of legislation that governs every aspect of US Agriculture and often dictates profit parameters for producers of scores of commodities. In place for five years, the Farm Bill is the embodiment of pork barrel and politics. Current US agricultural legislation is to expire next year and farm groups and the USDA are already hard at work establishing the issues to be addressed in the 1995 Farm Bill. Farm interests are now concerned that any one brought on in Mr Espy's place must immediately face the challenge of getting the Farm Bill through congress. Declining farm populations leave farm states with fewer representatives in congress just as budget contraints are making urban politicians resentful of massive US farm payments. The USDA estimates that today, 370,000 farms earn 85 per cent of US farm income and most farm programme payments go to large farms with relatively large household incomes. It is no wonder that farm groups feel they need an effective friend at the helm of the USDA.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

TISHRIN says: When Israel goes too far in its insistence  on separate deals, it proves that it does not want peace.  Neither does it want the region to enjoy stability and  tranquility. Israel's proposals of separate deals and  settlements have become an indivisible part of its true  objective of evading a just and comprehensive peace. It is  simply a part of its maneuverings and deception to circumvent  the Madrid conference's bases and its objective and true formula.    TISHRIN adds: The escalation of confrontations in the  occupied Arab territories is a natural result of the Israeli  policy based on peddling separate deals. Its weapons in this is  the Oslo agreement. After signing this agreement on 13 September  1993, Israel was able to drag the Palestinian side into making  further concessions and into relinquishing Palestinian rights.  Israel used this agreement as a pretext to continue its  terroristic and oppressive measures, and to perpetrate massacres  against the sons of our people in the occupied Arab territories.    TISHRIN holds Israel responsible for the escalation of acts  of violence in the occupied Arab territories. It says: This  violence began in a form of terrorism, oppression, repression,  and killing at the hands of the Israelis and their brutal and  fascist practices against the Palestinian people. These  practices have become even more rancorous since the signing of  the Oslo agreement. They continued in a form of sporadic  massacres, the biggest of which were the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre and the Jabaliya massacre.    TISHRIN adds: All developments indicate that the occupation  troops, the settlers, and the Israeli terrorist organizations  threaten to perpetrate new massacres in other places in the  occupied Arab territories similar to the Hebron massacre.    TISHRIN notes that by all standards, Israel's terrorism is  the source of tension and disturbances in the occupied  territories and the region. Had Israel been really and truly  serious about the stability of the situation, it would have  responded to the requirements of the just and comprehensive  peace, first and foremost showing readiness to withdraw from the  occupied Arab territories, recognizing the Madrid formula, and  implementing it in letter and spirit, especially since it is  based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the  principle of land for peace.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: The comprehensiveness of the  solution, a return to the Madrid bases, the end of the Israeli  occupation, and the renounciation of separate deals will  contribute to achieving a true and just peace.    In an article under the headline ""Peace and Occupation  Cannot  Go Together,"" the newspaper AL-THAWRAH also writes on the  situation in the occupied Arab territories. It stresses that  the Israeli occupation troops exploited the comprehensive  military cordon around the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to  launch an arrest campaign that has affected some 500  Palestinians on the pretext that they do not have Israeli work  permits.    AL-THAWRAH says: It is no secret to anyone that the clamor  the Israelis have been creating since the resistance operation  in 'Afula, including the imposition of a comprehensive military  cordon around the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, is  fabricated and aimed at diverting interest from the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which was perpetrated by the Zionist  settlers through support from the Israeli occupation forces.  This clamor has also come in the wake of the crime Israel has  committed by blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church near  Beirut, and later the crime which was perpetrated by the  occupation soldiers themselves at the Jabaliya camp a week ago.    AL-THAWRAH says: The Israelis will be making another grave  mistake if they think or imagine--after all that has happened  and is happening with acts of resistance and confrontations  carried out by the Arabs against the Israeli occupation forces  and settlers in the occupied Arab territories--that they can go  ahead with the peace process in the Middle East and push it  toward its specified objective of establishing a just and  comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the  Palestine question while they insist on the continued presence  of the occupation troops and settlers in the occupied Arab  territories.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: The international community,  particularly the Middle East peace cosponsors, especially the  United States, which assumes the responsibility of a full  partner and an honest broker in the bilateral talks, must tell  Israel loudly and clearly that the just and comprehensive  solution to the region's crisis for which the Arabs,  particularly Syria, are calling for, must guarantee the  withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces, the departure of  the Zionist settlers from all the occupied Arab territories, and  the restoration of the Palestinian people's natural rights.  Only this solution can bring security and stability to the  entire region.     "

By BRUCE FEIN and EDWIN MEESE III, Bruce Fein is a constitutional lawyer in  Washington. Former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III is a distinguised fellow of the  Heritage Institution.      Nelson Mandela deserves ageless respect for his 27 years of imprisonment on  behalf of the anti-apartheid cause in South Africa. It is appropriate that this  charismatic and widely acclaimed leader be welcomed and applauded as he tours  the United States.    Yet Americans should have good reason to be concerned about Mandela's political  judgment, the potential nature of his leadership and the advice that he is  offering during his visit. Heroism does not confer infallibility. Nor should  suffering for a noble cause obscure the wrongness of positions that are  diametrically opposed to basic values held by the people of our country.    Mandela and his Marxist-oriented African National Congress have repeatedly  supported and engaged in terrorism. Both before and since Mandela's release  from prison, his organization has compiled a brutal record of violence against  both black and white civilians in South Africa.    Further, Mandela openly embraces notorious oppressors of human rights:  Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, Libyan dictator Moammar  Kadafi and Cuban despot Fidel Castro. The reason for such embrace, Mandela  tries to explain, is the long-standing support of the three for the ANC and its  efforts to displace South Africa's ruling white regime.    But that explanation is unsatisfactory. Expediency and the understandable need  for support does not justify unholy alliance with those responsible for wanton  murder and widespread violations of human rights.    Mandela's gratuitous relationships with such enemies of peace and freedom  naturally arouse fears among South Africa's whites, coloreds, Indians and  minority black tribes. Such alliances raise questions about whether Mandela's  professed desire for political justice is genuine and cause suspicions that  make peaceful constitutional compromise with South Africa's racial and tribal  minorities more difficult.    Mandela's infatuation with ""one-person, one-vote"" sloganeering and his lack of  accommodation for minority concerns is also antagonistic to the cause of  political liberty in South Africa. Unchecked majoritarianism is a formula for  tyranny over minorities. As James Madison explained: ""In a society under the  forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker,  anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker  individual is not secured against the violence of the former.""    The founders of our Constitution went to great lengths to hold majoritarianism  in check and to protect the rights of minorities. Hungary's newly revamped  constitution offers special protections for Slovaks, Croats, Germans,  Romanians, Serbs, Gypsies and Jews. Mandela's seeming indifference to similar  protections against oppressive majority rule under new electoral conditions in  South Africa suggests either unschooled political beliefs or nefarious  political designs.    Mandela's economic philosophy and his commitment to Marxist ideology also raise  concerns. His sympathy for nationalizing South Africa's banks, mines and other  industries in order to transfer wealth from the white minority to the black  majority defies historical philosophical justification. Mandela cannot point to  a single nationalization program in the entire African continent, including  Egypt's Suez Canal and Kadafi's oil expropriations, that has set the framework  for long-term prosperity. Indeed, such confiscation has typically yielded  economic calamity, as illustrated by Mozambique.    Nations throughout Eastern Europe and South America are privatizing their  economies en mass to escape the disastrous results of government control. Why  is Mandela holding out against the lessons and tide of economic history? Is it  because he wishes to reward ANC loyalists with lucrative positions in  government corporations at the expense of the commonweal? Is it because he  wishes to silence dissent to the ANC by making millions dependent on an ANC  paymaster?    To raise questions of Mandela's political acumen and intent is not to detract  from his courage and accomplishments in assailing apartheid. It is rather to  alert the United States and the world community that heroic freedom fighters  are often ill-equipped for the tasks of political statesmanship when the  fighting ceases.    John Brown displayed comparable courage and passion in fighting slavery in  Kansas and at Harpers Ferry, yet was utterly unsuited for a role requiring  political vision and magnanimity, a task that was ultimately accomplished by  Abraham Lincoln.

A group of imprisoned reporters has decided to begin a  protest hunger strike at the Campo Grande Lima prison, demanding  that courts speed up the trials in which they are involved, a  spokesman said.    The CPP official also denounced the case of journalist Juan  Tuanama, a reporter for the weekly magazine JUNGLE of Tingo  Maria, who remains in jail despite a judge's order to release  him after being acquitted. Tuanama is accused of participating  in various terrorist acts during the time he was in prison, the  source said.    Other arrested journalists are charged with the crime of  ""advocating terrorism"" because they worked at the newspapers EL  DIARIO and CAMBIO, the newspapers of the Shining Path Maoist  gang and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA),  respectively.    ""They worked on those publications when the newspapers were  legal leftist outlets and had nothing to do with the subversive  groups who took over the newspapers afterward,"" the CPP  spokesman said.    The official also reported that the Supreme Court annulled a  lower court decision releasing journalists Alicia Figueroa and  Gisela Gutarra and ordered that they be arrested again.    Imprisoned journalist Monica Palomo, who is five months  pregnant, has been urgently sent to a Lima hospital due to a  placenta detachment that is threatening to cause the abortion of  her baby.

In a 5-2 decision, the justices ruled that while the district could be held  liable for direct negligence in hiring or supervising a teacher, it was not  responsible for acts that were a clear departure from his official duties.    The employee's personal actions were not related closely enough to his  authority as a teacher to warrant holding the district legally responsible, the  court concluded.    ""To impose, in effect, strict liability in this context would be far too likely  to deter districts from encouraging, or even authorizing, extracurricular  and/or one-on-one contacts between teachers and students,"" retired Justice John  A. Arguelles, participating by special assignment, said in the court's lead  opinion.    The threat of such liability would also inspire rigorous controls on activities  that would ""negatively affect"" the educational process, and it would make  already scarce insurance even more difficult for financially pressed schools to  obtain, Arguelles said.    The ruling was a victory for school administrators and districts throughout the  state that had supported the Oakland Unified School District in seeking  reversal of an appellate court decision upholding a suit by the parents of a  boy identified only as John R.    Attorneys for the parents had argued that the district should be liable for  damages when an employee improperly uses his job-created authority against his  victim.    The district countered that such liability would be financially ""devastating""  on schools. The Assn. of California School Administrators, backing the  district, added that it was illogical and unfair to punish the district while  allowing the allegedly guilty party to escape economic loss.    A separate civil suit by the parents against the teacher is pending, but  criminal charges brought earlier against the instructor have been dismissed,  according to lawyers in the case.    Margaret E. O'Donnell of San Francisco, attorney for the school administrators'  association, said the ruling brought ""good tidings"" for California schools.    ""We have always agreed that if there is negligence, such as failing to properly  screen employees, there should be liability,"" O'Donnell said. ""But a broad  ruling on indirect liability as well would not be good public policy.""    The case arose in 1981 when John R., then a ninth-grader at a junior high  school in Oakland, was asked by his mathematics teacher to take part in the  school's ""work-experience"" program, in which students help instructors grade  papers.    According to the parents, the teacher intimidated the boy into committing  sexual acts with him, threatening to give the youth failing grades if he did  not comply. The boy later told his parents about the incidents. The parents  notified district officials, who informed police.    The parents subsequently brought suit against the district, charging that it  was directly liable for its negligence in failing to supervise the teacher and  ""vicariously"" or indirectly liable for the teacher's actions against their son.    The high court's ruling on the issue of indirect liability came in a lead  opinion by Arguelles, joined by Justice Allen E. Broussard, and a separate  concurring opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson, joined by Chief Justice  Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice Edward A. Panelli. Justices Stanley Mosk and  Marcus M. Kaufman issued separate dissents.    Arguelles noted that employers were not liable when an employee ""substantially  departs"" from his duties ""for purely personal reasons"" but acknowledged that  there were instances where liability had been upheld. In one ruling by a state  Court of Appeal, Orange County was found indirectly liable for a deputy  sheriff's threats to rape a woman motorist.    But the justices rejected the contention that the authority given a teacher  over a student was tantamount to the power of police over the community. ""The  authority of a police officer over a motorist -- bolstered most immediately by  his uniform, badge and firearm, and only slightly less so by the prospect of  criminal sanctions for disobedience -- plainly surpasses that of a teacher over  a student,"" Arguelles wrote.    In dissent, Kaufman, while agreeing it was a ""rare case"" in which indirect  liability would be warranted, said ""this is such a case."" Under the  circumstances, he said, ""it is unjust not to require that the district share in  the liability for the injuries which resulted.""    The district sanctioned the work-experience program in the teacher's home and  did not require that other students or adults be present, he noted.    ""In effect, the district-sanctioned program virtually guaranteed that the  teacher could act with impunity, free from fear of interruption or discovery,  fully assured of complete privacy and secrecy,"" Kaufman wrote. ""Under these  circumstances, it is not so unusual or startling that a teacher might seize the  opportunity created by the program to make improper sexual advances toward one  of his students.""

Claims cognizable under Article 139, UCMJ, are limited to_  (a) Claims for property willfully damaged. Willful damage is damage which is inflicted intentionally, knowingly, and purposefully without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from damage caused inadvertently or thoughtlessly through simple or gross negligence. Damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by riotous, violent, or disorderly acts, or by acts of depredation, or through conduct showing reckless or wanton disregard of the property rights of others may be considered willful damage.  (b) Claims for property wrongfully taken. A wrongful taking is any unauthorized taking or withholding of property, not involving the breach of a fiduciary or contractual relationship, with the intent to temporarily or permanently deprive the owner or person lawfully in possession of the property. Damage, loss, or destruction of property through larceny, forgery, embezzlement fraud, misappropriation, or similar offense may be considered wrongful taking.      536.141      Claims not cognizable.

(d) Claims resulting from the conduct of Reserve component personnel who are not subject to the UCMJ at the time of the offense.  (e) Subrogated claims, including claims by insurers.      536.142      Limitations on assessments.      (a) Time Limitations. To be considered, a claim must be submitted within 90 days of the incident out of which the claim arose, unless the special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA) acting on the claim determines that good cause has been shown for the delay.  (b) Limitations on amount. If the General Court-Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA), or designee, acting on the claim determines that an assessment against a soldier in excess of $10,000 for a single incident is meritorious, he or she will assess the pay of that soldier in the amount of $10,000 and forward the claim to the Commander, USARCS with his or her recommendation as to the additional amount that should be assessed.  (1) A SPCMCA has authority to approve a pay assessment not to exceed $5,000 on a single incident and deny a claim in any amount.  (2) A GCMCA, or designee, has authority to approve a pay assessment in an amount not to exceed $10,000 on a single incident.  (3) Only the Commander, USARCS, or designee, has authority to approve a pay assessment in an amount greater than $10,000 on a single incident.  (c) Direct damages. Assessments are limited to direct damages for the loss or damage to property. Indirect, remote, or consequential damages may not be considered under this subpart.      536.143      Procedure.      Area claims offices and claims processing offices with approval authority are responsible for publicizing the Article 139 program and maintaining a log for Article 139 claims presented in their areas (see DA Pam 27162, paragraph 106). Area claims offices and claims processing offices with approval authority are required to monitor action taken on Article 139 claims and ensure that time requirements are met. If assessment action on a particular claim will be unduly delayed, the office may consider the claim under 31 U.S.C. 3721 and subpart K of this part if it is otherwise cognizable under that authority. The office will counsel the claimant to repay any overpayment if the Article 139 claim is later successful (see 516.163(d)(1).  (a) Form if a claim and presentment. A claim must be presented by the claimant or his or her authorized agent orally or in writing. The claim must be reduced to writing, signed, and for a definite sum in U.S. dollars within 10 days after oral presentment. (See 536.20(d)(1)(i))  (b) Action upon receipt of a claim. Any officer receiving a claim will forward it within 2 working days to the SPCMCA over the soldier or soldiers against whom the claim is made. If the claim is made against soldiers under the jurisdiction of more than one such convening authority who are under the same general court-martial convening authority, the claim will be forwarded to that general court-martial convening authority, who will designate one SPCMCA to investigate and act on the claim as to all soldiers involved. If the claim is made against soldiers under the jurisdiction of more than one SPCMCA at different locations and not under the same general court-martial convening authority, the claim will be forwarded to the SPCMCA whose headquarters is closest to the situs of the incident, who will investigate and act on the claim as to all soldiers involved. If a claim is made against a member of one of the other Military Services, the claim will be forwarded to the commander of the nearest MACOM of that Service.       "

I have invited you to this meeting, President Berisha  addressed Vollers, as a representative of the EU troika. We  will send the same report to the Foreign Ministry of Belgium  with the request that you inform the governments of the EU  member countries as follows:    Albania has the necessary documentation to prove that the  Greek terrorist unit came from Greece and that after the crime  -- the massacre in the recruits' barracks in Peshkepi e Siperme  in the early hours of 10 April, which resulted in the killing of  33-year-old Captain Fatmir Shehu, born in Tepelene, and  20-year-old soldier Arsen Gjini, born in Seman, as well as the  wounding of several other soldiers, three of whom are in serious  condition -- turned back toward Greece in the direction of the  Argjirohor border post.    The Greek military uniforms that the criminals were wearing,  the professionalism of the crime, and the objects that were  found, which are all part of the special units' equipment, speak  in favor of the argument that the Greek unit belongs to Greece's  special units and is subject to special treatment.    In its note dated 10 April addressed to the Greek Government  -- in which the Greek Government is held responsible, since the  terrorist unit came from Greece -- the Albanian Government asked  the Greek Government to find and convict the culprits, as it may  not be directly responsible for the event.    However, from the press statements of the Greek Government,  we have not only heard about its regret over the event, but we  have learned that this responsibility of the Greek Government  was interpreted as a contradiction of the Albanian note by the  Athens government.    As in the cases of the Greek warship firing on an Albanian  motorboat in our territorial waters in Sarande Bay on 4 January  1994, the violation by the Greek minesweeper of our waters near  the Qefal Cape on 10 March, the entrance on 12 March of two  armed Greek soldiers in Vidohov, who threatened the Albanian  citizens, or the murder of 20-year-old Alfred Muco by a Greek  patrol on 21 March, Greece has followed the path of denying the  facts and washing its hands of it by giving no official response.    As revenge against the departure of the person appointed by  Athens as a consul general in Gjirokaster, who was not only  exerting indecent behavior that was incompatible with that of a  diplomat but was also carrying out the duties of a consul  without having the documentation [ekzakuature] accorded by the  receiving country, which is in flagrant violation of Article 12  of the Vienna Convention, Greece did not expel our consul in  Athens but rather the first secretary of our embassy in Athens.    Under these conditions, Albania does not intend to seek  revenge by expelling Greek diplomats from Tirana. However,  based on Article 11 of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic  relations, which states that due to the lack of a clear  agreement on the mission's staff, the receiving state can  request that this staff be kept at a limit it considers  reasonable by considering the circumstances and conditions that  exist in this state and the needs of the mission in question,  Albania therefore asks the Greek Government to take all measures  so that within 10 days, it will have the same number of  diplomats in Albania as Albania has in Athens -- that is, six  diplomats. This number could also be defined on the basis of a  bilateral agreement.    Albania requests the EU Council of Ministers to ask Greece  to  provide an official response to this event. Albania is for  dialogue, but it will not accept the meetings offered without  having an official response by the Greek Government on this  Greek terrorist act. Albania asks the EU Council of Ministers  to set up a commission to verify all the aforementioned  terrorist acts and expresses its readiness for full cooperation  with this commission.    We add that we have no objection to trust this duty to the  existing commission of the EU monitors who are supervising our  northeast border, but as the commission chairman for this  six-month period is a Greek official, according to a known  principle of the right, he cannot represent a party in the  judgment.    We also ask the EU Council of Ministers to demand from  Greece  to put an end to these acts condemned by the UN Charter and  which fully violate the Maastricht principles, which Greece has  committed to keep and develop. We want to assure it that  Albania is determined to cooperate with the European Union and  the member countries, the regional countries, and Greece, as  well as all the other countries who are interested in decreasing  tension and contributing to peace and stability in the region.

Several crates of spirits were seized on Monday from warehouses and retail outlets in Lisbon after William Grant  Sons had been granted an injunction against the Portuguese company Scorbebe which had been distributing on behalf of Glen Cardine Bonded Warehouse. The move follows similar legal action taken in May in a Scottish court against Glen Cardine and two associated companies, A. Bullock and Company (international) and William Morton. A spokesman for William Grant  Sons said it had gone ahead with the latest litigation because the other companies had refused to stop producing and selling products under the Grant's name, and were threatening to expand their market penetration in Southern Europe. Aire-based Glen Catrine is one of the three leading Scottish low-strength whisky producers. It was recently embroiled in a public controversy claiming that an EC directive discriminated unfairly against low-strength whisky. The company has a bottling plant and bonded warehouse at Catrine, a distillery in Loch Lomond, and a warehouse division in Glasgow.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

At a meeting of the Protestant Academy  in Bad Boll, Bubis said on Sunday [20 February]: ""Throwing fire  bombs into asylum-seekers' hostels is just as terrible as  assassinating Hanns-Martin Schleyer."" He does not understand  why the state does not act against violent rightist  organizations just as it acted against the terrorist Red Army  Faction (RAF) in the past, which killed the president of the  employers' association.    In Bubis' view, the problem of rightist violence has been  played down in Germany far too long. Despite a dangerous  interconnection of the right-wing extremist scene, politicians  still speak of individual perpetrators and people who are just  running along. Addressing approximately 1,000 conference  participants, Bubis came out against special laws and a  tightening of the penal code: ""The existing instruments are  absolutely sufficient."" However, the judiciary must not orient  itself primarily ""at the lower limit"" in meting punishment for  rightist acts of violence.    Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Minister Frieder Birzele (Social  Democratic Party of Germany) also criticized the many cases of  incomprehensibly mild punishment. Birzele thinks the danger to  society posed by right-wing extremists is far greater than the  threat that has emanated from leftist groups. With 400-500  right-wing extremists who are ready for violence in  Baden-Wuerttemberg alone, the circle of potential perpetrators  is far larger than it ever was in the case of the RAF.     "

The Red Army and several Islamic guerrilla groups met  several  weeks ago at the Tehran headquarters of the Iranian intelligence  service, the Arab-language AN-NAHAR said, quoting intelligence  organs in several European countries.    The dispatch from Paris said Iran is hoping to disrupt the  Middle East peace talks because it fears isolation should they  be successful.    Tehran also appears to believe that one aim of the talks  between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  is to destabilize Iran, according to the paper.    The Islamic groups attending the meeting included Hizballah,  a Lebanon-based militant Shi'ite faction, and the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, an extremist  group operating outside the PLO, the report said.    The meeting was also attended by high-ranking officials from  the Iranian intelligence service and Iran's Revolutionary Guard  Corps, the report said.    The paper said Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps has trained  the Japanese Red Army in al-Biqa' Valley in Lebanon and the  Iranian Embassy in Beirut has helped Red Army members travel  between Iran and Lebanon.    The Red Army, formed in 1971, was responsible for a series  of  hijacking and armed attacks in the 1970s, including the 1972  massacre at Lod International Airport in Tel Aviv.     "

Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' responded to  reporters' questions at a joint news conference held at the end  of this meeting.    Asked for his assessment of the results of the tripartite  meeting and whether the three countries share common stands,  al-Shar' said: The Kurdish leaders, through our contacts with  them, have asserted that they do not seek to divide Iraq, but  they do want their situation to be taken into consideration.  They want a united, democratic Iraq in which the Iraqi people  decide Iraq's future. In fact, this is also Syria's position.  The foreign minister said that the Iraqi regime should comply  with the UN Security Council resolutions and cooperate with the  United Nations.    Answering a question on Syria's stand regarding the acts of  terrorism against Turkey and on the difference between such acts  and Palestinian resistance of Israeli occupation, al-Shar' said:  Syria does not support any kind of terrorism. Turkish  officials know full well that Syria does not render any support  to the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] and that Syria is very  concerned about the unity, safety, and security of friendly  Turkey. Al-Shar' added: Since we are talking about our concern  for Iraq's security and territorial integrity, it is obvious  that we stand against any element that threatens the security  and territorial integrity of any of our three countries. He  said: There are many allegations that Syria supports terrorism,  whether with regard to the PKK or other terrorist acts. I can  explain why such accusations are leveled against Syria. Such  accusations are leveled against Syria because it differentiates  between the terrorist act, which it considers a crime against  law and justice and which must be denounced, and the struggle of  people under the yoke of foreign occupation. In light of this,  the intifadah in the occupied Arab territory cannot be  considered terrorism. Also, Lebanese resistance in southern  Lebanon against the Israeli military occupation cannot be  considered terrorism. Such a Syrian stand is in harmony with the  international law and the UN Charter and resolutions.  Regrettably, some newspapers do not differentiate between these  two things. They mislead and distort public opinion either  intentionally or unintentionally. It is time to stop such  deceptive media campaigns in Turkey in particular and in the  West in general.    Asked whether Syria is concerned about the amount of water  Turkey allows to flow into Syria, Faruq al-Shar' said: Yes, we  are concerned about this issue, because it is a vital issue.  What really concerns us is not the quantity of water flowing  into Syria and Iraq, but the failure to reach a firm agreement  on water-sharing between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Al-Shar'  added: It is true that the Turkish Government abides by a  protocol that was signed in 1987. An agreement was reached  during Demirel's visit to Damascus at the beginning of last  year, to the effect that the foreign ministers of both countries  will reach a final agreement on water-sharing before the end of  1993. This, however, did not happen.    Al-Shar' asserted that the sharing of international river  waters is very important to any country facing such a problem.  What Syria wants is a very legitimate demand which is in  harmony with international laws and norms. Furthermore, this  helps achieve stability and cooperation in the region.  Meanwhile, the failure to reach an agreement will remain a  cause of continuous tension. He said that Syria does not demand  private privileges, but demands what is granted by international  law and norms regarding the distribution of water among Turkey,  Syria, and Iraq. Al-Shar' noted that he held talks on this  issue with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Turkish  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and described these talks as  serious. He added that this issue will be followed up so as to  reach an agreement on water sharing in accordance with the  international law and norms.    Answering another question on Syria's differentiation  between  resistance against occupation and terrorism, al-Shar' said:  There is a difference between what is taking place in Palestine  and southern Turkey. He added: Turkey is an independent  sovereign state. We are committed to Turkey's unity,  independence, and security. We do not support any action that  would undermine Turkey's future and territorial integrity. The  Turkish people are the ones who decide their country's future.    Al-Shar' added: The Palestine question is completely  different. The Palestinian people were not only exposed to  coercion at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces, but  their lands and rights were also usurped. Furthermore, settlers  came from outside the region to replace them. Therefore, there  is a big difference between the two issues. The United Nations  is fully aware of this and it issued resolutions demanding  Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Arab territory. These  resolutions constitute the basis of the ongoing peace talks in  Washington, which we hope will achieve the expected objectives.     "

This Islamic awakening is growing and  surging, thanks to our Lord and His care, despite the attempts  of the enemies of Islam, here and abroad, to harm and wipe it  out.    Even after their war against Russia and the collapse of  communism, the enemies in the West consider Islam and the  Muslims the enemies that must be fought with all efforts. They  have kept NATO and are currently trying to bolster it and  increase its members.    Several regimes in our Arab and Islamic countries responded  to this tendency by world enemies. Those regimes persecuted and  subdued the Islamic trend and tortured and intimidated its  members in a bid to terrorize this trend and prevent the public  from cooperating with it.    But the Islamic nations, which adhere to their religion,  have  discovered that the sincere Islamic trend is rallying those who  are most devoted to their homelands. It has been proven that  the Islamic nations are making sacrifices, shouldering burdens,  and enduring afflictions without entertaining any covetous  designs. But they are doing so for the sake of God and their  countries. At the same time, the Islamic nations are seeing how  some of those in power are benefit-seekers and how they are  plundering public funds and receiving bribes from big-time  thieves.    We read about these grotesque crimes in the press every day.  But all these crimes are forgotten with the passage of time and  the criminals never stood trial or were punished, to avoid  scandal. Those who reveal the crimes are tried and condemned,  while the real criminal is acquitted.    At a time when the widely popular Islamic trend is harassed  and prevented from performing its public function on the grounds  that its activities are illegal, we see that some parties that  are not popular among the people are allowed to perform  activities through papers and magazines. Those parties even  receive funds and are presented as the representatives of the  people.    All this is taking place on the basis of a wrong premise.  Some ruling regimes resort to this premise to create a balance  between the existing powers. Those regimes try to harass the  strong Islamic trend to allow antifreedom forces to perform  activities in a bid to minimize the people's cooperation with  this strong Islamic trend. But no matter how the defeated  secular forces and remnants of communism try, they would not be  able to influence this religious Muslim people.    Perhaps it is useful for the younger generations to know  some  historical facts about the past: In 1964, Russian Prime Minister  Khrushchev came to Egypt to inaugurate the second phase of the  High Dam. He insisted that all communist prisoners be released  before he arrived in Egypt. He also said that the communists  should be allowed to work in the entire Egyptian media service.  This is what indeed happened. The communists, who were with us  in the same al- Wahat prison, took control of the media and  exploited the whole service to spread their ideas and cast  doubts in Islam.    When al-Sadat assumed power and jumped from the Russian bed  to the U.S. bed, he tried to lessen the leftist presence in the  media. But the leftist remnants continued their activities. The  rulers, however, thought that it would be in their interest to  keep the leftists to confront the growing Islamic trend.    We now see that the present regime is giving those writers  whose hearts are imbued with hatred and rancor against Islam and  the Islamic movements free access to the national papers to  inject their poison against Islam and describe it with violence  and terrorism, using some acts of violence and the killings and  counter-killings between some youth and security and police  force as their pretext. These acts did not exist before, but  came as a result of the policy of suppression and intimidation,  economic crises, unemployment, increase in prices. These acts,  in addition to the government's policy of meeting violence with  violence, add fuel to the fire. The government's tolerance of  sinful practices such as drinking alcohol, gambling, usury,  prostitution, immoral media, and drugs seems to be an  intentional policy to create a balance between religiousness and  moral decadence.    We have been reading for some time now about planned  campaigns against some parties that are trying to protect  society from those who seek to spread corruption, cause  disintegration, and cast doubt on the faith. We notice that the  campaign harms the holy al-Azhar and its ulema, who over the  ages stood up against malicious campaigns against Islam, the  Egyptian nation's official religion according to the  Constitution.    Have the remnants of communism forgotten that Russia  considered religion the opiate of the people and that it  punished anyone in possession of a Koran or anyone who advocated  any religion other than communism? Where was the freedom of  opinion? Why didn't they object to this kind of suppression?    Islam, the righteous religion that God has chosen for his  people, is a religion of peace, freedom, justice, security, and  safety. Islam does not approve of any injustice by any party  against another and is unique in the sense that it promotes  virtue and suppresses vice. It is the duty of the nation's  ulema to balance things according to Islam's accurate scales and  to caution about what is good and what is bad. If a controversy  arises over an issue, it should be referred to God's book and to  the tradition of his Prophet, may God's prayer and salutation be  upon him. There is no human being who knows more about what is  good and what is bad for us than God and his messenger.    These malicious campaigns are launched by those who are  called the vanguard in enlightening public opinion about Islam's  darkness and shackles and who claim that religion has no  authority over art and literature. We should stand up to these  campaigns and refute them with unequivocal arguments. In the  first place, reality requires these bats to hide in their holes  and in the places of darkness and suppression where communism  lived, now that they cannot survive in the age of light in which  nations demand freedom and true representation. The people  should listen to each party's propaganda and then decide what is  right and what is wrong and what is beneficial and what is  corrupt.    We accept what society decides in genuine, fair elections.  But to devise laws marginalizing the Islamic trend and barring  this trend from actual participation in legislative elections or  to intervene by committing forgery and so forth contradicts the  creed of the much-abused democracy.    Had the ruling regime not encouraged this approach, no  magazine would have dared to publish this stuff, defying the  authority of law and the Constitution and even practically  annulling them and denigrating al-Azhar's role in protecting  society against any attempt to harm it. A society's value  depends on its adherence to virtuous principles and keeping away  from depraved morals. God, our creator, has laid down these  limits for us and explained what is good and what is bad; but to  confuse these limits is corruption itself, and we do not trust  the intentions of those who advocate such behavior.    We know that the enemies of Islam promote such ideas and  find  people among us who will cooperate with them in the name of  freedom.    This magazine's challenge, by publishing material  unanimously  deemed corrupt and mean by the judicial authorities, should not  be tolerated in silence by the holy al-Azhar and the Government  if they truly mean good for this country. The magazine's  publication of excerpts from the book ""The Satanic Verses""  despite the proven fact that the book attacks Islam and Islam's  prophet, is a flagrant declaration of war against Islam, the  faith of this Muslim nation.    Demonstrations and sacrifices were made in some countries  where parts of this book were published. Does the Government  realize the danger it poses when at a time when we need help to  stop acts of violence, the magazine is fueling the fire?    The government should have taken the necessary measures to  help create calm and stability by lifting restrictions on  liberties and releasing those who have not been incriminated.  The government should also stop the sinful practices such as  drinking alcohol, prostitution, and usury. It should rectify  the government media, which are full of corruption. The  government should be firm with both large-scale and small-time  thieves and should bring up generations on educational and  ethical methods.    The Cairo international book fair is approaching. We hope it  will be utilized to reform those with corrupt ideas, and not to  draw up a plan to harm values and ethics or give an opportunity  to those hiding behind the facade of the so-called enlightenment.    Let's review the scenes of struggle between the Muslims and  others so that we can see who is responsible for the acts of  violence and terrorism. Are they Muslims or others? Who are  the terrorists in Palestine? Is it the Zionists or the  stone-throwers who are defending their land, which the enemy has  usurped by means of force, killings, deportations, and  displacement? Who are the terrorists in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is  it the Muslims, who are defending their land and who are  deprived of weapons, or the Serbs and Croatians, who have killed  hundreds of thousands, raped tens of thousands of women, and  evicted hundreds of thousands?    Who are the terrorists in Kashmir? Are they the Muslims, who  have been defending their usurped freedom over the past 40  years, or the Hindu soldiers, who are committing atrocities  similar to those being committed in Bosnia-Herzegovina? In  Cambodia, the Buddhists are killing hundreds of thousands of  Muslims and no one is doing anything to protect the oppressed  there. These tragedies are a lasting disgrace for the whole  world, which remains silent about these acts. It is also a  lasting disgrace in the history of the Arab and Islamic world,  which has not taken the appropriate stand dictated by the creed  of their peoples--a creed that calls for unity.    If we look at the international situation, we will find that  the oppressed Muslims are standing fast, enduring, and remaining  firm; they have not relinquished their creed or their land.  Those Muslims are hopeful that God will support them and will  grant them victory ?one day.    Here in Egypt we see that despite the harassment of the  Islamic trend, the Islamists won victories in the elections in  the professional associations and various university faculty  clubs. The Islamists scored victories despite the government's  unified trade union law, which is difficult to surmount. But  the Islamists were prepared for the elections and managed to  surmount the obstacles. Perhaps the government is thinking of  another solution or of placing more difficult obstacles. But we  tell all these people [not further specified] not to swim  against the current. We are full of hope that God will not  abandon his faithful people and will support righteousness and  will destroy falsehood and its advocates. And God hath full  power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know  it not [Koranic verse].    Out of sympathy, I advise them to reconsider their position  because they will not be able to impede this Islamic awakening.  Nor will they be able to dissuade the Egyptian people from  demanding the adoption of God's law. God will uphold  righteousness and will destroy falsehood. This is God's way and  it will not be thwarted. It is better for them and for the  country to save their efforts and not to stir up tension,  because we need calm and cooperation. I only desire your  betterment to the best of my power; and my success in my task  can only come from God. [Koranic verse]     "

The fact that the bomb was thrown on a Saturday [5  February],  when the people of Sarajevo go out with family, and the fact  that it was thrown at a market place where there are large  crowds, is irrefutable proof of the absolute necessity to stop  the crazed and merciless aggressor.    We strongly condemn this latest act of savagery committed  against the people of Sarajevo almost as if in provocation. This  place was visited by our prime minister and minister a few days  ago to observe the unacceptable conditions and problems of these  people, and we promised them help. We reiterate to the world  the call made by our prime minister to stop these inhuman  incidents.    The attacks and inhuman acts being perpetrated against  Sarajevo can be stopped in two ways: The first is by means of  international intervention. Turkey is ready to participate in  intervention where NATO's means are also used.    The second is this: If the international community is  incapable of intervening at this stage, then it must enable  Bosnia-Herzegovina to protect itself.

0,FT933-9606 ,"FT933-9606 _AN-DHIDBACHFT 930809   FT  09 AUG 93 / Arts: Isadora's Day - Dance      By CLEMENT CRISP   Isadora] The first name is enough, and she haunts us still. Whatever Isadora Duncan was in her life - free soul and freed body, the inspirational dancer of her great years or the sagging relic of the last days in Nice - she reverberates through the artistic consciousness of our century as have few other women. Extraordinarily, for a dancer whose legacy to us is no more than a frayed reputation and some glorious photographic images, Isadora still inspires, is still emulated. So, on Wednesday, the Royal Festival Hall's jolly Ballroom Blitz season (all kinds of dance for all kinds of people) held a Duncan Day. There were videos, classes, a performance of dances from Gluck's Orfeo (some ascribed to Duncan, others made in what is believed to be her style) by performers from Moscow, Paris and London, to indicate the continuing and persistent image of that heroic figure whom we see caught between the portals of the Parthenon by Edward Steichen's camera. Today Duncan's life matters less - typical of her as it was in its enthusiasms and impracticalities - than the idea of what she did. Gordon Craig, father of one of her children, told of the excitement of her presence. 'She was speaking her own language . . . and she was telling to the air the very things we longed to hear and until she came we never dreamed we should hear; and now we heard them, and this sent us all into an unusual state of joy.' This image of the ecstatic dancer, immeasurably beautiful in her message, is what her public and her pupils treasured, and it is one we treasure still. No film exists of Duncan. We know her through legend, through myriad drawings, through Steichen's and Steiglitz's photographs. 'Duncanism', as a way of movement, was perpetuated after her death by pupils, but little of what I have seen of reconstructions has persuaded me that this could inspire artists and thrill audiences as did Duncan's every move. Probably the best indications of Duncan's manner came from Ashton's Brahms' Waltzes for Lynn Seymour, where dancer and dance beautifully imagined her presence; from Vivienne Pickle's astonishing impersonation in Ken Russell's television study; and from the joint performances of Merle Park and Mary Miller in MacMillan's Isadora. What we sensed in these homages was the intoxication of Duncan's movement, and its communicative grace and power. Wednesday's dutiful exposition by dancers and pupils from the Moscow School of Music and Movement, and the London-based Isadora Duncan Dance Group, was something altogether more sober-sided - not a quality one would associate with Duncan. At its best, in Orfeo's two Laments and the Dance of the Blessed Spirits, the dance had a simplicity and a gestural clarity (arms slowly raised, bodies held in sculptural poses) that touchingly told of Duncan's worship of the antique. Other sequences were too innocent in means, and what was proposed as Duncan's own dances for the Furies did no service to her memory or to Gluck. Yet Isadora still speaks to dancers, be it in spirit messages - which these dances really were - or as educational example. The Duncan Dance Group plainly reveres her example. A Moscow Duncan Academy existed until 1946. (Duncan went to Russia in 1921 to teach the children of its new society to dance.) The Moscow performers are from a school lately founded to provide training inspired by Duncan's ideals. Edward Gordon Craig said that Duncan's dancing was 'Something uttered on the divine theme'. We can do worse for the young than show them this.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P7922 Theatrical Producers and Services.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

0,FT944-10002 ,"FT944-10002 _AN-EKMASADTFT 941112   FT  12 NOV 94 / Perspectives: The positive side of NO - The Nature of Things / Clive Cookson looks at a simple, unassuming little molecule that can both kill and cure      By CLIVE COOKSON   Some things are so small and unobtrusive that you fail to notice their presence, even though they are doing useful work all around you. The most striking example in science is nitric oxide - NO - which was regarded until recently as a boring and insignificant little molecule but is now known to be one of the most important of all natural chemicals. Scientists used to think of NO just as a polluting gas emitted by power stations and car exhausts. But over the past seven years they have discovered that NO performs an astonishingly wide range of biological roles, from laying down memories in the brain to controlling blood pressure, from killing germs and cancer cells to preventing premature birth. Indeed this simple molecule - one oxygen atom joined to one nitrogen - is probably both the smallest of all biologically active substances and the most diverse in its functions. This makes it rather embarrassing for science that biological NO remained undiscovered for so long. One reason is that for decades molecular biologists had been finding more and more complexity in living systems. They were trained to look for large organic molecules whose functions were determined by their shape - the classic image is the chemical key fitting into a lock - and they did not imagine that a simple inorganic gas such as NO could play such an important role. No one individual can take credit for revealing the significance of NO. This has emerged from the convergence of research into several distinct phenomena, including the expansion and contraction of blood vessels, cell killing by the immune system, and chemical signalling in the brain. NO was first proved to be produced by living systems in 1987, when scientists at the Wellcome Research Laboratories in Kent detected tiny 'puffs' of NO, given off by cells in the lining of blood vessels to make the vessel walls contract. Subsequent research has shown that NO plays a wide role in controlling blood pressure and in maintaining the health of the heart and blood system. It is also a general-purpose muscle relaxant in the body. These observations cleared up several mysteries in pharmacology. One was the action of the nitrate drugs used since the 19th century to treat angina. It turns out that the nitrate breaks down in the body to release NO, which dilates the arteries and allows more blood to reach the heart. New applications for NO's muscle-relaxing powers are already emerging. One is a nitrate-releasing skin patch which delays the onset of labour in women who would otherwise give birth prematurely. In the immune system, NO plays a quite different and far more aggressive role. It is the long sought toxic agent released by macrophages - mobile blood cells that kill invading germs and proliferating cancer cells. Macrophages give off much larger puffs of NO than cells in blood vessels. The process does not normally harm the human host because NO acts over a very short range and dissipates rapidly, lasting no more than a few seconds in the body. But it can kill someone who is overwhelmed with a bacterial infection, releasing a huge excess of NO that reduces blood pressure to a lethally low level. This is now believed to be the mechanism by which people die of 'septic shock'. Excessive release over a longer period may also cause trouble. Scientists are beginning to blame NO for the damage inflicted by auto-immune diseases such as diabetes. NO's third main theatre of activity, in the brain and nervous system, involves the smallest puffs of gas. Its role as a neurotransmitter - sending chemical signals between nerve cells - is the most recently discovered and is still far from being well understood. Scientists believe, however, that NO plays an essential part in laying down memory through 'long-term potentiation', a poorly characterised process by which neural pathways change through repeated stimulation. In the brain, as elsewhere, NO is a Jekyll-and-Hyde molecule. Under the right conditions, it not only acts as an essential neurotransmitter but also protects nerve cells against stress. When things go wrong, NO poisons the brain. It is implicated in a wide range of neurological disorders, including senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, stroke and epilepsy. NO research has not been going long enough for scientists to know what tilts the balance between Jekyll and Hyde, let alone how to intervene in Dr Jekyll's favour. It is not just a matter of a little NO being good and too much being bad; other factors, such as the acidity of its surroundings, affect the molecule's behaviour. Now that NO's importance is universally acknowledged, thousands of scientists are working on it. Academics are elucidating its fundamental mechanisms of action while pharmaceutical researchers try to develop drugs, either to deliver more NO to cells where there is too little or to inhibit its formation where there is an excess. Although some of the first drugs designed with a knowledge of NO are beginning clinical trials, the timescales of the pharmaceutical industry mean that they will not make a big impact on medicine for several years. The immediate lesson of NO is that biologists should not be so obsessed with interactions between complex and highly specialised molecules that they ignore the work done by simple gases. NO may not be the only one with unsuspected biological functions. Ethylene (CH) is a ripening hormone in plants and may play a role in animals too. And there is recent evidence that carbon monoxide (CO) acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. More generally, NO shows again how scientists can be so caught up by the prevailing paradigm that they ignore important evidence that is, in retrospect, obvious. In practice, though, there may be no other way for science to proceed, without changing human nature.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

On presenting  his land's report on the protection of the constitution in  Dusseldorf on Wednesday [27 April], Schnoor pointed out that the  party is using a middle-class camouflage, while relying more  than ever on xenophobic propaganda. Individual members are even  prepared to use violence against foreigners.    While stating that the Republikaner tend toward right-wing  extremism, Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian  Democratic Union) on the other hand, merely called them a  right-wing radical group recently.    According to Schnoor, in the run-up to the elections the  Republikaner are increasingly joined by new members sharing a  firm right-wing extremist view of the world. Last year, they  increased their membership in North Rhine-Westphalia from 2,100  to 2,500. The constitution protection report speaks of a total  of 25 right-wing extremist and neo-Nazi parties and groups with  a membership of 9,200 in 1993. The previous year there had been  23 organizations with 8,800 members. The biggest right-wing  extremist party is the German People's Union with 5,000 members.    The number of politically motivated incidences of violence  in  North Rhine-Westphalia shows a large increase. Last year, there  were a total of 827 acts of violence carried out against a  political background, which is almost 20 percent more than in  1992, Schnoor said. Xenophobia was the motive for more than 50  percent of all attacks.     "

Thus, the Ministry of  Interior appeals to the brother citizens to observe the  following:    1. Not to carry weapons throughout the Republic's  governorates, even if their carriage is licensed, and also not  to open fire regardless of justification.    2. Not to hold any meetings, gatherings, crowds,  demonstrations, or similar things.    3. Not to carry out any acts aimed at looting or  encroaching on public and private properties.    4.

Saying the Japanese Government authorities' preparation of  the ""legislative arrangements"", choosing the DPRK as an  imaginary ""enemy"", is an extremely dangerous anti-peace,  anti-democratic move, the appeal strongly urged them to give up  the preparation and strictly control criminal acts against  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.

This  gang is arresting and torturing these nationals, and forcing  them to make false confessions that they are engaged in alleged  military actions. They are being portrayed as prisoners of war  captured in the battlefield.    These criminal acts are manifestations of cheap blackmail.  Similarly, they are lowly attempts to delude the world into  believing that the countries of these innocent victims are  involved in the Yemeni crisis. These cheap acts, and similar  other criminal and inhuman acts, such as using the elderly,  women, and children as human shields; dropping booby-trapped  pens, toys, and sweets to kill innocent children; and using  banned missiles of mass destruction run counter to all universal  conventions. Likewise, they violate the Geneva conventions and  their two supplementary protocols.    While denouncing these criminal acts, the Yemeni Peace and  Solidarity Council urges all international organizations, and  the International Committee of the Red Cross to condemn these  violations of human values and principles, and international  norms and conventions, as well. It also urges them to vindicate  the Yemeni people and support them against the enemies of their  unity, constitutional legitimacy, and democratic experiment.     "

But Santa Fe doesn't work that way.    John Crosby's idealistic company concentrates, much of the time, on unhackneyed  repertory. Employing essentially youthful casts and imaginative directors,  Santa Fe tries to take opera, the most irrational of art forms, seriously as  musical drama.    Santa Fe may not always succeed. At least it tries.    It is trying this summer with five new productions. Only two of them -- Richard  Strauss' ""Rosenkavalier"" and Verdi's ""Traviata"" -- can be classified as  conventional.    Celebrating the unconventional, the current agenda includes the first  professional staging in America of a long-forgotten example of perfumed Gallic  trivia, Massenet's ""Cherubin"" (1905), not to mention an ambitious exhumation of  an ultra-Baroque extravaganza, Cavalli's ""La Calisto"" (1651). Even more  newsworthy, however, is the U.S. premiere of Judith Weir's ""A Night at the  Chinese Opera.""(1987).    A new-wave-chic entry from Britain, it was commissioned by the BBC and much  praised when first performed by the Kent Opera in Cheltenham. Serving as her  own librettist, Weir has concocted a fascinatingly complex musico-theatrical  package that wants desperately to seem simple.    Born in 1954, raised in Scotland, trained mostly in London (briefly, in the  States), influenced, to a degree, by the likes of Stravinsky, Britten and  Messiaen, she has dropped an imposing calling card with this, her first  full-scale grown-up opera. Los Angeles, incidentally, made her acquaintance in  March, 1988, when the Monday Evening Concerts mustered the American premiere of  ""The Consolations of Scholarship,"" a 25-minute scena for soprano and nine  players predicated on 13th-Century Yuan dramas.    ""A Night at the Chinese Opera,"" seen here Wednesday, shares a similar  inspiration. Weir has, for some time, been preoccupied with the stark rituals  of Asian narrative, although she filters the ancient impulses through  distinctly modern sensibilities.    In this opus, she introduces herself as a virtuoso juggler. In an hour and 40  minutes (the timing excludes two mood-shattering intermissions), she manages to  juxtapose farce and tragedy, realism and stylization, symbolism and fantasy,  vaudeville and political satire, always with creative strokes that are  extraordinarily bold, economical, swift and deft.    The outer acts focus, with mock-Brechtian objectivity, on the plight of Chao  Lin, an innocent canal builder oppressed by Mongolian rule in the era of Marco  Polo. The central act, a startling opera within the opera, concentrates on the  parodistic parallel of an actual Yuan play, ""The Orphan of the Chao Family.""    Weir tells her multilayered tale in bleak Western tones cleverly ornamented  with colorful imitation-Eastern accents. She speaks a fragile, concise,  inventive musical language enhanced by subtle dynamic effects reliant on  primitive harmonic constructions.    The vocal lines, craftily stressed and supported by a percussive  chamber-orchestra, span formal speech, expressive parlando, expanded  declamation, agitated recitative and, occasionally, poignant lyricism. The  composer even interpolates a caricature Italian-tenor aria for Marco Polo, who  makes an irreverently amusing cameo appearance in the third act.    For all its gutsy, extrovert trappings, the opera remains a fragile,  introspective creation that seems to demand an intimate hall and a sensitive  directorial touch. Unfortunately, Santa Fe couldn't provide the former and  didn't provide the latter.    The crafty words and muted emotional climaxes tended to get blurred in the wide  open spaces. The dramatic affect tended to get blunted in the heavy-handed,  gag-oriented staging of Robert Carsen (remembered for his ersatz-Sellars  ""Marriage of Figaro"" this season in Long Beach).    Ever resourceful when it comes to trendy cliches, Carsen interpolated tai-chi  exercises for the cast before the music began, sent his protagonists into the  auditorium in quest of false immediacy, and eventually blinded the audience  with flashing searchlights, all for no apparent reason. Not content with such  extra-operatic distractions, he reduced the Yuan play to a plodding burlesque  that even dishonored the Marx Brothers allusion of the title.    He did elicit neatly focused performances, however, from such hard-working,  versatile singing actors as John David de Haan, Drew Minter, John Kuether,  Philip Zawisza, Judith Christin, Kathryn Gamberoni, Douglas Perry, James  Busterud, Joyce Castle and Anthony Laciura.

0,FT944-831 ,"FT944-831 _AN-ELWCWADHFT 941223   FT  23 DEC 94 / Observer: Aladin's lamp in Grozny   What was the chief of Jordan's military intelligence - Ahmad Aladin Arsala - doing recently in Grozny, the Russian-besieged capital of Chechnya? To say that he was having a cosy chat with Russif Shamsuddin - Chechnya's Jordanian-born foreign minister - hardly clears up the mystery. The waters are further muddied by news that one of Jordan's leading parliamentarians has now begun enlisting volunteers to help the Chechnyan resistance fight Russian troops. For an insight, step back to the early 19th century, when the Ottomans set up a military garrison in (what is now) Amman, employing conscripts from the Caucasus. When Prince Abdullah, King Hussein's grandfather, became the first ruler of the emirate of TransJordan in 1921, he won Circassian and Chechen hearts and minds by giving important government posts to their nationals. Today, Jordan's 80,000-strong Caucasian community remains fiercely loyal to their adopted country; an elite group acts as the ceremonial bodyguard to King Hussein. But they also retain strong feelings for their Caucasian roots. Since the Russian-Chechnya conflict erupted, many more than usual have taken advantage of the resumption of flights to Moscow by the Royal Jordanian airline - including a delegation of Circassian political figures from Jordan, accompanied by Ahmad Aladin Arsala. This plot is positively congealing; even Jimmy Carter may need more than a couple of days to square the Circassian circle.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.     JOZ  Jordan, Middle East.

So far the Majles has researched and investigated at various  levels in numerous instances having to do with the performance  of organizations, bodies and management, in implementation of  Article 67 of the Constitution. However, none have received  reactions on the scale of the latest incident. Perhaps this is  for the following reasons:    A. The performance of the Voice and Vision organization, as  the most important pillar of the fourth power, with its  effective and fateful role and society, has never been  officially examined and supervised in the period since the  triumph of the Islamic revolution. Since the revision of the  Constitution, the Voice and Vision organization has been under  the direct supervision of the vice-regent, and some have thought  that a body under the leader's supervision should not be studied  and subjected to research and investigation. At the time the  research and investigation of the performance of the Voice and  Vision organization was proposed, his excellency clearly stated:    ""Study it carefully, do the research and investigation, and  study individuals, too.""    B. After the research and investigation report was read in  the Majles, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization,  continuing his illegal measures, took an official position  against research and investigation on the Voice of the Majles.  He drew boundaries and directions for the Majles, and by  creating public controversy and intimidating the deputies, he  tried to keep the Majles from performing its lawful  responsibilities. He threatened that if things were said in the  open Majles sessions that he judged to be incorrect, they would  be answered in Voice and Vision programming.    C. The continuation of the illegal measures involving the  personal use of the Voice and Vision and the failure to heed  notices given caused the exalted leader to intervene and prevent  the radio broadcast of further installments of the answer to the  Majles from the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization.  The unworthy acts of the supervisor of the Voice and Vision  organization were that in subsequent portions of the answer to  the Majles and also on his answer to the statement given to the  press from the Majles public relations office, he made  inappropriate and distorted use of the Constitution and ordinary  laws to try to justify broadcasting his answer over the radio.  Instead of apologizing to the leader and the Majles and  realizing the illegality of his willful use of the resources of  the Voice and Vision organization, he continued to insist on his  position.    Did any of the Majles deputies, the Friday imams, clergymen  or writers who took a position on this matter prevent the  supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization from pursuing  the issues in the research and investigation through legal  channels? No, everyone said and wrote that if he believed his  honor had been attacked or if his rights had been violated, he  should pursue the matter through lawful authorities, but he  cannot violate the Constitution and ordinary laws, including  Article 49 of the Law on the General Policies and Principles of  the Programs of the Voice and Vision organization, which  emphatically prohibit any kind of illegal activity in the  country, by laying the groundwork for heresy that distorts to  high heaven.    Article 6 of the Law on the General Policies and Principles  of the Programs of the Voice and Vision Organization, which  happens also to have been cited by the manager of the Voice and  Vision organization, states: respect the human dignity of  individuals and refrain from affronting their honor, in  accordance with Islamic regulations."" In the answer from the  Voice and Vision organization, which was broadcast over the  radio, this provision was clearly violated, and the honor of the  Majles deputies was affronted.    If it is to be established in an Islamic system, which  negates selfishness, that individuals can promote their ideas by  intimidating the nation's lawful bodies, the edifice will not  stand. This is the issue that took the issue of the research and  investigation of the performance of the Voice and Vision  organization beyond the ordinary course of events, and the  controversy will continue as long as there is continued refusal  to submit to the law.    The philosophy of research and investigation depends on the  proper conduct of affairs, the discovery of incorrectness and  distortions, and dealing with violators. Its purpose will be  defeated if the body or individuals being investigated and  researched heedlessly continue with what they were doing.    The roots of many problems and violations in some bodies and  organizations are to be found in selfishness and the failure to  submit to laws. If these roots are not cut off, they will grow  again and their branches and leaves will be everywhere.     "

Van Horn, Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Patent Policy and Projects, and addressed as above.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Public Law No. 103182 (November 4, 1993) implementing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), amended 35 U.S.C. 104 to provide that for the purpose of obtaining a patent, an applicant can show a date of invention in the United States, or in a NAFTA country which occurred after the date of implementation (i.e., December 8, 1993). Although GATT enabling legislation has not been passed, these proposed rule changes assume that it will be passed, and therefore changes to 37 CFR 1.131(a) similar to NAFTA would be required. See Article 27, paragraph 1, of the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Including Trade in Counterfeit Goods, of the GATT. In the event that the GATT enabling legislation is not enacted when the final rules are published, the proposed rule changes relative to the GATT will be withdrawn.        The Office proposes to amend 37 CFR 1.131(a), which is currently limited to facts showing a completion of the invention in the United States, to allow for a submission of facts in an affidavit or declaration that show completion of the invention in a NAFTA or a World Trade Organization (WTO) Member country. The WTO is established under the GATT agreement to resolve disputes between signatories to the agreement. The facts presented must demonstrate completion of the invention prior to the effective date of a reference thought to bar the grant of a patent or the patentability of a claim in a patent under reexamination.    Additionally, the Office recognizes that there is a potential conflict between existing 37 CFR 1.131(a) and 37 CFR 1.602(a). Section 1.131(a) prohibits affidavits or declarations thereunder when the same patentable invention as defined in 37 CFR 1.601(n) (i.e., patentably indistinct inventions) is claimed. An interference under 35 U.S.C. 135, rather than antedating under 1.131(a), is generally the available remedy. However, 37 CFR 1.602(a) provides that when the applications or the application and patent are owned by a single party, interferences are not declared or continued unless good cause is shown. This can result in a hardship where there is an issued patent that can no longer be amended as by filing a continuation-in-part application. Where there are two or more pending applications, the conflict can be avoided by filing a continuation-in-part application incorporating the conflicting inventions in a single application.    The Office proposes to amend 37 CFR 1.131 to broaden its application to a single party where inventions of a pending application and a patent held by the party are patentably indistinct but not identical. Under the proposed additions to 1.131, an affidavit or declaration could be filed by a party to avoid a 35 U.S.C. 103 rejection based on a 35 U.S.C. 102(a) or (e) patent owned by that party, where the patent claimed an invention that was patentably indistinct, but not identical to an invention claimed in an application or patent undergoing reexamination.    The proposed addition to 1.131 would not affect the use of the issued patent in a rejection based on double patenting. However, where patentably indistinct but not identical inventions are claimed, a double patenting rejection can be avoided by filing an appropriate terminal disclaimer. In addition, petitions under 1.183 will be entertained for waiver of 1.131 requirements in appropriate instances where two pending applications claiming patentably indistinct but not identical inventions are held by a single party.        Discussion of Specific Rules        Section 1.131(a), if amended to (a)(1) as proposed, would allow a 1.131 affiant or declarant to rely upon facts occurring in a NAFTA or a WTO Member country to show completion of the invention. The term ``domestic'' would be changed to ``U.S.'' The section is proposed to be amended from a single sentence to three sentences.    Section 1.131(a)(2), if added as proposed, would limit the availability of acts showing completion of the invention in a NAFTA or WTO Member country to those acts occurring subsequent to the effective date of the agreements.

This can result in a hardship where there is an issued patent that can no longer be amended as by filing a continuation-in-part application. Where there are two or more pending applications, the conflict can be avoided by filing a continuation-in-part application incorporating the conflicting inventions in a single application.    The Office proposes to amend 37 CFR 1.131 to broaden its application to a single party where inventions of a pending application and a patent held by the party are patentably indistinct but not identical. Under the proposed additions to 1.131, an affidavit or declaration could be filed by a party to avoid a 35 U.S.C. 103 rejection based on a 35 U.S.C. 102(a) or (e) patent owned by that party, where the patent claimed an invention that was patentably indistinct, but not identical to an invention claimed in an application or patent undergoing reexamination.    The proposed addition to 1.131 would not affect the use of the issued patent in a rejection based on double patenting. However, where patentably indistinct but not identical inventions are claimed, a double patenting rejection can be avoided by filing an appropriate terminal disclaimer. In addition, petitions under 1.183 will be entertained for waiver of 1.131 requirements in appropriate instances where two pending applications claiming patentably indistinct but not identical inventions are held by a single party.        Discussion of Specific Rules        Section 1.131(a), if amended to (a)(1) as proposed, would allow a 1.131 affiant or declarant to rely upon facts occurring in a NAFTA or a WTO Member country to show completion of the invention. The term ``domestic'' would be changed to ``U.S.'' The section is proposed to be amended from a single sentence to three sentences.    Section 1.131(a)(2), if added as proposed, would limit the availability of acts showing completion of the invention in a NAFTA or WTO Member country to those acts occurring subsequent to the effective date of the agreements.

The move reflects a drive by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to clear old disputes before the new tougher disputes settlement procedure under the World Trade Organisation comes into effect next year. The panel report in question ruled in late-1992 that the US had not complied with Gatt's anti-dumping code in putting duties of up to 32 per cent on imports of Norwegian salmon. However, several signatories of the voluntary code, including paradoxically Norway itself, were unhappy about some aspects of the report's analysis. They agreed to adopt the report only after assurances from Mr Jose Graca Lima of Brazil, chairman of the anti-dumping committee, that it did not apply to countries not involved in the specific dispute 'nor does it represent binding legal precedents applicable to other disputes'. Gatt officials admit that the present disputes procedure has conflicting objectives in trying to settle trade rows by mutual agreement and developing Gatt case-law. The WTO's semi-juridical disputes system will, by contrast, focus almost exclus-ively on securing conformity with strengthened fair trade rules. Separately, the members of the anti-dumping committee agreed to set up a panel, under current procedures, to investigate a complaint by Brazil that US duties on imports of cotton yarn from Brazil violate Gatt rules.

It contained a number of  contradictions, prevarications, and false claims which, we know  perfectly well, did not emanate from these two brothers or have  anything to do with the code of honor, struggle, and military  solidarity we committed ourselves to as far back as the first  day we decided that confrontation with the unjust regime in the  homeland was inevitable.""    Colonel Salih al-Habbuni and Lieutenant Colonel 'Abdallah  al-Shaykhi had issued a statement saying that LNA Commander  Colonel Khalifah Haftar had lost all his leadership posts and  that the army was one of the institutions of the National Front  for the Salvation of Libya [NFSL], the opposition faction which  has suffered a split.    Haftar, it should be recalled, had signed the secession  statement and announced the withdrawal of all the opposition  army's officers and soldiers from the NFSL.    The statement of the officers and soldiers said: ""These two  brothers were used by certain parties as a tool to break our  fighters' unity of ranks and purpose.... We reject the plots  hatched against our National Army and the fact that some of its  members are implicated in cheap destructive attempts and are  being used by an individual or a group as an instrument for the  fulfillment of power ambitions and temporary selfish gains.""    They also declared:    ""1. The LNA rejects everything in the statement issued by  these two comrades and see the issuing of that statement in  their names as a cheap and failed attempt to undermine the unity  of our patriotic forces. Despite that, we give them a chance to  reconsider their position and to rejoin their comrades in arms  in the same trench. We remind them of the military honor and  the historic responsibility entrusted to us by our brothers and  our people. They should, before it is too late, realize the  seriousness of slipping into such cheap attempts perpetrated by  power-mad individuals.    ""2. The LNA reaffirms its absolute commitment as an integral  military unit to the declaration made by Commander in Chief  Staff Col. Khalifah Abu-al-Qasim Haftar, that the LNA has left  the NFSL and severed all organizational links with it and would  not abide by any decision or directive issued by it.    ""3. The LNA declares that the statements made by the NFSL  Secretary General (Muhammad al-Muqaryif) on the appointment of a  new LNA command was but a link in the cheap plot against the LNA  unity and cohesion in the service of his own personal aims and  interests, and a manifestation of the autocratic and domineering  spirit which was one of the reasons why many, including the LNA,  have abandoned the NFSL. The LNA rejects all kinds of hegemony  and blind domineering, refuses to be led by anyone other than  its honorable sons, rejects the ignorant methods of charting its  national struggle, rejects all the statements and decisions made  by the NFSL's secretary general, considering them to be  tantamount to interference in its affairs, and announces its  adherence to its command, options, and struggle programs.    ""4. The LNA is an integral part of the Libyan partriotic  armed forces at home for it was born out of these forces and  made of their strugglers, and it belongs to the entire homeland  and to all the Libyan people. It declares to everyone that it  will not relent nor will it stop fighting the corrupt regime  imposing itself on our country and people, and will join hands  will all honorable men to wage the battle of liberation. It  most confidently, strongly, and unitedly renews the pledge and  promise to its Commander Haftar that it will resolutely continue  the struggle with heroic determination and patience until final  salvation and definite victory.""    The statement was signed by the following officers: Captains  Nasr al-Din al-Sadiq Karmus, Salim 'Abd-al-Salam al-Zuyaghn,  'Abdallah al-Asghar, 'Abd-al-'Azim Muhammad Yusuf, Salah  Muhammad Shu'ayb, Sa'id al-Bal'azi, Musaddiq al-Fanidi, Sa'd  al-Ghazal Madi, 'Ali 'Ashur, and Abu-Sha'alah Ibrahim; First  Lieutenants al-Asmar 'Abd-al-Salam Ibridge, 'Adil Abu-Zayd  al-Hajjaji, and Muhammad Tahir Rashid; and Second Lieutenants  Milad Ibrahim Abu-Zahw and Misbah Mas'ud al-Farajani.

Michael Fay, 18, was convicted last week of spray painting cars and being in possession of Singapore flags and road signs. The teenager, a student at the Singapore American school when the offences were committed, was sentenced to six strokes of the rotan (a heavy cane), four months jail and fined SDollars 3,500 (Pounds 1,480). Mr Ralph Boyce, acting US ambassador in Singapore, said there was a large discrepancy between offence and punishment. Mr Boyce said the paint was removed from the cars with thinner. However 'caning leaves permanent scars' said the diplomat. 'In addition, the accused is a teenager and this is his first offence.' Fay's stepfather is the Singapore-based regional executive of Federal Express, the US courier company. The American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore said it could not understand how the government could condone the permanent scarring of any 18 year old - American or Singaporean - for such an offence. 'It is impossible to predict how this will affect American business activity but it is likely to cast a cloud over Singapore's international reputation,' said the chamber. The US is the biggest investor in Singapore. Singapore's ministry of home affairs said that unlike some other societies which may tolerate acts of vandalism, Singapore had its own standards of social order as reflected in its laws.

Brig. Gen. Regino Lacson, Army 2d Infantry Division  commanding general, said that last week alone, small teams of  communist guerrilla terrorists attacked several groups of  civilians in mountain barangays [villages] in three provinces.    In Barangay Casay, Lupi, Camarines Sur, last 24 March,  rebels  fired a grenade from an M-203 launcher at a ""pulong-pulong""  [gathering] of residents who were planning a livelihood project  in cooperation with the military. A barangay captain, a woman  and her seven-year-old son were wounded during the attack while  scores of other residents were injured in the stampede for  safety.    In a resettlement area in Barangay Caldon, Sampaloc, Quezon,  three suspected NPA rebels sprayed another gathering of  civilians, wounding a resident identified only as a certain  ""Boy"" of the barangay last 20 March.    Last 25 March, at Barangay Salipsip, Polilio, Quezon, rebels  fired on a house during a heavy rainfall.    Elements of the 236 PNP [Philippine National Police] Mobile  Force who had taken cover from the rain in the house fired back  at the rebels and a firefight that lasted for about 30 minutes  ensued.    Residents said that three dead rebels were carried away by  their companions when they escaped and policemen recovered from  the encounter scene one M16 Armalite rifle.     "

""According to our information, President Mubarak, who is  displeased with the disappearance of Mr. al-Kikhya, has given  his orders to competent authorities to do all that is possible  in order to clarify this matter,"" said Muhammad Jibril, who  represents the National Front for the Salvation of Libya in  Cairo.    He said the Front had urged Mubarak to ""adopt a firm stand""  against the party responsible for the abduction of al-Kikhya,  leader of the National Rally which is opposed to Libya's leader  Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi.    Jibril said the ""silence"" which had prevailed over the past  week over al-Kikhya's case only encouraged al-Qadhdhafi to  commit other similar acts against members of the opposition.    The opposition had accused Libyan agents of kidnapping  al-Kikhya who vanished on December 11 after leaving his hotel in  Cairo where he was attending an Arab human rights conference.  Libya denied last week any involvement in the affair, saying  al-Kikhya was the victim of a feud between opposition groups.    ""This silence gives way to other regimes to kidnap or  liquidate dissidents living in Egypt,"" Jibril added.    The Egyptian president's political advisor, 'Usamah al-Baz,  found no cooperation from Libyan officials during a visit to  Tripoli on December 19 aimed at tracing the 63-year-old  al-Kikhya, who was foreign minister under al-Qadhdhafi in the  1970s and represented Libya at the United Nations between 1976  and 1980.

The FIS reaction came less than 24 hours after the Algerian  Presidential Office announced that Major General Zeroual had  held personal contacts with the jailed FIS leaders, who asked  Sheiks Ali Jedi and Abd el Qader Bou Khamkham to work to halt  acts of violence.    In a related development, informed Algerian sources informed  AL- HAYAH that the Algerian Army continues to ""initiate"" battles  with armed group members, and that it is waging ""a calculated""  war against them. The Army's withdrawal from a certain area,  the sources continued, does not mean that it is incapable of  confronting these groups. Any military move hinges upon a  full-blown and calculated plan, the sources maintained.    The sources declined to delve into military details.  Nonetheless, they underscored the Army's cohesion, unity, and  ability to keep things under control. They noted that the Army  is currently engaged in large-scale pursuit operations against  gunmen.

It was high off the ground, and shaped something like an  18th-Century sedan chair.    I was at that time a reporter for the March Field Courier, a newspaper that  served all 36 Southern California camps of the Civilian Conservation Corps, and  I drove that car all over our southern mountain ranges, going from camp to camp  for news.

They packed the car with food, water, oil, tire patches, inner tubes, a tire  casing, a pump and other tools, and pooled their life savings -- $26. They set  out at 4:30 a.m., taking Western Avenue to the Coast Highway and heading south  for Tijuana. (They wanted to say they had been in Mexico.)    They drove on to Calexico and then headed through the desert toward Yuma. Those  who did not live in that era must realize that the roads in the Southwest were  primitive, gas stations were a day apart, and one might travel for hours  without meeting a car coming in the other direction.    They camped that night in Yuma. Next morning they learned that the only road to  Phoenix began with the notorious Plank Road, a road made of railroad ties  chained together and stretched over the sand dunes for miles. Every mile or so  a widened section allowed cars to pull out or pass. They met only one car: a  party from Philadelphia who were too inept to back up to a pull-out place. The  boys did it for them.    When the Plank Road over the sand dunes ended, they camped out a night, then  followed a narrow, lonely desert road into Painted Rocks, Gila Bend and finally  Phoenix. They camped out of town in a grove of trees by a cool, clear stream,  then set out the next morning for home through Wickenburg, Aguila, Wenden,  Salome and Quartzsite, where they had a harrowing near-tragedy.    A fallen wooden arrow sign said MINE. They followed the rutted road about a  mile and came to an old mining shack beside a pit about seven feet across. They  couldn't see the bottom. An old wooden ladder hung down into the pit. Bob  decided to see where it led. He climbed down about 15 rungs, brushing off  spider webs; then a rung broke under his feet.

Paragraph (a) states the relevant dates of coverage. Paragraph (b) repeats the provision of section 224(a) that limits coverage to claims for damage for personal injury or death resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or related functions. Paragraph (c) states that for covered individuals, only acts or omissions within the scope of their employment (or contract for services, in the case of covered contractors) are covered. Thus, for example, ``moonlighting'' activities of a physician employed by a covered grantee would not be covered.  Paragraph (d) of proposed 6.6 addresses the limitation that only acts or omissions related to the grant-supported activity are covered. The Department is aware that there has been some confusion since the enactment of section 224(g) about the types of activities that would be covered. In particular, there have been questions about the issue of when coverage is available where individuals who are not registered patients of the grantee are treated. This paragraph provides clear standards for answering these questions. Coverage will be available for the treatment of non-patients of the covered entities only when the Secretary determines either that (1) the provision of the services to such individuals benefits patients of the entity and general populations that could be served by the entity through community-wide intervention efforts within the communities served by the entity, or (2) the provision of services to such individuals facilitates the provision of services to patients of the entity, or (3) such services are otherwise required to be provided to such individuals under an employment contract or similar arrangement between the entity and the covered individual. Examples of situations within the scope of proposed 6.6(d) are as follows:  A community health center deemed to be a covered entity establishes a school-based or school-linked health program as part of its grant supported activity. Even though the students treated are not necessarily registered patients of the center, the center and its health care practitioners will be covered for services provided, if the Secretary makes the determination in subparagraph (1).  A migrant health center requires its physicians to obtain staff privileges at a community hospital. As a condition of obtaining such privileges, and thus being able to admit the center's patients to the hospital, the physicians must agree to provide occasional coverage of the hospital's emergency room. The Secretary would be authorized to determine that this coverage is necessary to facilitate the provision of services to the grantee's patients, and that it would therefore be covered by subparagraph (2).  A homeless health services grantee makes arrangements with local community providers for after-hours coverage of its patients. The grantee's physicians are required by their employment contracts to provide periodic cross-coverage for patients of these providers, in order to make this arrangement feasible. The Secretary may determine that the arrangement is within the scope of subparagraph (3). Again, however, it should be understood that this would not extend the scope of coverage under Pub. L. 102501 to ``moonlighting'' activities by center health care practitioners.  This proposed rule is not intended to constitute, and does not constitute, a comprehensive notice pertaining to any provision of Pub. L. 102501 except to the extent that procedures pertaining to implementation of Pub. L. 102501 are described explicitly above. The applicability of Pub. L. 102501 and 42 U.S.C. 233(a) to a particular claim or case will depend upon the determination or certification (as appropriate) by the Attorney General that the individual or entity is covered by Pub. L. 102501 and was acting within the scope of employment, in accordance with normal Department of Justice procedures. A determination or certification by the Attorney General is subject to judicial review.      Economic Impact      Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, of costs, benefits, incentives, equity, and availability of information. Regulations which are ``significant'' because of cost, adverse effects on the economy, inconsistency with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues, require special analysis. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires that we include an analysis of all rules the significantly impact small businesses.  These proposed regulations provide information whereby health care entities or individual scan determine when, and to what extent they are likely to be protected for medical malpractice under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). Therefore, the Secretary certifies that the proposed regulations will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities.

Praise be to God, who said in the Holy Koran: And hold fast,  all together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and  be not divided among yourselves. Blessings and prayers of God  on His Prophet Muhammad, his household, and companions.    The House of Representatives, the legitimate representative  of all people of the united Yemen and the voice of their will,  [words indistinct] the national responsibility it shoulders, and  out of its understanding of the threats (?facing the country)  these days has broken off its holiday [words indistinct] on 17  Dhi al-Hijjah 1414 hegira, corresponding to 28 May 1994 to  discuss the (?criminal) act committed by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and  his secessionist gang against the country's unity, sovereignty,  and stability by declaring secession on 21 May 1994.    In view of the seriousness of this act, which is considered  high treason and a violation of the Constitution and an  infringement on the Republic of Yemen's sovereignty,  independence, and territorial integrity, the people's deputies  discussed this treacherous act from all Constitutional, legal,  and political aspects in the light of the Constitution and the  valid laws and the country's higher national interests.    Based on these discussions and the constitutional and legal  texts, the House of Representatives decides the following:    1. (?To condemn) al-Bid's declaration of secession as a  violation of the Constitution and all valid laws in the Republic  of Yemen.    2. The House considers this declaration not only a rebellion  against legitimacy, but also a flagrant encroachment against the  will of the Yemeni people and their unity, independence,  sovereignty, security and stability. All unionist and  democratic forces, as well as all citizens, must stand against  this act and confront it through all means since it is a  criminal act, which calls for bringing al-Bid and those who  supported him to trial on charges of high treason on the basis  of the Constitution and the valid laws.    3. The House of Representatives, as a legislative body,  represents all the people and adopts its decisions by majority  at official meetings and in accordance with the Constitution and  its bylaws. No deputy or group of deputies has the right to  hold a meeting or adopt a decision outside its headquarters and  away from its speakership. This indicates that what these  elements had done is null and void. These elements alleged that  they represent the Yemeni Socialist Party bloc, and they  approved al-Bid's secessionist declaration. Their action  represented an aggression against the unity, independence, and  territorial integrity of Yemen.    4. The House of Representatives urges all sisterly and  friendly countries to respect their positions and commitments  toward the Republic of Yemen as an independent sovereign state  that is an Arab League and UN member, and not to interfere in  its affairs, because what is going on is an internal affair in  which no country has the right to interfere, in accordance with  the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, the Arab League  Charter, and international charters.    The House emphasizes that any interference by any country or  any regional or international organization represents a  dangerous sign that will prolong strife and shift it from the  Yemeni horizon to the Arab and international horizons. This  will also open the way for renegade movements in a number of  countries, and will widen differences among the countries  involved in this interference.    The House of Representatives appreciates the heroic  positions  of the Armed Forces which protect unity and legitimacy. We pray  Almighty God to grant these forces success, and we urge all sons  of the Yemeni people to support the Armed Forces in order to  protect unity and legitimacy by all material and moral means.    The House urges the soldiers, noncommissioned officers, and  officers who are subjected to the orders of the secessionist  clique to join the army of unity and legitimacy in order to  preserve the peoples' respect for them, and to protect their  militant assets.    We seek God's support, and peace be upon you.    [Signed] The House of Representatives on 18 Dhu al-Hijjah,  1414 Hegira, corresponding to 29 May 1994     "

0,FT921-3013 ,"FT921-3013 _AN-CCQBDABKFT 920317   FT  17 MAR 92 / Letter: Where power lies in business      From Mr DAVID FIFIELD   Sir, I would like to add a few thoughts to Christopher Lorenz's article 'Sum total adds up to more than figures' (March 6) and Peter McGregor's letter (March 9). One has to ask how accountants have achieved their power within the UK business world. This I believe can be traced to the importance of the stock market in corporate ownership, with power delegated to senior managers. The accountant in this scenario acts as a policeman working on behalf of the owners. Having realised this situation the accountants have then organised the best closed shop. If we consider the long-term as practised in Germany and Japan we find ownership more closely involved in management and able to see financial conditions for itself. Under this arrangement creativity and evolutionary product design come to the fore. Interestingly, creativity as represented by intuition and measured by psychometric assessment is found more among scientists than accountants. I write as one educated as a scientist who chose a business career, passed through business school and later looked after the financial affairs of a group of companies.

They separate from  current post modern objects intended to remind us that traditional art is dead.  On the contrary, Bosslet enlivens industrial detritus by subjecting it to the  rules of classical geometric art.    Bosslet arranges old file cabinet drawers so that they form three-dimensional  rectangles. Bits of blond raw wood act as physical and visual buffers between  drawers, tacky yellow industrial paint on facings acts as colored accents, and  mechanical grooves cast in the metal become pure pictorial devices. Held  together by flat metal strapping laced around drawers in equidistant bands, the  structures form Mondrian arrangements executed with a cultivated sensitivity to  chromatic and structural weights and balances.    He also composes tightly ordered, site specific ""towers"" that extend from the  gallery floor to the ceiling rafters via long metal tubes set on rough hewn  brick bases. Aping the look of weight bearing architecture, dotted with fake  bolts and fittings meticulously staged but having no function, the towers  address the myth of the machine, and force our awareness of the space they  occupy.    Bosslet's queer objects never escape superficial associations with totems,  sacred covenant arcs, secret maps, but at their core is a deeper interest in  the concept of ordered work in all its manifestations.

MARLENA  DONOHUE      Column; Art Review    "," LA120889-0034   145422    December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition      Calendar; Part F; Page 19; Column 3; Entertainment Desk      302 words      THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA      By MARLENA DONOHUE      The German sculptor Eberhard Bosslet makes works from unaltered industrial  materials arranged with elegance and conceptual complexity. They separate from  current post modern objects intended to remind us that traditional art is dead.  On the contrary, Bosslet enlivens industrial detritus by subjecting it to the  rules of classical geometric art.    Bosslet arranges old file cabinet drawers so that they form three-dimensional  rectangles. Bits of blond raw wood act as physical and visual buffers between  drawers, tacky yellow industrial paint on facings acts as colored accents, and  mechanical grooves cast in the metal become pure pictorial devices. Held  together by flat metal strapping laced around drawers in equidistant bands, the  structures form Mondrian arrangements executed with a cultivated sensitivity to  chromatic and structural weights and balances.    He also composes tightly ordered, site specific ""towers"" that extend from the  gallery floor to the ceiling rafters via long metal tubes set on rough hewn  brick bases. Aping the look of weight bearing architecture, dotted with fake  bolts and fittings meticulously staged but having no function, the towers  address the myth of the machine, and force our awareness of the space they  occupy.    Bosslet's queer objects never escape superficial associations with totems,  sacred covenant arcs, secret maps, but at their core is a deeper interest in  the concept of ordered work in all its manifestations. Brick and metal suggest  the step by step drudgery of physical labor; file cabinets suggest bureaucratic  labor; while the labor of making art, Bosslet seems to say, involves literally  ""pulling apart"" the everyday and rearranging its components into some higher  order of information.

This raid is part of a series of criminal actions carried out  by this traitorous gang against economic and civilian  installations and targets in our country that began with the  firing of Scud missiles at defenseless civilians in Sanaa,  Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Zinjibar, and (al-Rahidah), and includes  the shelling of vital installations in Aden, led by the Aden  refinery and the power generating station in al-Hiswah.

The man with the face like a cooked ham is a British public relations adviser who used to work for Mrs Margaret Thatcher, her British former counterpart. Another adviser is on the phone to Elle magazine in Germany about the possibility of doing a cover story during Mrs Tansu Ciller's trip to Bonn. Unfortunately, Mrs Ciller's policy achievements have often failed to match the aplomb of her public relations. She is certainly not the 'agent of change' that one western ambassador suggested. But for all her lack of experience, she has a strong instinct for survival. Her party's narrow victory in local polls on March 27 is largely put down to her popularity. The man on the street says that she should be given the benefit of the doubt. It is hard to find a shopkeeper who blames her for the economic mess - though that is not the view in the boardrooms and banking halls of Istanbul. Mrs Ciller is a walking contradiction. A successful, independently wealthy woman in a male-dominated, Moslem society, she seems equally at home donning the headscarf in deference to Islam or a football scarf in support of the soccer team Galatasaray's short-lived but heroic run in the European Cup. Her rise to power owes much to the patronage of Mr Suleyman Demirel, the former prime minister, whose election to the presidency paved the way for Mrs Ciller's leadership victory. Mr Demirel was reportedly impressed by her robust criticisms of the late Turgut Ozal, then Motherland party prime minister, when she worked for Tusiad, the businessmen's association. During the election campaign of 1990, Mrs Ciller was frequently photographed on Mr Demirel's right hand. It worked for the six-times prime minister. His True Path party won the election, though without an outright majority. What perhaps he did not count on was having to give Mrs Ciller a senior cabinet position. After more than 10 months in office, Mrs Ciller's hold on power is still something of a mystery. Her impetuous management style has shaken the crusty bureaucrats in Ankara. The casualty list is impressive - two central bank governors have resigned since she became prime minister. The former head of the state planning organisation has become one of her most virulent public critics. Her victory in the True Path party congress in June 1993 over Mrs Ismet Sezgin, nominally the choice of Mr Demirel, is largely unexplained. She seemed genuinely puzzled when asked during the campaign how many party MPs could be relied on to vote for her. One senior DYP figure says none of the cabinet supported her candidacy. Mrs Ciller, a 48-year-old former Istanbul economics professor, is in many ways a political 'naif'. The Turkish press has been kind. Despite rumours about her husband's irregular business dealings - particularly about the collapse in the 1980s of the Istanbul Bank, of which he was a director - there seems to be no Whitewater waiting to engulf the prime minister. Cynics point out that Mrs Ciller helped the newspapers financially with generous tax breaks and investment incentives just before the leadership challenge. Her economic policies will continue to be under close scrutiny, but her political ideas remain obscure. Her strong line on the Kurds clearly served her well in the local elections. Indeed, one of the most lasting impressions of her administration has been the way she has accommodated the military - in the fight against the Kurds and in the more parochial matter of pay rises for the armed forces and the extension of the service of General Dogan Gures, the chief of general staff. Gen Gures was among the first of the public figures to applaud Mrs Ciller's recently unveiled austerity package.   Countries:-  TRZ  Turkey, Middle East.

('Late accounts levies expected to hit 15 per cent of UK companies', April 22) Although this particular failure to apply company law is at last being rectified by the imposition of automatic levies on defaulters, the reluctance of the Department of Trade and Industry to apply the law does not stop there, since Companies House shows little vigilance in monitoring whether the content of the accounts it receives comply with company law. Companies House only acts after the horse has bolted, usually when a company has actually failed and creditors face substantial losses. The amount of money that innocent creditors could be saved by effective supervision of company law is positively mind boggling. The shortcomings of the DTI in overseeing company law have reached legendary status. It is time that the job was handed over to the police.

John Pizzini, 30, of Costa Mesa, who pleaded guilty to four counts of child  molestation earlier this year, was released from jail in October after serving  a three-month sentence.    He was placed on three years' probation, which required him to register with  police as a sex offender and stay away from minors.    Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Shade said she had been informed that Pizzini was  hiring children ages 10 and older to go door to door and sell candy for  Pizzini's Youth Enterprise Program.    Although a former business operated by Pizzini had a different name, it is the  same type of operation that got him into trouble before, Shade said.    ""I've called his probation officer and we're are going to investigate the  matter,"" Shade said, adding that she has received calls from parents who  expressed concern about Pizzini's activities.    Pizzini could not be reached for comment.    Officials with the county probation office, as a matter of policy, declined to  discuss Pizzini's case.    Pizzini was arrested in July by Costa Mesa police and charged with four  misdemeanor counts of lewd acts with a child. The victim was a 14-year-old  girl.    Pizzini, dubbed ""the Candy Man"" by local law enforcement officials, reportedly  wanted to marry the girl but was stopped by authorities, who ordered that she  be sent to a shelter for abused and neglected children. The victim was then  released into the care of her father, Shade said.

The rally was attended by Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of  the PFLP-GC; Dr. 'Ala'-al-Din 'Abdin, secretary of the Damascus  Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party; Staff Brigadier  General Tariq al-Khadra', chief of staff of the Palestinian  Liberation Army [PLA]; leaders of the Palestinian Forces  Alliance; leaders and representatives of patriotic parties in  Lebanon; leaders and representatives of the National Progressive  Front in Syria; a number of ranking PLA officers;  representatives of Arab and friendly liberation movements;  members of the Arab and friendly diplomatic corps; relatives of  the martyrs and prisoners; and members of the PFLP-GC's  Political Bureau and Central Committee. [passage omitted]    PFLP-GC Secretary General Ahmad Jibril delivered the speech  of the Palestinian revolution and the PFLP-GC. He began his  speech by asking: How far have we reached and when will we get  there? He said: It is the right of our people and the martyrs  of our revolution and front to ask: How far have we come, and  what have we accomplished throughout this long militant march.    He added: From the very beginning, since 1959, we have laid  the first stones of the armed struggle. We have said the road  to the liberation of Palestine is difficult and long and the  battle against the Zionist enemy is an open one because we are  not just fighting a Zionist group, but are fighting colonialism  and its agents, represented by reactionary Arab regimes and the  renegades and deviants in the PLO leadership.    Jibril touched on the issue of independent Palestinian  decisionmaking and said: Those who have called for this want to  separate the national cause of the Palestinian people from the  pan-Arab cause in order to reach what they have now reached.  The deviations that have occurred, the last of which the Oslo  Accord, are the natural outcome of this idea, which is aimed at  isolating the Palestine question from pan-Arabism. He described  those who have called for independent Palestinian decisionmaking  as the owners of the separatist veto in the Palestinian  community. He said: The real Palestinian decisionmaking is the  decisionmaking of the Arab and Islamic nation and the Muslim  Arab people. [passage omitted]    Ahmad Jibril dealt with the current political situation and  strongly criticized the visit to Oman and Qatar by the Zionist  delegation led by Zionist Deputy Foreign Minister [Yosi] Beilin.  He said: The enemy's penetration into reactionary Arab regimes  is not new. This time, however, it not only aims to achieve  public and direct normalization but also to find new cards to  pressure the forces hostile to the settlement and to give the  Tunis leadership and 'Arafat a new dose of strength now that  they have become exposed and fragile before Arab and Palestinian  public opinion. He said: The Zionist political course at this  stage aims at dissolving the unified Arab position in order to  force Syria and Lebanon to accept what Clinton and the others  seek.    Ahmad Jibril says: Today, there is a current called peace  that has its own way to reach agreements -- in Oslo, Washington,  Muscat, and tomorrow Bahrain.    Jibril says: The 'Arafat-Rabin agreement has been concluded  in two files -- security and economy. He noted that the  security file calls for stopping and ending the intifadah  through 'Arafat's police now that the Zionists have failed in  confronting the intifadah. He said that 'Arafat's task is now  to go to Gaza and Jericho to foil and destroy the intifadah  instead of the Zionists. The Zionists aim at infiltrating the  Arab world through the economic file.    Jibril says: If the Zionists and 'Arafat succeed in stopping  the intifadah, it means opening the door wide open for  Jewish-Zionist immigration into Palestine, reinforcing Zionist  settlements in Palestine, and imposing a siege on the  Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.    Ahmad Jibril said that the heroic intifadah has aborted the  schemes of 'Arafat and Rabin and will continue to resist them.    In his speech Jibril praised the firm and solid stands of  Syria, Libya, and Iran.     "

The strike was also a message to other  fugitive terrorists, warning them that any acts they might  commit are doomed to fail, especially in light of the prevailing  national unity and the complete popular support for the security  agencies and all their actions.    This preemptive strike is the fourth of its kind to take  place in the center of a heavily populated poor neighborhood, in  which no citizen or policeman was hit.    The first blow was the arrest of nine terrorists who carried  out the failed attempt to assassinate the prime minister on 25  November, during which not a single shot was fired. They are  currently being tried by a military tribunal.    The second blow was in the al-Ma'sarah incident during  security sweeps in the area where two terrorists were killed and  two others, one of whom was a Palestinian, were arrested. In  this incident a dangerous terrorist named Tharwat Hajjaj managed  to escape, only to meet his death yesterday along with two  others in a clash in the al-Sayyidah Zaynab neighborhood.    The third blow was delivered in the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra'  area  late in January against terrorist hideouts, in which seven  dangerous terrorists, known as the Asyut group, were killed and  no civilians or security men were hit.

One grenade was aimed at two vehicles belonging to the  minister and his supporters and another at a minibus belonging  to one of the minister's supporters.    Talking to a Kampala Radio Uganda Network reporter by  telephone from Mbale, Mr. Rwigyemera assured the people of Mbale  and the entire country that government authorities in Mbale have  zeroed on those reactionaries and security precautions have  [been] maximally undertaken to ensure that such acts of thuggery  do not occur again, and that elections are not disrupted at all.    He disclosed that they are aware that the target area for  the  thugs are Mbale municipality, Bubulo east and west  constituencies and Manjiya County. He said the cause of these  is that the reactionaries have realized that they are in for a  shock on Monday [28 March, contrary to the fallacy that Bugisu  and eastern Uganda are their power base. He said that the thugs  have also realized that the people can no longer be manipulated.    The central government representative expressed condolence  to  the relatives of the young man who was killed in the attack. He  also expressed sympathy to the relatives of those who were  injured.     "

More than 50 people  were wounded in the explosion. Five people who were gravely  wounded were transferred to the Rambam Hospital in Haifa, where  one of them died of her wounds. Another four wounded are  currently being transferred to the Tel Hashomer Hospital. Eight  of the wounded were released; 33 people were hospitalized in the  'Afula Hospital with light to moderate injuries.    Police Minister Shahal and Police Commissioner Peled arrived  at the scene. Minister Shahal said that since the Hebron  massacre the Police feared Arab terrorist attacks, and several  attacks were indeed foiled. Commissioner Peled said that it is  possible that as of tomorrow no vehicles from the territories  will be allowed entrance into the Green Line, because it is  inconceivable that Israel would allow inhabitants of the  territories to enter the Green Line to carry out attacks. The  issue of the closure will also be reassessed. The commissioner  added that the timing of the attack -- 40 days after the Hebron  massacre -- did not surprise the police, which were recently  reinforced along the Green Line and in Jerusalem.    Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that the car used for  the explosion was stolen from the Tel Aviv area. Migdal Ha'emeq  [a town near 'Afula] residents have started to congregate en  masse, and the police are acting to prevent acts of revenge.     "
