By IVANA STEPANKOVA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The United States risks losing an unusual opportunity to assert global  leadership in protecting Antarctica, Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) said Thursday  on the eve of an international conference on the future of the frozen  continent.    Gore spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Alliance for Antarctica, a  coalition of environmental groups. It is calling on the United States and other  nations participating in the conference, which begins Monday in Chile, to  designate Antarctica as a world science park.    Rep. Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on  parks and public land, said he fears that recurring degradation has made  Antarctica ""an environmental time bomb ready to explode.""    ""We have no time for half-measures if America is to be the world's leader in  protecting Antarctica,"" Vento said.    Congressional legislation calling for preservation of Antarctica is awaiting  President Bush's signature, but there has been speculation that the Interior  Department might urge Bush to veto the measure. The legislation for the first  time would apply U.S. environmental protection laws to any activity in  Antarctica sponsored by an agency of the U.S. government. It also would  prohibit U.S. exploration or development of minerals in Antarctica.    The United States ""should be leading the way and trying to protect the island  instead of trying to protect the mineral convention,"" said Rep. Wayne Owens  (D-Utah), who introduced the measure in the House. Gore was its Senate sponsor.    The focus of a dispute between Congress and the State Department is the  ratification of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources  Activities, on which the State Department has worked for six years.    The convention, signed two years ago but not ratified by 17 of 20 nations,  would regulate mineral exploration but not ban it, as the congressional action  would. The French and Australian governments are now against the accord, saying  that no international agreement that would endorse even strictly regulated  exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources could be acceptable to either  government. If all 20 nations do not ratify the pact, it is dead.    Mining in the Antarctic is not compatible with the protection of the  continent's fragile environment, many environmentalists contend. French  oceanologist Jacques Cousteau, in an interview with the New York Times last  year, declared that an oil spill in the Antarctic could damage the food chain  for decades and affect the entire hemisphere.    But Tucker Scully, director of the office of ocean affairs at the State  Department and the lead U.S. negotiator for Antarctic issues, disagreed with  the hands-off approach to the continent. ""Creating a world park is to stick  one's head in the sand,"" he said.    According to environmentalists, Antarctica is being marred by air pollution and  tourist ships and threatened by mining. They also believe that the continent is  being damaged by scientists who come to unlock its mysteries. They burn their  garbage in pits and dump their junk in a landfill by the sea, they charge.    ""We treated Antarctica like a frontier town,"" said R. N. Andersen, the National  Science Foundation's deputy general counsel. Congress has funded a five-year,  $30-million program to clean up the Antarctic environment. More than 76  scientific projects are now under way on the continent.    During the peak summer months, about 4,000 people inhabit Antarctica, and  tourism is increasing rapidly. Last year, about 3,000 people paid more than  $10,000 each to photograph penguins and view the vast sweeps of ice and rock.

Mr Ashdown wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, saying he had seen the British proposal which was circulated to other Antarctic treaty parties before their meeting in Madrid next week, but which was not given to MPs. He said the document showed that Britain intended actively to promote a mining regime at the conference. Greenpeace is pressing for the continent to become an international nature reserve. Lord Melchett, director of Greenpeace, protested that UK policy would mean a moratorium on mining for a fixed term, probably 20 years, to be followed by a minerals agreement.

The reason this is not supported by Greenpeace, or any of the Antarctic Treaty nations which met in Madrid, is because mineral extraction would not be possible without irreversible environmental damage to this unique region. Accidents will always happen, as the history of oil exploration makes very clear, and as the oil companies themselves would admit. We welcome the fact that international co-operation between 39 countries, based on the precautionary principle, has secured Antarctica's future for at least 50 years, and hopefully for much longer.

The fusion achieved between former East and  West German polar researchers caused less of a sensation.    Polar researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar  and Oceanic Research Bremerhaven made out well during ""ceiling  control,"" which in plain English means last year's freeze on  national research institute budgets by the BMFT (Federal  Ministry for Research and Technology). Mention of their  participation in the international Global Change Program, which  is aimed at studying global environmental change, protected them  from the red pencil.    The Germans can make a traditionally significant  contribution  to tracking down global changes, especially in the Antarctic. In  1976, GDR researchers set up their own research station to study  solar-terrestrial relationships in the Schirmacher Oasis in  Queen Maud Land, which later was given the name ""Georg Forster.""  After the conclusions of this program, isotope physicists and  chemists from Leipzig, geologists from Potsdam, and  geomagnetists moved in.    The first Federal German station, ""Georg von Neumayer,"" was  built in 1981. With the German-German fusion of polar research,  the question arose whether and how operation of the stations  should be continued. Result: ""Forster"" is being renovated, but  in the future it will only be used as a summer base. The budget  afforded no more, especially since the old Neumayer station on  the Ekstrom shelf ice in western Antarctica had to be given up  and replaced by new facilities in 1992.    What too seldom works out in other cases went well here.  East  German polar research was given an exceptionally positive  assessment by the Science Council. AWI director Prof. Gotthilf  Hempel, chairman of the evaluation committee, even raved about  ""a pearl of former GDR Academy research."" There was no  duplication of West German goals. Structurally, of course, there  were adjustment problems. Earlier, a maximum of six staff  members of the Academy's Central Institute for Geophysics in  Potsdam prepared and coordinated the expeditions logistically.  Scientists from various institutions carried out the research  itself. After unification, it was decided to expand the Potsdam  working group to an AWI research center. The staff was increased  to 40, 20 of whom are scientists.    Corresponding to the marine specialization of the AWI parent  institute, continental activities went to the Potsdam group. In  addition, atmospheric research using radio-equipped weather  balloon ascents, radiation measurements, ozone exploration with  lasers, and spectroscopic detection of aerosols are increasingly  being undertaken. One group of the Bremerhaven scientists  involved with this area has moved to Brandenburg. ""Certainly the  long tradition of East German research on the Antarctic  atmosphere influenced this decision favorably,"" believes  research center director Dr. Hans-Wolfgang Hubberten. GDR  scientists, he acknowledges, ""were the first to measure the  vertical structure of the ozone hole continuously with balloon  probes."" This longest and most complete series of measurements  will be continued in the future at the Neumayer station. ""But  aerological investigations as well as total ozone measurements  on Spitzbergen will be made and evaluated by us,"" says  Hubberten. His goal: To maintain the good image of the Potsdam  research center and to polish it up with new ideas and findings.     "

0,FT942-7081 ,"FT942-7081 _AN-EE0DLAA4FT 940527   FT  27 MAY 94 / Sanctuary for whales in Antarctica agreed      By DAMIAN FRASER      PUERTO VALLARTA   The International Whaling Commission yesterday approved a whale sanctuary around Antarctica that will protect the vast majority of the world's whales from commercial hunting for the indefinite future. The sanctuary will stretch from Antarctica to between 40 and 60 degrees south of the equator. It was first proposed by France two years ago, and after modifications, was backed by the necessary three-quarters of countries in the Whaling Commission. Japan had led opposition to the plan. There were 23 votes in favour, one vote against (Japan) and six abstentions, including Norway. 'Today is a great day for people who love whales and above all for the whales themselves,' said Mr Homero Aridjis, head of Grupo de los Cien, an environmental group in Mexico. Initially the sanctuary will have only a symbolic impact, since commercial whale hunting is currently prohibited by an international moratorium. However environmentalists worry that the International Whaling Commission may eventually replace the moratorium with hunting quotas for whales that are not in short supply. If adopted, quotas would have let Japan kill an estimated 2,000 minke whales a year in the Antarctic region. Antarctica is home to some 760,000 minke whales, the only whales of commercial interest in the ocean. Japan has argued that since minke whales are not endangered, there is no scientific justification for a blanket sanctuary. The sanctuary could conceivably make the lifting of the moratorium easier, since whaling countries can now argue that the vast majority of whales will be protected from hunters. Japan would like to hunt for minke whales off its coast, while Norway, in defiance of the moratorium, has already resumed commercial minke whaling off its shores.   Countries:-  AQZ  Antarctica.

About 13,000 miles and  four months later, he turned off the freeway in San Diego and fell in love with  the warm climate and postcard-perfect beaches. It took him another year to find  out he could turn his passion for travel into a paying job. Now a free-lance  writer specializing in adventure travel, he authors articles and books,  including one on his favorite corners of the Earth and another about Americans  as others see us. Simmons, a Pacific Beach resident, was interviewed by Times  Staff writer G. Jeanette Avent and photographed by Vince Compagnone.     While I was teaching, I had been doing a lot of traveling on my own, but it  was a real different kind of traveling from what I do now. I'd spend three  months traveling through Asia by myself. It was pretty solitary, which was  fine. But, once I started doing adventure travel with naturalists along, I was  hooked. You get into a group of people with shared interests and it becomes a  traveling seminar.    In 1974, I did the best trip I've ever done, a 30-day cruise to Antarctica  which was real frontier at that time. There were about 80 of us on board,  including six naturalists and Roger Tory Peterson, the No. 1 name in  ornithology. We spent five days doing the first tourist exploration of South  Georgia Island, which had been the center of the Antarctic whaling industry.  That was all closed down, but everything was intact. You'd walk up to the dock,  and all the whaling vessels were there with their big harpoon guns. There was  the chart room, the dining room china, the galley. Sitting out in a mud bank  was a well preserved, Norwegian three-masted whaling vessel from 1885. You'd go  into the movie house, and the walls were all lined with posters advertising  Randolph Scott Westerns from the '30s and a Gary Cooper film from 1943.    We had some good weather, and we went south where the pack ice had split up. We  went into areas where there were no docks and you had to go over the side of  the ship in Zodiacs, which are small, 16-foot inflatable motorboats. Antarctica  is so splendid. It has one of the great profusions of wildlife in the world. It  has penguin rookeries where there are 2 million birds. There are no predators  on land in Antarctica so you can walk right up and practically touch a penguin.  It boggles the mind.    I suppose the most dangerous trip was the one down the Omo River in  southwestern Ethiopia. We had a hippo attack on the boat. The Omo was the last  pocket of territory to be explored by Westerners. I went in 1975 on the first  commercial expedition, and the first natives we saw had never seen Westerners.  It was Africa the way it was 150 years ago.    We were 25 days on the river and covered about 300 miles. For the first half,  we were at the bottom of a canyon at 4,000 feet, which had some splendid  scenery and excellent white water. The second half was savannah country, and  that's where the people were. The trip was wonderful but what made it dangerous  is the difference between African river running and American river running. If  you flip over in a raft at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, you know exactly  what to do. You have your life jacket on, and you go into the rapids feet first  and you come out. In Africa, when you come out in the calm water, you've got  the crocodiles to contend with.    We never had a boat flip, but you always knew if something happened, it'd be  you and the crocodiles. They're big ones, 18 to 20 feet long, and we'd see six  or eight of them at a time lying on the bank. We had these croc rocks so when  the crocodiles came close to the boat we were supposed to shout obscenities and  throw these croc rocks. That was a requirement.    At the time of the hippo attack, we were going through a place on the river  called hippo alley where as many as 500 to 600 hippos have been counted passing  through during the day. What hippos do in the heat of the day is walk on the  bottom of the river. They come up every five minutes for air and then go back  down. You have to be careful to stay in shallow water so you don't have hippos  coming up underneath you. One of our boatmen got careless and wasn't in shallow  water, and a hippo surfaced right along side of the boat. The hippo panicked.  These enormous jaws opened and he bit down on the boat. He just missed a  passenger by a foot. It was over in two seconds, and then the hippo was gone.  We had to go ashore and fix the pontoon. We just all thought it was a great  adventure.    In March, I spent my birthday on Pitcairn Island where the Bounty mutineers  ended up in 1790. Pitcairn celebrated its 200th anniversary this year. We were  the first cruise boat to stay overnight. It was interesting seeing Pitcairn  through Pitcairn eyes. At the top of a hill was a house, so we asked them about  that. That's our vacation house, they said.

About 13,000 miles and  four months later, he turned off the freeway in San Diego and fell in love with  the warm climate and postcard-perfect beaches. It took him another year to find  out he could turn his passion for travel into a paying job. Now a free-lance  writer specializing in adventure travel, he authors articles and books,  including one on his favorite corners of the Earth and another about Americans  as others see us. Simmons, a Pacific Beach resident, was interviewed by Times  Staff writer G. Jeanette Avent and photographed by Vince Compagnone.     While I was teaching, I had been doing a lot of traveling on my own, but it  was a real different kind of traveling from what I do now. I'd spend three  months traveling through Asia by myself. It was pretty solitary, which was  fine. But, once I started doing adventure travel with naturalists along, I was  hooked. You get into a group of people with shared interests and it becomes a  traveling seminar.    In 1974, I did the best trip I've ever done, a 30-day cruise to Antarctica  which was real frontier at that time. There were about 80 of us on board,  including six naturalists and Roger Tory Peterson, the No. 1 name in  ornithology. We spent five days doing the first tourist exploration of South  Georgia Island, which had been the center of the Antarctic whaling industry.  That was all closed down, but everything was intact. You'd walk up to the dock,  and all the whaling vessels were there with their big harpoon guns. There was  the chart room, the dining room china, the galley. Sitting out in a mud bank  was a well preserved, Norwegian three-masted whaling vessel from 1885. You'd go  into the movie house, and the walls were all lined with posters advertising  Randolph Scott Westerns from the '30s and a Gary Cooper film from 1943.    We had some good weather, and we went south where the pack ice had split up. We  went into areas where there were no docks and you had to go over the side of  the ship in Zodiacs, which are small, 16-foot inflatable motorboats. Antarctica  is so splendid. It has one of the great profusions of wildlife in the world. It  has penguin rookeries where there are 2 million birds. There are no predators  on land in Antarctica so you can walk right up and practically touch a penguin.  It boggles the mind.    I suppose the most dangerous trip was the one down the Omo River in  southwestern Ethiopia. We had a hippo attack on the boat. The Omo was the last  pocket of territory to be explored by Westerners. I went in 1975 on the first  commercial expedition, and the first natives we saw had never seen Westerners.  It was Africa the way it was 150 years ago.    We were 25 days on the river and covered about 300 miles. For the first half,  we were at the bottom of a canyon at 4,000 feet, which had some splendid  scenery and excellent white water. The second half was savannah country, and  that's where the people were. The trip was wonderful but what made it dangerous  is the difference between African river running and American river running. If  you flip over in a raft at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, you know exactly  what to do. You have your life jacket on, and you go into the rapids feet first  and you come out. In Africa, when you come out in the calm water, you've got  the crocodiles to contend with.    We never had a boat flip, but you always knew if something happened, it'd be  you and the crocodiles. They're big ones, 18 to 20 feet long, and we'd see six  or eight of them at a time lying on the bank. We had these croc rocks so when  the crocodiles came close to the boat we were supposed to shout obscenities and  throw these croc rocks. That was a requirement.    At the time of the hippo attack, we were going through a place on the river  called hippo alley where as many as 500 to 600 hippos have been counted passing  through during the day. What hippos do in the heat of the day is walk on the  bottom of the river. They come up every five minutes for air and then go back  down. You have to be careful to stay in shallow water so you don't have hippos  coming up underneath you. One of our boatmen got careless and wasn't in shallow  water, and a hippo surfaced right along side of the boat. The hippo panicked.  These enormous jaws opened and he bit down on the boat. He just missed a  passenger by a foot. It was over in two seconds, and then the hippo was gone.  We had to go ashore and fix the pontoon. We just all thought it was a great  adventure.    In March, I spent my birthday on Pitcairn Island where the Bounty mutineers  ended up in 1790. Pitcairn celebrated its 200th anniversary this year. We were  the first cruise boat to stay overnight. It was interesting seeing Pitcairn  through Pitcairn eyes. At the top of a hill was a house, so we asked them about  that. That's our vacation house, they said. That's where we come when we want  to get away from the sound of the sea. It's fascinating because everywhere you  turn there's the ghost of the Bounty. In the town square there's an anchor from  the Bounty. In one of the houses, there's was a canon from the Bounty. The  Bible from the Bounty is in the church.

The regulations proposed by Britain and Australia urge  tourists, explorers and travel agencies to control their own  activities to protect the wildlife and environment of the  continent.    They will be formally adopted during the conference's final  sessions Thursday and Friday.    ""Do not feed, touch, or handle birds or seals,"" ""do not  damage plants,"" and ""do not use guns or explosives,"" are among  the draft's guidelines urging visitors to refrain from  activities that disturb the Antarctic flora and fauna.    Tourists and adventurers are also asked to respect protected  areas, to stay away from research facilities and study sites,  not to dispose waste or collect rocks and fossils as souvenirs,  and to plan their trips sensibly.    The draft obligates tour organizers to notify national  authorities about planned activities, assess and monitor the  environmental impact of their expeditions and employ experienced  and trained guides.    Travel agents must inform tour participants about the  requirements of the 1959 Antarctic treaty and its follow-up  provisions and educate them about proper behavior in Antarctica.    Delegates could not reach a consensus on how the guidelines  should be implemented by national governments but decided to  discuss national solutions at the coming Antarctica conference  in South Korea next year.    Restrictions on tourism have become a hot potato among  treaty  signatories since the adoption of the protocol on environmental  protection to the Antarctic treaty in 1991.    Countries like the United States and Britain, from where  many  tourists visit the area, were opposed to tough regulations  involving liability for environmental damage as proposed by  France and Chile.    A major success of the Kyoto conference is that delegates  reached an agreement on the tourism issue at all. However, a  Japanese delegate decried that the guidelines were watered down  to minimum requirements.    ""Their content is characterized by the thinking `let's start  from the common ground for the time being,'"" the delegate said.    A U.S. delegate said the need for such guidelines on the  other hand shows ""how close the South Pole has moved to us.""    About 250 delegates from some 40 countries, international  organizations and nongovernmental groups are attending the  meeting which started April 11 and runs through Friday.    About 7,000 tourists including some 100 Japanese visit the  South Pole each year, but there have been reports of the  tourists trampling penguin nesting grounds, damaging local plant  life and disrupting scientific experiments being conducted in  the area.

0,FT911-4261 ,"FT911-4261 _AN-BDTALAARFT 910420   FT  20 APR 91 / Letter: Strong case for keeping options open on mining in Antarctica      From Mr ROBERT DAVIES   Sir, The apparent change in the British government's attitude towards mining in Antarctica is disappointing. That Australia and France (an unlikely combination if ever there was one) are pushing the issue for blatant domestic political reasons is well known. For Britain to follow their lead would be shameful. No one is actually arguing for full and immediate exploitation of resources in Antarctica but to deny ourselves the mechanism for doing so would be short-sighted. Perhaps just one example can be used to illustrate the case for keeping our options open. For many years North Americans have been concerned about pollution from car exhausts and have progressively reduced the amount of carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides (believed to be a factor in acid rain) that cars are allowed to emit. Europe is belatedly following. This trend is happening around the world. To achieve these standards car manufacturers rely on a device called an emission control catalyst that uses platinum group metals (PGMs) to convert these gases into less harmful carbon dioxide and nitrogen. PGMs are rare and are currently only mined in any quantity in South Africa and Russia. PGMs are also expensive. Platinum, the most common at Dollars 400 an ounce, is more expensive than gold, while rhodium, the most rare, is currently more than Dollars 5,000 an ounce. Rhodium is crucial in an autocatalyst because it is the only metal that can reduce nitrous oxides. Production problems and increased demand have caused the price of rhodium to jump from Dollars 1,600 an ounce a year ago to Dollars 7,000 last summer. Some observers say it could rise to Dollars 10,000 an ounce even with planned production increases to meet rising demand. But what has this to do with Antarctica? The answer is that PGMs are mostly found in geological features called layered ultramafic intrusions, such as the Bushveld of South Africa. However, an even larger one lies in Antarctica called the Dufek massif which coincidentally occurs in British Antarctic Territory. It has not so far been tested for PGMs. If ecologists get their way at the Madrid conference next month we will never know if the Dufek contains PGMs. Reform in South Africa and Russia is continuing but if the Dufek process is interrupted, or becomes unstable, our supply of PGMs, and rhodium in particular, could fall. It is worth remembering too that it is only two years since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigated this market. Autocatalysts, each of which use at least 1.5 grams of rhodium, could be threatened and the pace of emission control might slow rapidly, possibly increasing acid rain. Environmentalists flying or driving to Madrid, in metal cars and planes consuming fossil fuels, should contemplate whether they really want the world's most barren continent to be denied a potential role in improving the world's atmosphere. Should not my former employer, the British Antarctic Survey, give our diplomats a full briefing before the conference?

BUT THE PUSH IS ON TO PRESERVE THIS LAST UNTAINTED LABORATORY.      By JAMES F. SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER      ANVERS ISLAND, Antarctica      The upturned hull of a sunken Argentine tourist ship has nearly slipped from  sight, barely breaking the surface now like one of the playful whales that swim  these frigid but plentiful waters.    Yet the somber memories of the wreck last year, and the oil it spilled within  sight of a premier U.S. research station, endure as forceful symbols of the  hazards posed by the growing human presence in Antarctica.    Although the 315 tourists and crew of the Bahia Paraiso survived and the spill  was minor by most standards, the accident gave new impetus to a movement to  respect this continent not only as a place of forbidding beauty but also as a  fragile reservoir ensuring the Earth's health.    That has meant, in part, cleaning up the unsightly mess that developed in  recent decades from Antarctic exploration itself. But more broadly, it has  encouraged a changing mentality toward tourism, research methods and  exploitation. The broken hulk also has reminded the world of the need to  preserve Antarctica as a uniquely shared and still-untainted laboratory for  understanding the planet's seas and skies.    The 25 nations that make up the Antarctic Treaty organization are working with  renewed energy on tougher rules to govern activities in the region. And some  countries are rebelling against an already strict 1988 agreement to govern oil  drilling and mineral mining, arguing instead for an outright ban.    The National Science Foundation, which runs the U.S. Antarctic program, is  removing the junk heaps that scar its three permanent bases and is hauling  shiploads of rubble back north. Even before the Bahia Paraiso sank, an  additional $8.3 million was budgeted for environmental and safety projects this  year. Cleaner sewer systems are being installed, environmental impact programs  are under review and emergency plans for oil spills are being drafted.    ""For years, Antarctica was approached in an expeditionary way,"" said Gary  Staffo, recently named as the National Science Foundation's polar safety and  environmental officer. ""It was seen as a one-time shot: 'We'll go do the  mission and get the people back and leave the trash behind.' Certainly that is  no longer acceptable -- and that is progress. There are greater expectations  now.""    Bahia Paraiso means Paradise Bay in Spanish, and that would have been an apt  name for the place where the ship foundered on rocks on Jan. 28, 1989, spilling  about 150,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the sea.    Elephant seals nuzzle noisily on a rocky island beach, adelie and chinstrap  penguins totter about, tiny limpets browse in the tidal basins and swarms of  shrimp-like krill bloom in springtime, hearty meals for the whales.    Across the bay, blue-white glacial ice cliffs rise hundreds of feet out of the  sea. The silence gives way to explosions as vast slabs break away and slide  into the water -- the ""calving"" of icebergs from the ice shelf that covers 98%  of the continent and is up to three miles thick near the South Pole.    Above all, Antarctica is a place for science. In recent years, the research has  taken on urgency as knowledge emerges of the environmental damage caused by  industrial-era pollution and its potential impact on the whole planet.    Other projects take advantage of the still-unspoiled seas and skies, with  constant winter nights and crystal summer days, to pursue cutting-edge studies  of phenomena such as cosmic rays and radiation belts.    And some scientists are finding a world startlingly abloom in what seems at  first such a bleak and lifeless place, fresh proof of the continent's crucial  role in the world's ecology.    Researchers David Karl of the University of Hawaii and Mark Huntley of the  Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, for example, are charting a  phenomenal mass of life in the Gerlache Strait along the Antarctic Peninsula.    From the pitching deck of the primary U.S. research ship the Polar Duke, Karl  sends an electronic pulse into the water, setting off a small explosion. That  frees a titanium frame holding a ring of 13 plastic bottles, and the device  floats up hundreds of feet to the surface.    All hands scan the choppy waters until Robert H. Rutford, president of the  University of Texas at Dallas and a veteran polar hand, spies the yellow buoys  astern. The ship's winch painstakingly recovers the experiment. Karl helps pull  aboard the frame and its harvest: five months' worth of organic sediment, much  of it excrement from luxuriant swarms of krill shellfish.    The ""catch"" is neatly divided into 11-day samples captured by the  computer-driven ring of revolving bottles attached to the bottom of a plastic  funnel. Some are near empty, but a couple, recording the height of the ""bloom,""  are nearly full.    The six-year project, costing $600,000 this year, recorded a rise in the  strait's biomass this summer ""to a higher level than ever found before in any  ocean,"" said Karl, who has visited Antarctica seven times since 1976. ""In the  winter, this water is essentially a biological desert. But in the spring, we  are finding that it blooms into a biological garden.""    The study also will help analyze aspects of the ""greenhouse effect"" of global  warming, thought to be caused by a steady increase in carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere. As the plant biomass of the Gerlache Strait grows and absorbs  carbon dioxide, that may allow the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide from the  atmosphere and, in effect, serve as ""a self-regulating mechanism that helps  keep us from totally ruining the environment,"" Karl said.    Huntley, a partner in the program known as RACER (Research on Antarctic Coastal  Ecosystem Rates), said the project has shown the strait to be 10 times richer  than the nutrient-filled fishing grounds off Peru.    Antarctica, known simply as ""The Ice"" by old hands, contains 70% of the world's  fresh water, and the cold currents welling from its shores are apparently an  engine for the world's seas.    ""What you've got here is a biological pump,"" Huntley said. ""The Gerlache is  seething with life. And if you've got a rich resource like this that depends on  a small locale, then you'd better be careful with it. It could be an incredibly  important nursing ground.""    In a climate with winter temperatures as low as 128.6 degrees below zero  Fahrenheit and where psychological tests are required for those who plan to  ""winter over,"" Ph.D. degrees don't suffice; scientists need ingenuity,  teamwork, stamina and imagination.    When he sent the frame back to the bottom for another eight-month sampling,  Karl resorted to an unlikely anchor: an old boiler taken from the junk heap at  Palmer Station.    Antarctica is so harsh an environment that it defies the ambitions of any  single nation, and nowhere in the world has international cooperation been so  extensive. The RACER program's 23 scientists come from seven nations.    ""With colleagues from India to Germany, you get a whole different conceptual  perspective,"" Huntley said. ""One has the sense of constantly being fertilized.  . . . A lot of the geopolitical nonsense falls away, and the human aspects  prevail. The common denominator is scientific research.""    That fits the treaty's declaration: ""It is in the interest of all mankind that  Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes  and shall not become the scene or object of international discord.""    The mean annual temperature in the interior of the continent is 70 degrees  below zero Fahrenheit. But along the Antarctic Peninsula jutting up toward the  tip of South America, the summer temperatures rise above freezing. That gives  rise to names like the ""Banana Belt"" and the ""Antarctic Riviera"" in a region of  majestic fiords and, between the outsized glaciers, much of the 2% of open  ground not covered by ice on the continent.    The peninsula is just two days by sea across the fearsome Drake Passage or a  two-hour flight aboard a C-130 Hercules to the Chilean airstrip at Teniente  Marsh Base on King George Island, making it accessible to scientists and a  steadily growing number of tourists alike.    The island is home to eight permanent research bases and also to the only hotel  in Antarctica, run by the Chilean military. Calling it Spartan is generous; the  hotel looks and feels like an elongated shipping container raised off the  barren ground beside the gravel landing strip, with a few cubicles off the  narrow hallway for people boarding ships in the bay for tours or transiting to  bases farther south.    The Bahia Paraiso was among several ships that call at Palmer Station, on  Anvers Island halfway down the peninsula. About 2,500 tourists made the trip  this season, up from 822 in 1983. A couple of tour ships plan to visit McMurdo  Station next year, the largest U.S. base, located on the opposite side of the  continent on the much colder Ross Sea.    Cross-country skiers, an airborne tour group and a cross-continent dog sled  expedition have also called at the third U.S. base, Amundsen-Scott at the South  Pole, during the last two summers.    Groups like the Environmental Defense Fund cite the Bahia Paraiso sinking in  demanding far stricter rules for tourism, including a ban on helicopter flights  and boat landings within 1,500 meters (about one mile) of wildlife sites and an  outright ban of any ship waste disposal in the Antarctic.    The National Science Foundation, which runs the U.S. Antarctic program, openly  discourages tourism and last year enacted regulations to control tourist  conduct.    Carol A. Roberts, deputy director of the National Science Foundation's division  of polar programs, cited three concerns: the impact of tourists on scientific  work, especially during disruptive visits to the stations; the tourists' impact  on the environment, underscored by the Argentine shipwreck, and the cost of  search and rescue. Palmer Station sacrificed most of its research season last  year to care for the Bahia Paraiso survivors and coordinate the cleanup and  analysis of the spill.    Nascent adventure tourism on the dangerous mainland, she said, threatens to  cause even greater problems in the future.    Roberts, who handles logistics for Antarctica, noted that the budget for  getting to and working in the region is greater than the science budget itself.    ""It's the last place on Earth; it's almost like going to the moon in a  logistical sense,"" she said.    The hazards were apparent on a recent trip by scientists setting out on a range  of expeditions, accompanied by NSF staffers evaluating environment and safety  problems.    The C-130 flight from Chile descended through clouds toward the airstrip in  35-knot crosswinds, just below the landing limit of 37 knots. The New York Air  National Guard pilot fought to keep the wallowing, yawing plane on course and  slammed it down on the airstrip. Parked, the plane shuddered in the wind.    A choppy, wet ride aboard rubber Zodiac rafts with outboard motors brought the  group to the Polar Duke, the workhorse U.S. Antarctic research ship. The  219-foot, ice-strengthened vessel serves as both transport to Palmer Station  and platform for some of the complex oceanographic studies that form the heart  of the NSF's $151-million annual Antarctic research program.    The new Norwegian captain, Tor-Arne Jakobsen, brought the ship into Palmer two  days later on a stormy night in a punishing 45-knot wind, down from the  66-knot, hurricane-force winds the previous day at the base.    Like many of the approximately 4,000 people who work each year in Antarctica,  Jakobsen had long sought the chance to be there. His father was captain of an  expedition there in 1950, and Jakobsen himself had sailed seven times to the  Arctic.    The charts Jakobsen used clearly showed the rocks struck by the Bahia Paraiso.  The Argentine charts apparently did not. Treaty countries are working now to  bring all charts used in the area up to date.    Staffo, the environmental officer who previously worked for NASA, cited a  number of other new safety measures. The NSF is testing devices to be carried  on expeditions that could be tracked by satellite, instantly pinpointing a  group's location.    But the U.S. focus is on the environment, especially waste disposal.  Macerators, which grind up sewage, were installed at Palmer and McMurdo  stations this year; the ""gray water"" is still pumped into the bays. Palmer, a  small station with just 40 residents in the summer, no longer burns its waste  but rather ""retrogrades"" it, jargon for shipping it back north. McMurdo, a much  larger center of more than 1,000 in summer, still burns waste every other  Sunday morning, a sore point for Greenpeace and other activist groups.    Peter Jorgensen, Palmer's contract manager, said 10 containers of refuse had  been shipped back this year, and a chartered ship had hauled away tons of junk  from the abandoned Old Palmer Station, across Arthur Harbor. Several years'  worth of old low-grade radioactive and dangerous waste was also sent back.    A priority, Staffo said, is to get suppliers to remove all plastics and excess  packing material before the goods are shipped. ""It's much easier to deal with  it in the States than once it gets out on the ice,"" he said.    The U.S. program suffered its own fuel spill this season when 10,000 to 12,000  gallons of oil spilled from old rubber fuel bladders at the airfield near  McMurdo, Staffo said. Since then, those bladders have been replaced with steel  tanks.    Scientists at Palmer last year could do little more than watch as the Bahia  Paraiso oil slick spread into nearby tidal coves and beyond. It took six days  for emergency crews to arrive with oil booms and other gear.    An estimated 60,000 gallons of fuel is still aboard the overturned vessel, but  NSF projects the cost at $60 million to remove the wreck. So it will remain in  its grave on a reef off DeLaca Island. American scientist Ted DeLaca was  working at Palmer at the time and watched the ship founder on the island named  for him.    Mahlon C. Kennicutt II, a scientist from Texas A&M University, was  returning to Palmer for a year-later analysis of the spill's impact. An  emergency team analysis conducted after the spill, whose results are to be  published in the May edition of Environmental Science and Technology magazine,  basically found that the bay made a quick recovery after the initial kill-off  of thousands of limpets and other invertebrates and about 300 birds.    The pounding of the surf and winds apparently helped cleanse the area within a  few weeks, Kennicutt said, but he now wants to see whether oil sediment that  penetrated the shoreline has caused longer-term damage.    He said the group found a very low population of microbes, ""proof of how  pristine the area is, since microbes thrive with pollution."" He will study  whether the microbes, which degrade hydrocarbons, have increased as a result.    ""The spill showed up the potential problem of tourism as the number of people  in the area increases. It's unfortunate, but it gave us a laboratory framework  to test the magnitude of a spill in such an area,"" he said. ""But for other  scientists who have been assessing the natural processes, to have this man-made  event introduced throws all the years of data into doubt.""

But more broadly, it has  encouraged a changing mentality toward tourism, research methods and  exploitation. The broken hulk also has reminded the world of the need to  preserve Antarctica as a uniquely shared and still-untainted laboratory for  understanding the planet's seas and skies.    The 25 nations that make up the Antarctic Treaty organization are working with  renewed energy on tougher rules to govern activities in the region. And some  countries are rebelling against an already strict 1988 agreement to govern oil  drilling and mineral mining, arguing instead for an outright ban.    The National Science Foundation, which runs the U.S. Antarctic program, is  removing the junk heaps that scar its three permanent bases and is hauling  shiploads of rubble back north. Even before the Bahia Paraiso sank, an  additional $8.3 million was budgeted for environmental and safety projects this  year. Cleaner sewer systems are being installed, environmental impact programs  are under review and emergency plans for oil spills are being drafted.    ""For years, Antarctica was approached in an expeditionary way,"" said Gary  Staffo, recently named as the National Science Foundation's polar safety and  environmental officer. ""It was seen as a one-time shot: 'We'll go do the  mission and get the people back and leave the trash behind.' Certainly that is  no longer acceptable -- and that is progress. There are greater expectations  now.""    Bahia Paraiso means Paradise Bay in Spanish, and that would have been an apt  name for the place where the ship foundered on rocks on Jan. 28, 1989, spilling  about 150,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the sea.    Elephant seals nuzzle noisily on a rocky island beach, adelie and chinstrap  penguins totter about, tiny limpets browse in the tidal basins and swarms of  shrimp-like krill bloom in springtime, hearty meals for the whales.    Across the bay, blue-white glacial ice cliffs rise hundreds of feet out of the  sea. The silence gives way to explosions as vast slabs break away and slide  into the water -- the ""calving"" of icebergs from the ice shelf that covers 98%  of the continent and is up to three miles thick near the South Pole.    Above all, Antarctica is a place for science. In recent years, the research has  taken on urgency as knowledge emerges of the environmental damage caused by  industrial-era pollution and its potential impact on the whole planet.    Other projects take advantage of the still-unspoiled seas and skies, with  constant winter nights and crystal summer days, to pursue cutting-edge studies  of phenomena such as cosmic rays and radiation belts.    And some scientists are finding a world startlingly abloom in what seems at  first such a bleak and lifeless place, fresh proof of the continent's crucial  role in the world's ecology.    Researchers David Karl of the University of Hawaii and Mark Huntley of the  Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, for example, are charting a  phenomenal mass of life in the Gerlache Strait along the Antarctic Peninsula.    From the pitching deck of the primary U.S. research ship the Polar Duke, Karl  sends an electronic pulse into the water, setting off a small explosion. That  frees a titanium frame holding a ring of 13 plastic bottles, and the device  floats up hundreds of feet to the surface.    All hands scan the choppy waters until Robert H. Rutford, president of the  University of Texas at Dallas and a veteran polar hand, spies the yellow buoys  astern. The ship's winch painstakingly recovers the experiment. Karl helps pull  aboard the frame and its harvest: five months' worth of organic sediment, much  of it excrement from luxuriant swarms of krill shellfish.    The ""catch"" is neatly divided into 11-day samples captured by the  computer-driven ring of revolving bottles attached to the bottom of a plastic  funnel. Some are near empty, but a couple, recording the height of the ""bloom,""  are nearly full.    The six-year project, costing $600,000 this year, recorded a rise in the  strait's biomass this summer ""to a higher level than ever found before in any  ocean,"" said Karl, who has visited Antarctica seven times since 1976. ""In the  winter, this water is essentially a biological desert. But in the spring, we  are finding that it blooms into a biological garden.""    The study also will help analyze aspects of the ""greenhouse effect"" of global  warming, thought to be caused by a steady increase in carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere. As the plant biomass of the Gerlache Strait grows and absorbs  carbon dioxide, that may allow the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide from the  atmosphere and, in effect, serve as ""a self-regulating mechanism that helps  keep us from totally ruining the environment,"" Karl said.    Huntley, a partner in the program known as RACER (Research on Antarctic Coastal  Ecosystem Rates), said the project has shown the strait to be 10 times richer  than the nutrient-filled fishing grounds off Peru.    Antarctica, known simply as ""The Ice"" by old hands, contains 70% of the world's  fresh water, and the cold currents welling from its shores are apparently an  engine for the world's seas.    ""What you've got here is a biological pump,"" Huntley said. ""The Gerlache is  seething with life. And if you've got a rich resource like this that depends on  a small locale, then you'd better be careful with it. It could be an incredibly  important nursing ground.""    In a climate with winter temperatures as low as 128.6 degrees below zero  Fahrenheit and where psychological tests are required for those who plan to  ""winter over,"" Ph.D. degrees don't suffice; scientists need ingenuity,  teamwork, stamina and imagination.    When he sent the frame back to the bottom for another eight-month sampling,  Karl resorted to an unlikely anchor: an old boiler taken from the junk heap at  Palmer Station.    Antarctica is so harsh an environment that it defies the ambitions of any  single nation, and nowhere in the world has international cooperation been so  extensive. The RACER program's 23 scientists come from seven nations.    ""With colleagues from India to Germany, you get a whole different conceptual  perspective,"" Huntley said. ""One has the sense of constantly being fertilized.  . . . A lot of the geopolitical nonsense falls away, and the human aspects  prevail. The common denominator is scientific research.""    That fits the treaty's declaration: ""It is in the interest of all mankind that  Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes  and shall not become the scene or object of international discord.""    The mean annual temperature in the interior of the continent is 70 degrees  below zero Fahrenheit. But along the Antarctic Peninsula jutting up toward the  tip of South America, the summer temperatures rise above freezing. That gives  rise to names like the ""Banana Belt"" and the ""Antarctic Riviera"" in a region of  majestic fiords and, between the outsized glaciers, much of the 2% of open  ground not covered by ice on the continent.    The peninsula is just two days by sea across the fearsome Drake Passage or a  two-hour flight aboard a C-130 Hercules to the Chilean airstrip at Teniente  Marsh Base on King George Island, making it accessible to scientists and a  steadily growing number of tourists alike.    The island is home to eight permanent research bases and also to the only hotel  in Antarctica, run by the Chilean military. Calling it Spartan is generous; the  hotel looks and feels like an elongated shipping container raised off the  barren ground beside the gravel landing strip, with a few cubicles off the  narrow hallway for people boarding ships in the bay for tours or transiting to  bases farther south.    The Bahia Paraiso was among several ships that call at Palmer Station, on  Anvers Island halfway down the peninsula. About 2,500 tourists made the trip  this season, up from 822 in 1983. A couple of tour ships plan to visit McMurdo  Station next year, the largest U.S. base, located on the opposite side of the  continent on the much colder Ross Sea.    Cross-country skiers, an airborne tour group and a cross-continent dog sled  expedition have also called at the third U.S. base, Amundsen-Scott at the South  Pole, during the last two summers.    Groups like the Environmental Defense Fund cite the Bahia Paraiso sinking in  demanding far stricter rules for tourism, including a ban on helicopter flights  and boat landings within 1,500 meters (about one mile) of wildlife sites and an  outright ban of any ship waste disposal in the Antarctic.    The National Science Foundation, which runs the U.S. Antarctic program, openly  discourages tourism and last year enacted regulations to control tourist  conduct.    Carol A. Roberts, deputy director of the National Science Foundation's division  of polar programs, cited three concerns: the impact of tourists on scientific  work, especially during disruptive visits to the stations; the tourists' impact  on the environment, underscored by the Argentine shipwreck, and the cost of  search and rescue. Palmer Station sacrificed most of its research season last  year to care for the Bahia Paraiso survivors and coordinate the cleanup and  analysis of the spill.    Nascent adventure tourism on the dangerous mainland, she said, threatens to  cause even greater problems in the future.    Roberts, who handles logistics for Antarctica, noted that the budget for  getting to and working in the region is greater than the science budget itself.    ""It's the last place on Earth; it's almost like going to the moon in a  logistical sense,"" she said.    The hazards were apparent on a recent trip by scientists setting out on a range  of expeditions, accompanied by NSF staffers evaluating environment and safety  problems.    The C-130 flight from Chile descended through clouds toward the airstrip in  35-knot crosswinds, just below the landing limit of 37 knots. The New York Air  National Guard pilot fought to keep the wallowing, yawing plane on course and  slammed it down on the airstrip. Parked, the plane shuddered in the wind.    A choppy, wet ride aboard rubber Zodiac rafts with outboard motors brought the  group to the Polar Duke, the workhorse U.S. Antarctic research ship. The  219-foot, ice-strengthened vessel serves as both transport to Palmer Station  and platform for some of the complex oceanographic studies that form the heart  of the NSF's $151-million annual Antarctic research program.    The new Norwegian captain, Tor-Arne Jakobsen, brought the ship into Palmer two  days later on a stormy night in a punishing 45-knot wind, down from the  66-knot, hurricane-force winds the previous day at the base.    Like many of the approximately 4,000 people who work each year in Antarctica,  Jakobsen had long sought the chance to be there. His father was captain of an  expedition there in 1950, and Jakobsen himself had sailed seven times to the  Arctic.    The charts Jakobsen used clearly showed the rocks struck by the Bahia Paraiso.  The Argentine charts apparently did not. Treaty countries are working now to  bring all charts used in the area up to date.    Staffo, the environmental officer who previously worked for NASA, cited a  number of other new safety measures. The NSF is testing devices to be carried  on expeditions that could be tracked by satellite, instantly pinpointing a  group's location.    But the U.S. focus is on the environment, especially waste disposal.  Macerators, which grind up sewage, were installed at Palmer and McMurdo  stations this year; the ""gray water"" is still pumped into the bays. Palmer, a  small station with just 40 residents in the summer, no longer burns its waste  but rather ""retrogrades"" it, jargon for shipping it back north. McMurdo, a much  larger center of more than 1,000 in summer, still burns waste every other  Sunday morning, a sore point for Greenpeace and other activist groups.    Peter Jorgensen, Palmer's contract manager, said 10 containers of refuse had  been shipped back this year, and a chartered ship had hauled away tons of junk  from the abandoned Old Palmer Station, across Arthur Harbor. Several years'  worth of old low-grade radioactive and dangerous waste was also sent back.    A priority, Staffo said, is to get suppliers to remove all plastics and excess  packing material before the goods are shipped. ""It's much easier to deal with  it in the States than once it gets out on the ice,"" he said.    The U.S. program suffered its own fuel spill this season when 10,000 to 12,000  gallons of oil spilled from old rubber fuel bladders at the airfield near  McMurdo, Staffo said. Since then, those bladders have been replaced with steel  tanks.    Scientists at Palmer last year could do little more than watch as the Bahia  Paraiso oil slick spread into nearby tidal coves and beyond. It took six days  for emergency crews to arrive with oil booms and other gear.    An estimated 60,000 gallons of fuel is still aboard the overturned vessel, but  NSF projects the cost at $60 million to remove the wreck. So it will remain in  its grave on a reef off DeLaca Island. American scientist Ted DeLaca was  working at Palmer at the time and watched the ship founder on the island named  for him.    Mahlon C. Kennicutt II, a scientist from Texas A&M University, was  returning to Palmer for a year-later analysis of the spill's impact. An  emergency team analysis conducted after the spill, whose results are to be  published in the May edition of Environmental Science and Technology magazine,  basically found that the bay made a quick recovery after the initial kill-off  of thousands of limpets and other invertebrates and about 300 birds.    The pounding of the surf and winds apparently helped cleanse the area within a  few weeks, Kennicutt said, but he now wants to see whether oil sediment that  penetrated the shoreline has caused longer-term damage.    He said the group found a very low population of microbes, ""proof of how  pristine the area is, since microbes thrive with pollution."" He will study  whether the microbes, which degrade hydrocarbons, have increased as a result.    ""The spill showed up the potential problem of tourism as the number of people  in the area increases. It's unfortunate, but it gave us a laboratory framework  to test the magnitude of a spill in such an area,"" he said. ""But for other  scientists who have been assessing the natural processes, to have this man-made  event introduced throws all the years of data into doubt.""

0,FT921-6447 ,"FT921-6447 _AN-CB0CIAFQFT 920227   FT  27 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Bitter battle at the Carnival - Rival Brazilian brewers' plans to get ahead      By CHRISTINA LAMB   When a thousand drummers start beating out the samba rhythm on Sunday, opening Rio's Carnival parade, there will be more at stake than the usual struggle for supremacy between samba schools in choreography, costume and song. This year's Carnival has become the glitter-clad battleground for a marketing war between Brazil's two largest beer producers. Brazil's 6bn litre annual beer market is hotly contested by two companies - Antarctica and Brahma - each of which claims to produce the best-selling brand. Brahma, Brazil's largest brewer, is currently ahead with 35.4 per cent of the market for its main seller, Brahma Chopp, but Antarctica's Blue Label is hot on its heels with 33 per cent. Both companies are gearing up to take advantage of the five days of extravaganza in which economic woes are forgotten, men dress up as women and women wear very little indeed. Brahma was the first to spot the potential of Carnival. One of its factories lies alongside the Sambadrome where the official parades take place. When the stadium was built in 1984, the company was given one of the best boxes in exchange for part of its land. Last year its marketing director decided to exploit this, inviting personalities and ensuring that the box - and of course the brand name  - was the focus of attention of the television cameras beaming the scene live to 40m viewers. 'Carnival means happiness and parties, when everyone forgets recession and misery and has a good time. That's what we want our beer to be associated with,' explains Inga Ostrovsky, Brahma's marketing director. But the idea proved such a success that Antarctica is copying it. Nizan Guanaes from the company's advertising agency says: 'We've gone for the Japanese philosophy - copy it and improve it'. He heads a team hard at work in a flat in Ipanema, plotting how best to capitalise on the five days in which the whole of Brazil lets its hair down. Over the next two weeks the two companies will spend nearly Dollars 1m (Pounds 575,000) sponsoring rival samba schools, street bands and Carnival balls. They have also rented boxes in the Sambadrome to which they have invited international stars to watch the 50,000 people parading. Brazil's beer industry had traditionally kept a fairly low profile attracting little investment until a year ago. Then, after a takeover by Banco Garantia, Brahma announced investment plans to increase production to 4.3bn litres a year by 1993 and launched an aggressive marketing campaign. Brahma is now one of Brazil's biggest spenders on advertising with an annual budget of Dollars 25m, recruiting leading singer-songwriter Tom Jobim and splashing its slogan 'Number One Beer' across buses, billboards and magazines. Not to be outdone, Antarctica is increasing production by 48 per cent this year and has upped its advertising spending to Dollars 25m, running a campaign under the slogan 'Antarctica, the Best and the First and there is nothing more to be said'. The battle hotted up last October when the government freed beer prices after years of controls. Sales fell 10 per cent last month because of recession and both companies have fixed their sights on Carnival to boost their market-share. Each has an eye, too, on the international potential and are hoping tourists visiting Rio will remember the beer they drank when they return to their homes. This year, for the two days of parades, Brahma's 'Number One' box will play host to 350 politicians, film stars and leading society figures. Little more than 200 metres away, Antarctica's boxes will offer a night-long banquet followed by breakfast, with sleeping areas available for those who cannot take the pace. While Brahma is reticent about the names of its VIPs (though dropping rumours of the presence of Kevin Costner and Richard Gere), Antarctica confirms it will be playing host to singer Liza Minelli, film-Canadian model Linda Evangelista. However, hopes that this will draw the television cameras have been foiled. The two leading channels have agreed not to show the brand names and they plan to give plain white T-shirts to anyone they interview. Both brewers feel they have already had value for money. Brahma is spending Dollars 300,000 and Antarctica Dollars 500,000 and Guanaes says: 'The idea was to create an event the whole city is talking about and we've certainly done that even before Carnival'. Ostrovsky agrees: 'It's not really a war - it's a show like everything else in Carnival and one that we're both capitalising on'.

Now, this vast and beautiful wilderness is far more accessible. Several companies, for example, are offering cruises on ships with ice-hardened hulls, the amenities of four-star hotels, cabins with en suite facilities, and zodiacs (small inflatable dinghies) for shore landings. Going to the Antarctic is still an adventure, but one that can be enjoyed in comfort. The only time it is possible to go, when the southern oceans are free from ice, is between October and March, the Antarctic summer. From Britain, passengers fly from London to Chile or Argentina with embarkation at Montevideo, Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas or Ushuaia. Landings are made, depending on length of voyage and weather, in the Falklands, South Georgia, South Orkneys, South Shetlands, Antarctic peninsula and, on the return journey, Cape Horn and Puerto Williams in the Chilean fiords. First in the field of passenger expedition ships was Clipper's World Discoverer (3,700 tons), which has taken people to the Antarctic since 1974. It is a small, comfortable, friendly ship, with the accent on giving passengers (maximum 139) a learning experience rather than a cruise - films and lectures of an evening rather than casino and cabaret. However, it has a fitness centre, sauna, small pool, beauty salon, cinema and library. Lecturers, who act as guides on shore, include polar historians, geologists, ornithologists and marine biologists; 16- to 23-day voyages cost from Pounds 4,756 to Pounds 8,466 per person depending on accommodation and length of trip. (London tel: 071-436-2931). Ocean Cruise Lines' (tel: 071-724-7555) Ocean Princess (12,200 tons) carries 460 people and provides more mass-appeal cruising. As well as a team of specialist lecturers, there is nightly dancing and cabaret, a piano bar and casino. It also has a library, gym, sauna, pool, health club and beauty salon. Prices for 20-22 days: from Pounds 2,295. Several tour operators use both these ships but provide their own natural history guides. Birdquest (tel: 0254-826317) takes small groups (maximum 12) on World Discoverer and they can act independently on board and shore excursions. Price for 25 days: Pounds 6,680 London return, or Pounds 5,840 Santiago return. Abercrombie  Kent (tel: 071-730-9600) uses Ocean Princess and takes groups of about 30. AK also owns Explorer (2,398 tons), the smallest ice-strengthened passenger vessel in Antarctica, which carries the least number of people (96) to the largest ratio of specialist lecturers (12). In spite of its size, it has a sauna, library, gift shop and lecture hall-cinema. Prices for 16-23 days: from Pounds 4,128 to Pounds 6,297. To visit the far side of the Antarctic, south of New Zealand, Noble Caledonia (071-491-4752) offers cruises aboard Frontier Spirit (5,000 tons), an exploration vessel for 130 passengers. Sailings are from New Zealand via Terra Nova Bay, Ross Ice Shelf, McMurdo Sound and Ross Island. Prices, from Pounds 4,500 to Pounds 7,995 for a verandah suite, include return flight London-New Zealand, two nights in Auckland, two in Sydney and 22 on board. For the longest voyage of all (31 days), Quark Expeditions' (071-490-2211) 18,000-ton Russian ice breaker, Kapitan Khlebnikov, sails from Cape Town to Perth stopping in the Antarctic en route. The price, from Pounds 5,955 to Pounds 8,300, includes air travel London-Cape Town-Perth-London and 22 nights on board. Information about Antarctic cruises can be obtained from Paul Mundy (071-734-4404), the cruise specialist.  The Financial Times   London Page XII  "

Minister Figueroa explained that the Chilean stance is  slightly different from the French position, which establishes a  whale sanctuary from 40 degrees latitude south to Antarctica,  including Chilean waters from the city of Valdivia, 835 km south  of Santiago, to Cape Horn, at 56 degrees latitude south.    The foreign minister emphasized that Chile wants to explain  at the next International Whale Commission (IWC) meeting,  scheduled in Puerto Vallarta (Mexico) from 23 to 27 May, a  ""consistent"" position with respect to the four sea treaties or  conventions that it has signed.    Chile has signed conventions on the sea, on the sea bed, and  on high seas fishing, as well as a treaty on territorial seas.

He therefore  indicated that our country ""has already initiated unilateral  protection of this resource.""    The foreign minister confirmed that Chile is willing to sign  a broad multilateral agreement to protect whale species. He  noted that there are fairly advanced studies on the situation of  the ecosystem at the abovementioned Antarctic convergence.    Representatives of the ""Greenpeace"" ecological organization  in Chile delivered on 11 May to the president of the Republic,  Eduardo Frei, a petition with more than 300,000 signatures  supporting the establishment of a sanctuary for the last whale  populations in the South Pacific.    According to data supplied by this ecological organization,  more than 1 million whales have been hunted down over the past  80 years, and the ""blue whale,"" the largest whale species on our  planet at 32 meters long and 100 metric tons in weight, has been  particularly affected.

The foreign minister emphasized that Chile wants to explain  at the next International Whale Commission (IWC) meeting,  scheduled in Puerto Vallarta (Mexico) from 23 to 27 May, a  ""consistent"" position with respect to the four sea treaties or  conventions that it has signed.    Chile has signed conventions on the sea, on the sea bed, and  on high seas fishing, as well as a treaty on territorial seas.    The foreign minister noted that Chile has banned whale  hunting within its 200-mile territorial waters. He therefore  indicated that our country ""has already initiated unilateral  protection of this resource.""    The foreign minister confirmed that Chile is willing to sign  a broad multilateral agreement to protect whale species. He  noted that there are fairly advanced studies on the situation of  the ecosystem at the abovementioned Antarctic convergence.    Representatives of the ""Greenpeace"" ecological organization  in Chile delivered on 11 May to the president of the Republic,  Eduardo Frei, a petition with more than 300,000 signatures  supporting the establishment of a sanctuary for the last whale  populations in the South Pacific.    According to data supplied by this ecological organization,  more than 1 million whales have been hunted down over the past  80 years, and the ""blue whale,"" the largest whale species on our  planet at 32 meters long and 100 metric tons in weight, has been  particularly affected.

0,FT911-1769 ,"FT911-1769 _AN-BECBBABHFT 910503   FT  03 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Antarctica's frozen future   ONLY A short time ago, it seemed as if the long debate between those who want to turn Antarctica into a world nature reserve and the proponents of a regulated exploitation of its potential mineral resources, would never be resolved. A group of nations, led by Australia and France and convinced that an environmental disaster would overtake the frozen continent if it were opened to mineral exploitation, insisted that the 39 signatories of the 1961 Antarctica treaty should impose a permanent ban on mining. Others, such as Britain, Japan and the US, considered it was wrong to commit future generations to policies which might no longer be appropriate in a very different economic, political and environmental context. Yet after the latest conference of member countries in Madrid, it suddenly looks as if a compromise on this contentious issue is in the offing. All the member countries realised, after the deadlock reached at their previous meeting in Chile last November, that the necessary consensus for decisions could be achieved only if they abandoned their entrenched positions. The proposed 50-year moratorium on mining prospection and exploitation offers a politically acceptable way out of the impasse, though it appears to favour the environmentalists more than the mining lobby. Britain, the US and Japan have always argued that their main objection to the Franco-Australian position was that it involved a permanent ban on mining activities. They made it clear that, if the new arrangements allowed the exploitation of Antarctica's mineral wealth in the long run, that would be acceptable, given an agreement on the duration of the ban. Yet it appears that the moratorium, in the compromise proposed by Norway and Spain, would be virtually open-ended. It would remain in effect even after the expiry of the 50-year period, unless a 75 per cent majority of the treaty's consultative members decided otherwise, an unrealistic prospect. Whether such a long moratorium is in the best interests of the international community remains a moot point. Certainly, in a world increasingly subject to environmental disasters, ranging from the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power station to the horrific oil fires of Kuwait, it is tempting to embrace the idea that an environmental safe haven can be created somewhere on this scarred planet. Yet the arguments on the other side should not be minimised. Though no valuable mineral deposits have yet been discovered on the continent, Antarctica's coastal shelf is estimated to contain substantial oil resources. These might be sorely needed in the event of a future world oil shortage, either as the result of depletion of existing reserves or military conflicts in traditional oil-producing regions. Rather than opting for the extreme course of taking an area equivalent to one-tenth of the world's land and sea surface out of economic circulation for 50 years or more, it would be better to search for an intermediate solution. A shorter moratorium of perhaps 20 to 30 years would allow sufficient time for international regulations to be worked out to ensure that mineral extraction, when and if it eventually takes place, is conducted within generally accepted environmental norms. It is unfortunate that the consensus required by the Antarctica treaty appears virtually to have ruled out such a solution.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

Twelve days of talks here among the 39 Antarctic Treaty nations, discussions  dominated by the mining issue, broke up Friday night with a wide division  between the pro- and anti-mining nations.    Australia and France had proposed that Antarctica be turned into a wilderness  park and that the Minerals Convention of 1988, which took six years to  negotiate, be scrapped.    Britain and the United States refused to discuss this proposal and insisted  that the conference should talk about implementing the convention and discuss  clauses that would apportion liability in the case of mining pollution. The  Minerals Convention creates a framework for mining under strict environmental  guidelines.    At the end of the conference, it was decided to hold another two meetings in  Chile next year. One would discuss comprehensive environmental issues for the  Antarctic and the second would talk about accident liability clauses for  minerals.    Both sides refused to compromise but were aware that walking out of the meeting  would have destroyed the Antarctic Treaty system that has controlled the region  for 30 years, prevented armed conflict and promoted scientific cooperation.    John Heap, head of Britain's delegation, said London is not prepared to discuss  the wilderness park idea if it excludes all mining.    ""The last great wilderness is the size of the United States and Europe put  together,"" Heap said. ""Is it inevitable that a mine site somewhere in  Antarctica would despoil all Antarctica?

Krill are a staple for a wide range of antarctic creatures,  including whales, seals, penguins and a host of other sea birds and fish.    But scientists do not know what will happen to the antarctic food chain as  krill are increasingly harvested for human and livestock consumption. Nearly  half a dozen countries, including the Soviet Union, Japan and Korea, harvest  krill, using new technology that makes it easier to pull the creatures from the  ocean.    Consequently, it is krill -- and their relationship to the rest of the  antarctic world -- that scientists aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration research vessel Surveyor will study during a five-month voyage.  The Surveyor is scheduled to cast off from San Diego's 10th Avenue Terminal  today.    Three local scientists associated with the National Marine Fisheries Service's  Southwest Fisheries Center in La Jolla will be among the Surveyor's dozen  researchers. They are Izadore Barrett, director of science and research, and  Roger Hewitt and Rennie Holt, marine biologists. Holt is also program manager  of the U.S. Antarctic Marine Living Resources program.    It will take the Surveyor a month to reach Antarctica and another month to  return. Most of the scientists will fly there to meet the ship.    Data gathered during the three-month research effort will be turned over to the  U.S. delegate to the Convention of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living  Resources. The convention is connected with the 1961 international Antarctic  Treaty, in which a group of nations agreed to use Antarctica for peaceful,  scientific exploration.    ""The management of antarctic krill fisheries should include not only how much  krill can be taken, but more importantly, where it can be taken,"" Holt said.  ""This is because heavy areas of krill concentrations are also home to vast  numbers of the animals dependent on krill for survival.""    Not surprisingly, Holt said, these same areas are the main target of krill  fishermen. ""Harvest of these krill . . . could impact the other animals as  well,"" he said. A growing international fleet of krill-harvesting vessels is  being drawn to Antarctica, where scientists have observed ""super swarms"" of  krill that cover many square miles of ocean.    Scientists on board the Surveyor will use state-of-the-art equipment to measure  krill populations. They hope to chart known krill populations in order to  determine how krill harvesting affects the ecosystem.    Besides studying krill, Surveyor scientists will study the feeding habits of  fur seals and penguins, species that consume large quantities of krill. They  also will study the microscopic algae and plants that krill feed on.      Photo, Roger Hewitt and Karen Dunning prepare for a five-month antarctic  expedition on research vessel Surveyor.

R. 645201200 through 220 (30 CFR 772.11), notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration,   Utah Admin. R. 645202100 (30 CFR 815.13), required documents,  Utah Admin. R. 645202232 (30 CFR 815.15(b)), performance standards for roads or other transportation facilities used for coal exploration, and      Utah Admin. R. 645202235 (30 CFR 815.15(i), performance standards which minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance.           Because these proposed Utah rules are substantially identical to the corresponding provisons of the Federal regulations, the Director finds that they are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules.        3. Utah Admin. R. 645200122, R. 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310, Coal Exploration in Relation to an Approved Permit Area        Utah proposed that its rules at Utah Admin. R. 645200122, 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310 setting forth the scope of Utah's coal exploration rules, would apply to ``coal exploration'' instead of coal exploration that occurs ``outside an approved permit area'' or coal exploration that occurs'' ``in relation to an approved permit area.''    The corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11, for coal exploration operations removing 250 tons or less of coal, and at 30 CFR 772.12, for coal exploration operations removing more than 250 tons of coal, apply to coal exploration conducted ``outside a permit area.'' In promulgating this language, OSM explained in the preamble for these Federal regulations that a coal exploration permit is not appropriate for coal exploration on lands covered by a surface coal mining permit because exploration within the permit area should have been planned as an integral part of the surface coal mining and reclamation operations (44 FR 14901, 150178; March 13, 1979). The effect of these Federal regulations is that, for proposed coal exploration within the permit area, the State regulatory authority would review and approve, as appropriate, the proposed coal exploration in conjunction with the review and approval of a permit application, and for coal exploration outside the permit area, would review and approve the proposed coal exploration pursuant to the appropriate rules for coal exploration.      Utah's proposed deletions of the phrases concerning approved permit areas are consistent with OSM's regulations and the rationale for them in the preamble to the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director finds that Utah's proposed revisions to Utah Amin. R. 645200122, 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310 are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11 and 772.12. The Director approves these proposed rules.            4. Utah Admin. R. 645200220, 645200230, and 645201100 through 645201130, Responsibilities of the Division and Coal Exploration Plan Review        Utah proposed revisions to its rules at (1) Utah Admin. R. 645200220 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review and enforce the terms of each notice of intention to conduct coal exploration; (2) Utah Amin. R. 645200230 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review and approve or disapprove major coal exploration applications and issue, condition, suspend, revoke, and enforce major coal exploration permits and coordinate with other government agencies; and (3) Utah Admin. R. 645201100 through 645201130 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review coal exploration plans on lands which are not subject to the requirements of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487, and to provide that, on lands [Federal lands] where the requirements of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487 apply, the review of coal exploration plans will be guided by the appropriate part of 43 CFR.    The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 772 establish the requirements and procedures applicable to coal exploration operations on all lands except for Federal lands subject to the requirements of 43 CFR parts 3480 through 3487. The Federal regulations at 43 CFR 3480 through 3487 pertain to operations for the exploration, development, and production of Federal coal under Federal coal leases, licenses, and permits, regardless of surface ownership, pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181,     et seq.    ). The responsibility for administration of the Mineral Leasing Act is vested with the Bureau of Land Management.       "," FR940927-0-00067   FR940927-0-00009        Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment.      1. Nonsubstantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules        Utah proposed revisions to the following previously approved rules that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist of minor editorial or grammatical changes (the corresponding Federal regulation provisions are listed in parentheses):         Utah Admin. R. 645201323.100 (30 CFR 772.12(b)(8)(iv)), narrative description of the proposed exploration area, and     Utah Admin. R. 645201342.200 (30 CFR 772.12(d)(2)(ii)), approval or disapproval of an application for a major coal exploration permit.           Because the proposed revisions to these previously approved rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director finds that the proposed Utah rules are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules.        2.

Is it  not too great a luxury for the country, whose economy is  experiencing far from the best of times, to allow itself such  expensive projects?    In the words of Valeriy Kalatskiy, first deputy chief of the  Federal Service of Russia for Hydrometeorology and Environmental  Monitoring, even from a purely economical standpoint it is  necessary to preserve the Russian scientific stations in  Antarctica.    Such enormous work has now been done that for Russia it is  more advantageous to complete it and not to give it up and then  start all over again. At the Vostok continental station a hole  2,751 meters deep has already been drilled, unique scientific  data, the value of which it is difficult to overestimate, have  been obtained. So much money has already been invested in this  project that if the station is shut down, the losses will prove  to be greater than the assets which it remained to invest.    This year Rosgidromet [the Federal Service of Russia for  Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring] is not receiving  the full financing of the expedition. However, life is making it  incumbent to enter the market, scientists are not only going  about with an outstretched hand. In accordance with bilateral  understandings with the United States it is succeeding in  financing in part the research in Antarctica. Another two  intergovernmental agreements with Chile and Italy on the  conducting of research in Antarctica with the use of the Russian  scientific and material potential have now been prepared. It is  a matter, first of all, of the Vostok station--one of two that  are located in the center of Antarctica. These agreements are  making it possible to partially finance the expedition. And  nevertheless there is not enough money, because financing is  being carried out with a delay. The prices for fuel, for  example, have increased by nearly tenfold, while the indexing of  expenditures is being carried out with a coefficient of 1.8.    Now five operating stations out of eight remain. But it is  necessary to recover somehow from the situation. If in the  immediate future it is not possible to settle the question of  financing, the Vostok station will have to be shut down,  inasmuch as there is practically no fuel left there. Precisely  the question of the delivery of fuel is now ``bringing to a  standstill'' the entire expedition.    But Vostok is a unique station. If we lose it, we will lose  not only the material support of foreign partners, but also  scientific data, which are so necessary. Work is being performed  here under the ozone layer monitoring program, the deep drilling  of the glacial cover, which here is nearly the greatest on  earth, is being carried out.    These data are necessary for the making of a forecast, on  the  basis of which decisions on the reaction of the decrease of the  ozone layer and the change of the climate, behind which lie  enormous material expenditures on the scale of the country, will  be made at the state level. But this is not so much a scientific  question as it is an economic one.    One must also not forget that as a result of geological  research in Antarctica mineral deposits were discovered. To  ignore this means not to care about the future, to say nothing  of the international obligations of Russia and our prestige.      "

Scientists with the Stratospheric Ozone Review Group said  yesterday that despite measures to phase out ozone-depleting  chemicals, such as the aerosol gases chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),  the layer will continue to be destroyed into the early part of  next century.    By 2005, the levels of ultraviolet light hitting Aberdeen  could be equivalent to those in mid-France.    Joe Farman, of the European Ozone Research Coordinating Unit  and the man who discovered the ozone hole over Antarctica in  1985, said the main threat could be to seedlings and  ""pollinating insects at the heart of the food chain.""    He said that to the best of his knowledge no research had  been carried out on the links between higher levels of UV and  insects such as bees increased levels of ultraviolet light may  damage the leaves of seedlings and kill insects by damaging  their genetic material.    As the ozone layer thins, environmentalists and medical  researchers fear that the levels of skin cancer will rise. The  UN has predicted that a 10 per cent decrease in the ozone layer  will lead to 300,000 more skin cancers a year and 1.75 million  cataracts.    Dr John Pyle of Cambridge University, chairman of the ozone  review group, said this was unlikely, particularly if people  took sensible protective measures such as wearing a hat and sun  cream.    The fifth report of the group, which was set up in 1985 by  the Department of the Environment and the Meteorological Office,  assesses the results from satellite measurements, aircraft and  field work. It finds that between May 1992 and May 1993 the  average global thickness of ozone fell by between 2 and 3 per  cent. Over northern Europe, however, winter levels of ozone  slumped by around 25 per cent between 1991 and 1993.    The scientists said the sharp decline was partly due to  unusual weather conditions, in particular a strong and  persistent anticyclone over the area, and the eruption of Mount  Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991.    They also said the destruction was triggered by a build-up  of  chlorine chemicals. Such chemicals, released from products such  as aerosols, refrigerants and fire extinguishers, have been  shown to be causing the hole over Antarctica, but these are the  first firm findings showing they are also damaging ozone over  the northern hemisphere.    The scientists said that measures under the Montreal  Protocol  to phase out CFCs and some other ozone-depleting chemicals by  1996 were working, with concentrations beginning to tail off.  Nevertheless, build-ups of breakdown chemicals, the actual ozone  killers, will persist into the next century, peaking between  2000 and 2005. This is likely to trigger a 20 to 25 per cent  average thinning over Britain and northern Europe since records  began in 1979. Dr Pyle said the hole over Antarctica was  unlikely to disappear until 2080.    The scientists also called on the Government to save  Snoopy, the C130 Herculese aircraft operated by the  Meteorological Research Flight at Farnham, Hampshire. Last week  The Times reported that the plane, which is involved  in crucial atmospheric research, was on a Ministry of Defence  hit list. While America and Germany are building new research  aircraft, Britain will have none if Snoopy goes.    Dr Pyle said the aircraft was not only vital for research,  but secured Britain a presence in scientific projects of  international importance.     "

The company blames a fall in oil and natural gas prices as well as the Polish government's failure to extend tax breaks. Both Amoco and British Gas which won similar rights last autumn have made a start to full scale exploration operations contingent on the extension of tax concessions. Amoco says it will nevertheless be bidding for new exploration tracts in Poland and will continue with a USDollars 10m exploration programme for coal bed methane on a 120,000-acre patch in Silesia. Amoco had originally planned to spend USDollars 20m on exploration in Poland.

Today brings the final episode of Life In The Freezer, a series about Antarctica which has sustained and sometimes surpassed the extraordinarily high standards set by Attenborough and the BBC's Bristol Natural History Unit in their previous programmes (8.00 BBC1). Television has been as influential as any other factor in driving back the celebration of the winter solstice to the pre-religious roots from which it sprang. Christmas Time In Vienna is a concert starring Placido Domingo, Dionne Warwick, and Ruggero Raimondi. Some of their songs may well have Christian origins, but that seems fortuitous: this is entertainment rather than an expression of faith (8.00 BBC2).

0,FT931-10453 ,"FT931-10453 _AN-DBICOABKFT 930209   FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Amoco narrows exploration focus  -The US oil group is ditching its 'shotgun approach'      By LAURIE MORSE   AMOCO, the Chicago-based oil company and North America's largest producer of natural gas, spent last year cutting both production and administration costs to adjust to lower world energy prices. Now the company is tackling the costs of its international exploration and development operations. .Amoco is narrowing its exploration focus. Where it once had operations in more than 100 countries, it has now reduced this number to 40. 'We had been taking something of a shotgun approach,' said Mr J. C. Burton, group vice-president in charge of international operations. 'Now we're going to focus more on bread and butter things. We've decided we can't be everywhere at once, even though we're a big company.' He said the new strategy was to prospect only in countries where the likelihood of finding reserves was high and where Amoco's competitive advantages could best be deployed. It also entailed managing the group's reserve portfolio more actively, retaining only those assets fitting in with core operations. Last month, for example, Amoco swapped its rights to offshore oil and gas holdings in the western portion of the North Sea with British Gas's offshore parcels in the southern North Sea, thereby consolidating its low-cost holdings there. Amoco is drawing back from risky frontier exploration and concentrating on proven basins where it has competitive advantage. In eastern Europe, Amoco hopes to apply the gasification techniques it developed in its New Mexico operations to Poland's well-explored coal fields. Meanwhile, political and technical expertise is being combined in talks with the Chinese on a Dollars 600m offshore production venture in the South China Sea. In addition, a long-term investment in Trinidad, where Amoco is developing two fields, paid off this year when the company gained tax concessions there, raising profits. Amoco entered the global exploration business later than most of its rivals. While it had longstanding operations in Egypt and Argentina, it did not begin its worldwide expansion programme until the mid-1980s. This meant it had to play an expensive game of catch-up. It found that many low-cost production areas had already been claimed by its competitors. It also moved into politically unstable countries, such as Somalia, and then had to abandon sites, so losing substantial investment. Mr James Murchie, oil industry analyst for Sanford Bernstein, the New York investment house, says Amoco's frantic frontier exploration boosted the cost of finding and developing reserves to more than Dollars 6 a barrel, well above the industry average of about Dollars 5. Frontier exploration is seen increasingly by the world's oil companies as an extremely risky business and Amoco's decision to pull back is in keeping with this trend. While narrowing its world reach, the bulk of Amoco's exploration and development expenditure will still be spent outside the US. The company's 1993 capital spending plan budgets Dollars 3.2bn for exploration and development, of which 70 per cent will be spent overseas. Amoco plans to drill about 50 exploration wells in 1993, 90 per cent of them at foreign sites. This contradicts the pattern of 1970, when 70 per cent of Amoco's Dollars 647m exploration expenditure was spent at home. Those mature domestic operations now generate the cash to finance Amoco's hunt for new reserves overseas. However, that hunt is behind schedule. Mr Burton admits the company has not been replacing production at industry rates over the past two years, but says the exploration cycle has to be averaged over the long term. 'We try not to get excited about a few bad years,' he says. Amoco produces the oil-equivalent of 500m barrels a year. Analysts say annual exploration and development investment of Dollars 2.5bn would be required to replace reserves, assuming the industry average cost of Dollars 5 a barrel. This year, Amoco has earmarked only about Dollars 2bn.   Companies:-  Amoco.   Countries:-  CaZnada.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.     P6719 Holding Companies, NEC.

Trevor Potts and three colleagues left Elephant Island in Antarctica on December 24.

Having made landfall, they ran into force 8 gales - recalling the harsh lee shore conditions encountered by Shackleton in 1916 - but found shelter in Elsehul, a rocky harbour at the north west tip of South Georgia and landed on January 5. The crew plans to cross the neck of land known as the Shackleton Gap on foot, tracing, in reverse, part of the route the explorer took on his mountain trek to Stromness, the Norwegian whaling station, where he found help for his marooned companions.

But the US still takes the biggest share of exploration spending by the major companies, according to the Canadian consultants, Metals Economics Group. Budgets of the 137 companies reviewed total USDollars 1.7bn. Of this, Dollars 345m is directed to the US. Australia gets Dollars 333m, Latin America Dollars 331m, Canada Dollars 295m and the Pacific area Dollars 124m. MEG points out that Canada has dropped from first place in terms of exploration activity in 1989 to fourth this year. Latin American countries receiving the most exploration attention this year are Chile, with about 40 per cent of the total for the region; Mexico, about 20 per cent; and Brazil, about 19 per cent. The percentage of expenditure directed to gold targets has been falling steadily in recent years, according to MEG, while base metals-related spending has been rising after a very low level of activity in the mid-1980s. In this case the consultants reviewed the exploration spending plans of 139 companies, totalling USDollars 1.9bn, and found Dollars 925m (48.7 per cent of the total) being spent on gold this year compared with Dollars 839m or 52 per cent in 1992 and Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent in 1991. Base metals exploration expenditure this year is Dollars 669m or 35 per cent of the total, compared with 32 per cent of the reported spend in 1992. More than half the spending directed at other mining targets is for diamond exploration. Some 29 big companies are involved in the search for diamonds, but the Dollars 111.7m budgetted for diamond exploration and research by De Beers of South Africa remains unchallenged. RTZ Corporation of the UK, the world's biggest mining company, is also the biggest spender on exploration, MEG suggests. Including the budget for CRA, its 49 per cent-owned Australian associate, RTZ is spending Dollars 200m this year compared with De Beers Dollars 111.7m. The third largest corporate exploration budget, Dollars 71.8m, is attributed to BHP Minerals, part of the Australian resources group.

These days persuade David Jason to appear in a TV series and it seems destined to be a smash hit. But Jason worked his way through the ranks.

0,FT931-701 ,"FT931-701 _AN-DC2BZABSFT 930329   FT  29 MAR 93 / Letter: Tax proposals will hit small oil exploration companies while benefiting large producers      From Dr MICHAEL F RIDD   Sir, Since the chancellor's budget statement your pages have carried the reactions of two of the biggest North Sea oil companies to the proposed changes in the Petroleum Revenue Tax arrangements ('North Sea group may halve exploration after oil tax change', March 24). At the other end of the spectrum is a company like my own, arguably the smallest North Sea oil company and yet one which would be strongly affected if the chancellor's proposals were to be implemented. Over several rounds of North Sea licensing Croft has built up a portfolio of exploration acreage, committing to the government to carry out certain seismic surveys and drilling. Our plans and commitments had been based on a fiscal regime in which our exploration and appraisal costs could be relieved against our PRT liability from the one producing field we have, Claymore. Under the chancellor's proposals the work we shall have to carry out under those commitments to government will effectively quadruple in cost. And, similarly, any discretionary exploration or appraisal work we might wish to carry out in the UK will be made that much more costly. Expressed another way, from 1996 when the PRT changes would begin to bite, our North Sea production revenue (and hence the money available for exploration) will halve. That is how a company largely devoted to exploration and appraisal will be affected. But certain other North Sea oil companies have such large producing interests and pay such large PRT bills that their effective increase in exploration and appraisal costs under the chancellor's proposals will be outweighed by the chancellor's other proposal, to reduce the PRT rate on existing fields from 75 to 50 per cent. Such companies, although few in number, are naturally rejoicing as your March 25 headline points out: 'BP defends oil tax from attacks.' Mr John Browne of BP is reported as saying that for too long the taxpayer has subsidised exploration. The reason he is now rejoicing is because the chancellor is proposing that in future the taxpayer will instead foot the bill for BP's increase in North Sea revenue, estimated at up to Pounds 140m a year. Mr Browne is one of the few North Sea oil company executives to consider exploration levels will not be seriously affected by the proposed changes, reportedly saying that instead it will give exploration a stronger focus and make it more cost-effective. If drilling success rates have declined from 1 in 5 to 1 in 7, as he says, it is not because of inefficient exploration but because with advancing maturity the North Sea is yielding smaller discoveries of which more are falling beneath the threshold of commercial viability. 'Stronger focus' is simply a euphemism for cutting the number of wells drilled, and fewer wells will mean fewer commercially viable discoveries. The government estimates that up to 25bn barrels of oil and 44 trillion cubic feet of gas may remain to be discovered in the UK. Finding those reserves will require sustained high levels of exploration. On the whole, over the past 30 years the fiscal regime has been conducive to such exploration - that could now change.

The agreement covers 20,000 sq km to the east of the Volga river between Saratov and Volgograd. Interneft, the Russian state oil exploration company, has drilled several promising exploration wells, but the area currently produces no oil. Before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Elf was negotiating for exploration rights on the Russian-Kazakhstan border. It expects to sign a deal with Kazakhstan before the end of February.

The press release also stated that the exploration cited  above and the potential commercial exploitation plan for that  area will be a continuation of the history of China's research  and exploration in that sea area, which began since time  immemorial, as far back as 200 years B.C.    In view of this matter, a spokesman for the SRV Foreign  Ministry gave the following remarks on 20 April:    Right from the time when the Creston Company signed a  contract on oil exploration and exploitation with the Chinese  Offshore Oil Company in May 1992, the SRV Foreign Ministry  issued a statement declaring that this contract is invalid and  that it constitutes a grave violation against Vietnam's  sovereignty over its continental shelf and economic zone as well  as against international law. The statement also pointed out  that according to international law, Vietnam has long exercised  its sovereignty over that area. As early as before 1975, this  area was divided into lots for bidding to conduct oil and gas  exploration and exploitation. The then Provisional  Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam also issued a  statement asserting its sovereignty. After the unification of  the country, the SRV Government issued its statements dated 12  May 1977 and 12 November 1984, asserting Vietnam's sovereignty  over its territorial seas and continental shelves. In 1988, the  Vietnamese side made public a chart of concession lots divided  for oil exploration and exploitation purposes. Vietnam has  since conducted exploration and exploitation of its oil and gas  resources in that area, including its cooperation with many  foreign companies. As decided by the SRV Government, an  economic, scientific, and service detachment has been  established there since 1989 with the presence of a system of  Vietnamese lighthouses and a hydro-meteorological station.    A seismological survey by the Creston Company and its  arrogant declaration of its planned oil exploration and  exploitation in the area within Vietnam's exclusive economic  zone and continental shelf -- an area which is, both legally and  practically, totally under Vietnamese sovereignty -- constitutes  a new, very grave step of escalation.    The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry once again asserted  that the contract of the Creston Company is invalid. Its  actions are illegal. No countries or companies will be allowed  to conduct any exploration or exploitation of natural resources  within Vietnam's continental shelf and exclusive economic zone  without permission from the Vietnamese Government. The Creston  Company will have to bear full responsibility for the  consequences arising from its actions.     "

0,FT931-9045 ,"FT931-9045 _AN-DBPBVAE6FT 930216   FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US gold explorers head south      By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent   LEADING US gold producers are cutting exploration spending at home while increasing it substantially in Latin America, according to a survey by the Gold Institute, a Washington-based, industry-financed organisation. Worldwide exploration spending by the 18 companies surveyed - which together accounted for 73 per cent of 1991 US gold output - fell by 16 per cent last year from Dollars 280m to an estimated Dollars 235m. Their gold exploration in the US fell by 18 per cent to a four-year low of Dollars 149m. This represented 63 per cent of total exploration budgets, down from 65 per cent in 1991 and 71 per cent as recently as 1989. 'This is the first time spending and share simultaneously declined - clear evidence that the US market is growing unattractive for investment,' the institute suggests. Meanwhile, exploration spending in Latin America, which was only Dollars 14m in 1989, increased by a further 16 per cent last year, from Dollars 30m to and estimated Dollars 35m. 'Latin American nations are taking deliberate and aggressive steps to recruit US investment. Mining is an internationally competitive business and capital will flow to those nations which have mineral wealth and offer an attractive business climate,' the institute says. It admits its survey excludes exploration work by small companies, prospectors and independent exploration companies - an important part of the business - but points out that 'the presence of a senior (big) gold producer in a given country is a sure sign that smaller companies have led the way'. The survey shows spending by US gold producers in Canada remained steady at an average of Dollars 27m a year or 10 to 11 per cent of exploration budgets. However, 'US producers appear to be wrapping up their efforts in Australia where spending (down from Dollars 14m in 1991 to an estimated Dollars 10m last year) and share (down from 5 per cent to 4.25 per cent) declined over the period of the survey'. In 1992 US producers cut spending in the rest of the world by 42 per cent to Dollars 15m. The survey will provide the US mining industry with ammunition as it battles against efforts being made in Congress to impose a national royalty on mineral production and other measures that the industry suggests would discourage investment in mining in the US. The institute points out that during the 1980s the US became the world's second-biggest gold producer and adds: 'As congressional and administration leaders consider measures to reform laws regulating this industry, they must carefully consider how their actions will affect the competitive position of the US'.

0," FR940722-0-00047   FR940722-0-00013        In a letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded that during the course of coal exploration, roads may be temporarily altered to leave established easements or rights-of-way and that the proposed definition of ``road'' at proposed NDCC 3812.103(6) includes those roads. North Dakota further stated that the ``surface'' used for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in coal exploration are subject to regulation, whether those vehicles are traveling within established rights-of-way or outside of them. Based upon the State's explanation, the Director finds that North Dakota's use of the word ``or'' in its proposed definition of ``road'' is not inconsistent with the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5.  Second, OSM requested that North Dakota clarify its intent regarding the differences between the proposed definition of ``road'' in the coal exploration portions of the State program and the already-approved definition of ``road'' in the surface coal mining and reclamation operations portions of the State program (NDAC 6905.20102(92)). Specifically, the approved definition of ``road'' at NDAC 6905.20102(92), like the Federal counterpart definition, explicitly includes access and haulroads constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in operations, including use by coal hauling vehicles to and from transfer, processing, or storage areas. Proposed NDCC 3812.103(6), however, does not contain a similar list of various types of roads encompassed by the definition.  By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that the proposed definition of ``road'' at NDCC 3812.103(6) includes all rights-of-way used in coal exploration and was not intended to include exhaustive examples of all types of roads. North Dakota also submitted a proposed revision to its coal exploration regulations at NDAC 43020120.3(c)(2). The revised regulation would include a new clause clarifying that:         A road is altered if it is constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way that causes the changes described in this section.         The Federal regulation defining ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5 insofar as it concerns coal exploration, also includes ``[a]ccess and haul roads constructed, used, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in *** coal exploration *** .'' Thus, North Dakota's inclusion of the additional terms ``constructed, reconstructed, improved, and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations at NDAC 43020120.3(c)(2), when read in conjunction with the discussion above regarding the proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 3812.103(6), effectively defines the term ``road'' to include all rights-of-way used in coal exploration as well as roads constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way. The Director finds that North Dakota has clarified OSM's concerns with respect to North Dakota's interpretation of its proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 3812.103(6) to ensure that it is consistent with the interpretation of the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5.  For the reasons discussed above, the Director finds that proposed NDCC 3812.103(6), defining the term ``road,'' and proposed NDAC 43020120.3(c)(2), that includes the additional clarifying terms ``constructed, reconstructed, improved, and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations, are in accordance and consistent with the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5. Accordingly, the Director is approving the proposed changes and is removing the required program amendment codified at 30 CFR 934.16(l).     "," FR940722-0-00047   FR940722-0-00013        In a letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded that during the course of coal exploration, roads may be temporarily altered to leave established easements or rights-of-way and that the proposed definition of ``road'' at proposed NDCC 3812.103(6) includes those roads. North Dakota further stated that the ``surface'' used for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in coal exploration are subject to regulation, whether those vehicles are traveling within established rights-of-way or outside of them. Based upon the State's explanation, the Director finds that North Dakota's use of the word ``or'' in its proposed definition of ``road'' is not inconsistent with the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5.  Second, OSM requested that North Dakota clarify its intent regarding the differences between the proposed definition of ``road'' in the coal exploration portions of the State program and the already-approved definition of ``road'' in the surface coal mining and reclamation operations portions of the State program (NDAC 6905.20102(92)). Specifically, the approved definition of ``road'' at NDAC 6905.20102(92), like the Federal counterpart definition, explicitly includes access and haulroads constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in operations, including use by coal hauling vehicles to and from transfer, processing, or storage areas. Proposed NDCC 3812.103(6), however, does not contain a similar list of various types of roads encompassed by the definition.  By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that the proposed definition of ``road'' at NDCC 3812.103(6) includes all rights-of-way used in coal exploration and was not intended to include exhaustive examples of all types of roads. North Dakota also submitted a proposed revision to its coal exploration regulations at NDAC 43020120.3(c)(2). The revised regulation would include a new clause clarifying that:         A road is altered if it is constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way that causes the changes described in this section.         The Federal regulation defining ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5 insofar as it concerns coal exploration, also includes ``[a]ccess and haul roads constructed, used, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in *** coal exploration *** .'' Thus, North Dakota's inclusion of the additional terms ``constructed, reconstructed, improved, and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations at NDAC 43020120.3(c)(2), when read in conjunction with the discussion above regarding the proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 3812.103(6), effectively defines the term ``road'' to include all rights-of-way used in coal exploration as well as roads constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way. The Director finds that North Dakota has clarified OSM's concerns with respect to North Dakota's interpretation of its proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 3812.103(6) to ensure that it is consistent with the interpretation of the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5.  For the reasons discussed above, the Director finds that proposed NDCC 3812.103(6), defining the term ``road,'' and proposed NDAC 43020120.3(c)(2), that includes the additional clarifying terms ``constructed, reconstructed, improved, and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations, are in accordance and consistent with the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5. Accordingly, the Director is approving the proposed changes and is removing the required program amendment codified at 30 CFR 934.16(l).     "

The result was after a write-off of Pounds 7.9m from unsuccessful exploration activities. Net profits for the first half of 1991 were Pounds 6.3m. However, the company decided from this year to write off the cost of failed exploration immediately on its profit and loss account, to give a fairer representation of its financial position. Successful exploration will continue to be capitalised and depreciated against eventual production. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said this was a 'half-way house' between full cost accounting, common among smaller oil companies, and successful efforts accounting, used by leading groups. Clyde wrote off the Pounds 7.9m costs of the withdrawal from Myanmar, where it drilled a dry hole. Mr Gourlay said earnings were in line with expectations given a 'historically low' oil price of Pounds 10.59 per barrel, down from Pounds 11.38 in 1991. Although production increased from 23,651 to 26,170 barrels of oil equivalent a day, turnover fell from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 43.7m. Mr Gourlay said that 'robust' cash inflow from operations of Pounds 26.7m demonstrated Clyde's underlying strength. Clyde hopes to increase production to about 39,000 b/d through development of the North Sea Gryphon field, expected to get government approval by the end of the year. It has also been buoyed by recent discoveries at Rhu, offshore Malaysia, and a new exploration award in Syria. Losses per share came through at 1.7p (2p earnings). Clyde confirmed it was suspending dividends to allow increased exploration spending. Analysts do not expect resumed pay-outs until Gryphon is well-established, in 1994 or 1995.

Woods watches seals, terns and whales in inhospitable waters      By MICHAEL J. WOODS   With hardly a sound, the sea lapped on to the shore of granite, ground to a silky smoothness by ice and water - itself blanketed by a layer of snow. Portly crab-eater seals lay enveloped in the folds of this fluffed and plumped duvet or sprawled on bluish ice floes carved and drawn like glass into delicate graceful shapes by the sea. Distant cliffs of rock and ice loomed through a mist of floating flakes of a soft shower of snow. Antarctic terns cried and hovered over a shoal of fish, diving and then swooping upwards on confident wings. But from a distance came the sudden roar of a collapsing ice cliff which, with immense force, sent a surge of waves sweeping into the bay, a timely reminder that Antarctica is far from placid and, even in the austral summer, can be fierce and inhospitable. I had come here to fulfil a childhood dream born out of Scott, Amundsen and Shackleton, nurtured by Edmund Hillary and Vivien Fuchs and given a final push by David Attenborough's BBC series, Life In The Freezer. From Punta Arenas in southern Chile our cruise ship, World Explorer, had navigated the Beagle Channel, rounded the Horn and then braved the Drake Passage, a two-day gauntlet run by every visitor to the Antarctic Peninsula. The gods had been kind, and we stole into the shelter of the South Shetland Islands with half a day in hand. This gave us time to slip into the Weddell Sea, gliding delicately between tabular icebergs which had calved from the ice shelf and were drifting slowly away from the continent. These flat-topped monoliths, like blocks of flats badly cast in concrete, towered high above the seven decks of the ship. That a further eight ninths plunged into the depths below was almost beyond comprehension. Although there were some on board who had no intention of going ashore, and others who simply wanted to tick off their final continent, many of the passengers told me that they really weren't 'cruise people.' They were there because the only way that Antarctica is readily accessible to ordinary visitors is by cruise ship. These not only provide comfortable accommodation with minimal impact on the environment, but visits to the shore by inflatable Zodiac can be more easily controlled. I happened to be on World Discoverer when it was undergoing its biennial check by an observer from the National Science Foundation who had come along to ensure that the cruise was being run in a safe way; that passengers were receiving both education and supervision with regard to the wildlife they were seeing; and that the operation was observing the guidelines set down by its own controlling body, the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (Iaato). This may sound dreadfully regimented and restrictive, but some constraints are clearly necessary as the numbers of visitors, to what amounts to only a tiny proportion of the continent, grows. Such controls are at their most extreme only when large numbers of passengers are ashore. As a result, the expedition leader's advice to take an early Zodiac ashore and catch the last one back was worth heeding. On one of my trips ashore I watched a mass of chin-strap penguins in an odoriferous rookery high on a stony hillside. There were birds feeding chicks, stealing pebbles from their neighbours' nests, preening, displaying or making their ponderous and squelchy way over dirty snow to and from the sea. On the shore below, a steaming heap of elephant seals wobbled irritably as one animal tried to burrow further into the pile. Occasionally things proved too much and a pair reared up, snorting and lunging, until honour was satisfied and the two brown blancmanges settled down once more. As we climbed aboard the last Zodiac to leave our final landfall at Port Lockroy, one of the guides spotted the blow of a humpback whale a short distance away, and we set off over the choppy water for a closer look. The three great mammals were in no hurry and lazed along on the surface, breathing noisily before arching their backs with utmost grace and sliding into the depths, lifting their tails clear of the water - called fluking - before disappearing with hardly a ripple. The Zodiac, which for a few seconds had been dwarfed by cetacean tails, erupted with elated cries. We followed the circular upwellings of water created by thrusts of their flukes, and were there when they resurfaced after just 3 1/2 minutes. Again they lazed on the surface; again they fluked. But time was passing and we had to return to the World Discoverer. Back on board, the mother ship began to shadow the whales. The sun was falling in a clear, pale blue sky and our position between the Antarctic Peninsula and several large islands felt as if we were sailing on a vast lake surrounded by the soaring spires of mountains, unnamed and unexplored, with dark, snow-dusted peaks piercing the huge iceflows. These, the product of decades of snow, clawed down the mountain sides and crumpled over folds in the underlying rock before calving chunks into the dark blue Antarctic Ocean. The great cetaceans had the muscle to outpace us had they wished, yet they continued on their leisurely way, fluking and diving to delighted cheers from the bows. It would be hard to think of a natural spectacle more magnificent than watching these massive mammals in a primeval landscape of such grandeur, so outside the human dimension as to be at once both humbling and awe-inspiring. Most of those on the ship - some were extremely well-travelled - were unlikely to experience a scene of such power and splendour anywhere else.

All-inclusive prices, including airfares, transfers, hotels where necessary, full board on the ship and insurance, start from Pounds 4,606 (1994-1995 season) for the 16-night cruise that Woods experienced (two departures: Dec 4 1994 and Jan 2 1995). Clipper will be operating a further six voyages to the Antarctic, taking in, additionally, the Falklands and South Georgia. World Discoverer handles a maximum of 138 passengers. Clothing: Clipper provides a padded parka but other items are essential. Thermal underwear as a base layer, and good quality fleece garments such as those made by Mountain Equipment (tel: 061-366-5020) as an intermediate layer, should be covered with a windproof outer shell. The parka is fine but Woods found a Goretex outer over a down jacket more flexible. Waterproof trousers and wellingtons are essential in the Zodiacs and for wet landings. Photography: take plenty of film as well as spare batteries, which are exhausted more quickly in the cold. A tripod is useful at the penguin rookeries and for the seals.

0,FT924-4643 ,"FT924-4643 _AN-CLACAAFUFT 921201   FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean group seeks joint venture partners      By LESLIE CRAWFORD      SANTIAGO   CODELCO, THE state-owned Chilean copper corporation, is seeking joint ventures with mining multinationals to explore four of its mining prospects. Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's planning director, said he would invite 20 mining companies this week to study the projects on offer. Two are copper deposits in the Atacama desert, and two are gold prospects close to La Coipa and El Hueso, gold mines already in operation. Mr Bande said these were the first of several prospects Codelco wanted to explore as joint-ventures, following the passage of recent legislation that authorised the state-owned company to forge partnerships with the private sector. Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, owns about a third of the registered mining property in Chile. Its exploration work, however, has been limited by budget constraints dictated by the finance ministry. Mr Bande sees the joint-ventures as a way of tapping the vast mineral potential that Codelco is unable to develop on its own. 'We are opening a whole field of exploration that was previously closed to the private-sector mining industry,' Mr Bande said. 'It will also allow Codelco to share the risk of exploration ventures.' Mr Bande did not name the mining companies that had been selected to consider the first four mining prospects. He would only say that they were companies already established in Chile with active exploration projects. They are being invited to bid for risk contracts. Codelco will effectively be a sleeping partner: it will offer its mining properties, while the partner will be responsible for meeting the costs of exploration work. This, Mr Bande said, would give Codelco's partners the right to acquire a share of the mining property if the deposits were judged to be worthy of commercial exploitation. Several mining multinationals in Chile have expressed an interest in teaming up with Codelco for exploration work. Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia, which operates the huge La Escondida copper mine in the Atacama desert, recently opened its offices for South America in Santiago. It has earmarked Dollars 3m a year for prospecting projects in Latin America, just under half of which will be spent in Chile. Mr Jose Cabello, BHP's explorations manager, said he hoped his company would be included in Codelco's list of potential partners. Placer Dome and Falconbridge of Canada are also locating their exploration headquarters for Latin America in Santiago, supporting Chile's claim to being the top country for mining exploration in the region.

0,FT941-3065 ,"FT941-3065 _AN-ECQDGAGCFT 940317   FT  17 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: The glittering prize that was almost overlooked - Kenneth Gooding talks to the British-born lady geologist who in 1972 found Australia's first diamond      By KENNETH GOODING   Companies scrambling to take part in Australia's biggest diamond exploration boom for many years owe a great debt to Ms Maureen Muggeridge. This British-born geologist earned a place in geological history when she found Australia's first diamond in 1972 - before that many experts believed there were no diamonds to be found in the country, despite its huge size, because the geology was wrong. She was also part of the team that seven years later located the Argyle AK1 deposit in the far north of Western Australia, one of the country's most important mineral discoveries and now the world's largest diamond producer, at least in terms of the weight. Ms Muggeridge, now 46, was born in Croydon, near London, and is the niece of the late Mr Malcolm Muggeridge, the eccentric British writer. She spent her childhood in Nigeria and earned her geology degree at St Andrew's University, Glasgow. She recalls she then set out for Australia 'to get some sunshine unquote'. She was given a job by Tanganyika Holdings, which then was the only company seriously exploring for diamonds in Australia, apart from, inevitably, De Beers, the South African group which dominates the industry, via its subsidiary Stockdale. Tanganyika was eventually absorbed by CRA, one of Australia's big mining groups and one capable of finding the large sums required to finance a diamond mine. Ms Muggeridge recalls that the vital clues to the massive Argyle deposit were nearly missed. 'I was a bit pushy and insisted we leave no gaps in the exploration work.' So with only one geologist assistant she set out in a helicopter on what proved to be an immensely profitable sortie for CRA. One consolation was that her assistant on that trip was Mr John Towie, now a director of rival Australian diamond exploration group, Triad Minerals, whom she had then just wed. The 38 diamond grains in the sample they sent back for testing could have fitted easily on the head of a match. Once those traces had been found, however, it was an easy task to trace them back to the Argyle deposit. 'Searching for diamonds is much worse than looking for a needle in a haystack,' says Ms Muggeridge. 'At least you can burn down the haystack and use a metal detector. Success in diamond exploration depends heavily on the expertise of the people involved and, because diamonds and their host rocks are so rare, they are extremely hard to find and a long term approach is an absolute necessity.' For the past five years she has been exploration director of Moonstone Diamond Corporation, which last November raised ADollars 5m (USDollars 3.6m) on the Australian Stock Exchange, enough for two year's exploration work. Ms Muggeridge was among the speakers at the first Australian Diamond Conference here in Perth last week. The standing room only event was one indication of how diamond fever has taken hold in Western Australia. Another came from Mr Michael Thomson of stockbrokers Eyres Reed when he estimated that in the past year diamond exploration companies in Australia had raised at least ADollars 72m. As usual in mining booms, many of the companies involved are as interested in bulling up their share prices as in looking for gem stones. This has led to some unease and complaints, particularly about the way some report their exploration results - so far no set procedures have been fixed for this. At the conference Mr Wolf Marx, convener of the diamond reporting committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, read from a number of recent explorers' reports that left out crucial information such as the value of diamonds found or referred to values or even connotations of value (such as 'gem' or 'near gem') of a small number of diamonds that were potentially misleading. 'Diamond exploration geologists, exploration managers and even chairmen of mining companies are unlikely to have sufficient expertise to give accurate assessments of diamond values,' he explained. 'This is made worse if the stones are micro diamonds which, by definition, cannot be considered to have any value other than scientific.' Delegates cheered up, however, when Mr Chris Jennings, an international explorer associated with the discoveries in the North West Territories that caused Canada's recent diamond rush, said new technical expertise and knowledge justified more exploration in Australia, including in those areas already studied for diamonds. 'Since Argyle there has been no intense exploration in Australia,' he said. 'There are probably big areas where there is some sort of potential for diamonds - I feel confident about it.' Nevertheless, finding those diamonds will not be easy. Mr Yannic Mercier, Geneva-based chairman of Ms Muggeridge's Moonstone Corporation, jokingly told delegates that when he was first invited to invest he replied: 'Setting up a diamond exploration company raises only two questions; how much money you want to lose and how long will you give yourself to lose it'.

The government signed 22 production sharing contracts with oil companies in 1991, up from 14 in each of the previous two years, and the report estimates a further 15 could be signed this year. However, only 123 exploration wells drilled last year, 38.5 per cent below the number forecast by Pertamina, the state-owned oil and gas company. Actual exploration and development expenditure by oil companies was Dollars 1.875bn, significantly lower than the Dollars 2.27bn budgeted. The report cautions that oil companies are farming out exploration in frontier areas, where the cost of a wildcat well exceeds Dollars 30m, in order to limit exposure. Pertamina forecasts that oil companies' exploration expenditure will reach Dollars 2.84bn this year, although the report says the softness of the oil market may lead to 'some erosion in budgeted outlays'. The report estimates Indonesia's crude and condensate production in 1991 at 1.592m barrels a day, dropping to 1.53m b/d in the first quarter of this year. Exports in 1991 averaged 905,000 b/d, of which 44 per cent went to Japan and 11 per cent to the US. The value of Indonesia's oil and condensate exports last year totalled Dollars 6.4bn, down from Dollars 8.75bn in 1990. Indonesia also produced 22m tonnes of liquefied natural gas last year, accounting for 38 per cent of world production. All production was exported, with Japan accounting for 80 per cent, South Korea 13 per cent and Taiwan 7 per cent. LNG exports in 1991 were valued at Dollars 4.04bn.

According to a survey by the Metals Economics Group of Canada, RTZ expected to spend USDollars 100m on grassroots exploration in 1991 whereas Anglo budgeted Dollars 102m. When associated companies are taken into account, the RTZ group budget was Dollars 200m compared with Anglo's Dollars 221m. The Anglo spending includes Dollars 60m by its De Beers diamond associate, Dollars 22m by Minorco, its overseas investment arm, and Dollars 12m by Gold Fields of South Africa, which MEG includes because of Anglo's 25.9 per cent shareholding in GFSA. Nine companies are listed in the RTZ group, including CRA of Australia, which budgeted Dollars 86m exploration spending for last year. Other big exploration spenders last year included Canada's Noranda, with a budgeted Falconbridge) and the 11 companies knit into the combine comprised of MIM, Asarco, Cominco, Teck and Metallgesellschaft,which between them expected to spend Dollars 125m. Placer Dome budgeted to spend Dollars 60m, as did the Anglovaal group. BHP was scheduled to spend Dollars 54m on non-ferrous metals exploration, Newmont Mining Dollars 50m and Western Mining Dollars 44m. MEG says the Hanson conglomerate's US gold subsidiary, Gold Fields Mining Corporation, expected to maintain its exploration budget at Dollars 17m. The survey covered 153 mining companies with annual exploration budgets of more than Dollars 1m. MEG estimates these accounted for 80 per cent of all worldwide spending on non-ferrous metals exploration (the survey excludes iron ore, bauxite, coal or oil and gas exploration). It says there was an 8 per cent fall in expenditure by the companies surveyed compared with 1990. Of the Dollars 1.8bn total, Dollars 430m was directed to projects in Canada, Dollars 353m to Australia and Dollars 341m to the US. MEG points out that, although it is still attracting most spending, Canada's exploration level has fallen sharply from 1987 and 1988 when favourable tax treatment for investors boosted spending to more than Dollars 1bn in each year. US expenditures have remained relatively stable but Australian spending has fallen steadily since 1987. Rough estimates put spending in South Africa at Dollars 245m, in South America at Dollars 200m, the south Pacific region at Dollars 125m, Europe at Dollars 80m and Africa outside South Africa at Dollars 70m. Gold exploration attracted more than Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent of total spending while base metals exploration, having recovered from the depressed levels of the mid-1980s, accounted for 31 per cent. MEG says: 'Many of the major companies have kept up a relatively constant base metals exploration effort from year to year, but smaller companies are now joining in as the low gold price continues to dampen investor interest in gold.

The company, which will be one of the hardest hit in the North Sea by proposed rules on petroleum revenue tax, said it would also pull out of many applications for government licences to explore in the UK. 'This is not an idle threat, we are doing what is necessary to survive,' said Mr Sam Laidlaw, managing director of Amerada, the UK arm of the international US oil company. Mr Laidlaw said that, even with its plans to cut exploration by 50 per cent, its profit level will still suffer. Last week, Mr Norman Lamont announced that the rate of petroleum revenue tax for existing fields in the North Sea will be cut from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. But more importantly, for companies such as Amerada, he abolished PRT relief on the costs of oil exploration and appraisal. North Sea operators estimate that the cost of exploring will quadruple as a result of the Budget changes. Mr Harold Hughes, head of the UK Offshore Operators' Association, said: 'The proposals represent a major disincentive to future exploration activity which is the life blood of the North Sea.' A group of oil experts including several exploration directors of leading oil companies have written to newspapers denouncing the chancellor's tax changes. Amerada said the new regime would cut profits from Pounds 2 a barrel to 10p a barrel for a small discovery such as its Angus field, estimated to contain 10m barrels of oil. 'The profit under the old regime was pretty small. No one would contemplate developing a field for 10p a barrel and this is the future life-blood of the North Sea,' Mr Laidlaw said. The new UK regime would make Norway and Australasia more attractive prospects. The company is considering job cuts in its exploration department and laying off two rigs which it had contracted. Mr Laidlaw estimated that the industry could lose several thousand jobs in the short term and more over the longer term as a result of the new PRT rules. Mr Laidlaw said Amerada would pull out of applications it had already made to the Department of Trade and Industry for licences to drill some North Sea blocks. Mr Richard Hardman, Amerada's exploration director, said the company would probably drill four wells next year as opposed to eight or 10 under the existing tax regime. Overall, he estimated that companies would drill 80 to 100 wells in the North Sea this year compared with 130 last year. The DTI is expected to announce results of the 14th licensing round in May. Applicant companies must commit to drill a certain number of wells within a particular time - since these will now not be eligible for tax relief, many companies are reassessing their commitments. Mr Laidlaw is lobbying for changes in the PRT proposals, arguing that only one or two large companies in the North Sea would be net beneficiaries of the new rules.

Even though the country was very well-endowed with copper, gold and other minerals, it had been left behind when the rest of the world was experiencing a gold-driven exploration boom. This presented mining companies with 'a window of opportunity which no longer exists in many parts of the world'. The Philippines had missed out mainly because of the political instability associated with President Marcos's removal from power. Mr Robbins said there had been no systematic, grass roots exploration since the early 1970s since when significant advances had been made in technology. He was speaking at a seminar in London on to mining opportunities in the Philippines and organised by the United Nations' Department of Technical Co-operation for Development, and Mining Journal. Mr Robbins said that, despite the lack of recent exploration activity, the country remained among the world's big metals producers, ranking eighth in gold, tenth in copper and sixth in chromite. The country also had deposits of nickel, iron, lead, zinc, platinum, manganese, molybdenum, cobalt, aluminium and mercury. However, although Western Mining was exploring in the Philippines in preference to Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, there were disadvantages. Most important was that it was enshrined in the constitution that Filipino companies had to be 60 per cent domestically-owned. 'The result is that in the Philippines the foreign investor has to carry all the risk and all the costs and only receive 40 per cent of the prize if the exploration is successful,' he said. However, a strong body of responsible opinion in the country recognised the detrimental impact of the ownership rule and he hoped the new government would change it after the May elections.

The deal boosts Enterprise's net acreage on the Norwegian Continental Shelf by 25 per cent, or 298 sq km, and gives the company a 50 per cent stake in each of the three blocks within the Esso licenses. Domestic analysts said they believed the deal to be the biggest of its kind ever concluded in Norway. Enterprise said that portions of blocks 16/1, 25/8 and 25/20 in the Utsira High area with proven hydrocarbons were specifically excluded from the farm-in. The company explained that it had agreed the farm-in with Esso to make greater and faster progress in building its Norwegian North Sea portfolio than what otherwise could be accomplished under Norway's licensing regime. Enterprise intends to drill three exploration wells - one this year in block 25/8 near Esso's producing Balder field - and to undertake three dimensional seismic surveys over the bulk of the farm-in acreage. Including the farm-in well, the company plans to drill up to 10 exploration wells this year elsewhere on Norwegian shelf acreage, or one-third of all wells to be drilled in the sector, representing its heaviest ever exploration programme since entering Norway in 1989, when it acquired acreage from Texas Eastern. The two companies have already secured approval of the agreement by Norway's industry and energy ministry and finance ministry.   Companies:-  Enterprise Oil Norge.

The result was after a write-off of Pounds 7.9m from unsuccessful exploration activities. Net profits for the first half of 1991 were Pounds 6.3m. However, the company decided from this year to write off the cost of failed exploration immediately on its profit and loss account, to give a fairer representation of its financial position. Successful exploration will continue to be capitalised and depreciated against eventual production. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said this was a 'half-way house' between full cost accounting, common among smaller oil companies, and successful efforts accounting, used by leading groups. Clyde wrote off the Pounds 7.9m costs of the withdrawal from Myanmar, where it drilled a dry hole. Mr Gourlay said earnings were in line with expectations given a 'historically low' oil price of Pounds 10.59 per barrel, down from Pounds 11.38 in 1991. Although production increased from 23,651 to 26,170 barrels of oil equivalent a day, turnover fell from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 43.7m. Losses per share came through at 1.7p (2p earnings). Clyde confirmed it was suspending dividends to allow increased exploration spending.  The Financial Times   London Page 25  "
0,FT931-2746 ,"FT931-2746 _AN-DCRCHAF0FT 930318   FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Oil equities knocked by tax reforms      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   OIL COMPANY shares were hit yesterday as the City reacted to news of the most significant overhaul to North Sea taxation in 10 years, an-nounced in Tuesday's Budget. The complexity of the tax changes means there will be substantial winners and losers. British Petroleum is one of the main beneficiaries from the new regime and its share price rose 6.5 per cent between the market close on Monday and the close last night. But some of the smaller exploration companies saw their shares fall - Clyde Petroleum and Hardy Oil and Gas were down 11 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Mr David Simon, chief executive of BP, said the reduction in the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent was 'a long-sought and fundamental structural reform'. City analysts estimate that BP will add between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m to its profits from the tax change. But Shell sounded a note of caution. Mr John Collins, chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, said: 'The inability to charge exploration and appraisal expenditure against income from PRT-paying fields puts a downward pressure on exploration and appraisal activity.' This is by far the most controversial part of Mr Norman Lamont's announcement. It will mean oil companies paying 64p of every pound invested, compared with 17p and could substantially reduce exploration activity, hitting smaller companies hardest. Mr John Walmesley, finance director of Enterprise Oil, said: 'The changes have taken away a lot of the incentive to re-invest your earnings in new projects in the North Sea.' Although Enterprise stands to gain from the tax overhaul, Mr Walmesley said the changes meant that oil operators, already suffering from low oil prices and high costs will reduce their exploration work. Mr Kenneth Waters, finance director of Goal Petroleum, one of the smaller exploration and production companies, said: 'We have to review our whole strategy as a result of these changes and we will look at putting more of our money overseas.' Mr Paul Zatz, finance director of Clyde Petroleum, said the company was already directing much of its investment overseas, particularly to the Netherlands. 'It will inevitably mean a drop-off in future activity in the North Sea.' The PRT rate reduction gives larger companies an incentive to extract more barrels from existing oilfields - an important boost at a time when many fields are nearing depletion. Mr Simon said this could raise the recoverable reserves and extend the productive life of some oilfields. Some industry analysts fear, however, that the government will kill off exploration in new areas of the North Sea, such as the west of Shetland region where it is costly to drill for oil. BP has just made a large discovery west of Shetland which was hailed as opening up a completely new offshore oil province. Mr Simon said yesterday the tax changes would help develop the discovery, where a higher rate of return was necessary. But analysts believe other companies could be deterred from becoming involved.

Amoco said it planned to spend Dollars 3.2bn on capital investment and exploration next year, a budget that is largely unchanged on the spending level authorised for this year. Some Dollars 1.85bn of this amount will be devoted to exploration and production, of which 70 per cent, or some Dollars 1.3bn, will be outside the United States. Last year, the company spent Dollars 1.275bn on exploration and production overseas. A growing number of US oil and gas companies have decided recently redirect exploration efforts away from the US. This trend results partly from congressional and local restrictions on drilling offshore of Florida and California and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Last July, Amoco announced cost-cutting plans to take an Dollars 800m restructuring charge in the second quarter and to reduce its workforce by 8,500 employees, or 16 per cent, by the end of next year.

Egypt has advised all international oil companies that Sudan has no authority to sign exploration agreements for acreage north of their 'political' boundary delineated by latitude 22 degrees north under an 1899 treaty. Egypt was reacting to an agreement signed last month between Sudan and the Canadian-registered International Petroleum Corporation for seismic work in waters north of 22 degrees in an area Egypt claims as sovereign territory. Sudan, however, believes an 'administrative' boundary, agreed in 1902, which runs north of the political boundary, entitles it to allow exploration north of 22 degrees. The dispute could hardly come at a more awkward moment, with relations between moderate rulers in Cairo and the Islamicist-dominated military regime in Sudan under severe strain. It also coincides with reports of recent troubles between Egyptian and Sudanese patrols in the triangle formed by the 'political' and 'administrative' boundaries. The 'political' boundary came into effect with the Anglo-Egyptian condominium agreement of 1899. It was followed three years later by an amendment that gave Sudan administrative responsibility for tribes north of 1899 boundary in the east. Egypt was given responsibility for a small section south of the line about half-way between the Red Sea coast and the Nile. It is unclear whether the 'political' or 'administrative' boundaries have international boundary status. This issue may in the end require international jurisdiction. In the meantime Egypt, which is keen to promote offshore exploration in the Red Sea, is offering a large block which runs south to its 'political' boundary with Sudan, and in fact includes acreage targeted for exploration by International Petroleum. In Geneva, International Petroleum said it was planning to go ahead with its seismic survey in its 10,000 square kilometre Halaib block. A spokesman said that until the Egyptians had complained he had not been aware that the area was in dispute. Egypt, through its embassy in Ottawa, informed the Canadian government, and through it International Petroleum, that it regarded exploration in waters off the area under dispute latitude as 'illegal.' In Cairo, a spokesman for the Canadian embassy said the issue was under discussion with both Egypt and Sudan. He said the Sudanese were insisting they had a right to enter into exploration a greements for areas in their 'administrative' zone.  The Financial Times   London Page 4 Map (Omitted).  "

Some IPounds 27m of the losses, or 90 per cent, are the result of the disposal last August of the company's Colombian oilfield interests to Coplex Resources, an Australian exploration company, for IPounds 5.6m in a cash and share deal. Mr Duncan McGregor, who recently replaced Mr Neil O'Donoghue as Tuskar's chairman, explained that the loss was due to deferred exploration expenditure in the Rubiales oilfield in Colombia which had been held in the books. That loss was realised upon disposal of the field to Coplex, he said. In its 1991 annual report, the company reported a total of IPounds 29.5m deferred expenditure relating to its Colombian exploration licences. A further IPounds 1.23m has been written off in exploration expenditure, primarily in the UK and Turkey and there was a IPounds 1.29m loss on the sale of its investment in Tuskar (Texas). In April this year, Tuskar entered into a share-swap deal with Coplex to dispose of 54 per cent of its Colombian acreage, following a takeover bid by Coplex. The bid was rejected by shareholders, and led to the revised deal under which all of Tuskar's interests in the Piriales field were sold in August to Coplex. The company's shares, which trade on the USM, were then suspended at 1p. Losses per share increased to 11.71p (4.06p).  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

The western world's big mining groups will spend about Dollars 96.4m less on exploration this year than they did in 1991 - which itself showed a Dollars 122.8m decrease on the previous year - according to Metal Economics Group, a Canadian research organisation. It says in a new report that gold this year is attracting Dollars 839m or 52 per cent of total spending by the 158 companies that provided this information. This is down from more than Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent of the total in 1991. In 1989, when the gold price was much higher than at present, gold exploration spending at Dollars 1.2bn reached 68 per cent of the total. On the other hand, says MEG, budget shares devoted to base metals exploration have increased steadily during the past few years. Base metals and/or polymetallics programmes are attracting Dollars 525m this year, or 32.6 per cent of the surveyed total, compared with Dollars 576m in 1991, or 31 per cent, and only Dollars 305m or 18 per cent in 1989. Expenditures for other metals and minerals - primarily diamonds, titanium-bearing and other industrial minerals and platinum - are also rising, with Dollars 248m being spent this year (15.4 per cent of the surveyed total) compared with Dollars 242m or 13 per cent last year. The exploration budgets of the 161 companies world-wide that were surveyed total Dollars 1.7bn. The US still attracts most of the spending, taking 21.4 per cent, followed by Australia (19.1 per cent), Canada (17.8 per cent) and Latin America (15.1 per cent). Mining companies' growing interest in Latin America is reflected in the fact that exploration expenditure there is scheduled to rise by 28 per cent this year. Spending in the US is up by 6.5 per cent but it is down in Canada and in Australia by 30 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. Eleven companies in the RTZ Group, the world's biggest mining company, are spending about Dollars 209m, according to MEG's calculations.

The public is expressing indignation  over the attitude of the Crestone energy company and its actions  because of the following reasons:    First, the sea area where Crestone is conducting the  seismologial survey is precisely the Tu Chinh coral reef of  Vietnam. This area lies within Vietnam's sacred terrorial sea.  By arrogantly conducting a survey in this area, Crestone has  brazenly and gravely violated Vietnamese sovereignty, thus  tramping on international justice and law, provoking public  opinion, and running counter to the trend of our time which,  promoted by the world community, calls for the respect of the  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of every  country.    Second, the U.S.-owned Crestone company deliberately  distorted the truth and the history to cover up its wrongdoing.  It claimed that its action is a continuation of China's history  of research and exploration in that sea area, which allegedly  began since time immemorial as far back as 200 years B.C.    In view of the wrongful attitude and action of Crestone, we  express our great indignation over the company's action and  denounce it before the public.    Right from the time when the company signed an oil  exploration and exploitation contract with the Offshore Oil  Company of China in May 1992, the SRV Foreign Ministry had  issued a statement declaring that this contract is invalid and  that it constitutes a grave violation against Vietnam's  sovereignty over its continental shelf and economic zone as well  as against international law.    We assert that according to international law, Vietnam has  long exercised its sovereignty over the Tu Chinh area. As early  as before 1975, this area was divided into bid lots for oil and  gas exploration and exploitation. The then Provisional  Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam also issued a  statement asserting its sovereignty. After the unification of  the country, the SRV Government issued its statements dated 12  May 1977 and 12 November 1982, asserting Vietnam's sovereignty  over its territorial seas and continental shelves. In 1988, the  Vietnamese side made public a chart of concession lots divided  for oil exploration and exploitation purposes. Vietnam has  since conducted exploration and exploitation of its oil and gas  resources in that area, including its cooperation with many  foreign companies. As decided by the SRV Government, an  economic, scientific, and service zone has been established  there since 1989 with the presence of a system of Vietnamese  lighthouses and a hydro-meteorological station.    On 20 April 1994, a spokesman for the SRV Government again  clearly pointed out that the seismological survey by the  Crestone company and its arrogant declaration of a planned  exploration and exploitation of national resources in the area  within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and continental shelf  -- an area which is, both legally and practically, totally under  Vietnamese sovereignty -- constitutes a new, very grave step of  escalation; and that the Crestone company must bear full  responsibility for the consequences arising from its actions.    Once again, we asserted that the contract of the Crestone  company is invalid and that its actions are illegal. No  countries or companies will be allowed to conduct any  exploration or exploitation of natural resources within  Vietnam's continental shelf and exclusive economic zone without  permission from the Vietnamese Government.

0,FT941-1932 ,"FT941-1932 _AN-ECWDJAETFT 940323   FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Clyde Petroleum cuts loss to Pounds 23.4m      By PEGGY HOLLINGER   Clyde Petroleum, the lossmaking oil and gas exploration company, yesterday warned that a return to profitability was uncertain as long as the oil price remained at historically low levels. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said that in a climate of weak oil prices, a return to profit and to the dividend list depended on two main factors: the speed at which Clyde could build up production and the level of exploration write-offs. This latter factor, which writes off unsuccessful exploration as incurred, was 'unpredictable,' said Mr Gourlay. The group was seeking to reduce the exposure to such factors by reining in exploration. Expenditure on new pros-pects was Pounds 18m last year, against Pounds 30m previously. Clyde was further reducing exploration investment to Pounds 10m this year. The group spent Pounds 93.6m on development, against Pounds 17.46m last time. Some Pounds 36m was budgeted for development this year. Clyde reported lower net losses of Pounds 23.4m for the year to December 31, against a Pounds 39.8m deficit last time. Sales were 2 per cent lower at Pounds 81.6m. The company enjoyed a series of one-off gains which helped to reduce losses. These included an Pounds 8.3m fall in exploration costs to Pounds 34m, a tax clawback of Pounds 5m, and lower provisions of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 11m) on the carrying value of assets. The company also benefited from the hedging of 80 per cent of its production at an Dollars 18 oil price. Some 24 per cent of this year's output was hedged at Dollars 17, Mr Gourlay said. Clyde expected to increase production by 60 per cent this year, largely because of the inclusion for a full year of output from the North Sea Gryphon field. Last year Clyde staged a Pounds 34m rights issue to develop this field. 'At the moment we are disappointed that benefit comes in juxtaposition with a historically low oil price,' Mr Gourlay said. Analysts greeted the results with a certain degree of resignation. Borrowings of Pounds 188.7m, representing 110 per cent of shareholders' funds, remained higher than expected. The group was also not showing a great deal of success in the exploration carried out to date, even though it has been attempting to reduce the risk through farming out interests. As in previous years, there was no dividend. Losses per share were halved to 6.2p. Proven and probable reserves fell by 8 per cent to 164.4m barrels of oil equivalent.

""China  has irrefutable sovereignety over the Nansha Islands (Spratlys)  and its adjacent waters,"" a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP.  ""Any country's exploration and exploitation activities of oil  and gas there should not damage"" China's interests, he added.    The comment came in reply to a question on the Philippines  allowing Alcorn Petroleum and Minerals Corp. and U.S. partner  Vaalco Energy Inc. to begin preliminary exploration work near  the disputed South China Sea chain. Philippine energy officials  insisted Tuesday the area where the exploration would be  conducted is not part of the Spratlys -- a chain of atolls in  the South China Sea claimed wholly by China and in part by  Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.    The Spratlys are believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil  and natural gas and also straddle strategic sea lanes. Two  other U.S. firms, Crestone Energy Corp. and Mobil are already  exploring part of the area on behalf of the Chinese and  Vietnamese governments respectively. Both governments  vehemently criticised each other's moves.     "

It will be the first international tender of its kind by Cuba, which has suffered severe oil shortages since the collapse of its preferential trade links with the former Soviet Union. The Cuban state oil company Cubapetroleo (Cupet) announced that the tender inviting bids would be officially presented in Calgary and London on February 10 and 17 respectively. On offer for production sharing contracts were seven onshore and three offshore blocks, with one block straddling land and sea. Foreign oil companies had until August 1 to present their bids. A British company, Simon Petroleum Technology, would help organise the tender. Cupet officials said the blocks were in various parts of the island, including one in the western province of Pinar del Rio and another in south-eastern Granma province. These were areas which were either unexplored or where past exploration data were now out of date, the officials said. A second tender offering more exploration blocks was planned for later. Over the past two years, Cuba has awarded contracts for seven exploration blocks.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.   Industries:-  P1311  Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

One-off charges of Dollars 145m - mainly related to the rise in the US corporate tax rate - led to a fall in net income to Dollars 420m, or Dollars 1.29 a share, from Dollars 467m or Dollars 1.37 a share the year before. Before special items, net income in both periods jumped to Dollars 565m from Dollars 410m. US refining and marketing income climbed to Dollars 164m, from Dollars 69m, while earnings overseas were up from Dollars 19m to Dollars 50m. Lower oil prices accounted for most of the improvement. Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief operating officer, said the company had cut operating expenses by 14 per cent over the past two years, equivalent to a saving of Dollars 1 a barrel. US exploration and production income fell to Dollars 125m from Dollars 251m as higher natural gas prices failed to make up for a Dollars 3.94 fall in the price realised for a barrel of oil. Unocal, the Los Angeles-based energy group, lifted its third-quarter earnings to Dollars 70m or 25 cents a share from Dollars 11m or 1 cent a year ago, boosted by improved West Coast refining and marketing operations, Reuter reports. Higher domestic natural gas prices, lower worldwide exploration expense and lower interest expense contributed to the improved results. The quarter included a Dollars 14m charge on the effect of the higher federal tax rate on deferred taxes. The 1992 quarter included a Dollars 32m restructuring charge. Third-quarter operating earnings from petroleum exploration and production fell to Dollars 101m from Dollars 121m in 1992, reflecting lower worldwide crude oil prices and production.

There the icy air is light to the lungs and offers magical  transparency to the sight. The hours of bewitching quietness and of total sun  are swept away by raging blizzards that spare intruders only by chance.    This immense austral land is buried under mountains of snow, piled up and  frozen over the course of tens of millions of years. Fossils, the vestiges of  important chapters in our planet's history, sleep under their immaculate  shroud. All around circles a silent carrousel of giant icebergs that have been  torn from the shores, and dwarf lichens sprinkle the coast ice with hesitant  spots of color. A fringe of salty ice protrudes, then disappears with seasons,  while on land soft ice melts only to better solidify.    The sea sometimes reddens with clouds of tiny shrimp -- krill -- on which  penguins, whales and, indirectly, seals stuff themselves in order to survive.  The seals move about under the pack ice while singing eerie melodies; a fish --  the icefish -- injects proteins as antifreeze into its colorless blood; the  orcas, endowed with majestic fins, blend their breath with the morning mist.    Antarctica, continent at the bottom of the world, has shown us its fragile  state, which is due to the extreme simplicity of its ecosystems. But the  forbidding rigor of its environment did not discourage some territorial claims  that the 1959 Antarctic treaty has thus far managed to include. The document,  signed by 12 nations and now honored by 26 others, ensures the demilitarization  of Antarctica and lays great stress on its use for scientific research.    Already whales have been hunted, and more recent tentative agreements  (particularly that of April 7, 1982) have begun opening the way to industrial  fishing for krill. Such hypocritical infringements on the spirit that  enthusiastically gave birth to the Antarctic treaty -- namely the willingness  to preserve the last wilderness zone on our planet -- caused us to sound a  first cry of alarm in 1984.    Alas, this time, masks have fallen. Representatives of 33 countries, assembled  in Wellington, New Zealand, have, after six years of difficult negotiations,  signed an agreement that opens the entire Antarctic continent to a so-called  controlled exploitation of its mining resources: coal, uranium, gold and oil.    The document even specifies that prospecting by means of seismic explosion of a  ""reasonable magnitude"" is permitted. The cold? The ice? It will be difficult?  It will be costly? What does it matter!? Since it is possible, exult the  technocrats, it will be done! What? Dust from coal and smoke from oil torches  are going to alter the protective whiteness of the surface, the albedo of the  entire continent? The ice may melt; the sea may rise several dozen feet and  engulf most of our cities? Come, come now! More ecologists' tales!    Hardly. We need only take the example of the Bahia Paraiso, the Argentine  supply ship that ran aground in January off Palmer Station, a crucial U.S.  scientific base. The diesel-fuel cargo leaked slowly, over a matter of days,  but 20 years of scientific research was compromised before clean-up vessels  could even reach the spill.    Oil-coated seabirds and smothered plankton -- microscopic sea creatures being  studied in experiments to gauge how increased ultraviolet sunlight will effect  the ocean surface. Accidental pollution had finally stained the laboratory of  Antarctica. It was a ""minor"" oil spill, authorities said, but the local  consequences to the fragile ecosystem will take years, if ever, to recoup.    If an innocent ship with an innocent purpose can cause potential catastrophe,  what of mining operations?

There the icy air is light to the lungs and offers magical  transparency to the sight. The hours of bewitching quietness and of total sun  are swept away by raging blizzards that spare intruders only by chance.    This immense austral land is buried under mountains of snow, piled up and  frozen over the course of tens of millions of years. Fossils, the vestiges of  important chapters in our planet's history, sleep under their immaculate  shroud. All around circles a silent carrousel of giant icebergs that have been  torn from the shores, and dwarf lichens sprinkle the coast ice with hesitant  spots of color. A fringe of salty ice protrudes, then disappears with seasons,  while on land soft ice melts only to better solidify.    The sea sometimes reddens with clouds of tiny shrimp -- krill -- on which  penguins, whales and, indirectly, seals stuff themselves in order to survive.  The seals move about under the pack ice while singing eerie melodies; a fish --  the icefish -- injects proteins as antifreeze into its colorless blood; the  orcas, endowed with majestic fins, blend their breath with the morning mist.    Antarctica, continent at the bottom of the world, has shown us its fragile  state, which is due to the extreme simplicity of its ecosystems. But the  forbidding rigor of its environment did not discourage some territorial claims  that the 1959 Antarctic treaty has thus far managed to include. The document,  signed by 12 nations and now honored by 26 others, ensures the demilitarization  of Antarctica and lays great stress on its use for scientific research.    Already whales have been hunted, and more recent tentative agreements  (particularly that of April 7, 1982) have begun opening the way to industrial  fishing for krill. Such hypocritical infringements on the spirit that  enthusiastically gave birth to the Antarctic treaty -- namely the willingness  to preserve the last wilderness zone on our planet -- caused us to sound a  first cry of alarm in 1984.    Alas, this time, masks have fallen. Representatives of 33 countries, assembled  in Wellington, New Zealand, have, after six years of difficult negotiations,  signed an agreement that opens the entire Antarctic continent to a so-called  controlled exploitation of its mining resources: coal, uranium, gold and oil.    The document even specifies that prospecting by means of seismic explosion of a  ""reasonable magnitude"" is permitted. The cold? The ice? It will be difficult?  It will be costly? What does it matter!? Since it is possible, exult the  technocrats, it will be done! What? Dust from coal and smoke from oil torches  are going to alter the protective whiteness of the surface, the albedo of the  entire continent? The ice may melt; the sea may rise several dozen feet and  engulf most of our cities? Come, come now! More ecologists' tales!    Hardly. We need only take the example of the Bahia Paraiso, the Argentine  supply ship that ran aground in January off Palmer Station, a crucial U.S.  scientific base. The diesel-fuel cargo leaked slowly, over a matter of days,  but 20 years of scientific research was compromised before clean-up vessels  could even reach the spill.    Oil-coated seabirds and smothered plankton -- microscopic sea creatures being  studied in experiments to gauge how increased ultraviolet sunlight will effect  the ocean surface. Accidental pollution had finally stained the laboratory of  Antarctica. It was a ""minor"" oil spill, authorities said, but the local  consequences to the fragile ecosystem will take years, if ever, to recoup.    If an innocent ship with an innocent purpose can cause potential catastrophe,  what of mining operations? Are we naive enough to believe that miners will put  on white coats and brush their feet before they unleash their industrial  maelstrom?    Citizens of the entire world, be on the alert!

The Virginia-based oil company said it had received a licence from the Treasury Department to take part in the exploration of the Blue Dragon block, off the coast of Vietnam. However, under current US regulations Mobil would not be able to take part in any future production from the field. Mobil said it hoped US restrictions would be relaxed further in future. If not, it would have to dispose of its interest should the field prove commercially attractive. Mobil's 50 per cent interest in a consortium formed to explore the area, alongside three Japanese companies, follows the oil group's involvement in Vietnam in the early 1970s. At that time it conducted the exploratory drilling in the White Tiger field, a moderately sized off-shore development which is now the Vietnam's only oil-producing field. Vietnam's award of the exploration contract to the Mobil consortium, and the US's decision to grant a licence, comes at a time when US energy groups are investing heavily overseas in search of large-scale finds to replace their dwindling US reserves.

0,FT944-4341 ,"FT944-4341 _AN-ELHD0AG0FT 941208   FT  08 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia puts its oil industry on the back burner - The country could soon become Opec's first net importer      By ROBERT CORZINE and MANUELA SARAGOSA   Fifty years ago this week Japanese troops in the jungles of central Sumatra used abandoned American equipment to drill the only wildcat exploration oil well in Indonesia during the long Pacific war. The oil-soaked sand that the drill bit struck during the night of December 4 1944 turned out to be the Minas field, the largest oil accumulation east of Iran and east Asia's only 'super-giant' field. Its discovery came too late to change Japan's military fortunes. But in the 42 years since commercial production began Minas's low sulphur crude oil has helped to fuel Japan's economic transformation. It has also helped to pay for Indonesia's ambitious industrialisation plans. But just as south-east Asia has become the fastest growing international oil market, Indonesia is about to lose its status as a net oil exporter. Many western companies say the day could be staved off if the government eased the conditions under which they operate as contractors to Pertamina, the state oil company. But the government appears to be betting that it can be the first member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to switch its energy exports from oil to natural gas, the world's fastest growing fossil fuel market. A recent World Bank report predicted that the oil sector's share of gross domestic product would drop to about 6 per cent by the year 2010, compared with 18 per cent in 1990 and 28 per cent in 1980. Last month President Suharto told the Opec meeting in Bali that oil 'no longer plays an important role' in the Indonesian economy. But in spite of such statements there is considerable sensitivity about when the country will become a net oil importer. The government says Indonesia can maintain its current status well into the next decade. Oil industry executives say it is likely to become a net importer before 2000, in spite of some easing last year of exploration terms. 'The government is not seriously encouraging exploration,' said one US oil company executive in Jakarta. 'Even if they change their terms now they might find they have done so too late because the exploration cycle takes so long.' A British executive said: 'Pertamina understands the need to modify their exploration terms, but the government does not.' Some executives say Indonesia's success in diversifying its export base has had a big impact on the government's thinking about the importance of the oil industry. The World Bank predicts that the decline of oil export earnings means that non-oil exports will need to generate about 85 per cent of Indonesia's total export earnings in 2000. Textile and timber products, the two main non-oil exports, are not showing substantial growth. Textile exports are actually slowing down. But there are fast-growing sectors, among which the World Bank lists ceramics, non-ferrous metals and electronic goods, which are poised to take over from oil. Oil industry dissatisfaction with the government's current terms are reflected in the downturn in recent exploration activity. A report by Mackay Consultants of the UK says the number of offshore exploration and appraisal wells drilled this year has fallen to 45, compared with 48 in 1993. Other analysts, such as Mr Gavin Law of international oil consultants Wood Mackenzie, say the downward trend is likely to continue, even though Indonesia has attractive frontier acreage, especially in the eastern part of the country around Irian Jaya. He believes part of the problem is that Jakarta does not allow companies to offset high frontier exploration costs against their more mature production elsewhere in the country. A single exploration well in Irian Jaya can cost Dollars 20m or more because of the remote location and harsh conditions, compared with Dollars 2m or so in more developed areas. The lack of exploration success has caused some western companies to reduce their presence in the country, concentrating, in preference, on neighbouring Malaysia and Vietnam where they say terms are better. Other companies, however, are responding to the government's greater emphasis on gas. The signing last month of the Dollars 40bn contract with Exxon, the US energy group, to develop the giant Natuna gas field should help Indonesia to maintain its status as the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. Other gas fields are being developed for power generation within Indonesia, although questions over future government policies on electricity pricing and regulation could still hamper plans for gas to increase its share of domestic primary energy consumption to 32 per cent by 2000, from the current level of 25 per cent.

Amoco said it planned to spend Dollars 3.2bn on capital investment and exploration next year, a budget that is largely unchanged on the spending level authorised for this year. Some Dollars 1.85bn of this amount will be devoted to exploration and production, of which 70 per cent, or some Dollars 1.3bn, will be outside the US. Last year, the company spent Dollars 1.275bn on exploration and production overseas. A growing number of US oil and gas companies have decided recently to redirect exploration efforts away from the US. This trend results partly from congressional and local restrictions on drilling offshore of Florida and California and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Last July, Amoco announced cost-cutting plans to take an Dollars 800m restructuring charge in the second quarter and to reduce its workforce by 8,500 employees, or 16 per cent, by the end of next year. In the first nine months of this year, Amoco's net income was Dollars 222m, compared with Dollars 1.33bn in the same period of last year.  The Financial Times   London Page 25  "

He insisted that the likely impact of the new regime had been carefully examined before its introduction and provision made for up to Pounds 200m to be available in the current financial year for any transitional relief that was required. The government secured a majority of 36 (289-253) to defeat a Labour amendment to the Finance Bill designed to provide more wide ranging transitional relief. An amendment moved by Mr Alex Salmond for the Scottish Nationalists with a similar objective was defeated by a government majority of 37 (287-250). Mr Alistair Darling, a Labour treasury spokesman, accused Mr Dorrell of failing to take into account that at least 10,000 jobs would be lost as a result of the changes. He warned of the danger that the new regime would result in exploration work being exported from potential oil fields in the north sea to other parts of the world. Sun Oil, the UK arm of the Philadelphia-based energy company, yesterday sold a package of 10 North Sea exploration blocks to Amoco. The move effectively takes Sun out of North Sea exploration although the company retains some producing assets. Sun said the move was not connected to the government's oil tax PRT changes, but that its parent company had decided to reduce its exploration expenditure.   Companies:-  Sun Oil.     Amoco Corp.

Mr Satish Sharma, energy minister, said a sharp increase in exploration was needed to cope with India's fast-expanding energy demand, which is growing at 8-10 per cent a year. At present about Dollars 1.4bn is spent each year on exploration and development. The scale of the task is such that the government is seeking large foreign involvement in the oil industry, which until recently had been the sole preserve of India's two big state-owned oil companies. The government has opened a new licensing round, in which it hopes that medium-sized western oil companies will take part. Mr Sharma, who is on a world tour to promote the round, said he was aware of past accusations that India was withholding the best acreage for domestic companies. But he said the latest licensing round included areas in which there were confirmed oil and gas deposits. He also acknowledged that there was a perception among the big western oil companies that India was unlikely to contain the very large fields which were most highly valued. He noted, however, that half of India's 26 sedimentary basins remained unexpl-ored. The minister added that a significant number of cash-rich private Indian companies were keen to enter the oil industry with western partners.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

0,FT923-13483 ,"FT923-13483 _AN-CGMA3AEDFT 920713   FT  13 JUL 92 / Oil industry refines its operations: A look at structural change in the US energy sector      By ALAN FRIEDMAN   THE US oil and gas industry will this week begin reporting mainly lower second-quarter earnings against a backdrop of dramatic reductions in capital spending and job numbers at many companies. The cuts are more than a cyclical reaction to the weakness of US demand for petroleum products and crude oil prices that are well below levels seen just before the Gulf war in January, 1991. Instead, industry experts say the US sector has begun a structural change that could ultimately shift much exploration and production away from the United States while raising energy prices for retail and corporate consumers. The challenges facing the US energy industry are several: Congressional and local restrictions on drilling in places such as the waters off the coasts of Florida and California and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska are causing many companies to redirect their exploration efforts away from the US. The sputtering US recovery and increasing price competition are keeping marketing and distribution profit margins under pressure. The industry has also concluded that the medium-term outlook is for only slightly improved crude oil and natural gas prices. The cost of modernising refineries and developing cleaner, reformulated petrol - as dictated by environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act - will be tens of billions of dollars during the next few years. The consensus view is that the industry's operating cash flow will decline by 10 per cent this year, to about Dollars 44bn (Pounds 23bn). Net profits of the energy sector, which fell by an aggregate of more than 50 per cent in the first three months of 1992, are expected to drop by at least 10 per cent in the second quarter and by almost as much for the whole of 1992. The result is that many companies are slashing operating costs. That means sharp reductions in capital spending budgets, selling non-strategic assets and saving money by redundancies that on average will eliminate up to 15 per cent of the workforces of several big US companies. Although the restructuring process has been underway for more than a year, last week saw several announcements that are typical of the trend. Last Monday, after a survey of 247 companies, Salomon Brothers forecast a drop of nearly 20 per cent in 1992 spending on North American exploration and production. Spending by these same companies outside the US was projected to rise by 9.5 per cent. On Tuesday, Mobil, the second biggest US energy group, said its 1992 capital appropriations budget would be Dollars 1bn less than previously predicted. The company's payroll was forecast to decline by 10 per cent by year-end and the disposal of more than Dollars 600m of assets was forecast. Wednesday saw Amoco, the fifth biggest US energy company, unveil plans to take an Dollars 800m restructuring charge in the second quarter and to reduce its workforce by 8,500 employees, or nearly 16 per cent, by the end of next year. On Friday, Mr Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute (API), complained that lower crude prices, the sluggish economy and drilling restrictions had caused the loss of 63,000 US energy jobs over the past year and could lead to another 50,000 redundancies over the next 12 months. In New York, Mr Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, reckoned the US sector was facing 'major structural changes,' including a dramatic shift in exploration budgets from the US to places such as republics of the former Soviet Union, Colombia, Yemen, Algeria, Venezuela and Indonesia. Mr Goldstein said spending cuts had 'decimated' the US exploration and production infrastructure of so many companies that the ability of the industry to respond in a timely manner when the economic recovery eventually strengthened was now in question. In Houston, Mr Roger Frey, an energy sector loan specialist at Chase Manhattan, attributed the structural changes to both mounting environmental costs and the fact that 'the industry can no longer bank on steady price increases'. He said there was a realisation by the industry of the need 'to adjust to only moderate oil and natural gas prices in the foreseeable future'. Mr DiBona of the API argued that while the US energy sector would eventually be leaner and more competitive, the shift away from exploration and production in the US could be permanent and could affect the US balance of payments in the 1990s. Compounding the outlook is the fact that US refinery capacity is forecast by analysts to drop by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent during the next three years, while the nation's proven reserves continue to decline over time. The implications of the US energy sector's restructuring were summed up two weeks ago by Mr Victor Burk, managing director of the oil and gas industry services division of Arthur Andersen, the consultancy. Although Mr Burk said the shift away from US exploration would continue, he noted this did not mean the US would be abandoned. Rather, the industry would enter a new era when exploration would be pursued on the basis of geographical, operational and technological niche opportunities. Mr Paul Ting, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, concluded that while 1991 was a bad year, with net income down by 21 per cent for the top 10 US energy groups, profits in the current year would also decline, although less sharply. With refining and marketing margins under pressure, much of the earnings sweepstakes in the latter half of 1992 will depend upon the price of crude, which is not expected to rise in a significant way. Earnings could improve again next year, thanks partly to the lower operating costs being wrought by restructuring. But neither US job levels nor exploration activities are expected to return to past levels for quite some time.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          CAPITAL SPENDING  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              On oil and gas exploration and production                   by top five US groups (dollarsm)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            In the US          Outside North America                           -----------        -----------------------                     1991     1992      %      1991     1992      %                    actual  estimate  change  actual  estimate  change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exxon              2,095    1,850     -11.7  3,040    3,325      +9.4 Mobil                920      600     -34.8  1,361    1,500     +10.2 Texaco               905      709     -21.7  1,044    1,112      +6.5 Chevron            1,050      850     -19.1  1,100    1,250     +13.6 Amoco               965       500     -48.2  1,233    1,200      -2.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Salomon Brothers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 13  "

The exploration, jointly undertaken by China National  Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOC) and Texaco, of the United  States, started at the end of March, according to a spokesman  from CNOC.    The Sino-U.S. team completed a seismic survey 100 meters  down, despite harsh weather conditions at the sea.    The East China Sea Oil Exploration Project is a new frontier  for the China National Offshore Oil Corporation in 750,000  square km of sea. Before this, China had independently  conducted seismic surveys in 150,000 square km since 1979 and  drilled five experimental wells, four of which have shown  excellent oil prospects. About 1,000 oil-bearing structures  have also been found.    To speed up the development of oil exploration in the East  China Sea, China conducted the Fourth International Invitation  for bids for 20 locations in 72,800 square km of sea from June  1992 to June 1993. Some 73 companies from 19 countries competed  for the projects and 15 oil exploration companies from seven  countries succeeded in the bidding, with the total risk  investment of 300 million U.S. dollars.    The successful end of this phase of prospecting in the  contracted area will provide scientific basis for the upcoming  drilling of the first well this October, the spokesman said.    About 21 experimental wells are expected to be drilled by  the  end of 1996.     "

Today he will meet with the leadership of Azerbaijan.  Questions of cooperation in oil exploration, and specifically  AMOCO's participation in the oil field exploration in the  Caspian will be discussed during the sessions.    More than three years have passed since the Azeri Government  declared its in?ent to begin exploration of oil fields with  participation of foreign companies. But political instability  and the frequent change in political regimes prevented the  signing of the contracts.    A representative of one of the oil companies told TURAN that  a few weeks ago the members of the oil consortium appealed to  the Azeri Government for a final answer concerning the contract.  Also, it became known that the companies have given an  ultimatum: They will leave Azerbaijan should if they do not  have a clear answer by that spring. [sentence as received]    A few days ago, Tim Hartnet, AMOCO's representative in Baku  told TURAN that ""we are on the eve of signing a contract. We  think it will be signed in the near future.""    The so-called ""Russian factor"" prevents an earlier signing  of  the contract. Russia, which has neither technology nor capital  to offer Azerbaijan, nevertheless wants to participate in the  distribution of Azeri oil. In November 1993, after the most  recent successful offensive of t?e Armenian army, President  Geydar Aliyev invited R?ssian Secretary for Energy Yuriy  Shafranik to Baku to sign an agreement allowing Russian  participation in exploration of Azeri oil fields. Baku agreed  to give 10 percent of Azerbaijan's s?are in the exploration  project of the Azeri-Chirag oil field to the Russian LUKOIL  company.    This gave Azerbaijan a needed break at the front. But the  planned December final signing of the contract with LUKOIL did  not take place.    At this time, Aliyev visited Paris where he proposed to  President Mitterrand that France use its capital in  reinvigorating the Azerbaijani economy. At present,  representatives of the French Elf oil company is looking into  possibilities for participation in the exploration of Azeri oil.  Meanwhile, AZADLIG newspaper writes, citing the well-informed  sources, that a massive transportation of arms and ammunition  from Russia to Armenia is taking place with the intent of  further transport to Karabakh. Evidently, on the eve of the  signing the contract with the Western oil consortium, the world  will soon hear about the next large-scale offensive by the  Armenian Army into Azerbaijani territory. Practice has already  proved this more than once.     "

North Sea operators drilled only 116 exploration and appraisal wells last year, compared with more than 170 in 1991, as persistently low oil prices and an adverse exchange rate - world oil trade is priced in dollars - forced them to cut capital expenditure. The brokerage group expects low levels of exploration to continue this year and estimates that about 120 wells will be drilled. Exploration budgets are one of the first expenditures to be trimmed when companies experience hard times. Oil prices were at a 20-year low in real terms last year, with an average sterling price of Pounds 11 a barrel. At the same time, development spending on existing fields rose significantly. That should have a positive effect over the longer term because money spent on developing newly discovered fields will generate more revenue in the next five years as production rises. Producers' cashflow was low last year at Pounds 800m compared with an average of Pounds 2.5bn over the previous five years, largely as a result of the increasing development spending. Cashflow calculated by Wood Mackenzie is an estimate of companies' total revenues in the North Sea minus exploration and development costs and taxation. Oil production reached a three-year high of 1.9m barrels a day last year and Wood Mackenzie sees further growth over the next five years.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The 16-year licences cover 28 of the 128 blocks in the Slyne and Erris Troughs lying some 70km off the west and north-west Ireland, and represent the first major offshore exploration effort in the Republic since the early 1980s. The licence terms require some 5,000km of seismic and other geophysical testing to be carried out, followed by the drilling of exploration wells. Eleven of the 28 blocks have been licenced to a consortium headed by Statoil (UK), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. In announcing the licence awards this week, Mr Noel Treacy the Irish energy minister, said the response to the round had been 'very encouraging and vindicates our recent efforts to promote offshore exploration, particularly the 1992 licensing terms and taxation measures'. These measures include a concessionary corporation tax rate of 25 per cent for companies producing oil and gas under licence. The Slyne and Erris Troughs lie in water depths ranging from 200m to over 1,000m, and is a relatively unexplored area, having had only three exploratory wells drilled to date, although seismic surveys carried out in 1991 and 1992 suggested a 'significant potential' for both oil and gas. The current licensing round, covering 178 blocks in the Porcupine Basin off the west of Ireland, closes in December this year.

This is in spite of the fact that the UK continental shelf is now a mature area for oil and gas production. Between this year and 1997 annual spending on existing and new fields should fall by less than Pounds 1bn from this year's level of Pounds 8.5bn, says Scottish Enterprise, the development body, which yesterday published its biennial forecasts for UK and worldwide petroleum activity. The forecasts contrast with those Scottish Enterprise made in 1991, which suggested a rather steeper decline in spending on exploration, development and operations from an all-time peak in 1991. In that year spending in the UK continental shelf was Pounds 9.3bn. The continued high level of development spending, measured in 1993 prices, follows the record levels of exploration and appraisal reached in 1990, when 214 wells were drilled. Only 137 exploration and appraisal wells were started last year and Scottish Enterprise does not expect more than 105 to be drilled each year up to 1997. The study suggests this is partly due to the removal in the March Budget of petroleum revenue tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. About 41 new oil or gas fields are expected to come on stream in the northern North Sea and 29 in the southern sector between 1993 and 1997.

0,FT931-3057 ,"FT931-3057 _AN-DCQCCAG3FT 930317   FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Mixed blessings for oil industry - Petroleum Revenue Tax      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   THE OIL industry was caught by surprise yesterday by the extent of the chancellor's changes to the tax regime in the North Sea. He proposed a sharp reduction in the Petroleum Revenue Tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent for existing field and its elimination for new fields. But he also said tax allowances for the industry would be sharply reduced. Few in the industry had been expecting a significant overhaul of petroleum taxes and many producers were in disarray about whether they would lose or gain from the move. But the tax changes are likely to affect the way in which companies operate in the North Sea and raise the prospect of a substantial reduction in exploration in the area. In spite of the fact that some companies will see substantial gains from the changes, many North Sea operators were infuriated by the move which they believe will place an extra burden on the industry when oil prices are low and costs high. Mr Harold Hughes, who heads the industry group: the UK Offshore Operators Association, said: 'We're very concerned at the enormity of the change - it will decrease the amount of exploration in the North Sea and add to the cost burden the industry is facing.' Mr Hughes said that exploration costs for many companies could quadruple as they will be unable to write them off against Petroleum Revenue Tax. In the past, many companies have been able to fund their entire oil drilling programmes by reclaiming PRT they have previously paid on producing fields. This is why the regime cost the treasury Pounds 200m in 1991 to 1992. But some large North Sea operators such as British Petroleum which pay a lot of PRT on producing fields will benefit from the new tax regime. City analysts reckon that the reduction in the PRT rate from 75 per cent to 50 per cent along with other tax changes could add as much as Pounds 130m to Pounds 140m to BP's profits. Mr Fergus MacLeod, industry analyst at NatWest Securities in Edinburgh, estimates that BP will make a profit of Pounds 725m this year. The PRT benefit could increase its profits by 20 per cent next year. Shell is also likely to benefit by about Pounds 40m a year, he estimates. However, smaller exploration and production companies which have traditionally written off their exploration costs against PRT will be badly affected by the move. In addition, under the proposed changes, companies such as Lasmo and Enterprise Oil will not be able to transfer tax allowance benefits between fields in the North Sea so that they offset part of their development costs for new fields against tax paid on producing fields. The UKOOA challenged the chancellor's figures for revenue he expects to raise from the tax changes. Mr Lamont said the changes will raise Pounds 300m in 1994 to 1995 and Pounds 400m the year after. However, Mr Hughes believes the figues will actually be much higher. He said it could cut down the extent to which companies want to become involved in North Sea exploration. 'This will mean companies have to review their commitments to the next licensing round (for oil exploration acreage) and some partnerships could fall apart under the strain,' he said.

0,FT932-15974 ,"FT932-15974 _AN-DDHB2AB4FT 930408   FT  08 APR 93 / Flagging oil sector at odds over tax changes: Fears over the future of exploration dilute the welcome given to the regime      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   TWO projects announced separately by Shell and British Petroleum in the past week will inject close to Pounds 2bn into the North Sea over the next five years. This is a shot in the arm for the flagging oil sector, which is suffering from persistently low oil prices. They are the type of projects the chancellor intended to encourage when he announced changes to petroleum revenue tax rules in the Budget. Both projects stand to benefit from the tax changes - some analysts reckon the new rules have added Pounds 100m to the value of BP's Forth field, which it announced it would develop last Friday. In addition, the lower tax rate will give Shell an added incentive to go ahead with the extensive plans it revealed on Tuesday to extend the life of its Brent field. But both projects were planned long before the tax changes and would probably have gone ahead anyway. Because of the long lead times required for large investment decisions in the North Sea, many oil companies fear the full effects of the changes will not be evident for many years. By that time, they argue, exploration will dwindle and it will be too late to entice it back by changing the rules again. The new rules lower the rate of tax paid on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it altogether for new fields. They also remove tax relief on exploration and appraisal work in the North Sea which will hit many of the small independent companies hardest. The Treasury estimates that the rule changes will raise Pounds 700m over three years. But this forecast has been challenged by Wood MacKenzie, the Edinburgh-based industry analyst, which estimates the revenue increase to be Pounds 115m over the same period. The industry agrees that the tax changes will quadruple the cost of exploring in the North Sea and this has caused an outcry in the oil industry. But the new rules have also led to a row between companies that stand to gain from the proposals and those that will lose. British Petroleum is one of the winners. Wood MacKenzie reckons that the new rules will improve its cashflow by Pounds 412m or 14 per cent over three years. Companies such as Amerada Hess stand to lose the most  - an estimated Pounds 83m or 10 per cent knocked off its cashflow until 1996, according to Wood MacKenzie. The split between winners and losers has made it very difficult for the industry to formulate a joint response to the government's proposals and this has undoubtedly weakened its case. The Treasury sees little justification for making changes to the new rules. But there is one issue that has united the industry - the retrospective nature of the tax changes. Companies applying for acreage to drill in the North Sea must make presentations to the Department of Trade and Industry in which they sketch out their plans for exploration. As part of this they will agree to drill a certain number of wells over a specific period of time. 'We make these commitments in good faith that the rules at the time will stay in place,' said Mr David Keith, managing director of Seafield Resources, one of the smaller UK exploration companies. Companies are calling either for a transition period during which tax relief will still apply to wells they are committed to or to be released from the obligations made under previous licensing rounds. Under the present arrangements, if companies do not drill the wells to which they are committed, the government can take away their exploration licences. The DTI has yet to respond, but it has sent a letter to companies asking if they want to revise their bids made for the 14th licensing round, the results of which are due to be announced in a couple of months. It is the independent oil sector that will be most severely affected by the new rules and many say they are looking to move much of their exploration effort overseas. Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director of British Borneo, one of the small UK exploration companies, sums it up: 'This will greatly curtail future exploration activity which is needed to find the next generation of new fields. It will decimate the drilling contractors and in the long run, will shut down much of the North Sea much sooner than we would have expected.'   Companies:-  Shell Transport and Trading.

0,FT931-697 ,"FT931-697 _AN-DC2BZABWFT 930329   FT  29 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Spoils of the North Sea   ANY TAX reform as sweeping as the chancellor's new fiscal regime for North Sea oil inevitably creates winners and losers. The more important question is whether it creates the right incentives to ensure that maximum economic benefit is extracted from the dwindling energy resources that remain. Since the present arrangements are excessively complex, incorporate inadequate incentives for companies to control costs, and are ill-designed for a period in which many North Sea oil fields are reaching maturity, the reforms probably have more to commend them than the complaints of the smaller oil producers might suggest. But if form is any guide, they will not produce quite as stable a long-term regime as the chancellor predicts. Under the old regime, only a small number of fields paid PRT at all and most of these were older fields. This was because exploration and appraisal costs could be off-set against the income from existing fields, thereby reducing or eliminating the charge to petroleum revenue tax (PRT) and corporation tax. The effect was to cut the cost of exploration and appraisal to less than 17p in the pound, which provided a powerful incentive for drilling activity. But the tax take from existing fields, which suffered from a combined rate of royalty and tax charges of just over 85 per cent, provided a countervailing disincentive to further development. As a result there was a risk that substantial energy resources would be left untapped. This has led to suggestions from some larger companies, which are responsible for about 80 per cent of the development of existing fields, that the exploration tail has been allowed to wag the development dog. It has also led to a great deal of lobbying. Underlying logic In his budget package, the chancellor appears to have bought the big companies' argument. A reduction in the rate of PRT from 75 per cent to 50 per cent means that the combined tax rate for those existing fields that pay royalty and corporation tax as well as PRT will fall from 85 per cent to nearer 70 per cent. And it is hard to quarrel with the underlying logic, given that the current rate of PRT was set when the oil price was three times higher in real terms and costs were significantly lower. The more difficult question is whether the accompanying abolition of PRT relief on exploration and appraisal costs, together with the switch to corporation tax on new fields, will lead to an undesirable reduction in the amount of exploration activity. Unhappy timing North Sea exploration has already been falling for predictable reasons: the odds on drilling successfully, according to British Petroleum, have gone from one in four to one in seven over the past five years. Exploration is understandably gravitating to more attractive prospects elsewhere. Judging by the initial reaction of many independent oil companies, this trend will accelerate. But the fact that the PRT regime has actually been costing the exchequer money poses a question about whether the government may now be subsidising sub-optimal investment in the North Sea. Certainly the reforms mean that future exploration will be more cost conscious; but because the prize to be had from developing new fields will be greater under corporation tax rules than before, the Treasury's calculation must be that drilling will continue where the prospects of significant finds are best. From negative PRT revenues of Pounds 200m in 1991-92, the Treasury expects an inflow of Pounds 300m in 1994-5 and Pounds 400m thereafter. It is nonetheless worrying that the hard-pressed independent sector, which has performed a useful role in the North Sea, is being so obviously disadvantaged relative to the giants of the industry - and hardly surprising that independent companies are distrustful of the Treasury's motives. The timing of the chancellor's move also looks unhappy, given the adverse job consequences at a time of rising unemployment. That said, the broad thrust of the tax reforms is right for a North Sea that is reaching maturity. But if the suspicion that the Treasury's revenue calculations are based on over-optimistic assumptions about the future level of exploration proves right, the new corporation tax regime will no doubt grow complications just as readily the old PRT did.

Santos said its pre-tax operating profit of ADollars 223m was a record, with the exception of 1985 and 1990, when oil prices exceeded ADollars 40 a barrel for part of the year. Oil prices averaged ADollars 28 in the year to December. The group said net profit before abnormal items was ADollars 114m, compared with ADollars 137m in the previous year. However, the result was struck after foreign exchange losses of ADollars 11m, compared with ADollars 1m in the previous year. The 1990 result also included a profit of ADollars 12m from the sale of UK operations. The write-downs, which were foreshadowed in the 1990 annual report, follow a disappointing exploration programme in the Timor Sea. Of 12 wells scheduled to be drilled during the year, eight were dry and the remainder were postponed or abandoned. The biggest write-down was ADollars 154m against unsuccessful exploration expenditure in a number of permit areas which will be relinquished this year or next. A further ADollars 80m related to producing licences acquired with Peko Oil. The group said it would maintain an active exploration programme in the Timor Sea. However, it plans to drill only five exploration wells and carry out 15,000 kilometres of seismic testing this year. Santos said it would begin exploration efforts this year in the North Sea, Cambodia and Colombia, where interests had been acquired since June 1991. Exploration would continue in the US and Malaysia, but would be reduced in the Timor Sea and the Cooper Basin in South Australia. The US write-down of ADollars 40m reflects a lower valuation for the group's gas assets. The board said the group's US assets were now centred on Weeks Exploration, a growing exploration company with good growth potential. Sales revenue fell 7.6 per cent ADollars 656m from the 1990 record of ADollars 709m. The fall was caused by lower crude oil prices compared to 1990, when the Gulf war inflated prices, and lower volumes for all products except naphtha. The directors declared an unchanged final dividend of 10 cents per share, fully franked.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

'Just our developments in the North Sea alone will propel us to that target,' said Mr Robert Evans, chairman. 'We are now producing oil and gas in eight countries overseas and could see more than 40 per cent of our profits coming from international exploration and production by 2000.' Mr Howard Dalton, managing director of the exploration division, said he would have a 29 per cent share of the capital expenditure budget this year amounting to Pounds 754m. British Gas would spend this on its exploration efforts in Tunisia, Russia and Argentina, among other countries. In 1991, exploration and production contributed Pounds 221m to British Gas' overall after-tax profit of Pounds 1.16bn. Mr Evans said that the group was ready to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in the oil and gas sector where share prices were severely depressed by low oil prices. COMMENT The City showed little reaction to British Gas's profits for last year and the shares slipped 1p to 258p. That could be due to the difficulty of making comparisons between last year and the previous one since the group has changed its financial accounting year. But the shares are currently more vulnerable to political or regulatory announcements about the future of competition in the UK gas business than to small changes in British Gas's profit levels. The company raised its dividend by 7 per cent to 10.25p for the nine months from April - giving a notional level of 13.4p for the year as a whole. British Gas is committed to raising its dividend and, for the past few years, has increased the pay-out at a rate of 8 to 10 per cent a year - well above the rate of inflation and the rest of the market. While there is a great deal of regulatory risk to be taken on when investing in the shares, the company is set for substantial growth in its international exploration and production business which is outside the jurisdiction of UK regulators. It is expected to triple its oil and gas production by 1995 compared with slight increases of about 1 per cent for the leading oil companies. In addition, although the new domestic pricing formula will bite into UK profits, Mr Evans is commited to a programme of cost reduction that aims at minimising its effect. If the government and regulators go ahead with an oft-threatened break-up of the company, that could also release significant value for shareholders.

Gloosy coffee-table books featuring the Caribbean island lie in the reception area. Geological maps of Cuba dot the walls, and pictures of Cuban government officials line the chairman's bookshelf. The company last summer became the first western mining company to sign an exploration agreement with Geominera, the Cuban mining agency. Its exploration manager and another geologist will move there soon in the hope of striking rich on the three properites, totalling 1.2m acres, to which Joutel now has exploration rights. Joutel is by no means alone. BHP of Australia, the UK's RTZ, and Inco, the Toronto-based nickel producer, are among others rumoured to be seeking a foothold in Cuba. US companies are barred from direct involvement by Washington's long-standing economic embargo. Metall Mining, a subsidiary of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has already agreed to spend CDollars 1m (USDollars 756,000) over four years to acquire a 25 per cent interest in one of Joutel's properties. Another junior Canadian company, Caribgold Resources, also recently signed a joint venture with Geominera. As in the Joutel deal, costs will be equally shared by the Canadian and Cuban partners. Summing up both the risks and rewards, Mr Barry Allan, mining analyst at Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Toronto, describes Cuba as 'a promoter's dream'. It is 'genuinely an under-explored area', he says, while cautioning that 'you're talking about very early grassroots exploration and that's a high-risk activity'. Mr Hugh Harbinson, Joutel's chairman, says that 'our ambition is to find three deposits in three years.' Joutel will be looking primarily for gold, but also for a variety of base metals. Under the agreement with the Cubans, the company has up to eight years to prepare a mine feasibility study. It plans to start an airborne geophysical survey in January. Pointing to the geological map on his wall and to some colourful rocks on his desk, Mr Harbinson notes that Russian geologists have already done a good deal of preliminary exploration work in Cuba. Joutel and Caribgold each claim that several hundred mineral occurrences have been catalogued on their properties. As further evidence of Cuba's mineral wealth, the Canadians point to three nickel mines in Oriente province, on the south-east tip of the island, which have been sizeable suppliers to the former Soviet Union. The Canadian companies are being backed by a group of securities firms, including Gordon Capital and Thomson Kernaghan of Toronto and Yorkton Securities of Vancouver. They are in the process of raising CDollars 4m, mostly from Europe, to finance Joutel's share of exploration costs. Caribgold recently raised CDollars 8m. Thomson Kernaghan described Cuba in a recent research report as potentially 'one of the best new places to invest in Latin America'. It cited the island's volcanic origin, educated population and the willingness of the Castro government to allow foreign investors to repatriate profits and dividends. Mr Harbinson is unconcerned by the threat of political instability. He says that no other claims have been registered against Joutel's properties and 'we're going on the assumption that any new government will honour our contracts'.

Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said the award of the licences to Eukan Energy Limited and Altwood Petroleum was made outside the formal licensing rounds for exploration acreage. It was the first use of the 'out-of-round procedure', under which companies can apply to the government for acreage in areas where they believe early exploration for oil and gas is merited. 'The use of the out-of-round procedure in this case is another example of the flexibility of our licensing system,' Mr Eggar said. The five licences are in the following areas: Yorkshire, north-east of Sheffield. the Staffordshire/Cheshire border north-east of Stoke-on-Trent. the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border north-west of Nottingham. Surrey and Sussex between the North and South Downs. All of the licences are on private land. The companies will need planning permission and the owners' consent before they can begin seismic testing and exploratory drilling. A separate government appraisal licence would be required if any oil or gas is discovered. In another move intended to demonstrate flexibility in on-shore oil and gas exploration, the government allowed Tullow Exploration temporarily to extend its seismic work 1km beyond the boundaries of two licences it holds in Lincolnshire. Mr Eggar said the award of the new type of seismic survey licence was 'a clear demonstration of our commitment to support oil and gas companies through a flexible licensing system'. The licence awarded yesterday does not allow any drilling and only covers areas adjacent to a principal licence. It will last for one year.   Companies:-  Eukan Energy.     Altwood Petroleum.

He stressed that the supply sector of the oil exploration industry needed time to adjust to the new tax regime through the provision of a 'meaningful transitional arrangement'. Mr Knapman, speaking during the resumed committee stage of the Finance Bill, suggested that it should be possible to devise a 'fiscally neutral' scheme. Earlier Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, defended the decision of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, not to consult the industry in advance about the changes. Mr Alistair Darling, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, said the disruption caused to the industry by the chancellor's sudden announcement could result in the loss of between 10,000 and 30,000 jobs. He accepted that there was scope for adjusting petroleum revenue tax, and possibly for limiting the allowances that could be claimed in connection with exploration, providing the changes were phased in and permitted transitional relief. Mr Malcolm Bruce, for the Liberal Democrats, said his party would support a Labour amendment to provide transitional relief. Sun Oil, the UK arm of the Philadelphia-based energy company, yesterday sold a package of 10 North Sea exploration blocks to Amoco. The move effectively takes Sun out of North Sea exploration although the company retains some producing assets. Sun said the move was not connected to the government's oil tax changes, but that its parent company had decided last September to reduce its exploration expenditure.

However, it has caught world  attention with the discovery of China's largest shallow sea oil  field--the Chengdao oil field, which has recently been put into  development. The development of this oil field not only presents  a bright future for China's eastern oil industry, it also opens  a new era in the development of China's shallow sea oil fields.    About 100 kilometers north of the famous oil city of  Dongying  in eastern China and out into the sea where the Huang He enters  the sea, one sees four offshore oil rigs. According to the  Shengli Shallow Sea Company, this oil field has a daily output  of 1,500 tons. It has produced, up until late August this year,  42,000 tons of crude oil. This is very encouraging news as the  oil field has just been put into production.    The change from long-term exploration alone to exploration  and development at the same time in the Chengdao oil field was  necessitated by the development of the Shengli oil field and  also the development of Eastern China's oil industry. The  Shengli oil field is China's second largest oil field, with an  output last year of 33.50 million tons, about one-fourth of the  nation's total oil output. The Chinese government, in its Eighth  Five-Year Plan, states the strategy of ""stabilizing the east and  developing the west"" in oil development. However, it is no easy  task to stabilize and maintain the current level of output in  the east. The development of the Chengdao oil field has  significance as a backup oil field to Shengli and also as a  reserve area. This is an integral part of China's oil industry  development strategy.    The Tarim Basin and Bo Hai Wan are China's two brightest  stars in the oil industry. Bo Hai Wan, adjacent to Shengli, is a  shallow sea area with an average depth of less than 20 meters.  The layer of sedimentary rocks lies flat on top of each other on  the sea bed. Bo Hai Wan has rich oil reserves. It is also a  strategically important area in China's oceanic development.  China views the continental shelf oil development and Tarim  Basin oil development in the west as the keystone in its oil  industry.    Bo Hai Wan is about 80,000 square kilometers in area and it  is an integral part of the North China oil and gas area. The  Chinese government started specific gravity measurement and  exploration in Bo Hai Wan as early as 1965 and this work has  never stopped. For the Shengli oil field, ever since the latter  half of the 1980's, exploration has focused on the Bin Hai area,  with the discovery of Gudong and other oil fields. In 1988, in  the Bo Hai Wan area where the Huang He enters the sea, the  Chengdao oil field was discovered. This field controls an  oil-bearing area of 36 square kilometers. It was discovered and  verified that the oil field has oil and gas reserves exceeding  100 million tons, and by the year 1995 its capacity could be  developed to an annual total of 1 million tons of oil. The  annual increase of oil geological reserve is about 30 percent of  Shengli's annual increase of reserve. Its long-term reserve is  expected to reach several hundreds of million tons. The  discovery was ranked as one of China's top 10 technological  achievements in 1988 and is highly regarded by China's oil and  technological circles. Shouldering the task of exploring and  developing China's largest shallow sea oil field at present is  the Shengli Oil Field Shallow Sea Exploration and Development  Company. This is the only company in China capable of shallow  sea and ultra-shallow sea oil exploration and development. The  company not only undertakes the exploration and development of  Chengdao oil field, it also dispatches oil rigs and ships to  Liaodong Wan and North Bay to work in the shallow waters there.  The company is a significant force in the exploration and  development of continental shelf and shallow sea oil development  in the eastern part of China.    The company has about 2,600 employees, three docks, five  offshore oil rigs, a floating platform and 34 auxiliary vessels  including two triple-purpose vessels equipped with  satellite-guided navigational aids. The special-purpose wharf  was completed and put into operation at the end of July. The  dock can accommodate all ship and platforms.    With the decision in 1984 by the Chinese government to set  up  the Shengli Oil field Shallow Sea Oil Drilling Company, Shengli  Oil Field Shallow Sea Development Company also underwent  corresponding changes to keep up with the development. Its scale  of operation expanded continuously. The technology of oceanic  oil development went to new highs. This is particularly so since  last year when good news came in oil drilling. Eight oil wells  each with a daily output of 100 tons were drilled one after the  other, greatly increasing the oil-bearing area of Chengdao oil  field and also the geological reserves of the oil field.    Wei Xueyi, deputy general manager of Shengli oil field, is  also general manager of the Shallow Sea Company and the person  responsible for the development of the Chengdao oil field. He  remarked that the change from exploration alone to exploration  and development together is an historical change. Chengdao will  be responsible for 30 percent of the increase in production in  the Shengli oil field and this is very significant in the  nation's oil development strategy of stabilizing and maintaining  the east. However, he said, because of various limitations such  as capital, the pace of development cannot be pushed too fast.  The task this year for Chengdao oil field is to have eight  exploration wells and three production wells and to have an  additional geological reserve of 20-30 million tons. The company  takes ""the easy one first, the high output ones first, early  development and early harvest"" approach. The company is taking a  pragmatic approach of building smaller and easier drilling  platforms and trying to put into production as soon as possible  the wells that have been drilled.    In order to expedite the development of shallow sea oil,  Shengli Shallow Sea Oil Exploration and Development Company  relentlessly explored new technology and has successfully raised  the technological level of oceanic oil exploration. Over 100  technological achievements were made. One of the technological  achievements is the self-designed and built ""Shengli No. 2""  shallow sea ""Walking"" oil rig, which can walk in ultra-shallow  waters at a speed of 60 meters per hour--the world's first  ultra-shallow sea walking oil rig--and is ranked as one of the  top 10 technological achievements for 1992.    In order to develop the rich reserves of this shallow water  oil field, Wei Xueyi and his management team are traveling  throughout the nation and also overseas for the purchase of  offshore oil drilling platforms, oil rigs and various transport  vessels and equipment so as to expedite the development of this  oil field. This is also the golden opportunity for foreign  companies to sell equipment and technology to China.    Obviously, the development of Chengdao oil field opens up a  new road for the development of Bo Hai Wan and China's Shallow  Sea oil development. A new horizon and new hopes are now  visible. A lot of human resources and material and capital will  be put into the Bo Hai Wan and the continental shelf development  between now and the advent of the next century.     "

The meeting's purpose was to reach  an agreement on measures and draft a plan to combat sea  pollution, especially that caused by oil slicks.    Representatives from Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru,  Brazil,  Poland, the PRC, the ROK, Russia, and Ecuador who attended the  meeting committed themselves to asking their respective  governments to buy the standard antipollution material suggested  by the Chilean Navy. They decided to draft a concerted action  program at their next meeting.    Commodore Urdangarin stated: ""All the participants  acknowledged that Chile is the only country that has the ways  and means to combat pollution in the Antarctica in a systematic  way. We have both the qualified people and the infrastructure  in the vessels of the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol and the  Prat Base and Fildes Port Garrison.""    He underscored that this initiative was materialized by  Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, the Navy commander in chief, who  had the foresight to plan for possible problems arising from the  increase in sea traffic.    On that occasion, the commanders of the bases and stations  in  the South Shetland Islands located in Antarctica, agreed to  appoint the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol as the operations  coordinator in case of a possible environmental disaster in the  area.    At present, only the Chilean Navy has the necessary vessels,  equipment, and staff to face an emergency such as this, as well  as to undertake rescue operations with the Antarctic Patrol.     "

It also breaks the monopoly of state-owned Petroecuador in some sectors. Oil companies will receive a percentage of their crude production to sell in the domestic or international market. Industry analysts say cutting bureaucratic ties between the oil companies and the government will allow Ecuador to compete with oil-producing neighbours for scarce investment capital. The country has not secured an exploration contract in five years. Contracts for the exploration and production of natural gas in the Gulf of Guayaquil in the south-west will be auctioned. Winning bidders will have up to five years to develop the field and find a market. The law also permits the private sector to increase capacity of the Trans-Ecuadorean pipeline from the Amazon region across the Andes to the Pacific.   Companies:-  Petroecuador.

General Program Requirements_Connecting Activities               Comment:     One commenter believed that the description of information collection and analysis in the connecting activities component of the ``General Program Requirements'' of the priority is too general to provide useful information. The commenter believed that the information should include annual participation and post-program outcomes, and that the data should be ``disaggregated'' by gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic background, limited-English proficiency, and disability, so that any lack of participation or achievement by one group would not be masked by the success of the program for the general population.           Discussion:     The Secretaries agree with the commenters that disaggregated data is likely to be important for determinations of the success of the program for all groups.

This may include information on gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic background, limited-English proficiency, and disability.           Changes:     A change has been made to the ``General Program Requirements Connecting Activities'' section of notice so that it is specified that among the information that may be collected is information on gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic background, limited-English proficiency, and disability.           Comment:     One commenter requested that the Secretaries add the following additional requirement to the list of connecting activities in the priority: ``Providing job coaching services to youth with disabilities within a supported employment model.'' The commenter believed that job coaches could help students acquire job skills and could help employers achieve the workplace accommodations that may be necessary to job success.           Discussion:     As is provided for in the school-based and work-based learning components respectively, career exploration and counseling, as well as workplace mentoring, must be provided to all students. In addition, the notice requires States to describe in their applications how they will ensure opportunities for all students, including students with disabilities, to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs. While the Secretaries believe that funds awarded under this competition may be expended to cover the costs of what the commenter has referred to as job coaching for disabled students within a supported employment model, States may also seek to utilize funds available from other sources to meet what may be the special needs of disabled students participating in their School-to-Work Opportunities programs. Indeed, under paragraph (b)(4) of the priority, States are specifically required to describe how their School-to-Work Opportunities systems will coordinate the use of education and training funds from State and private sources with related Federal program funds.

0,FT931-900 ,"FT931-900 _AN-DC1AGABUFT 930327   FT  27 MAR 93 / Tory MPs urge help for tax-hit oil companies      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   THERE IS growing political pressure on the government to provide transitional relief for oil companies affected by changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax announced in last week's Budget. Some Conservative politicians are calling for help for smaller oil exploration companies, which stand to lose most from the tax changes. The government plans to reduce the rate of the tax on existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it on new fields. It has also removed the tax allowances for exploration and appraisal, which will hit the small independent companies hardest. The industry is split on the issue and some oil exploration companies such as Amerada Hess have mounted intense lobbying campaigns against the tax changes. Others, such as British Petroleum, have stressed the benefits of the new regime. In a written reply to a parliamentary question, the Treasury said yesterday that: 'offshore activities deemed to be commercially viable prior to the tax changes should be unaffected by the changes'. But Mr George Kynoch, MP for Kincardine and Deeside, told Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that some of the smaller companies would need transitional relief in the move to the new regime. 'I'm making sure I convey the difficulties some companies are incurring in the transitional period so that the chancellor can make some fine-tuning at the committee stage,' Mr Kynoch said yesterday. He is gathering evidence from a range of companies to present to the Treasury after the Easter recess. Present arrangements for the move to the new tax regime state that any companies with outstanding contracts for drilling work will still be able to claim exploration and appraisal relief. Many independent companies want those arrangements not only to include firm contracts, but also obligations for drilling programmes made to the government.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

From Associated Press      PARIS      Six weary but jubilant adventurers from six nations completed a seven-month,  3,800-mile trek across Antarctica on skis and dog sleds Saturday, in the  longest unmechanized crossing of the continent.    ""It's a dangerous land, without mercy,"" co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne of France  said moments after the team arrived at a Soviet base on the Indian Ocean coast.    The men were given a huge loaf of fresh bread and chugged champagne as the  flags of their homelands flapped above them in a strong wind.    Besides Etienne, the team included American co-leader Will Steger of Ely,  Minn.; Victor Boyarsky of the Soviet Union; Geoff Somers of Britain; Quin Dahe  of China, and Keizo Funatsu of Japan.    Interviewed on ABC-TV's ""Wide World of Sports,"" Steger was asked what he  intends to do now that the journey has ended. He laughed and said: ""Take a  sauna.""    ""We can relax and join the human race again,"" he said.    The Minnesota-based expedition almost ended in tragedy in its final hours. As  the team struggled through a storm toward the Soviet research base of Mirnyy,  Funatsu disappeared in a blizzard for 11 hours before he was found Friday.    Steger said it was ""very close. We were lucky we found him.""    The crossing was by far the longest of its type across Antarctica, but  apparently not the first without motor power.    On Feb. 12, Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner and West German adventurer  Arved Fuchs completed what they said was a 1,700-mile crossing on foot, without  the use of sled dogs. They are expected to arrive in Frankfurt later this month  to provide details of their journey.    Etienne's team is scheduled to return to France for welcoming celebrations  March 21. They then head to the United States for ceremonies in Minneapolis --  which along with Paris served as expedition headquarters -- and in Washington,  where President Bush is expected to meet them at the White House.    Bush, in a congratulatory message, said: ""Your spirit of international  friendship and cooperation not only helped make this fantastic journey possible  but also set a wonderful example for the world community of nations.""    The expedition, undertaken at a cost of about $11 million after three years of  planning, was intended to build support for Antarctica's preservation and  demonstrate the power of international cooperation. The members had their  expenses paid, but they received no salaries.    ""Antarctica isn't threatened by pollution, it's still virgin and white,""  Etienne said in a hookup with reporters in Paris. ""All countries should forget  their partisan interests and offer it to the world. . . . This continent  belongs to everyone.""    He described Antarctica as ""huge and sometimes monstrous."" In seven months, he  said, the only other living things seen by the team were their sled dogs and  three birds.    Experts at expedition headquarters in Paris praised the performance of the sled  dogs, which were trained by Steger. All but one of the 36 dogs used on the  expedition survived, and a special high-nutrition diet appeared to have kept  them in excellent health.    The journey began July 28 near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, which  reaches out toward South America. On Dec. 11, the team reached its halfway  point, becoming the first to reach the South Pole by dog sled since Roald  Amundsen in 1911.    ""The first two months were very, very hard,"" Etienne said. ""We started to doubt  after a month whether we would make it.""    It had been feared bad weather might strand the adventurers on the continent  for as long as a month and jeopardize an elaborate international tour to tout  the expedition.    But high winds pushed apart ice that had blocked the Mirnyy harbor, leaving a  path for a ship that will take them to New Zealand. Soviet Antarctic officials  in Leningrad told Cathy DeMoll, the expedition's manager in Paris, that unless  conditions change, loading of the ship will begin Monday.    The wind was howling at 70 m.p.h. and the temperature was 20 degrees below zero  when Funatsu went outside his tent, a spokeswoman in Minnesota said.    When Funatsu did not arrive back in his tent for dinner, team members tied  themselves together and searched the area for several hours before giving up  because of darkness. The search resumed early Friday, and Funatsu was found  about two hours later, expedition staff reported.    Etienne said that when expedition members passed Funatsu calling ""Keizo! Keizo!  Keizo!"" he ""jumped out like a mushroom from the snow. He was in very good  shape.""    ""He had survived by digging a hole in the snow and crawling inside, just as the  dogs do each night to stay warm,"" the spokeswoman said.

It had been feared bad weather might strand the adventurers on the continent  for as long as a month and jeopardize an elaborate international tour to tout  the expedition.    But high winds pushed apart ice that had blocked the Mirnyy harbor, leaving a  path for a ship that will take them to New Zealand. Soviet Antarctic officials  in Leningrad told Cathy DeMoll, the expedition's manager in Paris, that unless  conditions change, loading of the ship will begin Monday.    The wind was howling at 70 m.p.h. and the temperature was 20 degrees below zero  when Funatsu went outside his tent, a spokeswoman in Minnesota said.    When Funatsu did not arrive back in his tent for dinner, team members tied  themselves together and searched the area for several hours before giving up  because of darkness. The search resumed early Friday, and Funatsu was found  about two hours later, expedition staff reported.    Etienne said that when expedition members passed Funatsu calling ""Keizo! Keizo!  Keizo!"" he ""jumped out like a mushroom from the snow. He was in very good  shape.""    ""He had survived by digging a hole in the snow and crawling inside, just as the  dogs do each night to stay warm,"" the spokeswoman said.

However, the negative impact of recent UK tax changes resulted in after-tax profits sinking by 17 per cent to Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 4.63m). The company yesterday confirmed that the government's removal of tax concessions for exploration activities in last March's Budget was affecting short-term cash flow and earnings. Its Petroleum Revenue Tax credit in the period was Pounds 1.69m, against Pounds 4.1m. Mr Douglas Baker, chairman, said the change had 'adversely affected the risk/reward ratio of exploration in the United Kingdom continental shelf'. He added that Hardy would continue to explore in UK waters, but 'opportunities there will have to be more rigorously justified'. The effect of the UK tax changes were partially offset by Hardy's strong position in the US, which accounted for half of group operating profits, which almost doubled to Pounds 6m (Pounds 3.2m). The US contribution was Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 984,000), the result of higher volumes, stronger US gas prices and positive foreign exchange movements. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.14m (Pounds 527,000). Earnings per share were 3.8p (5p). Mr Baker noted that Hardy's high levels of gas production, accounting for two thirds of current output, had reduced its vulnerability to low oil prices. He predicted that Hardy would continue to benefit from rising gas production in the US, where prices remained buoyant because of seasonal high demand. 'The group's operating cash flow, even at current levels, should substantially exceed that for last year,' he added. The company also pointed to exploration successes in Canada and Pakistan as positive factors for future growth.   Companies:-  Hardy Oil and Gas.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The emphasis is on finding more natural gas. PanCanadian holds the biggest land base for exploration in western Canada. Mr O'Brien said although the company's debt level was low, PanCanadian preferred to grow internally because of the high cost of acquisitions. PanCanadian is reducing its investment in a joint venture oil project in Russia because production was not profitable. The blended price available for Russian crude was about USDollars 13 a barrel, well below the current world price for conventional oil, said Mr O'Brien.

But Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the withdrawals had not significantly affected the success of the latest offshore licensing round, which was the largest for 20 years. The government yesterday awarded 110 blocks for offshore oil exploration out of the 484 put on offer as part of the largest range of offerings since 1972. Oil companies showed much interest in important new areas for exploration such as the area west of the Shetland Isles, and Cardigan Bay off the Welsh coast. Mr Eggar said he had particularly strong hopes for the area west of Shetland. 'I think we are on the verge of proving up a major new province which will be very significant for the future of the industry and UK oil production,' he said. But oil companies have been protesting about the government's proposed changes to North Sea taxes. Mr Eggar said that, with the seven withdrawals, some companies had altered their original work programmes in response to the tax change. The PRT reforms would reduce the rate of tax paid on existing fields but abolish tax relief for exploration work. Companies had committed themselves to drill 93 wells, but this was lower than had been expected before the tax changes, Mr Eggar said. The Department of Trade and Industry has imposed stringent new environmental requirements on many companies which have been awarded blocks close to the coast. This affected 35 blocks and Mr Eggar announced measures to monitor closely companies' adherence to their environmental plans. Greenpeace, the environmental group, said it was alarmed by Mr Eggar's announcements yesterday. It said the UK was in the process of implementing a directive from the EC to protect natural habitats which could ban industrial activity in some coastal waters.

Zeng Xingqiu, vice-president of China National Oil and Gas  Exploration and Development Corp. (CNODC), said exploration work  was carried out in the first, second and fourth blocks, with  AGIP, Esso and BP being the respective operators.    The three blocks, situated in the south-east of the  Taklimakan Desert, totalled 38,765 square kilometers, Zeng said.  The operators will work out exploration details and implement  them in the light of the contracts, he added.    CNODC concluded two oil contracts and one agreement on a  geo-physical survey with the three operating groups formed by 14  foreign companies after they won the bidding.    A total of 68 companies from 17 countries had expressed  interest in the five blocks China offered, although fewer tabled  tenders afterwards.    Zeng said he was satisfied with the result of the bidding,  China's first for onshore oil and gas exploration. He said the  harsh natural conditions in the desert pose severe challenges to  exploratory operations there.    The Tarim Basin, with an area of 560,000 square kilometers,  is one of the few ""virgin areas"" in the world for oil and gas  exploration. However, most of it is covered with dunes or even  sand hills, and often referred to as a ""sea of death.""    ""At a time when oil prices are stagnant, so many companies'  participation in the bidding indicates their deep interest in  China's oil and gas prospects,"" he added.    Zeng said China's second round of onshore international  bidding has fared well. This time China exposed 26 blocks for  risk exploration and 11 projects for enhancing oil recovery.    So far 76 companies from 17 countries in the world have  registered and are studying data packages. Some of them have  even made field tours, he said.    The deadline for lodging tenders is September 28 this year,  he added.     "

So for the first time Latin America is emerging as the most favoured area for mining exploration, jumping from third place in 1993 to top this year. At the same time spending in the US is falling, according to the latest annual survey of mining exploration expenditure by Metals Economics Group, the Canadian consultancy. Total expenditure budgeted for this year by the 151 companies surveyed by MEG is up by a net USDollars 206.4m from the 1993 level to Dollars 9.13bn - the second successive annual increase and conclusively reversing the trend for budget cuts seen at the end of the 1980s and in the early 1990s. MEG says its survey covers about 80 per cent of world-wide expenditures. The consultants attempt to exclude from the totals any portion of diversified company budgets devoted to energy minerals, iron ore or aluminium-related exploration. Companies with budgets totalling Dollars 2.05bn give a geographic split of their spending. MEG says this shows 26.5 per cent (Dollars 543.7m against Dollars 331m in 1993) will be spent in Latin America, with Chile the most-favoured country followed by Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Peru. Meanwhile, spending in the US, which has ranged between Dollars 340m and Dollars 350m, is dropping below Dollars 325m this year, marking 'the first time that the perceived constriction caused by the more stringent US regulatory environment has actually manifested in company budget allocations'. Of the Dollars 9.13bn of total spending covered by the survey, 56.4 per cent (Dollars 1.2bn) is going towards gold exploration, up from 49 per cent (Dollars 925m) in 1993. Base metals exploration is down to 31 per cent (Dollars 660.3m), from 35 per cent (Dollars 669m). Some 57 per cent of base metals expenditure is being directed this year at copper. Grassroots spending - as distinct from exploration at or near existing mine sites - is accounting for 53.5 per cent (Dollars 1.1bn) of the total. MEG says junior companies are back in force this year and it was obliged to change its cut-off for budgets included in the survey to Dollars 2m instead of the Dollars 1m used in previous years. It estimates that about 85 junior companies not included in its survey may be spending between Dollars 1m and Dollars 2m each on exploration for non-ferrous metals and minerals this year.

Operating revenues were ADollars 276.4m, compared with ADollars 330.9m a year earlier. The move into the red was blamed on weak prices and demand. Renison said that tin prices were more than 20 per cent lower than a year ago while copper was down by 15 per cent, and that prices for titanium dioxide feedstock products were also depressed. The effect of these significantly lower prices was partially offset by strengthening zircon and gold prices, and the Namara open-cast coal mine made a ADollars 6m profits contribution, meeting its contracted sales since the mine started up. But, although there were no abnormals charges in either first-half period, the latest results do include ADollars 3.8m of restructuring costs, related to both the exploration division, which was overhauled during the first half, and the head office. Renison said yesterday that the changes to the exploration side would mean more effort being expended on exploring for gold, base metals and mineral sands in specific regions of Australia. Offshore activities would 'concentrate on the identification of advanced exploration targets'. Its Canberra exploration office is being closed and the division will be managed from Perth. Both the mineral sands and the tin interests were loss-making in the first half as was the Mount Lyell copper mine. On the gold front, the group's interest in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea - which was reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent at end-February 1993 - contributed ADollars 35.7m, compared with ADollars 40m last time.

The deal marks a welcome success for the Transitional Council, which had pledged to end months of delay over the signing and clear the way for more foreign and private sector investment in the sector. Similar deals are expected shortly with other foreign oil companies, including Elf Aquitaine, Mobil Corporation, Chevron and Agip and with the alliance of Statoil and BP, whose Nigerian assets were nationalised in 1979. If exploration agreements were made for the 65 new areas, it would help Nigeria to hit its target of 25bn barrels of recoverable reserves by 1995 with no initial outlay by the government. Shell has set up a new company for exploration and production in new areas, operating purely as a contractor and taking all the risk in developing five new exploration blocks awarded by the government in December 1991. Under the new agreement, there is no guaranteed minimum nor any upper limit on the foreign operator's earnings. The Nigerian government will receive signature bonuses of Dollars 30m each for licensing the two deep offshore blocks and less than Dollars 1m each for three large onshore permits in the Benue basin. The new terms replace the joint ventures with the state-owned National Petroleum Corporation in which foreign companies hold minority stakes. Shortage of cash recently forced NNPC to cut investment in these ventures. Oil Secretary Mr Philip Asiodu said: 'Exploration sharing is better for Nigeria because we can save scarce funds for more pressing needs'. These include the state monopoly on oil refineries and distribution, which is near to collapse, leading to fuel shortages in most parts of Nigeria. The new signing is also a boost for Shell, the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, which has been caught up in controversy as the technical adviser on the delayed Liquefied Natural Gas project.

But the UK independent exploration and production company predicted that output would jump from 14,200 barrels a day at present to 20,000 b/d by 1996. Mr Charles Jamieson, chief executive, said a planned maintenance shutdown last April at the Wytch Farm field in the UK and declining production at the offshore Angus field accounted for much of the fall in net profits. The shutdown caused average first half production to fall to 11,000 b/d, which was reflected in lower turnover of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 26.3m) and operating profit of Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 9.7m). Earnings per share were 12 per cent down at 0.84p (0.95p). The company said three areas - Wytch Farm, the Fife oil field in the North Sea and the Qadirpur gas project in Pakistan - would help boost production to a peak of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 1996. Mr Jamieson said the first successful horizontal well at Wytch Farm extending under Poole Bay would ensure that the company's higher production level would be maintained this year, with Fife and Qadirpur coming fully on stream in coming years. Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said the company was also well placed to carry on with its 'aggressive exploration programme' despite current low oil prices. But the option of 'purchasing reserves is still there,' according to Mr Gerry Orbell, exploration director. He said that although there would be no fall in Premier's overall exploration spending, in the short-term the emphasis would be on lower-risk exploitation and appraisal of existing discoveries.

0,FT943-11958 ,"FT943-11958 _AN-EG1ANAF5FT 940727   FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (10): Fields no longer marginal - Oil and gas exploration      By JAMES HARDING   Hydrocarbon exploration in Tunisia will reach a new high in 1994, with 38 exploration agreements in force and 20 exploration wells expected to be drilled. Uncharitable observers say the surge in exploration is a desperate bid to resurrect the industry after a 10.5 per cent fall in 1993 followed a decade of gradual decline in oil production. Increased domestic energy consumption, combined with falling output from Tunisia's largest oilfields, pushed exports down by 22 per cent to Dollars 23m below oil imports in 1993, forcing Tunisia into a deficit on its oil account for the first time in 20 years. A predicted rise in oil consumption from 3.516m metric tonnes in 1993 to 3.684m tonnes this year indicates that Tunisia will maintain a deficit in 1994. The decline in production is expected to slow, with an official estimate showing a 2.2 per cent drop to 4.545m tonnes in 1994. Gloom, however, is largely unwarranted. A shrewd government policy of enabling the production of marginal or previously unmarketable reserves and fiscal encouragement to explore for further fields will compensate for the decline of Tunisia's original large oil producers. High levels of exploration activity demonstrate international confidence that there are discoveries waiting to be made in Tunisia. And, starting from 1995, a hydrocarbons surplus seems assured with the coming on stream of gas from Miskar in the Gulf of Gabes. The Miskar field was discovered over 20 years ago but despite proven reserves of 33bn cu metres has remained untapped. It was only with the development of a guaranteed domestic market for gas, under- pinned by the transfer to gas-based electricity production and confirmed by a purchase agreement with the Tunisian government covering the lifetime of the field, that it became viable for development. British Gas is now investing Dollars 650m to set up four production platforms offshore, a 120km pipeline and the Hannibal processing plant, outside Sfax, which will remove nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide and then pass the clean gas to power stations at Tunis, Sousse and Gabes. It is thought British Gas could start production as early as April 1995, with four wells open by the end of May, compared with a contractual date of September 1995. Peak production of 160m-180m cu ft a day (or 1.5m tonnes of oil equivalent a year) should be reached in a year and maintained for five to six years, while compression apparatus may be used at the offshore platforms from 1998 to keep output at capacity. The field's estimated life is 18 to 20 years. Tunisia has a lot to gain from Miskar. Gas production, primarily for the domestic energy market, will release a greater volume of oil for export. It will allow Tunisia to transfer more Algerian gas which it has used for domestic electricity generation, increasing its tariff income on the gas pumped through the Transmed pipeline from Algeria to Italy. A scheduled doubling in gas volume through Transmed in 1995 will further increase tariff revenues. The fixed tariff on the Algerian gas and the agreed price for gas from Miskar enable Tunisia to profit from spot trades in the fluctuating international gas market. And, of course, it is hoped that the British Gas project will increase employment in Sfax and develop the domestic skills base in gas production. British Gas, too, is expected to profit from a deal with a lifetime purchase guarantee, albeit at a price linked to oil. However, considering the size of investment for a comparatively small production volume, margins appear precariously narrow. However, the building of a processing plant designed to outlive the Miskar field by as much as 15 years indicates confidence at British Gas that its future in Tunisia will run to more than Miskar. That confidence is shared by a number of British Gas competitors. Despite a squeeze on funds in the last few years following the drop in oil prices, investment in exploration in Tunisia has almost doubled from Dollars 61m in 1988 to a predicted Dollars 120m in 1994. The reason for the high level of exploratory interest, according to Mr Kesraoui, chief executive of Etap, the state manager of the oil and gas sector, is the favourable environment for developing marginal fields. As well as the advantages of moderate labour costs and low transport requirements in a small country like Tunisia, Mr Kesraoui points to the fiscal and legislative regime which enables companies to produce profitably from small finds. The profits-related tax regime, the lowering of royalty and corporation tax rates and the establishment of capital uplifts on certain exploration expenditures have significantly improved the tax burden for international explorers. Not that the oil and gas industries in Tunisia are without any complaints. Government pressure to provide jobs and the demands of the employment codes require foreign companies to show tact and diplomacy in navigating the labour market. Industry observers calculate that Tunisian expectations for labour requirements on the British Gas Hannibal processing plant, for example, may be as much as five times the actual need. The tax regime, as well, is subject to criticism. Companies are taxed by field for their activities in Tunisia, as opposed to on a global basis. Thus, exploration and seismic analysis costs cannot be offset against production profits on fields discovered before 1990. Despite these gripes, the industry shows a healthier complexion than a decade ago. For the 12-year period following the discovery at Ashtart in 1974, there were no significant finds of new oil reserves. However, a discovery at the Ezzaouia field near Zarzis in 1986 was followed by Maamoura in 1988, and Sidi el Kilani in 1989, encouraging an adventurous mood among explorers. Dr Cameron Davies, of Oil Management Services, a hydrocarbon consultant, points out that finds in Tunisia's limestone reservoir 'helped to redirect the thinking of exploration geologists towards unusual reservoirs in chalks, karstified carbonates and hightly fractured limestones.' That new thinking and the fiscal regime have led to the opening and development of a number of small fields. The Belli field discovered in 1991 produces 16,000 barrels of oil a day, Sidi el Kilani averages 10,000 b/d and the Cercena field discovered in 1992 started production in June with 4,000 b/d. These sites are small in comparison with the volume of gas coming on line from Miskar. But encouraging marginal fields in the oil sector is the pragmatic way of regenerating the industry as the old mammoths wither.   Countries:-  TNZ  Tunisia, Africa.

The agreement gives RTZ exploration and potential development rights to half of Burundi's prospective nickel belt which is 300km long and 40km wide in places. This is the first agreement signed by the government of Burundi with a big mining company. However, Burundi is also having talks with Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest natural resources group, about a potential exploration deal covering the other half of the nickel belt. At present RTZ's only nickel interest is the Empress refinery in Zimbabwe which toll refines about 6,000 tonnes a year of the metal for BCL, Botswana. An RTZ official pointed out that its exploration policy excluded no commodity but the group was interested only in world-class deposits. The deal with Burundi followed an RTZ review of the mining potential in African countries, carried out since 1990. Most of the potential resources are nickel but Burundi also has deposits of gold, phosphate and industrial minerals such as kaolin and cement raw materials.   Companies:-  RTZ Corp.

This is in spite of the UK continental shelf now being a mature area for oil and gas production. Between this year and 1997 annual spending on existing and new fields should fall by less than Pounds 1bn from this year's level of Pounds 8.5bn, says Scottish Enterprise, the development body, which yesterday published its biennial forecasts for UK and worldwide petroleum activity. The forecasts contrast with those Scottish Enterprise made in 1991, which suggested a rather steeper decline in spending on exploration, development and operations from an all-time peak in 1991. In that year spending in the UK continental shelf was Pounds 9.3bn. The continued high level of development spending, measured in 1993 prices, follows the record levels of exploration and appraisal reached in 1990, when 214 wells were drilled. Only 137 exploration and appraisal wells were started last year and Scottish Enterprise does not expect more than 105 to be drilled each year up to 1997. The study suggests this is partly due to the removal in the March Budget of petroleum revenue tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. About 41 new oil or gas fields are expected to come on stream in the northern North Sea and 29 in the southern sector between 1993 and 1997. But many new fields will use lower-cost subsea technology rather than platforms, while gas will make up an increasing proportion of the new fields coming into production. Oil output is expected to reach almost 2.5m barrels of oil a day in 1995, compared with 2m a day this year. After 1995 output will fall back slightly. About 20 per cent of future commercial fields in the North Sea have been delayed by more than a year because of an abundance of new supplies and weak oil prices, according to Arthur Andersen Petroleum Services.

The contract awards exploration rights for six years over an 880,000-hectare (2.2m-acre) area of the Peruvian Amazon, attractive for its proximity to the north eastern oil pipeline. Occidental is Peru's oldest established private operator, responsible for almost half of the country's present crude output of about 120,000 barrels a day. The signing underlines a new willingness by the Peruvian state to speed up approval for contracts with private operators. Petroperu's president, Mr Jaime Quijandria, points out that Peru, although almost virgin territory in oil terms, 'is not the only petroleum-rich country in the region, nor the most important. We have to compete for investment with Ecuador and Colombia to name but two'. Petroperu aims to sign exploration contracts worth a total of at least USDollars 110m a year until the end of the century, according to Mr Quijandria. This will boost both the flagging reserves position and current output. 'Peru must aim at supplying all its internal oil requirements and becoming a medium-sized exporter,' he says.

0,FT941-11293 ,"FT941-11293 _AN-EBDDEAGLFT 940204   FT  04 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yemen's 'secrets' continue to elude oilmen - Explorers remain hopeful, though new finds are getting smaller      By ERIC WATKINS   Mr Bernard Isautier, president of Canadian Occidental Petroleum, remains sanguine about Yemen's oil industry despite a general decrease in the size of new discoveries and increasing costs of further exploration. He insists that much potential remains in Yemen, while acknowledging that more information is needed before 'the secrets' of the region can be disclosed. 'We are maintaining an active exploration programme in the concession area where we are already producing. There are smaller structures still to be tested and we are actively pursuing these since they are close to our facilities,' Mr Isautier said. With depressed oil prices affecting exploration budgets CanadianOxy is currently placing less emphasis on the possibility of large discoveries in remote areas of its 37,500-square-km concession and more on smaller finds that can be joined economically to its existing facilities. Located at al-Masila in southern Yemen, CanadianOxy's oil fields and central processing facility are linked by a 138km pipeline extending southwards to export facilities at Ash-Shihr on the Gulf of Aden coast. Since coming on stream in late September 1993 the company has announced recoverable reserves of 546m barrels and has reached an average production rate of 135,000 barrels a day, about a third of Yemen's total output. Although Mr Isautier doubts that the company's production will increase substantially from existing fields in the coming year he is optimistic about other possible finds in the area. 'There is still upside potential particularly in the fractured basement,' he said, referring to the hard rock foundations underlying porous limestone formations where oil is usually found. 'We now have one well producing 8,000 barrels a day of natural flow, a higher quality oil, and flowing under very steady, stable pressure. That is indicative of a large well connected area and it's very encouraging,' he says. CanadianOxy is meanwhile trading information with other companies adjacent to its concession area, particularly Clyde, Lasmo, and Nimir, all of which are working to the north and north-east of the al-Masila fields. In the current climate of cost effectiveness, traded data saves on exploration costs and could be especially important for CanadianOxy. 'If those companies make significant discoveries, that would suggest more potential in the eastern portions of our concession,' says a company executive. Based on CanadianOxy's discoveries, oilmen have long suspected a trend running through the region. But confirmation has so far eluded them. Last April, Total announced a find capable of yielding 12,000 b/d to the east of al-Masila and to the north Clyde is currently evaluating results after a recent strike along its concession line with CanadianOxy. But Lasmo is now said to have drilled three dry holes, while Nimir has just begun its drilling programme. As prospects of large discoveries diminish, oil companies will gradually have to adjust their exploration programmes, gearing their efforts to smaller finds near existing facilities to ensure commerciality. But oilmen insist that even such modest exploration efforts may be uneconomical under present production-sharing agreements with the Yemeni government. 'The government has tended to think in terms of quick large-scale finds and has negotiated contracts accordingly,' one says. 'That means small finds become commercially unattractive and that, in turn, puts a damper on further exploration.' But there are signs already that the government is adjusting to the new conditions, announcing last month extensions in the exploration agreements of Shell and Clyde. With concession areas ranging from 7,000 to 40,000 sq km, the added time should enable companies to explore larger portions of their territory and to evaluate more carefully the data they gather. CanadianOxy has now been in the country seven years and, as Mr Isautier points out: 'We still have a lot of ideas to work on to determine the ultimate potential of our fields'.

0,FT931-8557 ,"FT931-8557 _AN-DBRCKAF2FT 930218   FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China invites explorers to prime oil areas      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   AFTER YEARS of procrastination China yesterday invited foreign oil companies to explore in promising onshore areas, including the vast Tarim basin in the country's remote north-west. Mr Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corporation, said yesterday that exploration bids for five blocs covering 72,730 square km (28,000 square miles) in the south-eastern sector of the Tarim basin would be called in March. There would be a second round of bidding for additional acreage by early next year, he said. Worries about flagging domestic production - China may become a net importer by 1995 - and the need to speed exploration in remote areas apparently dispelled lingering reservations about opening up territory to foreign explorers. The booming economy - GNP growth reached 12 per cent last year - is putting added strain on dwindling oil reserves. Oil company representatives welcomed China's decision to open its 'wild west' to exploration - Shell and BP in particular expressed strong interest  -but they indicated caution about commiting resources to such a remote region. Transporting oil to the coast would require a 2,000 km pipeline across some of the world's roughest terrain. Many offshore explorers had their fingers badly burnt in China in the 1980s. A representative of Australia's BHP Petroleum noted ruefully yesterday that the company had drilled 23 dry wells in the Yellow Sea and the Pearl River Delta. China had previously allowed foreign participation in onshore exploration, but restricted this to relatively unpromising areas in 11 southern provinces. The extension of foreign exploration leases to northern and western regions is certain to excite considerable explorers'interest. Based on fairly sketchy seismic data, China claims that the Tarim basin contains massive reserves of perhaps more than 100bn barrels. Even if only a fraction of such deposits are recoverable at reasonable cost the region would become one of the world biggest oilfields. Mr Wang Tao also announced the opening of existing oilfields to foreign participation. China's 'mature' fields face increasing difficulties maintaining production without sophisticated enhancement techniques. China at present produces about 2.8m barrels a day and its exports are hovering around 400,000 b/d. The country ranks sixth in the world in oil production.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.

The LAFAS-1 spectrometer, in which the source of resonance  radiation is a dye laser excited by the radiation of an excimer  XeCl laser, was used. The spectrometer is fully described in the  literature and briefly in this article. The sampling method and  method for preparing the samples are described in detail. Ice  cylinders 6-10 cm in diameter and 15-30 cm high were extracted.  There was excellent agreement between the results of Pb and Cd  measurements made by the LAFS method and the two classical  methods. However, the sensitivity of the LAFS method is several  orders of magnitude greater than the other methods. With the  LAFAS-1 all three elements were measured with sample volumes  20æm (Pb) and 50 æm (Cd, Bi). In the traditional method a  much longer time was required in the sampling and the samples  had to be much larger. There are three principal sources of  entry of heavy metals into the atmosphere: wind erosion of the  soil surface, volcanic ejecta and microspray from the ocean  surface. The contribution of different sources is examined in  detail in the example of Pb. Figures 2; references 21: 20  Russian, 1 Western.     "

The executives, in interviews at the annual meeting of the American Petroleum  Institute, said they are basing their plans for modest increases in spending  next year on expectations that oil prices will stabilize in the low  $20s-per-barrel range once the crisis is resolved.    Such prices would be higher than before Iraq invaded Kuwait, but lower than  they are now.    On Monday, crude oil for December delivery closed down $2.02 a barrel at $31.87  in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.    Although increased oil revenues have prompted some companies -- including  Unocal Corp. and Chevron Corp. -- to speed up drilling plans, executives said  their long-range strategies remained unaffected by the crisis, which has driven  prices as high as $40 in recent months.    ""This is a long-term business, and you don't turn the money on because the oil  price spikes,"" said Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp.    Although spending plans vary from company to company, many of the executives  said they would boost spending on exploration and production of oil,  particularly overseas. In refining and marketing, there is a complicating  factor as oil companies prepare their 1991 budgets: the unknown costs of  retrofitting refineries to meet requirements of the proposed federal clean air  act.    Rawl said Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, would probably spend a  little more than the $8.3 billion it expects to spend in 1990.    Exxon plans few changes in its current allocations, with about 20% to 25% of  the budget going to refining and marketing, 10% to chemicals and the rest to  exploration and production. About 65% of Exxon's exploration and production  budget is spent overseas, the rest in the United States.    As for the effects that the clean air act might have on spending, he said Exxon  had not placed a figure on it -- ""but it's going to cost a lot.""    No. 2 Mobil Corp. will spend more than $6 billion in 1990, considerably higher  than before, said Chairman Allen E. Murray, who also is API's board chairman.    ""We have a very aggressive budget that we adopted for the year 1990, one of the  highest we've ever had, because we think things look good for the oil industry,  and the basics seem to be coming back into line,"" Murray said.    But for next year, he added, ""if you're asking me if I'm suddenly going to set  our exploration people loose assuming (that the price of oil is $40 a barrel),  the answer is we are not.""    Texaco Inc. plans to spend about $3.1 billion in 1991, an increase over 1990's  estimated $2.9 billion and 1989's $2.3 billion, said James W. Kinnear,  president and chief executive. About two-thirds of that will go to exploration  and production, he said. Texaco will spend another $600 million through  affiliated companies, he added.    Chevron Corp.'s 1990 capital spending will come in at $4 billion. Next year,  ""it will be up a not-insignificant amount,"" said Chairman Kenneth T. Derr.    Much of the exploration and production money will go overseas, he said.    He estimated that the company also must spend more than $500 million in the  next five years just to meet initial requirements of the clean air act, though  he declined to guess total costs.    British Petroleum will increase capital expenditures ""something more than  inflation"" from current levels of about $6.5 billion worldwide, said James  Ross, president of subsidiary BP America Inc.    Ross expects spending in the United States, which is more than $2 billion a  year, to go up slightly next year.    At Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., ""we're going to be drilling more  wells next year, so our spending will be up some,"" said Chairman Lodwrick M.  Cook.    He estimated that spending would increase to around $3.5 billion, with  expenditures heavily weighted to Arco's U.S. operations in Alaska and the lower  48 states.    Unocal Corp. will boost capital spending more than $1.1 billion above 1990's,  said Chairman Richard J.

Philippine officials in May gave the green light to Alcorn  Petroleum and Minerals Corp. and US partner Vaalco Energy Inc.  of Houston, to begin preliminary exploration work on the Reed  Bank, an undersea structure near the South China Sea chain.    The six-month, non-exclusive contract includes ""research and  library work"" on aeromagnetic surveys and other data held by the  Department of Energy.    Philippine energy officials insist the area where the  exploration would be conducted is not part of the Spratlys -- a  chain of atolls in the South China Sea claimed wholly by China  and in part by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and  Vietnam.    The Spratlys are believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil  and natural gas and also straddle strategic sea lanes. All  claimants but Brunei have stationed troops on islets in the  chain.    Analysts say Manila's recent move would strengthen its  sovereignty over islets, reefs and atolls it has garrisoned, but  could also have a political and diplomatic impact on efforts to  peacefully resolve the territorial dispute and suggestions for  joint development of the area.    ""It's a response to what the Chinese and Malaysians are  doing,"" Julius Cesar Parrenas, director of the International  Institute for Strategic Studies, told AFP.    He was referring to Beijing's granting of a contract to the  US-based Crestone Energy Corp. to explore for oil in the area,  prompting vehement protests from Vietnam. Malaysia has also  embarked on a project to develop a resort in the Spratlys.    ""One means of strengthening sovereignty is by already having  activity there, such as a contract of government or development  plans,"" he said, adding that exploration was a good move by the  Philippines.    Noel Morada, an analyst with the Institute for Strategic and  Development Studies, said what is crucial to the Philippines'  move is the reaction of China and Vietnam.    ""Since we are taking this particular action, we should be  prepared of the possible consequences,"" he said. ""This is an  economic move which has political implications.""    Energy Secretary Delfin Lazaro and Undersecretary Rufino  Bomasang on Tuesday sought to forestall trouble by insisting the  permit granted to Alcorn was limited to the Reed Bank and did  not include areas in the Spratlys.    The Reed Bank is an underwater structure between the  Philippine island of Palawan and most of the Spratlys.    Lazaro and Bomasang said Manila had done exploratory  drilling  there in the 1970s, which had not been disputed by other  claimants, adding that political and diplomatic repurcussions  had been considered before the permit was granted.    Alcorn said in a statement the research permit only covered  the Reed Bank and excluded the disputed areas of the Spratlys.    But the statement said the area of coverage also includes  Patag and Lawak islands -- two of the eight small islands and  reefs garrisoned by Philippine marines and collectively referred  to by Manila as the Kalayaan (Freedom) group.    The group was annexed in a presidential decree by the late  dictator Ferdinand Marcos.    The Philippines has become an attractive site for oil  exploration with news of recent oil strikes off Palawan,  confirming the country's potential. It has programmed 18 wells  for drilling this year, many in frontier areas.     "

IP is buying Jamestone Exploration, the main shareholder in which is Mr James Hamilton, a South African geologist. Mr Jamestone has in turn exercised an option on a property previously held by Britain's RTZ, near the Northam platinum mine in the western Transvaal. Mr Glen Varty, IP's president, said that IP is now looking for a partner to carry out further drilling work on the property. Part of the funds for the exploration work will come from the proceeds of a recent CDollars 305,000 (Pounds 150,000) private placement, which has resulted in an Australian company, Turnbull Doyle Resources of Melbourne, acquiring a 20 per cent stake in IP. The chairman of Turnbull Doyle is Mr Neville Wran, who was premier of New South Wales from 1976 to 1986. IP, which is listed on the Toronto stock exchange and on Nasdaq, has nine platinum exploration properties in Canada and the US state of Michigan. But Mr Varty said that with the improved political situation in South Africa, 'it's attractive to be back down there'.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

The agreement gives Amoco Romania Petroleum, a subsidiary of Amoco Production Company, rights to a 750 sq km (290 sq miles) area in the Carpathian Mountains about 60 km (37 miles) north-east of Bucharest, which Amoco won after an international tender in September 1990. A Canadian Occidental/Enterprise Oil combine, which won two offshore sites in the Black Sea and, Shell, which successfully bid for an area in Transylvania, are due to sign similar contracts within the next 10 days. The western companies are expected to invest about Dollars 90m in the next three years as part of an initial five-year exploration period. However, Rompetrol said developing the sites in the event of commercial finds could could cost more than Dollars 2.4bn. Rompetrol retains the right to acquire up to 20 per cent in any development, with the western companies, which have received substantial tax concessions from the Romanian government, free to export their share of production. Mr David Work, vice-president of Amoco Production, said the agreement was consistent with the company's strategy of investing in areas with known hydrocarbon potential. The deal, which was held up for several months until the Romanian parliament passed enabling legislation, is Amoco's first exploration agreement in central Europe. Existing wells in Romania, historically one of central Europe's major oil-producing areas, were heavily exploited under the Ceausescu regime. However, the dictator's obsession with paying off the national debt kept the Romanian oil industry short of funds for further exploration, contributing to a drop in domestic crude oil production from more than 12m tonnes in 1979 to 6.8m tonnes last year. SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil producer, said yesterday its Snorre oil and gas field had come on stream six weeks earlier than planned and NKr1.5bn (Pounds 135m) below budget at a cost of NKr16.6bn, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Recoverable oil reserves are put at 770m barrels. Production will be gradually built up beyond 100,000 barrels a day by the end of the year, by which time production from a seabed installation will have come on stream, allowing production capacity of 190,000 b/d to be reached early next year. Snorre is providing Saga's first production from a field that it operates. It has been developed with the Norwegian North Sea's first tension leg platform, the biggest of its kind in the world. Oil and gas is processed at the nearby Statfjord field, with oil tanker loaded and gas exported further via the Statpipe line to the European continent.  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

BP's presentation coincided with news of an exciting gas discovery off the coast of Vietnam, a story which had been circulating in the market for some time, and went down very well with analysts. One of the leading oil sector researchers described the presentation, delivered by Mr John Browne, head of BP's exploration and production, as the best he had ever attended and the first time BP 'has ever demonstrated a credible long term growth plan in exploration; in the past, BP has talked about managing a decline in its exploration business, today it was full of information on its expansion plans'. Another analyst said he was 'well satisfied' with the presentation but added that he would like to see evidence of renewed US support for BP shares. BP will deliver the same message to US investors today. BP ended 3 up at 420 1/2 p on turnover of 9.3m. Shell improved marginally to 722 1/2 p.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

0,FT941-6551 ,"FT941-6551 _AN-ECAD7AFPFT 940301   FT  01 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway desperate to head off slide in oil output      By KAREN FOSSLI      OSLO   Norway's Labour government is proposing a comprehensive overhaul of energy policy in a desperate attempt to stimulate petroleum activities and stem a steep decline in crude oil production after 1996. The country is western Europe's biggest oil producer with daily output of 2.4m barrels, and is the fourth biggest crude oil exporter in the world. Oil companies argue the best way to boost activities is to ease the stringent tax regime. But in a White Paper presented last Friday to the Storting, Norway's parliament, the controversial tax issue went unmentioned. In the White Paper, the government recommended that exploration acreage be expanded by 16 per cent and rules for exploring in the Barents Sea be reformed to make it more attractive. It also intends to speed up the process for approving oil discoveries. A number of proposals were made to streamline licensing rules and management of the state's oil and gas resources. Environmentalists and fisherman fiercely oppose the move to expand exploration to the Skagerrak, about 50km off the southern coast of Norway, and to new areas of the Norwegian Sea, off the coast of mid-Norway. Under the proposals, in the Skagerrak, just four exploration wells will be allowed to be drilled; only one rig will be allowed to work in the area at a time; and, drilling during the summer - peak harvest season for prawns - has been ruled out. In the Norwegian Sea, six wells will be allowed in the Nordland VI area during a limited period of the year with just one rig operating at a time. In the Barents Sea, where 52 wells have so far failed to yield any commercial discoveries, changes to licensing conditions have been proposed to cut the cost of exploring there. Norway has little choice but to stimulate oil activity; not only will output decline dramatically in two years time, from a peak of 2.6m barrels a day, but the country is also faced with stiffer competition for oil company investment. Last year Norway boosted recoverable petroleum reserves by 259m tonnes of oil equivalent to 5.89bn tonnes, but the increase was due to adjustments to reserves of producing fields and discoveries not yet developed, rather than to exploration success. Out of a total of 18 wildcat exploration wells drilled in 1993, just three small discoveries were made, yielding only 9m tonnes. . . an 'unsatisfactory result', says the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the industry watchdog, and far less than in the previous two years. Investment in the petroleum sector is forecast to fall dramatically in two years from about NKr60bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in 1993 unless new oil fields are discovered. The size of new discoveries is expected to diminish to an average 20m tonnes of oil equivalent, compared with 90m tonnes for fields now producing 40m tonnes for those now being developed. Blocks located within the new acreage are to be offered for licence application by the beginning of next year, with award by the start of 1996. This timetable, says the government, could enable development to commence by 2005 with first production in 2010.   Countries:-  NOZ  Norway, West Europe.

Before the signing ceremony, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing  met with representatives of the five overseas firms: the Italian  Agip, the French Elf, the Japanese Energy Corporation, the  Japanese Petroleum Exploration Company and Texaco of the U.S.A.    The contract is the second one on petroleum prospecting and  exploration in the Tarim Basin. It is also the second one in  China's world-wide public tendering for cooperation in  exploiting China's land oil.    Under the new contract, the foreign firms will for the next  eight years shoulder all the expenses and risks in prospecting;  when oil and gas fields are found, the two sides will jointly  invest in exploration and production, and share the crude oil in  proportions laid down by the contract.    It is learned that since March 1 last year, when the China  National Petroleum Corporation opened the first round of public  tendering for the project, 68 corporations from 17 countries had  applied for the tendering documents and 54 of them had sent  representatives to Beijing to study relevant materials.    The south-eastern area of the Tarim Basin open for  cooperation consists of five sectors covered mainly by sand.     "

Chevron, meanwhile, saw operating earnings drop in both upstream and downstream operations. Earnings reports from the big US oil groups this week have generally reflected an increase in earnings from exploration and production on the back of higher oil prices. Profit margins from refining and marketing, although below the high levels of a year ago, have caused less damage to earnings than generally expected, giving a fillip to oil stocks. Texaco's shares climbed Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 63 while Exxon rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 60 7/8 . Shares in Mobil, meanwhile, jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 83 1/4 , following an announcement that the company was moving ahead with a restructuring programme to reduce costs. At Texaco, international exploration and production profits rose to Dollars 83m from Dollars 15m a year ago (before one-off items). This was due to higher production of both oil and natural gas in the UK sector of the North Sea, lower exploration expenses and higher oil prices, the company said. Upstream income in the US slipped to Dollars 127m from Dollars 138m. Marketing and refining profits, meanwhile, slid to Dollars 167m from Dollars 200m. After one-off items in both periods, Texaco reported net income of Dollars 281m, down from Dollars 317m in the 1993 period. At 98 cents a share, earnings were well ahead of most forecasts. Chevron, meanwhile, said earnings in upstream operations to Dollars 255m in the latest period fell from Dollars 332m, while downstream businesses recorded a fall to Dollars 163m from Dollars 243m (all figures are before one-off items). Although operating earnings rebounded from the second quarter, benefiting from higher refined product margins in the US and the absence of refinery operating problems, overall profit margins fell short of the strong 1993 third quarter, said Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief executive. One bright spot was provided by Chevron's chemical business, which reported earnings of Dollars 68m, up from Dollars 6m a year ago. Net income overall was Dollars 425m, or 65 cents a share, compared with Dollars 420m, or 64 cents a share, in the 1993 period.   Companies:-  Texaco Inc.     Chevron Corp.

0,FT931-3231 ,"FT931-3231 _AN-DCQCCAB6FT 930317   FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP steps up Chinese exploration efforts      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   BROKEN HILL Proprietary, the Australian steel and resources giant, is stepping up its involvement in China with new explorations ventures in oil and minerals. But its chairman, Mr Brian Loton, says the company is proceeding cautiously in a complex market. Speaking in Beijing at the weekend, Mr Loton said BHP's approach to China would be 'practical and hard-nosed', but at the same it recognised the growth of new opportunities now that the country was 'opening up'. The BHP chairman, who has tended to be regarded by company insiders as a 'China-sceptic', was visiting Beijing to assess an expanding range of options for BHP in both the resources and oil and gas sectors. He was received by Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, one of the Chinese leaders responsible for economic management, and officials of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries. Mr Loton said that representatives of BHP Petroleum would be visiting China later this month to examine possible involvement in exploration of the vast Tarim basin in the north-west, which has recently been opened to foreign companies and may have reserves to match those of Saudi Arabia. He stressed, however, that BHP on its own did not have the resources necessary to explore China's desert wastes. This indicated that BHP might join forces with an oil major in a Tarim basin venture. BHP's experiences looking for oil in China had not been encouraging, Mr Loton noted. It had, for example, drilled 23 dry wells in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River delta in a consortium with British Petroleum. He added, nevertheless, that these setbacks had 'not dimmed our enthusiasm,' and that BHP was either actively engaged in exploration or was evaluating opportunities in several offshore areas. These included the Bohai Gulf in northern Chinese waters, the South China Sea and areas off Hainan island in the south. BHP was also expected to bid for blocks in the East China Sea off Shanghai in June. The company was also spending about ADollars 4m to evaluate a lead/zinc prospect in Sichuan province in China's centre-west. This venture marks something of a first for a foreign company in the strategic minerals and metals area. China has tended to guard jealously its minerals and onshore oil and gas resources from foreign involvement, but with demands from the leadership for speedier economic development, officials are now beginning actively to seek assistance abroad. Mr Loton said that his company had no immediate plans for further minerals exploration ventures, but he also noted that China recognised the expertise of companies like BHP in both looking for and exploiting mineral deposits. China has barely scratched the surface of its minerals assets across a vast country. An obsession with gold - in the past two decades about 70 per cent of China's exploration resources were devoted to looking for the metal - has been a serious drag on overall minerals development. BHP's chairman and his fellow executives were bullish about the company's iron ore sales to China, which they expected would rise by about 10 per cent to some 5m tonnes in 1993. The sales are being driven by the extraordinary growth in the Chinese economy in the past year of 12.8 per cent, well up on revised growth targets of 9 per cent. China produced 78m tonnes of steel last year, making it the world's number three producer. It is aiming for 100m tonnes a year by 2000, which represents continuing good news for BHP and other Australian iron ore suppliers.   Companies:-  Broken Hill Pty.     BHP Petroleum.

0,FT944-9108 ,"FT944-9108 _AN-EKQEIABBFT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / Venezuela opens its oil sector to private capital: Exploration tenders sought for first time since nationalisation in 1976      By JOSEPH MANN   Venezuela's national oil company has developed a programme to open its exploration and production sectors to private capital for the first time since the oil industry was nationalised in 1976. Petroleos de Venezuela, PDVSA, plans to seek tenders on profit-sharing contracts, under which private companies will be allowed to explore about 10 geographical areas onshore and offshore. Successful companies must finance all exploration themselves. If commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas are discovered, the private investor will then set up a joint venture with one of PDVSA's operating subsidiaries  -Corpoven, Lagoven or Maraven - to develop the new fields and market the oil internationally. If no oil or gas is found in commercial quantities, the private party bears the loss. The PDVSA plan must still be approved by the cabinet of President Rafael Caldera and by a joint session of the Venezuelan Congress. PDVSA officials expect no big problems. PDVSA, one of the world's largest oil companies, has extensive proven reserves of heavy crude oil and bitumen, but wants to boost its reserves of higher-value light and medium crudes to stay competitive internationally. At end-1993, PDVSA's proven reserves of crude oil stood at 64.5bn barrels, the largest in the western hemisphere. Executives at PDVSA say geological and seismic studies indicate that the country still has large, undiscovered deposits of light and medium crude oils. Exploration of the most promising areas by PDVSA on its own would require capital investments of Dollars 6bn-8bn, taking more than 25 years. However, PDVSA expects that if private investors join the effort to find oil, exploration of these same areas could be completed in 10 years, with all exploration investment paid for by private companies. The areas to be put up for tender could hold between 7bn and 23bn barrels of light/medium crudes, plus 10,000bn cubic feet of gas, according to estimates made by PDVSA after a British Petroleum survey. Winning bidders will be chosen on the basis of how much of their future after-tax profits they are willing to hand over to the state if they find oil and gas. PDVSA says that according to risk contacts offered in other countries, the state keeps between 71 and 88 per cent of after-tax earnings, with the remainder going to private investors. In developing its proposals, PDVSA has been mindful of the failure of this year's round of oil and gas tenders in neighbouring Colombia. But while international oil companies such as Exxon, Shell, BP, Amoco and others have shown considerable interest in the Venezuelan plan, they have some reservations. For example, some would prefer a transparent mechanism that would reduce their payments to the state to encourage them to develop profitably any smaller, more remote fields. The government is working on a plan which would offer possible post facto reductions in royalty payments in such cases. Companies have also expressed concern about government policy, including strict controls on foreign exchange transactions and the suspension of constitutional rights to private property. PDVSA and the government are working on possible solutions. PDVSA managers point out, for example, that when investors are ready to repatriate profits, probably in several years, exchange controls should have been lifted or softened. 'Venezuela is without doubt one of the most attractive countries for risk investment in exploration,' said the local representative of a US oil company. 'If PDVSA can work out the kinks, they should receive a strong response from bidders, and could obtain several billion dollars in exploration and development capital over the next decade.' Venezuela has been slowly opening up its nationalised oil industry for the last few years. Under the previous government, private oil companies were allowed to produce crude and natural gas under operating contracts in so-called marginal (relatively small) oil fields. But in these cases, the operator is paid on a per-barrel basis by PDVSA; the oil does not belong to the private investor and must be turned over to PDVSA. Several important joint ventures between PDVSA units and foreign companies have been established in producing natural gas and upgrading heavy oil, but none has begun to operate. Until now, exploration for and production of crude oil (for eventual sale) had been off limits to private investors.   Companies:-  Petroleos de Venezuela.

0,FT931-1331 ,"FT931-1331 _AN-DCYCKAEWFT 930325   FT  25 MAR 93 / BP defends oil tax from attacks: Rig owners reject BP claims  -Warning of further closures / Capacity exceeds orders      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   BRITISH Petroleum yesterday attacked claims by other oil operators that tax changes announced by the chancellor in the Budget would severely curtail North Sea activity. But oil rig owners said yesterday that four drilling programmes had already been cancelled since last Tuesday, when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, proposed to reduce the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, and to abolish tax allowances for exploration and appraisal work. Today representatives from Amerada Hess, the North Sea exploration company, are to meet Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury. The company, one of the most active in North Sea exploration, has threatened to halve its exploration programme this year if the government insists on its proposed changes to the tax regime. The divergent views of the winners and losers in the largest overhaul of North Sea taxes for 10 years are generating a serious row in the oil industry over how to respond to Mr Lamont's proposals. Mr John Browne, ex-ploration director at BP, said the attacks on the proposed changes by the UK Offshore Operators' Association, the industry group, were 'hasty and inappropriate.' Mr Browne said the tax reforms were overdue. The taxpayer had spent 30 years subsidising what has sometimes been wasteful oil exploration. BP says the proportion of wells drilled which result in commercial oil finds has dropped in the past five years from one in four to one in seven. The proposals would give exploration work a stronger focus and make it more cost-effective, he said, and the reduction in the tax rate for existing fields would encourage companies to improve recovery of oil. 'Even the most efficient fields leave 40 per cent of the oil in the ground. Many of those older fields would be nearing depletion by the end of the decade. They will now have a longer life,' he said. One analyst estimated that the industry as a whole could recover 500m to 1bn barrels from existing fields given the incentive of lower taxes. BP is a net beneficiary of the changes - analysts estimate they could add as much as Pounds 140m a year to its profits. The company has the third-largest drilling programme in the North Sea and is set to spend Pounds 90m on exploration this year. Mr Browne said much more oil could be recovered from existing fields than will be found in small discoveries of 10m to 20m barrels. He said the changes would help bring new areas, such as the recent west-of-Shetlands discovery, on stream more quickly. However, owners of drilling rigs have written to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and to Mr Lamont warning of the consequences of the proposals. Mr Mike Salter, chief executive of Smedvig, a drilling rig operator, and chairman of the British Rig Owners Association, said the proposals would increase the number of rigs idle and crews out of work. He said 40 per cent of drilling rigs in the North Sea were already idle. Exploration work fell 32 per cent last year because of low oil prices and high costs.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

That compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 1.2m, a figure restated to conform with accounting changes which forced the company to write off Pounds 80m of previously unsuccessful exploration expenditure. Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the rights issue would give the company a cash cushion following the go-ahead of its development of the Gryphon field in the North Sea later this year. 'This is a major sea-change within Clyde - we're moving to the fast track development of Gryphon,' he said. Originally, Gryphon was due to come on stream in 1996 but Clyde now plans to start production in the final quarter of this year. That would involve investment of Pounds 90m - Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in Gryphon - this year which would push the company's debt to equity ratio to over 100 per cent. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said: 'We're at a peak of our expenditure this year and the rights issue will help keep that under control'. The rights issue, of 79.86m shares on a 1-for-4 basis, will give the company the flexibility to continue its exploration programme overseas while it proceeds with UK developments. Clyde is also involved in the offshore development of the Wytch Farm oilfield in Dorset, the Stirling oilfield and several gas fields in the Netherlands. Some 90 per cent of the company's commercial reserves will come on stream by 1994. Cashflow will increase to Pounds 350m next year as the company's production rises to 55,000 barrels a day in the second quarter from a current level of 23,874 b/d. With the strong cashflow, the company plans to pay down its debt quickly and reduce gearing from the 100 per cent level to 60 per cent by 1994 and 15 per cent by the end of 1996. The company is looking at break-even this year with possibly a small profit or loss. For 1994, when it hopes to return to profit, it plans to pay an interim dividend of 0.5p followed by a final of 1p. Clyde is continuing its exploration efforts in the Yemen and Syria as well as some small developments in the Netherlands. Turnover for 1992 dropped to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 87.2m). COMMENT Investors taking up the rights issue are demonstrating their faith in the management to continue growing the company beyond its production peak in 1994. But at 44p a share, the rights issue is priced at a discount to the company's net asset value, which is estimated to be between 50p and 56p a share. The company will reach a peak in production and see a big increase in earnings and cashflow in the next few years. But investors must ask how sustainable this is. Clyde is clearly hoping for good exploration success in the Yemen, the results of which will become apparent towards the end of the year. Without good success in exploration, the company will be looking at making an acquisition over the next 18 months. Investors should be able to bank on a dividend in 1994, but they will be hoping to see some clear evidence of oil discoveries before then.   Companies:-  Clyde Petroleum.

Net income for the quarter was Dollars 666m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, compared with Dollars 413m, or Dollars 1, a year earlier. Excluding one-time net gains of Dollars 53m in the latest quarter and a special charge of Dollars 25m a year earlier, Mobil said operating earnings rose 40 per cent to Dollars 613m, or Dollars 1.50. Mobil's US marketing and refining operations earned Dollars 139m in the quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 19m a year earlier. The company attributed the improvement partly to better industry margins. Overseas, marketing and refining brought in earnings of Dollars 215m, up Dollars 130m, led by a strong performance in the Pacific Rim. Results in Europe were better than last year, but continued to reflect the impact of recession. Cost-cutting measures also helped earnings.

A sharp drop in crude oil prices was only partly offset by higher natural gas prices and lower administrative expenses. International exploration and producing earnings dropped Dollars 61m to Dollars 255m reflecting lower crude oil and natural gas prices and reduced European natural gas volumes. Earnings from chemicals slid Dollars 15m to Dollars 9m. The company blamed sluggish economies and industry oversupply for the low margins on polyethylene and films. During the quarter, Mobil's corporate and other expenses rose Dollars 11m to Dollars 47m but financing expenses were Dollars 10m lower at Dollars 68m, reflecting a lower debt level and lower interest rates. Amoco, the Chicago-based energy company, posted third-quarter net income of Dollars 520m, or Dollars 1.05, against Dollars 496m, or Dollars 1 a year ago. Stripping out one-time items in both years, Amoco's operating earnings slipped to Dollars 446m, or 90 cents from Dollars 454m, or 92 cents last year. Lower crude oil prices and production volume depressed earnings from US exploration and production, to Dollars 156m from Dollars 253m last time. Outside of the US, exploration and production earned Dollars 62m, including a one-time gain of Dollars 70m, compared with Dollars 107m a year earlier, including tax benefits of Dollars 23m. Refining, marketing and transportation earned Dollars 225m in the quarter, compared with Dollars 143m.   Companies:-  Mobil Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT932-8287 ,"FT932-8287 _AN-DESCQAHIFT 930519   FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigeria signs deal with BP-Statoil alliance      By PAUL ADAMS and KAREN FOSSLI      LAGOS, OSLO   NIGERIA YESTERDAY signed an oil exploration and production-sharing contract with the alliance between BP and Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, for three deep offshore blocks south-west of the Niger Delta. It was the third agreement in a month by a foreign oil group to take all the risks in developing new fields since shortage of cash forced the government to stop taking majority stakes in exploration joint ventures. After initial resistance to the terms offered by Nigeria's ruling transitional council this year, the foreign oil companies are falling into line following last month's signing by Royal Dutch/Shell and Elf of France. Exxon of the US is to sign a similar deal on Friday. The contract marks the return of BP to active exploration in Nigeria after an absence since 1979, when its Nigerian assets were nationalised. It was welcomed by Mr Philip Asiodu, the oil minister, who said at the signing in Lagos: 'We are all sorry that matters political led to a rupture'. The structure is estimated to hold reserves of at least 250m barrels and could have as much as 1bn barrels. BP-Statoil will pay a signature bonus of USDollars 42m and are committed to investing a minimum of Dollars 65m over the next six years. Seismic tests will begin this year and the first discovery is expected by the end of 1994. Mr Asiodu said that Nigerian law would be amended by August to allow more favourable terms for the increased risk taken by foreign oil companies in the new contracts. For deep offshore exploration the petroleum profit tax will be cut to 50 per cent, the investment tax credit will be 50 per cent and royalties to NNPC, the state-owned petroleum corporation, will be on a sliding scale from 16 per cent to zero, according to depth. Similar amendments will be made to terms for contracts covering onshore blocks. The BP-Statoil alliance, established more than two and a half years ago, expects to complete negotiations next year with authorities in Azerbaijan on terms and conditions to develop the Chirakh oil field, according to the chief executives of the respective companies, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Speaking in Stavanger at a briefing on the alliance's development, Mr David Simon of BP and Mr Harald Norvik of Statoil agreed that significant results had been achieved by the two companies in a very short time but recognised that its true test would be to bring production on stream with a resonable return on investment in the various areas where it was operating. Mr John Brown, BP vice-president of exploration and development, said the Chirakh development could need investment amounting to 'several tens of billions of kroner' but he would not be drawn on specific figures, which could be sensitive in current negotiations. The alliance believes the Chirakh field holds at least 1bn barrels of oil. The two companies aim to bring it on stream by the end of 1997 with output of about 200,000 barrels a day. In March, the alliance delivered results of a development study for Chirakh to Socar, the Azerbaijani state oil company, and also results of a study on the prospects of exploring for oil and gas in the Shak Deniz area, in the southern part of the Caspian Sea. Elsewhere in the South Caspian Sea, the BP/Statoil alliance is participating in a licence operated by Amoco, which has commenced negotiations on obtaining a production sharing agreement. Next month it aims to bring on stream non-productive wells in western Siberia that it has rehabilitated.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.     Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.     Statoil.

Turnover at Pounds 45.9m was 18 per cent lower. Earnings per share fell to 1.84p from 2.76p. The impact of a 21-day maintenance shutdown at the onshore Wytch Farm field and the decommissioning of the Angus offshore field was reflected in last year's average production figure, which slipped to about 12,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent (including natural gas) from 13,888 b/d last time. But Mr Charles Jamieson, chief executive, said current production had recovered to 1992 levels and was set to rise to 20,000 b/d within two years. Cash balances stood at Pounds 47.2m at year end, with debt of Dollars 120m. Gearing was 50 per cent. The removal by the government last year of petroleum revenue tax relief on exploration and appraisal drilling was reflected in an Pounds 8.8m one-off exceptional charge. The amount relates to deferred PRT in prior years. Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said that aside from the exceptional charge, the loss of tax relief on exploration expenditure had been 'offset to some extent by the lower PRT rate'. Analysts said the exceptional charge was the only surprise in the results, which were otherwise in line with expectations. Additional appraisal of finds enabled the company to boost its estimate of proven reserves by 15 per cent. Mr Jamieson said the low oil price environment had caused the company to focus on projects which could lead to an early payback. He said 75 per cent of the company's effort would be aimed at projects which could enhance short to medium term cash flow, with 25 per cent reserved for longer term exploration activity. COMMENT Cuba, Cambodia and Myanmar are just a few of the exotic though difficult locations which have appealed to Premier's explorers So far the strategy of going into difficult countries has worked well. Premier gets good terms and large stakes. If finds are made some of the stake is farmed out topay for development, leaving the company with a good chunk of the consequent production. But if oil prices linger at low levels it can only extend the strategy if the majors which operate many of its producing fields can continue to make significant cuts in their costs.

The 1-for-12 offer values each Tuskar share at I1.78p. Coplex shares closed in Australia on Friday at 45 cents. Tuskar's shares closed at I1.75p last night. The Tuskar board will consider whether to recommend the offer to shareholders, once it has been formally received. Tuskar's principal asset is its 90 per cent interest in the Rubiales oilfield in Colombia with estimated recoverable reserves of 100m barrels. Tuskar has completed three exploration wells to date, but lacks the financial resources to complete testing to declare the field commercial. Tuskar must drill two further wells to hold its licence beyond June 30 this year. In an interim statement last month Mr Neil O'Donoghue, Tuskar's chairman, said that commercial development of the field would require investment sufficient to produce oil at 25,000 barrels per day to offset high transport costs and the current low prices for the heavy crude which the field produces. He said: 'The required amount of funds cannot be raised at this time, and any attempt to do so would not even raise sufficient funds to complete the current work programme.'

The aim is to double the recovery rate in the Rhourde el Baguel oilfield in eastern Algeria from 20 to 40 per cent of recoverable reserves. Of the total investment, Dollars 1bn will be spent in exploration over the next five years; the balance is the so-called 'entrance right'. This is the first agreement of this type concluded since Algeria's oil and gas exploration laws were liberalised in a new hydrocarbons law of December 1989. A string of oil exploration contracts have been signed over the past two years which have led to pacts signed between Sonatrach and more than two dozen international oil companies. The Arco deal came in the face of increased nervousness among foreign governments about the safety of their nationals in Algeria. On Monday, gunmen disguised as Algerian police killed four Russians and a Romanian working with Sonatrach. Suspected Moslem fundamentalists last week killed seven Italian seamen, and four Algerians died yesterday in a shootout outside Italy's Algiers embassy. Mr Livio Caputo, Italian deputy foreign minister, said in Rome that Italy had said it would reduce the number of Italians in Algeria and would boost security for expatriate workers and its diplomatic missions.

The latest well, three kilometres south of BP's discovery, confirms that the Schiehallion reservoir extends into neighbouring exploration blocks. BP has estimated Schiehallion's recoverable oil reserves at 250m to 500m barrels. Amerada Hess, whose partners include Aran Energy, OMV and Murphy Petroleum, said it will hold talks with BP and its partner Shell on ways to 'appraise the technical and commercial potential of the field as quickly as possible'. Amerada Hess also announced that it had bought Esso's 15 per cent share in the nearby Clair field - a vast 3bn barrel reservoir which, with its complex geology and remote location, has so far defied development. The latest find at Schiehallion is expected to encourage other oil companies with acreage in the area to accelerate exploration programmes. Last week 10 companies said they were looking at the possibility of an integrated development scheme which might improve the economic viability of a number of projects west of Shetland. The deep water and bad weather in the area - and the absence of established infrastructure such as pipelines - makes development of the oil and gas resources relatively risky.

State Councillor Song Jian and other leaders from the  central  and local governments took part in the meeting, which was  sponsored by the Environmental Protection Committee of the State  Council.    Speaking at the meeting, Xie Zhenhua, director of the State  Bureau of Environmental Protection, said that total proven coal  reserves in the adjacent area of Shanxi-Shaanxi-Inner Mongolia  now reach over 280 billion tons.    He said that reasonable exploration of coal resources in the  area is of great significance to promoting the development of  the national economy.    But, he added, natural conditions in the area are poor due  to  an overemphasis on exploration, to the detriment of  environmental protection.    As a result, the environment was seriously polluted in this  area, with much coal wasted and a large portion of topsoil  washed away, he said.    He added that the central government has paid very close  attention to environmental protection in developing natural  resources in the area.    He urged taking forceful measures to reorder coal  exploration  and strengthen supervision over environmental protection work in  this area.    In the near future, he continued, the urgent task is to  clear  out rivers to ensure that flood peaks pass safely in the coming  year.    The participants also investigated the serious soil damage  in  the area due to natural resource exploration.     "

The well, which is operated by Anadarko of the US - Lasmo's partner in the venture along with Maersk of Denmark, was tested at a cumulative rate of 8,100 barrels of oil and condensate and 82.5m cu ft of gas a day. It is the third discovery from four exploration wells which Anadarko has drilled in the area. Two additional prospects in the area will be drilled soon, according to Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer. The desert areas being explored have so far been free from any of the political violence affecting Algeria. But drilling crews and technical staff are flown directly to the area, thus avoiding the capital, Algiers. Further drilling to appraise the full potential of the discoveries is likely to take place later this year, the company said. It is also assessing the overall potential of Algeria in light of the string of discoveries. Premier Consolidated Oilfields, an independent exploration and production company, has found gas in a new field to the west of the large Qadripur gas field in Pakistan. The discovery in the Ghauspur block was in geology similar to that of Qadripur. But the different composition of the gas confirmed it was a separate field, the company said. Gas from the latest find has a relatively low calorific value and a high nitrogen content, but the company believes it could be marketable if the reserve proves large enough.

The  scientists want monthly payments of $5,500 (3.63 million real  cruzeiros), which are equivalent to the salaries paid to  military personnel, and the CNPq is offering $1,700 (1.2 million  real cruzeiros).    The researchers refused to leave for Antarctica this week as  scheduled for a 10-month period at the station, and just eight  military officers supplying logistics support for the project  traveled. According to Heber Reis Passos, the Trade Union of  Federal Servants in the Science and Technology Area director,  the problem started when the Navy Ministry, responsible for the  entire project during its first eight years, disengaged itself  from the research field, which was taken over by the Science and  Technology Ministry last year.

He emphasized that  the CNPq has contacted researchers who already have been at the  station before to replace those who refused to leave for  Antarctica.

The agreement covers joint evaluation of oil and gas production opportunities of the vast region and close co-operation with Russian companies and research institutes. The two companies have separately studied this part of the Arctic during the past five years but have joined forces to co-ordinate resources in an effort to enhance their evaluations and working knowledge of the area, for which the Russians have announced their intention to issue exploration rights. A Norsk Hydro executive said that the two companies would also be looking at sites to identify a potential location for an oil export terminal. Amoco and Hydro last month joined Texaco and Exxon in establishing the Timan Pechora Company, which is negotiating a production sharing contract with Russia for an area onshore in the Timan Pechora Basin. In the Barents and Pechora Seas Hydro and Amoco will be seeking to identify areas where exploration could be undertaken. Five years ago Hydro provided technical assistance to the Russians during production testing of the giant Shtokmanovskoye field, believed to be one of the world's biggest gas fields, in the northern part of the Barents Sea. Hydro had hoped to be awarded a production sharing agreement for the field, which went instead to the Russian company Rosshelf. Hydro withdrew from the project in 1992.

Mr Ken Dredge, executive general manager of MIM Holdings (Lead and Zinc), yesterday said 26 per cent of Australia's land mass is closed to mineral exploration through either environmental or aboriginal claims. A further 22 per cent is under claims for further restriction. Access to large land tracts at minimal costs is essential for successful exploration. For every 1,000 initial explorations, roughly 100 warrant further detailed work and just 10 are drilled. 'Limiting access to land only increases these odds,' Mr Dredge said. Speaking at an annual conference of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Mr Dredge noted the uncertainties in the country's investment rules. He cited the ADollars 2bn (Pounds 830m) coal development project of Utah Development Company in Bowen Basin in the late 1960s. Shortly after the project started turning in handsome returns following energy price rises in the early 1970s, the Australian government introduced a special duty on open cut coal production and a regime of rail freights for subsequent export coal projects that incorporated additional royalties. Last year's federal government decision to refuse approval for gold and platinum mining at Coronation Hill also illustrated the present mineral investment environment. 'The uncertainty and confusion created by such decisions resulted in Australian miners spending increasing proportions of their exploration budget overseas,' Mr Dredge said.

However, the independent oil and gas exploration and production company still intends to pursue an expansive exploration policy. Profits were Pounds 3.04m for 1991, down from Pounds 9.98m last time, equivalent to earnings of 2p (2.9p) per share. The fall came despite a sharp increase in daily production, from the equivalent of 19,000 barrels of oil a day to 24,000 b/d. But the realised UK price amounted to Pounds 11.37 per barrel, compared to Pounds 13.42. The company's proven and probable reserves amounted to 195,774m barrels of oil equivalent, down from 197,289m. Dr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the company continued to seek new oil sources, mainly in regions outside its traditional North Sea area of operation. There had been particularly encouraging results from a well off the east coast of the Malaysian peninsula. It was still being tested but appeared to contain several reservoirs of high quality oil The group is maintaining its final dividend at 0.75p leaving the total for the year unchanged at 1.25p. It said, however, that there was inevitably a conflict between the need to fund exploration and the requirement to pay dividends.

0,FT941-14614 ,"FT941-14614 _AN-EASC7AFVFT 940119   FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taking the heat out of diamond fever - The Australian Stock Exchange's new code for reporting discoveries      By NIKKI TAIT   Diamonds, always a girl's best friend, have in recent months also become a stock market speculator's dream. So much so that the Australian Stock Exchange has quietly adopted a new reporting code for diamond exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves. This has been devised by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee - a standard-setting body formed in the nickel boom days of the early-1970s and backed by the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Australian Mining Industry Council, and the Australian Institute of Geoscientists. The code, says the committee, represents the first time anyone has attempted to standardise the way in which diamond discoveries should be reported and ensure that investors are given a reasonable idea of the commercial significance of exploration results. The problem is simple: diamonds, by their nature, are easy to find, but discovering a large-scale, economically-viable diamond resource is another matter entirely. 'To the best of my knowledge, it's also the first time such a standard has been adopted by a stock exchange,' adds Mr Ray Schoer, director of operations at the ASX. The Australian exchange, however, may not be out on a limb for long: the JORC reports inquiries and requests for copies of the code from both the US and Canada, where a diamond rush has been under way for a couple of years. Laudable though the initiative may be, it comes not a moment too soon. Two recent incidents in Australia have demonstrated all-too-clearly the volatility which can surround diamond-related stocks. The first was Great Central Mines, a Melbourne-based exploration business whose shares jumped from around the ADollars 7 to as much as Dollars 19 last spring, capitalising the loss-making company at a staggering ADollars 1bn-plus. That performance was influenced by a discovery of 'microdiamonds' in the Greater Nabberu region of Western Australia, which GCM's chairman and managing director, Mr Joseph Gutnick, described as 'significant' but was judged uneconomic by the company's joint venture partner, Stockdale Prospecting, a subsidiary of De Beers, the South African mining house. Today the twinkle has faded. GCM's shares are back in the ADollars 9.50-Dollars 10 range, despite some institutional support in the wake of a rather more substantial gold discovery. The second instance of runaway diamond shares occured only last month, and concerned Cambridge Gulf Exploration, a stockmarket newcomer. Cambridge shares, which had been issued at 25 cents in July, surged above ADollars 4 in mid-December on news that the company had found diamonds in the Bonaparte Gulf, off Western Australia. When Cambridge released the details of this discovery - stemming from a small sample of sea-bed gravel - the ASX demanded more information about the sampling methods, the location of the discovery, and so on. Today, the shares are trading at about ADollars 2.20. But, while GCM and Cambridge have grabbed the headlines, one JORC member says that the lack of guidelines on diamond-related reporting was a much more fundamental problem. 'GCM and Cambridge were just a manifestations of the fact that diamonds were becoming hot news. But a dozen other companies, perfectly straightforward, were also unsure how to present their results'. In essence, the new code aims to ensure that anyone reporting diamond exploration results gives investors some clues as to the commercial significance of the find. It carries a cautionary note, for example, stating that diamond valuations 'have only been considered reliable on parcels of at least 2,000 carats of diamonds from a single deposit'. 'Valuations placed on a small number of diamonds from exploration samples become meaningless and are likely to be misleading,' it continues. The code goes on to require details of the professional valuation experience of anyone reporting on a parcel of diamonds; to set out sampling information required; to insist that reports of indicator minerals be prepared 'by a suitably qualified person; and formally to define 'microdiamonds' as those being less than 0.4mm in size and weighing less than 0.001 carats. 'By definition, pre-resource mineralisation must be considered to be mineralisation of significance,' states the code. 'The occurence of individual diamonds or microdiamonds in surficial desposits or from inadequately-sized samples from a primary or secondary rock source would not usually qualify as pre-resource mineralisation'. In short, while the outback may glitter, that, in itself, does not mean anything of substance. For all practical purposes, says Mr Schoer, the new strictures come into effect immediately. Existing listing rules demand that the market be kept informed. So, citing this broad requirement, the ASX will require exploration companies to meet the best practice levels set down in the code. Analysts are generally grateful. 'I think it will be a great help to investors,' says Mr David Kauler at Pru-Bache, for example. 'I think it is fair to say that there is a problem in industry reporting, especially with the junior explorers. This will go a long way to improving the quality of the results.'

'No-one questions the technical possibilities of major finds here.' The country has more that 70m hectares of potentially oil-bearing territory but only 17 per cent of that is covered by existing exploration contracts. Since 1983, investment in oil exploration in Peru has been in almost continuous decline. Last year companies under contract with state-owned Petroperu invested a mere Dollars 43m in exploration, a tenth of the amount invested ten years earlier. Proven oil reserves have slumped to about 350m barrels, half of their 1982 level, and Petroperu estimates exploration investment should be at least Dollars 115m a year. But the situation, it is hoped, is about to change. The controversial return to democracy in Peru via congressional elections on 22 November could now pave the way for a long-awaited spurt of foreign investment. 'The April 5 coup didn't scare investors away,' says Mr Alderson, 'but it did slow things down. If Peru's democracy is now accepted as valid, we're away and flying. Peru has ten times the opportunities of Argentina, for example, and, historically it's no less stable or any worse a risk than either Argentina, Colombia or Bolivia.' For the past two years, SPT (formerly Robertson Research) has been working with Petroperu to boost foreign interest in Peruvian oil. Twice-yearly promotional tours have targeted oil operators, largely in the US, who are seeking fresh fields for expansion. A big factor in Peru's favour is recent legislation governing foreign investment in general and oil exploration in particular. 'The current law works,' says Mr Jaime Quijandria, president of Petroperu. 'We can prove we offer better conditions than Colombia, Argentina or Ecuador - and investors are coming.' One hiccup has been the delay in gaining final approval for contracts. But under new, streamlined procedures Petroperu has been able to reach speedy agreement with three US oil companies over exploration and development, but Peru's council of ministers has inexplicably been dragging its feet. One of these contracts is with Great Western Resources for exploration in the Peruvian jungle; another with Olympic of Denver, Colorado, in association with a Peruvian firm Petrolera San Juan for drilling in the northern coastal area of Piura; and the third, an exploration and production contract, with Texas-based Clayton Williams. The proposed joint venture with Clayton Williams, the ebullient Texan operator who once ran for governor of his home state, is Petroperu 's first  -and the first for an area already producing. Clayton Williams has an 80 per cent share and will bear the full Dollars 10m initial cost of drilling five wells. Petroperu's contribution will come in down the line when a further 40 wells are planned. Mr Quijandria is convinced that Peru must, as Colombia did, get its oil industry off the ground with a series of similar smallish contracts. 'The larger companies aren't risk-takers,' he says. 'They prefer the smaller fry to come in and do the donkey work - then they'll move in later.' There are only two big names operating locally at present, Mobil and Occidental Petroleum - and both have been in Peru for years. Occidental has increased its output by 20 per cent in the past few months since settlement of a long-running dispute with the previous Peruvian government. Mobil's hopes of striking it big in Peru's unexplored central jungle, meanwhile, have been dashed. The company boldly entered the central Huallaga, centre of the Peruvian illegal cocaine trade, two years ago. The camp was attacked by Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas in December 1990 and had to be almost completely rebuilt. Terrorism is not the reason for the pull-out, however. After investing about Dollars 32m in necessary infrastructure, the first well drilled was dry. 'At least we've learned there's no oil there at 9,000 ft down,' says a philosophical Mr Quijandria. 'But remember the Huallaga basin has never been drilled before - it would have been utopian to find oil first go.' Petroperu's promotional efforts focus on two Peruvian basins, the Ucayali and the Maranon. Both have basic transport infrastructure in place and are close to Peru's northern pipeline. Initial surveys show the jungle zone of Madre de Dios is also promising, but transport is more of a problem. The hurdle is getting the first investors interested. Petroperu is having to go it alone with development of the rich Chambira deposits, where oil was struck three years ago. Now that Dollars 30m in financing has been agreed with the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), Chambira should be producing 7,500 barrels a day within 12 months. 'This is a totally no-risk enterprise,' says Mr Quijandria. 'Yet we offered it for a year to the private sector and no-one was interested.' While the complex process of privatising Petroperu is taking time, senior company managers, perhaps surprisingly in a massive state-owned enterprise, are full of initiatives. In recent weeks, Petroperu has reached a 'maquila' (lease on idle capacity) agreement with trader Marc Rich to utilise 20,000 b/d of idle capacity at its La Pampilla refinery. Marc Rich will bring in Dollars 18m of crude every 45 days for refining. The refined products will be left for Petroperu to market locally, and the residual crude will be re-exported. Later, when domestic Peruvian prices are more internationally competitive, it is expected that Marc Rich will market in Peru under its own brand-name. Camisea, the vast gas and condensates field discovered by Royal Dutch Shell in the Peruvian jungle in the mid-1980s, remains the most exciting prospect. Shell is dragging its feet - but Peru's current, dramatic electricity shortage is injecting fresh urgency into the search for a solution. State-owned Electroperu is now contemplating construction of several gas-fired thermal plants near Camisea. Electricity could be shipped over the Andes by cable instead of building a gas pipe-line. 'It's a financing problem now,' says Mr Quijandria. 'I'm suggesting the government appoint an agent to get a consortium together for the Dollars 1.4bn needed to develop Camisea. Then we have to put pressure on Shell to say whether they'll agree to head it.'   Countries:-  PEZ  Peru, South America.   Industries:-  P1311  Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

0,FT942-7698 ,"FT942-7698 _AN-EEYBKAF6FT 940524   FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Billion-dollar changes for YPF - The oil group is undergoing a transformation      By JOHN BARHAM   YPF, Argentina's privatised oil company, is to transform its domestic operations and back a cautious expansion into neighbouring markets with a Dollars 100m a month investment programme. The expansion of exploration and production and the revamping of its retail business is the company's largest investment programme, and the most evident sign of YPF's transformation from a corrupt, money-losing state corporation to a profit-oriented, private company. Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF's president, says he now has 'one firm commitment: profits. Our investors have become the most important part of our corporate life'. He claims YPF's investment plans are proof that this is no cheap corporate hype. More than Dollars 1bn is budgeted for next year and a further Dollars 1bn in 1996. Argentina's biggest company is now 20 per cent owned by the federal government, with the rest held by the employees and provincial governments. The government, which once owned the company outright, sold 45 per cent last June in a Dollars 3.04bn local and international initial public offering. Last year, YPF raised profits 176 per cent to Dollars 706m, despite lower oil prices and an increase of just 2 per cent in sales to Dollars 3.96bn. However, profits and revenues both declined in the first quarter as oil prices continued falling. YPF is to sink 720 new production wells this year, at a cost of Dollars 700m. Mr Estenssoro wants to raise output by one-fifth to 450,000 barrels per day by the end of 1995, and then maintain production at this level. 'Argentina's wells are small producers, so (we need to do) a lot of drilling,' he says. Mr Estenssoro wants to maintain YPF's oil reserves at the equivalent of 10 years' production through a big exploration effort. This year YPF is spending Dollars 300m to drill 180 exploration wells as part of a Dollars 3bn, 10-year exploration programme. Argentina is self-sufficient in oil, although it does not come close the volumes of Mexico or Venezuela, Latin America's big oil producers. But it does have considerable potential: Mr Estenssoro says only five of its 19 identified oil-bearing basins have been explored and are in production. The country does have much more natural gas than oil. YPF and joint-venture partners Ampolex of Australia and Petrobras of Brazil are investing Dollars 250m over four years to explore a potentially giant gas field in north western Argentina. Mr Estenssoro is spending a further Dollars 250m this year to upgrade YPF's downstream business, where profitability is low. In August 1990, when he took over at YPF, the downstream business lost Dollars 400m. It is now returning 5 per cent on assets, and Mr Estenssoro wants to double profitability by next year. In comparison, the upstream production business returns about 20 per cent a year. YPF has also started a Dollars 500m, five-year project to bring its operations - particularly its refineries - into line with world environmental standards. Finally, YPF is spending Dollars 300m between 1993-96 to renovate its retail network. The company has 2,800 petrol stations, many more than its competitors, but its stations are a byword for bad service. YPF is financing the investment programme with a mix of bank borrowing, retained earnings and overseas bond sales. Mr Estenssoro announced earlier this year a Dollars 350m Yankee bond issue and a Dollars 500m medium-term note issue. Analysts praise the company for reducing production and administrative costs to compensate for falling oil prices. Some, however, criticise Mr Estenssoro for not hedging oil prices and thus exposing YPF's growing exports to dwindling prices. Mr Estenssoro has continued cutting the work force - which stood at 51,000 when he took over and now numbers only 6,500 - leading to growing criticism from the unions. However, many former employees still work for the company as subcontractors, often on excessively generous terms, say some analysts. Competitors and economists also complain that YPF abuses its dominant market position. It produces over half Argentina's oil, has over half its refinery capacity and controls half the retail market. Mr Estenssoro rejects accusations that YPF plays dirty. 'The market works, it is very competitive and if YPF did not exist, or was not as big as it is, its market would be split among the multinationals,' he says. YPF, which has always focused on its domestic market, is gradually expanding into neighbouring countries. It has just opened a 270-mile pipeline over the Andes to Chile, allowing it to raise exports by Dollars 300m a year. Mr Estenssoro says: 'We are looking to our neighbours as a natural place to expand.' He has started small exploration projects in Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay and is negotiating exploration contracts in Chile and Peru. YPF may bid for the Peruvian and Bolivian state oil companies when they are offered for privatisation. It seems appropriate that YPF, the world's first state oil company and Latin America's first privatised oil company, should make a stab at becoming the region's first private oil multinational.

The deal, covering rights to 10,000 sq km, arises from a contract signed in 1989 for Amoco to do a survey based on what was known of Poland's domestic energy resources. It comes in the midst of tendering by other foreign companies for oil exploration rights to a further 35,000 sq km of the country. A tender has also just closed for coal bed methane gas exploration; six foreign companies, including Amoco, applied. Poland is dependent on supplies of Russian gas for two-thirds of its 13bn cubic metres annual consumption, while almost all its oil is imported from Russia and the Middle East. Natural gas reserves are now put at 170bn cu m, while as yet undocumented resources are estimated at 630bn cu m The World Bank has granted the state a Dollars 250m loan for the development of the gas industry while the European Investment Bank has provided Dollars 60m. Russia's top corruption fighter yesterday accused crooked western businessmen of siphoning off three-quarters of the profits due to his country from its dwindling sales of oil abroad, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Mikhail Gurtovoy, who heads a government anti-corruption team, said Russia, pushed by its need for foreign investment in the energy sector, had let in a 'swarm of petty crooks' from abroad when it allowed foreign and Russian companies to set up oil-producing joint ventures.

Oceanographers on a three-month expedition to the Greenland  Sea have found a significant reduction in ""deep convection"" --  the process by which the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is  transported to the sea bed.    Dr. Peter Wadhams of the Scott Polar Research Institute,  leader of the expedition, said yesterday the decline was  ""disturbing and surprising.""    ""Convection in the Greenland Sea has virtually stopped in  the  last decade,"" he told Oceanology International, a marine science  conference in Brighton.    ""It is a process that has been going on for several thousand  years and when you see it decline sharply over a decade it gets  you worried.""    The process was ""a plughole"" for carbon dioxide and its  decline could leave more of the gas in the atmosphere,  increasing global warming through the greenhouse effect, he said.    It occurs in only four places -- the Greenland Sea, the  Labrador Sea, the Weddell Sea in Antarctica and in the western  Mediterranean.    Dense surface water sinks to the sea bed, taking carbon  dioxide with it.    Except in the Mediterranean, the process begins when ice  sheets expand in the winter. As ice forms, salt is rejected  into the water, making it more dense and forcing it deeper.    On last year's expedition, oceanographers studied the  process  at the Odden Ice Tongue -- an unusual ice sheet about 100 miles  long and 50 miles wide in the Greenland Sea.    ""Convection there is dependent on ice forming,"" said Dr.  Wadhams. ""But in recent years not enough ice has been forming.""  This itself could be a result of global warming, he added.    Measurements of salinity and temperature taken from the  expedition's four research ships showed that convection took  place to a depth of only 3,000 feet last year, compared with  6,000 feet five years ago.    Ten years ago convection took place all the way down to the  sea bed -- 12,000 feet.     "

The subsidiary, Esso China Ltd., will begin to gather  seismic  data in a contract sea block on June 26.    Esso and 14 big foreign oil companies, including Texaco,  Chevron, Shell and Phillips-Arco, are now searching for oil and  gas over a 64,246 square kilometer continental basin area in the  sea.    In May 1992, the Chinese Government decided to open part of  the offshore area in the East China Sea to foreign oil companies.    On June 30, 1992, the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation  opened bids for Sino-foreign joint development of oil in that  area.    Esso and 14 foreign oil companies beat fierce competition to  win bids to search for and produce oil and gas in 18 blocks in  the sea, in cooperation with the Chinese corporation.    Li May Phipps and Kevin Biddle, both vice-presidents of Esso  China Ltd., said that they were delighted at Esso's success in  winning a contract block.    The 2,120 sq km block is about 200 km north-east of Wenzhou,  a port in Zhejiang Province.    Biddle said: ""We are fully confident of our success in  exploring oil in the East China Sea.""    Since oil exploration in the East China Sea began in the  early 1970s, an oilfield and nine oil-bearing structures have  been discovered and 27 oil exploratory wells drilled there.    After seismic exploration is completed and relevant data  processed, Esso China Ltd. will choose the best well location to  drill an exploratory well, he said.    Drilling is expected to begin next year, he added.    Founded in 1882, Esso is currently searching for oil and gas  in more than 80 countries. It spent 8.2 billion U.S. dollars in  investment and exploration in 1993.    Esso opened a representative office in Beijing 13 years ago  as part of its effort to participate in developing energy  resources in China.    Biddle said that over the past ten years and more, his  parent  company had spent 200 million U.S. dollars in the search for  offshore oil and gas resources in China.    To date, Esso has drilled 17 wells in two blocks in the  South  China Sea, striking both oil and gas there, he said.    Moreover, together with Chinese partners, Esso is also  searching for oil in the Tarim basin in northwest China's  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, he added.    He said he thought that oil and gas resources in northwest  China are probably even more promising than those in the Daqing  oilfield in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and in the  Shengli oilfield in east China's Shandong Province.    Esso's cooperation with China is based on long-term  interests, he said, adding that Esso will try to expand its  cooperation with Chinese partners in accordance with the  principles of equality and mutual benefit.    Esso is also willing to invest in energy projects in China,  such as oil projects, coal projects and power projects, he added.     "

Both groups confirmed yesterday that they had restarted talks, shelved since the imposition of the United Nations embargo at the start of the Gulf war, on the exploitation of two large oil and gas reserves north of Bassorah near the Iranian frontier. Iraq, in desparate need of foreign exchange to tackle shortages of basic supplies and to rebuild the economy, approached them to study crude oil buying contracts in preparation for the possible ending of the trade embargo. It then extended the talks to cover exploration and production sharing. Other western oil groups have also been approached, said Elf and Total. Both French oil groups emphasised the talks were at an early stage, that they had not signed commitments and would not sign anything until Iraq had obeyed its obligations to the UN and the embargo had been lifted. However, the Iraqi vice president, Mr Taha Yassine Ramadan, yesterday said oil production would restart soon, and would not necessarily await a UN security council decision. 'Certain countries realise that it is in their interests to re-establish relations with Iraq,' he told a Jordanian newspaper. Elf said: 'We are simply preparing for the moment when Iraq will become integrated into the international community. We have signed nothing and will sign nothing until Iraq is part of the international community.' Total warned against expecting an early agreement.

And Arco's Yacheng 13-1 operation, the largest offshore  gasfield in China, is scheduled to go onstream in January 1996,  the company announced.    Arco experts have spent the last few months surveying  Chinese  onshore oil and gas fields in Daqing, Liaohe, Dagang, Sichuan  and Shengli.    ""We are looking at many opportunities for onshore oil  operations,"" said John Knepler, vice-president of the  Shekon-based Arco China Incorporate.    ""But we have to decide which ones we believe are economic to  pursue,"" he said.    The Yacheng field will supply natural gas through pipelines  to Hong Kong and Hainan Island. The gas will feed electric power  plants and a fertilizer factory.    ""By the year 2002 the Yacheng Gasfield will be producing 9.3  million cubic metres each day, and we will have recovered our  investment,"" the 48-year-old vice-president said.    The gasfield, with reserves of 100 billion cubic metres, was  discovered by Arco, with the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation and the Santa Fe Energy Corporation in 1983.    At present, Arco is focusing its efforts on getting partners  for oil and gas exploration and development in China.    The average worldwide exploration success rate for 1987 to  1992 was only 6 percent.    ""We know that exploration work is very risky and that is why  the successes must pay for the failures or we would go out of  business,"" said Knepler.    Arco is bullish on the prospects of finding large quantities  of oil and gas both onshore and offshore, he said.    Arco, which came to China in 1979, is regarded as one of the  lucky foreign oil firms which have so far operated successfully  in China.

These figures, released by Wang Tao, president of the China  National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), at a national oil work  conference here today, are both higher than the government-set  output targets.    This is an effort to match the development of the oil  industry to the demand of the country's rapid economic growth,  Wang told the conference.    He described the situation of the oil industry as ""good"",  although it falls short of demand and has become one of the  bottlenecks of the national economy.    China produced 139 million tons of crude and 15.9 billion  cubic meters of natural gas, thanks to strengthened exploration  and development of oil fields. However, the ever-expanding  demand has pushed China onto the verge of becoming a ""net oil  importer.""    Wang called for intensive exploration for additional  resources to prepare China for the next century. China expects  to extract 200 million tons of oil and gas in oil equivalent by  the year 2000, according to an ambitious plan.    To this end, China has embarked on a strategy of stabilizing  the production in the eastern part of China and developing  reserves in the western part.    The eastern part of China, which includes such important oil  fields as Daqing, Shengli and Liaohe, is China's main oil  producer.    CNPC will invest billions of yuan in a bid to maintain the  production level in the eastern part of the country. New  technology and management will be adopted in the Daqing oilfield  in order to keep its annual oil output well above 55 million  tons up to the turn of the century.    The western part of China, especially the Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region, is regarded as a key alternative. Its crude  output for the first time topped 10 million tons for the first  time [as received] in 1993.    This year the figure is expected to rise to 11.9 million  tons, Wang said. Exploration will be carried out both  intensively and extensively, he added.    CNPC is striving to strike a balance between oil output and  new recoverable reserves and between capital input and output,  according to Wang. As the government eases off restrictions on  oil prices, the industry has wiped out red inks. However, Wang  warned against high cost and low efficiency in oil production.    Wang welcomed the participation in oil exploration and  development by other sectors, enterprises, localities, people  from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, overseas Chinese and foreign  investors.    CNPC has announced the second round of international bidding  for risk exploration in 26 blocks and 11 projects to enhance oil  recovery in the existing oilfields.    Preparatory work for the third round bidding is to start  soon  and more blocks in southwestern and western China are expected  to open to foreign bidders.    Wang admitted that China's oil will not be able to meet the  demand by the year 2000. He said crude import will depend on  economic growth but China still needs to sell some oil abroad  for foreign currency, technology and equipment.     "

0,FT931-1667 ,"FT931-1667 _AN-DCXCKADOFT 930324   FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China plans drive to woo foreign mining investors      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   CHINA WILL soon embark on a drive to attract much-needed foreign involvement in its flagging minerals development sector, following a comprehensive review of its resources policy. Mr Zeng Shaojin, director of exploration for the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, said in an interview that China was accelerating attempts to involve foreign companies in both the exploration and development of its minerals under what he described as its Prospecting Treasure Plan. This aimed at providing China with the additional mineral resources needed to support its booming economy, which is expected to grow at between 8 and 9 per cent annually for the rest of this decade. It registered growth last year of 12.8 per cent. Mr Zeng said China planned to invite foreign miners to Beijing in May to discuss about 30 projects that might be available. United Nations bodies would help to organise the conference. The Chinese official admitted that the response of foreign mining companies to earlier overtures by China had been disappointing. He hoped that new regulations to be released later this year would be more appealing. In Beijing, the representative of a foreign mining conglomerate described existing mining regulations - these date from 1986 - as 'strongly nationalistic' and a disincentive to investment. What was needed, he said, was both a change in the regulations to link development with exploration under favourable terms and, perhaps more importantly, a shift in philosophy. Mr Zeng seemed to indicate the latter was possible when he declared that China was now anxious to secure foreign assistance because it had neither the funds nor the advanced minerals treatment technology required. China's mineral resources were rich and diversified, he declared, but were under-developed. Per capita yield of minerals is only half the world's average. The Chinese official indicated that priority minerals included copper (China imports about half its requirements of copper concentrate, an intermediate material), lead, zinc, iron ore, coal, diamonds, rare earths, uranium and possibly gold. While Chinese regulations effectively prevent foreign exploitation of gold reserves at present, Mr Zeng indicated that this might change if 'certain gold deposits need high technology and funds for development.' He conceded that China had in the past two decades devoted too big a proportion of its minerals exploration and development budget to the search for gold. This had absorbed about 60 per cent of all funds devoted to solid minerals exploration. He estimated China's 'in-ground' gold reserves at 3,000 tonnes, and these were being added to at the rate of about 10 per cent annually. China mined about 100 tonnes of gold a year. In anticipation, possibly, of a more encouraging environment for foreign mining companies in China there appears to have been a revival of interest. Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia recently signed an agreement to investigate a lead-zinc deposit in Sichuan province. But foreign mining representatives indicated that they would proceed cautiously until they could be sure China had indeed experienced a change of heart and was genuinely open for business in the sensitive minerals area.

The minerals are iron ore, manganese, chrome, sulphur, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel and the platinum group. Under the new order, Indian public and private sector mining companies will be allowed 50 per cent foreign equity participation on an automatic basis. But the government will be ready to sanction higher foreign capital participation depending on the merits of each case. However, mineral and metal processing units with any level of foreign equity will now be allowed to develop captive mines (mines tied to metal processors). While the new national mineral policy is part of India's economic reform programme, it is also a response to the need to introduce foreign technology and funds to develop 'world grade mines to produce minerals at internationally competitive rates'. India has had success in recent years in discovering new mineral deposits through modern exploration techniques, but the public sector, in many cases, could not mobilise resources to develop mines. For example, Hindustan Copper, India's only copper producer, was forced to postpone the development of Malanjkhand underground copper ore mine with estimated reserve of 275m tonnes because of lack of finance. Things may now look up for Hindustan Copper and other public sector undertakings. According to Mr Balram Singh Yadav, minister of state for mines, the government has received a good number of enquiries for mineral exploration from leading mining companies in the US, Australia, South Africa and Canada. The government is hoping that joint ventures with foreign companies as partners will focus on the exploitation of those minerals in which the country is deficient or does not have exportable surpluses. An objective of the new policy is to promote the export of Indian minerals with as much value added as possible.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P10   Metal Mining.

Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the 15th round of offshore licensing would include all available unlicensed acreage in the southern basin and the central North Sea, where gas is predominant. The round would be 'fast track' to encourage rapid exploration. Applications should be in by July 26, and awards will be made in the autumn. Mr Eggar is also seeking nominations for blocks companies would like to see offered in the 16th round, which will cover coastal areas of Britain and the north of Scotland, including west of Shetland where BP has made a promising discovery. When blocks are in sensitive areas, the government will ask applicants to say how they would address environmental concerns. Later this year Mr Eggar will also give details of the 17th round which will include frontier areas such as Rockall. Mr Eggar said he did not expect any territorial controversies over these regions. The new rounds came with the release of figures showing that UK oil and gas reserves are at record levels with production heading for new highs. The government's Brown Book says recoverable reserves continue to rise at a faster rate than consumption. Oil production last year rose 6 per cent to 2.13m barrels a day. Gas output was up 17 per cent to 2.31 trillion cu ft. The book also shows that the number of exploration wells fell by 30 per cent last year. Mr Eggar said this was more likely to have been caused by the softness of the oil price than the government's decision to increase North Sea oil taxation. The Energy Report Vol 2.

0,FT932-15911 ,"FT932-15911 _AN-DDHB2ADVFT 930408   FT  08 APR 93 / Oil explorers warn of tax threat      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   NORTH SEA oil operators are preparing to warn the government that they will scale down oil exploration severely if changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax proposed in the Budget become law. The UK Offshore Operators' Association, the oil industry group, has drafted a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, saying that many companies will be unable to meet previous commitments made to the government over future drilling activity because of the planned PRT changes. A survey published yesterday by Ernst and Young, the accountants, found that 85 per cent of oil companies expect job losses to result from the PRT changes. Some 40 per cent of the respondents expected job losses to be much higher than the Treasury's estimate of 10,000. The changes to the PRT regime would reduce the tax rate for existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it for new fields. The chancellor also proposed to abolish tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. This means that companies will have to pay 64p for every pound spent on drilling activity, compared with 17p now. Companies say they applied for previous licences to explore for oil in the North Sea on the basis that the rules would stay the same. As part of those applications, they committed themselves to drilling a certain number of wells. If no tax relief is available for exploration, many companies will be unable to fulfil their obligations, the industry argues. But its response to the new rules is complicated by a row between winners and losers from the changes. Amerada Hess has said it will halve its exploration activity, but British Petroleum said the changes would improve recovery of oil from existing fields. Last year 116 wells were drilled and some estimates expect this to drop to just 80 this year as a result of the depressed oil price and the PRT changes.

This information has been  confirmed.    According to the information, drilling was conducted as deep  as 3,240 meters, and petroleum with better quality than that  found at the Varadero resort site was discovered at a depth of  approximately 2,500 meters.    The exploration activity is being carried out under the  terms  of a risk contract with the state Cuba Petroleum (Cupet) firm,  which controls oil-related business in the country and maintains  risk contracts with several foreign firms.    The information released by the Canadian firms and confirmed  by sources in Cuba's oil sector also notes that the well drilled  could produce about 3,750 barrels of oil a day. Drilling has  been stopped, however, to allow nearby areas to be surveyed to  evaluate the magnitude of the deposit.    According to specialists, the crude oil found is superior in  quality to the oil found in Varadero, which averages between 10  and 11 degrees API and has a high sulphur content. The oil  discovered in the Cardenas area has less sulphur and, therefore,  it will be less difficult to refine.    Petroleum exploration in Cuba is divided into 33 sectors, 11  of which were offered in bids in Calgary, Canada, and London in  February 1993.    Since 1990, Cuba has set up risk contracts with the French  Total firm and the European Petroleum firm to explore and  exploit crude oil in the island's territorial waters.    Foreign firms exploring for oil in the country are operating  under risk contracts that grant a maximum term of 25 years (four  of them corresponding to the exploration phase) and guarantee  that the firms will be able to freely utilize their agreed upon  quota of crude oil.    In this sense, Juan Fleites Melo, director of the Cuban  marketing firm Cupet, S.A., recently stated that foreign  companies will be able to sell part of the petroleum in the  country at international market prices if they so decide. Also,  no export taxes are being considered for those who decide to  sell the product overseas.    According to the provisions of this kind of contract, the  foreign sector supplies all of the capital investment and  technical means for oil exploration in an established area and  agrees to leave without any compensation if no oil is discovered.    According to experts from the Cuban Basic Industry Ministry,  seismic studies show very interesting results, particularly in  the sector located south of Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus  as well as in the marine areas where the Swedish firm Taurus  operates.    Structures known as reef-like formations in oil geological  terms have been found in this area. These structures are  considered very favorable for petroleum deposits.    Information available in the foreign companies' zone of  operation not only reveals the possibility of finding heavy  crude (90 percent of the total extracted in the country at  present), but also light crude.    Last year, domestic oil production reached 1.2 million tons.  Oil production for this year is estimated at 1.3 million tons.  This oil is used in the generation of electricity and the  production of nickel and glass, as well as in other sectors.     "

Officials of the Australia-Indonesia Joint Authority for the Timor Gap Zone of Co-operation say over 26,000 km (16,000 miles) of seismic work has been completed since 11 contract areas were designated between December 1991 and last February. The contracts commited companies to six-year exploration programmes worth Dollars 362m, under which they must complete 52,100 km of seismic work and drill 45 exploration wells. The Timor Gap is an offshore area of about 60,000 sq km between Indonesia and Australia. A dispute between the two countries over rights to the area was resolved by a treaty of co-operation, which came into effect in February 1991. The first well is to be drilled by the Australian subsidiary of Marathon Oil, a US-based company. A Marathon official said on Tuesday that a tender for a drilling vessel would be placed soon and a further four wells were scheduled for next year. Marathon is leading a consortium of Santos and Korea Petroleum in two contract areas and is commited to a Dollars 76m programme to drill 12 wells and conduct 10,000 km of seismic work. Other companies holding a stake in the contract areas include Shell, BP, Phillips and Enterprise Oil. The acreage agreements provide for production to be shared equally between the Joint Authority and the contractor, after recovery costs, up to the first 50,000 barrels. The governments of Indonesia and Australia are equal partners in the joint authority. Industry officials say the Timor Gap is a largely unknown territory for oil exploration. Only one well has previously been drilled in the area, 14 years ago, which found some gas and indicated the presence of hydrocarbons but not in commercial quantities.

Revenues for the quarter were down marginally at Dollars 9.7bn, against Dollars 9.75bn. For the whole of 1992 Texaco's net profit slumped by 45 per cent to Dollars 712m (Dollars 2.37 per share). This figure, however, included a Dollars 300m charge for changes in accounting principles. Revenues for 1992 were Dollars 37.7bn, down from Dollars 38.3bn in 1991. Mr James Kinnear, outgoing Texaco chief executive, said that beyond special charges, the decline in 1992 profits occurred primarily from soft market conditions for refined products, crude oil market conditions and a generally difficult business environment. But he added that in 1992 Texaco realised cash savings of about Dollars 500m from reductions in operating and overhead expenses. Texaco said its fourth-quarter operating income before taking the charges was Dollars 416m, up from Dollars 295m in the last quarter of 1991. Despite tax benefits of Dollars 40m, the fourth-quarter net profit was depressed by special charges. These included a special write-off of Dollars 34m caused by property damage from a fire at Los Angeles refinery and Hurricane Andrew. In addition, there were Dollars 58m of payments for staff severance payments and Dollars 64m for charges associated with asset-writedowns and reserves for environmental clean-up matters. Operating earnings from US petroleum and natural gas exploration and production in 1992 were Dollars 543m, down from Dollars 605m. Non-US exploration and production operating profits were Dollars 416m in 1992, against Dollars 421m in 1991. Manufacturing and marketing operating income in the US was Dollars 276m in 1992, against Dollars 188m in 1991, and Dollars 300m outside the US, down from Dollars 647m in 1991.

The goal is to find more reserves and maintain oil  production  in this part of the country at 124 million tons, according to a  senior official of the China National Petroleum Corporation  (CNPC).    The eastern region covers the vast area east of the Taihang  Mountains and the Three Gorges and north of the Chang Jiang  River. Oil reserves in this area are estimated at 33.5 billion  tons, 54 percent of China's total onshore oil reserves. It  produces 90 percent of the country's oil, which is expected to  reach 140 million tons this year, slightly higher than last.    After more than four decades of exploitation and  development,  most of the production wells have entered the period of decline.  The high content of water makes production difficult. The  amount of reserves verified is less than the amount of oil  tapped.    Oil production in this region is essential to maintain the  current level of production, as oil exploration and development  in the western part of the country has just begun and  transportation problems have hampered development.    According to the CNPC official, a plan has been in place to  increase the recovery rate of the old wells by five percentage  points by drilling more wells and adopting such technologies as  water control and tertiary extraction.    At the same time, efforts will be made to implement rolling  exploration and development in and around the old oil fields in  a bid to find more geological reserves. This will help find 100  million tons of new geological reserves a year and boost the  production capacity by two million tons.    In addition, the region will accelerate the development of  low-filtration, thick oil and shallow sea oil fields.    China's crude oil consumption increases at an annual rate of  six million to seven million tons.     "

0,FT922-70 ,"FT922-70 _AN-CF3ATAEHFT 920630   FT  30 JUN 92 / Double blow to whaling moratorium      By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent   ATTEMPTS to extend the moratorium on commercial whaling suffered a double blow yesterday when Norway announced that it would resume whaling next year and Iceland left the International Whaling Commission. Norway's decision to resume killing the minke whale - the smallest of the great whale species - was announced by Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, in Oslo, as the IWC was holding its annual meeting in Glasgow. The move was immediately criticised by Mr John Gummer, the British agriculture secretary, as well as by environmentalists and conference delegates. According to some delegates, Russia has also signalled that it might want to resume whale hunting. They said Russia, which ceased commercial whaling in the 1980s, had asked the IWC for a 'scientific allocation' of whales which it would be allowed to hunt for research. Commercial whaling was outlawed in 1986 by the IWC, but a legal loophole enables Japan and others to hunt for 'scientific research'. Over the past few years the IWC, to which 37 countries belong, has developed a system for managing and monitoring a resumed commercial whaling programme, known as the revised management procedure (RPM). The whaling nations hope that this week's conference will adopt the RPM, and thus sanction the hunting of minke whales whose stocks are considered to have recovered in the Antarctic and north-east Altantic. But Norway, which adhered to the moratorium in 1987 after threats by the US to ban imports of Norwegian fish, said that if the IWC did not adopt the RPM it would devise its own quota for minke whales for 1993. That would be consistent with proposals of the IWC scientific committee which assesses the minke whale population in the north-east Atlantic at 86,700 animals. In his address, Mr Gummer said the world would not 'allow us to risk a return to the barbarity of the past. Whales are an international - not a national - resource. A million or more have been killed this century in Antarctica alone. In a bloody and systematic way, nearly all of the great whale stocks have been hunted down to depleted, or even seriously endangered levels.' He added: 'No country that is party to international agreements can act unilaterally.' Conservation groups and countries opposed to whaling fear Norway's decision will be followed by Japan and Iceland.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

But Mr Alfred McCrane, chairman, warned: 'The international petroleum industry is faced with continuing uncertain world economic conditions, as well as the oversupply of crude oil,' which has pushed oil prices down by Dollars 3 a barrel since May. He added that attention to controlling costs and other operational improvements 'will be particularly important in the forward period'. Post-tax profits reached Dollars 309m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, compared with Dollars 151m, or 49 cents, a year ago. First-half net income was up from Dollars 383m (before the effect of a Dollars 300m charge reflecting an accounting change) to Dollars 587m. second-quarter operating profits of Dollars 419m, up from Dollars 294m, were bolstered by Dollars 163m from oil and gas exploration and production in the US, up from Dollars 112m on the back of natural gas prices which recovered from low 1992 levels. Upstream activities abroad returned an operating profit of Dollars 82m, against Dollars 46m, after benefiting from higher production in the Middle East and Indonesia. Refining and marketing operating profits fell from Dollars 77m to Dollars 63m in the US, reflecting 'excess supplies of refined products' on the US east and Gulf coasts. The international downstream operating result, aided by stronger margins in Latin America, rose from Dollars 61m to Dollars 120m. Petrochemicals suffered an operating loss of Dollars 7m (a Dollars 2m profit a year ago) due to higher feedstock and energy costs. Lower interest costs and cost-cutting reduced non-operating expenses by Dollars 53m to Dollars 210m. Higher natural gas prices also boosted Occidental Petroleum, pushing second-quarter net income to Dollars 75m, or 21 cents a share, up from Dollars 50m, or 16 cents, in the same period of 1992. Net income for the half year was Dollars 155m, against a loss of Dollars 87m last time when the company took a Dollars 93m charge for an accounting change. Second-quarter operating profits from oil and gas of Dollars 130m, up from Dollars 79m, were boosted by Dollars 55m from a tax refund and disposal of a stake in Trident NGL. In 1992, figures had been lifted by Dollars 35m from a litigation settlement. Amoco, the US oil and gas group, exceeded analysts' expectations with second-quarter net income of Dollars 487m, or 98 cents a share, compared with Dollars 216m, or 43 cents, before restructuring charges a year ago. The figures were boosted by higher earnings from US exploration and production, due mainly to higher gas prices, and an improvement in costs in refining and marketing, said Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman. Due to higher gas prices, operating profits from US exploration and production rose to Dollars 293m before a Dollars 63m charge for environmental clean-up costs, from Dollars 154m in the 1992 quarter. Lower exploration costs and favourable exchange movements pushed operating profits on foreign upstream activities to Dollars 53m, compared with a loss of Dollars 27m a year ago. First-half operating income was Dollars 830m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, compared with Dollars 473m, or 95 cents, a year ago, before the effects in 1992 of charges related to restructuring and accounting changes.

It is the latest of several legal setbacks for WMC. WMC, via a subsidiary, bought Seabright in 1987 for around CDollars 92m (USDollars 70m), as part of push into North America. However, within weeks of completing the acquisition, WMC described Seabright's Beaver Dam deposit, thought to be one of its most promising assets, as hopeless. By 1989, the Australian company had halted Seabright's operations and written off its investment. WMC proceeded to sue Seabright's president, Mr Terence Coughlan, and other directors, for alleged fraud and negligence. They counter-sued WMC, levelling a variety of charges, including abuse of process. Last year, Mr Justice Merlin Nunn, in the Nova Scotia Trial Division, delivered a judgment which was scathing of WMC's behaviour. He duly ordered the it to pay damages and costs, expected to exceed CDollars 10m, to the president and six former directors of Seabright. Yesterday, in the wake of the appeal court's decision, WMC said it still believed that its case had merit, and was 'considering an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada'. The Seabright affair has been only one of several costly legal debacles for WMC, one of Australia's largest mining companies, in recent months. It was forced to hand over the valuable Ernest Henry copper/gold deposit to Savage Resources in an out-of-court settlement after WMC's exploration team trespassed on a lease area, and then failed to advise Savage of its work. And, last November, WMC and Ord Minnett paid ADollars 20m to settle a case in which it was alleged that a report by the Australian stockbroker - stating that WMC's sale of a 50 per cent interest in the Lady Bountiful gold mine was 'fair and reasonable' - was negligent. The payment, to a small exploration company called Consolidated Exploration, which had sold the stake to WMC, was split between the two firms.   Companies:-  Western Mining Corp Holdings.

Inaugurating a three-day international round table  conference  on foreign investment in exploration and mining in India, Mr  Mukherjee said the Government had taken major steps to encourage  direct foreign investment in the newly opened minerals sector  after the amendment of the Mines and Minerals (Regulations and  Development) Act.    Fifteen major minerals and 21 minor minerals are now open  for  investments in mining and exploration by foreign investors with  equity participation upto 51 per cent, he said.    The Commerce Minister maintained that to encourage direct  foreign investment the Government has brought about major  changes in fiscal, industrial, trade and import-export policies,  and opening up of the mining sector is only a part of the  ongoing process.    Mr Mukherjee assured the foreign participants, representing  the world's largest mining companies from about 10 nations, that  present national policies were based on consensus and did not  depend on changes in the political leadership. ""India's  democracy is transparent, agile and vibrant supported by a  vigilant press and independent judiciary"", he added.    He reminded the prospective foreign investors that way back  when Indian banks were nationalised, foreign banks were not  touched at that time. India has never failed in its debt  repayment upto now and situation has become much better with  regard to foreign exchange reserves, he added.    The Minister said the Indian economy is the world's seventh  largest with the third largest pool of technical manpower and  professional managers. India has a large network of railways  and seaports and other infrastructure facilities - like the  powerful stock exchange system with 25 stock markets and 6,250  registered companies, which are available for collaboration.    He said already seven power projects are being set up in the  country by foreign investors. Nearly 34 industrial sectors are  open for foreign investment and collaboration.    Welcoming the delegates, Minister of State for Mines Balram  Singh Yadav said the objective of the three-day conference is to  familiarise investors with the mining potential offered by India  and to present a forum for interaction between investors and the  Central Government, the State Governments, the public and  private sector units, Geological Survey of India, Indian Bureau  of Mines and other agencies concerned with the minerals sector.    The Minister said potential areas for mining ventures are  where exploration activities during the last four decades have  resulted in identification of large resources, specially of iron  ore, bauxite, chromite and manganese, as also several medium and  small deposits of other mineral commodities. These resources  have not yet been mined to their fullest extent largely for want  of capital and appropriate technology and provide a ready  opportunity for profitable investment in the mining sector, he  added.    He maintained that over 94 per cent of India's area has  already been mapped by the Geological Survey of India so that  preliminary data is available for further development.  Technical consultancy and geological services are also provided  in the area of mining and preparation of geological plans by the  Indian Bureau of Mines on a commercial basis.    Speaking on the occasion, Mr I. G. Thingran, Secretary,  Ministry of Mines, said in the new deregulated environment which  is investment friendly foreign investors would find great scope  for investment in exploration and mining in India.    Many countries like China, France and Australia are already  cooperating with India in the mining sector, he said.     "

Mr Chris Gibson-Smith, BP's head of European exploration, said in his letter: 'It is in the national interest that these reforms are implemented without delay.' In an amendment to the Finance Bill, the government is proposing to cut the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and to abolish tax relief on exploration work. On Wednesday, it also suggested an amendment to extend transitional aid to smaller companies to cushion them from the immediate effects of the tax changes. BP said the reforms were publicly supported by companies representing 60 per cent of UK oil production. Smaller companies have led an outcry over the proposed tax changes, claiming they would halve exploration work and cost up to 30,000 jobs.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

0,FT924-9877 ,"FT924-9877 _AN-CKCCTAGHFT 921103   FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (2): To strange horizons - How exploration has changed      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   THE world's biggest oil and gas companies are turning to ever more exotic parts of the globe to look for new supplies. This so-called frontier strategy is taking companies such as British Petroleum into the Colombian jungles and British Gas into the former republics of the Soviet Union. Frontier exploration is devoted to extending the limits of known energy reserves but carries a risk much higher than companies face in their more traditional areas of influence such as the North Sea and North America. Some of this exploration is conducted in extremely hostile environments where the oil majors face many environmental drawbacks as well as possible disruption to drilling programmes by guerrilla action. In addition host governments are often unstable and could turn hostile at very short notice. The fact that many companies are prepared to run these huge risks is evidence of their often desperate search for new oil reserves. Most big discoveries are thought to have been found in the North Sea and, while there still remains a lot of oil and gas to drill, production profiles are expected to tail off towards the end of the decade. At the same time, the environmental lobby has closed much of North America for oil exploration and raised the cost for companies still operating there. Mr Robin West who advises companies on their frontier strategy at Petroleum Finance Company, the Washington-based consulting group, points out that most traditional oil majors have done a poor job of replacing their reserves of energy. British Petroleum, for example, saw the level of its proven oil reserves drop by four per cent last year, since the company has much of its production concentrated in the mature oilfields of the North Sea and Alaska. 'Companies are now being forced to turn from quick pay-out, low-risk investment in the North Sea and North America to riskier prospects,' Mr West explains. The drive for oil companies to replace their reserves with new discoveries has occurred at a time of rapid political change across the globe which has seen the opening up of many countries where governments were previously hostile to western oil companies. These countries  - from Vietnam and Russia to Laos and Yemen  - are looking to exploit mineral resources to expand hard currency earnings. They look to the oil and gas majors for valuable investment in infrastructure and development in return for drilling rights on tracts of potential oil-bearing land. Nowhere is the rush to explore more evident than in the former Soviet Union. In spite of the difficulties of negotiating with changing political regimes and large scale bureaucracy, most western companies are hoping to secure at least some acreage or production-sharing deals. British Gas recently landed exclusive rights to negotiate for the development of a huge field in Kazakhstan which is the first stage before agreeing a contract. But negotiations can drag on for months or even years and many companies have become embroiled in discussing technicalities. Mr Kenneth Derr, chairman of Chevron, the US oil major, was negotiating with Kazakhstan for over four years, but he explained the company's persistence in terms of the significance of the field in which he was interested. 'It is unique in size and could have a meaningful impact on a company of our size for a very long time.' The republics of the former Soviet Union provide a safer bet for companies looking to frontier exploration since, in spite of production difficulties, they collectively remain the world's largest producer of oil with vast proven grossly under-exploited reserves. Companies searching for oil in Vietnam, Laos and Colombia are running a greater risk of ending up with dry holes. Clyde Petroleum, a small UK exploration company, was forced to write off its Dollars 8m investment in offshore Vietnam when it discovered a large reservoir of carbon dioxide last year instead of the natural gas reserves it was hoping for. Companies must collect extremely expensive high-tech data on the country's geology before deciding where to drill which is, in the end, a subjective decision. Oil exploration is a notoriously hit-and-miss affair even in the best researched locations. Much of the impetus for frontier exploration came after the Gulf war early last year when many oil producing nations began to talk of a dialogue, if not partnership, with consumers. Most nations in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) are in need of capital to complete capacity expansion plans, but many are short of hard currency. Dr Subroto, secretary general of the organisation, estimates that its 13 members need roughly Dollars 25bn in capital over the next decade to finish expansion programmes. These capital requirements have seen Opec nations actively courting western oil companies to form partnerships that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Industry analysts call this a 'new bargain' between countries and companies. Mr Dan Yergin, who heads Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an oil consulting group and the author of The Prize, a best-selling history of the oil industry, said: 'It is the antithesis of what we saw in the 1970s when a wave of nationalism across the world led to many of these companies being thrown out of countries they were operating in.' Iran, which expelled western oil companies after the revolution in 1979, is now eager to entice them back. Tehran has even hosted conferences on producer-consumer dialogue in an effort to court wary western companies. Countries are competing for scarce cash amid global credit shortages which means they are often prepared to offer western companies extremely favourable deals in order to attract their investment and sophisticated technology. For the few companies that strike lucky in frontier exploration, the high stakes can offer rich rewards. Companies are hoping for an 'elephant'  - a discovery of 1bn barrels or more  - which will ensure earnings growth for at least a decade. British Petroleum's oil find in the foothills of the Colombian mountains is rumoured to contain more than 1bn barrels. Although the company has played down the significance of its discovery, it badly needs a boost to its reserves and, among the majors, has pioneered the risky frontier strategy. The company is painfully aware of the fact that the successful energy companies in the 1990s will be the ones that strike lucky in the jungles of Laos and Vietnam or strike favourable deals in the former Soviet Union. The stakes have been raised once more in the risky oil exploration business.  The Financial Times   London Page II  "

Dr Colin Phipps, chairman, said he was disappointed that the company's international exploration programme had 'led to a high level of write-offs during the last two years'. The Pounds 16.2m net loss for the first half of this year compared to an Pounds 11.8m loss last time. The loss per share was 4.6p (3.7p), but Dr Phipps predicted that Clyde would return to profit in 1994 and reinstate a dividend in October 1994. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said planned maintenance shutdowns at the Wytch Farm field and the Forties pipeline system in the UK led to a lower average daily output during the first half of 21,072 barrels of oil equivalent. Production had returned to normal levels and he predicted average output for the full year would be close to the 23,900 b/d achieved last year. The drop in first half production caused turnover to decline to Pounds 39.2m (Pounds 43.7m). But the company benefitted from selling forward 73 per cent of its estimated 1993 output at Dollars 18.67 per barrel, against recent prices of under Dollars 16 a barrel. Cash inflow of Pounds 25m was supplemented by the Pounds 34.2m received from the company's rights' issue last March. Gearing, currently at 100 per cent, is likely to be slightly higher by year-end, according to Mr Gourlay. But he expects it to fall to 60 per cent by next year because of the cashflow expected when the North Sea Gryphon field begins producing next month. Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in the field. Mr David Basham, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the size of the interim loss took the market 'a little bit by surprise,' and added that Clyde was 'trying to tidy up its balance sheet before the Gryphon production began.' Mr Gourlay said the company's exploration efforts would focus in future on the Netherlands, UK and Yemen. He said Clyde would be 'opportunistic' about possible disposals.

The rules of the unsupported Pole traveller are simple: carry whatever high-tec gizmos you wish, but accept no external support other than your own leg-power aided by natural resources such as gravity. The greatest technological support that is permitted within these self-imposed parameters is, of course, the ski. Using skis, my expeditions have reached the South Pole and also hold the existing world record for ski travel towards the North Pole. I learned to ski when I was in my teens with my mother and sisters in Arosa, Switzerland. With the possible exception of windsurfing, free-fall parachuting on to glaciers and being driven in London by my wife, I know of no more exhilarating and satisfying a feeling than skiing downhill on fine pistes in good weather with a bunch of speedy amateurs. For expedition work I can truly say that I love skiing. Without skis, man-hauling on snow and ice, north or south, is a doubly unsavoury experience, to be avoided at all costs. With artificial skins glued to the under-surface of our skis last March, we towed 485lb sledge-loads over Antarctica's frozen surface despite weighing a mere third of that weight ourselves. Without skis we would have sunk into deep snow at every step and would have plunged the more easily into the myriad crevasses which plagued our 97-day journey. Light-weight, tough Norwegian langlauf skis with simple plastic bindings are best for man-hauling in temperatures of - 50`C and below because they enable a pliant and bulky boot to be worn - vital for the avoidance of frost-bitten feet. Unfortunately, in Antarctica last spring - for the first time in 20 years of polar journeys - bulky boots proved inadequate for man-hauling loads of nigh-on 500lb per man. So we switched to standard plastic downhill ski boots which were rigid and allowed us enough foot purchase, when used with 'skinned' skis, to haul the mammoth loads. They also reduced my feet to poisoned, frostbitten and lacerated pain-centres. On returning to Britain I had to miss our annual skiing holiday because my feet were too swollen after our Antarctica trip, when I and my colleague Dr Mike Stroud, completed the longest ski journey in history. But in March, all being well, my wife Ginny and I will again enjoy our favourite activity (with comfortable boots and no sledge-loads) in one or other of Europe's two best all-round resorts, Zermatt or Courchevel, where we have been taking chalet holidays for 12 years now. I love these resorts equally. In Courchevel I like to get as high as possible, above 1850. I particularly enjoy the runs down from the Col de Chanrosse and the Signal area. Ginny and I usually spend half an hour or so before lunch bombing down Les Creux or towards Mont Bel Air. Zermatt has such a wide range of skiing, with some very long runs and endless permutations. My personal favourite is Triftji. The resort also has great mountain restaurants to visit at dusk after a day's skiing. Many of the instructors are of the old generation - after all, they breed Olympic medallists here. I like the way they keep the difficult runs open in bad weather for keen skiers instead of just closing them automatically - they are not safety conscious, at least not to a ridiculous degree. I love the fact that Zermatt has no cars. I hate resorts where your hotel is in a narrow street and exhaust fumes pollute the atmosphere. It spoils the whole effect of being in the mountains. We sometimes holiday with other couples who cannot ski and it doesn't matter a jot because Zermatt is great for good skiers, beginners and people who don't want to ski at all. There is so much else to do. Nevertheless, people can get on each other's nerves during a week's chalet party just as much as on a six-month Polar ordeal. After some experimenting, we have found the easiest group number to be around 10 - whether made up of five couples or a married/singles melee. It seems best to have at least four people who ski poorly or slowly ('carefully' being the adjective we use for politeness) with the balance being made up of faster types. Occasionally we find ourselves landed with a 'real' skier or 'whizzer' but this is unusual, since our group is (by chance, not choice) usually all British. On one occasion we ended up with an ox-like young friend, a purveyor of high-quality handkerchiefs and director of 'Magnificent Mouchoirs' who outskied every (non-Olympic) Brit I have ever met. None of us could keep up with him, whatever our sex, but we all tried - the males from jealousy and the females because he was dashing and handsome. Our chalet girls were both excellent skiers, and both lusted after our Hanky Man. On Day Three one of them tried too hard and twisted an ankle. He carried her down from the Klein Matterhorn run on his shoulders. Her cooking standards never recovered. On Day Six, the second chalet girl,trying to take advantage of her colleague's incapacity, ended up with her entire leg in plaster. On Day Seven, when our maestro's week was up, both girls hobbled down to the station to see their hero off. The only satisfactory outcome of that week of being enormously outclassed by the Hanky Man was when, on his penultimate evening, all 10 of us raced 4km on toboggans by night and - fuelled by gluhwein and Drambuie - reached the centre of Zermatt by a circuitous route through deep snow. Heaving his toboggan over a pointed snow-fence, our maestro's feet suddenly broke through the snow crust, impaling him astride the fence stakes. Having to ski his last few hours in a highly tender condition enabled the rest of us to score heavily and with enormous satisfaction, under the principle that he who laughs last, laughs longest - and not in a high soprano. A week's skiing is quite the best way I know of consolidating old friendships, making new ones and having a great many healthy laughs at each other's expense.

The field, known as Mars, was discovered by the two partners in 1989. It will mark the site of the deepest platform in the Gulf at 2,933ft when production starts towards the end of 1996. Shell Oil, the US subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell group, will have a 71.5 per cent interest in the development and bear a similar proportion of the costs, with BP Exploration of the US representing the remaining 28.5 per cent. For Shell Oil the development, 130 miles off the Louisiana coast from New Orleans, will mark a significant addition to production. The first phase of development is expected to yield 500m barrels of oil equivalent, with a further 200m barrels potentially available in later stages of development. The company's total proven reserves at the end of 1992 amounted to just under 2bn barrels. At its peak around the year 2000, Mars is expected to produce 100,000 b/d, not far short of the total 136,000 b/d that Shell currently produces in the Gulf of Mexico. The development is also expected to produce 110m cu ft of natural gas a day. Deep-water sites in the Gulf of Mexico have become a focus for US exploration and development as companies apply new seismic and production technology to the area. Mr John Browne, BP's London-based exploration chief, said the tension-leg platform technology used in the Mars project will, for example, 'have valuable applications both elsewhere in the Gulf of Mexico and in other parts of the world'. Although many US-based companies are investing heavily in long-term exploration elsewhere, the application of new technology has made the Gulf of Mexico a more immediate and accessible source of new production from proven reserves. BP has sold its interests in the El Qari'a gas field in the Nile Delta concession about 100 miles north of Cairo to Amoco, the US company announced in Chicago yesterday.

The figures showed that the underlying business was stable despite the Pounds 1.65bn exceptional charge taken by the company to fund its radical restructuring. The company was also able to make a fractional increase in its full year dividend to 14.5 pence a share, compared with 14.2 pence last time. Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, noted that the increased dividend was 'broadly in line with inflation.' The company still retained a policy of making achieving real rises in dividends, he said. Mr Rogerson noted that dividend cover was 1.4 times, compared with the normal level of 1.5. The loss per share after exceptional items was 6.6p, compared with a profit per share of 15.8p in 1992. But the adjusted figure, excluding exceptional charges, was 20.8p (21.8p). Despite diversification in recent years the UK gas supply business still provides the overwhelming bulk of British Gas operating profits. These were Pounds 1.16bn before exceptional charges of Pounds 1.56bn, resulting in an operating loss of Pounds 405m, compared with a Pounds 927m profit in 1992. Overseas gas supply made an operating profit of Pounds 162m (Pounds 137m), while exploration and production profits rose to Pounds 264m from Pounds 226m before. The rise in the overseas division was attributable mainly to good results from the company's distribution operations in Argentina, where it is part of a consortium supplying gas to Buenos Aires. British Gas's US trading arm, the Natural Gas Clearinghouse, also reported improved operating profits. The exploration and production side benefitted from new fields coming on stream and higher production rates from the South Morecombe field off the west coast of the UK. Analysts expect a steady increase in exploration and production profits over the next few years because of a planned rise in production volumes. Total sales volume last year was 98.9m barrels of oil equivalent, but analysts say it could rise to 150m barrels by 1995-1996. British Gas also benefits from the fact that the pricing structure of many of its gas supply contracts is linked only partially to oil prices, which could stay weak for much of this year.

Under the Mexican constitution, hydrocarbon ownership is limited to the Mexican nation. However, current practice allows Pemex, Mexico's oil monopoly, to hire private sector oil companies in exploration and drilling on condition that the contract signed is a service one - that is, that payment received does not depend on oil found. Nevertheless, in a letter to Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, the advisory committee says: 'Mexico has an unofficial, yet effective, ban on American land drilling rigs.' Offshore drilling contracts, says the report, are hampered by the need to use middlemen, and it is 'extremely difficult to obtain work even with an agent'. The advisory committee calls for a substantial liberalisation of existing laws and regulations in Mexico, saying this would 'increase the value of its (Mexico's) hydrocarbon resources'. This reform could be carried out within the current constitution. 'The US industry has demonstrated great flexibility in developing contractual arrangements for oil and gas exploration and production to accommodate a variety of legal, political and economic situations,' the letter goes on. 'If Mexican authorities are interested in obtaining outside participation in upstream activities, contractual arrangements could be developed which would meet their constitutional requirements, assure Mexico favourable investment returns, and provide US companies with incentives necessary for participation.' While Mexico's constitution limits ownership of oil to the nation, it is only the regulation which governs the constitutional article that rules out risk-sharing exploration contracts. The report highlights other areas that block foreign investment. Service stations and refineries in Mexico, it says, are solely owned by Pemex. The report concludes: 'The downstream sector should be open to foreign investment, as it is in the US and Canada. Such investments will bring necessary technology to address environmental problems.'

0,FT932-15537 ,"FT932-15537 _AN-DDMB0ABRFT 930413   FT  13 APR 93 / Treasury firm on petroleum tax proposals      By KENNETH GOODING and DAVID OWEN   THE TREASURY was last night taking a hard line over its controversial Petroleum Revenue Tax reform proposals ahead of a series of meetings between ministers and oil industry leaders. Although political pressure for a government climbdown was mounting, senior Treasury figures said the industry should not expect any changes to its proposals. The comments followed suggestions that the government might be prepared to go some way towards addressing the industry's concerns by fine-tuning the transition arrangements, particularly to meet some of the objections over the retrospective nature of the changes. The oil industry is finding it difficult to present a united front against the changes because there are some companies that stand to gain substantially in terms of increased cashflow. Nevertheless, the industry seems united over one issue - the retrospective nature of the tax changes. Companies say they applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for licences to explore in the North Sea on the understanding that the rules would not change. As part of the application process they committed themselves to drill a certain number of wells. Some suggest that they could not fulfil these obligations without tax relief. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has said that if companies had already entered into contracts for drilling wells they could still apply for tax relief. But oil companies want that undertaking to cover 'firm commitments' they have made to drill wells. The Treasury yesterday dismissed these arguments and suggested there was no legal requirement for oil companies to stick to exploration targets agreed with the DTI. The new rules will lower the rate of tax paid on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it altogether for new fields. They also remove tax relief on exploration and appraisal work in the North Sea, a change that will hit many of the small independent companies hard. The industry suggests that the changes will quadruple the cost of exploring in the North Sea. Oil operators are warning that they will have to scale down exploration severely if the changes go ahead. A survey found that 85 per cent of oil companies expected job losses to result from the changes.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

0,FT932-10055 ,"FT932-10055 _AN-DEKCSADSFT 930511   FT  11 MAY 93 / Gamble in the North Sea: UK oil tax reforms raise crucial questions about resource management      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and DAVID LASCELLES   Few measures in the March Budget created as much of a rumpus as Mr Norman Lamont's proposals to reform the taxation of North Sea oil. Apart from opening up divisions within the oil industry, they raised crucial questions about how the UK should manage this important resource. The repercussions reach parliament today with the debate on the finance bill, for which a senior backbench MP has tabled amendments intended to cushion the impact of the changes. But the government, in the person of Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, who is responsible for the measure, is refusing to yield. 'I have listened to all the representations we have received, and none of them contained anything that we had not considered before the Budget,' he says. Although the debate will be about the extent to which oil companies should be allowed to set their exploration costs against their oil taxes, the real issue is how the UK should make the most of its remaining oil and gas reserves. Should they be treated as a strategic asset and exploited to the full or only as the market dictates? Mr Lamont, the chancellor of the Exchequer, is proposing to cut the petroleum revenue tax (PRT) on existing large North Sea fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, and to eliminate the tax altogether on new fields. But at the same time, he wants to end oil companies' right to set their exploration costs against their total PRT bill. The effect will be to make production from developed fields more profitable, but increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies which have been able to take advantage of the PRT offset. In his Budget speech Mr Lamont described PRT as 'increasingly anachronistic'. It was introduced in 1975 at a time of surging production and high oil prices to ensure that the Exchequer got its fair share of oil profits. Today, with the oil price close to a 20-year low in real terms, there is less incentive to increase production at such a high tax rate. The ostensible aim of the changes, therefore, is to adapt the North Sea tax regime to the requirements of a mature oil province where further large finds are unlikely and interest has shifted to making the most of developed reserves. But the underlying motive is also to boost tax revenues. The Exchequer's earnings from the North Sea have fallen from a peak of Pounds 12.2bn in 1984-85 (more than half of it from PRT, and the rest coming from royalties and corporation tax), to only Pounds 1.35bn last year, of which a mere Pounds 50m came from PRT. Although the Treasury will lose from the cut in the PRT rate, this loss will be more than offset, it says, by the abolition of exploration allowances, leaving a net addition to tax revenues of Pounds 300m next year and Pounds 400m the year after that. A third motive is to bring North Sea taxation in line with the government's overall approach of reducing tax rates and eliminating allowances. According to Mr Dorrell, PRT at 75 per cent is the highest rate of any tax in the country and the abolition of allowances will stop oil companies effectively exploring at the taxpayers' expense. But in trying to boost its revenues and bring oil taxation in line with its fiscal philosophy, will the Treasury actually damage the prospects for the North Sea? There is a danger that Mr Lamont will kill the incentive to explore at the very moment when the UK needs to make that extra push to find its last, difficult, fields. Will oil companies reinvest the savings from lower PRT to squeeze more out of the North Sea or will they just pocket the money and spend it elsewhere? More broadly, there is the question of whether the new tax regime will handicap the UK in the increasingly competitive international market for oil company investment. These various issues depend on how the outlook for the North Sea is viewed. Contrary to popular perceptions, Britain's oil production has not peaked. Output is forecast to reach record levels of more than 125m tonnes in the middle of this decade. As for reserves, the UK has extracted a total of 1.6bn tonnes of oil to date, and has between 610m and 2.1bn tonnes of recoverable reserves left. The Department of Trade and Industry estimates in its latest Brown Book (its oil and gas annual) that there could also be between 530m and 3.3bn tonnes to be discovered. In addition, output and reserves of natural gas, which are playing a fast-growing role in the country's energy balance, are both rising. So while the North Sea may be mature in the sense that it is well explored and developed, it is far from being played out. The Treasury's view is that the days of jumbo discoveries are past, and that the job now is to ensure that known fields produce their maximum yield. This view is supported, predictably perhaps, by Shell and BP, operators of two of the largest fields in the North Sea, Brent and Forties, who stand to gain from the PRT cuts. Mr Chris Fay, managing director of exploration and production at Shell, believes that more than half of the North Sea's oil has either been pumped out already or is currently under development. This leaves a quarter which has been discovered and not yet developed. 'The Budget is rewarding successful exploration by reducing production taxes, but any exploration must be carefully costed and justified rather than be merely a gamble as was often the case under the old regime,' Mr Fay said. However, the Treasury's argument is strongly opposed by smaller companies who have taken the lead in the North Sea exploration effort as discoveries have got smaller. They warn that the abolition of PRT allowances will lead to a sharp drop in drilling and appraisal activity. Where it is currently worthwhile for a company to develop a field of 15m barrels, the new tax regime would quadruple costs and raise that threshold to 60m barrels, these companies say. The consequence will be fewer additions to oil reserves and therefore, ultimately, less tax revenue for the Exchequer, to say nothing of lost jobs and other social costs. 'It means that there will be a tranche of oil and gas reserves that will not be exploited,' says Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer at Lasmo, the independent company with large North Sea interests. 'They'd rather leave that unexploited than give back the tax benefits. I hope that they have struck the right balance.' Judging by the concern shown by many backbench MPs, the public is also worried that the UK will fail to make the most of its oil assets. The combination of low oil prices, rising costs and harder-to-find reserves has already led to a fall in the number of exploration wells being drilled. This suggests that incentives to explore should be sharpened, rather than reduced, these MPs believe. But Mr Dorrell decries what he describes as 'the National Coal Board culture of seeking to recover a resource regardless of the cost'. It is not in the country's interest, he says, to provide tax breaks for companies to develop oil and gas deposits which are not economic in their own right. He believes it is the country's duty to leave them in the ground for future generations to develop when technological advances or rising energy prices make them economic. He wants to change the North Sea from a low-risk, low-reward province to one where oil companies take more of the risk, but also keep more of the profit if they are successful. If this results in oil being left in the ground, that is what the market thinks best, according to Mr Dorrell. The threat of a sharp fall in exploration may have been exaggerated by independent companies who stand to lose their tax breaks. As much as 40 per cent of current exploration activity is being conducted by companies which pay no PRT against which to offset the cost, Mr Dorrell says. The other important uncertainty is whether the government is correct in assuming that oil companies will reinvest their PRT savings in the North Sea. Again, the oil majors are promising big benefits as development projects are accelerated to take advantage of lower PRT. Mr David Simon, chief executive of British Petroleum, said: 'The PRT changes will bring more barrels out of the North Sea. Some projects will move up the pecking order of priorities worldwide because of the new tax regime.' BP yesterday announced it would develop nine oil fields in the central North Sea earlier than planned because of the Budget changes. The company said that development of the fields - the Eastern Trough Area Project, which will cost between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn over the next five years - was given a 'significant impetus' by the new PRT rules. But the smaller companies take a different line. Mr Francis Gugen, finance director of Amerada Hess, points out that even after the PRT cut, profits from large North Sea fields will be taxed at 71 per cent by the time corporation tax is added in. 'Why invest in something with that sort of tax rate when you could invest elsewhere?' he asks. Amerada has said that it will transfer exploration out of the UK North Sea if the Budget changes go through. Whether a flight of drill rigs out of the North Sea actually occurs depends on how the UK stacks up against other oil producing regions. Under the new regime, the rate of tax on North Sea profits would range from 33 per cent on fields exempt from PRT, to 71 per cent on fields that pay it. This is a relatively low rate by international standards (in Norway companies pay a flat 78 per cent). But the abolition of allowances will put the UK at a disadvantage to Norway which allows full tax relief for exploration and where geologists believe there are still large fields yet to be discovered. In spite of the high costs and maturity of the North Sea, a study by Wood MacKenzie, the oil analysis group in Edinburgh, found that the UK still compares well with other countries in its attractiveness for drilling. The study was completed before the PRT changes, but Wood MacKenzie believes they will not affect the appeal of the UK's oil and gas resources. Wood MacKenzie plotted the number of commercial oil discoveries against the number of wells drilled for nine countries in three distinct regions worldwide: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam in south-east Asia; Angola, Congo and Gabon in west Africa; and Norway and the UK in the North Sea. The analysts found that, in the past 20 years, the UK was behind only Norway in the number of commercial oil finds. But because of its increasing maturity, the UK slipped into sixth place when it was ranked on the success of wells in finding commercial oil discoveries in the past five years. The study also compares the countries on a risk-reward basis which ranks the drilling success rate with the attractiveness of the fiscal regime. This was conducted before the PRT changes. The UK ranked joint second with the Congo after Vietnam. But Wood MacKenzie stresses the importance of the host government's attitude to the oil industry in attracting its migratory capital. Mr David Black, an industry consultant at Wood MacKenzie said: 'One of the disappointing features of this PRT change is that the UK was always regarded by the industry as politically and fiscally stable: everyone knew how you played the game, but this has been destroyed at a stroke.' Mr Black said the lack of consultation over the changes and the retrospective nature of the move had shocked the industry. The industry still hopes that the Treasury will agree to transitional arrangements to soften the blow and restore the UK's hospitable image. These arrangements, proposed by Mr John Butterfill, MP for Bournemouth West, and other senior Tory backbenchers, involve continuing tax relief for wells where companies have made commitments to drill but have not yet started work. This will be financed by raising the proposed PRT rate from 50 per cent to 55 per cent until the end of 1996. Mr Lamont is taking quite a gamble with his proposed reforms. If they work, he will have called the oil industry's bluff about their potentially disastrous impact. Britain will enjoy the double benefit of continued exploration and more intensively managed North Sea fields. But if he has misjudged the situation he may not only stifle new exploration, but he could also kiss goodbye to billions of dollars worth of future North Sea investment.

0,FT944-12447 ,"FT944-12447 _AN-EKAEZAHIFT 941101   FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (3): The lining is golden - Mines survive new land rules      By BRUCE JACQUES   For the Australian mining industry the much feared 'era of Mabo' has begun without interrupting the long-standing trend of steadily increased production and export revenue. Mabo is the popular tag given to a watershed High Court decision given legislative effect late in 1993 through the Native Title Bill. The Bill, which broadly gives Australia's Aboriginal people title to large tracts of the country, had drawn dire predictions from the mining lobby, mainly reflecting concerns about exploration and development access. However, in 1993-4, the industry has again overcome weak world demand, historically low prices for many key commodities and unfavourable exchange rate movements marginally to lift export revenue to almost ADollars 30bn, accounting for better than 35 per cent of the country's total export receipts. Figures from ABARE, the Federal Government's commodities research arm, show that Australia's mineral exports have risen in all but one year of the past decade. The latest total represents more than double the country's then record ADollars 14.9bn mineral exports in 1986. While this performance justifies the industry's world leader status, demonstrating its inherent strength and diversity, closer inspection reveals some weak spots which threaten to reduce momentum later this decade. The industry acknowledges that the effects on production and revenues may not be felt for some years, given the lead times involved in major projects. But mining executives see Mabo as part of a long term pattern of adversity which includes the rise of environmental issues, compensation claims from landowners, unfavourable tax treatment and vexatious litigation. Mr Geoffrey Ewing, of the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC), says the mining industry has long been a leader in negotiating with Aboriginal communities. 'Our argument is not with the concept of native title, but with the way the Bill produces an unwieldy system for exploration and development access,' Mr Ewing said. 'Any real influence on production and exports is obviously some years off. In fact, our annual financial survey, due out later this year, will probably show a lift in exploration spending in the latest year. But our information is that the spending is mainly on what could be described as 'brownfields', sites which are free of any native title claims.' The Australian mineral industry's overall performance in the latest year was also distorted by near boom conditions in one commodity - gold - where export value rose by more than 26 per cent to ADollars 5.42bn, masking some serious declines in other commodities. Gold's resurgence echoes its historical position as one of the main populators of fledgling antipodean colonies more than a century ago. The metal's more recent Australian history is scarcely less important to national fortunes. From a position of decline in the 1970s, when many of the country's biggest mines faced closure and annual output ran at less than three tonnes, Australian gold production has rallied close to 250 tonnes in the current year, ranking it third in the world after South Africa and the US. And new projects already under way mean that production will keep rising strongly, barring a collapse in the all-too-volatile gold price. Mr Robin Widdup, gold analyst with J. B. Were  Son, the Australian stockbrokers, told the Financial Times World Gold Conference in June that Australia's annual gold production was likely to top 300 tonnes by the turn of the century. Vigorous exploration and new mine development has transformed the gold industry from the 1980s picture of short life, shallow oxide open pits, to large long life mines in the 1990s,' Mr Widdup said. 'The 1990s Australian gold rush has seen geologists, armed with new geochemical and geophysical techniques, unearth a series of large new gold discoveries beneath sand cover. 'This breakthrough in technology has lifted exploration expenditure  .. and the rate of success shows no sign of slowing. A group of 10 to 15 new mines should lift Australian production by 40 to 50 tonnes over the next five years.' If gold fulfils these expectations, it could replace coal as Australia's number one export earner around the turn of the century. Gold's export jump in the latest year compared with a corresponding 5 per cent fall to just under ADollars 7.2bn for coal. Several other major Australian minerals recorded solid export revenue gains in 1993-94, including aluminium, up 5 per cent to ADollars 1.82bn and iron, steel and ferroalloys, up 22 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn. But zinc exports fell 22 per cent to ADollars 795m. Sticking to a familiar pattern, Australia's higher overall export receipts were achieved despite markedly lower average commodity prices received. ABARE's mineral export price index slumped from 99.7 to 91.9 over the year while the index of mine production rose from 105.2 to 107. Australia is, quite simply, continuing to sell more minerals for less money. The financial performance of its leading commodities companies remains volatile. It's a habit that will prove hard to kick while the industry remains a price taker, hostage to a small local market and heavily exposed to the vagaries of international trade.

The Deputy Director, Xie Zhiqiang, of the Tarim Petroleum  Prospecting and Development Directorate, announced that during  four years of prospecting in northern and central Tarim,  covering an area of over 30,000 square kilometers, over 95,000  kilometers of two-dimensional digital seismic prospecting, and  2,200 kilometers of three-dimensional prospecting have been  completed, 169 exploratory wells have been drilled, totalling  970,000 meters of drilling footage, and industrial-grade oil and  gas flows have been found at 81 wells. Six oil fields that have  been confirmed or basically confirmed and ready for exploitation  are the Lunnan, Sangtamu, Donghetang, Jilake, Jiefang Qudong,  and Tazhong-4 oil fields. Three hundred million tons of oil  reserves and about 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas  reserves are basically confirmed and under control. What is  especially satisfying is that the Tazhong-4 oil field, which has  130 million tons of reserves, has the resources to assure the  construction of a 5-million ton crude oil production capability.  This year, the Tazhong-10 and Tazhong-6 wells have each produced  high-output flows of oil and gas, demonstrating that central  Tarim is an area of large-sized oil fields.    Important gains have also been made in development and  construction. Construction of crude oil production capabilities  of 1.4 million tons was begun at Lunnan, Sangtamu, and Jiefang  Qudong oil fields last year. The production capacity of  Donghetang oil field was expanded from 750,000 tons to 2.15  million tons last year. One hundred and sixty five kilometers of  the 230-kilometer Taklimakan desert highway have been completed,  and it is expected to be open to the Tazhong-4 oil field by the  end of June next year; 140 kilometers of the oil-field pipeline  have also been completed this year.    Petroleum exploration will be further accelerated during the  next three years. It is estimated that by 1995 confirmed and  controlled petroleum geology reserves will be 800 million tons,  and in 1996 the annual output of crude oil will be 5 million  tons.    The US$500 million loaned by the Xinjiang Branch of the Bank  of China for petroleum exploration and development in Tarim will  be used over the next two years to buy facilities, precision  instruments, and desert transportation vehicles needed for the  oil field.

'We share the concern of the industry about the growing potential power of citizen suits and the increasing legal fuzziness of issues like land 'suitability' and 'acceptable' environmental compliance', say analysts Amy Gassman and Alexandra Zawadiwsky. They suggest a 'compromise' version of the mining law reform is likely to be passed during 1994 and this could affect the earnings of several gold mining companies from 1995 onwards. The analysts say it is likely that gross royalties between 3 per cent and 5 per cent could be levied on federal unpatented lands and add 'we believe the industry can live with a moderate new royalty structure.' They point out that only a very small number of exploration prospects eventually become mines. 'Thus, to introduce greater uncertainty into the exploration process (will the project receive permits, will it be located on suitable lands?) further reduces the already-slim probabilities associated with the search for new mines. In order to increase the probabilities, miners are looking (outside the US) where there has not been as much activity.' However, this move to offshore exploration also 'reflects the intersection of several positive trends - the move toward a market economy and democratic government in several Latin American countries, the availability of large areas of unexplored prospective acreage offshore, the passage of new mining legislation to protect ownership rights and the ability to remit profits - at the very time that the process for exploring and developing properties in the US is becoming more uncertain and time-consuming.' The existing Mining Act of 1872 has been under attack by some US politicians for years because it enables mining companies to apply for a patent on federal land on which they are mining or plan to mine for a one-time fee of Dollars 5 an acre. Also, once patented, the land and the minerals contained in it are transferred from the public to the private sector and are exempt from any further rental or royalty payments to the Federal Treasury. Critics say the present system does not provide a financial return to the American people for the use of public domain lands.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Energy Undersecretary Rufino Bomasang said President Ramos  was informed yesterday of the latest find in West Linapacan, the  country's biggest oil field.    The find was made as the West Linapacan consortium was  drilling a sidetrack well dubbed as A-5 to stop water seepage in  the original well.    Water encroachment in the Linapacan wells cut their  production level from a high of 18,000 barrels a day (BOPD)  early last year to 5,000 BOPD in December 1993.    Consortium representatives told DOE officials last Friday  that the A-5 well encountered continuous very good oil shows in  the limestone up to a depth of 8,020 feet.    The operators said the oil-water contact in the A-5 well is  lower than that in the A-3 well, giving an additional 400 feet  of oil column.    An energy department source said the discovery of a new oil  section may boost the production of crude from West Linapacan.    The consortium also reported that the A-5 well may have  combination gas and water drive which would enhance oil recovery.    Three drill stem tests (DST) are to be conducted in A-5 this  week after which the well will be completed for production and  hooked up the storage tanker. [sentence as published]    Alcorn (Production) Phils., Inc., the operator of the field,  has a 23.4 percent stake in Linapacan. Its partners are  Oriental Petroleum  Minerals Corp. (36.6 percent); Basic  Petroleum (11 percent); Alcorn Petroleum and Minerals (7.4  percent); Alcorn Phils. Inc. (5.6 percent); Petrofields (5  percent); Philodrill (4 percent); Seafront (4 percent); Unioil  (2 percent); and Balabac Oil (1 percent).    Still on the oil sector, Shell Philippines Exploration Corp.  (SPEX) and Occidental Petroleum are eyeing two of the world's  biggest oil exploration firms as partners in the $2 billion  worth development of the Camago-Malampaya field in Northwest  Palawan, the largest gas find in the country.    An industry source said that Atlantic Richfield Co. (Arco),  one of the top ten oil exploration firms in the United States,  and Total Corp., a French oil company, are negotiating  separately with Shell and Oxy.    Arco recently won the geophysical and seismic exploration  contract (GSEC) covering the Sulu Sea.    The source said that SPEX and Oxy, operators of the  Camago-Malampaya field, are willing to offer up to 15 percent  each to a foreign partner. Shell and Oxy each have a 50 percent  stake in Camago-Malampaya.    Shell and Oxy have started inviting foreign oil companies to  join the Camago-Malampaya development last February.    Shell and Oxy has shortlisted some five companies as  possible  partners which include Arco and Total.    Shell and Oxy are willing to accept investors who would be  able to carry their share of a $2-billion project.    A 1 percent participating interest in Camago-Malampaya may  be  worth some $20 million.    Earlier, sources said that the two oil exploration companies  were not inclined to dilute the ownership of the field.    Last February, Shell and Oxy started the drilling of two  wells.    Two more wells are expected to be drilled to confirm  reserves  of three to five trillion cubic feet (TCF) of natural gas and a  minimum of 100 million barrels.    Bomasang earlier said the Camago-Malampaya field could  supply  Luzon at least 600 million cubic feet of gas per day through an  undersea pipeline.    The amount will be enough to sustain the fuel requirements  of  a 3,000-megawatt (Mw) power plant by the year 2000.    According to Bomasang, an early production system will  produce oil at 20,000 to 50,000 barrels per day by 1996 and if  the reserves are adequate, a final production system of 10,000  to 20,000 BOPD would be set up by 1999.

The issue is intended to finance exploration and strengthen the company's balance sheet by retiring debt. Mr Lindsay MacAlister, managing director, said Pancontinental wanted to strengthen its overall position before deciding whether to increase capacity at its Kunwarara magnesite operation in Queensland. The proposed expansion would increase capacity for deadburn magnesia to 150,000 tonnes a year from 100,000, and boost production of electrofused magnesia to 25,000 tonnes from 15,000. Mr MacAlister said Pancontinental would require ADollars 20m over three years for increased exploration and evaluation of mineral prospects and a further ADollars 20m to optimise capacity at the mines and associated facilities. Pancontinental said it would concentrate expenditure on the Paddington/Kundana gold mines in Western Australia, the Thalanga base metals operation in Queensland, and the tantalum mine at Wodgina in Western Australia. The company said about 55.52m shares would be issued with acceptances closing on July 3.  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "

The UK Offshore Operators' Association, the oil industry group, has drafted a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, saying that many companies will be unable to meet previous commitments made to the government over future drilling activity because of the planned PRT changes. A survey published yesterday by Ernst and Young, the accountants, found that 85 per cent of oil companies expect job losses to result from the PRT changes. Some 40 per cent of the respondents expected job losses to be much higher than the Treasury's estimate of 10,000. The changes to the PRT regime would reduce the tax rate for existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it for new fields. The chancellor also proposed to abolish tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. This means that companies will have to pay 64p for every pound spent on drilling activity, compared with 17p now. Companies say they applied for previous licences to explore for oil in the North Sea on the basis that the rules would stay the same. As part of those applications, they committed themselves to drilling a certain number of wells. If no tax relief is available for exploration, many companies will be unable to fulfil their obligations, the industry argues. But its response to the new rules is complicated by a row between winners and losers from the changes. Amerada Hess has said it will halve its exploration activity, but British Petroleum said the changes would improve recovery of oil from existing fields. Many companies want some transitional relief - the chancellor has said that if companies had already entered into contracts for drilling wells, they can still apply for tax relief. Companies want that to be extended to firm commitments for drilling wells. Analysts reckon that as part of previous licensing arrangements, the industry is commited to drilling 170 wells over the next couple of years. Last year 116 wells were drilled in the North Sea, and some estimates expect this to drop off to just 80 this year as a result of the depressed oil price and the PRT changes. An average of one in seven wells strikes oil. Oil sector at odds, Page 9   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

0,FT942-15139 ,"FT942-15139 _AN-EDQALADHFT 940416   FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: Stock prospectors wary of oil - Bottom Line      By ROBERT CORZINE   Stock market investors keen to have a flutter on the oil price usually look beyond the big, integrated oil majors such as British Petroleum and Shell to smaller exploration and production stocks. This week one of the largest companies in the sector, Lasmo, announced a deeply discounted Pounds 219m rights issue to shore up a balance sheet ravaged by a Pounds 794m debt. Management said strong operating cash flows have been undermined by the steep fall in oil prices over the past year, to current average levels Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend. Price weakness called into question the company's ability to carry out its ambitious plans to cut its high-cost production base by developing low-cost oil and gas reserves. Analysts have long considered Lasmo the company in the exploration / production sector most vulnerable to weak oil prices. Its agony as oil prices plumeted over the past year has been marked by a trail of casualties: in early 1993 it dropped Chris Greentree as chief executive in favour of Joe Darby. Changes have also been made to its finance director and non-executive chairman. In addition its shares were among the worst performers in 1993 and it passed its final dividend last month. Investors may therefore be wondering whether Lasmo's plight is unique, or a sign that similar troubles might spread to other companies in the sector. After all, as the chart shows, the performance of the exploration and production sector has been relatively resilient in recent months in spite of oil prices falling to five-year lows. Furthermore, asset values in the sector do not fully reflect oil prices at recent lows. Analysts have mixed views on the sector, but most agree that Lasmo's case is unique in at least one crucial sense; its investment cycle and therefore its debt load is seriously out of synch with the oil price. The company is entering a two-year period of large-scale development commitments for schemes such as Liverpool Bay, a big natural gas project which will generate significant cash after 1996. It already had financing for Liverpool Bay and other projects, but at current prices Lasmo's high-cost production profile makes the company unprofitable. Analysts say a successful rights issue will give Lasmo the breathing space it needs over the next two years. Other exploration companies have also seen their cash flow suffer because of weak oil prices. But most, including Enterprise, the biggest independent explorer, find themselves at more comfortable points in the capital investment cycle. Does the sector deserve its relatively high valuation given the continuing uncertainty over oil price? Brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull think not. In a recount report they argue that investors are perpetually over-optimistic about oil price trends: 'Equity investors . . . have been only too keen to pay over the odds in order to acquire oil and gas reserves via the stock market at prices which the oil and gas industry itself has not been prepared to pay.' The brokers add that the 'anomaly between stockmarket versus industry reserve valuation obviously creates good opportunities for energy companies to raise finance in the equity markets.' Other analysts disagree. They point to recent asset sales in the North Sea which valued reserves at Dollars 15-Dollars 17 a barrel, proof they say, that the industry believes current prices are not a realistic long-term prospect. But for private investors the attractiveness of a flutter on the sector still rests on whether they think the oil price will increase, and whether they feel lucky.   Companies:-  Lasmo.

0,FT922-10155 ,"FT922-10155 _AN-CEBAEABVFT 920502   FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets: Oil stocks are only for the strong-hearted - The Bottom Line      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   TONY Craven-Walker, chief executive of Monument Oil and Gas, spends much of his time pondering ways in which small oil companies can offer value for shareholders. Monument is one of the UK's band of independent exploration and production companies. These put so much money into searching for oil that there is seldom any left to pay dividends. At the same time, the rise and fall of their share prices is tied closely to the fluctuations in world oil prices. This year oil prices are low: for UK companies forced to cope with the dollar-sterling exchange rate, they have sunk to their lowest level in real terms for 20 years. Low oil prices have pushed UK oil company stock prices into the doldrums. What is more, the stock market has started to lose faith in a long-term increase in oil prices which undermines the argument for buying into the sector in the first place. Craven-Walker would like to find a novel way of offering a pay-out to shareholders. In any case, Monument can offer more long-term value than some of its counterparts because of its stake in the Morecambe Bay field in the North Sea. This field produces gas for which there is strong UK demand at prices which are often uncoupled from the oil market. The last week has seen a small pick-up in the price of oil, giving a boost to oil sector shares. But the price rise was probably more for technical reasons than because of any strong upturn in demand and is unlikely to be sustained. Chris Fay, exploration director at Shell, has commented that the industry is working on the margin of economic viability. Most UK oil companies can make money with oil prices at around Dollars 18 a barrel but those with high costs such as Lasmo and Clyde Petroleum will struggle. At the same time, almost all exploration companies are trimming their drilling budgets this year which lowers their chances of an oil find. With the oil sector underperforming the FT-All Share index by at least 10 per cent this year, some pundits argue that oil stocks are a cheap buy. Not everyone agrees: 'The sector is bombed out, but there has been a significant change in perceptions about future oil prices. I don't think this has been fully reflected in share prices yet and they could still fall relative to the market,' said Simon Flowers, industry analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh. County NatWest has joined many other industry observers in revising its forecast for oil prices downwards to Dollars 23 a barrel in 1997 compared with its previous estimate of Dollars 26 a barrel. It bases this on commitments by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost production capacity along with expectations of a slow increase in world oil demand. Money invested in oil stocks is a hedge on the future direction of oil prices in general. More specifically, investors could be expressing confidence in a small company's ability to find oil. But this is a big bet. Oil stocks, particularly the small independent exploration companies, should carry a health warning. Investors who piled into Kelt Energy when its share price hit Pounds 3 three years ago as the company looked as if it was having a successful run on exploration, have seen their holding plunge to virtually nothing today. A group of banks is running the company in a bid to recoup some of the money lent. Tullow Oil is currently generating a lot of excitement: it is focused purely on oil exploration and has enjoyed some success. Investors could easily see the value of their holdings double if the company makes a big discovery, but they could equally lose their entire stake. Shell and British Petroleum are much a safer bets on the oil price. Of these two, Shell is financially stronger and its shares are likely to continue their steady rise while dividends keep pace with inflation over the long haul. BP is more risky since if oil prices continue in their current vein, it is unlikely to be able to sustain dividend payments at current rates. In spite of the gloom over future oil prices, the sector could still prove lucrative for the strong-hearted investor. Oil prices have a tendency to confound expectations. Any political upset in the Middle East could send prices soaring while exploration stocks take off.  The Financial Times   London Page II  "

Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, opens a Pakistan investment conference in London today at which investors in various sectors, including petroleum, will be urged to step forward with new investment plans. Among the important developments in the petroleum sector this year, the government has committed itself to processing all requests for exploration from foreign companies within three months. Previously it could take more than two years before a company was granted an exploration licence. Foreign investors have also been assured full freedom to repatriate capital and profits, and will be allowed full ownership of local companies. Pakistan has an important stake in the success of this effort, in particular for the improvement of its balance of trade. Last year, the country imported oil worth over USDollars 1.8bn, about a sixth of its total import bill. It requires up to 280,000 barrels of oil a day but produces just under 60,000. Aside from encouraging investors to become more active in exploration, new agreements have been signed recently for the setting up of six new oil refineries. At present Pakistan has capacity to refine up to 140,000 barrels a day at three plants. These plants, however, are in need of large scale repairs and modernisation, senior officials say. The government estimates that it will receive investments worth over Dollars 1.9bn for oil refineries from private investors by the end of this decade. Its optimism over the success of its effort is based largely on estimates of over 197m barrels of crude oil in reserves. These are mainly located in the south-western province of Baluchistan and the southern province of Sindh. 'We hope to further accelerate these activities,' says Mr Anwar Saifullah Khan, minister for petroleum and natural resources. 'We take weeks in taking a decision rather than years,' he says, adding that the new measures have given fresh encouragement to oil companies. Mr Khan is encouraged by recent agreements with Occidental Petroleum and Union Texas to drill more exploratory wells. He expects Shell and Omani oil company also to be given exploration licences and claims that in addition to the 18 foreign oil companies doing business in Pakistan, at least 30 more have shown an interest in examining the possibilities of exploratory work. The petroleum minister is convinced that developments in this sector will be crucial for the success of the country's effort to set up new power generation plants, especially oil-fired thermal units. 'With the setting up of all these thermal units, you'll need a lot of oil' he says. Despite the government's commitment, some analysts are still nervous over possible setbacks. Concern is running high that law and order problems could affect the work of oil companies, especially in remote parts of Sindh and Baluchistan. These could include armed robberies and demands for huge pay-offs from tribal chiefs before allowing exploration work to begin. Recent reports that the government of Baluchistan and the federal government in Islamabad have still not agreed on important issues, such as the division of royalties, has added to such concerns. Mr Khan denies, however, that there are any disagreements. Nevertheless, Mr Wazir Ahmed Jogezai, a former deputy speaker of the parliament in Islamabad and a politician from Baluchistan, warns that such 'bottlenecks' must be removed before the new incentives can succeed. 'The foreign investor has got to be given an assured law and order situation. What would you do in the wilderness of Baluchistan if you have an area and you can't really get in there?' he asks.

But an event that took place off the US west coast 25 years ago has a particular relevance to residents of environmentally sensitive seaside areas in the UK such as Christchurch. In 1969, a blow-out at an offshore production platform left 30 miles of beach near Santa Barbara, one of southern California's main tourist destinations, covered in oil pollution. The impact of the spill on public opinion was such that development of the state's rich offshore oilfields was curtailed for decades, while the political fallout from it is felt even now. Hazel O'Leary, US energy secretary, recently confirmed that residents of coastal states still have a virtual veto over new offshore oil developments. The Santa Barbara spill has also had a lasting effect on how the international oil industry operates in sensitive coastal areas, including those in the UK. Over the next few years, oil companies plan to increase inshore exploration drilling, encouraged by coastal discoveries such as the Wytch Farm oilfield near Poole in Dorset and the Liverpool Bay natural gas field. In last year's 14th licensing round, the government included a large number of inshore blocks, many of which are located near well-known coastal beauty spots, important fishing or breeding grounds, or in areas which support endangered species. But the special requirements of operating inshore often conflict with established ways of working in the North Sea, according to Geoff Nicholson, manager of near-shore exploration projects for Elf Enterprise, a joint venture between Elf Aquitaine of France and Enterprise Oil, the biggest UK independent. It has been active in Poole Bay on the south coast and is about to begin exploration in the Irish Sea, 15 miles off Anglesey. 'The industry likes to move fast and with few constraints,' he says. In the North Sea, the sudden availability of a drilling rig at an attractive rate can cause companies to alter plans overnight. In the exploration phase, oil companies also tend to operate at an arm's length through specialist contractors. 'But you can't operate like that inshore,' says Nicholson. 'Long periods of consultation with local governments and community groups are necessary before actual operations, such as seismic surveys or drilling, can begin.' Senior Elf executives say it is as important to understand the 'geo-political aspects' of England's south coast as it is of south Yemen or the other remote locations in which the oil industry operates. Elf's emphasis on the careful identification and cultivation of community groups is no accident. In 1992, its initial exploration efforts in Poole Bay ended in angry confrontations at sea between seismic survey ships and local fishermen. The company had reached an early agreement on compensating those who fished for crab and lobster. But it struggled to reach an understanding with the trawlermen. 'We first had to define who was a fisherman,' says Nicholson. 'In the winter someone might be a painter and decorator, but in summer they might do a little fishing.' In addition, some political pressure groups saw the chance to use Elf's dispute with the fishermen to their own advantage. Elf eventually had to pay out more than Pounds 1m in compensation to the fishermen. 'We had to solve the dispute on the run and in a very unsatisfactory way,' concedes Nicholson. The problems of dealing with 10 different fishing associations persuaded the company to set up and fund a forum in which to channel problems. It also provides a mechanism for arbitration. The fragmented nature of the fishing industry made it the most difficult for Elf to deal with. But many other groups also saw the company as a threat. Some were concerned that even the hint of an oil spill offshore in summer could do long-lasting damage to the area's important tourist industry. Others simply did not want oil companies operating in their back yard. 'I don't care if you drink your bloody oil,' was the attitude of one resident at a public meeting. Late last year, Elf drilled an exploratory well, the results of which it has yet to divulge. The licence for Poole Bay was issued in an earlier round, but Elf observed many of the environmental conditions set by the government for 14th round licences. Seabed studies were carried out both before and after drilling to determine if there was any damage to marine life. A narrower than usual well was specified to cut down on the amount of rock cuttings brought to the surface. Water-based drilling muds were used when possible in preference to oil-based ones to lubricate the drill bit. Rock cuttings brought to the surface were cleaned before being dispersed over a wide area - rather than piled on the sea bottom - to avoid smothering fish feeding grounds. And the normal stand-by safety vessel was augmented by one carrying a chemical dispersant and booms to contain any spills. Local officials say such precautions have made inshore exploration drilling acceptable to the public. But they say the prospect of permanent platforms within sight of land is no more acceptable now than in 1988 when a British Petroleum proposal to build an artificial island off Wytch Farm to tap the offshore extension of the field triggered a storm of protest along the south coast. New technology, in the form of horizontal drilling from a land base to a point more than 5km offshore, solved BP's problem. But technology is unlikely to offer a solution in all cases. At some time in the next few years an inshore discovery could be made that will test whether coastal residents in the UK have a similar power of veto as their counterparts in California.

""We are concerned over developments that tend to disrupt the  equilibrium in the region. But we hope that China and Vietnam  can resolve this amicably, and later all claimants can proceed  multilaterally on the issue,"" Foreign Affairs Undersecretary  Rodolfo Severino said.    ""Although this is a bilateral problem, but since its impact  has reverberations in the region, then all claimants have an  interest in what happens,"" Severino added.    The latest row between China and Vietnam, two of the six  claimants to the Spratly Islands, stemmed from China's grant of  oil exploration rights to the Colorado-based Crestone Energy  Corp. over a 25,000 square kilometer area of the South China  Sea, which Vietnam claimed was within its continental shelf.    Vietnam warned that Crestone's decision to proceed with its  exploration of the disputed area was a ""serious violation of  Vietnam's sovereignty"" and would escalate tensions in the region.    Vietnam, apparently in retaliation, also signed up with  Mobil  Oil Corp. to explore an area overlapping the Crestone concession.    The Department of Foreign Affairs [DFA] said that while the  Crestone concession does not fall within the territorial claim  of the Philippines in the South China Sea, it is closely  monitoring developments in the area to review its implications  on regional stability.    ""As defined by Presidential Decree 1596, the Crestone  exploration block is not covered by the Philippines' claim to  the Spratlys. The Crestone block lies some 135 kilometers from  the Western boundary of the Philippine claim,"" a DFA official  said.    But the Philippines reminded China and Vietnam of the 1992  ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea which urged  claimant-states ""to set aside issues of sovereignty and explore  the possibility of cooperation"" in the Spratlys.    The official said the Philippine strategy was to initiate  bilateral talks with other claimants to the Spratlys to promote  the idea of demilitarizing the area and developing the oil-rich  islands through cooperation. The Philippines first proposed the  plan of demilitarizing the area during President Ramos' state  visit to Vietnam.    The Philippines will also continue diplomatic initiatives to  adopt confidence-building measures which will ""veer away from  military confrontation,"" the official said.    The oil-rich Spratlys is being claimed in whole or in part  by  the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Brunei, Taiwan, and Malaysia.     "

Japan presented its plan to the International Whaling Commission's annual conference held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, as an alternative to a French proposal to create a no-hunting zone covering all of Antarctica and stretching halfway to the equator. The French proposal needs the support of three-quarters of the approximately 40 commission member nations attending the five-day meeting if it is to be adopted. Delegates and observers predicted the vote, expected later in the week, would be close. The Japanese plan would eventually allow whalers to capture up to 4,000 minke whales in the seas outside the sanctuary once the commission establishes a scheme to regulate and monitor the hunt. Minke whales have survived in greater numbers than other whales because, although they are larger than elephants, they are smaller than the great whales and were consequently hunted less in previous decades. The whaling commission estimates there are 760,000 minke whales, but it has imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling for the past eight years pending the passage of the so-called Revised Management Plan. Despite the ban, Japanese whalers are permitted by the commission to capture up to 330 minke whales in the Antarctic under a 12-year research programme. The whale meat eventually ends up in Japanese markets, where it fetches Dollars 50 a pound. Norway, which protested against the moratorium, resumed commercial whaling last year and killed more than 200 whales. The current situation frustrates environmental groups and other opponents of the whale hunt as well as whalers, who accuse the whaling commission of taking up animal rights and neglecting its original mandate to regulate whaling. 'Our proposal provides a scientific basis for a sanctuary,' said Mr Kazuo Shima, head of Japan's delegation to the commission. Supporters of the French plan to create a giant whale sanctuary in the Antarctic said on Monday that they had lined up nearly all the votes they needed. 'We're pretty sure of 18 or 19 votes, and another four or five look good,' said Ms Cassandra Phillips, an Antarctic specialist with the environmental organisation, WWF World Wide Fund for Nature. 'On the whole, we're pretty optimistic.' Ms Phillips said around 21 votes would be needed to overcome the votes of seven IWC members expected to oppose the proposal. Environmental groups accuse Japan of buying the votes of its whaling commission allies, mostly poor Caribbean and South Pacific states with no whaling industries, with aid.

The Labour government won a deal with the opposition to allow exploration in the Skagerrak strait, but agreed to make further environmental studies before starting drilling. The opposition Conservative party backed the plan in return for a government promise to review controversial rules allowing the state to raise its stake in profitable oil and gas fields. The new exploration areas will open up 16 per cent more of Norway's continental shelf for prospecting, making it possible to drill under 56 per cent of the waters off the coast. Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer, currently pumps some 2.5m barrels a day, mostly from the North Sea. Output, however, is expected to fall in few years unless new discoveries are made. Sweden, fearing pollution from oil prospecting in the waters between itself, Norway and Denmark, has requested inter-government talks before a decision is made. Norway's state pollution board has sharply criticised previous studies of the consequences of opening Skagerrak and areas off mid-Norway for exploration, calling them inadequate.

Each of the original six members of the 2-year-old film network, consisting of  museum and science centers from around the world, was risking hundreds of  thousands of dollars on ""To the Limit,"" which makes its world debut March 11 at  the Fleet Space Theater.    Nichols, the director of the Museum of Science in Boston, had been instrumental  in bringing the group together -- and keeping it together. They were trying to  do something that had never been done before -- to work as one unit to produce  an extremely expensive, science-oriented film in the big-screen IMAX-OMNIMAX  format.    ""His leadership ability was something quite astonishing to watch,"" Kirsch said.    Nichols sudden death left a pall on the project. The film is dedicated to him.    ""It (Nichols death) was a stunning event for me,"" said Kirsch, who replaced  Nichols as president of the network. ""I said I would do it because I wasn't  going to let Roger down.

""But there was very little in terms of scientific messages.""    Bringing together the museums and science centers was not an easy task. Some  centers experienced in producing films, such as the Science Museum of Minnesota  based in St. Paul, refused to participate.

Deciding on a topic was the first major source of debate. A group was hired to  research OMNIMAX audiences in different cities. The film had to be educational,  but also entertaining enough to attract an audience. Antarctica and a look at  the formation of weather were considered but eventually discarded, although  Antarctica might be used in the future.    ""We want to use the medium to the fullest,"" MacGillivray said. ""We don't want  to present something that can be presented equally as well on TV.""    Nichols brought in the public broadcasting group WGBH-NOVA to serve as  co-executive producer's of the first film.

In exchange,  it will receive a small share of the profits from the film.    ""IMAX films are really a good way to help people understand what science and  technology is all about,"" Apsell said.    Even though NOVA's involvement gave the project instant credibility in the  science community, it also carried a certain mental burden for some members of  the network.    ""It was a two-edged sword,"" Kirsch said. ""We knew with NOVA's involvement it  would be a quality film, but some were afraid it would be too much like a PBS  film.""    In the fall of 1987, the five original members finally signed their names to  contracts, agreeing to pay $225,000 each into the film project, with another  $300,000 in escrow. Detroit was unable to raise the $300,000 and dropped out in  October, eventually replaced by Omniversum from The Hague, Holland.    ""Until that moment everybody was still hedging,"" Kirsch said.    Once the individual museums had approved the script, there were no more  committee reviews.

Mr David Boyd, managing director, said the company would be better off in the short term from the overhaul to the Petroleum Revenue Tax announced in last week's Budget. He said the move would contribute Pounds 5m in additional cash flow from Goal's share in the onshore Wytch Farm development and the Magnus field in the North Sea. However, he said the changes would accelerate plans the company had in place to move its exploration efforts overseas. It is looking at making a further shift from the British to the Netherlands sector of the North Sea. Oil production was steady at 115,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent (which includes gas). It is set to dip slightly this year and almost double in 1995 when offshore production from Wytch Farm comes on stream. Turnover was steady at Pounds 44.2m.

The sanctuary is the main topic of debate at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission, held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and a vote is expected later this week. The Japanese proposal would create a sanctuary for all but minke whales in the Antarctic waters, which could be hunted when and if the current moratorium on whale killings is replaced with a programme of strictly enforced quotas for the number of whales that can be killed. The Japanese plan was dismissed by environmentalists as a cynical ploy, since they say minke whales are the only whales abundant enough in the Antarctic to be of commercial interest. 'The majority of the Commissioners see this for what it is,' said Mr Mike Sutton, vice-president at World Wide Fund For Nature. 'This does not create a sanctuary at all.' The Japanese amendment came as support for a complete ban on whaling covering all of Antarctica appeared to be gaining momentum, with environmentalists confident that they would obtain the necessary three-quarters support of the 40 member countries of the International Whaling Commission. France has proposed that all commercial whaling be prohibited south of 40 degrees latitude. Chile has offered an amendment that would reduce the size of the sanctuary so it would not infringe its own waters. The Chile amendment accepts almost all of the sanctuary proposed by France and appears acceptable to many member countries. Commercial whaling is currently prohibited under an eight-year moratorium, although it is violated by Norway. The Japanese and Norwegians believe the moratorium should be replaced by quotas, set so as not to endanger population levels of whale species. The Japanese and Norwegians are generally supported by some Caribbean countries and south Pacific states. The US is expected to submit a resolution that would expressly prohibit individual countries using sustainable quotas calculated by the Scientific Committee of the Whaling Commission to justify unilateral hunting. The US and other member countries say the quotas should only be adopted when a comprehensive programme is in place that permits observation and inspection of whale hunters. Some environmentalists are concerned that the information on which quotas are calculated may be faulty. Earlier this year it was reported that the former Soviet Union had under-reported the amount of whales it killed. The scientific committee of the whaling commission said its models can cope with misreporting of catches of up to 50 per cent each year. It said that if misreporting was greater than 50 per cent further trials would be necessary.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

Ms Albina Africano, the country's energy minister, said western oil companies were preparing to invest more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in oil exploration. The country was plunged back into civil war after election results which returned President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his MPLA government to power were rejected by the rebel movement Unita. In May Unita captured the oil town of Soyo where they destroyed oil storage facilities and halted onshore oil production. 'They've completely destroyed Soyo, everything has been blown up,' Ms Africano said. Onshore oil output of 30,000 barrels a day (b/d) has been stopped since January and some offshore production has been suspended because of the destruction of Soyo's storage terminal. Ms Africano in London for meetings with the British government in an effort to persuade ministers to put pressure on Unita to return to the negotiating table, said 60,000 b/d of offshore output had been halted, but she was confident that this could be resumed within months, if storage facilities offshore could be expanded. Angola is producing 453,000 b/d compared with capacity production of 550,000 b/d. The rebels have shot at the oil platforms 70km offshore, but Ms Africano said the western oil companies have been given military guarantees they will be protected as effectively as possible. 'The situation is more stable than it appears, the future investment plans of the oil companies show they still have confidence in the country,' she said. Chevron, Angola's largest operator is investing Dollars 500m in development of oilfields in Cabinda, and Elf, the French energy company, plans to put Dollars 1bn into expanding its own production. Ms Africano said the government hoped to sign a contract by September, giving Exxon, the US oil major, and British Petroleum deep-water exploration acreage. Exxon will be the operator on the 4,500-square km block with BP holding 40 per cent of the interest and Agip, Italy's resources company, having a minority interest. Royal Dutch/Shell has recently been awarded another deep water block and Ms Africano said a group of companies led by Chevron and including Total and Agip would be awarded another deep-water block in August. The Angolan government is looking for the country's oil production to increase to 690,000 b/d by 1997, excluding the new deep-water blocks.   Countries:-  AOZ  Angola, Africa.

The surprise action, introduced by Sen. James A. McClure (R-Idaho), appeared to  be intended to put an end to the moratorium process that has put California off  limits to offshore oil drilling for a decade and stirred the rancor of senators  who favor exploration for oil.    The economic impact of a port shutdown on cities such as Long Beach would be so  catastrophic that opponents of offshore drilling would have little choice but  to stop barring new oil exploration by congressional mandate, supporters and  critics said.    Approval of the port-closing measure, which was attached to an Interior  Department funding bill on a 12-10 vote, appeared likely to at least force  Congress to limit the scope of a sweeping one-year offshore drilling moratorium  recently approved by the House.    The moratorium, which was accepted reluctantly by the Senate panel as part of  the appropriations bill, bars new oil exploration within 84 million acres of  American coastline, including the entire length of California, through October,  1990.      Acknowledge Dilemma    Even staunch drilling advocates acknowledged that public concern about oil  spills, particularly the Exxon Valdez disaster off the Alaskan coast, had made  it impossible to vote against a moratorium.    Rather than oppose a moratorium outright, they sought to turn that public  concern to their advantage, arguing that any coastal waters too sensitive to be  exposed to drilling ought also to be protected from more hazardous oil tanker  traffic.    ""If an area is really sensitive,"" said Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), ""let's  close it.""    The amendment would bar oil-carrying tankers from entering any U.S. waters in  which oil exploration was prohibited beginning in October, 1991.    Passage of the amended measure prompted cries of outrage from drilling critics,  who denounced the port closing provision as ""mischievous"" and ""irresponsible.""    ""This is a distortion,"" said California Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey),  sponsor of earlier bills that have put most of California off limits to  drilling since 1981. ""They're saying: 'If you don't like drilling, we'll take  your tankers away.' ""     ""It's sort of like planting a time bomb,"" said Lisa Speer, an attorney for the  Natural Resources Defense Council. ""It's a ploy to pressure the states that  have moratoriums to drop them.""    But other environmentalists acknowledged that the port-closing measure puts  them in a difficult position because it appears to echo their own concerns  about the risks that oil exploration poses to environmentally sensitive  regions.    And many expressed concern that, if enacted by the Senate, the threat could be  used as a negotiating chip to force the House to abandon a provision that would  prevent the Interior Department from conducting even preliminary drilling  studies off California.    The Interior Department, which opposes the drilling moratorium but had not  expected to block it altogether, had made elimination of the ban on preleasing  activity a top priority. The provision affords special protection to a vast  area off Central California, where progress toward a scheduled 1991 lease sale  otherwise would go unhindered.    In a victory for the Administration, the Senate panel agreed to delete the  preleasing activity ban from the legislation on grounds that it would block  crucial studies designed to assess whether drilling might pose an environmental  threat.    While the committee approved the rest of the drilling moratorium, it voiced  strong reservations, criticizing what it described as ""ineffective"" efforts by  the House to address public concerns.    ""I understand emotions,"" warned Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), an outspoken  supporter of the oil industry, ""but we're not supposed to be tossed along on  the frothy sea of emotion. We're supposed to deal with facts.""    Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.), an advocate of the moratorium, urged his  colleagues to be patient in large part because ""the nation is recoiling from  oil spills.""    Despite the misgivings on the part of the committee, champions of the drilling  ban expressed confidence that they could win approval of a comprehensive  moratorium when the measure reaches the Senate floor. A vote could come as  early as today.      Unexpected Twist    ""The committee approval of the leasing moratorium is an important victory in  our battle to protect the California coast from oil and gas development,"" said  Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). As for the moratorium on preleasing activity,  Cranston said: ""I expect we will prevail.""    The introduction by McClure of the port-closing provision added an unexpected  twist to what had been a straightforward battle between pro-exploration and  anti-drilling forces.    Many observers interpreted the provision as a deliberate effort by the Senate  committee to ""tweak"" California, which has wielded its legislative power in the  House to protect itself from new offshore drilling while profiting enormously  from the oil industry.    ""I think what you're witnessing is a regional dispute,"" said Steve Goldstein,  an Interior Department official. ""California's predominance in the House has  tended to bring about a rather parochial point of view.""    Administration officials praised the McClure measure for focusing attention on  the fact that tankers have proven more likely to cause oil spills than have  offshore drilling platforms.

A stronger reaction came from the oil industry, which contended that the  measure might block its product from American markets if ports were indeed  closed.

BUT THERE ARE SOME BRIGHT SPOTS.      By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The oil industry is entering the last decade of the century with the muck of  the 1980s still stuck to its boots like oil from the Exxon Valdez.    The legacy of the Valdez will haunt oil companies in California and elsewhere  that are just emerging from a period of major restructuring accelerated by the  collapse of oil prices in 1986.    During that time, major oil companies pared exploration and production staffs,  closed unprofitable refining operations and improved efficiencies at others,  and shifted emphasis from domestic to foreign oil prospecting as home-grown  sources dwindled.    Now, post-Valdez environmental concerns stand in the way of renewed domestic  oil and gas exploration, and proposed clean air rules threaten to transform the  industry's gasoline refining business forever.    In California, where environmental regulations are strictest, environmental and  financial obstacles to new refinery building are already making existing plants  among the most desirable in the industry -- and this in a place where gasoline  demand is expected to grow the fastest.    The last gasps of the industry's restructuring can be seen in recent industry  developments:    California companies such as Unocal Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp., as  well as Mobil Oil Corp. and British Petroleum, have announced reorganization of  exploration and production units, including some staff cuts.    ""I think the layoffs are reflecting the real end of the depression in the  upstream (exploration and production) side of the industry,"" said Edward Morse,  executive publisher of industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly.    Several refinery operations have gone on the block recently, many in  California. Southland Corp. said last week that it would sell its remaining  half-interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp., which operates a refinery in Northern  California, to the Venezuelan state-owned oil company for $675 million. Santa  Monica-based Tosco Corp., the West Coast's largest independent refiner, said  last week that it was entertaining offers from at least three multinational  companies for its business. And Unocal is about to close its own deal with the  Venezuelans, a joint venture to operate Unocal's Chicago refinery that would  bring Unocal more than $500 million.    ""I think there's a recognition that this is a good market here,"" said Thomas K.  Nance, Tosco's treasurer. ""The supply-demand balance appears to be very tight,  and the expectation is that the market will only get better.""    The desirability of California refineries contrasts with refining in other  parts of the country. Unocal said last week that it would cease all refinery  production at its 65-year-old Beaumont plant in Nederland, Tex., which makes  lube oil, aromatics and solvents.    ""It was very out of date for the marketplace. . . . And with the margins as  they are, you just can't compete,"" said Unocal spokesman Barry Lane. The Gulf  Coast region's refining profit margins rank last behind those of three other  regions of the country, according to a report by Drexel Burnham Lambert. The  West Coast has the strongest.    In the country as a whole, the restructuring period has resulted in a sharp  drop in domestic oil and gas production.    ""This is really the second round in the long trend of downsizing in the  exploration and production business that started in '84 or '85,"" said Phillip  Ellis, a vice president with Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc. ""The idea behind  it was that the U.S. resource base has the highest cost in the world. . . .  There's a lot of oil and gas left here, but very few elephants,"" meaning fields  large enough to reward oil company development.    In 1990, crude oil production will see the sharpest decline since the 1970s,  according to a forecast by the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America.  Production dropped 460,000 barrels per day in 1989 over a year earlier, and is  expected to fall an additional 329,000 barrels per day to 7.4 million in 1990.  Natural gas production remained level in 1989 at 16.6 trillion cubic feet.    The budget for domestic exploration and production, which accounted for about  75% to 78% of total E&P budgets, now constitutes less than half, Morse  said. Amoco Corp., traditionally one of the first companies to announce its  annual exploration budget, says that for the first time in its history, more  than half of its budget will be spent outside the United States in 1990.    ""When today's oil executives calculate and form their strategies for the  future, they confront the fact that U.S. oil production is not likely to occupy  the cornerstone of their operations,"" said Dillard P. Spriggs, president of  Petroleum Analysis Ltd., in a speech at Johns Hopkins University this fall.    But there are some signs that interest in domestic oil and gas exploration is  picking up as prices stabilize, although no one expects such activity to ever  match pre-collapse levels. ""From almost every perspective, there are signs that  (exploration and production) operations are increasing, mostly outside the  U.S., but in the U.S. as well,"" Morse said.    The prime indicator of new drilling activity -- the rig count -- has been  climbing steadily in the past few months, according to Baker Hughes Inc., the  oil services firm. As of Nov. 6, the number of rotary drilling rigs in use rose  to 1,042. That's still well below the peak level of 4,530 or so in 1981, but is  nevertheless the highest level since the winter of 1988. For the year, the rig  count remains below 1988 levels.    Natural gas appears the most promising, especially if clean air regulations  spur demand and the current oversupply diminishes as hoped. Amoco has made  natural gas development a prime goal of its domestic operations. It became the  largest owner of U.S. natural gas reserves with the acquisition last year of  Canada's Dome Petroleum and part of the Tenneco reserves.    On the refining side, analysts agree that most of the weaker operations have  been weeded out, and improvements have raised operating rates to their highest  levels ever as demand remains relatively strong and profit margins remain  generally good.    Refining capacity is so tight now that prices spike sharply at any disruptions,  such as Hurricane Hugo's destruction to Caribbean refineries or last month's  explosion at a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics refinery in Texas. And some  observers fear that the high rates of utilization make such disruptions all the  more likely.    All of which is placing a premium on refinery assets, particularly on the West  Coast, where refining margins are highest. Environmental regulations make it  hugely expensive, if not altogether impossible, to build a new plant in  California.    Tight capacity has also renewed interest in other refining assets. Last month,  Coastal Corp. said it would reactivate the closed Exxon plant in Aruba in the  Caribbean.    A number of things keep analysts from being overly optimistic about a strong  rebound in the oil industry's fortunes:    Independent producers still await federal action to return tax benefits lost  during the rewrite of federal tax laws.    Continued oversupply of natural gas could keep prices soft and discourage new  domestic production.    Environmental pressures could keep drilling out of promising areas. A  continuation of moratoriums on offshore drilling could put outer continental  shelf areas off limits to production indefinitely, and post-Valdez concerns  will probably keep exploration out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.    A downturn in the economy could mean the loss of refining profits at a time  when many will face upgrades to make cleaner gasolines or alternative fuels.    Looming over everything is uncertainty about where oil prices may go. Most  analysts expect prices to continue at their current levels through the year.  Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet later  this month to discuss their nations' production levels and other matters.

BUT THERE ARE SOME BRIGHT SPOTS.      By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The oil industry is entering the last decade of the century with the muck of  the 1980s still stuck to its boots like oil from the Exxon Valdez.    The legacy of the Valdez will haunt oil companies in California and elsewhere  that are just emerging from a period of major restructuring accelerated by the  collapse of oil prices in 1986.    During that time, major oil companies pared exploration and production staffs,  closed unprofitable refining operations and improved efficiencies at others,  and shifted emphasis from domestic to foreign oil prospecting as home-grown  sources dwindled.    Now, post-Valdez environmental concerns stand in the way of renewed domestic  oil and gas exploration, and proposed clean air rules threaten to transform the  industry's gasoline refining business forever.    In California, where environmental regulations are strictest, environmental and  financial obstacles to new refinery building are already making existing plants  among the most desirable in the industry -- and this in a place where gasoline  demand is expected to grow the fastest.    The last gasps of the industry's restructuring can be seen in recent industry  developments:    California companies such as Unocal Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp., as  well as Mobil Oil Corp. and British Petroleum, have announced reorganization of  exploration and production units, including some staff cuts.    ""I think the layoffs are reflecting the real end of the depression in the  upstream (exploration and production) side of the industry,"" said Edward Morse,  executive publisher of industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly.    Several refinery operations have gone on the block recently, many in  California. Southland Corp. said last week that it would sell its remaining  half-interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp., which operates a refinery in Northern  California, to the Venezuelan state-owned oil company for $675 million. Santa  Monica-based Tosco Corp., the West Coast's largest independent refiner, said  last week that it was entertaining offers from at least three multinational  companies for its business. And Unocal is about to close its own deal with the  Venezuelans, a joint venture to operate Unocal's Chicago refinery that would  bring Unocal more than $500 million.    ""I think there's a recognition that this is a good market here,"" said Thomas K.  Nance, Tosco's treasurer. ""The supply-demand balance appears to be very tight,  and the expectation is that the market will only get better.""    The desirability of California refineries contrasts with refining in other  parts of the country. Unocal said last week that it would cease all refinery  production at its 65-year-old Beaumont plant in Nederland, Tex., which makes  lube oil, aromatics and solvents.    ""It was very out of date for the marketplace. . . . And with the margins as  they are, you just can't compete,"" said Unocal spokesman Barry Lane. The Gulf  Coast region's refining profit margins rank last behind those of three other  regions of the country, according to a report by Drexel Burnham Lambert. The  West Coast has the strongest.    In the country as a whole, the restructuring period has resulted in a sharp  drop in domestic oil and gas production.    ""This is really the second round in the long trend of downsizing in the  exploration and production business that started in '84 or '85,"" said Phillip  Ellis, a vice president with Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc. ""The idea behind  it was that the U.S. resource base has the highest cost in the world. . . .  There's a lot of oil and gas left here, but very few elephants,"" meaning fields  large enough to reward oil company development.    In 1990, crude oil production will see the sharpest decline since the 1970s,  according to a forecast by the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America.  Production dropped 460,000 barrels per day in 1989 over a year earlier, and is  expected to fall an additional 329,000 barrels per day to 7.4 million in 1990.  Natural gas production remained level in 1989 at 16.6 trillion cubic feet.    The budget for domestic exploration and production, which accounted for about  75% to 78% of total E&P budgets, now constitutes less than half, Morse  said. Amoco Corp., traditionally one of the first companies to announce its  annual exploration budget, says that for the first time in its history, more  than half of its budget will be spent outside the United States in 1990.    ""When today's oil executives calculate and form their strategies for the  future, they confront the fact that U.S. oil production is not likely to occupy  the cornerstone of their operations,"" said Dillard P. Spriggs, president of  Petroleum Analysis Ltd., in a speech at Johns Hopkins University this fall.    But there are some signs that interest in domestic oil and gas exploration is  picking up as prices stabilize, although no one expects such activity to ever  match pre-collapse levels. ""From almost every perspective, there are signs that  (exploration and production) operations are increasing, mostly outside the  U.S., but in the U.S. as well,"" Morse said.    The prime indicator of new drilling activity -- the rig count -- has been  climbing steadily in the past few months, according to Baker Hughes Inc., the  oil services firm. As of Nov. 6, the number of rotary drilling rigs in use rose  to 1,042. That's still well below the peak level of 4,530 or so in 1981, but is  nevertheless the highest level since the winter of 1988. For the year, the rig  count remains below 1988 levels.    Natural gas appears the most promising, especially if clean air regulations  spur demand and the current oversupply diminishes as hoped. Amoco has made  natural gas development a prime goal of its domestic operations. It became the  largest owner of U.S. natural gas reserves with the acquisition last year of  Canada's Dome Petroleum and part of the Tenneco reserves.    On the refining side, analysts agree that most of the weaker operations have  been weeded out, and improvements have raised operating rates to their highest  levels ever as demand remains relatively strong and profit margins remain  generally good.    Refining capacity is so tight now that prices spike sharply at any disruptions,  such as Hurricane Hugo's destruction to Caribbean refineries or last month's  explosion at a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics refinery in Texas. And some  observers fear that the high rates of utilization make such disruptions all the  more likely.    All of which is placing a premium on refinery assets, particularly on the West  Coast, where refining margins are highest. Environmental regulations make it  hugely expensive, if not altogether impossible, to build a new plant in  California.    Tight capacity has also renewed interest in other refining assets. Last month,  Coastal Corp. said it would reactivate the closed Exxon plant in Aruba in the  Caribbean.    A number of things keep analysts from being overly optimistic about a strong  rebound in the oil industry's fortunes:    Independent producers still await federal action to return tax benefits lost  during the rewrite of federal tax laws.

0,FT931-6255 ,"FT931-6255 _AN-DCBCFAGBFT 930302   FT  02 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru re-awards oil field contract      By SALLY BOWEN      LIMA   PETROTECH International Corporation has won the new contract to operate the Petromar oil field off the northern Peruvian coast. The concession, formerly held by Belco, was taken over by the state after a 1985 contractual dispute. Settlement of an insurance claim by American International Group is still outstanding. Petrotech, registered in Delaware, is part of the New York McAllister Brothers group. Its current operations focus on Venezuela and the Gulf of Mexico. Through a subsidiary, International Marine, it has maintained a presence in Peru for ten years, servicing the Petromar offshore field. Two other international companies - Hallwood Petroleum of the US and Compania Naviera Perez Companc of Argentina - pre-qualified to bid. Petrotech will take an average of almost 79 per cent of all crude produced, leaving 21 per cent for Petroperu, the state-run petroleum giant. The concession for the 400-hectare lot Z-2B will run for ten years with an option to renew for a further ten. Output from the field has slumped since the Belco days, from a peak of 30,000 barrels a day to an all-time low last year of less than half that. In recent months, despite a dearth of equipment and spare parts, output has risen to 17,000 b/d. The concession is an important step in the planned privatisation of Petroperu. According to Mr Jaime Quijandria, the company's president, 'the most attractive part of the field lies in the 50 per cent still unexplored. And while that exploration goes ahead, the new operating company will be earning cash from the half that's already working'. Contract terms require Petrotech to drill at least 40 development wells over the next three years and five exploration wells by the year 2000. Petrotech officials estimated drilling costs at Dollars 80m and Dollars 20m respectively. The operator will also pay Petroperu Dollars 10m a year for the lease of existing assets. Another Dollars 30m to Dollars 60m will have to be spent on repairs and modernisation. Meanwhile, other advances were made in the transformation Petroperu. Three weeks ago, New York-based Booz, Allen and Hamilton was contracted to advise the Peruvian government on an overall privatisation strategy for the oil sector. And ten days ago Great Western Resources, through its Peruvian affiliate, signed an exploration agreement with Petroperu for Block 65 in the Maranon basin. It is the company's first ever venture outside the US. The Belco insurance claim remains unresolved. While AIG tacitly agreed to the re-leasing of the ex-Belco field, sources said that the dispute, involving Dollars 185m in compensation and already recognised by the Fujimori government, had by no means been dropped.

The well, which is operated by Anadarko of the US, Lasmo's partner in the venture along with Maersk of Denmark, was tested at 4,900 barrels of oil a day and 6.3m cu ft of natural gas. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said the partners were considering an early appraisal of the find. 'The prospects for a commercial discovery are quite good,' he said. Last year Lasmo and its partners announced an oil and gas find south of the latest discovery. Two more exploration wells are to be drilled in the area, which is in a relatively remote area south-east of the town of Hassi Messaoud. The discovery is about 50km from the nearest pipeline. Oil operations in the region have so far been untouched by the political violence directed against foreigners in Algiers, although American drilling crews are flown to the site directly from Texas.

0,FT942-10037 ,"FT942-10037 _AN-EELCZAE5FT 940512   FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bigger is not necessarily better - Enterprise's bid for Lasmo      By ROBERT CORZINE and PEGGY HOLLINGER   When Mr Graham Hearne, chief executive of Enterprise Oil, justified his hostile bid for fellow explorer Lasmo by describing oil exploration as a big boys game which required critical mass, he triggered off a chorus of criticism. Analysts accused him of seeking size for its own sake, and pointed to the many big discoveries made by small oil companies. Many industry executives said what mattered most was the way in which companies handled their existing assets. However Mr Hearne's comments have brought to the surface an issue which bedevils an industry in which corporate minnows co-exist alongside the big integrated majors. 'There is a very great debate on whether size is an important issue,' said Mr David Simon, chief executive of British Petroleum. Mr Hearne said he never intended to convey the impression that Enterprise was interested in size for its own sake. But he stands by the argument that critical mass makes good industrial sense and that Enterprise, the largest UK independent, needs to be of a 'size we feel necessary to deliver shareholder value'. Lasmo's defence document rebutting this argument has to be published by Monday but it is widely expected to be out before the weekend. The size argument has not found many supporters among Mr Hearne's industry colleagues. 'I think that aspect of Enterprise's argument is total rubbish,' said one executive. 'There have always been niches for different sizes of players and different skills.' Many in the industry believe the proposed deal is driven more by financial issues than industrial logic. They point out that neither company operates many of their main projects, so there is little scope for greater production efficiency. The commercial argument, that cash-rich Enterprise is short of medium-term development prospects while cash-strapped Lasmo may not be able to fund all its potential projects, is somewhat stronger, according to analysts. They note that revenues from Lasmo developments such as the Liverpool Bay gas project would smooth out an expected dip in Enterprise's production and cash flow later this decade as output falls from the Nelson and Scott fields. Many industry observers believe, however, that Enterprise's need to keep growing its dividend is one of the most compelling reasons for the deal. Smaller independents are relieved of that pressure. They have always been seen as North Sea-based capital growth stocks, the price of which could soar on the back of just one strike. Enterprise, however, is 'too large to be regarded as an asset play,' said one independent executive. He added that it was judged more on its dividend paying capacity in much the same way as an integrated oil major. In fact, a combined Lasmo and Enterprise would rival in size the exploration and production arms of some of the integrated oil majors but without the benefits of being a diversified group with downstream activities. 'There is a lot of pressure to pay dividends, and investors want it to go up each year,' the head of a rival independent company said. But to carry on paying, companies need to find oil fields, either through exploration or acquisition, or have the support of diversified downstream operations. Some in the industry feel that Mr Hearne has compounded his problems by choosing to focus on upstream exploration and production. 'Most other large companies have some sort of vertical integration so they can ride out the storms of the oil price by making money at the petrol pump,' said the managing director of a UK independent. Some analysts also argue that Enterprise could have realised its upstream ambitions by simply buying packages of assets, thus avoiding a costly takeover battle. Completed asset disposals in the UK North Sea alone have totalled Dollars 1bn since the beginning of 1993, according to analysts at Kleinwort Benson, and brokers say there is no shortage of assets for sale. Buying packages of assets might have been more warmly greeted in the City, but it would also have taken Enterprise much longer to achieve a similar spread of business. In addition Enterprise says the Lasmo portfolio fits particularly well with its own. Many in the industry understand the pressures which have forced the hostile bid. Yet they still question the wisdom of a move which would force a whole new range of problems, such as the fact that big oil companies need to make big discoveries. The chances of making discoveries adequate to replenish reserves fall dramatically as the companies get bigger, as the graph shows. 'Lasmo might make Enterprise a stronger company . . . but it does not answer the fundamental question of what to do afterwards. The challenge to replace such large reserves with reserves of equal quality is an even greater one,' said one sceptical executive. The only way off the dividend treadmill is to shrink the company by selling assets. 'Every oil exploration company has to shrink at times,' says one executive. Companies such as Exxon and BP have succeeded in downsizing, but the task of persuading shareholders that such a move can be in their interests is not easy, he added. 'Investors don't understand downsizing, even though the only time you make money is when you sell.'   Companies:-  Enterprise Oil.     Lasmo.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

On this issue, our radio editor has this to say:    In recent days, many activities have been taken by a number  of countries which have complicated the situation in the Truong  Sa [Spratly] Archipelago and on Vietnam's continental shelf.    Despite the Vietnamese Government's statements on its  continental shelf and special economic zone, the Creston Company  of the United States on 8 May 1992 signed an agreement on oil  and gas exploration with a Chinese company in an area they  called Wananbei-21, which is in fact the Tu Chinh area of  Vietnam. The Vietnamese Government immediately voiced its  protest, considering the move a violation of Vietnam's  sovereignty, but it ignored Vietnam's statement. On 18 April  1994, Creston again announced a seismic survey in the area.  Foreign reports on 10 May quoted a spokesman for the Chinese  Foreign Ministry saying that the Thanh Long Sea area belongs to  the adjacent waters of Nansha Island, which is in fact Vietnam's  Truong Sa Archipelago. He even said that the exploration  contract signed between Vietnam and the Mobil Oil Company was  illegal.    On the question of Truong Sa and Tu Chinh, the Vietnamese  Government has many times affirmed that they are under Vietnam's  sovereignty. At a press conference in Hanoi on 5 May, a  spokesperson of the Vietnam Foreign Ministry said: Vietnam has  enough historical and legal documents proving its sovereignty  over Truong Sa Archipelago. Therefore, foreign activities of  exploration and exploitation of natural resources of Truong Sa  area without the permit of Vietnam are acts of violation of its  sovereignty.    On the settlement of disputes, Vietnam has on many occasions  stated that disputes should be settled in the spirit of  equality, mutual understanding, and mutual respect in accordance  with international law and the Convention on the Maritime Law of  1982, and in respect of the sovereignty of all countries over  exclusive economic zones and continental shelves. All parties  concerned should restrain themselves not to further complicate  the situation, use violence, or threat to use violence. Vietnam  is persistent on this line. As for Tu Chinh, Vietnam affirms  that it lies within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and  continental shelf, entirely under Vietnam's sovereignty.  Vietnam has the sovereign right to explore for and exploit  natural resources in this area by itself or in cooperation with  other foreign countries, the right which no other country may  interfere. Tu Chinh and Thanh Long are in no way related to the  Truong Sa Archipelago or the adjacent waters. Any statement or  any contrary act to these principles is illegal and runs counter  to the international law.     "

Senior Falklands government officials have been told by the Foreign Office that further steps towards developing an oil industry in the area  - such as full-scale exploration  - must await agreement between London and Buenos Aires. However, this initial move, coinciding with the tenth anniversary today of the Argentine invasion of the Falklands, could provoke a strong protest from Argentina, which has been pressing for joint participation with the UK on every stage of the Falklands' oil programme. Its timing also appears to have pre-empted the outcome of the UK general election, which Falkland Islanders fear may lead to a Labour victory and a more conciliatory attitude towards Buenos Aires on the issue of sovereignty. Surprised foreign ministry officials in Buenos Aires said they had been reassured by the UK there would be no unilateral move on oil. Argentina wants to participate in the seismic studies, which it considers important in establishing the true economic potential of the area. Argentina, which does not recognise the islands' government, claims sovereignty over the surrounding waters. But the Foreign Office in London said that the Falklands government could, under local legislation, exercise rights over the seabed and the subsoil of the continental shelf around the islands. There is widespread speculation in the Falklands and in Buenos Aires that the islands have large oil reserves. A study of their oil potential by a private company in the 1970s has remained a closely guarded secret. Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive of the islands' council, said there was no reason why the Falkland Islands could not go ahead with the studies. He expected seismic studies to be completed by the end of this year and to be in a position to licence blocks for exploration by the middle of 1993. Mr Sampson said local councillors had been 'made aware by the British government' that in the 'longer term there will have to be a much closer co-operation with Argentina in the exploration of oil'. UK-Argentine talks in Buenos Aires in February about oil were inconclusive, but further negotiations are planned for in London in June. The Foreign Office said last night that, given the 'sensitivity' of the oil issue, London and Buenos Aires were remaining in constant contact with each other.  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "

The state company's own operator, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company has found nine hydrocarbons levels at the Oziengbe south field, five km from Koko in Delta state, in one of the few onshore concessions that is 100 per cent owned by NPDC. The find takes NPDC's proven reserves to 169m barrels. The company has one small oil field in production at Apura, a joint venture with British Gas, but the rest of Nigeria's 1.8m barrels daily quota is produced by NNPC's minority joint venture partners who are all international oil companies, except Dubri Oil, the only indigenous private sector producer in Africa. The Nigerian government last year signed a series of exploration and production contracts for deep water concessions that shifted all the initial costs of developing fields to the oil majors as part of its drive to increase proven oil reserves from 20bn to 25bn barrels by the end of the decade.

Colombia, as the newspaper EL ESPECTADOR reports in today's  Salmon Section, is going to go all the way to attract new  investors by means of more attractive contracts to build a sound  future as far as exploration and exploitation of oil goes.    We have ECOPETROL President Juan Maria Rendon on the line.  Good morning, Dr. Rendon.    [Rendon] Hello, Dario, how are you?    [Arizmendi] What do you and ECOPETROL expect from this probe  being initiated today?    [Rendon] The main objective is to attract new investors to  the country so that they can help Colombia get into this oil  business, which is characterized by high risks and heavy  investments. Colombia suitably decided 20 years ago to work on  this in conjunction with the private sector. Unfortunately, low  oil prices and the fact that China, Russia, and many others have  opened up to foreign investments like Colombia did appropriately  a long time ago makes it more difficult to find companies that  want to come here for exploration. The main objective is to  engage in a very aggressive campaign in the cities you mentioned  to visit the headquarters of the companies with our information  to secure oil production levels Cusiana will make possible.    [Arizmendi] How many foreign companies are expected to join  the exploration process?    [Rendon] We do not have any fixed estimate, but we hope that  10 or 15 new companies come to the country.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Rendon, After this initial process that  covers the three big regions we just mentioned -- the Pie de  Monte of Los Llanos, Magdalena's Valle Superior, and Tupumayo --  will information be prepared on other regions of the country for  similar exploration activities?    [Rendon] This year we will work on this process only,  basically. We are going to wait for results. Possibly next  year we will work on a new bid.    [Arizmendi] Current contract conditions are attractive  enough  to compete with nations like China and Russia?    [Rendon] These countries we have mentioned, plus Argentina,  Peru, and others, are working on this under very special  conditions because previously they had not considered foreign  investment to develop the oil industry. The state was doing  that. Now they have come to the foreign investment arena in a  very hearty way. Their conditions are special, and it will be  difficult for Colombia to match them. We have produced  conditions we think are attractive. They are based on the  country's economic stability and on the respect we always show  to companies, plus the fact that this country is attractive  because of the Cusiana oil breakthrough which we think will be  successful.    [Arizmendi] Much has been said about Cusiana and (Cucuagua).  The country has to start thinking about what will happen after  the year 2000. Exploration activities have dropped, probably  because of high exploration and exploitation costs and because  we are not being sufficiently competitive with other countries  such as China and Russia, as you have noted. What other factors  could exist with regard to Colombia's loss of competitive clout  with foreign investors?    [Rendon] Companies go to countries that offer revenue  possibilities and respect for the rules of the game. These are  two factors on which we want to make emphasis. We have also  changed our attitude, from one that consisted of passively  waiting for the companies to come here, to a more businesslike  attitude of preparing reports on Colombia's potential to present  them at formal bidding sessions, like the ones we have prepared.  We will elect the winner after a public bidding that will  consider investment factors [words indistinct] in the country.    [Arizmendi] Will this international bidding include the  potential oil zones of Medina and Cundinamarca?    [Rendon] No. Those are reserve areas that have a high  potential and that ECOPETROL maintains for itself to develop in  the future. This is an area near Cusiana. We are looking for  ways of working on those fields by somehow forming an  association with a company willing to share risks and manage  investments. Oil wells there will cost $30 million each. That  is a very complex area. The budget for that operation could be  a bit difficult.    [Arizmendi] If foreign investment is necessary, why have we  renounced the support of Shell in Huila Department, as it has  just happened?    [Rendon] This is a legal matter more than anything else.  What happens with this company is that there is this contract,  signed over 30 years ago. It is based on outdated  circumstances, when the state [words indistinct] intervention.  Later Colombia went modern, and now foreigners and ECOPETROL  are partners and manage things jointly. After 30 years the  contract is over, and there has been a legal ruling. Shell  believes it can extend the contract. The State Council has said  no. In view of this, the government has decided that it cannot  extend the contract. It is not that we want them to leave.  Shell is one of the most important companies in the world. We  would like them to be in Colombia, with an even larger presence.  I hope we can understand each other. This is not a matter of  attitudes or of lack of compliance, but a legal matter.     "
0,FT932-11842 ,"FT932-11842 _AN-DD3B1AG2FT 930430   FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Albania offers onshore exploration blocks      By KERIN HOPE      TIRANA   ALBANIA IS extending its oil and natural gas exploration programme to onshore areas, offering concessions in six blocks covering 700 square km along the country's Adriatic coastline. In a separate project, international oil companies are being invited to submit bids for a Dollars 70m recovery enhancement programme at existing oilfields in southern Albania. The offers mark a reversal of previous Albanian policy on oil exploration, which restricted foreign companies to offshore drilling. The government is now trying to attract large-scale investment from abroad to help modernise the country's crumbling industrial base. Following completion of seismic testing last year, five international oil companies are due to start offshore drilling in the Adriatic this summer. However, there have been considerable administrative delays caused by uncertainty over Albania's legal framework for investment. Mr Albert Isai of Albpetrol, the state oil company, said that the tender offer for onshore concessions was prepared in partnership with Western Geophysical, the US-based surveying company, which re-processed data provided by Albanian geologists. He said seven international companies had so far shown interest in onshore exploration. Bids are due by June 15. The onshore contracts, expected to have a 25-year duration, foresee a five-year research and exploration period, with on-site training to be provided for Albanian technical staff. Under a production-sharing agreement, capital expenditures would be recovered over five years. Up to 40 per cent of yearly crude oil production would be payable for cost recovery, while profit sharing would be negotiable, Mr Isai said. Natural gas discoveries would remain the property of the Albanian state. The government hopes that Albania will be linked with a planned gas pipeline from Skopje in Macedonia and another under construction in northern Greece. Both would supply Russian natural gas. The recovery enhancement project covers oilfields at Divjaka, Povelca and Ballaj where total production of crude has declined to around 800,000 tonnes a year from more than 2m tonnes a year in the late 1970s. Albpetrol invited bids in the form of joint ventures, production sharing or service contracts, specifying that local staff and services should be used wherever possible. The three-year project would probably involve new drilling 'for exploitation not exploration' and use of new technology, such as steam injection techniques, to increase oil yields, Mr Isai said. 'Production has been steadily declining. We are using antiquated Russian, Chinese and Romanian equipment, and there are no spare parts,' he said. The project also calls for spending Dollars 5m for environmental improvement, mainly on a clean-up of contaminated land and streams around the oilfields. Negotiations are under way with several international companies, including Mol of Hungary, and two US-based companies, Transmark and Anglo-Suisse, with contracts due to be signed this summer, Mr Isai said.

The turnround, which compared with a loss of Pounds 4.8m last time, was struck on sales 86 per cent higher at Pounds 5.4m. The improvement was largely due to the acquisition of producing assets from Monument Oil  Gas in the second half. Brabant said it had increased average net oil production during the year by 52 per cent to 1,786 barrels per day. The Monument acquisition had left it well placed to fund future exploration, the company said. Brabant could 'rely on internally generated funds to support its exploration and development programme for the foreseeable future'. Mr Malcolm Butler, managing director, said the group could now begin exploring its own prospects, as opposed to ones dictated by obligations such as those arising through acquisitions. A substantial drilling programme, to be funded through cash flow, was planned for 1994. It was unlikely that the company would seek investment from shareholders for this programme. Any payment of a dividend would depend on exploration success - as in previous years there is again no pay-out.   Companies:-  Brabant Resources.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Unocal said it would increase its 1990 North American development drilling  budget by 12%, or $33 million, to drill 93 new development oil wells in the  United States and Canada that were originally scheduled to be drilled in 1991.    With the announcement, Los Angeles-based Unocal joins companies such as Conoco  Inc. and Chevron Corp., who earlier announced plans to speed up some drilling  to take advantage of a windfall resulting from higher oil prices.    But analysts said the projects do not signal a widespread increase in U.S. oil  drilling activity as a result of the Middle East crisis. That's mainly because  most oil executives are reluctant to change long-term spending plans based on  what is perceived as a momentary run-up of crude prices.    ""It's the anticipation of prices that focuses exploration (planning),"" said  Robert Megill, a petroleum economist and former Exxon Corp. executive in  Houston. That means ""prices five years down the road,"" he said.    Most industry executives expect crude oil prices to fall from their current  high levels once the crisis is resolved, removing the long-term financial  incentive for dramatic increases in U.S. drilling.    Unocal's stepped-up drilling plans ""reflect the use of additional cash that's  coming into the upstream (exploration and development) part of the company  because of higher oil prices,"" said John F. Imle Jr., a Unocal senior vice  president.    But, he added, these are projects that were planned all along based on oil  price projections made before the Middle East crisis began. They are not  marginal projects that suddenly appear more attractive simply because prices  have jumped for now.    The 93 new wells, including 20 in California, are expected to increase the  company's net production of oil and liquids by 5,700 barrels a day by 1991.    Last week, Unocal Corp. reported that third-quarter earnings had risen 53% to  $121 million from $79 million in the like period a year earlier.    Other companies that have recently stepped up drilling include:    * Chevron, which in August said it would spend an additional $100 million in  1990 on domestic oil and natural gas production, an increase of about 10% over  its total U.S. exploration and production budget. The money would be used to  drill about 130 development wells in major existing oil fields in California,  Colorado, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.    * Conoco Inc., which said it would increase its 1990 exploration and production  budget by $10 million, to $540 million, to drill five new exploration wells in  the Gulf of Mexico that had been originally scheduled in 1991.    * British Petroleum and Atlantic Richfield Co., which, since the Middle East  crisis began, have stepped up a program of well stimulation on Alaska's North  Slope, helping to boost production. Separately, they announced plans to spend  $1.1 billion on a long-term gas handling project designed to arrest the decline  of Alaskan oil production.    Elsewhere, there are signs that oil drillers have increased their activity  since Iraq invaded Kuwait.    This week, the number of active oil and natural gas rigs increased to 1,107  from 1,010 a year ago, according to the widely consulted rig count report  released Monday by oil services company Baker Hughes Inc.    The rig count, which is a measure of the number of rigs exploring for oil, has  risen in eight of the last 10 weeks and is at its highest level in about 2 1/2  years, said Baker Hughes spokesman Ron Turner in Houston.    Overall, the oil industry had planned to increase upstream spending in 1990  independent of the Middle East crisis, expecting oil prices to rise gradually  on their own. But there remain real impediments to dramatic increases in  domestic oil drilling, and most oil companies have been shifting their efforts  overseas.    The oil industry argues that the likeliest sources of large, new oil  discoveries in the United States are off limits, including offshore areas and  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.    In addition, the number of available drilling rigs and rig crews has dropped  dramatically since the oil boom of the early 1980s. In December, 1981, the rig  count peaked at 4,500.

0,FT931-8655 ,"FT931-8655 _AN-DBRCKADCFT 930218   FT  18 FEB 93 / Technology: Dress sense in Antarctica      By DELLA BRADSHAW   Trudging to work in February may present as much of a challenge as many of us ever want in finding suitably warm clothing. But for Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Michael Stroud, who have just completed a record-breaking crossing of the Antarctic, suitable clothing required more than just comfort. 'When you're walking across the Antarctic comfort becomes less important than performance,' points out Les Jacques, textile centre manager for ICI Fibres. 'It's a question of life or death.' The performance requirements of polar explorers are peculiar. 'They don't carry a single waterproof item,' explains Oliver Shephard, who accompanied Sir Ranulph on many of his explorations. In the South Pole it simply does not rain. Nor, for the most part of the day, do the explorers require very warm clothing. 'Pulling a 450lb sledge you get mighty warm,' Shephard points out. Instead the main requirement on a continent where winds can reach speeds of up to 200mph are for clothes that are windproof, and 'breathable' - so that perspiration is not held against the skin. If that does happen the moisture can freeze when the garment is removed. That can be life-threatening, as the human body loses heat six to eight times more quickly when the skin is moist, burning up calories. All the fabrics worn by the explorers were man-made. They included specialist 'breathable' underwear, topped by thick, wind-proof trousers and a shirt. Thick jackets, resembling duvets, would be put on each morning. Once the men became warmer the thick jackets would be swapped for lighter, windproof outer clothing. Socks and gloves are made of specially treated fibres to ensure no sweat is retained next to the skin. The technology to produce fabrics incorporating 'moisture management', as it is known, has been pioneered in the sports and ski-wear industry. Aerobic outfits, for example, can be lined with a coating, such as ICI's Tactel, to take the moisture away from the skin and prevent post-exercise chill. Gore-Tex has proven particularly popular as a fabric coating to protect from wind and rain, for mountaineering equipment or ski-wear. Other coatings are being developed: these days some garments are even coated with Teflon, more popularly used on non-stick saucepans. 'It is very easy to make things which are waterproof, windproof or breathable,' says Andrew Geere, marketing manager of Berghaus, which makes mountaineering and other outdoor equipment. 'It's getting all three into a fibre which is very difficult.' Given the effectiveness of the latest high-technology fabrics it is perhaps surprising that recent expeditions have still favoured the duck-down sleeping bed as the favoured form of night-time insulation. And Shephard is rueful that pressure from animal rights groups means explorers can no longer wear animal skins. Wolf-skins, he points out, are far more effective than their synthetic imitators.

0,FT932-2896 ,"FT932-2896 _AN-DFQCFAACFT 930617   FT  17 JUN 93 / Government climbs down on tax relief for oil companies      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and ALISON SMITH   THE GOVERNMENT yesterday bowed to pressure from Tory backbench MPs over proposed changes to North Sea oil taxes, extending short-term help for companies worst affected by the changes. Although the Treasury said no new government spending would be involved, the change means that companies will find it easier to claim the Pounds 200m in aid which was earmarked - with tight restrictions - in the March Budget. But the amendments proposed by the Treasury may not go far enough to stem a backbench rebellion and the government may be forced to make further concessions. Mr John Butterfill, one of the leading Tory campaigners against the original Budget proposal, called the concession a very small move in the right direction. Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs, welcomed the move but said he hoped the government could be persuaded to move a bit further. The proposed changes to petroleum revenue taxes announced in the Budget caused a furore among many smaller companies in the oil industry because they abolished relief for exploration work. Companies said it would lead to a halving of exploration activity and the loss of up to 30,000 jobs. But larger companies such as British Petroleum welcomed the proposed reduction in the tax rate for existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. The Treasury yesterday admitted its original Budget proposals had made it too difficult for companies to claim transitional help to cushion them from the initial effects of the tax changes. In yesterday's amendment, the government said it would allow companies to claim up to Pounds 10m each until the end of next year for exploration work that will be affected by the abolition of tax relief. Mr Butterfill said he and others would press for the relief to be extended until 1996. 'It's a helpful step but far too modest,' he said yesterday. 'It will help one or two companies but it won't solve the fundamental problem.' Companies will be able to claim interim relief on wells they had committed to drill as part of obligations made to the Department of Trade and Industry in order to win licences to explore in the North Sea. The DTI was understood to be pushing the Treasury to loosen its restrictions on transitional aid. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said this week that applications for seven blocks in the latest oil licensing round had been withdrawn as a result of the PRT changes and that some companies had scaled back the number of wells they planned to drill. Backbenchers are likely to discuss the change with the oil companies before deciding how much further to press the government.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

The 36-strong standing committee that will consider the Finance Bill appears to contain a majority of MPs in favour of changing the government's Budget proposals in line with a suggestion by Mr John Butterfill, the Tory MP for Bournemouth East. Mr Butterfill has tabled an amendment to the bill that would provide some transitional relief for oil companies affected by the changes. The relief would be paid for by levying for a limited time a higher rate of petroleum revenue tax than the government proposes. But ministers insisted yesterday, ahead of today's Commons debate, that PRT would be cut from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, as set out in the Budget, and that tax relief for exploratory drilling would be abolished. The government indicated that its proposals would be enacted even if changes passed in committee had to be reversed at the report stage. Some companies have said that the government's changes would lead to a halving of exploration activity and the loss of up to 40,000 jobs. Ministers are understood to be sympathetic to the arguments advanced by the offshore supply industry, which fears the consequences of diminished exploration activity by their oil company customers. But ministers believe many of these companies are large and sophisticated enough to follow oil producers to other exploration sites if necessary. Ministers also argue that the supply industry will benefit from the surge in production they expect to follow enactment of the proposals. Some support for this view came yesterday when British Petroleum said it would bring forward a Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 2bn oil development project because of the proposed PRT changes. The company said yesterday its plans had been given 'significant impetus' by the tax changes. The project, which involves BP and eight other companies, will develop nine oil and gas fields containing 650m barrels of oil and 1,200bn cubic feet of gas. The improvement in the economics of the project mean production will start in 1998. BP said that under the old tax regime three of the fields would have paid PRT, making them less profitable. The government is also expected to argue today that changing its proposals now would penalise companies whose forward-planning had accommodated what was announced in the Budget. It is likely also to argue that the tax has actually cost the Treasury some Pounds 900m in the past two years. Gamble in the North Sea, Page 17   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The proposals would stop companies offsetting exploration and appraisal costs against income from fields which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax. Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said British-Borneo would almost certainly slow down exploration in the North Sea. He called for clarification of the government's intention to allow a two-year extension of PRT relief on existing contracts. It was not clear whether four wells British-Borneo had obligations to drill but on which work had not yet begun would qualify, he said. Revenues from oil and gas were up almost four times at Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 3.7m), outstripping for the first time revenue from the investment portfolio.

0,FT943-3148 ,"FT943-3148 _AN-EIOC7AETFT 940915   FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Defence of Enterprise offer cost Lasmo Pounds 24m      By PEGGY HOLLINGER   Three leading financial institutions received about Pounds 16m in fees to defend the loss-making oil explorer, Lasmo, from a hostile Pounds 1.6bn bid by rival independent Enterprise Oil. Schroders, Goldman Sachs and NatWest Securities were paid about two-thirds of the total Pounds 24m in bid costs, said Mr Joe Darby, chief executive. The rest went in charges such as legal fees. The failed bid has cost shareholders in the two companies almost Pounds 50m. Enterprise disclosed last week that its costs, including an Pounds 18.3m writedown on the value of its 10 per cent stake in Lasmo, would come to Pounds 24m. Lasmo's comments came as it announced first-half net losses of Pounds 22m, against a Pounds 22m profit last time. While the bid costs appeared to push the company into the red, these were more than offset by a Pounds 36m gain on asset disposals. Turnover fell from Pounds 309m to Pounds 306m, partly due to the lower oil price. The results were largely in line with analysts' expectations. Yet the market was impressed with the cost-cutting achieved in the period. Operating costs per barrel fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 3.70. Mr Darby said he expected average costs for the year to fall to between Pounds 3.50 and Pounds 3.55 per barrel. By 1997, unit operating costs would be 25 per cent below 1993 levels. Lasmo now had the financial strength to pursue exploration opportunities and to develop its existing reserves, he said. The company aimed to produce about 210,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day by 1996, against the current 167,000. Gearing fell from 69 per cent to 37 per cent in the first half, largely due to a Pounds 219m rights issue in the spring. Mr Darby estimated that annual spending on exploration would average some Pounds 50m over the next three years. Of the 14 wells drilled in the first half, eight were successful and included two substantial finds in Algeria. Development expenditure was static at about Pounds 117m (Pounds 119m). There was no interim dividend (1.3p). The loss per share was 2.6p (2.8p profit). COMMENT Lasmo yesterday painted a picture of a company which was confident in its strategy and future. The City was inclined to agree. However, even after all the surgery, the company's finding costs will still only be on a par with its rivals. This highlights a fundamental problem for exploration companies, such as Lasmo and Enterprise, which have much higher finding costs than the majors. After losses this year, Lasmo should be just back in profit in 1995, assuming oil prices of Dollars 18. In 1996, a rising production and earnings profile should lead to substantially improved profits. The most tempting aspect for some investors, however, might be the very real prospect of a foreign income dividend this year.   Companies:-  Lasmo.     Schroders.

The postponement of drilling in the Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet, which were  tainted by oil from the catastrophic spill, marks the Bush Administration's  first significant decision on offshore drilling since the Exxon Valdez hit a  reef nearly two months ago.    The plan, approved late Tuesday by Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr.,  imposes a one-year delay on the scheduled lease of a vast 138-million-acre  package, postponing final action until August, 1991, to provide time for  scientists to gather more information about the effects of the oil spill on the  pristine marine environment.    A senior aide to Lujan emphasized that the decision on the Cook Inlet site ""in  no way diminishes"" the Administration's commitment to a separate plan for oil  exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That proposal has been the  target of criticism from environmentalists since the Alaska spill.      'Much to Learn'    But the aide, Steve Goldstein, said Lujan had decided that it ""would not be  prudent to go forward with the new lease sale immediately after a major  accident. It is quite clear that we have much to learn from what happened.    ""This should not be read as a cancellation,"" Goldstein said. ""This is a  postponement to gather information while new facts are coming to light.""    The surprise deferral of the Cook Inlet sale, from which the government had  expected to earn $10 million next year, sends a further signal of the  Administration's willingness to reconsider some long-term drilling plans  established by the Interior Department under former President Ronald Reagan.    Among the proposed sales now being re-evaluated are vast areas off the coast of  Southern California and Northern California, which are being reviewed by a  presidential task force headed by Lujan.    ""This is a very cautious Administration when it comes to offshore drilling,""  one Republican official said, ""and this is just a further indication of that.""    However, Administration officials have given no indication that drilling in  those regions would be canceled altogether. And they have expressed a  determination to proceed with other oil exploration in the Alaskan wildlife  refuge and in offshore tracts where drilling rights already have been leased to  oil companies.    Plans for oil exploration in one such already-leased area, Alaska's Bristol  Bay, have been the principal target of drilling opponents since the Valdez  spill. Administration officials said Tuesday that those plans would not be  affected by the decision on Cook Inlet, because Bristol Bay was not affected by  the spill.    Critics of offshore drilling praised the Administration action as a welcome  step. But many argued that the disastrous consequences of the spill already  have made cancellation of the new drilling plans imperative.    ""This is the least they can do,"" said Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), warning  that the Administration and the oil industry might seek to resume ""business as  usual once the political heat dies down.""    Another drilling critic, Natural Resources Defense Council attorney Lisa Speer,  said that she could not understand why the Interior Department did not act to  postpone other Alaska leases as well until the environmental damage of the  spill can be determined.    ""We've already seen the terrible damage that can be wrought by oil in Alaskan  environments,"" Speer said.    While the Cook Inlet lease sale now has been postponed until at least a year  from its scheduled date of August, 1990, the current Interior Department  schedule calls for at least five other new lease sales to take place next year.    They include two sales off Alaska, two in the Gulf of Mexico and one off North  Carolina and other Mid-Atlantic states. In addition, the lease sales off  Northern and Southern California could proceed if authorized by the  presidential task force.    The postponement of drilling in Alaska, scheduled to be announced by Lujan  today in San Francisco, covers an area known as Lease Sale 114. The majority of  the tract is in the Gulf of Alaska, where it ranges from three to 400 miles  from shore. A smaller portion is in the Cook Inlet, three to 38 miles from  shore.

0,FT922-3472 ,"FT922-3472 _AN-CFKBHACNFT 920611   FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Vietnam opens up more oil exploration blocks      By NEIL BUCKLEY   VIETNAM has opened up four more oil blocks off its southern coast to exploration by foreign companies, PetroVietnam, the state oil company, said yesterday. Mitsubishi of Japan, the Astra Group of Indonesia and British Gas are the latest companies to reach provisional accords in a region which is attracting increasing interest from foreign oil producers, as they seek to replace their reserves. Bidding for the final block was still going on, PetroVietnam said. Lasmo, the independent UK oil producer, announced last week that it had won a joint tender with C. Itoh, the Japanese trading company, in the same area. That was followed this week by an announcement from British Petroleum and Statoil, the Norwegian state-owned oil company, that they had formally confirmed a production-sharing contract with PetroVietnam for a concession offered in the first licensing round. Vietnam has now allocated nine of the 10 blocks south-east of the southern coastal town of Vung Tau to foreign bidders. The blocks were originally to be explored by Vietsovpetro, a joint venture with the Soviet Union, but were handed back to Vietnamese control a year ago, after Hanoi complained that Moscow lacked the technology to develop them.

The company, due to address analysts next week, cited delays in the publication of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the future structure of British Gas, a major customer, and lower than expected demand from the water industry. Williams Holdings added 7 at 309p after Strauss Turnbull advised investors to switch out of TI Group, 7 lower at 338p. The leading pharmaceutical issues made a bold attempt to move ahead during the early part of the day, helped by the strong performance of Wall Street overnight, but quickly ran into pockets of resistance as the London market got under way. The two Zeneca stocks, strong performers in London late on Wednesday when the Fleming buy note impacted on the market, initially edged higher before slipping to close marginally easier on the day. The 'old' lost 2 at 621p and the 'new' nil-paid 1 1/2 at 21p. Turnover in the 'old' was 5.2m shares and in the 'new' 8m. The constant takeover speculation in Fisons, which has picked up since the official launch of the company's anti-ashtma drug Tilade earlier this week, drove the stock up to 177p before closing at 175p, up 3 on balance. SmithKline Beecham put on 5 at 451p and Glaxo managed to stay in positive territory, rising marginally to 595p. Another series of excellent results from the utilities ensured renewed strong interest in the sub-sectors. Water stocks were again heavily traded, with the second liners initially taking up the running after being left behind by the FT-SE 100 contituents. Of the smaller stocks, Northumbrian was the best performer, closing 4 harder at 581p. Southern eased 4 to 505p in spite of the 9.2 per cent increase in the dividend total, at the top end of expectations. Towards the close the sector retreated. Severn Trent Water, at 483p, gave up 13 of its recent advance: the preliminary figures, including the 9.3 per cent rise in the dividend, were close to best expectations. North West Water lost 7 to 467p, Anglian 8 to 476p and Thames 10 to 466p. The electricity sector's 'dividend race' hotted up as South Wales Electricity topped East Midland's 14 per cent payout with a 14.9 per cent increase. But profit-taking in the electricity sector kept the lid on the shares, which settled 2 easier at 546p. An early rally ahead of a September dividend was said to be behind the changing fortune of Dalgety, which strengthened 6 to 462p. Bensons Crisps advanced 8 to 76p in anticipation of favourable comment and Booker registered a rise of 13 at 381p on the appointment of a new chief executive. Investor faith continued for Guinness after a presentation in London by LVMH, the French luxury goods manufacturer with whom Guinness has a 24 per cent cross-shareholding. It moved up 6 to close at 495p in a volume of 3.2m. Bass firmed 2 to 484p but Allied- Lyons slipped 5 to 532p. A heavy two-way business was seen in Burton Group, which edged up  3/4 to 86 3/4 p as 17m shares were traded. In a continued show of confidence following the better than expected interim results, Granada Group added 5 at 420p. Feeling in the market strengthened that Forte may be close to making an acquisitive move for Savoy Hotel, whose 'A' stock climbed 30 to 835p while Forte's share price slipped a penny to 219p. The government's moves to amend the new Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) regime was seen as good news for the smaller exploration companies by the leading broking houses. Mr Simon Flowers, exploration and production analyst at NatWest Securities, said the news was 'particularly bullish for companies planning to spend up to Pounds 10m on exploration over the next two years and which stand to pay PRT in the near term'. NatWest said virtually all smaller explorers will see their net asset values boosted, and mentioned the clearest winners as Aran, Hardy and Goal. The broker added that Lasmo and Enterprise would gain from the changes but that their exploration budgets would be too large for the changes to be material. Other brokers took the view that the changes were moderately positive. Hardy Oil rose 6 to 168p, additionally helped by the results. Aran held at 33p and Goal edged up a penny to 64p.

More than 20 MPs gathered at a meeting organised by Mr Cranley Onslow, former chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, to hear complaints from the oil industry that it was already losing contracts as a result of the government's decision. In the Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, announced an end to oil companies' rights to set their exploration costs against their total petroleum revenue tax bill. The effect will be to increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies which have been able to take advantage of the PRT offset. Mr John Butterfill, MP for Bournemouth West who attended the meeting, said: 'Our intention is to convince the government that damage is already being done to all sorts of industries as a result of what is going on.' During discussions in the committee stage of the finance bill Ms Harriet Harman, shadow Treasury spokesperson, said that the government's claim that it was helping those on lower incomes by widening the 20 per cent band on income tax was bogus. Instead the government was increasing the burden of taxation and hitting the poor hardest by freezing personal tax allowances and increasing indirect taxes.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Chicago-based group reported earnings of Dollars 234m, or 47 cents a share, compared with Dollars 492m, or 98 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues fell to Dollars 6.4bn from Dollars 7.3bn. The figures were helped by a Dollars 67m tax benefit and Dollars 20m due to early debt retirement, partly offset by a Dollars 39m Norwegian tax charge. Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman, said: 'The earnings decline reflects lower crude oil and natural gas prices and continued weak margins and sales volumes for chemicals and lower margins for refining, marketing and transportation.' The company, which previously announced a capital and exploration budget of Dollars 3.7bn for the year, said it was re-evaluating this in view of the 'current adverse economic conditions affecting the industry'. Domestic exploration and production earnings of Dollars 145m were down 33 per cent, while foreign activities incurred an Dollars 11m loss, compared with earnings of Dollars 95m.

The company said last May that a sample of 160 tonnes of ore had yielded at least 90 carats of diamonds, of which about a quarter appeared to be of gem quality. BHP, the Australian mining group, has rights to a majority interest in the Dia-Met property. De Beers and Kennecott, the North American subsidiary of Britain's RTZ, are among numerous other companies which have joined the diamond stampede, in which a total of about 23m acres has been staked. Mr John Lydall, First Marathon's mining analyst, said in a report that exploration was still at an early stage and 'a huge amount' of work remained to be done. He said 'this entire exploration play remains an opportunity for prudent speculation'.   Companies:-  Credit Lyonnais.     Societe Generale.     Dia Met Minerals.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

The Chicago-based group reported earnings of Dollars 234m, or 47 cents a share, compared with Dollars 492m, or 98 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues fell to Dollars 6.4bn from Dollars 7.3bn. The figures were helped by a Dollars 67m tax benefit and Dollars 20m due to early debt retirement, partly offset by a Dollars 39m Norwegian tax charge. Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman, said: 'The earnings decline reflects lower crude oil and natural gas prices and continued weak margins and sales volumes for chemicals and lower margins for refining, marketing and transportation.' The company, which previously announced a capital and exploration budget of Dollars 3.7bn for the year, said it was re-evaluating this in view of the 'current adverse economic conditions affecting the industry'. Domestic exploration and production earnings of Dollars 145m were down 33 per cent, while foreign activities incurred an Dollars 11m loss, compared with earnings of Dollars 95m.

Chen Bingqian, CNOOC's vice-president, was quoted as saying  the two sides can join their efforts in ""whatever forms are  acceptable to both.""    He made the remark at a meeting with a delegation from  Taiwan's China Technical Consultants, Inc., whose members are  mainly from Taiwan's China Petroleum Corporation.    Chen told the delegation that CNOOC has forged links with  leading oil producers all over the world in the past decade and  struck 95 contracts and agreements with 54 oil companies from 13  countries on offshore oil development.    However, he said, ""It is a great pity that our counterparts  across the Taiwan Straits have been deprived of such  opportunities.""    The 11-member team from Taiwan is visiting the mainland to  study the petroleum and petrochemical industries in the coastal  areas and seek ways to co-operate.    Chen said co-operation between the mainland and Taiwan can  take many forms. The CNOOC can co-operate with the Taiwan  corporation directly or with its overseas subsidiaries; it can  co-operate with conglomerates grouping the Taiwan corporation's  overseas subsidiaries and foreign companies; and it can also  co-operate with independently-registered overseas companies  formed by the Taiwan corporation and foreign firms, he proposed.    He welcomed the corporation to render technical services for  the offshore operations carried out by the CNOOC and its foreign  partners.    The two sides can concentrate co-operative efforts on oil  exploration in the Taiwan Straits, the southwestern offshore  basin of Taiwan and the Chaoshan Depression, blocks in the East  China Sea and other offshore areas of interest, he added.    The vice-president also briefed the delegation on the  development of the CNOOC and its co-operation with foreign oil  companies at the request of the guests, the informed source said.    The delegation, at the invitation of the China Petrochemical  Corporation (Sinopec), arrived in Beijing January 6 to start a  month-long survey of oil and gas exploration and development,  oil refining, and the production and sale of petrochemical  products in the coastal areas.    According to the source, the team members showed enthusiasm  in raising questions and seeking co-operative projects.    The two sides reached agreement on enhancing exchanges  across  the Straits to end more than 40 years of isolation and find new  ways for co-operation.    Chen also asked the delegation to convey the greetings of  CNOOC President Wang Yan to the heads of the Taiwan corporation,  and said he hoped for early formal high-level contacts between  the two sides.    It was reported that the Taiwan corporation's leadership has  announced considering flexible approaches for cross-Straits co-  operation and has been working actively in this regard.    The source said many indications suggest a softening of  Taiwan's policy on investment flow to the mainland, which gives  rise to a ""cautiously optimistic prospect"" for co-operative oil  exploration.    The delegation is scheduled to end its survey February 5  before returning to Taiwan.     "

The market's knee-jerk reaction was that the oil majors, British Petroleum and Shell Transport, would be the main beneficiaries of the Budget changes, closely followed by the exploration and production stocks. BP had jumped 9 to 295p by the close, with turnover totalling 5m shares. Shell, sold down to 571p early in the session, finished a net 2 higher at 580p. The exploration and production stocks saw initial sluggish performance transformed into good gains across the board. Enterprise Oil settled 4 ahead at 492p and Lasmo, plagued by worries that the dividend may be cut when the preliminary figures are published later this month, gained 5 on balance at 186p. An analyst commented: 'Any reduction in the tax-take from the North Sea, on existing and new fields, has got to be seen as good news for the oil companies.' Premier Consolidated, with its raft of small marginal fields in the North Sea, was seen as a big winner from the Budget moves. The shares ended 2 3/4 up at 29 1/2 p.

Wang  Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), said  co-operation with foreign governments and companies, unfurling  offshore as well as onshore, will take more flexible forms.    In an interview with Business Weekly, Wang said a wide range  of joint ventures is to be forged to tap the country's petroleum  resources.    Wang revealed that Chinese and international oil firms are  working on possible joint ventures in upstream as well as  downstream operations.    Big projects can be expected to begin immediately once  approved by the government,    China's oil industry, which annually produces 144 million  tons of oil and 16 billion cubic metres of natural gas, has  absorbed $15 billion in overseas investment over the past 16  years.    Wang is leading a 54-member Chinese delegation to the 14th  World Petroleum Congress opening today in Stavanger, Norway.    Wang said the oil delegation, the largest the country has  ever sent abroad, will promote Chinese views and ideas on  overcoming global challenges in energy development.    China, which is to host the 15th World Petroleum Congress in  Beijing in 1997, expects important information to emerge in  Stavanger.    The Chinese delegates are to cultivate foreign countries'  views on energy development and discover new measures for  protecting the environment.    ""We hope exchanges on a wide range of topics in Norway will  help pave the way for greater foreign co-operation,"" Wang said.    He praised China's oil development over the past 15 years,  saying foreign co-operation has helped raise operations to a new  stage.    Chief among the accomplishments are that:    --About one-fifth of the country's land has been opened to  foreign oil exploration and development.    Foreign co-operation started 15 years ago in the country's  offshore areas, and was extended onshore last year with the  opening of international bidding for exploration in the Tarim  desert basin in XinJiang Uygur Autonomous Region.    Wang said exploration contracts with foreign firms are being  carried out.    Encouraged by China's open policies, foreign firms are not  only exploring virgin territory but are also enhancing the  recovery of oil in existing oilfields.    More than 70 foreign oil firms from 15 countries have  applied  for another round of bidding for onshore operations. Results of  the bidding are due within three months.    The foreign firms expect to explore 26 blocks and start 11  enhanced-recovery projects.    --Co-operative projects in oil refining and petrochemical  manufacturing are expected to satisfy the rising demand in  China, which anticipates 9 per cent economic growth in the next  seven years.    --Foreign companies will also work with Chinese on  engineering, technical research and equipment manufacturing.    Last year, CNPC signed $206 million worth of contracts for  engineering and labour services abroad. The volume equalled the  total for all of the 1980s.    --Preparations for overseas oil operations and financing are  under way.     "

This is the first acreage promotion held by the CNOOC,  following four rounds of international bidding for offshore oil  and gas exploration and development. The 13 blocks, with a  combined area of 40,000 square kilometers, are situated in the  basins of the Pearl river mouth, Yinggehai and Qiong Dongnan in  the South China Sea.    Gong Zaisheng, CNOOC's chief geologist, told XINHUA that the  principal objective of this acreage promotion was to expand  offshore oil and gas exploration, and his corporation would  present the geology of the blocks and the key targets for  exploration.    A total of 33 targets have been initially selected inside  the  blocks, he revealed, adding that CNOOC will answer questions on  the promotion and discuss technological issues with companies  interested in specific blocks.    He said the blocks in the Yinggehai and Qiong Dongnan basins  have good natural gas prospects. These blocks, originally  reserved for self-financed exploration, are now being promoted  only because of some inadequacies in funding and technology.    He said that especially the deep stratum in the region, so  far barely drilled because of high temperature and pressure, is  considered an exploration domain with great potential.    On the other hand, he said, the blocks in the pearl river  mouth basin were redefined, after careful analysis and  evaluation by Chinese experts, to include a batch of hopeful  targets for exploration.    CNOOC has told 80 foreign companies about the promotion, and  it was well received, said Gong, who is expected to head a  delegation to the United States for the promotion from June 20  to 24.    A seminar will be held in Adam's Mark Hotel, Houston, on  June  20, followed by detailed technical exchanges and discussions,  Gong added.    The oil companies will not need to worry about marketing  their products from natural gas exploration and development in  Yinggehai and Qiong Dongnan, he said, adding that the market in  the coastal area is vast.    CNOOC is considering the construction of a gas pipeline, as  soon as enough deposits are discovered, to link all the big  cities along the coast in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and  Hainan. ""This long-distance pipeline will give the gas to be  produced access to the market,"" Gong said.    The CNOOC signed 94 agreements and contracts with 55 oil  companies from 15 countries over the past ten years. Altogether  78 oil and gas-bearing structures have been discovered on  China's continental shelf, through cooperative and self-financed  exploration.    So far 1.2 billion tons of oil in place, and 180 billion  cubic meters of natural gas have been proven and controlled,  according to experts. The daily crude output of the corporation  has risen to 130,000 barrels, bringing the projected total for  this year to 5.5 million tons.    By 1997, the CNOOC is expected to produce 265,000 barrels of  crude and 10 million cubic meters of gas each day, experts said.     "

Currency gains fell sharply from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 85,000. Mr Peter Everett, chairman, said the currency effect and net profits decline masked a strong underlying performance, with the operating return for the six months to December 31 77 per cent higher at Pounds 1.65m. The return was achieved in spite of a marked weakening of oil prices from an average of Dollars 18.76 per barrel to Dollars 15.13. Turnover rose by 57 per cent to Pounds 7.52m. The increase was largely due to an early contribution from the Scott field in the North Sea, which came on stream in September. The company reached record production levels of 737,400 barrels of oil equivalent, of which some 220,847 had been produced by the Scott field. Pict was determined to continue its exploration programme, and had budgeted about Pounds 8m for projects this year. The company also said it intended to pursue further acquisitions abroad. Pict ended the first half with cash of Pounds 15.5m against Pounds 14.8m last year. Net debt was Pounds 13.5m, equal to 29 per cent of shareholders' funds. As in previous years, there is no dividend.

The properties are being sold to Apache, an independent energy company based in Houston, Texas. With net proven reserves of 81m barrels of oil and 220bn cubic feet of gas, the fields are roughly half as big as Apache's total reserves at the end of last year. The sale should be completed in the first quarter of next year, the two companies said. Texaco said the sale price amounted to Dollars 5.08 per barrel of oil equivalent. Texaco's move echoes steps taken by big US oil groups in recent years. Most have moved to shed smaller US fields, which they are often not able to develop and run as profitably as can smaller independent companies with lower overheads. Texaco said in July that it intended to dispose of a collection of smaller US fields which contributed 'zero to earnings and less than 10 per cent' of the company's cashflow from exploration and production activities in the US.

Rig manufacturers have already seen a big drop in work since last autumn. Two thirds of the 18,000 workers employed six months ago in fabricators' yards have lost their jobs. One yard has been mothballed. Further rationalisation and closures are inevitable, says the industry, with capacity running well ahead of orders. The situation could be made even worse if oil producers reduce exploration fur-ther. Some fabricators may be forced to pull out of the market - even if the government decides not to favour coal at the expense of gas production in the energy white paper expected today. The industry believes that up to half the 12 yards operated by the seven largest fabricators - Amec Offshore, Highlands Fabricators, McDermott Scotland, Redpath, RGC, SLP and UIE Scotland - may be vulnerable. Mr Syd Fudge, chairman of the Offshore Manufacturers and Constructors Association, which represents the seven fabricators, fears that the few remaining opportunities for British companies to tender for North Sea work may be reduced even further as a result of the government's policies. Mr John Walmesley, finance director of Enterprise Oil, says the effect of Budget tax proposals would be to take away much of the incentive to re-invest earnings in new projects in the North Sea. Under the Budget proposals, extraction from existing fields will become more economic while operators will no longer be able to offset exploration costs against the profits from existing fields. The changes could not have come at a worse time for fabricators. A large drop in orders had been expected as the level of North Sea construction, which had been strongly in manufacturers' favour in the late 1980s and early 1990s, began to drop. Investment emphasis is likely to change - most of the large, more easily exploited oil and gas fields were discovered when oil prices were equivalent to Dollars 40 to Dollars 50 a barrel at today's prices. But yesterday's price was just Dollars 18.60 a barrel. Future fields are likely to be smaller, more complex and more costly to develop, say producers. The recession, and the fact that oil prices are not expected to rise substantially in real terms, will limit further spending. Investment, they say, is more likely to be in repair and maintenance rather than in the construction of large new rigs. Production facilities are likely to be smaller, with new units hooking up to existing, larger production platforms. That will mean less need for large assembly yards, many of which are in the former shipbuilding areas of north-east England and Scotland. Numbers employed in the yards since September have fallen from more than 18,000 to approaching 6,000. Turnover of Pounds 1.5bn last year is likely to fall to just Pounds 500m this year. McDermott, the US owner of the Ardersier yard near Inverness, and one of northern Scotland's biggest employers, has announced redundancy for most of its remaining 500 workers. The yard, which 18 months ago employed 3,500 people, has run out of orders. Closures and the shift in work to care and maintenance, as in the case of Ardersier, will damage local economies further. The three yards operated by Amec at Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, generated a turnover of Pounds 200m last year of which Amec estimates 80 per cent is spent in the local economy. This year turnover is likely to be nearer Pounds 100m - indicating a net loss to the community of about Pounds 80m. Companies are looking to overseas work to offset the decline in UK orders. In most cases this will involve selling management expertise rather than providing employment for British workers and suppliers of materials and components. The exception is for work for the Norwegian sector of the North Sea but competition is tough and tends to favour the home players.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Wang Tao, president of China National Petroleum Corp.  (CNPC),  unveiled the second round of international bidding here today.    The first round for exploring oil and gas in the Tarim Basin  in China's remote Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region ended last  year. An initial petroleum contract has been signed between the  CNPC and the Exxon and the Japan Oil Company group. More  commercial negotiations are under way.    Wang said the projects now open to foreign bidding fall into  two categories -- risk exploration and enhanced oil recovery  projects. Registration will begin on February 15, 1994.    In the first category, 26 exploration blocks in China's nine  provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of  Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Hubei,  Gansu, Qinghai and Tianjin are inviting foreign bids.    According to Wang, oil resources in these blocks with a  total  area of 216,000 square kilometers are estimated at 6.2 billion  tons and natural gas resources at 800 billion cubic meters.    ""This indicates a good prospect for exploration,"" Wang said.    He added that most blocks are located near industrial and  agricultural centers with convenient transportation  infrastructures, which will surely facilitate operations there.    Wang assured that international conventions and formulas for  product-sharing will be adopted in this round of bidding as in  the previous one. Foreign companies will be solely responsible  for all exploration risks in the contract blocks.    Commercial discoveries will be jointly developed by Chinese  and foreign partners while post-tax profits will be shared in  accordance with the terms and conditions set in the contracts.    Wang said the second category covers enhanced oil recovery  projects in 11 developed blocks scattered in the eight mature  oil fields of Shengli, Dagang, Huabei, Jianghan, Henan, Jiangsu,  Zhongyuan and Jilin.    Total oil-bearing area in the blocks is 190.2 square  kilometers with oil reserves of 380 million tons in place. The  recovery factor in these blocks varies from 18.3 to 85.3 percent  of the recoverable reserves, Wang told the conference.    Located within developed fields, with reliable resources,  complete infrastructures and guaranteed logistic support, these  projects are expected to be quick to produce results.    In the projects, foreign companies will shoulder risks  alone,  or together with the Chinese side, for pilot tests. The two  sides will be joint operators after stimulation methods are  chosen and share the incremental increases in oil following tax  payment.    Wang said foreign companies are free to forward their  tenders  individually or to bid through the formation of consortiums.    The registered foreign companies will start data review,  purchase data packages and make field trips from March 1 to  August 1, 1994. The bidding is scheduled to end on August 30,  1994, followed by bid evaluation.    Wang said China is looking for overseas cooperation in  downstream utilization of oil and gas, construction of  long-distance oil and gas pipelines and manufacturing of special  petroleum equipment as well as engineering and technical  services.    It will also seek foreign partners to explore and develop  oil  and gas resources outside China, Wang added.     "

What is happening today  is an industrial revival from the shutdown that followed the Challenger space  shuttle disaster in 1986. U.S. rocket makers now see ""an attractive, albeit  thin, market,"" says Alan Lovelace, general manager of General Dynamics space  systems division. But they recognize that today's full order books are the  result of the backlog that developed in the Challenger aftermath, when nothing  was launched, and that when things settle down, the orders will be only a  trickle. Hughes Aircraft, the leading satellite maker with more than half the  40 commercial satellites now in space, estimates about five launches a year.    Yet today's renewed enthusiasm is important, helping U.S. industry to begin the  real work of the next decade, which will be laying the groundwork of space  platforms and communications systems for the wide-ranging exploration of space  that is sure to come in the 21st Century.    And the revival is timely because competitors have been active. The European  space consortium, Arianespace -- funded by 13 individual nations -- leads the  world; it has put up 23 satellites in the past four years and has orders to  launch almost four dozen more. China and the Soviet Union are offering launch  services at cut-rate prices.    Not surprisingly, Japan has ambitious plans for space. In 1992, Mitsubishi  Heavy Industries will launch its H-2 rocket, and in the mid-1990s will put up  the Japan Environmental Module, which is scheduled to accompany the U.S. space  station. Beyond that, Japanese companies are being encouraged to think big by  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which is holding a  competition for ideas on space exploration in the next century.    Meanwhile, despite today's enthusiasm, U.S. industry may not have smooth  sailing when Congress gets the $30-billion bill for the space station,  scheduled for launch in 1995 and envisioned as both a center for experiments  and a platform for planetary exploration. There will be cries that it's a  boondoggle and that space isn't a real profit-making business anyway.    But that's not true. First, as the Europeans and Japanese understand, projects  like the space station are needed to support the early stages of a new  industry. And profit margins on space business are already good, says Donald  Robinson, vice president of planning for American Rocket. American charges  $800,000 a launch on small rockets and earns $200,000.    Furthermore, space is a business with a considerable record of success. Today's  commercial rocket launches are not the dawn of the space business but the  second stage of a developing industry, says General Dynamics' Lovelace, a  one-time NASA official. Communications satellites -- the first stage -- have  been a business for decades.    Now we have launches, space-age trucking really. And the next stages, Lovelace  says, will be in Earth remote sensing -- bringing to commercial business the  work being done by spy satellites -- and weather control.    Truth is, today's enthusiasm is not misplaced. Space exploration has already  brought us wonders that we take for granted -- the techniques of image  enhancement for pictures from space have brought our hospitals computerized and  magnetic resonance brain and body scanning. And while U.S. industry must now  make up for some lost time, the advances of U.S. computer technology give  America an edge in space for the decade ahead.

0,FT923-12271 ,"FT923-12271 _AN-CGTAYACHFT 920720   FT  20 JUL 92 / Asean set to discuss islands dispute      By JOSE GALANG      MANILA   FOREIGN ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) converge in Manila today for discussions this week on concrete programmes to expand regional co-operation. The meeting takes place against a backdrop of the continuing territorial disputes involving three Asean members - Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines - and China, Vietnam and Taiwan over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. All six countries have claims over the islands. The disputes could deteriorate shortly with the expected start of oil exploration in the area. The meeting is the first since the January accord among the six Asean governments, which include Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand - to transform the region into a free-trade area by 2007. They will discuss ways to strengthen Asean's ability to cope with a changing international environment and then discuss trends in trade, investment and development with counterparts from their main economic partners: the EC, US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Raul Manglapus, Asean standing committee chairman and Philippines foreign affairs secretary, confirmed yesterday that the Spratly disputes will be discussed. China and Vietnam have awarded contracts separately to western companies to drill for oil in the disputed territories. Vietnam recently increased its campaign by wooing Malaysia with participation in an exploration venture. Over the past few weeks, China is said to have planted a territorial marker on a reef and had authorised its army to use force if necessary to control the islands.

The talks, expected to last two to three days, are the first formal negotiations on the most challenging and complex issue facing the two sides, apart from the central question of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. It has long been rumoured that the seabed around the islands holds large oil reserves. However, there has been no exploration in the region since an inconclusive survey in the 1970s. Last year, London authorised the local Falkland Islands government to issue seismic exploration licences, bringing the fraught issue of oil resources to the fore. If oil is found in commercial quantities around the islands, co-operation with Argentina would be essential to develop the reserves. Major gasfields have been found in Argentine waters between Tierra de Fuego and the Falklands, but, so far, little oil has been found. Although both sides will use this week's talks to set out their points of view, issues such as harmonisation of legislation, law enforcement, taxation, environmental policies and the demarcation of zones are yet to be addressed. Inevitably, they will touch either directly or indirectly on the sensitive issue of sovereignty. The islands' councillors have yet to pass any oil legislation. Their laws will depend on the outcome of the talks with Buenos Aires. However, Argentina does not recognise the Falklands' local government.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Cable cars crisscross the great mountains of Europe, trash lines the routes  into the Himalayas and Mt. Everest is overcrowded with expeditions. ""Most of  the expeditions the last five years have been less for adventure and more for  show,"" Messner says.    That is the inspiration for Messner's ""White Wilderness"" concept to defend the  world's remaining unexplored regions against abusive intrusion -- white in that  they appear as blank areas on maps, places where only Messner and others like  him care to go.    He expounded on his idea this month at the Mountain Summit, a gathering  organized by Dan McConnell of Seattle of some of the world's best climbers,  among whom Messner is a giant. He has made more than 3,000 climbs, including  about 100 firsts and all 14 of the world's peaks that reach higher than 8,000  meters (26,000 feet), most without using oxygen, and several alone.    Climbs, he says, not conquests. Messner has paid a dear price. He has lost a  brother and several friends, six toes and a fingertip, the latter because of  frostbite.    ""I never conquer a mountain,"" he said. ""You cannot conquer a mountain. This  (thinking) is typical of the '50s.""    In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand, and Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay  became the first to ascend Everest, the highest of all at 29,100 feet,  according to a recent re-survey. The feat launched a new era in mountaineering  and elevated the high-altitude climber into a romanticized role that few  non-climbers can really understand.    ""I see the mountain as a big piece of nature which excludes human beings, and  should remain like this,"" Messner said. ""You can't go and see it, and it's  difficult to watch on television, especially live.""    Those who have experienced it know that the mountain is not something  beautiful, Messner said.    ""It's something strong and destroying people,"" he said. ""It's something for  staying a few weeks, a few months, but not forever.""    So Messner will leave the mountains alone for a while and alter his goals from  vertical to horizontal. In October, he and Arvet Fuchs will attempt to walk  across Antarctica without support or the use of sled dogs.    ""I had a chance to have live television on the Antarctica expedition and I  refused,"" Messner said. ""It would not be the same thing. I would have to  prepare such a big expedition that my experience, my adventure, would not be  the same.""    His purpose: ""I go to show it is still a clean place for adventure -- not to  store atomic wastes or to explore for (oil).""    Messner, 44, grew up in the Sud Tirol region of northeastern Italy, a  cross-culture pocket of German-speaking people whose Alpine territory has been  disputed since medieval times.    It was Austrian territory until after World War I, when it became part of  Italy. But at the outbreak of World War II, according to Messner, 90% of the  people identified more with Hitler's Third Reich than with Mussolini -- a fact,  he says, that ""nobody likes to speak about.""    Messner, born at the end of World War II, wrote one of his 29 books on the  subject.    His home, he says, is ""one of the most beautiful climbing areas of the world,  like Yosemite Valley. Maybe more beautiful. Now they made roads and (it's) all  full of skiing areas.    ""When I was 5 years old, I did my first climb with my father . . . climbed a  10,000-foot peak. And from there, a little more difficult every year.""    Messner started as a rock climber, with no interest in lofty summits, but it  was probably inevitable that as he exhausted the available challenges he would  find his way to the Himalayas -- there, to mold his ethic to climb without  oxygen and to climb alone.    ""On my first expedition at 8,000 meters I left my brother, and my second  expedition at 8,000 meters I left two friends,"" he said. ""After that, I said,  'In the future, I will do it alone so I am not responsible for them.'    ""But the other reason is the experience: to be alone with your own fears. If  you are on your own in a difficult situation, it's difficult to handle it by  yourself . . . nobody to lean on. It's much more difficult to climb without a  partner than without oxygen.""    Reinhold Messner, the most celebrated mountaineer of modern times, afraid?    ""Many times,"" he said. ""On all big climbs, there is a moment before you start  from base camp . . . knowing all the climbing history and all the things that  can happen on a big mountain. Each of us is human. We make mistakes.    ""If you are on top of the climbing scene, it is very difficult to stay alive on  the small line between doing something foolish and doing something great. If  you do one mistake in a difficult situation, you did it. Forever.""    But more than fear, Messner has respect for the mountains he climbs. He speaks  of approaching a mountain by ""fair means.""    ""I like to have for me, personally, the experience of what human beings are  feeling at 8,000 meters,"" he said. ""If I use oxygen, it's like going to 5- or  6,000 meters. If I climbed Everest with oxygen I would cheat myself.""    Then there is Messner the environmentalist, who has seen hundreds of empty  oxygen bottles strewn along the routes like aluminum cans.    ""If you don't carry oxygen up, you cannot leave a bottle up there,"" he said.    Once he reached two 8,000-meter summits on a single climb, descending only to  the saddle connecting them. It took eight days. He was alone. He used no  oxygen. It was dangerous.    So, it was suggested, is auto racing.    ""But in (auto racing) it is the velocity and the machine that decides (the fate  of the driver),"" he said. ""In a big climb, it is nature which decides. There  can be an avalanche, a storm.    ""But without the risk of death, climbing would not be the same. The motivation  would not be the same. With the risk of dying, it's a totally different  approach. We all know that death is one of the big taboos, especially for  Western people -- not for Asian people. The most important fact in our life is  we have to die. But normally we don't know this up to the end.    ""Going near death, you have a chance to know these things. Knowing about death  means having the interest to know more and more -- not to die.""    Few -- perhaps no one -- will ever reach the heights that Messner has achieved.    ""It will be more difficult for the next generation,"" he said. ""But they have to  surpass. Otherwise, they stay the same, and human beings can never stay the  same.    ""They can do more difficult routes (or) traverses (up one side, down the  other). They'll go up Everest someday on the South Face. It's still undone.""    Will he try it?    ""I'm the first to congratulate whoever does it,"" Messner said, smiling.    He would prefer, he said, a better legacy.    ""The next generations will not remember us for how many 8,000-meter peaks we  climbed or how many records we set, but how we left those wild places.""      Photo, Reinhold Messner of Italy is considered to be one of the world's  greatest mountain climbers, but his latest adventure will take him overland  across Antarctica.

The feat launched a new era in mountaineering  and elevated the high-altitude climber into a romanticized role that few  non-climbers can really understand.    ""I see the mountain as a big piece of nature which excludes human beings, and  should remain like this,"" Messner said. ""You can't go and see it, and it's  difficult to watch on television, especially live.""    Those who have experienced it know that the mountain is not something  beautiful, Messner said.    ""It's something strong and destroying people,"" he said. ""It's something for  staying a few weeks, a few months, but not forever.""    So Messner will leave the mountains alone for a while and alter his goals from  vertical to horizontal. In October, he and Arvet Fuchs will attempt to walk  across Antarctica without support or the use of sled dogs.    ""I had a chance to have live television on the Antarctica expedition and I  refused,"" Messner said. ""It would not be the same thing. I would have to  prepare such a big expedition that my experience, my adventure, would not be  the same.""    His purpose: ""I go to show it is still a clean place for adventure -- not to  store atomic wastes or to explore for (oil).""    Messner, 44, grew up in the Sud Tirol region of northeastern Italy, a  cross-culture pocket of German-speaking people whose Alpine territory has been  disputed since medieval times.    It was Austrian territory until after World War I, when it became part of  Italy. But at the outbreak of World War II, according to Messner, 90% of the  people identified more with Hitler's Third Reich than with Mussolini -- a fact,  he says, that ""nobody likes to speak about.""    Messner, born at the end of World War II, wrote one of his 29 books on the  subject.    His home, he says, is ""one of the most beautiful climbing areas of the world,  like Yosemite Valley. Maybe more beautiful. Now they made roads and (it's) all  full of skiing areas.    ""When I was 5 years old, I did my first climb with my father . . . climbed a  10,000-foot peak. And from there, a little more difficult every year.""    Messner started as a rock climber, with no interest in lofty summits, but it  was probably inevitable that as he exhausted the available challenges he would  find his way to the Himalayas -- there, to mold his ethic to climb without  oxygen and to climb alone.    ""On my first expedition at 8,000 meters I left my brother, and my second  expedition at 8,000 meters I left two friends,"" he said. ""After that, I said,  'In the future, I will do it alone so I am not responsible for them.'    ""But the other reason is the experience: to be alone with your own fears. If  you are on your own in a difficult situation, it's difficult to handle it by  yourself . . . nobody to lean on. It's much more difficult to climb without a  partner than without oxygen.""    Reinhold Messner, the most celebrated mountaineer of modern times, afraid?    ""Many times,"" he said. ""On all big climbs, there is a moment before you start  from base camp . . . knowing all the climbing history and all the things that  can happen on a big mountain. Each of us is human. We make mistakes.    ""If you are on top of the climbing scene, it is very difficult to stay alive on  the small line between doing something foolish and doing something great. If  you do one mistake in a difficult situation, you did it. Forever.""    But more than fear, Messner has respect for the mountains he climbs. He speaks  of approaching a mountain by ""fair means.""    ""I like to have for me, personally, the experience of what human beings are  feeling at 8,000 meters,"" he said. ""If I use oxygen, it's like going to 5- or  6,000 meters. If I climbed Everest with oxygen I would cheat myself.""    Then there is Messner the environmentalist, who has seen hundreds of empty  oxygen bottles strewn along the routes like aluminum cans.    ""If you don't carry oxygen up, you cannot leave a bottle up there,"" he said.    Once he reached two 8,000-meter summits on a single climb, descending only to  the saddle connecting them. It took eight days. He was alone. He used no  oxygen. It was dangerous.    So, it was suggested, is auto racing.    ""But in (auto racing) it is the velocity and the machine that decides (the fate  of the driver),"" he said. ""In a big climb, it is nature which decides. There  can be an avalanche, a storm.    ""But without the risk of death, climbing would not be the same. The motivation  would not be the same. With the risk of dying, it's a totally different  approach. We all know that death is one of the big taboos, especially for  Western people -- not for Asian people. The most important fact in our life is  we have to die. But normally we don't know this up to the end.    ""Going near death, you have a chance to know these things. Knowing about death  means having the interest to know more and more -- not to die.""    Few -- perhaps no one -- will ever reach the heights that Messner has achieved.    ""It will be more difficult for the next generation,"" he said. ""But they have to  surpass. Otherwise, they stay the same, and human beings can never stay the  same.    ""They can do more difficult routes (or) traverses (up one side, down the  other). They'll go up Everest someday on the South Face. It's still undone.""    Will he try it?    ""I'm the first to congratulate whoever does it,"" Messner said, smiling.    He would prefer, he said, a better legacy.    ""The next generations will not remember us for how many 8,000-meter peaks we  climbed or how many records we set, but how we left those wild places.""

0,FT942-4526 ,"FT942-4526 _AN-EFIC8ADRFT 940609   FT  09 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Crude logic   The flaws in Enterprise's industrial case for acquiring Lasmo have not been removed by its latest document. The weakest argument is that there would be savings from joint use of infrastructure. Enterprise argues that the profitability of future developments would be enhanced by cheap access to Lasmo's pipelines in Liverpool Bay and elsewhere. The snag is not simply that access on non-commercial terms would be impossible given that other companies also own stakes in the infrastructure. Even if it were possible, enhanced profitability of Enterprise's developments would merely be matched by reduced profitability of Lasmo's infrastructure. Another Enterprise argument - that its expertise in three-dimensional surveys could be applied to Lasmo - is hardly better. Lasmo has been using 3-D technology for over a decade. That leaves Enterprise's criticism of Lasmo's slow development of its Indonesian interests as the company's most persuasive argument. But even here, the case is not clear-cut. Lasmo's Sanga Sanga concession is fairly mature and so unlikely to yield vast new treasures. Enterprise should reconsider its strategy of trying to join the big boys' game. An alternative would be to return to its roots as an exploration company by splitting itself into two. One half could contain most of its current production assets as well as group debt. This company would pay investors handsome dividends and gradually liquidate itself. The other half would focus on exploration and would offer investors the hope of capital gains. Enterprise once toyed with this idea. When reminded of it today, the company said it was only joking.   Companies:-  Enterprise Oil.     LASMO.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Position: Latitude 64 degs 41 mins South / Longitude 62 degs. 37 mins West. Weather: Cloudy, 985 millibars. Temp: 2.50 air, - 0.50 sea. Wind: SW 4-5, sea calm. Vessel drifting off NE of Cuverville Is. Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3 humpback whales. There is no getting around it - Peter Skog, chief officer and keeper of the Explorer's log, will never be a Conrad. Is it his Swedish phlegm and unflappability? Is this the new marine minimalism of the 1990s? Or is there simply not enough space to wax lyrical in each entry? One way or another, Chief Officer Skog's prose style fails to do full justice to the Antarctic. Here we are, 75 fully-grown adults, all dressed identically in wellies and bright red parkas, full of hot breakfast and ready to go - as excited as six-year-olds on a school outing. And how does the chief officer record the moment? He makes a landing on a penguin-teeming, whale-surrounded, ice-berg-jammed antarctic island sound as thrilling as stepping off the No 38 bus on to the Edgware Road. Each time I wander up to the bridge to peek at the log a new literary disappointment awaits me. One dreads to think what calamity it would take to move him to passionate language - a giant tidal wave or a biblical parting of the waters might just do the trick. Rough sea and heavy swell, vessel pitching and rolling he wrote in the log two days ago as we crossed the notorious Drake Passage from Cape Horn to the Antarctic Peninsula. Good Heavens, in my cabin pitching and rolling was the least of it - all night long shoes, books, cameras, sets of drawers and anything else left unsecured whizzed back and forth between cabin door and porthole like things possessed. Not even the toilet paper was left in peace  -somehow an entire roll managed to unwind itself on to the floor in my cabin bathroom. Next morning, still in the heaving Passage, the dining room looked like the charge of the Light Brigade. Others may praise Drake, Magellan and Darwin, all, admittedly, fine sailors of these fearful southern seas. But I praise Alex, our Filipino waiter, who with a loaded tray can make his way from a crashing galley across a bucketing floor to a pitching table, all without spilling a drop. But will Skog record that in the log? No. Neither will he note that Alex is one of the few people on earth to have had his appendix removed in an emergency operation at an antarctic research station. Nor that he never forgets the Tabasco sauce. Are these not all exceptional feats deserving of record? In my honour roll of antarctic heroes, Alex stands somewhere near the top. Sea temperature -0.50 Skog has written in his passionless, dry-as-dust Nordic hand. Where does he mention that just yesterday some of the more adventurous souls aboard the Explorer, my own brave self included, went swimming in these frigid antarctic waters? Granted, it was Skog, and not I, who knew the secret of volcanic Pendulum Cove and its sand beach, geo-thermally heated from below. But where does he describe the great steaming and billowing, sloshing and wallowing that followed our landing? Skog might not be impressed, but I was. Pendulum Cove gave me a better bath than I can get from my miserable little hot water geyser in London. Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3 humpback whales, writes Skog, as if compiling a shopping list for Sainsbury's supermarket. But I can tell you that meeting these creatures face to face has nothing to do with buying pesto sauce or coffee beans. In the first place, pesto and coffee smell good; colonies of antarctic birds and mammals do not. Conrad himself would have trouble with the smell of a penguin colony - it is indescribable, but can knock you over at 50 yards. Guano aside, though, penguins have great attraction - they are cute and cuddly, curious and comic, and in their nesting thousands, wholly fascinating. In their black and white outfits they look much like French waiters, but are far more approachable. Seals are even more impressive - their smell can knock you over at 200 yards. And in some ways they are even more like humans than penguins - a contented, smelly and sociable herd of one-tonne elephant seal bachelors lying together in a steaming sea-side wallow puts me in mind of a post-match rugby-team locker room. And what about those cocky, argumentative, testosterone-driven male fur seals who spend much of their time vying for the favour of the females? Wind, waves, ice and water aside, I might be in my favourite local on a busy Saturday night. But like most passengers on the Explorer, I reserve my greatest interest for the whales. Skog can write 3 humpback whales and let it go at that if he likes. When you are in a Zodiac inflatable dingy and close enough to be drenched in the fine spray from a whale's blow-hole it is rather a different matter. There is nothing quite like the company of these vast animals as they lazily dive and spout and roll and wave their flippers and raise their flukes. Melville wrote hundreds of pages about the great drama between men and whales; you would think the miserable Skog might manage more than three words. But no. 1145 hrs: arrive Neumeyer Channel. Position: a spectacular channel, narrow and high sided, grander than any northern fjord. Weather: marvellous - crystal clear air, gloriously sunny, fresh and bracing - the kind of weather that makes you feel happy to be alive. Sea: full of blue curacao-coloured icebergs. Vessel crunching through jig-saw puzzle pack ice, surrounded by snow-covered mountains plunging steeply to the sea. Could Skog be be responsible for such a loose and fanciful entry? Of course not. Skog wrote nothing at this point. I have written it for him. The chief officer, apparently, does not believe breathtaking beauty worthy of recording. But while he enjoys measuring millibars, the rest of us enjoyed gazing out from the upper deck at some of the most astounding scenery we have ever seen - great ice cliffs, impossibly tall and pointed peaks, glaciers flowing at infinitesimal speed into the sea, weirdly sculpted icebergs, seals basking on sun-washed ice-floes. We were all impressed, and this is saying something, for the passengers aboards the Explorer - wealthy, well-travelled, and for the most part American - have high expectations. For my own part, I had no idea that such a continent existed - in my mind Antarctica was a bleak, desolate and lifeless place of little interest. On the contrary, it is now for me a place of the greatest interest. 1500 hrs: arrive Port Lockroy. Position: Lat: 64 degs 52 mins S / Long: 6252 W. Weather: partly cloudy, 982 millibars. Temp. 50 air, 00 sea. Sea calm. Vessel drifting off Port Lockroy. Gentoo penguins, leopard seals. Back to dull Skog's ditch-water delivery again. Does he never tire? Has he never stood on the rocks, surrounded by hundreds of clamorsome, roosting shags, and looked down into the waters of Port Lockroy as I did? How striking it is to watch penguins, slapstick, waddling, inept birds on land, transform themselves into marvels of dynamic design in the water. With just one hop from a rock they become agile, graceful creatures, as fast as torpedoes as they flash about in search of the fish and shrimp-like krill that is their prey. One moment of marine game-watching in Port Lockroy remains with me: that instant when, on a drifting ice-floe not five yards distant, a snoozing leopard seal awoke and yawned, showing me a great mouthful of needle-sharp teeth, then slipped silently into the water. There is nothing furry or cute about leopard seals - they can flay a penguin right out of its skin with a few tosses of their powerful heads. The moment that seal slid below the surface, the hunters became the hunted. But does Skog appreciate the thrill of the wild, the vitality of life, the inevitability of sudden death? Gentoo penguins, leopard seals is all he can find to write. But then Swedes have always been a squeamish lot when it comes to high drama. In their country I have seen dairy cows with rubber bulbs fitted to their horns in order that they cause no undue harm or excitement. Poor Skog, perhaps he should not be blamed. 2000 hrs: arrive Paradise Bay. Position: Lat: 65 degs 42 mins S / Long: 6252 W. Weather: overcast, 984 millibars. Temp: 0.50 air, 00 water. Vessel drifting off Paradise Bay. BBQ, then Zodiac tours, landing on the Antarctic continent. All is forgiven] In that last sentence taken from the log today I detect a tiny soupcon, the merest hint of understanding, of what it is to be Man the Explorer. But it is enough. Until now, the fourth of 10 days of cruising, we have only visited islands lying off the coast of Antarctica. This evening we land on the continent itself, and Skog has recognised the heroic symbolism of that act. A literary milestone. If there is any doubt as to the significance of the event, there is, as the chief officer notes, to be a magnificent outdoor meal served on the rear deck, with a penguin - even now being chiselled in ice by a skilled Filipino chef - as the centrepiece to our blithe, mulled-wine-swilling company. And if that is not enough, the captain is up on the bridge at this moment preparing a Certificate of Antarctic Exploration for each of us. We have 'joined the ranks of Scott and Shackleton', it informs us, 'and ventured to set foot on Antarctica, the biggest, coldest, driest, windiest, loneliest, most remote and least-known continent on earth'. Not only that, but we are now dedicated to 'honour the brave pioneer Antarctic explorers who sailed these frozen seas before us, and to protect the Antarctic Continent for those who will follow'. That is certainly quite a big mouthful for one small step, even if it is on to Antarctica. No matter how much the chief officer has loosened up, I am sure he would not approve of the tone of such a document - could that be why he has left the captain alone on the bridge and is down here with us munching BBQ?

The result of the investigation will be vital to the company's future, but on any likely outcome life will continue to be pretty tough. With the RPI-5 price formula and increased competition, earnings this year are likely to be around 22p a share. That means dividend cover will only be 1.5 times against the company's declared target of a twice covered payout. Interest cover is close to the company's own comfort level of four times. Meanwhile capital expenditure - particularly on exploration and production - will mean a further cash outflow this year. Those financial ratios might seem comfortable for a pure utility, but the profile of the business is shifting markedly. Even if some of the more radical suggestions are ignored by the MMC, competition in the UK gas business will increase, lessening the security of the utility franchise. At the same time, the heavy investment in exploration and production is taking the company into higher risk areas which will not start to produce substantial returns until 1995. If the MMC produces a particularly tough report, that might even force a hard look at the dividend. On a milder outcome, the prospects for dividend growth will still be severely limited. The 6 per cent yield on British Gas shares is supposed to reflect uncertainty over the MMC investigation.

A year earlier, Exxon had net earnings of Dollars 1.3bn, or Dollars 1.03, including non-recurring gains of Dollars 158m. Revenues fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 27.26bn from Dollars 27.91bn in the first three months of 1992. Mr Lawrence Rawl, outgoing chairman, said the company's reduced operating expenses helped staunch earnings erosion in the quarter in spite of sluggish economic conditions in Exxon's leading markets. On Wall Street, shares in Exxon fell Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 64 1/4 yesterday. During the first three months of 1993, Exxon benefited from higher crude oil prices and higher sales of chemical products. On the other hand, petroleum product and chemical margins were weak in the quarter.

The Abu Dhabi authorities made the offer to Mr Yoshiro Nakayama, honorary chairman of Cosmo Oil, when he visited the United Arab Emirates in April, Cosmo said. Japan accounts for about half of Abu Dhabi's total crude oil exports. Negotiations are still underway, but if a deal is finalised it would help Cosmo to take its long-term goal of expanding its Middle Eastern production a step further. It has been producing oil at the Mubarraz concession in Abu Dhabi since 1973 through a joint venture company with Japan Energy. However, output at Mubarraz has been on the decline from a peak of 30,000 barrels per day in 1979 to about 15,000 b/d. An award of new exploration and development rights in Abu Dhabi could bolster Cosmo's financial performance. Exploration and production is where profits are to be made, although Japanese oil companies have concentrated on downstream operations, said Mr Nicholas Smith at Jardine Fleming. Oil companies and the Japanese government have been keen to win development rights in the Gulf to ensure a steady source of oil for the country, which has few energy resources of its own. Japan depends on the Middle East for 70 per cent of its oil imports. But Japanese equity in international oil reserves accounts for only only 13 per cent of the country's total imports.

Reporting a 73 per cent surge in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.81m in the year to December 31, compared with Pounds 4.52m, the company said it would have to carry out a strategic rethink of its plans to expand significantly its activities in the North Sea. The proposals would stop companies offsetting exploration and appraisal costs against income from fields which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax, leaving them paying a net 64p for every Pounds 1 spent instead of 17p under present rules. Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said British-Borneo would almost certainly slow down exploration in the North Sea. He called for clarification of the government's intention to allow a two-year extension of PRT relief on existing contracts. It was not clear whether four wells British-Borneo had obligations to drill but on which work had not yet begun would qualify, he said. Revenues from oil and gas were up almost four times at Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 3.7m), outstripping for the first time revenue from the investment portfolio. Mr Gaynor said there was strong growth potential in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly in gas. He announced British-Borneo's first move into direct operating, through an operating consortium in the Gulf of Mexico with American Cometra, a subsidiary of Electrofina, and Ranger Oil of Canada.

0,FT941-2146 ,"FT941-2146 _AN-ECVCOAF3FT 940322   FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Disappointed oil explorers may cut Barents Sea losses      By KAREN FOSSLI      OSLO   Oil companies operating in Norway may decide to suspend activity in the Barents Sea after 13 years of disappointing results from 52 exploration wells costing an estimated NKr10bn (Pounds 910m). Several wells have yielded natural gas, but they are not considered commercially exploitable because of the long distances to markets and high development costs. With the current low level of oil prices and the high costs of exploring the remote region, companies say activity in the area is an 'exotic indulgence'. Recognising the decline in oil company interest in the area, the government recently proposed more attractive terms and conditions for exploring there. The authorities earlier linked the award of the most attractive Norwegian shelf exploration acreage to company commitment to invest in high-risk acreage such as the Barents Sea. Many oil companies have welcomed the proposed changes but nevertheless say they do little to enhance prospectivity, given low oil prices, distances to markets and Norway's stringent tax regime. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, says it must develop new strategies before it proceeds and is not likely to drill a new well in the region for at least two years. The group has spent some NKr2.5bn, about 25 per cent of total oil company exploration costs there. 'We're at a crossroads, and must soon decide whether - and how - we are going to continue in the southern Barents Sea or switch our attention to other parts of the Norwegian shelf,' Mr Tor Fjaeran, Statoil senior vice president for domestic resource development, said recently. He welcomed the new proposals but stressed that the potential for finding hydrocarbons - particularly oil - was the principal factor determining Statoil's commitment. Mr Fjaeran said oil companies' expectations for the region had been reduced because of the dominance of gas. 'The area is primarily a gas province and no way has been found for selling the gas already discovered,' he said. At the same time, according to Mr Fjaeran, present geological information suggested that only small oil discoveries could be expected, while environmental challenges added to costs. Statoil recently completed testing a Barents Sea discovery that yielded a high gas flow and low oil production and established that the find, though technically producible, was not commercial. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the industry watchdog, estimates the potential recoverable petroleum reserves of the region at 1.12bn tonnes of oil equivalent, of which oil accounts for 190m and gas 930m. About 260m tonnes of petroleum has been discovered, it says. Mobil Exploration Norway, a pioneer explorer in the area, has spent about NKr750m to drill seven wells. 'We have not completely lost interest, but we have to look at the Barents Sea compared with other prospective areas,' says a company executive.

0,FT921-13645 ,"FT921-13645 _AN-CAUBNAAGFT 920121   FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (7): A new hand at the pump - Confidence is rising in the oilfields      By TONY WALKER   FOR EGYPT'S oil and gas sector it has been a year of upheaval, but things appear to be settling down following the abrupt replacement last May of the long-serving oil minister, the volatile Dr Abdel Hadi Qandil, by Mr Hamdi el-Banbi, a low-key technocrat. The new minister of Petroleum and Mineral Wealth has quietly put his stamp on his ministry with a reshuffle of senior positions and a new pricing policy for crude oil exports. The new formula, which applied from October 1, sets the price of Egypt's benchmark Suez Blend crude at 60 per cent Brent minus Dollars 3.00, 20 per cent Iran Heavy minus Dollars 0.55 and 20 per cent Suez Blend spot. Mr Tarek Heggy, head of Shell in Egypt, was speaking for the industry when he observed that 'in the old days, Egyptian pricing was a dollar out on a daily basis, now its barely a dime'. Apart from bringing greater order to the daily marketing of Egyptian crude, and thus lessening friction with foreign companies, the new formula is also designed to appeal to purchasers seeking long-term contracts. Mr Banbi's initiation in his early days as minister has not been without pain, however. British Petroleum's decision to sell its 16.67 per cent stake in the Suez Oil Company (SUCO) to Repsol of Spain and to scale down its activities in Egypt was hardly a vote of confidence. But BP executives say the decision was less a reflection of the difficulties of doing business in Egypt than of the company's worldwide rationalisation to enable it to concentrate on new and perhaps more promising exploration zones. Mr Banbi, at a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo late last year, sought to place the best gloss on the BP decision, noting that big players such as Shell had come and gone in Egypt without serious effect. The new minister also foreshadowed a renewed drive to increase areas under exploration for both oil and gas after a hiatus period in the past year or so, due in part to personnel changes in the petroleum ministry and in the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). Fourteen exploration agreements were currently being processed, and there would be at least two bid rounds for new acreage this year. 'Our goal is not only to maintain our reserve base of 6bn barrels equivalent, but also to exert all efforts to increase it,' Mr Banbi said. To this end, Egypt has, since the mid-1980s, been encouraging oil companies to explore for gas. The introduction of a new gas clause has spurred efforts in that direction. Egypt's present gas reserve totals 12 trillion cubic feet (TCF). The target is 27 TCF to meet anticipated demand for the next 20 years. Dr Banbi, in his American Chamber address, described this as a 'real challenge to all involved.' He added that if companies discovered larger quantities of gas than could be absorbed by the growing domestic market, as Egypt seeks to convert as much as possible of its power sector and larger processing industries to gas use, surpluses could be exported. Shell has been particularly active in gas exploration and development. Its main production comes from its Badr al-Din deposits in the Western Desert where reserves total about 2TCF. The gas is delivered via a 270-km pipeline to al-Amiriya near Alexandria. Shell has also been among the leaders in investment in oil exploration with drilling programmes from the Gulf of Suez to the Western desert: it has made modest finds in both, including gas in the latter. It is also exploring offshore in the Mediterranean. British Gas is another foreign participant which is relatively bullish about its investments in Egypt. The company, in partnership with Yukong of South Korea and Union Pacific Petroleum Suez of the US, is committed to commercial production from its Gulf of Suez North Zafarana concession. Reserves in the British Gas concession - the first sizeable find in the Gulf of Suez for several years - are put at between 50-100m barrels, somewhat less than indicated by initial exploration. Among other noteworthy developments in the past year or so was Repsol's strong entry to the Egyptian scene. In 1990, it bought Conoco's Western Desert interests, and followed that up in 1991 with its SUCO purchase. Repsol's aggressive strategy in Egypt appears aimed at securing a reliable Mediterranean source of crude oil. Mr Banbi's elevation to minister (he was previously chairman of EGPC) was accompanied by the good news that Egypt's oil export earnings jumped by 70 per cent to Dollars 2.54bn in the year to June, due largely to the Gulf crisis.

0,FT934-2579 ,"FT934-2579 _AN-DLMDEAEIFT 931213   FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (5): Liberalisation pays off  -Latin American attracts more investors      By DAVID BATTMAN   Many oil companies are taking a renewed interest in Latin America, where the trend is towards liberalisation of oil sectors and encouragement of foreign investment. Mr John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration, confirmed recently that 'investment has come to Latin America because the resource base exists and because the countries of Latin America have established a very receptive fiscal and regulatory climate. If that situation is maintained, there is no obstacle to the fulfilment of Latin America's potential in terms of production and export capacity'. But the transformation of Latin America into a region with a unique blend of foreign private and state involvement is not yet fulfilled. It is not yet clear that the changes effected can be serve as a model for other regions seeking to expand their oil and gas sectors. Its production potential has never been in doubt. US companies in particular have long been involved in exploration and production, along with several European oil majors. The oil shocks of the 1970s and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 served as a reminder to the US of the strategic importance of alternative fuel sources, particularly when they are so much closer geographically. But political risks (in the region which invented oil nationalism) proved unacceptably high for many companies in the 1970s and 1980s. Latin America's turnaround started with the spread of economic orthodoxy which followed the debt shock of the mid-1980s. Governments sought to open up their economies to make them more competitive, reduce spending and control inflation as requirements for the restructuring of foreign debt and to secure much-needed foreign capital investments. Key aims of the oil and gas industries have been to secure foreign capital and technological injections not easily available domestically, and generally to work in partnership with the state company. Mexico and possibly Brazil are opening up some areas to foreign involvement while retaining overall control. Other main regional producers are showing greater flexibility. Partnership represents the most viable path for Latin America and potentially for other developing areas. For example, the Venezuelan Congress recently approved the development with Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi of offshore gasfields and export of LNG to the US, at an outlay of Dollars 7bn. Agreements have also been reached with Conoco and Total, Ituchi and Marubeni to produce extra heavy crude, with investment outlays of Dollars 3.5bn. Interest in exploration in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia and Argentina is currently high. The Ecuadorean government is shortly to issue exploration licences for 2.2m hectares. So far, 100 foreign oil companies have expressed interest and 50 have bought detailed documents on the Oriente (Amazon) and offshore blocks. Oil and gas pipeline contractors ware seeking to benefit from major construction projects in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. At the other extreme, Argentina in 1993 privatised its state oil company YPF. But this is unlikely to serve as a model for the rest of Latin America. Although YPF is said to be the oldest state oil company in the world, it has never been the kind of nationalist symbol that Pemex was for Mexico. Full privatisation of state oil and gas companies would, if desired, prove nigh-impossible in most countries. For this reason, Mexico insisted on retaining Pemex's privileged status when signing the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The position of Mexican President Carlos Menem is also stronger than that of most of his contemporaries. Success in attracting foreign companies will therefore depend on the terms of the contracts offered and on governments' willingness to stick to them. Latin America petroleum specialist Dr Chris Brogan says that if Latin America is to attract the finance necessary to develop its oil potential, 'it must ensure that contractual terms on offer are as good if not better than those being offered elsewhere in the world'. He adds that investors who their fingers badly burnt in the past must be convinced that contractual terms, once agreed, are not subjected to sudden, unilateral change. The need for Latin America to provide the best contracts possible becomes more acute given difficult operating conditions in many countries. Governments remain over-bureaucratic and occasionally corrupt, while exploration and production sites can be in remote areas with poor communications. There are high security risks in Colombia, where ultra-leftist guerrillas prey on the oil and gas sector, and Peru, where Shining Path guerrillas are not a beaten force. Two failed coups in 1992 in Venezuela did not directly affect the oil and gas sector but destabilised the country. In Venezuela the lead-up to the December 3 elections indicated a popular opposition to neo-liberal solutions which is likely to be echoed elsewhere in Latin America in 1994. It is unlikely that this mood change will result in attempts markedly to change oil and gas policies, though it may limit the extent to which governments such as Colombia can implement plans to make existing and future association contracts more competitive. Furthermore, the extractive industries are under pressure from environmental and indigenous groups. In Ecuador, the allocation of new oil exploration blocks in January is prompting increased controversy over the environmental impact of oil operations, particularly in Amerindian areas. Amerindian representatives began legal proceedings against Texaco in New York on November 3 in a bid to win Dollars 1.5bn-worth of compensation for environmental damage. This has implications for the region as a whole, and companies can help themselves by strict environmental controls and good relations with the grassroots in their areas of operation. In general, nothing succeeds like success. The reawakening of interest in Latin America was guaranteed in 1992 when a British Petroleum-led consortium discovered a big field in eastern Colombia, since identified as one of the Western Hemisphere's largest finds for 20 years. BP hopes to reach production of 150,000 b/d from Cusiana by the end of 1995 (this would represent a third of national production at today's levels), rising to 600,000 b/d thereafter. More such oil and gas finds would have a galvanising effect in the country concerned and sustain interest in Latin America as a whole. Under these circumstances, oil and gas companies will continue to tolerate difficult operating conditions if host governments behave supportively and avoid arbitrary actions.

Mr Mark Rayner, the CRA executive responsible for Papua New Guinea (PNG), confirmed yesterday that he had made the sale offer last week in discussions with Mr Masket Iangalio, PNG's mining and petroleum minister. Mr Rayner said CRA effectively had two conditions on any mine handover to PNG. One was that the sale would only be made to the rightful land owners and the other was that CRA retained secure exploration title to Mt Kare's hard rock mineral resource. CRA reportedly plans to offer participation in any hard rock exploration programme at Mt Kare to partners in the country's Porgera gold consortium. CRA's sale offer has come amid an intensified power struggle between more than 6,000 groups of competing land owners at Mt Kare. But reports of the offer in the Australian press on Monday brought a stinging response last night from Mr Paias Wingti, PNG prime minister. Mr Wingti accused 'vested interests' of starting a media campaign aimed at diverting his government from a review of 'iniquitous agreements' over the country's mineral resources. 'The activities of one or two of the major Australian-based interests here now in Papua New Guinea in seeking to divide or disadvantage our people over resource projects amount to a threat to our sovereignty,' Mr Wingti said. 'CRA and Placer should be comfortable in this country as long as they have a long-term commitment and are not here to rip profits out quickly and leave just as quickly,' he said.

0,FT921-9198 ,"FT921-9198 _AN-CBMA5ACUFT 920213   FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Latin America 'to double investment'      By CHRISTINA LAMB      RIO DE JANEIRO   LATIN AMERICA is expected to double its annual investments in the petroleum industry over the next four years, taking advantage of new flows of foreign capital into the region. Mr Alvaro Teixeira, Secretary General of the Association of Latin American State Petroleum companies, said yesterday that new investments in exploration and production between 1992 and 1996 are likely to total Dollars 75bn, an annual average of Dollars 18.75bn, not including the petrochemical sector. This compares with Dollars 8bn invested in 1990 and Dollars 9bn last year. The major part will come from Venezuela, the region's biggest producer, which is embarking on a series of joint ventures, followed by Mexico and Brazil, which has an ambitious programme to become self-sufficient by 1994. Latin America has the world's second largest oil reserves after the Middle East and is at present responsible for 12 per cent of global production. According to Mr Teixeira the new investment drive will increase the region's production from 7.4m barrels per day to 10m b/d by the end of the decade. He said: 'Latin American reserves have increased 600 per cent over the last 25 years - more than any other region in the world. The potential of new discoveries is still very high because the area is still little explored'. Mr Teixeira described the petroleum sector as 'one of the engines of growth of Latin America', which could 'benefit greatly from the region's re-entry into the international financial community'. He said it could be an essential tool for integration, adding that several countries including Brazil and Mexico were negotiating with Cuba for offshore exploration rights and shared use of terminals and refineries.

He said an Australian energy mission will visit Manila in  May  to coincide with the first meeting of the proposed joint working  group on energy.    ""We expect it (mission) to find a lot of trade opportunities  for Australia... and provide opportunities for the Philippines  to take initiatives to resolve its energy situation,"" McMullan  told reporters at the airport before leaving Manila on Saturday  [19 March].    The trade official arrived on Thursday as part of a tour of  member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  and is to visit Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.    Australia had been helping the Philippines in the oil  exploration field.    Only recently, the Australian Government financed the survey  work on several prospective oil-bearing structures in the  Philippines .    The first report on the results of the survey was released  last month and pointed to the areas where oil reserves could  have accumulated over the years.    The drilling season is set to start next month and several  local and foreign oil exploration companies will be searching  for oil in offshore Palawan, Mindoro, and the Sulu Sea.    The Philippines depends on imported crude. Recent oil  discoveries have helped cut these imports. One of the country's  biggest oil strikes, the Linapacan oil field off Palawan,  initially produced at least 15,000 barrels a day until water  started to seep into the pipe.    Two foreign firms -- Shell Exploration and Occidental  Petroleum -- are working on the development of a much bigger oil  structure called the Malampaya field. This structure contains a  sizable amount of natural gas and crude oil.     "

In contrast, the State has proposed two separate standards for individual civil and criminal penalties. Under the State proposal, a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by the corporate permittee if the individual knowingly caused the violation. In comparison, under the State proposal, a corporate director, officer, or agent is subject to individual civil penalties if that individual commits a violation ``willfully''     or     ``negligently.''  Although North Dakota and OSM use some of the same terms in describing their standards for the imposition of individual civil and criminal penalties, the terms are not defined the same in the State program as they are in the Federal program. For example, the Federal definition of the term ``knowingly'' at 30 CFR 846.5 reads as follows:         ``Knowingly'' means that an individual knew or had reason to know in authorizing, ordering or carrying out an act or omission on the part of a corporate permittee that such act or omission constituted a violation, failure or refusal.         In addition, the Federal definition of the term ``willfully'' at 30 CFR 846.5 reads as follows:         ``Willfully'' means that an individual acted  (1) Either intentionally, voluntarily or consciously, and  (2) With intentional disregard or plain indifference to legal requirements in authorizing, ordering or carrying out a corporate permittee's action or omission that constituted a violation, failure or refusal.         After conducting an independent review and analysis, the Director agrees with North Dakota that its proposed standards for the imposition of individual civil and criminal penalties appear to be more stringent than the Federal standards. Pursuant to section 505(b) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations.

Accordingly, the Director is approving North Dakota's proposed definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,'' and ``negligently'' and that portion of North Dakota's Criminal Code at section 12.10202 that contains those definitions, as incorporated at NDAC 43020105, as part of North Dakota's coal exploration program.

Essotier also insists that there are large reserves in  Yemen,  but conceded that the area's secrets cannot be known until  additional information is available. He says: ""We are continuing  to work on an active program of exploration in the concession  area granted to us, where we can produce some oil. We still  expect to test small setups. We are working hard and actively to  complete this, because these wells are close to our existing  facilities.""    In view of the fact that the drop in oil prices is  negatively  affecting the budget earmarked for exploration, the Canadian  company is not at present pushing to find large discoveries in  the remote parts of their concession area, which totals 37,500  square km [sq km]. Rather, it is concentrating on the smaller  discoveries, which can be incorporated economically into the  existing facilities.    It is worth mentioning that the oil fields and facilities  belonging to the Canadian company are located in the al-Masilah  region in Southern Yemen.    These facilities are connected by a 138 km pipeline south to  the port of al-Shuhayr on the coast of the Gulf of Aden.    The Canadian partner announced that, since the start of  production in September 1993, its concession area has produced  546 million barrels of oil. Production has reached an average of  135,000 barrels per day [bpd], i.e., one-third of Yemen's oil  production.    Despite Essotier's doubts that his company's production from  its producing fields will increase very much in the coming year,  he expressed optimism regarding increased oil discoveries in his  company's concession area. He said: ""There are still good  quantities, particularly in the lower strata,"" referring to the  fact that solid rock bases are located under the higher  limestone formations, where oil is usually found. He added: ""We  have one well that produces 8,000 bpd of excellent quality oil  in a natural smooth, stable flow. This indicates a broad area,  some of which is connected with others, which encourages us to  continue our activities.""    In a related development, the Canadian company is exchanging  data with other companies that control nearby concession areas,  especially with the Clyde, Lasmo, and Nimeyer companies, active  to the north and northeast of the al-Masilah fields.    With regard to the Canadian company's discoveries, those  active in the oil business think that there is a not  inconsiderable amount of oil there, but they have so far been  unable to find conclusive evidence. In April 1993, the Total  Company announced the discovery of a field that could yield  12,000 bpd, located east of al-Masilah. North of al-Masilah, the  Clyde Company is currently evaluating results, after the recent  discovery of a field located close to the Canadian company's  concession.    It is said that Lasmo has so far dug three wells in which  nothing was found, while the Nimeyer Company has just begun to  implement its digging program.    With the diminishing possibily of finding major quantities  of  oil, the oil companyies, in order to assure economic  feasibility, will be obliged to gradually intensify their  exploration programs and concentrate their efforts on small  discoveries close to their present facilities.    Nevertheless, workers in the oil business insist that even  these modest exploration efforts might be economically  unfeasible, in view of the existing agreements with the Yemeni  Government, which stipulate participation in production.

The musical about him,  ""Symmes' Hole,"" at the Odyssey, is hollow.    Symmes (1780-1829) was an Army captain (War of 1812), farmer and half-baked  amateur scientist. He concluded there were holes at the North and South poles,  leading into the warmer recesses of the earth.    According to the program notes, Symmes' ""declaration of a hollow earth in 1818  . . . ultimately led to a public campaign for the first government-sponsored  scientific expedition"" -- an 1838 endeavor that supposedly discovered  Antarctica, among other feats.    Actually, most sources credit the discovery of Antarctica to three explorers  who saw it in 1820. If the accuracy standards are this lax in the program  notes, imagine what they're like in the musical itself.    Not that accuracy of this kind should matter very much. But except for the  fruits of the expedition that Symmes purportedly inspired, author Randy  Dreyfuss hasn't come up with a reason for us to care about Symmes. In fact,  it's not clear that Dreyfuss himself really cares about Symmes.    The tone of the show is steadfastly trivial and/or cartoonlike. It's supposed  to be a whimsical examination of a cockeyed American dreamer; instead it's a  labored look at a remote character who seems not much more than a buffoon. His  story might be interesting as a footnote in a history book, but it's hardly  worthy of treatment in a full-length musical.    At first the low comedy is mildly amusing. Some of the jokes are so bad they're  good. But gradually, as it becomes apparent that there isn't much of anything  else inside this show, they become merely bad.    The first act attempts to stir up some lyricism over the notion of one man's  unrelenting quest for knowledge, and the second act attempts to make a  statement about the little guy being used by the greedy big guys.    But the strained rhymes and the self-congratulatory lines that dot the lyrics  undercut these efforts. The music is equally fussy and forgettable, and Mark  Reina's choreography adds little more than clutter to Carol Corwen's staging.    Nor does the performance of Albert Macklin as Symmes deepen our sympathy for  this guy. He looks perpetually wild-eyed, as if he's half-mad. He doesn't age,  so we don't appreciate that his was a long-term crusade. And some of his lyrics  are lost, even though it's a small house.    Orson Bean gamely goes through a kind of vaudeville-act-with-big-words as  Symmes' loyal disciple. Craig Zehms plays two smoothie roles smoothly, Lori  Michael vamps around the stage as Symmes' fertile Myrtle of a wife, and Tom  Dugan, Thom McCleister and Kevin Pariseau contribute a gallery of subsidiary  roles.    For a show that's supposed to be about our ability to imagine new worlds, Don  Llewelyn's set and Doc Ballard's lighting are awfully drab and earthbound. Neal  San Teguns did most of the costumes, but not the one that provides the best  sight gag of the show: a ""planet suit"" worn by Bean at a scientific  demonstration and credited in the program to Carlos Leon.

0,FT923-11397 ,"FT923-11397 _AN-CGXAXAFRFT 920724   FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Weak demand hits US oil groups      By ALAN FRIEDMAN      NEW YORK   EXXON, the largest US oil and gas company, and Texaco, the third ranked company, yesterday reported lower second-quarter net earnings as the squeeze on petroleum product margins and weak demand continued to take a toll on the US energy industry. The Texas-based Exxon suffered a 15.1 per cent drop in second-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 955m. This is the lowest quarterly net profit for the company since 1989, the year of the Alaskan oil spill from the Exxon Valdez. Exxon's earnings per share were down to 76 cents from 90 cents a year ago. Revenues in the quarter were 1.8 per cent higher at Dollars 27.76bn. For the first six months of 1992 Exxon's net income was down by 31.5 per cent at Dollars 2.3bn, on revenues that were 4 per cent lower at Dollars 55.67bn. Texaco of White Plains, New York, said its second-quarter net income was Dollars 245m, a decline of 8.9 per cent. Earnings per share were 85 cents, against 94 cents in 1991. Revenues were 4.4 per cent higher at Dollars 9.4bn. For the first half of 1992 Texaco's net earnings were 34.9 per cent lower at Dollars 445m, on revenues that were 6.3 per cent down at Dollars 18bn. The second-quarter net profit at Occidental Petroleum, based in Los Angeles, was nearly halved - from Dollars 147m, or 49 cents a share, a year ago to Dollars 75m, or 25 cents. Revenues were Dollars 2.2bn, against Dollars 2.4bn. For the first six months Occidental, undergoing a substantial restructuring programme, suffered a 38.7 per cent drop in net income, to Dollars 173m. Revenues were down to Dollars 4.3bn from Dollars 5.2bn in the first half of 1991. The drop in earnings at these companies continues a trend started on Wednesday, when Amoco, the fifth largest US oil and gas company, reported a 22.5 per cent fall in underlying second-quarter earnings and a Dollars 478m net loss after taking an Dollars 805m charge for restructuring and severance payment costs. Mr Lawrence Rawl, Exxon's chairman, said the group's performance was affected by lower petroleum product margins, which were in turn affected by rising crude supply costs, weak economic conditions and soft demand in many markets. Earnings from exploration and production operation were Dollars 83m higher at Dollars 725m while income from the refining and marketing side slumped by Dollars 352m to Dollars 180m, due mainly to problems in the US market. Included in the second-quarter results was a Dollars 75m charge for restructuring Exxon's US oil and gas businesses. The tendency of energy companies to direct exploration spending away from the US was illustrated by Exxon's devoting 70 per cent of its worldwide capital and exploration expenditures to projects outside the US. Mr James Kinnear, chief executive of Texaco, stressed the company's effort to maintain the strength of its financial position in the face of generally weak industry conditions. He said Texaco expected to produce full-year cash savings of around Dollars 700m from reductions in planned capital spending and expenses. On Wall Street, Exxon's share price closed Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 63; Texaco's price improved Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 1/2 ; and Occidental's price was Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 19 5/8 .

0,FT922-2188 ,"FT922-2188 _AN-CFRBNAC0FT 920618   FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed feelings on Indonesian oil - Industry executives are down in the mouth      By WILLIAM KEELING   THE INDONESIAN oil sector is proving the adage that there are two sides to every story. Government officials are celebrating a record number of production sharing contracts signed with foreign oil companies. But at the same time the executives of the latter are looking increasingly down in the mouth about the industry's future in Indonesia. 'Something doesn't add up,' explained one company executive, head in hands. The figures compiled by government give the industry a rosy hue. Government officials say 22 production sharing contracts were signed last year, and a total of 61 in the last four years, more than during the most active periods of exploration in the 1960s and early 1980s. There have also been higher levels of seismic work: 84,000 sq km in 1990, more than double the average for the past 15 years. Such a level has not been reached since the initial broad seismic mapping of Indonesia between 1969-1972. With only 36 of Indonesia's 60 known basins so far explored, the country would appear to hold great potential. Talk to some of the oil companies, however, and a very different picture emerges. The last block to have reserves discovered in excess of 100m barrels was awarded in 1971, officials say. Production is dominated by seven large fields, some of which are reaching maturity. The majority of Indonesia's fields, however, are small and discoveries have not kept pace with demand. Oil executives say the level of drilling relative to the number of new contracts of work is low. In 1990 actual exploration and development expenditure of Dollars 1.26bn fell short of budgeted levels by Dollars 90m. The companies believe last year also saw an expenditure shortfall and that the government's target of 176 exploration wells a year, necessary for maintaining existing proven reserves, estimated at 10.9bn barrels, is not being met. Government officials say new technology may boost recoverable reserves and estimate that there are 20bn barrels with 'proven ultimate recovery'. However, neither enhanced recovery nor the assigning of new contract areas are expected to arrest a decline in output. The World Bank estimates current production (including condensate) at 1.6m b/d, but expects this to decline to 1.35m b/d by the turn of the century. With domestic consumption of about 520,000 b/d last year and increasing by at least 6 per cent a year, government officials concede that Indonesia will become a net importer of oil by 2005 and will have to leave the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Some industry officials believe the day of reckoning may be as early as 1997. Some of the problems facing the industry are intractable. The bulk of Indonesia's proven reserves lie in the western half of the archipelago where past exploration has been most intense. The future lies in the pioneer country of the Timor Gap and the seas and islands between Sulawesi and Irian Jaya. The geological structure of the area, however, is immensely complex - twisted rock formations crushed between two converging continental shelves. Potential fields are likely to be small and, even with three-dimensional seismic technology, the search for them will be a hit-and-miss affair. On the land mass of Irian Jaya, building pipelines from the interior to enable the export of production would be hugely expensive. Oil companies admit that tapping the oil fields of countries of the former Soviet Union is likely to divert funds from Indonesia for the immediate future. The problem is compounded, they say, by an industry wide shortage of funds. ""Indonesia is getting a smaller share of a diminishing pool of finance,' one executive explained. The situation is worsened, he says, by contract terms which, particularly in relation to tax structure, are amongst the toughest in the world. Government officials discount many of the oil companies' complaints as simple posturing. They say conditions for deep water and pioneer areas have been relaxed and point to the high number of new contracts as evidence of the oil companies' commitment to Indonesia. The contracts, however, may be at the heart of the industry's problems. Whilst their conditions remain tough, the contracts have commited companies to relatively low levels of exploration; under the 45 contracts signed between 1987-1990, companies agreed to spend Dollars 2.8bn over a six to ten year period. The contracts have opened up new areas for exploration, but the financial commitments of the companies are unlikely to be adequate for the task. The contracts will prove difficult to renegotiate should the government wish to boost exploration and it may rue the decision to sign so many contracts so quickly. Company executives admit, however, that the government may yet get the last laugh. 'The oil companies have proven to be poor negotiators in the past. The Indonesians have tended to get the better of us,' one executive admitted. It need only take one big discovery to prove the government right.  The Financial Times   London Page 38  "

The chief executives of the two companies said yesterday that the agreement 'effectively realises many of the benefits' identified during last year's abortive merger talks. Final details of the pact are expected to be completed soon. It includes development of the Deep and Lower Post ore body adjacent to Barrick's Goldstrike mine, as well as exploration and development along common property boundaries, and sharing of Newmont's bioleaching technology. The Post body straddles the border between the two companies' properties and contains an estimated 9m troy ounces of gold. Barrick has agreed to expand its existing Betze pit at Goldstrike to include Deep and Lower Post. The expanded pit will be known as the Betze-Post pit. Stripping of the expanded area is due to start next year, and mining of most of the Deep and Lower Post ore will begin in 1997. Mining of the Post body will also give access to 580,000 ounces of gold from near-surface material on Newmont land. Until now, neither company has shown gold from the Deep and Lower Post body in its production forecasts. Newmont owns 5m ounces of the Post deposit, while Barrick's share is about 4m ounces. The companies plan to share the costs of mining the Deep and Lower Post reserves in proportion to benefits received. Production costs will thus be the same for both companies. They said that an agreement for joint exploration and sharing of data will enable 'rapid and economic development' of new discoveries along common boundaries.  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "

Repsol said it was delighted with the results, 'particularly if one compares them with the rest of the sector'. Operating profits fell nearly Pta10bn to Pta119.8bn, while cash-flow, after tax, fell 10.4 per cent to Pta154.06bn. The Spanish government is planning to place up to 40m shares in Repsol - roughly 13.3 per cent of the group - with institutions in the Spanish and international markets before the end of May. The flotation could raise close to Dollars 1bn and, if fully used, will reduce the state's holding from 54.5 per cent to just over 40 per cent. Repsol said it had managed to squeeze the most out of a difficult year thanks to good returns on some recent investments and the impact of a tough cost reduction programme. The group had shed nearly 2,000 jobs over the year, bringing the workforce to 19,632 people. It posted a 77 per cent increase in operating profits to Pta18.6bn in its exploration and production division thanks, it said, to exploration successes and to a 20 per cent increase in crude production. As expected, however, Repsol's troubled chemicals division continued to suffer along with the rest of the international chemicals industry, losing Pta7.9bn after making a meagre operating profit of Pta1.2bn in 1991. The Repsol refining and marketing division saw operating income fall more than 16 per cent to Pta86.6bn partly because of new accounting rules, partly because it is having to shed service stations belonging to the Campsa group under EC monopoly rules and, lastly, because of tighter margins for refined products in international markets.

Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said British-Borneo had had 'a hell of a year. I think we have now come of age.' The company increased its oil and gas revenues by 56 per cent to Pounds 28m. Mr Gaynor said British-Borneo had maintained its exploration success rate of 40 per cent for the third consecutive year. It intended in the current year to step up investment in exploration, particularly in the US, from about Dollars 18m a year to up to Dollars 30m. The changes to the petroleum revenue tax introduced in the last budget had made the North Sea a less attractive option. Exploration costs were some four times higher as a result, Mr Gaynor said. British-Borneo had doubled investment in the US to about Dollars 9m in the year just ended, helping it to benefit from the 15 per cent increase in the average US gas price during the year. Part of the revenue improvement was due to becoming an operator, as opposed to being a hands-off investor, for the first time, Mr Gaynor said. British-Borneo was beginning to see opportunites to build up its oil assets in light of the weak price. Any acquisitions and investments would be funded through cash flow, Mr Gaynor said. Income from the group's portfolio of oil and gas investments fell from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 5.4m. However, the group realised some Pounds 4.3m from the portfolio which ended the year with a market value of Pounds 19.3m. The dividend was maintained at 4.433p, for a steady total of 7.1p.

The company also benefited from improved product margins in Latin America and cost-cutting. Excluding charges of Dollars 300m for accounting changes last year, first-quarter earnings rose 20 per cent to Dollars 278m, or 97 cents a share, from Dollars 232m, or 80 cents. The company reported a net loss of Dollars 68m, or 36 cents, in the 1992 quarter, including the charges. Revenues slipped to Dollars 8.5bn in the first three months of 1993, from Dollars 8.6bn the previous year. On Wall Street, shares in Texaco firmed Dollars  3/4 to stand at Dollars 63 5/8 at the close. Mr Alfred DeCrane, who recently replaced Mr James Kinnear as chief executive, said: 'Texaco has been able to contain its costs and expenses and maintain its operational competitiveness through improvements in its business processes.' Higher prices for crude oil and natural gas, and lower operating expenses, helped Texaco's operating earnings from domestic exploration and production soar to Dollars 133m, from Dollars 86m a year ago. Earnings from US manufacturing and marketing fell to Dollars 53m, from Dollars 78m last year, reflecting a glut of supply which depressed refinery margins on the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast. In contrast, Texaco's west coast operations had improved margins. International exploration and production profits slipped to Dollars 79m in the 1993 quarter, from Dollars 102m. Last year's earnings benefited from currency gains of Dollars 29m from lower UK deferred taxes. Stronger margins in Latin America and the Caltex operating area lifted Texaco's international manufacturing and marketing earnings to Dollars 123m from Dollars 81m.

Elf will hold two-thirds of the joint company, Elf Enterprise Petroleum, and Enterprise a third. The agreement involves the transfer of part of Enterprise's stake in the large North Sea Nelson oilfield to the joint venture company. In return, Elf will reduce its 25 per cent stake in Enterprise to 10 per cent. The shares will be distributed via an issue of Pounds 438m of exchangeable bonds to finance the acquisition. The bonds are issued by Elf but convert into Enterprise shares. Further financing of Pounds 347m for the asset purchase will initially be provided by Elf. Enterprise will assume one-third of the burden when it becomes a shareholder in the new company. The Occidental interests bought by the new venture include 23.4 per cent of the Claymore field and 36.5 per cent of the Scapa field. The deal also includes 36.5 per cent of the Flotta oil pipeline and terminal in the Orkney Islands. In addition, the sale involves a 36.5 per cent interest in the Piper B, Saltire A and Chanter fields which are under development, as well as a wide spread of exploration acreage. The new venture will hold 19 per cent of the Nelson oilfield.

Premier is negotiating with Amerada Hess, the US oil and gas exploration group, to buy the shares it has held since 1987. As part of a possible deal, Amerada would trade its holding for a stake in Premier and subscribe for further shares to a maximum of 25 per cent. Last night, Mr John Lander, Pict managing director, said: 'We have been notified by Amerada Hess of their discussions with Premier, but as such we have not had any approach.' He refused to comment further on any ramifications of an offer from Premier. Premier said that any offer would be made on the basis of the group's relative share prices at the close of trading last Friday. Pict shares were then 141p, while Premier stood at 21 1/2 p. Premier added: 'Any offer for Pict is unlikely to value the company at a significant premium to that price.' Yesterday, Pict shares closed 14p up at 155p, valuing the company at Pounds 80m, while Premier shares finished 1 1/2 p up at 23p. Analysts said that at this level of valuation, an all-paper offer would probably involve about seven Premier shares for every one Pict, giving Amerada a stake of about 24 per cent in Premier. In the event of an offer, the US group would pay 30p a share to increase its stake to the 25 per cent ceiling. Mr Iain Reid, oil analyst at SG Warburg, said: 'At this price, this deal does not reflect the upside in Pict's drilling programme.

0,FT933-292 ,"FT933-292 _AN-DI2CRAGOFT 930929   FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (13): Oil industry revives - Liberalised petrol prices help investment      By DAVID PILLING   RUSTING PIPES, broken-down pumps and disintegrating infrastructure have for years been the physical signs of Peru's declining oil industry. From the eastern jungles to the coastal desert of the north-west it is a picture of decay. Production dwindled from a peak of 71.4m barrels in 1980 to below 40m barrels in 1991, and proven reserves slumped from 900m barrels to less than 400m. But, as in the mining sector, there are signs of a reversal of fortunes. Production of crude petroleum rose one per cent last year to 115,000 b/d, and the government expects a rise of about 10 per cent in 1993 to 127,000 b/d, or 46.5m barrels over the year. Much of that results from increased production at Occidental Petroleum of the US, which has recently committed itself to investing more than Dollars 30m in new exploration after settlement of a long-running payments dispute with state-owned oil concern Petro Peru. The financial situation of Petro Peru itself has been made healthier by the August 1990 liberalisation of petrol prices, which has provided a greater profit incentive for investment in maintenance and exploration for new reserves. Eventually the government intends to privatise the state group, which may be split into as many as 40 operating units. Changing attitudes to the petroleum industry have been consolidated in a new hydrocarbons law which seeks to make Peru more attractive to foreign investors. Companies, whose exploration and production contracts will be on a surer footing, will market their oil output as they see fit. Restrictions on exploring within 30 miles of Peruvian frontiers have also been lifted. 'The new law is very sound,' says Mr Roger Alderson, general manager at Great Western Resources of Houston. 'It simplifies the old regulations, replacing 33 separate statutes. Now, probably for the first time ever, Peruvians have accepted that they need foreign investment.' It looks as though new attitudes may pay off. Peru, which has drilled only eight wells in the past two years against 100 in Argentina, is witnessing increased exploration. Great Western has committed Dollars 40m over four years to explore 1m hectares in the jungle, while American International Petroleum is spending at least Dollars 12m over two years on offshore drilling. Mobil Oil is currently undertaking technical evaluation of the Madre de Dios region in the southern jungle. Mr Alderson expects significant discoveries in the next few years which, he says, could easily see the restoration of 1980 output levels. There is also renewed interest in the enormous Camisea gas field in Cuzco, which has estimated reserves equivalent to 2bn barrels of oil, plus 700m barrels of condensates. Shell, which abandoned plans to develop the resource in 1988 after failure to agree terms with the Garcia government, is reported to be looking at the project again. It is estimated that Camisea would require investment of Dollars 1.8bn to harness its full potential, though it might be possible to phase in production with initial sales to the local market. In the hydrocarbons sector generally, smaller petroleum companies have so far shown more interest in Peruvian investments than their larger counterparts, a pattern seen in neighbouring Colombia. However, in an annual survey of international oil companies conducted earlier this year by Simon Petroleum Technology, Peru jumped to 17th on the world list of attractive investment propositions. Three years ago it stood at 37. Mr Alderson believes it could climb as high as eighth by next year. 'There used to be - and still is to a certain extent - enormous trepidation about coming to Peru,' he says. 'But now it appears that the country is turning the corner.'

0,FT922-12745 ,"FT922-12745 _AN-CDOBJAGNFT 920415   FT  15 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mali hopes for return of golden age - One of the great unexplored gold prospects      By ALASTAIR GUILD   GOLD MADE the ancient empire of Mali one of the richest in the world. And now, six centuries later, West Africa is seen by mining companies as one of the world's great unexplored gold prospects. Carbon dating of pottery fragments found in ancient workings at Syama in the far south of Mali, near the border with the Ivory Coast, indicate that oxide ore was worked 740-400 years ago. BHP Minerals International, the first major exploration and production company to establish a presence in the region's gold fields, is negotiating with the Malian government before making a final decision on an additional Dollars 70m investment in Syama. Syama will yield 2.5 tonnes of gold this year and is expected to produce 3 tonnes for the next two years. Then, the company, which up to now has been shifting dirt, will hit hard rock. The new investment will extend the life of the main open cast mine, 1 km long and 330 metres across, by up to 20 years, while exploratory drills at a further half a dozen satellite sites have indicated promising reserves. Total reserves at Syama have been estimated at 80 tonnes. The Australian-based multinational is investing a further Dollars 5.5m a year on minerals exploration in West Africa as a whole, and in Mali, Ghana and the Ivory Coast in particular. BHP, among the world's largest minerals companies, has already invested Dollars 40m in the pit in the three years since the signing of the exploration agreement. The initial lease covered an area of 1,500 sq km, now slightly reduced. The production agreement covers 20 sq km. The average concentration of gold is currently 3.1 grams per tonne of ore. But each day 13,000 tonnes of dirt is excavated from the main pit, of which only 3,000 tonnes is processed through the mill. 'To justify our investment in management and infrastructure in West Africa, BHP has to plan for a series of productive sites in the region,' says Mr Daniel Johnson, mine manager at Syama. 'Syama is of huge significance for Mali as its first, and so far only, large scale commercial venture into gold mining using modern techniques. But for BHP it has to be seen in the context of a turnover last year of Dollars 10bn.' Syama by itself is also small in a regional context. For Mali, it represents 6 per cent of GDP. In Ghana, it would be considered a small to medium-sized operation. Nevertheless, Mali is believed to have considerable, as yet unexplored potential, similar to that of Ghana. Mali has been bypassed by the major exploration companies, partly because of the difficulties of detecting deposits, generally covered by thick layers of laterite. Its poor infrastructure has been another factor  - for example, industrial consumers pay 5 cents per kw hour for electricity in Ghana compared with 25 cents in Mali. The gold has to be transported long distances as Mali is landlocked  - BHP flys it first to Bamako, then to Brussels, and finally to Geneva. Mali's government ministries have been considered to be among the least well-informed in the region. But things are changing. The United Nations Development Programme recently completed an Dollars 8m, 12-year project to give the country its own centre of expertise in minerals. UNDP's first involvement in Mali's mineral sector dates back to 1979, when it located early traces of mining. That provided the justification for heavier involvement in exploration, and training of Malians. It was during this phase that the Syama deposit was uncovered. During the follow up, UNDP and the UN Department for Technical Co-operation for Development, helped the Malian government negotiate and finalise the agreement with BHP. The Malians struck what appears to be a favourable deal at Syama, and it is one they are already starting to tighten up. In future, the government is expected to take 6 per cent royalties, and a 20 per cent stake. Taxation on profits will be levied at 45 per cent. UNDP soon realised that the Malians themselves could take care of some exploration at least. It financed teams to provide on-the-job training, equipment for a geochemical laboratory and assistance with drilling. PDRM  - the Programme pour le Developement de Resources Minerales  - has already carried out contracts for analytical work, drilling, digging shafts and the analysis of geological samples. Minerals experts believe that Mali will now benefit considerably from an aerial geophysical data set for the south and west of the country as a back-up to surface mapping carried out by the Belgians, French and the UN, much of it from the 1960s. BHP is itself concerned to transfer as much expertise as possible to Malians. For example, it already has ten West African exploration geologists working in the region. The company expects to start making a net return on its Syama investment by the end of this next year. Operating costs at Syama are thought to be in the range of Dollars 200 to Dollars 250 a troy ounce, while the gold price has fallen from over Dollars 400 to Dollars 340 an ounce since Syama went into full scale production last year. The feasibility study, on which the Syama investment was based, assumed a price of Dollars 400 an ounce at 1988 exchange rates. Elsewhere in Mali, the French Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres has a concession on a deposit at Loulo, the west of the country. Here it is negotiating a joint venture with the government and an as yet undisclosed third party. These beds contain some 30 tonnes of gold to a depth of 100 metres, with between five and 10 grams of gold to every tonne of ore. Mali will be hoping that it turns out to be more successful than its first joint venture. The Kalana mine, which has gold reserves of 30 tonnes, and the first large scale deposit to be exploited, was opened in 1984 and mined with Soviet assistance. Officially, it was producing about 2 tonnes of gold a year. It has just closed, amid rumours that much of the production bypassed official channels and was shared out by the country's now disgraced former president, Moussa Traore, ousted in a coup in March last year, and the Soviets. Most of what was left is said to have been exchanged by the government for Soviet military hardware, much of it now useless with no-one to service it or provide spare parts since the end of Soviet expansionism in Africa.

The Montreal Protocol is an international agreement on the  protection of ozone layer which filters the harmful ultraviolet  rays from reaching the earth's surface.    K.M. Sarma, Coordinator of the Ozone Secretariat, told  participants at the Preparatory Meeting of the Fifth Meeting of  the Parties to the Montreal Protocol--which opened in Bangkok  yesterday--that contributions to the Multilateral Fund are still  behind pledges.    Speaking on behalf of the Executive Director of the United  Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Mr. Sarma urged the  Governments of the countries which ``could pay but did not pay''  to make their contributions as soon as possible.    Mr. Phonthep, in his opening speech, said the provision of  adequate funding is important to developing countries  constrained by their technologies and financial resources in  eliminating the production and consumption of ozone-destroying  chemicals.    Thailand is listed in the so-called Article 5 Paragraph 1  countries which are eligible for financial assistance from the  Multilateral Fund for projects to phase out the use of  substances that damage the ozone layer.    Mr. Phonthep said the Thai Government has already taken  various measures to discourage the use of such substances,  including promoting public awareness on the danger of ozone  destruction and encouraging people to help save the ozone.    Mr. Sarma said the requirements of the Multilateral Fund for  1994, 1995 and 1996 are a vital issue of discussion at the  Bangkok meeting.    According to Mr. Sarma, it has already been agreed that the  requirement for the next three years will be between U.S. $340  and $500 million.    He stressed this requirement must be met so developing  countries can achieve their goals of phasing out their use of  ozone damaging substances as early as posslble.    ``The less cash we put in now, the more the consumption of  the developing countries will increase.''    ``And ultimately it is the contributors to the Fund who have  to bear the burden of the cost of phasing out a much larger  quantity of the controlled substances,'' he said.    Mr. Sarma said although there have been reports that the  Montreal Protocol is working splendidly and that the extent of  chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a chief ozone-eating agent, is  coming down as control measures take effect, he still did not  want the people to be complacent.    ``This is not the time to pat ourselves on the back and  assume that we have succeeded in our task,'' he said.    Mr. Sarma said the news about the ozone layer continues to  be  depressing.    In 1992, the Antarctic hole was at its largest and ozone has  been depleted by 60 percent. The destruction was also  significant in the northern latitudes.    In 1993, the record low ozone values over Antarctica  reported  in September were the lowest ever reported for that month.    These values have continued into early October, he said.     "
0,FT933-8945 ,"FT933-8945 _AN-DHLCDAFAFT 930812   FT  12 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway digs deeper for North Sea riches - The improving prospects for Europe's largest oil producer      By KAREN FOSSLI   NORWAY has reached midlife as a petroleum resource nation but the estimated reserves in its oil fields have been upgraded, thanks to new seismic acquisition and interpretation technology. The technology has also have helped identify new fields outside the mature North Sea province. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), the industry watchdog, upgraded its estimates of total recoverable petroleum resources by 12 per cent to between 8bn and 12.5bn tonnes of oil equivalent. At current prices some estimates put the value of the upgrade at around NKr450bn (Dollars 225bn). The NPD's estimate puts undiscovered resources at 3.7bn tonnes, the potential for improved recovery from existing fields at 500m tonnes and discovered recoverable resources at 5.6bn tonnes. The oil/gas ratio of potential new resources and improved recovery is respectively 40 per cent and 60 per cent. In the past Norwegian petroleum resources have been upgraded by an average of about 30 per cent from original estimates. Given average annual oil production of 80m tonnes and annual gas production of 25m tonnes of oil equivalent, the country's oil will last for about 45 years and its gas for about 200 years. Norway is western Europe's biggest crude oil producer, with an annual output of 2.4m barrels It is the third-biggest supplier of gas. The continental shelf embraces an estimated 1.1m sq km of sedimentary rocks, of which just 40 per cent has been opened for exploration drilling. The shelf is divided into three areas; the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. The North Sea comprises all areas south of the 62nd parallel, while the Norwegian Sea extends to intermediate areas between the North Sea and the Barents Sea, which comprises areas north of Andoeya in the Lofoten Islands. The NPD says that on average, every third wildcat well drilled on the shelf has produced hydrocarbons when tested. In the North Sea, for example, 320 structures have been drilled and 112 discovery wells defined. For the Norwegian Sea the respective numbers are 70 structures and 17 discoveries, while in the Barents Sea the figures are respectively 45 and 16. 'During the last five years resource growth has been slightly less than production growth. Although we can no longer expect to find as much oil as we produce, good opportunities will still exist for further interesting oil finds,' the NPD. says Norway's first licensing round was held in 1965, when 23 production licences covering 80 blocks were issued, all in water depths of less than 150m in the southern North Sea. Exploration in recent years has moved into water depths of 300m and is heading into depths of between 500m and 2,000m. Drilling technology has advanced to the point where it can meet deep water challenges, the NPD says. Norway's first two oil discoveries were made in 1967 and 1968. They were followed by the discovery of the prolific Ekofisk field, but not until 33 wells were drilled to confirm its commerciality. The NPD likes to tell this story as a reminder to oil companies thinking of giving up in frustration with their lack of success in the Barents Sea. Despite 25 years of intensive North Sea exploration, the NPD believes there may still be a considerable undiscovered resource potential. In the last few years several interesting small and medium-sized discoveries have been made close to existing infrastructure and in reallocated blocks undergoing renewed exploration. The NPD estimates that about 25 per cent of total North Sea resources are still awaiting discovery. Earlier this year, Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, boosted estimates of the amount of oil found in its North Sea Snorre field by 10 per cent to 890m barrels. Snorre came on stream last autumn and still faces two further stages of development. In the Norwegian Sea's Voering Basin, off the coast of mid-Norway and north of the emerging Haltenbanken oil and gas province, explorers drilled unsuccessfully for several years before three discoveries were made in 1990-92. The NPD estimates total Norwegian Sea resources at 1,450m tonnes of oil equivalent, of which 42 per cent is oil and 58 per cent gas. Its statistical analysis shows a 95 per cent probability of finding 200m tonnes of petroleum and a 5 per cent probability of finding 2,200m tonnes. The recently confirmed Norwegian Sea Norne field, operated by Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, is believed to contain an estimated 400m barrels of oil and the company aims to bring it on stream in 1996. 'The Norne discovery opens up the region's future potential. . . but we struggled for a long time and drilled two dry wells before we struck oil,' says Mr Kyrre Nese, Statoil's executive vice-president of exploration and development. He believes it will take another decade before sufficient exploration is undertaken in the field to reduce uncertainty over reserves potential. On Haltenbanken, Norske Shell recently announced an upgrade of Draugen oil reserves by 160m barrels to 580m. Draugen is due to come on stream later this year. Mr Einar Knutsen, a Norske Shell director, says three-dimensional surveys undertaken in 1991 and 1992 triggered the possibility that Draugen might contain more oil. 'I would not exclude the possibility of a further Draugen upgrade,' he says. Norske Shell is at present undertaking interpretative analysis of 3-D surveys of two blocks south of Draugen with a view to commencing exploration drilling next year to define the prospects. Mr Knutsen says that Statoil's Norne discovery is encouraging news but cautions that the industry will have to undertake years of drilling to gain sufficient knowledge of the region to be confident over its resource potential. 'Excluding Norne, there have been no other discoveries in the region,' he says, adding that his company will concentrate on maximising recovery from Draugen and defining the prospects of blocks 6411 and 6412. In the vast Barents Sea, Norway has found gas but made no commercial oil discoveries. In the Russian part of the Barents Sea, Shtokmanovskoye, believed to be the world's biggest offshore gas field, was discovered five years ago. The Russians also found oil there. In mid-August Norske Shell will drill the only well to be drilled this year in the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea. 'We have expectations, but this is a crucial well. If it is dry it will mean Shell has reached a crossroads in its commitment to the Barents Sea,' Mr Knutsen says. Mr Nese says the main challenge for Barents Sea explorers is to develop exploration models that can lead to oil discoveries. 'We know there is significant gas reserves there and gas marketing efforts are under way, but the area is far away from gas markets.' The NPD estimates total resources in the Barents Sea to be 1,380m tonnes of oil equivalent, of which 14 per cent is oil and 86 per cent gas.   Companies:-  Saga Petroleum.

It also unveiled plans to float a minority interest in its American subsidiary in the US. The assets are being acquired by Bridge Oil (USA), the company's existing US vehicle, which is currently 100 per cent owned by the Australian parent. They include producing natural gas and oil properties in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma, in the Texas Panhandle, and other smaller interests in Wyoming and central Texas. Bridge said that the properties currently contain about 56.8bn cu ft equivalent of net proved and probable reserves, worth ADollars 60m. The exploration acreage, costing ADollars 16m, totals about 9.2m acres in the western US, the bulk of which offers exploration rights for up to 13 years and conversion into long-term production leases if a discovery is made. The company plans to fund the deal via a mixture of cash and shares - including the delivery of a 10 per cent interest in Bridge Oil (USA) to Santa Fe Energy. The initial public offering of shares in Bridge Oil (USA), which is conditional on regulatory approvals, will involve 4m shares, and the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to fund a ADollars 67m dividend payment to Bridge Oil itself. After the flotation, it is estimated that around 28.57 per cent of Bridge Oil (USA) will be owned by the general public; 10 per cent by Santa Fe; and the remaining 61.43 per cent by the parent Bridge Oil company. Bridge Oil became involved in the US petroleum industry in 1981, expanding in the late-1980s. In January 1990, it spent ADollars 147m on a package of producing properties from USX Corporation.

Reilly called on the White House on Thursday to adopt  a policy seeking to end the use of ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the  century, according to Administration officials.    The proposal, made during a meeting of the Domestic Policy Council, came just  hours after a surprise agreement by members of the European Community to take  similar action.    If endorsed by President Bush, the move would double the pace at which  production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs -- the household  gases that are destroying the Earth's ozone layer -- would be restricted under  U.S. law.      First Step in Effort    EPA officials see the proposal as a first step in a wider effort to strengthen  the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement signed by about 40 nations  that calls for a 50% reduction in production and consumption of CFCs by 1999.    The agreement was hailed as historic when it was signed in November, 1987, but  the discovery since that time that the ozone depletion problem was far worse  than imagined has led to wide spread concern that the treaty was not  sufficiently strict.    Since the treaty was signed, scientists have reported that during part of the  year, the ozone levels in the stratosphere over Antarctica decline by nearly  50% and that the ozone layer over parts of the Northern Hemisphere have been  depleted since 1969 by as much as 6%.    In addition, scientists warned last month that accumulations of the man-made  pollutants high above the North Pole had left the ozone layer in the Arctic  stratosphere ""primed"" for destruction.    An EPA official said Thursday night that Reilly hoped for an Administration  decision on the proposal as early as today, when he leaves for London to attend  a 100-nation conference.    The talks, headed by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, will deal with  the threat to the ozone layer.    White House approval would give U.S. negotiators attending the meeting a head  start in seeking revision of the Montreal Protocol, which is due to be  officially reconsidered for the first time in May at a meeting in Helsinki.    CFCs are used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners and as  propellants in some spray cans. When in the atmosphere, they break down into  chemical components capable of destroying ozone at a rapid rate. The process is  exacerbated in the polar regions because of cold temperatures and other  meteorological characteristics.    Ozone, which is found in the stratosphere between 9 and 15 miles above the  Earth's surface, shields the planet from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.    Researchers believe that a mere 1% depletion in the ozone layer can increase  the risk of skin cancer by 4% to 5%.    At the London meeting, European and U.S. negotiators hope to persuade  less-developed nations, including China and India, to restrict their CFC  production. Neither nation has yet signed the Montreal Protocol.    But the European decision Thursday and the Reilly proposal to the White House  represent decisions by the developed nations to proceed with efforts to end CFC  production even if other nations do not follow their lead.

""China has irrefutable sovereignty over the Spratly islands  and adjacent waters and this fact enjoys full international  legal basis,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a  weekly press briefing.    ""Oil contracts between Chinese companies and foreign  countries concerning these waters is action totally within  China's sovereignty and is therefore totally legal,"" Wu said.    Hanoi reacted strongly Wednesday to what it described as the  ""illegal"" contract signed by China and Colorado-based Crestone  Energy, warning that the deal marked a ""serious escalation of  the situation in the South China Sea."" The Spratly islands are  claimed wholly or in part by China, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia,  the Philippines and Taiwan. The crux of the dispute revolves  around what are believed to be vast oil deposits in the area.    Crestone had announced Tuesday that it would sink  exploratory  wells under the protection of the Chinese Navy, which has  recently stepped up its operations around the disputed island  chain. The contract provides Crestone with access to a 25,155  square kilometer (10,062 square miles) area -- the largest ever  included in a prospecting contract in Southeast Asia.    Wu also returned Hanoi's accusations that mineral  exploration  around the Spratlys constituted a violation of Vietnamese  sovereignty. ""In recent years, Vietnam has carried out a lot of  oil and gas exploration in Chinese waters. These activities are  illegal and encroach upon China's sovereignty,"" Wu said.    Historical enemies China and Vietnam normalised diplomatic  relations in November 1991 after a 12-year freeze, agreeing at  the time to peacefully settle border disputes through  negotiations. But mutual suspicion and allegations of violating  bilateral understandings have continued to strain relations,  with rival claims to the Spratly and Paracel islands the main  point of contention.

R. 645201110 and 645201120 to provide that only coal exploration operations on lands which are not subject to 43 CFR parts 34803487 will be regulated by the Division is thus an appropriate limitation on the Division's regulatory authority and is consistent with the corresponding limitation in the Federal regulations.    In addition, although the specific responsibilities of a State regulatory authority in administering the coal exploration program within a State are not addressed in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 772 for coal exploration, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 731.14(c)(1) requires each State to have enacted and promulgated laws and regulations which will allow the State to implement, administer, and enforce its program, and to regulate coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with SMCRA. Utah's proposed regulations at Utah Admin. R. 645200220 and 645200230, specifying the regulatory responsibilities of the Division, are thus consistent with the requirements of 30 CFR 731.14(c)(1).    Therefore, based on the foregoing discussion, the Director finds that Utah Admin. R. 645200220, 645200230, and 645201100 through 645201130 are not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 772. The Director approves these proposed rules.        IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments        Following are summaries of all substantive written comments on the proposed amendment that were received by OSM, and OSM's response to them.        1. Public Comments        OSM invited public comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT891), but none were received.        2. Federal Agency Comments        Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program.    In separate telephone conversations on February 11, June 1, and July 29, 1994, the Bureau of Mines stated it had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record Nos. UT893, UT933, and UT965).    The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service responded by letter dated March 7, 1994, that it found nothing of significant concern to the agency and again, by letters dated June 8 and August 9, 1994, that it had reviewed the proposed changes and had no comment on them (administrative record Nos.

None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its amendment pertained to air or water quality standards. Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment. However, pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (administrative record No. UT891). EPA responded by letters dated February 15 and June 8, 1994 (administrative record Nos. UT894 and UT936), that it had no comments on the proposed amendment and that it did not believe there would be any impacts to water quality standards promulgated under authority of the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251     et seq.    ).        4. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP)        Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from the SHPO and ACHP (administrative record No. UT891). By letter dated August 4, 1994, the SHPO indicated, after review of Utah Admin.

R. 645201110 and 645201120 to provide that only coal exploration operations on lands which are not subject to 43 CFR parts 34803487 will be regulated by the Division is thus an appropriate limitation on the Division's regulatory authority and is consistent with the corresponding limitation in the Federal regulations.    In addition, although the specific responsibilities of a State regulatory authority in administering the coal exploration program within a State are not addressed in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 772 for coal exploration, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 731.14(c)(1) requires each State to have enacted and promulgated laws and regulations which will allow the State to implement, administer, and enforce its program, and to regulate coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with SMCRA. Utah's proposed regulations at Utah Admin. R. 645200220 and 645200230, specifying the regulatory responsibilities of the Division, are thus consistent with the requirements of 30 CFR 731.14(c)(1).    Therefore, based on the foregoing discussion, the Director finds that Utah Admin. R. 645200220, 645200230, and 645201100 through 645201130 are not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 772. The Director approves these proposed rules.        IV.

BP Exploration yesterday declined to comment on its plans for Tex/Con. But sources in the energy industry said the sale would be in keeping with BP's shift of emphasis in its exploration activities from the lower 48 US states to 'frontier' areas, such as Alaska and central and south America. An analyst in London said Tex/Con is likely to fetch between Dollars 650 and Dollars 1bn. According to US reports, BP has appointed investment bank JP Morgan to handle the sale, and prospective buyers will soon be invited to inspect details of Tex/Con's financial and operating condition in New York and Houston. Tex/Con's business, which includes exploration, production and pipelines, is centred in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It has interests in 3,000 wells and operates 1,500 miles of gas-gathering pipelines. Tex/Con produces about 11,800 barrels of oil and 121m cu ft of gas a day. BP does not disclose revenue or profit figures for Tex/Con. But low natural gas prices, an inability to fully replace reserves and falling oil production appear to have contributed to BP's disillusion with Tex/Con, which was set up as an autonomous, entrepreneurial venture. Staff numbers have been sharply cut back in recent months as part of an effort to reduce overhead. The company's problems came into public view last week when BP announced that Tex/Con's chief executive Mr Bill Johnson was taking early retirement. Mr Johnson has been replaced by Mr Bill Sears, formerly vice-president for offshore exploration. While cutting back its exploration presence in the US, BP has been expanding in other parts of the western hemisphere. It recently opened an office in Caracas, Venezuela, and has become increasingly active in Colombia.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "
0,FT933-1251 ,"FT933-1251 _AN-DIXCIAF4FT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yemeni oil industry enters a new era - A development that has increased the country's output by two thirds      By ERIC WATKINS   CANADIAN Occidental Petroleum yesterday boosted Yemen's oil production by 60 per cent with the opening of its new fields in Masila. Brought on stream after an accelerated programme of development, Canadian Oxy's 120,000 barrels a day will increase Yemen's total output to just over 300,000 b/d. But more importantly, the new fields may open the way to further discoveries in coming months. Yemen's oil was first discovered in 1984 by the Dallas-based Hunt Oil Company, with further finds in 1986 by the former Soviet company, Technoexport. Taken together, the two sets of finds suggested the presence of a north-south oil trend and prompted Canadian Occidental to bid for a concession of its own in 1987. Concentrating its exploration efforts in the north-west corner of its 37,200 sq km concession area, Canadian Oxy began drilling in September 1990 and struck oil with its first well in January 1991. By December 1991, the company had drilled 14 wells and declared commerciality with an estimated 235m barrels of recoverable oil. Since then it company has drilled another 37 wells and increased its estimate of recoverable reserves to 460m barrels. Following its declaration of commerciality, the company began an accelerated construction programme to develop its production and export facility. In addition to the 51 wells and 55km of oil-gathering pipelines, Canadian Oxy has now constructed a central processing facility to purify and blend the oil, a 138km pipeline to the Gulf of Aden and an export terminal at Ash-Shihr with a loading rate of 60,000 barrels an hour. According to the production sharing agreement, the Yemen government will take 70 per cent of the liftings and Canadian Oxy 30 per cent. That shareout will sharply increase the country's export earnings. Prior to the new production levels, the government was understood to receive about 90,000 b/d from the Hunt field, of which 65,000 were used for domestic consumption. Added to the remaining 25,000 b/d per day, the new production figures from the Canadian Oxy field should give the government roughly 109,000 b/d day for export. The increased production will be a boon to Yemen's sagging economy and political structure. Since the Gulf War unemployment has stood at 36 per cent and annual inflation at 100 per cent. In October 1991 and again in December 1992, there were protest riots which left over 100 dead and many more injured. To maintain optimism, the government has long played up news of the country's oil potential and Canadian Oxy production will provide some justification for the its claims. Apart from the immediate rise in production figures, however, the Canadian Oxy discoveries have created a sense of optimism about further oil potential in the country. So far the company has fully explored only about 20 per cent of its own concession area and has now stepped up the pace of exploration to the east and south of Wadi Masila. Mr Ray Irani, chairman of the boards of US and Canadian Occidental, has expressed optimism that more oil will be found in the concession area and in the country as a whole. 'With oil production now at 300,000 b/d and increasing in the future, the prospects for Yemen's hydrocarbons industry are bright,' Mr Irani said. That view is shared by other companies operating in the region, particularly Total, Clyde Petroleum, and Lasmo Oil (Aden), which hold concession areas adjacent to Canadian Oxy's. Indeed, Total's recent discovery of 12,000 b/d in block 10, just east of Wadi Masila, now suggests that there may be another trend running to the north-east through the Canadian Oxy concession into those of Clyde and Lasmo. Mr Rod Makin, Lasmo's general manager, confirms the possibility of such a trend and is cautiously optimistic about his company's prospects regarding it. 'We are very hopeful about our chances in the Hood block, which is on one of the oil pathways of Yemen. We think we are on a trend and it just depends how far the trend extends,' he says. Lasmo began drilling its first well on September 1 and preliminary results could be available within a few weeks. Mr Makin underlines the significance of the results with care. 'This well and our next could be the turning point by proving the extension of the trend into the north-east,' he says. Mr Peter Bradley, general manager of Clyde, could not agree more. 'Yes', he says, 'the big question now is how far the trend extends. In that regard the Lasmo wells are important and could be most encouraging for us. They would automatically tell us that similar structures are in our fields. We have our fingers crossed.' According to Mr Bradley, Clyde will begin its exploratory drilling on November 1 this year. 'Clyde is reasonably optimistic, but we don't want to overplay it,' he says. 'This still is the exploration business and the next six to nine months will be a very intersting time for us.' Exploring for oil in Yemen is indeed risky. Most production sharing agreements now call for the collection of seismic data from at least 1,000km of survey lines and the drilling of three exploratory wells, all within 30 months. Elsewhere, according to Mr Bradley, the time frame for exploration is normally three or four times as long. Thus, in Yemen, companies are under considerable pressure to produce quickly. That pressure is increased by the size of concession areas and the nature of their terrain. With concession areas ranging from 1,200 sq km to 37,200 sq km, the odds are very clearly against exploration teams finding anything at all. As Mr Bradley put it, 'no company can possibly cover its entire concession area'. Thus, companies have to select carefully even before undertaking their seismic surveys. Because of the difficulties of the terrain, such surveys themselves can be costly and the results hard to interpret. Clyde, Lasmo, and Canadian Occidental are all operating on a plateau deeply incised by meandering Wadis. That means seismic data must frequently be collected by specialised vehicles - often helicopters - which can send costs as high as USDollars 13,000 a kilometre. The variable nature of the terrain, moreover, can affect the direction of seismic vibrations and produce misleading data. And, with drilling rigs estimated to cost between USDollars 2m and USDollars 6m each, such mistakes can be very costly. The odds against discovering oil in Yemen are therefore high and, not surprisingly, the list of dry wells is growing. But the achievement of Canadian Oxy is undeniable and has turned the eyes of oil men in new directions. 'One thing is for sure', says Mr Bradley.

Many oil companies have said the tax changes announced in the Budget will lead to a halving of exploration activity in the North Sea. The row in the industry over the tax changes was further fuelled yesterday by Wood MacKenzie, the Edinburgh-based oil analysts, who questioned the Treasury's forecasts for revenue from the tax measures. The analysts estimate that the changes will raise Pounds 115m in tax over the next three years rather than the Pounds 700m Treasury forecast. The Treasury has defended its tax measures by saying that the previous regime subsidised inefficient exploration. The new rules reduce the tax rate on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. They also abolish tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. BP said yesterday that the Forth field, which contains about 180m barrels of oil, will be more profitable as a result of the abolition of petroleum revenue tax on new oilfields. Industry analysts say the Forth field could be worth an additional Pounds 100m because of the proposed changes. Wood MacKenzie believes that six companies, including BP, stand to gain from the new proposals; six companies, including British Gas, will lose in the short term, but gain in the long term; and 17 companies will be overall losers. The analysts say the number of wells drilled in the North Sea could drop below 100 from 116 last year. BP plans to bring its Forth field on stream in early 1996. The company said yesterday that, although the field will be more profitable under the new tax rules, they will force more efficiency in development because there will be no chance of writing off cost overruns against tax.

0,FT932-435 ,"FT932-435 _AN-DF2CGACRFT 930629   FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Oil companies look west to a wild frontier - A guarded optimism revealed by the latest batch of exploration licences      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   WHEN MR Tim Eggar, energy minister, awarded the latest batch of oil exploration licences recently, he confirmed the trend for many companies to look for oil in some of the less traditional areas around UK waters. As the North Sea and the southern gas basin to the east of the country approach maturity - which means they have been so heavily explored, companies do not expect to make important discoveries there - the oil industry is focusing more of its exploration work in waters to the west and the south. This has seen companies planning to explore west of Shetland, closer to shore in the Irish channel, in Cardigan Bay and even in the south-western approaches. Mr Eggar is enthusiastic about this trend. 'I think we are on the verge of proving up a major new oil province which is significant for the future of the industry and UK oil production,' he said last week. The government has particularly strong hopes for the west-of-Shetland area, since several discoveries have been made there. 'It is yet more evidence that the UK continental shelf continues to yield great benefits for the economy,' Mr Eggar said. But Mr Eggar is probably more enthusiastic than some in the oil industry, who point to the enormous difficulties to be overcome before discoveries in these 'frontier' waters can be turned into commercial production. Mr Richard Hardman, exploration director at Amerada Hess which has made a discovery of around 200m barrels of oil west of Shetland, says he is optimistic but cautious. 'It's good to know there are big structures there and large potential reserves, but there is a huge challenge to find the technology and get it out at a reasonable cost.' If companies can find sizeable amounts of oil to exploit, these new provinces could prove extremely lucrative. The proposed changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes abolish tax on new fields, whereas the rate for existing fields is 50 per cent. This gives an added incentive to explore frontier waters. Many of these 'new' areas have been explored before - the Clair field which is estimated to contain 3bn barrels of oil was discovered in the region west of Shetland 20 years ago. The field has never been exploited because of complex geological problems associated with it and the lack of technology for extracting the oil. Improvements in technology for appraising and exploiting oil discoveries could make some of these more marginal areas viable for the first time. Nevertheless, it could be well into the next century before oil starts flowing from the west of Shetland region, although the waters of Cardigan Bay and the Irish channel could yield oil sooner. However, companies hoping to find oil in Cardigan Bay must work within strict environmental conditions. The area is one of great natural beauty and has a resident population of bottlenose dolphins. Environmentalists are threatening to challenge at an EC level the government's award of licences in sensitive areas such as Cardigan Bay. They say the licences could infringe EC environmental directives. The drawbacks in the west-of-Shetland waters are more prosaic. The operating conditions are among the harshest in the world because of the depth of the water and the bad weather. The water west of Shetland can be up to 6,000 ft deep, whereas the deepest producing platform in the North Sea is in water 600 ft deep. The weather is bad and companies are unable to gather seismic data needed for evaluating oil discoveries in winter as they can in the North Sea. In addition, the lack of infrastructure adds to the cost of development and production. British Petroleum made an important discovery of between 250m and 500m barrels of oil west of Shetland in March, which could cost Pounds 2bn to develop. 'You might be able to use a floating production system to extract the oil and then collect it in tankers,' said Ms Caroline Noble, industry analyst at Wood MacKenzie in Edinburgh. 'But the weather is so bad, you probably wouldn't be able to use it all year round.' BP is conducting its largest-ever offshore seismic programme in waters west of Shetland at a cost of Pounds 9.4m in order to gather more data on its discovery and hopes to drill another well before the end of the year. Mr Hardman points out that Amerada drilled 15 wells in this area before it made a discovery. It lies in only 410 ft of water and should be easier to exploit, but Mr Hardman is still cautious. He was encouraged by the fast flow of oil from one well at a rate of 8,000 barrels a day. But Amerada plans to drill a couple more wells before it decides whether the discovery can be exploited commercially - that decision will be taken in 1995. A group of companies is looking again at the Clair discovery in the hope of establishing a development programme for that towards the end of the decade. But the complexity of the field means that only 150m barrels from the 3bn in place could be extracted. In spite of the enormous challenges to be overcome in these areas, the industry remains keen to search for oil which could be flowing well into the 21st century.

The loss reflected a change in accounting policy and the subsequent write-off of Pounds 42.3m of costs of unsuccessful exploration. The year earlier net loss was a restated Pounds 1.2m after a Pounds 32.7m write-off. Turnover dropped to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 87.2m) Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the rights issue would give the company a cash cushion following the go-ahead of its development of the Gryphon field in the North Sea later this year. 'This is a major sea-change within Clyde - we're moving to the fast track development of Gryphon,' he said. Originally, Gryphon was due to come on stream in 1996 but Clyde now plans to start production in the final quarter of this year. That would involve investment of Pounds 90m - Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in Gryphon - this year which would push the company's debt to equity ratio to over 100 per cent. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said: 'We're at a peak of our expenditure this year and the rights issue will help keep that under control'. The rights issue, of 79.86m shares on a 1-for-4 basis, will give Clyde the flexibility to continue its exploration programme overseas while it proceeds with UK developments. Cashflow will increase to Pounds 350m next year as the company's production rises to 55,000 barrels a day in the second quarter from a current level of 23,874 b/d. With the strong cashflow, the company plans to pay down its debt quickly and reduce gearing from the 100 per cent level to 60 per cent by 1994 and 15 per cent by the end of 1996. The company is looking at break-even this year with possibly a small profit or loss.

Concession contracts to operate and explore marginal fields will be offered in late September or early October. Marginal fields are defined as those that now produce less than 1 per cent of Ecuador's total output. Petroecuador, the state-owned oil company, believes that reserves and production in these fields can be increased significantly with only modest investment. Under the current administration's oil policy Petroecuador's limited investment funds are to be utilised to develop the country's principal fields. A team of specialists is evaluating each of the 10 wells to be offered for bidding. The studies will determine precise investment requirements, which for now are estimated to total USDollars 60m. 'This is a low-risk investment,' says Mr Bernardo Perez of Petroecuador's contracting office, 'because the fields are already producing and much of the infrastructure is in place.' The oil fields combined proven reserves total more than 100m barrels but are expected to increase following exploration efforts. The operating cost per barrel of crude oil varies between Dollars 1.45 and Dollars 6. Under the newly devised contract the current output of each field will continue to go to Petroecuador and the contractors income will be generated by increasing production. The winning bidder will be the company that offers the state the highest percentage of the additional output and the largest investment. If the contractor proves unable to increase production within two years, the concession will be terminated and the field will have to be returned to state control. Part of the contract, which is to last for 20 years, will also allow for oil exploration in the immediate vicinity of the existing well sites. Newly discovered reserves will be remunerated over a fixed compensation period. Infrastructure or machinery installed by the contractor will become state property after the contract expires. The announcement of this latest bid comes only months after 10 petroleum companies won the right to explore and produce oil in over 2m hectares of Amazon rain forests.

0,FT923-2403 ,"FT923-2403 _AN-CIRBKAHNFT 920918   FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (11): Power for the people - The widening quest for energy sources      By FARHAN BOKHARI   POWER CUTS periodically show that Pakistan cannot meet the energy needs of a rapidly growing consumer market and industry. While the government has given fresh incentives to set up factories, providing investment in transportation and energy is also needed. In energy, Pakistan is seeking private sector investments in new electricity projects and oil and gas production. Industrial entrepreneurs are allowed to set up their own generation plants but that adds to the cost of new projects. Electricity generating capacity is projected to rise to 9,356 megawatts by the middle of next year, but demand is expected to rise to 11,000 MW by 1995. The supply is currently estimated to fall 10 to 15 per cent below demand depending on the output of hydro electric schemes which rely on rainfall. The government has let the private sector set up independent power plants to help meet the shortfall. Fresh measures have also been announced to increase production of petroleum, as the country produces 65,000 barrels of oil per day but needs to import about 170,000 b/d. Last year fresh incentives were introduced to stimulate exploration and refining. The government has promised to process applications for exploration licences within three months of submission. In the past, approvals have taken up to three years. Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, hopes there will be a surge in private power projects given the size of the country's population. 'In this expanding market, efficient generation of power is required. With privatisation, we expect to get the investment. Very few markets are that large and offer opportunities for investment', he says. Pakistan also sees opportunities for importing power, oil and gas from the newly independent central Asian republics and Afghanistan. An agreement has been signed with Tajikistan for the supply of 1,000 MW for which new transmission lines will be built. Imports of gas from Afghanistan and Turkmenistan will also be studied, and recent oil discoveries in Uzbekistan raise the possibility of importing oil from that country. All these proposals are fraught with difficulties, however. Energy investments will be repaid only in the long term. Although the population is rising, prosperity will also have to rise to ensure a bigger energy consumption. In spite of the inducements for oil and gas exploration, some businessmen believe that crime and violence, especially in remote areas of the southern province of Sindh, are a barrier to new exploration projects. The government has said it will set up a special force to protect oil installations, but it remains to be seen if that will reassure potential investors. Prospects for importing energy from central Asia depend on future events in Afghanistan. Pakistani officials who support the country's central Asian initiatives argue that the intra-mujahideen infighting in Kabul is likely to die down in the next two or three years, the time frame needed to begin establishing some of the projects. But no-one knows how long it will take before peace and stability are restored to Afghanistan. A durable peace there may be the key to Pakistan's central Asian strategy and its ability to draw on that region to meet its energy needs.  The Financial Times   London Page VI  "
0," LA062589-0006   74302    June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition      Magazine; Page 20; Magazine Desk      4074 words      SELLING MARS      By KATHRYN PHILLIPS, Kathryn Phillips' last story for this magazine was Closing  In on Cancer.      LOUIS Friedman, one-time rocket scientist and now, as head of the  Pasadena-based Planetary Society, one of the nation's most vocal cheerleaders  for planetary exploration, had waited a long time for this moment and wanted to  savor it in solitude. Launches always made him nervous, but this one, on a  morning last April, was special. If it worked, it would mark the end of more  than a decade of waiting for the United States to return to planetary  exploration. If it didn't, it would be just another on a list of  disappointments NASA has handed to Friedman in the past 17 years.    He moved a few feet from his friends among the crowd of spectators at Cape  Canaveral and positioned himself in clear view of the launch pad. Then he  stared into the distance at the space shuttle Atlantis, which was scheduled  momentarily to take the spacecraft Magellan into Earth orbit and then send it  on its way to Venus.    As a 31-year-old engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1972, Friedman's  first supervisory job was study leader and program manager for the then-unnamed  Magellan project. Had anyone told him then that he would be a grandfather by  the time Magellan flew, he wouldn't have believed them. But since the  mid-1970s, he had gradually become disillusioned with the false starts and  delays in the American space program.    This day, he had flown from California to Florida to watch the launch and take  part in a panel discussion, a sort of celebration of America's return to space  exploration. Standing alone at the edge of the crowd as the countdown entered  its last minute, he half expected another delay. An optimist about most things,  he had never had much faith in the wisdom of using the space shuttle instead of  conventional rockets to launch spacecraft.    At T-minus 30 seconds, the countdown stopped. A malfunction had been detected;  the shuttle engines shut down. Friedman was disappointed, and he couldn't help  but immediately see the irony.    ""When that thing didn't go, and I was looking out from the causeway, I could  also see a Titan (rocket) the Air Force was getting ready for another launch,""  he recalls a few weeks later. ""Boy, did I wish we were using that.""    A week later, the shuttle carrying Magellan successfully took off. By then,  Friedman was back in his office watching the event on television with his staff  at the Planetary Society. He is enough of a space groupie, he says, to enjoy  any successful launch -- even one that comes years late.    IN THE PLANETARY SOCIETY'S 16-room headquarters, in a turn-of-the-century  Greene and Greene mansion, Louis Friedman has the smallest office. (""Size is  not power,"" he says.) He sits at an old oak desk above which hangs a  needlepoint of Saturn stitched by his mother. When he's not on the phone, he's  likely to be bounding downstairs to consult with his secretaries or Tim Lynch,  the society's director of programs and development. He jogs each morning to  work off the calories of an occasional beer, but seeing him scurry around, one  wonders if the jogging isn't overkill.    For nearly a decade, Friedman has spent most of his waking hours as the pivotal  man in an exercise in mass salesmanship: finding ways to persuade Americans --  the public, politicians, bureaucrats and space scientists -- to rally behind  planetary exploration as they did in the 1960s, after the Soviets launched  Sputnik. In the past 25 years, he has evolved from space engineer to salesman  of dreams in an era of diminished dreaming. ""What I want to do,"" Friedman says,  ""is make space exploration happen.""    Under Friedman's direction, the Planetary Society is to planetary exploration  what Common Cause is to political campaigning or the Sierra Club is to  conservation. But in addition to calling for a general reform of the nation's  space program, it has channeled most of its energies into promoting a single  great notion: that of a joint U.S.-Soviet manned mission to Mars. The group's  leaders believe that the Mars mission -- with its underpinnings of global peace  through technology -- is the only aspiration grand enough to drum up the public  interest needed to fuel real-life star trekking. And, Friedman hopes, that  grass-roots enthusiasm will eventually bubble up to influence the Washington  policy-makers and budget writers who can put the civil space program back on  its old, optimistic track.    As executive director, Friedman is administrator, policy-maker, publicist and  even carnival barker, trying to lure passers-by inside the tent to see the  exotica -- in this case, the planets in Earth's solar system. Despite his  background as a card-carrying scientist, this may be the job he was born to do.  ""I live, breathe and eat Mars,"" he says.    Early one morning, he is in Lynch's office discussing the logistics of  scheduling Carl Sagan to testify before the House of Representatives on the  NASA budget. Moments later, he is in his own office meeting with Angela Brown,  a former Planetary Society staffer turned consultant, reviewing details for a  society-sponsored festival to coincide with Voyager II's encounter with Neptune  in August. By way of JPL, Voyager's live images of Neptune will be transmitted  to the festival.    Friedman squeezes his eyes shut to contain his enthusiasm when Brown tells him  a national auto maker is interested in sending Neptune images from the JPL feed  to all its dealerships through its internal cable system. ""Oh, I would love a  downlink (in the dealerships),"" he groans. ""Anything we can do to get this  stuff into peoples' hands across America.""    Later still, he returns calls from the Washington Post and an aerospace trade  magazine. One reporter wants a quick response from Friedman about news that the  Soviets have activated a camera on a spacecraft sent to the Martian moon  Phobos. Friedman raves over this development; the next day, he is the only  American quoted in the story.    His workday often starts early, with phone calls from home to the East Coast or  the Soviet Union, and doesn't end until evening. One night, Friedman, red-eyed  and weary, is the host at a Planetary Society reception. He has just heard a  colleague in the society suggest to a visitor that America's next space goal  should be to send more astronauts to the moon to set up a base. To Friedman,  the suggestion is close to heresy. It makes no sense to send more humans to the  moon because the whole idea bores the public, Friedman says, his voice rising.  Manned lunar missions would only drain America's civil-space budget away from a  more important, profound, exciting goal -- namely, Mars.    Friedman is forceful but good-humored as he argues. He is slightly rumpled, and  his mop of graying black hair hints of Harpo Marx. If he was selling something  simpler, like the women's hats his father once helped produce in New York, his  charm and persistence would probably have made Friedman a rich man. This  evening, though, his colleague can't be swayed. Friedman, undeterred and  indefatigable, wanders over to another knot of guests, prepared to make his  argument for a mission to Mars all over again.    WHO WOULD HAVE predicted in the 1960s that a role like Friedman's would exist,  much less be considered by so many to be necessary? Then, the promotion of  planetary exploration, fueled by Soviet space advances and Cold War  competitiveness, was led by an American President. John F. Kennedy talked about  the dreams and set the goals, rallying Americans to create grand technologies,  explore the universe, land on the moon -- and do it all before the Soviets  could. It was called the Space Race, with all the urgency that implies.    Through the 1970s, NASA launched 69 manned and unmanned missions. It was during  those boom times, in 1970, that Friedman joined JPL, after working on the  technical staff of a Massachusetts aerospace firm and then earning a doctorate  in astronautics and aeronautics at MIT. He immediately went to work on Mariner  10, which was launched just three years later and eventually flew by Venus and  Mercury, taking pictures that gave the earthbound the first detailed knowledge  of the innermost planets. When Friedman recalls the end of those heady days, he  sounds almost wistful. ""Then the shuttle came, and it just ruined everything.""    After Kennedy's death, White House-level passion for planetary exploration --  the key to funding -- began to dry up. Interest declined with each new  President and each new escalation of the dollar-draining Vietnam War. Then, in  1972, shortly after the last Apollo spacecraft landed a man on the moon,  President Nixon unveiled a plan to build a space shuttle, promoted as a  quicker, cheaper way to fly in space. (""You don't go to space to be cheap,""  Friedman grouses today. ""You stay home to be cheap."") Nixon rejected another of  the space program options recommended by a presidential commission -- sending  humans to Mars, an expensive project that would be completed many years after  his White House tenure.    Friedman considers Nixon's shuttle decision a turning point. NASA budgets began  to drop and planetary exploration, which a generation had come to believe would  be a continuing part of American achievement, suffered. In the mid-'60s, NASA's  annual budget climbed to $26 billion (in 1988 dollars). From 1972 through last  year, the agency's total budget averaged less than a third of that, about $8  billion a year (in 1988 dollars). Within that budget, planetary exploration  changed from favorite child to sad stepsister of the space shuttle. According  to one study of NASA budgets, when measured in dollars adjusted for inflation,  planetary funding dropped 75% between 1974 and 1978. The 1989 budget for  planetary exploration (about $417 million) remains lower than it was 15 years  ago, when the figures are adjusted for inflation.    After Pioneer Venus 10 blasted off toward Venus in 1978, exploration launches  stopped. Several unmanned planetary missions in development were relegated to  the back burner, including Magellan, the probe of Jupiter known as Galileo and  a joint European-U.S. mission to study the sun. Out of frustration, Friedman  applied for and won a yearlong fellowship to work on the staff of the Senate  committee that addresses space program goals and funding. It gave him a chance  to reassess his career while allowing him a bird's eye view of space  policy-making in Washington.    Meanwhile, back at JPL, two prominent space scientists also were alarmed at the  stagnation of NASA's planetary program. One was Bruce Murray, then director of  JPL; the other was star-astronomer Carl Sagan, a frequent visitor to the lab.  Both had been gratified to see public interest build as the two Voyager  spacecraft, launched in 1977, approached Jupiter. But they were distressed that  this public interest did not translate into money from Washington. President  Carter told Sagan as much at the White House.    Murray and Sagan, so accustomed to looking beyond the stars, readjusted their  gazes earthward. An organization to rally around planetary exploration would  have to start at the grass roots, they believed. But neither had the time to  start or run such a group. In spring, 1979, when Friedman visited JPL in  anticipation of returning in the fall, Murray asked him to direct the new  organization.    In late 1979, from his dining room table, Friedman launched the Planetary  Society. It had little money, three members and a vague idea about how to  attract more. The three co-founders had only their goals: to educate, to  influence space policy and, perhaps, to provide funding for planetary research.  And they decided they could do it all 3,000 miles from the hub of space  policy-making, in Pasadena, the home not only of JPL but of Friedman and  Murray, too.    By the end of its first year, the society had established the roots of a  sophisticated direct-mail operation and signed up more than 20,000 members.  Today, it has about 125,000 members in 104 countries and 26 part-time and  full-time employees. It is the largest (by about five times) and best-known  space-interest group in the world, and its annual budget exceeds $3.5 million,  supported mostly by membership fees of $20 to $30 and donations.    During its first years, the Planetary Society leaders hewed to a fairly  conservative line, advocating unmanned missions, testifying before committees  and spearheading studies to salvage planetary programs threatened by NASA  budget cuts. In 1981, Friedman organized society members in a letter-writing  campaign entreating NASA to reverse its decision to stay earthbound in 1986  while Halley's comet made one of its rare appearances. The campaign generated  10,000 letters but failed to get the government to plan a Halley's flyby.    Chastened by this defeat, the society took more aggressive action a year later  when the Senate refused to fund a NASA project that would have listened for  signs of intelligent life in outer space. The Planetary Society began financing  a similar project of its own. Film maker Steven Spielberg contributed $100,000  to help a Harvard scientist build and monitor a sophisticated radio system that  still operates today, waiting for a signal that earthlings are not alone.    But the society's leaders had not yet fixed upon the one grand goal that they  believed would get planetary research back on track. Inspiration arrived when,  in January, 1985, the society co-sponsored a symposium in Washington on the  effects of space weapons on civilian use of space.    The Reagan White House was gearing up its Star Wars program. Mikhail S.  Gorbachev had not yet come into power in the Soviet Union. Relations between  the two countries were tense. One afternoon, 600 people crowded into a room to  hear a panel that included Murray, Sagan and Roald Z. Sagdeev, then the leader  of the Soviet space program. In the course of the discussion, Sagdeev suggested  that the United States and the Soviet Union follow up on the cooperation  displayed in the docking of the Soyuz and Apollo spacecraft 10 years earlier.  What Sagan was to say next, Friedman recalls, sent a current of ""electricity""  through the audience.    ""If you are interested in pumping the economy,"" Sagan told the audience, ""there  are far better ways to do it (than the Strategic Defense Initiative). Think of  the major cooperative programs which are fully within our technological  capability and which could be done at a tiny fraction of the cost of Star Wars  technology. Think about a joint U.S.-Soviet-manned, and womanned, mission to  Mars.""    Sagan's words so ignited the Planetary Society board members that they later  adjourned with Sagdeev to a private room to discuss the idea. The Soviet  scientist talked excitedly about a split-mission idea, with each country  performing independent tasks that would add up to a complete manned mission to  Mars. Sagdeev's enthusiasm seemed to open new worlds of possibility. The  Planetary Society had found its goal.    IN 1985, AS THE Planetary Society was becoming euphoric about Mars, NASA was  entering one of its most depressing periods. The agency had spent an  ever-expanding amount of time and money developing a space shuttle that, 13  years after conception, seemed far from keeping its promise to boost space  commercialization by providing an oft-scheduled, reusable craft for launching  satellites and spacecraft.    Its proponents, led by now-retired NASA Administrator James Fletcher, had  promised that the shuttle could be built for billions of dollars less than its  critics claimed. By the mid-'80s, the critics were beginning to look right. The  shuttle was plagued by engineering problems, including faulty tiles and engine  failures, and was still unable to meet its flight schedule. So unreliable was  it that the Air Force and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  made plans to launch their satellites from conventional rockets.    To NASA, the Planetary Society was a sometimes useful civilian adjunct, an  effective promoter of planetary science, but little more. The society's dreams  of a return to the glory days of space exploration were just that to the agency  -- dreams easily dismissed, economically unrealistic, not on the agenda. Some  of the society's goals were shared by NASA, says NASA spokesman Charles  Redmond, but the two organizations disagreed on ""the timing of goals and  funding."" Friedman and the Planetary Society acknowledge that their efforts in  the mid-'80s had little policy effect on NASA. Relations between Fletcher and  the society were tense at best.    Then came the Challenger shuttle disaster of January, 1986, and massive  soul-searching at NASA. In 1987, as the agency looked for redirection, Fletcher  commissioned former astronaut Sally K. Ride to recommend how the agency could  regain its leadership in space. Ride sounded some of the Planetary Society's  goals when she called for NASA to expand exploration by returning to the moon  with one eventual mission of landing humans on Mars. She advised moving slowly:  ""America should not rush headlong toward Mars; we should adopt a strategy to  continue an orderly expansion outward from Earth.""    Ride's report, coupled with growing publicity for the Mars initiative, moved  Mars from the back burner to the national agenda. Friedman points out that  these days, when NASA talks about going to the moon, the goal is framed as a  precursor to an eventual Mars trip. He believes this would not have happened  without the constant prodding of the Planetary Society.    Any space project comes about as a budgetary interaction between NASA and  Congress, and on Capitol Hill, the society has had more success. For instance,  it claims some credit for blocking the Reagan Administration's plans to abandon  planetary exploration in 1981. It is generally credited with pushing through  legislation assuring that a conventional rocket will launch the Mars Observer,  an unmanned spacecraft designed to orbit and photograph the planet, when it  goes up in 1992. And now, occasionally, a resolution to support a joint  U.S.-Soviet Mars venture will be introduced and voted on -- so far to defeat --  in Congress.    For Friedman, small victories aren't enough. If all goes according to plan, the  Planetary Society will get to Mars before NASA does. In mid-February, the  society took its boldest step so far to stimulate public interest in the Mars  goal. It signed an agreement that, Friedman says, will make it the first  private group to participate with the Soviet Union in a space experiment.    That is why, on a recent afternoon, eight space engineers are seated around two  tables pushed together in the main room of the Pasadena headquarters. They make  up the team brought together by the society to develop one part of an  experimental balloon that is to be built by France's space agency. The balloon,  which will float just above the surface of Mars, will be released from an  unmanned Soviet spacecraft expected to be launched in 1994. For the Planetary  Society, this project is more than a simple engineering challenge. It is a  chance to prove that space cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United  States is possible. It is a symbolic way to move ahead with the Mars goal  without waiting for NASA and the White House to catch up.    The engineers at the table have volunteered or been hired by the society to  design a prototype of what is officially named the Surface Navigation Kontact  Experiment. The SNAKE, as it has been dubbed, will be a 30-foot-long titanium  guide rope that will dangle 100 feet from the balloon as it skims the surface  of Mars. The SNAKE will gather dirt and pebbles from the red planet for  analysis by the small instruments it will carry, which will also study the  balloon's speed and the Martian atmosphere.    The society has agreed to finance production of the SNAKE through its first  prototype; Friedman figures that the first two years of development will cost  $450,000, one-third to one-fifth of what it would cost if a government agency  was conducting the project. The society has already garnered $75,000 in  donations from one mailing to its members. A private foundation has donated  $30,000.    The meeting goes slowly. By the time it ends, after 8 p.m., the youngest  engineer, Jim Cantrell, a graduate student at Utah State University, has  volunteered to make the first prototype in his garage. He builds race cars on  weekends, he says, so he has the necessary tools. They agree to meet in August  in the Mojave Desert to test Cantrell's creation before they deliver it to  France in September.    A 1988 TIME MAGAZINE poll reported that 72% of Americans believe that a joint  U.S.-Soviet Mars mission is a good idea; newspapers editorialize in support of  it; the Planetary Society even got 250 celebrities, from former U.N. Ambassador  Jeane J. Kirkpatrick to Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, to sign its ""Mars  Declaration,"" an 800-word statement published last year calling for human  exploration of Mars. Even Redmond, at NASA, admits its appeal: Everyone at the  space agency, he says, thinks it would ""be a great thing to do."" Then come the  caveats. Is basing a mission on cooperation between the United States and the  Soviet Union ridiculously optimistic? ""Making Mars (exploration) dependent on  peace on earth undermines the chance of going to Mars,"" says John Logsdon, a  Planetary Society advisory board member who directs the Space Policy Institute  at George Washington University. And Redmond says that NASA is concerned that  it does not have the technological know-how to send people to Mars.    Most naysayers, though, talk money. By Friedman's estimate, the joint mission  would cost $60 billion. Redmond says $100 billion is a conservative estimate.  To get to Mars, he says, and complete other existing projects, NASA would have  to squeeze at least $20 billion a year from Congress over 10 years. Today, the  agency is barely able to get $12 billion annually. Considering competing budget  demands and the U.S. deficit, he says, the needed level of funding is unlikely.    Scientists have another question about the economics. ""There's sort of a  knee-jerk enthusiasm for a grand mission, and I join in that to some degree,""  says physicist James Van Allen, a member of the Planetary Society's advisory  board and discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belt that surrounds Earth.  However, he sees the Mars mission as a ""vastly expensive undertaking"" that  would ""seriously handicap"" valuable unmanned projects.    The criticisms cause Friedman to launch into his best salesman persona,  slightly irritated because the naysayers just don't understand. It's a  chicken-and-egg proposition, he says. Just as the moon goal of the 1960s helped  generate financing for other planetary projects, he says, so, too, would the  Mars goal enhance all planetary exploration. We set the moon as a goal, he  argues, before the technology existed to take men there. As for the wisdom of  linking an exploration goal to unstable earthly relations, Friedman is  pragmatic and optimistic there, too. A human mission to Mars, with its huge  price tag and risks, can only be justified if it serves a strong national  purpose, he says.    And when it comes to the price, the society has a strategy that actually  matches NASA's. Redmond says that the only way to obtain the funding is with  presidential backing. Friedman is asking that all 130,000 signers of the Mars  Declaration write to President Bush before July 20, the 20th anniversary of the  first moon landing, urging him to support the Mars goal. However, Friedman  concedes that if even this anniversary cannot inspire Bush to acknowledge the  Mars initiative, ""the whole momentum will be lost"" for at least the next four  years. But patience and persistence are part of Friedman's strategy, too. The  challenge for the Planetary Society in a changing world is to keep the verve in  the Mars initiative. And if Friedman fails? What if, in the end, he cannot sell  the Mars vision to the White House or Congress or NASA? Will it all have been a  waste?    Friedman is sitting over a lunch of beer and bratwurst at a Pasadena restaurant  as he considers this. He pauses for a moment and then begins talking about John  Gardner, the founder of Common Cause who, early on, provided Friedman with key  advice on how to set up a public-interest group. ""Reform is never completed.  You never succeed,"" Friedman says, paraphrasing Gardner. ""It's a process. It  goes on and on and on and on. We always look at our goal as long range. We  always keep hope alive.""      Photo, COLOR, Louis Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, . .  .

This day, he had flown from California to Florida to watch the launch and take  part in a panel discussion, a sort of celebration of America's return to space  exploration. Standing alone at the edge of the crowd as the countdown entered  its last minute, he half expected another delay. An optimist about most things,  he had never had much faith in the wisdom of using the space shuttle instead of  conventional rockets to launch spacecraft.    At T-minus 30 seconds, the countdown stopped. A malfunction had been detected;  the shuttle engines shut down. Friedman was disappointed, and he couldn't help  but immediately see the irony.    ""When that thing didn't go, and I was looking out from the causeway, I could  also see a Titan (rocket) the Air Force was getting ready for another launch,""  he recalls a few weeks later. ""Boy, did I wish we were using that.""    A week later, the shuttle carrying Magellan successfully took off. By then,  Friedman was back in his office watching the event on television with his staff  at the Planetary Society. He is enough of a space groupie, he says, to enjoy  any successful launch -- even one that comes years late.    IN THE PLANETARY SOCIETY'S 16-room headquarters, in a turn-of-the-century  Greene and Greene mansion, Louis Friedman has the smallest office. (""Size is  not power,"" he says.) He sits at an old oak desk above which hangs a  needlepoint of Saturn stitched by his mother. When he's not on the phone, he's  likely to be bounding downstairs to consult with his secretaries or Tim Lynch,  the society's director of programs and development. He jogs each morning to  work off the calories of an occasional beer, but seeing him scurry around, one  wonders if the jogging isn't overkill.    For nearly a decade, Friedman has spent most of his waking hours as the pivotal  man in an exercise in mass salesmanship: finding ways to persuade Americans --  the public, politicians, bureaucrats and space scientists -- to rally behind  planetary exploration as they did in the 1960s, after the Soviets launched  Sputnik. In the past 25 years, he has evolved from space engineer to salesman  of dreams in an era of diminished dreaming. ""What I want to do,"" Friedman says,  ""is make space exploration happen.""    Under Friedman's direction, the Planetary Society is to planetary exploration  what Common Cause is to political campaigning or the Sierra Club is to  conservation. But in addition to calling for a general reform of the nation's  space program, it has channeled most of its energies into promoting a single  great notion: that of a joint U.S.-Soviet manned mission to Mars. The group's  leaders believe that the Mars mission -- with its underpinnings of global peace  through technology -- is the only aspiration grand enough to drum up the public  interest needed to fuel real-life star trekking. And, Friedman hopes, that  grass-roots enthusiasm will eventually bubble up to influence the Washington  policy-makers and budget writers who can put the civil space program back on  its old, optimistic track.    As executive director, Friedman is administrator, policy-maker, publicist and  even carnival barker, trying to lure passers-by inside the tent to see the  exotica -- in this case, the planets in Earth's solar system. Despite his  background as a card-carrying scientist, this may be the job he was born to do.  ""I live, breathe and eat Mars,"" he says.    Early one morning, he is in Lynch's office discussing the logistics of  scheduling Carl Sagan to testify before the House of Representatives on the  NASA budget. Moments later, he is in his own office meeting with Angela Brown,  a former Planetary Society staffer turned consultant, reviewing details for a  society-sponsored festival to coincide with Voyager II's encounter with Neptune  in August. By way of JPL, Voyager's live images of Neptune will be transmitted  to the festival.    Friedman squeezes his eyes shut to contain his enthusiasm when Brown tells him  a national auto maker is interested in sending Neptune images from the JPL feed  to all its dealerships through its internal cable system. ""Oh, I would love a  downlink (in the dealerships),"" he groans. ""Anything we can do to get this  stuff into peoples' hands across America.""    Later still, he returns calls from the Washington Post and an aerospace trade  magazine. One reporter wants a quick response from Friedman about news that the  Soviets have activated a camera on a spacecraft sent to the Martian moon  Phobos. Friedman raves over this development; the next day, he is the only  American quoted in the story.    His workday often starts early, with phone calls from home to the East Coast or  the Soviet Union, and doesn't end until evening. One night, Friedman, red-eyed  and weary, is the host at a Planetary Society reception. He has just heard a  colleague in the society suggest to a visitor that America's next space goal  should be to send more astronauts to the moon to set up a base. To Friedman,  the suggestion is close to heresy. It makes no sense to send more humans to the  moon because the whole idea bores the public, Friedman says, his voice rising.  Manned lunar missions would only drain America's civil-space budget away from a  more important, profound, exciting goal -- namely, Mars.    Friedman is forceful but good-humored as he argues. He is slightly rumpled, and  his mop of graying black hair hints of Harpo Marx. If he was selling something  simpler, like the women's hats his father once helped produce in New York, his  charm and persistence would probably have made Friedman a rich man. This  evening, though, his colleague can't be swayed. Friedman, undeterred and  indefatigable, wanders over to another knot of guests, prepared to make his  argument for a mission to Mars all over again.    WHO WOULD HAVE predicted in the 1960s that a role like Friedman's would exist,  much less be considered by so many to be necessary? Then, the promotion of  planetary exploration, fueled by Soviet space advances and Cold War  competitiveness, was led by an American President. John F. Kennedy talked about  the dreams and set the goals, rallying Americans to create grand technologies,  explore the universe, land on the moon -- and do it all before the Soviets  could. It was called the Space Race, with all the urgency that implies.    Through the 1970s, NASA launched 69 manned and unmanned missions. It was during  those boom times, in 1970, that Friedman joined JPL, after working on the  technical staff of a Massachusetts aerospace firm and then earning a doctorate  in astronautics and aeronautics at MIT. He immediately went to work on Mariner  10, which was launched just three years later and eventually flew by Venus and  Mercury, taking pictures that gave the earthbound the first detailed knowledge  of the innermost planets. When Friedman recalls the end of those heady days, he  sounds almost wistful. ""Then the shuttle came, and it just ruined everything.""    After Kennedy's death, White House-level passion for planetary exploration --  the key to funding -- began to dry up. Interest declined with each new  President and each new escalation of the dollar-draining Vietnam War. Then, in  1972, shortly after the last Apollo spacecraft landed a man on the moon,  President Nixon unveiled a plan to build a space shuttle, promoted as a  quicker, cheaper way to fly in space. (""You don't go to space to be cheap,""  Friedman grouses today. ""You stay home to be cheap."") Nixon rejected another of  the space program options recommended by a presidential commission -- sending  humans to Mars, an expensive project that would be completed many years after  his White House tenure.    Friedman considers Nixon's shuttle decision a turning point. NASA budgets began  to drop and planetary exploration, which a generation had come to believe would  be a continuing part of American achievement, suffered. In the mid-'60s, NASA's  annual budget climbed to $26 billion (in 1988 dollars). From 1972 through last  year, the agency's total budget averaged less than a third of that, about $8  billion a year (in 1988 dollars). Within that budget, planetary exploration  changed from favorite child to sad stepsister of the space shuttle. According  to one study of NASA budgets, when measured in dollars adjusted for inflation,  planetary funding dropped 75% between 1974 and 1978. The 1989 budget for  planetary exploration (about $417 million) remains lower than it was 15 years  ago, when the figures are adjusted for inflation.    After Pioneer Venus 10 blasted off toward Venus in 1978, exploration launches  stopped. Several unmanned planetary missions in development were relegated to  the back burner, including Magellan, the probe of Jupiter known as Galileo and  a joint European-U.S. mission to study the sun. Out of frustration, Friedman  applied for and won a yearlong fellowship to work on the staff of the Senate  committee that addresses space program goals and funding. It gave him a chance  to reassess his career while allowing him a bird's eye view of space  policy-making in Washington.    Meanwhile, back at JPL, two prominent space scientists also were alarmed at the  stagnation of NASA's planetary program. One was Bruce Murray, then director of  JPL; the other was star-astronomer Carl Sagan, a frequent visitor to the lab.  Both had been gratified to see public interest build as the two Voyager  spacecraft, launched in 1977, approached Jupiter. But they were distressed that  this public interest did not translate into money from Washington. President  Carter told Sagan as much at the White House.    Murray and Sagan, so accustomed to looking beyond the stars, readjusted their  gazes earthward. An organization to rally around planetary exploration would  have to start at the grass roots, they believed. But neither had the time to  start or run such a group. In spring, 1979, when Friedman visited JPL in  anticipation of returning in the fall, Murray asked him to direct the new  organization.    In late 1979, from his dining room table, Friedman launched the Planetary  Society. It had little money, three members and a vague idea about how to  attract more. The three co-founders had only their goals: to educate, to  influence space policy and, perhaps, to provide funding for planetary research.  And they decided they could do it all 3,000 miles from the hub of space  policy-making, in Pasadena, the home not only of JPL but of Friedman and  Murray, too.    By the end of its first year, the society had established the roots of a  sophisticated direct-mail operation and signed up more than 20,000 members.  Today, it has about 125,000 members in 104 countries and 26 part-time and  full-time employees. It is the largest (by about five times) and best-known  space-interest group in the world, and its annual budget exceeds $3.5 million,  supported mostly by membership fees of $20 to $30 and donations.    During its first years, the Planetary Society leaders hewed to a fairly  conservative line, advocating unmanned missions, testifying before committees  and spearheading studies to salvage planetary programs threatened by NASA  budget cuts. In 1981, Friedman organized society members in a letter-writing  campaign entreating NASA to reverse its decision to stay earthbound in 1986  while Halley's comet made one of its rare appearances. The campaign generated  10,000 letters but failed to get the government to plan a Halley's flyby.    Chastened by this defeat, the society took more aggressive action a year later  when the Senate refused to fund a NASA project that would have listened for  signs of intelligent life in outer space. The Planetary Society began financing  a similar project of its own. Film maker Steven Spielberg contributed $100,000  to help a Harvard scientist build and monitor a sophisticated radio system that  still operates today, waiting for a signal that earthlings are not alone.    But the society's leaders had not yet fixed upon the one grand goal that they  believed would get planetary research back on track. Inspiration arrived when,  in January, 1985, the society co-sponsored a symposium in Washington on the  effects of space weapons on civilian use of space.    The Reagan White House was gearing up its Star Wars program. Mikhail S.  Gorbachev had not yet come into power in the Soviet Union. Relations between  the two countries were tense. One afternoon, 600 people crowded into a room to  hear a panel that included Murray, Sagan and Roald Z. Sagdeev, then the leader  of the Soviet space program. In the course of the discussion, Sagdeev suggested  that the United States and the Soviet Union follow up on the cooperation  displayed in the docking of the Soyuz and Apollo spacecraft 10 years earlier.  What Sagan was to say next, Friedman recalls, sent a current of ""electricity""  through the audience.    ""If you are interested in pumping the economy,"" Sagan told the audience, ""there  are far better ways to do it (than the Strategic Defense Initiative). Think of  the major cooperative programs which are fully within our technological  capability and which could be done at a tiny fraction of the cost of Star Wars  technology. Think about a joint U.S.-Soviet-manned, and womanned, mission to  Mars.""    Sagan's words so ignited the Planetary Society board members that they later  adjourned with Sagdeev to a private room to discuss the idea. The Soviet  scientist talked excitedly about a split-mission idea, with each country  performing independent tasks that would add up to a complete manned mission to  Mars. Sagdeev's enthusiasm seemed to open new worlds of possibility. The  Planetary Society had found its goal.    IN 1985, AS THE Planetary Society was becoming euphoric about Mars, NASA was  entering one of its most depressing periods. The agency had spent an  ever-expanding amount of time and money developing a space shuttle that, 13  years after conception, seemed far from keeping its promise to boost space  commercialization by providing an oft-scheduled, reusable craft for launching  satellites and spacecraft.    Its proponents, led by now-retired NASA Administrator James Fletcher, had  promised that the shuttle could be built for billions of dollars less than its  critics claimed. By the mid-'80s, the critics were beginning to look right. The  shuttle was plagued by engineering problems, including faulty tiles and engine  failures, and was still unable to meet its flight schedule. So unreliable was  it that the Air Force and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  made plans to launch their satellites from conventional rockets.    To NASA, the Planetary Society was a sometimes useful civilian adjunct, an  effective promoter of planetary science, but little more. The society's dreams  of a return to the glory days of space exploration were just that to the agency  -- dreams easily dismissed, economically unrealistic, not on the agenda. Some  of the society's goals were shared by NASA, says NASA spokesman Charles  Redmond, but the two organizations disagreed on ""the timing of goals and  funding."" Friedman and the Planetary Society acknowledge that their efforts in  the mid-'80s had little policy effect on NASA. Relations between Fletcher and  the society were tense at best.    Then came the Challenger shuttle disaster of January, 1986, and massive  soul-searching at NASA. In 1987, as the agency looked for redirection, Fletcher  commissioned former astronaut Sally K. Ride to recommend how the agency could  regain its leadership in space. Ride sounded some of the Planetary Society's  goals when she called for NASA to expand exploration by returning to the moon  with one eventual mission of landing humans on Mars. She advised moving slowly:  ""America should not rush headlong toward Mars; we should adopt a strategy to  continue an orderly expansion outward from Earth.""    Ride's report, coupled with growing publicity for the Mars initiative, moved  Mars from the back burner to the national agenda. Friedman points out that  these days, when NASA talks about going to the moon, the goal is framed as a  precursor to an eventual Mars trip. He believes this would not have happened  without the constant prodding of the Planetary Society.    Any space project comes about as a budgetary interaction between NASA and  Congress, and on Capitol Hill, the society has had more success. For instance,  it claims some credit for blocking the Reagan Administration's plans to abandon  planetary exploration in 1981. It is generally credited with pushing through  legislation assuring that a conventional rocket will launch the Mars Observer,  an unmanned spacecraft designed to orbit and photograph the planet, when it  goes up in 1992. And now, occasionally, a resolution to support a joint  U.S.-Soviet Mars venture will be introduced and voted on -- so far to defeat --  in Congress.    For Friedman, small victories aren't enough. If all goes according to plan, the  Planetary Society will get to Mars before NASA does. In mid-February, the  society took its boldest step so far to stimulate public interest in the Mars  goal. It signed an agreement that, Friedman says, will make it the first  private group to participate with the Soviet Union in a space experiment.    That is why, on a recent afternoon, eight space engineers are seated around two  tables pushed together in the main room of the Pasadena headquarters. They make  up the team brought together by the society to develop one part of an  experimental balloon that is to be built by France's space agency. The balloon,  which will float just above the surface of Mars, will be released from an  unmanned Soviet spacecraft expected to be launched in 1994. For the Planetary  Society, this project is more than a simple engineering challenge. It is a  chance to prove that space cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United  States is possible. It is a symbolic way to move ahead with the Mars goal  without waiting for NASA and the White House to catch up.    The engineers at the table have volunteered or been hired by the society to  design a prototype of what is officially named the Surface Navigation Kontact  Experiment. The SNAKE, as it has been dubbed, will be a 30-foot-long titanium  guide rope that will dangle 100 feet from the balloon as it skims the surface  of Mars. The SNAKE will gather dirt and pebbles from the red planet for  analysis by the small instruments it will carry, which will also study the  balloon's speed and the Martian atmosphere.    The society has agreed to finance production of the SNAKE through its first  prototype; Friedman figures that the first two years of development will cost  $450,000, one-third to one-fifth of what it would cost if a government agency  was conducting the project. The society has already garnered $75,000 in  donations from one mailing to its members. A private foundation has donated  $30,000.    The meeting goes slowly. By the time it ends, after 8 p.m., the youngest  engineer, Jim Cantrell, a graduate student at Utah State University, has  volunteered to make the first prototype in his garage. He builds race cars on  weekends, he says, so he has the necessary tools. They agree to meet in August  in the Mojave Desert to test Cantrell's creation before they deliver it to  France in September.    A 1988 TIME MAGAZINE poll reported that 72% of Americans believe that a joint  U.S.-Soviet Mars mission is a good idea; newspapers editorialize in support of  it; the Planetary Society even got 250 celebrities, from former U.N. Ambassador  Jeane J. Kirkpatrick to Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, to sign its ""Mars  Declaration,"" an 800-word statement published last year calling for human  exploration of Mars. Even Redmond, at NASA, admits its appeal: Everyone at the  space agency, he says, thinks it would ""be a great thing to do."" Then come the  caveats. Is basing a mission on cooperation between the United States and the  Soviet Union ridiculously optimistic? ""Making Mars (exploration) dependent on  peace on earth undermines the chance of going to Mars,"" says John Logsdon, a  Planetary Society advisory board member who directs the Space Policy Institute  at George Washington University. And Redmond says that NASA is concerned that  it does not have the technological know-how to send people to Mars.    Most naysayers, though, talk money. By Friedman's estimate, the joint mission  would cost $60 billion. Redmond says $100 billion is a conservative estimate.  To get to Mars, he says, and complete other existing projects, NASA would have  to squeeze at least $20 billion a year from Congress over 10 years. Today, the  agency is barely able to get $12 billion annually. Considering competing budget  demands and the U.S. deficit, he says, the needed level of funding is unlikely.    Scientists have another question about the economics. ""There's sort of a  knee-jerk enthusiasm for a grand mission, and I join in that to some degree,""  says physicist James Van Allen, a member of the Planetary Society's advisory  board and discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belt that surrounds Earth.  However, he sees the Mars mission as a ""vastly expensive undertaking"" that  would ""seriously handicap"" valuable unmanned projects.    The criticisms cause Friedman to launch into his best salesman persona,  slightly irritated because the naysayers just don't understand. It's a  chicken-and-egg proposition, he says. Just as the moon goal of the 1960s helped  generate financing for other planetary projects, he says, so, too, would the  Mars goal enhance all planetary exploration. We set the moon as a goal, he  argues, before the technology existed to take men there. As for the wisdom of  linking an exploration goal to unstable earthly relations, Friedman is  pragmatic and optimistic there, too. A human mission to Mars, with its huge  price tag and risks, can only be justified if it serves a strong national  purpose, he says.    And when it comes to the price, the society has a strategy that actually  matches NASA's. Redmond says that the only way to obtain the funding is with  presidential backing. Friedman is asking that all 130,000 signers of the Mars  Declaration write to President Bush before July 20, the 20th anniversary of the  first moon landing, urging him to support the Mars goal. However, Friedman  concedes that if even this anniversary cannot inspire Bush to acknowledge the  Mars initiative, ""the whole momentum will be lost"" for at least the next four  years. But patience and persistence are part of Friedman's strategy, too. The  challenge for the Planetary Society in a changing world is to keep the verve in  the Mars initiative. And if Friedman fails? What if, in the end, he cannot sell  the Mars vision to the White House or Congress or NASA? Will it all have been a  waste?    Friedman is sitting over a lunch of beer and bratwurst at a Pasadena restaurant  as he considers this. He pauses for a moment and then begins talking about John  Gardner, the founder of Common Cause who, early on, provided Friedman with key  advice on how to set up a public-interest group. ""Reform is never completed.  You never succeed,"" Friedman says, paraphrasing Gardner. ""It's a process. It  goes on and on and on and on. We always look at our goal as long range. We  always keep hope alive.""      Photo, COLOR, Louis Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, . .  .

Mr Savit Bhotiwihok, the minister responsible for energy policy, told a meeting of the Petroleum Institute of Thailand that the government would focus on developing domestic and regional energy supplies to meet electricity demand which is growing by an annual 10 to 15 per cent - or by roughly 1,000 megawatts a year. He said he expected to sign a memorandum of understanding next month with the government of Laos on the purchase of between 1,000 Mw and 1,500 Mw of electricity from proposed hydro-electric and coal-fired power stations in that country. By the end of this year, he added, Thailand and Malaysia could have completed negotiations on the sale of Malaysian gas to feed a power station with a capacity of about 1,800 Mw on or near their common border. A pipeline to the frontier area is already under construction on the Malaysian side. He said other possible sources of energy for Thailand included the offshore exploration zone shared by Malaysia and Thailand, the hydro-electric potential of the Mekong river, Burmese gas, and hydrocarbons from Cambodia and Vietnam. Mr Savit acknowledged that Thailand would continue to import oil from the Middle East but he raised the possibility of a European-style regional gas network and said: 'A lot of our effort nowadays is spent on studying the integration with our neighbouring countries'. The Thai government would vigorously support exploration and development of oil and gas fields in Thailand, and study the possibility of establishing a nuclear power industry. Development of lignite resources would also probably continue, but the government was unlikely to proceed with building new dams solely for the purpose of generating electricity. Mr Savit said that the Petroleum Authority of Thailand would be assigned to explore the possibility of building export refineries and establishing a 'huge' oil storage capacity in southern Thailand to 'stabilise' the regional oil market.

0,FT941-12959 ,"FT941-12959 _AN-EA0DIAGYFT 940127   FT  27 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greece to offer onshore and offshore concessions      By KERIN HOPE      ATHENS   Greece's Public Petroleum Corporation (DEP) plans to offer concessions for onshore and offshore oil exploration in western Greece later this year. Blocks in Epirus and the Ionian Sea would be made available to international bidders after parliament passed a new law on oil exploration and exploitation, 'probably in late spring', according to Mrs Teresa Fokianou-Malaveta, the corporation's chairman. DEP's research department said seismic studies in Epirus produced encouraging results, while test drilling in the Ionian Sea had established the existence of oil-bearing levels, she added. Under production-sharing arrangements included in the new legislation DEP would have the right to participate with a minority stake in consortia exploiting oil deposits in Greece. Meanwhile, a new test drilling is being made by North Aegean Petroleum Corporation at the Prinos offshore field near Thassos island in the north-eastern Aegean. The drilling is the first by NAPC, a Canadian-led consortium, since Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war in 1987 over conflicting claims to offshore oil rights in the Aegean. The dispute has prevented NAPC from exploring for oil east of Thassos. Production at the Prinos field, situated west of Thassos in Greek coastal waters, has declined from 26,000 barrels a day in the early 1980s to about 8,000 b/d last year. However, the introduction of gas re-injection techniques, using natural gas from the nearby South Kavalla offshore field, has lifted production to around 12,000 b/d. If successful, the Dollars 5.3m drilling project, reaching 2,000 metres below sea level, could yield up to 6,000 b/d, Mrs Fokianou-Malaveta said. The Greek government last year signed a new six-year production agreement with NAPC, giving the consortium a more favourable tax arrangement than previously. The consortium had considered shutting down its operations because of the political obstacles to exploiting known oil and gas deposits east of Thassos. It has invested Dollars 700m in Greece since it won the Prinos concession 20 years ago. Denison Mines of Canada controls 58 per cent of the consortium. DEP holds 15 per cent, with subsidiaries of three other international oil companies, Wintershall Greece, Hellenic Overseas Holdings and White Shields Greece, holding smaller stakes.

Addressing the China petroleum investment conference which  opened here today, he said China ""offers much scope for oil  exploration and development"" and has ""bright prospects for  economic growth and the growth of the oil sector.""    Therefore, he said, China ""has a strong interest in helping  to maintain a reasonable level of oil prices, which will  encourage further investment.""    The China petroleum investment conference, attended by a  total of 329 delegates from 183 well-known multinational oil  companies, banks and financial organizations and China's oil  industry, is the highest-ranking international oil forum ever  held in the country.    The delegates were expected to discuss issues concerning  joint and cooperative exploration and development of China's oil  and natural gas resources during the two-day conference.    Addressing the opening, Wang Tao, president of the China  National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), spelt out China's  strategy to develop its oil industry.    He said China has opened its petroleum industry to the  outside world and thus provided more opportunities to foreign  investors.    He added that China welcomes world investors to cooperate in  China's petroleum industry.    Sheng Huaren, president of the China Petrochemical  Corporation (Sinopec), Wang Yan, president of the China National  Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and Zheng Dunxun, president of  the China Chemical Import and Export Corporation (Sinochem),  spoke on the development trends in China's oil and petrochemical  industries.    Also present at the meeting were Omani Deputy Minister of  Petroleum and Minerals Salem Shaban.    The conference, sponsored by the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, CNPC,  Sinopec, CNOOC and Sinochem, is designed to provide a forum for  oil companies and financial institutions both in and outside  China to increase understanding and exchange information.    Foreign delegates and speakers come from oil companies and  financial institutions including Esso, Chevron, Shell, Amoco,  Arco, BP, Texaco, ELF, the Japan National Oil Corp., Mitsubishi,  the Japan Import  Export Bank, the Bank of America, and the  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

Houston-based Bellwether Exploration has said that in December it approached the UK-quoted company with merger proposals on the basis of 3.75 Aberdeen shares for each of its own. Based on an exchange price of Dollars 1.5395 to the pound, and Bellwether's share price of 62 1/2 cents, the proposal values each Aberdeen share at 10 3/4 p. The shares last night closed  1/8 p higher at 8 5/8p. Mr Darby Sere, chief executive of Bellwether, said the announcement was made in light of the almost-50 per cent rise in Aberdeen shares since the approach had first been made. He stressed the synergies between the two groups, which both own and operate North American assets. If an eventual offer succeeds, then the enlarged company would lose the USM quotation. Bellwether, an oil and gas exploration and production company, is traded on Nasdaq in the US. It has a market capitalisation of about Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 7.5m) and is 80 per cent held by three UK institutions and Torchmark, the US insurance company. It is extremely unlikely, however, that Aberdeen would accept the initial proposals from Bellwether. Both companies have been in informal discussions for more than a year, said one observer close to Aberdeen. Yet the Bellwether proposal was believed to be somewhat different from the tentative arrangements discussed in the earlier informal meetings. The irony of yesterday's announcement was not lost on Aberdeen, which last month received short shrift from Brabant Resources, another USM-quoted company, to its own surprise merger proposals. Last week Brabant issued a strong statement stressing that Aberdeen's plan did not have the support of the board. Brabant said its North Sea assets and focus on exploration did not fit with Aberdeen's largely American base. Mr George Robb, the new chairman of Aberdeen, said his company was meeting with financial advisers to determine an appropriate response. The announcement would not alter the situation with Brabant, he added.   Companies:-  Aberdeen Petroleum.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT943-5294 ,"FT943-5294 _AN-EIECYACZFT 940905   FT  05 SEP 94 / Truly, deeply and profitably: Oil companies are successfully tapping previously inaccessible reservoirs      By ROBERT CORZINE   For much of this year US-registered exploration rigs have been flocking to the Gulf of Mexico to take part in what promises to be one of the most remarkable changes in the fortunes of an oil-producing area. After nearly 45 years of production, one of the world's most extensively drilled pieces of oil and gas-bearing seabed is attracting renewed interest from oil companies - in spite of relatively low world oil prices. The reason is that new technology has given oil companies the ability to explore large, geologically-complex areas, which were previously not thought to contain oil, or which defied conventional exploration methods. Industry observers say the new reserves in the Gulf of Mexico that can now be tapped could be large enough to slow the steady decline in overall US domestic production. The new techniques could also extend the productive life of other mature areas, including the UK and Norway's reserves in the North Sea. The resurgence of interest in the Gulf of Mexico results from two innovations. One is the growing technical ability to operate oil production platforms in deep water. The other is the extensive use of a new seismic technique which, combined with advances in computing power, is pinpointing oil and gas reserves where previously they could not be seen. The first of these innovations is the most visually dramatic. Until recently, most of the world's offshore oil platforms sat above a lattice work of steel, firmly fixed to the ocean floor. But the volume of steel needed to fix a deep-water platform to the seabed would make them uneconomic. To overcome this problem, oil companies working in the Gulf of Mexico are using the first of a new generation of floating structures known as 'tension leg platforms'. These are held in place by 12 steel pipes, each more than half a mile long, that run from the floating hull to the ocean floor. The design eliminates most unwanted vertical movement while allowing the structures to move with the waves. The first of these new structures came into operation in April when production commenced at Shell Oil's Auger platform in the Gulf of Mexico. It lies in 2,860 feet of water, a US record and one of the deepest oil platforms in the world. A new US depth record will be set in 1996 when Shell and its partner, British Petroleum, install a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 770m) platform in 2,933 feet of water over the Mars field, found in 1989 and the largest discovered in the gulf in 20 years. Lessons learnt in the Gulf of Mexico are being applied elsewhere. Shell and BP are partners in two UK deep-water projects west of the Shetland Islands that are currently being assessed for production. Mr Bob Howard, vice-president of domestic operations for Shell Oil, says the new drilling technology could help exploit an additional 8bn-15bn barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. In contrast to the small reservoirs common in the shallow water of the gulf, the new deep-water fields have much larger reserves. In the early 1980s, most geologists thought that these off-shore deep-water fields contained few oil-bearing sands, says Mr Howard. If these estimates are confirmed, it would place the Gulf of Mexico deep-water reservoirs in the same league as Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the biggest single oil field in the US, which accounts for a quarter of the country's daily output of 6.6m barrels. The change in exploration outlook was largely brought about by the second innovation that is opening up more of the world's oil reserves - the use of a three-dimensional seismic technique. This has allowed geologists to 'peek around corners', says Mr Howard. The new technique uses the same principle as conventional two-dimensional seismic surveys. Air guns towed by boats generate sound waves. The reflections from rocks under the seabed are picked up by lines of underwater sound receivers, known as hydrophones, towed by the boats. But three-dimensional surveys use many more air guns and hydrophone lines placed in parallel. That allows seismic 'snapshots' to be taken every 25 metres, compared with typically every 2km-3km in the past. The large amount of data generated would be useless, however, without rapid advances in computer processing. Mr David Work, group vice-president for exploration at US oil company Amoco in Houston, says increased computer power has cut the cost and the time it takes to interpret the data. 'It now costs Dollars 50,000 to process the same information that five years ago cost Dollars 250,000,' he says. BP officials say such technical advances have cut the time between the first seismic shot being fired and an exploration well being drilled to as little as six months. A couple of years ago the process would have taken two years. The Dollars 1bn or more that it takes to build a new generation deep-water platform has restricted interest to big oil companies. But smaller ones are among those leading the way in using three dimensional seismic surveys to explore beneath the seabed, where sheets of salt until recently formed a impenetrable blanket over as much as 60 per cent of the Gulf of Mexico. 'Five years ago if you hit salt you would stop drilling,' says Mr Clive Fowler, vice-president of Amoco's offshore business unit in New Orleans. The two-dimensional seismic technique then in use gave geologists insufficient detail to determine where the salt ended and any oil-bearing rocks began. But three-dimensional seismic combined with computer power have helped geologists to 'see' below the salt sheets, which can be about 5,000ft thick. The race to discover new fields in the Gulf of Mexico began last year when a consortium comprising Philips Petroleum, Amoco and Anadarko, a US independent explorer, announced a big commercial sub-salt discovery in the gulf. That set off competition to secure new government leases in areas covered by the salt. Experts are divided over whether the sub-salt reserves will rival those in deeper water. But 'if the sub-salt play is for real, it could be like rolling the clock back 30 years in the Gulf of Mexico', says Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, the New Orleans broker specialising in the energy industry. Unlike the deep-water finds, many of the most interesting sub-salt areas are in shallow water close to existing platforms and pipelines. That should keep development costs low. But even with the advantage of existing infrastructure and new seismic techniques, Mr Work does not expect the commercial success rate in developing sub-salt fields to lead to big improvements from the 10-12 per cent success rate in traditional areas. There are many technical problems, including the difficulty of drilling through the plastic-like salt without causing the well walls to collapse. Some industry observers predict that there will be 'many disappointments'. Earlier this summer, Philips and Anadarko announced the abandonment of a sub-salt exploration well due to problems with the well, even though it had hit large amounts of oil and gas. Some oil executives believe the full potential of the gulf will not be realised without government help. They say the high risk associated with deep-water development means that as much as half of the potential reserves might not be exploited unless the government provides royalty relief or a production tax credit. Both proposals are being considered in Washington. But Ms Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, says any relief would have to be 'revenue neutral', and not add to the federal budget deficit. The industry says any financial aid would pay for itself, with up to 100,000 jobs created by full-scale, deep-water development. But even if the full potential of the Gulf of Mexico is realised, it is unlikely to be enough to reverse the decline in US domestic production, caused mainly by the depletion of mature onshore fields. The government says large reservoirs of oil remain to be discovered in US coastal waters apart from the Gulf of Mexico. But most of these areas are covered by Congressionally-imposed environmental bans on drilling. The impact of the technical innovations on the reserve base and cost structure on the US oil industry will be substantial, however, even if their application is mainly confined to the Gulf of Mexico and other existing oil regions. In addition to pinpointing new reserves, three-dimensional seismic surveys of existing fields have uncovered nearby deposits missed in earlier studies. The technique has also given companies a better idea of how more oil and gas can be extracted from an existing reservoir, while the increase in information available to geologists has reduced the number of expensive, exploratory wells that need to be drilled in prospective fields.

Vinayak: ""Larger Role for Private Sector in  Mining""]    [Text] The Centre's new mineral policy envisages a larger  role for the private sector in areas hitherto reserved for the  public sector. Among the minerals dereserved are: copper,  zinc-lead ores, molybdenum, gypsum, tungsten and others, but  coal, lignite and atomic minerals are still retained in the list  for the public sector.    The new policy favours induction of foreign technology and  participation in mineral exploration and mining for high-value  and scarce minerals. Foreign equity investment in joint ventures  in mining, promoted by Indian companies, will be encouraged.  While foreign investment in equity will normally be limited to  50 per cent, this limitation will not apply to captive mines of  any mineral processing industry. Enhanced equity holding can  also be considered on a case-to-case basis, says the official  statement.    In respect of joint venture mining projects for minerals and  metals in which the country is deficient or does not have an  exportable surplus, a stipulated share of production will have  to be made available to meet the needs of the domestic market  before exports from such projects are allowed.    The country has vast mineral resources, but mining small  deposits scattered all over the country poses problems for big  public sector ventures. The private sector can tap this market  with modest investments and short lead times.    Mining, being labour-intensive, can open up job  opportunities  in backward areas. Efforts will be made to promote small scale  mining in a scientific and efficient manner while safeguarding  vital environmental and ecological imperatives, says the  official statement.    The management of mineral resources has, therefore, to be  closely integrated with the overall strategy of development; and  exploitation of minerals is to be guided by long-term national  goals and perspectives. It is against this backdrop, the  Government has felt the need to spell out the features of its  new policy, the statement said. But the delay in the amendment  of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act 1957  has created some confusion in the field.    Admittedly, the country is not endowed with rich resources  of  high grade ores in strategic areas except bauxite and iron ore.  This underlines the need for adopting scientific mining,  together with beneficiation processes for economic utilisation  of the available mineral resources. Mineral economists however  agree that progress in this direction over the the past three  decades has been rather tardy except in some sectors.    Focus on future needs    At the same time, the Government has to keep in view the  future needs of defence and development and try to ensure  indigenous availability of basic and strategic minerals to avoid  disruption of supplies during emergency.    The national mineral policy has also focussed on aspects  like  sea-bed mining, development of proper inventory, linkage between  exploitation of minerals and development of mineral industry,  conservation of forest resources and protection of environment.    The Centre will consult the States before formulating legal  measures for the regulation of mines and the development of  mineral resources to ensure basic uniformity in mineral  administration and development of the industry in tune with the  national policy aims. The new policy aims at exploring mineral  wealth in the land and in the off-shore areas; developing  mineral resources taking into account the national and strategic  considerations and ensuring their adequate supply and best use  keeping in view the present needs and future requirements; and  promoting necessary linkages for smooth and uninterrupted  development of the mineral industry to meet domestic needs.    In the development of the mineral industry the role of the  Government, both Central and States, has been spelt out in the  1957 Act. This Act has been amended through an ordinance issued  recently to accommodate the reforms envisaged by the Centre in  this field. It is time the Government updates the national  mineral inventory before it opens up this sector to the private  sector, both domestic and foreign.    The Geological Survey of India (GSI) will be the principal  outfit for geological mapping and regional mineral resources  assessment including in its exclusive economic zone. It will  continue to be responsible to draw up action-oriented plans in  association with other agencies.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Proved and Total Reserves of Five Major Ores and Minerals(in million tonnes) |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Proved                   |Total Reserves           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bauxite                  |1,487                    |5,863                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Iron ore                 |10,384                   |21,799                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Iron ore magnesite       |4,506                    |13,732                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Manganese ore            |93                       |548                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chrome ore               |62                       |270                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Copper ore               |216                      |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Special attention will be given to the development of  strategic minerals through systematic investigation of various  potential sources of supply. Further, the focus will be on the  survey and exploration of minerals in which the country has a  poor or just adequate resource base.    Ecological problems    Environmental problems associated with mining activity,  particularly open cast mining, land subsidence in underground  mining, deforestation and atmospheric pollution call for  appropriate strategy for mitigation of their adverse effects on  the eco-system. The new policy says that mining operations shall  not ordinarily be taken up in identified ecologically fragile  and biologically rich areas. Strip mining in forest areas should  be avoided in accordance with prescribed norms and established  forestry practices shall form an integral part of mine  development strategy.    The research and development (RD) activities will  focus on  the entire gamut of activities from geological survey,  exploration, mining, beneficiation and extraction of minerals to  development of materials. The new policy seeks to promote  development of new technologies for conversion of existing  mineral resources into viable economic resources. Appropriate  technologies shall be developed to enable indigenous industries  to utilise the available resources and as substitutes for  minerals whose reserves are poor.    The RD efforts shall be directed to find new and  alternative  uses for minerals whose traditional demand is on the wane, says  the statement. Indigenous technology has to be upgraded through  R  D and adoption of technological innovations from abroad.  Research in mining methods shall also receive priority attention.    The liberalisation of imports and reduction of customs duty  on finished metals like copper, zinc and aluminium, has hit  companies like Hindustan [HCL] Copper, Hindustan Zinc [HZL] and  National Aluminium.    While the Government has dereserved 15 minerals, ilmenite,  siliminate and mica have been kept out of this list. Bauxite  also does not appear in the deleted list although India ranks  fifth among bauxite rich countries in the world.    According to Mr. I.G. Jhingran, Secretary to Union Ministry  of Mines, liberalisation of the mining policy will help  indigenous companies to foster closer ties with mineral-rich  Third World countries for joint exploration and development of  ore resources.    Hindustan Copper could explore the possibility of joining  hands with Zambia which has rich copper ore deposits for  exploration and tie up imports of the richer grade ores for  blending with its low grade material. It has acquired  considerable expertise in mining and smelting operations.  Similarly, HZL also could go global with its expertise skills to  find partners abroad to develop the mineral deposits in Third  World countries. HCL is now free to even enter the metal trade.  For expanding its Khetri copper smelter capacity from 35,000  tonnes to one lakh tonnes a year, it could source ore imports  from Zambia to make its products competitive in the market.    These public sector companies are moving from an era of  protection to a competitive market and they should tap all  avenues to make their operations economically viable. HZL is  exploring the scope for setting up a joint venture in Vietnam  for developing a gold ore deposit in collaboration with BRGM  [Geological and Mineral Research] of France.    Mr. A.C. Wadhawan, Chairman, HZL, says some Australian  companies have evinced interest in exploration activities for  base metal ores, including gold, in India. The finds in  Karnataka and other southern States are promising for further  evaluation and assessment. These projects for transition need  long gestation period.    If, meanwhile, LME zinc prices continue to drop, HZL may  find  itself in an unenviable position as the Government is unlikely  to give it any budgetary support to weather the storm. The  Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd., with special skills in  exploration activities, is facing a bleak future as it may run  out of business if foreign mining companies enter the field. It  will have to seek foreign collaboration for survival and  technology upgradation.    Its capacity utilisation has dropped in 1992-93 as the  public  sector mining companies are starved of funds. Even the GSI is  now being asked to gear up to become market-oriented and try to  earn its keep, at least partly. It now remains to be seen how  the mining reforms will help the development of this core  industry and whether it will lure foreign investment for the  industry's rapid development.      "

However, the price of North Sea Brent crude for March delivery slipped back towards the close of the market to end barely changed from Friday. Traders expressed the belief that the US proposals for an import tax, even if they came to nothing, could galvanise the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to take action to support oil prices. Indeed, initial steps by Mr Alirio Parra, Opec president, to secure agreement for a cut of around 1m barrels a day in Opec output for the second quarter seems to have formed a consensus. Nigeria indicated yesterday it would cut its production from its current output level which it says is 2.4m b/d. Overall Opec output remained high in January at 25.05m b/d according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, the trade publication, compared with the organisation's ceiling of 24.58m b/d. Market traders believe Opec could have problems making its next deal stick since members have signally failed to abide by the current programme of cuts. 'There is no doubting their seriousness over a production cut, but will they follow through and will it be 1m barrels?' said Mr Gary Ross, chief executive of Petroleum Industry Research Associates in New York. Nevertheless, hopes for a production cut by Opec members should support crude prices in the run-up to the next meeting on February 13. There is some doubt about whether refined product prices in Europe will benefit from any action by Opec as much as crude prices. Cambridge Energy Research Associates points to high product stocks, low demand and mild weather which have depressed prices. Algeria's state oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach and British Petroleum signed a Dollars 45m exploration agreement in Algiers at the weekend, Francis Ghiles reports.

0,FT924-9876 ,"FT924-9876 _AN-CKCCTAGIFT 921103   FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (7): Desert gas for electricity - Only politics mars Algeria's attractions      By FRANCIS GHILES   THE decision of Italy's state electricity company, ENEL, to sign a 20 year contract with Algeria's oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach, reinforces Italy's position as Algeria's principal overseas market for gas. The deal, for delivery of 4bn cubic metres of gas a year starting in 1995, also marks out Italy as the most exciting market for Algerian gas, especially as supplying gas for power stations demands more flexibility from the supplier than other types of contracts. The latest contract confirms the shift in attitude of Sonatrach, a company which has, since 1988, increasingly come to recognise the mutual benefit to be gained from working together with international oil and gas companies and sharing the benefits of their combined resources. The rush of oil companies signing exploration deals with Sonatrach continues. So high is the chance of any company finding gas rather than oil that it was only earlier this year, when exploration terms for gas were improved to an acceptable level, that major oil companies decided the risk was worth taking. The new hydrocarbons law passed last December was the personal achievement of Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the former Minister of Energy, who left the government after the assassination of President Mohamed Boudiaf last June. The policies he promoted have, however, been strongly endorsed by the new minister, Mr Hasen Mefti, and the Prime Minister, Mr Belaid Abdesslem. From 1965 to 1977 Mr Abdesslem was the architect of Algeria's energy policy. Since the new law was passed, Sonatrach has signed exploration agreements with Occidental Petroleum, Total, Arco, Mobil, Phillips Petroleum and BP and an important service contract with Halliburton. These come on top of contracts with Total, Cepsa, Agip and Repsol. Apart from the political factor, nearly everything else in Algeria is attractive. The political uncertainty comes from the continuing violence between Islamic fundamentalists groups and the security forces following the cancelling of Algeria's first multiparty elections last January. These events have not affected the guarantees the US, Japan and France are prepared to give for exim-type loans whose proceeds are earmarked for the revamping and extension of the country's existing gas liquefying capacity. Nearly Dollars 1bn worth of loans to this effect have been signed this month. Conditions have changed on two fronts simultaneously. First, Algerian terms for exploration have become more rewarding for gas. Companies searching for oil and finding gas now have a realistic chance of getting a return on their exploration investment. As a result some companies might be willing specifically to look for gas. Another dimension of the new law is that it creates investment opportunities for foreign companies able to enhance production from Algeria's existing oil and gas fields. Rates of recovery had fallen below 20 per cent because Sonatrach lacked the same degree of international experience gained by global operators. Like many countries in the 1970s and the early 1980s, Algeria's drive to assert its own sovereignty over all oil and gas production excluded it from the advanced technology that less closed third world countries such as Indonesia were able to enjoy. Meanwhile, external demand for Algerian gas has grown beyond Sonatrach's current ability to supply it. Sonatrach is also lucky in another respect. As James Ball, director of Gas Matters points out, in a world where greenfield liquefied natural gas projects cost Dollars 4bn for a couple of trains of LNG able to produce 5bn cubic metres of gas a year, the prospect of increasing capacity by 10bn cubic metres a year for half this outlay must be as frightening to competitors as it is comforting to customers. Through the renovation and upgrading project being carried out by the same three companies that built the LNG plants in the late 1960s and 1970s, M. W. Kellogg and Bechtel of the US and Sofregaz of France will increase capacity at LNG plants in Arzew and Skikda from 19bn cubic metres to 32bn cubic metres. Meanwhile, the capacity of the nine year-old trans-Mediterranean pipeline which brings gas to Italy through Tunisia and the Straits of Sicily is being increased from 16bn to 24bn cubic metres. Two or three extra pumping stations in Algeria could boost that figure further. Exports to Spain are to increase and the first supplies are to reach Morocco. Spain, a long established buyer of Algerian LNG, committed itself earlier this spring to continuing its imports at the current level once the gas pipeline scheduled to run through Morocco and under the Straits of Gibraltar is completed. It is to supply Spain with 6bn-7bn cubic metres a year from 1997. The dramatic rise in Spain's gas requirement is largely driven by a policy decision to freeze the nuclear programme in favour of gas fired power. A further 1bn cubic metres will be bought by Morocco. Agreements have already been signed to supply LNG to Turkey and Greece, while newcomers such as Portugal and Germany have expressed interest in buying Algerian gas. The collapse of the US market for LNG, the latest possible victim being a 2.4bn cubic metres contract Sonatrach had signed with Shell US, will free some extra supply for such customers and potential Central European buyers. All in all, Sonatrach has set itself a ceiling of 60bn cubic metres of exports a year by the second half of the 1990s, with commitments of 56bn cubic metres already made. In addition to traditional oil and gas sales, a significant number of spin offs have produced new joint venture opportunities. One of the first such ventures was that between L'Air Liquide, Air Products and Sonatrach to extract helium from the gas stream going into the LNG plants. A much larger joint venture is the expansion of liquid petroleum gas export facilities at Arzew. It encompasses the expansion of the existing 'Jumbo' LPG plant and the increasing of production as a result of an upstream field enhancement project in which Total is playing a key role. The Algerians can only hope political uncertainty will not bedevil their plans, particularly at a time when political and other uncertainties make Russian gas far less secure than it was until the break up of the USSR. Algeria has a window of opportunity which those who manage its oil and gas industry seem intent on exploiting to the full.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            ALGERIAN GAS EXPORT COMMITMENTS AND POSSIBILITIES                   (billion cubic metres per annum)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BUYER                 LNG       LNG            PIPELINE    PIPELINE                       Now firm  possible 1995  firm 1995   possible 1997  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gaz de France          10.3       10.3 Enagas                  3.8        3.8                        6-7 Distrigaz (Belgium)     4.5        4.5 Distrigas (US)          1.25       1.3 Trunkline (US)          1.0        nil Shell Cove Point (US)*  2.4        nil Botas (Turkey)          2.0        3-4 DEPA (Greece)           0.7        0.7 Portugal                           1.8 Italy (SNAM)                       1.4-3         25.25       25.25 Italy (ENEL)                       1.0            4.0         4-6 Northern Europe                    4.0 Slovenia                                          0.6         1.0 Tunisia                                           0.7         1.0 Morocco                                                       1.0 Others                             3.9 TOTAL                  26.39      34.9-43.5      30.55       38.25-41.25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Subject to discussions between Shell and Columbia Gas System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SOURCE: GAS MATTERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page IV  "

Up to now a total of 34 oil-gas fields have been found with  a  proved oil-bearing area of over 1,200 square kilometers in the  three basins of Junggar, Tarim and Turpan.    Scattered in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region, the basins cover a total area of 740,000 square  kilometers.    Scientists from home and other countries have proved that  the  basins have good generative conditions for oil and natural gas.    They predicted that reserves in the basins hold billions of  tons of oil, about one-fourth of the total onshore oil resources  in China.    In the early 1980s, China began its efforts to find new oil  resources in the western part of the country as part of the  country's oil development strategy.    Since then, a large-scale oil prospecting and exploration  campaign involving big investment has started on the Gobi Desert  of Xinjiang.    Local petroleum scientists said that oil prospecting and  development there has entered a very active and fruitful period.    Some nine new oil and natural gas fields have been  discovered  in the 130,000-square-kilometer Junggar Basin in northern  Xinjiang in the past ten years, including Xiazijie, Huoshaoshan,  Beisantai, Cainan, Shixi and Mahu.    In the Tarim Basin, which is 560,000 square kilometers in  area, nine oil-gas fields have been found in the last five years.    Six new oil-gas fields have been discovered in the Turpan  Basin, though prospecting and exploration started only three  years ago.    Now 18 oil-gas fields have been built or are under  construction in the three basins. They have had a production  capacity of 11.79 million tons of crude oil annually.    Petroleum geologists have made surveys of deep geological  structures of the three basins and discovered 75 large  oil-bearing structures. And beginning this year there will be a  ""peak stage"" when more oil-gas reserver will be found in the  three basins.    Now there are over 50,000 oil workers and over 100 drilling  and geological teams working in the basins. The prospecting is  expanding and wells are being sunk deeper, from 3,000 meters to  more than 6,000 meters.     "

The basic industry sector includes eight [number as heard]  branches: the production of oil, nickel, glass, paper and paste,  as well as chemistry and mining geology, which have been offered  to potential investors over the past few years for exploitation.    As a result of these negotiations, thus far, Cuba has signed  26 contracts for mineral exploration and exploitation, two for  administrative functions, one for the exploitation of copper in  Pinar del Rio Province, and two partnerships have been  established to conduct feasibility studies of gold, lead, and  zinc deposits.    These agreements, which cover 50 percent of the area up for  bid, include work over an area of approximately 40,000 square km  of national territory; they do not include agreements for the  exploration and extraction of oil. This is another branch of  the basic industry that has made serious progress in the field  of partnerships between the state-owned Cuba Petroleum and  foreign firms.    Regarding oil exploration, 16 of the 33 high expectation  blocks into which the country has been divided, have already  been contracted to French, Canadian, British, and Swedish firms  and, according to Basic Industries Minister Marco Portals, all  of the blocks will have been contracted out by the end of the  year.    The nickel industry, meanwhile, is in the process of  increasing its production after a strong decline that began  following the severing of ties with Eastern Europe, which was  its primary buyer. Cuba diversified its nickel markets and today  exports the mineral to 26 countries. Thanks to economic  partnerships with Canada, The Netherlands, Great Britain, and  Italy, and the efficiency of Cuban specialists and technicians,  production will increase this year. Thus, the growth of vital  branches such as oil, nickel, and cobalt production is  guaranteed by economic partnerships with foreign firms, none of  which, in fact, are from the United States.    Therefore, the economic blockade it decreed against Cuba has  backfired on the United States, which is now deprived of  participation in attractive business opportunities.     "
0,FT934-15083 ,"FT934-15083 _AN-DJMCRAF1FT 931013   FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Swedish gold miner aims to up the stakes - A small but profitable business that is coming to market      By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES   THE UNLIKELY site for Europe's largest gold mine is a place called Bjorkdal only 300km south of the Arctic circle in northern Sweden. Until now it has enjoyed an obscurity to match its remote location, but that will change next month when the mine's operator, Terra Mining, comes to the Swedish stock market, with a range of international institutions among its new owners. The company says it will be Europe's only listed mining group concerned purely with gold. Bjorkdal claims its status as Europe's leading gold mine with 1992 production of 2,310kg (74,250 troy ounces) and expected output of 2,475kg this year. Since it started production in 1988, total output has amounted to 9 tonnes. On the scale of the world's biggest gold mines, such as those in South Africa, this is insignificant, representing a mere one-tenth of 1 per cent of total annual gold output worldwide. But Terra Mining prides itself not on scale of production but on the efficiency and profitability of its operations. Its production costs are lower than 90 per cent of its western world rivals, with mine site cash costs dropping to Dollars 145 an ounce in 1993 from Dollars 209 last year. The improvement will help the company to achieve a pre-tax profit of SKr71m (Pounds 5.75m), a 35 per cent margin on sales of SKr202.3m and a level of profitability that will match the very best in the Swedish corporate sector. Part of the reason for the low cost base has been the dramatic strengthening of the US dollar against the Swedish krona from an average of SKr5.83 in 1992 to SKr7.75 this year - a significant boost for a company that has virtually all its expenses in krona and all its revenues in dollars. But it is also lean in terms of staff numbers - it employs just 45 people - and it has benefited from the efficiency of both its exploration and its mining techniques. The company prides itself on the effectiveness of its exploration technique, which uses modern data-processing methods and an understanding of the movement of glaciers during the last ice age to find commercial ore deposits. Analysis of the glacial till, the layer of terrain that collected small fragments of minerals as they were scraped off the underlying bedrock by glaciers, is at the heart of the process. Modern data processing allows huge numbers of deposits from many different areas to be analysed systematically. In this way Terra Mining has tested 150,000 samples for 30 different elements (a total of 4.5m analyses) from a grid covering nearly all of Sweden and parts of Finland, Norway and Ireland. The company has spent SKr100m on exploration since it was founded in 1980, and had spent only SKr30m by the time it identified the potential of Bjorkdal in 1983. It took just five years from the moment a claim was first lodged on the mine to the time production started - a short lead time by industry standards. The fact that the mine is open cast, rather than underground, helps to keep operating costs down. It has also modified its mining methods, changing bench height, blast size, and drilling patterns to enhance metallurgical recovery. The result has been a steady improvement in the ore grade from 2.56 grams of gold a tonne in 1990 to 3.31 grams this year, although this is still lower than a typical South African mine. Further efficiency has been achieved by tripling the amount of ore treated annually from 300,000 tonnes in 1988 to 900,000 tonnes today. The amount is not likely to rise any further, as the company is restricted under the terms of its concession to a maximum production of 1m tonnes of ore a year. Even when the gold price plunged to the equivalent of SKr56,000 a kilogram in July 1992 Bjorkdal remained profitable, with a break-even level of SKr51,000. When the gold price soars to SKr107,000 a kilogram - as it did this year, with a built-in benefit from the krona's devaluation - it is highly profitable, and remains so at the SKr92,000 level which prevailed at the end of September. Perhaps Terra Mining's biggest problem, from a potential investor's viewpoint, is that it has just one mine in operation at present, and one with only seven years of proven and probable reserves at that. The mine's president, Mr Torsten Borjemalm, is sensitive to this, but he brushes the criticism aside. 'How many other industries have an order stock of seven years? We know we have material to sell - it's only a question of price,' he says. Not only is the company confident that Bjorkdal's 'possible' reserves will extend its life further, it also has 60 other prospects on its books and expects to have at least one more mine, and possibly two, in operation by the year 2000. The most important exploration project is at Pahtavaara in Finland, which has proven reserves of 695,000 tonnes at a grade of 3.33 grams a tonne. A final decision on whether to develop this mine will be taken next year. Another interesting deposit is at Barsele in Sweden. It is partly because of the need to fund new mining developments that the company and its owners now want to broaden Terra's ownership base when it is listed. They will sell up to 1.3m shares at SKr140 a share. Norsk Hydro, the majority shareholder with 61 per cent, is to sell about 30 per cent of its stake as are the other two big shareholders, Euroventures Nordica and Mr Christer Lofgren, one of the company's founders. Presentations have been held in London, Paris, Stockholm and Edinburgh as part of the campaign to attract new owners from the Swedish and international investment community.

If correct, the new Saudi numbers would boost by about 10% the free world's  proven reserves of crude oil to the 900-billion-barrel range. This would tend  to prolong the oil era and underscore the reliance of industrialized nations on  the Middle East.    Some Saudi watchers said the dramatic upward revision is legitimate and  overdue, while others said it was at least partly inspired by the politics of  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Both views might be correct,  analysts said.    ""This was a political announcement. On the other hand, they may well have the  oil,"" said William D. Dietzman, a retired Energy Department geologist who has  studied the Saudi oil fields for the U.S. government.    Several other OPEC nations, including Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Venezuela, have  also increased their own oil reserve estimates sharply in the past year. The  higher a country's reserves, the greater its influence and production quota in  OPEC. Within the oil community, Iran's claims are widely discounted while the  others are accepted to varying degrees.    The Saudis, through their Arabian American Oil Co., or Aramco, said that six  years of studies at their new oil exploration and engineering computer center  showed that they have 252.4 billion barrels of proven crude oil underground and  177.3 trillion cubic feet of gas.      U.S. Estimates Similar    For many years, the official Saudi government number was 110 billion barrels.  But since at least 1975, the scientific community has carried Saudi Arabia on  its books as having 150 billion to 170 billion barrels, the estimate varying  annually with oil prices, discoveries and production levels.    The U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va., said its estimate a year ago was 167  billion barrels, similar to the Saudis' own numbers at that time. The USGS put  the natural gas estimate at 130 trillion cubic feet, while Aramco had  previously estimated 141 trillion.    Dietzman and others said the timing of the announcement dramatically boosting  the Saudis' official oil reserve estimate strongly suggests that it was  inspired by the need to hold their ground within OPEC for the purposes of  determining quotas.    ""They're saying, if Iraq says it has 100 billion barrels, then we say we have  250 billion,"" Dietzman said.    Even without the political element, any assessment of how much oil is  underground and how much of it can be recovered with known technology and  current prices is inexact. But in Saudi Arabia, the reserves are considered so  large that it is hard to challenge any estimate.    Consultant Joseph Story of McLean, Va., a former Aramco executive, said there  is so much oil in Saudi Arabia that until recently, not much effort has been  expended at determining just how much there is.    But skyrocketing oil prices in the late 1970s and early 1980s prompted Saudi  Arabia to spend some of the financial windfall on establishing a  state-of-the-art oil exploration and engineering center in Dhahran in 1982 that  is the envy of oil geologists.    Aramco, calling the latest estimates ""very conservative,"" said the work done at  the Dhahran center is the basis for the big increase in the official reserve  estimates.    ""There was no need to look for oil. But now they've put a lot of money into  upgrading their seismic capabilities and into exploration activity,"" said  Story, president of Gulf Consulting Services Inc. ""The point of this is, the  numbers are probably true. But in announcing it, they might also be trying to  alleviate any worries that there are going to be shortages any time soon.""    The more plentiful the supplies of low-cost crude oil such as Saudi Arabia's,  the lower prices are likely to remain. However, the Middle East oil fields --  which already account for about 70% of free world oil reserves -- are expected  to account for a steadily increasing share as other producing countries such as  the United States run low.    Aramco, once a joint venture of the Saudi government and the U.S. oil giants  Exxon, Mobil, Chevron and Texaco, operates Saudi Arabia's oil fields.

And It Is""]    [Text] Havana -- Gold, that highly coveted mineral which  has cost the life of more than one person, also benefits Cuba  with its presence in at least five of the country's regions, two  of which look like good prospects. The authorities see the new  possibility of gold production opening up for Cuba as a means of  diversifying national production and at the same time as another  source of revenue and another opportunity to trade with foreign  investors.    According to Jose Casa de Valle, technical director of the  Geological-Mining Union of Cuba, the possibilities of producing  the valuable metal in Cuba are excellent because he considers it  to be highly profitable, especially in the Pinar del Rio region  where the mining process has already begun.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the official said they  expect to produce 300 kg in 1994 from the Castellanos deposit in  Pinar del Rio, in the western part of the country, and 500 kg  per year is expected in the near future.    He said a sulfometals [sulfometales] plant there was adapted  to obtain gold ingots through mass lixiviation. The final  product is 99.999-percent pure gold.    From that deposit, he added, 1 to 1.5 grams of gold per ton  are extracted, which is the average measure for gold.    He said they are conducting gold exploration and  exploitation  on their own, without foreign investments, at that plant. In the  case of polymetals [polimetales], such as lead, zinc, and other  minerals, however, we are exploring the Pinar del Rio zone with  help from foreign companies, mainly Canadian.    When asked about the participation of foreign companies in  the exploration and exploitation of minerals in the country,  Casa de Valle explained the island is divided into 37 blocks for  geological prospecting and more than 20 contracts have already  been signed with foreign investors, particularly Canadians, for  the random exploration of solid minerals.    That is also the case of Delita on the Isle of Youth; El  Descanso in Villa Clara, in the central part of the country;  Jobabo in eastern Camaguey Province; and Aguas Claras in Holguin.    The executive, with 27 years of experience in the field,  thinks the deposit at Delita is the most promising because,  according to geological studies, it is currently the largest ore  deposit in the country.    Notwithstanding, gold mining there is complicated because  the  mineral is mixed with large quantities of arsenic, an  undesirable element from every point of view.    He said: The exploitation of that deposit is being  negotiated  with foreign companies, and the research was carried out by  Cuban specialists.    He explained: We believe that if those investments are made  within two or three years, Delita will yield between 2.5 to 3  tons of gold per year.    He said the remaining deposits, El Descanso and Melonera, in  Villa Clara, are currently in the research phase. They are  relatively small but they have a high content of the mineral.    He thinks the region is the most promising as far as gold  discovery is concerned. Canadian companies are conducting  explorations at random there, but there is still no final  evaluation.    Casa de Valle reiterated that the prospects in that zone are  vast because conditions are similar to the deposit in Nevada,  United States, and Pueblo Viejo, in the Dominican Republic.    In referring to the Aguas Claras mine in eastern Holguin  Province, the specialist said negotiations are under way with  foreign companies to explore areas around that mine since it is  presumed it contains gold. Until recently, and even prior to  1959, molten gold was taken from that region to Pinar del Rio,  where it was processed. The reserve ran out some time ago,  however, and mining stopped.    Speaking about the island's gold prospects, which is so  useful in the electronic's industry because it is an excellent  electricity conductor and is rustproof, Casa de Valle said  mining and processing were highly profitable in Pinar del Rio  because investments there had been minimal (between $6 million  to $8 million). Delita is also considered profitable despite the  complexity of the zone, given its proximity to the sea. It  requires an investment of between $40 and $50 million but the  gold there could be exploited for at least 20 years. He said  that with these prospects, the country will soon become one of  Latin America's gold producers, led by Chile, Brazil, and Peru,  among other nations.     "

In response to Chinese accusations that Vietnam had been  harassing its oil survey vessels, a Foreign Ministry statement  said the area in question was entirely within Vietnam's  exclusive economic zone and had been never been part of the  Spratly Islands.    The statement implicitly denied any harassment of Chinese  vessels, saying that Vietnam had only been carrying out  legitimate survey work completely within its rights.    ""China should not make declarations or carry out acts that  violate Vietnam's incontestable sovereignty over this area,"" the  statement said, adding that this would not help efforts to  improve relations or secure peace in the region.    Vietnam has accused China of acting illegally by granting  Crestone Energy Corp. a concession to explore in a huge swathe  of the South China Sea that includes what the Vietnamese call  the Tu Chinh area.    ""Declarations that the Tu Chinh area lies within the  maritime  zone of the Spratly Islands and China's signature of an oil  exploration contract with Crestone run contrary to legal  principles and international conventions, in particular the 1982  Law of the Sea,"" the statement said.    Vietnam's parliament is expected to ratify the UN maritime  law during its session this month in a move seen as boosting  Hanoi's legal arsenal in the dispute. [passage omitted covered  by referent item]    Both sides have repeatedly pledged to resolve the dispute  over the Spratly and Paracel islands through negotiations and  avoid a repetition of the brief naval clash they fought in 1988.    But stepped up oil exploration across the area and new  technology that enables oil firms to drill cheaper wells in deep  waters is threatening to complicate the problem.    Oil firms here have downplayed the risk of confrontation,  saying that they are more concerned over whether the promising  geology under the South China Sea will actually yield commercial  quantities of oil and gas.

Turning away from a capital immersed in its latest budget battle, President  Bush on Friday set his sights on Mars.    He renewed his commitment to landing Americans on the planet -- and for the  first time set a public deadline for the mission: July 20, 2019, the 50th  anniversary of the first moon landing by U.S. astronauts in the Apollo space  program. But he did not say how the multibillion-dollar centerpiece of his new  ""Age of Exploration"" would be financed.    ""It's time to open up the final frontier. There can be no turning back,"" Bush  said.    ""I believe that before Apollo celebrates the 50th anniversary of its landing on  the moon, the American flag should be planted on Mars,"" the President said in a  commencement address at Texas A&I University here.    While the President's deadline for a landing on Mars does not amount to a firm  commitment to spend the necessary billions of dollars that will be needed to  achieve the goal -- that commitment can be accomplished only with the  cooperation of Congress -- his fiscal 1991 budget has asked for a 24% increase  in spending for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the largest  increase in funding for any major government agency next year. Under the  President's plan, NASA would receive $15.2 billion in the fiscal year beginning  Oct. 1.    Bush's renewed focus on Mars, and space exploration in general, reflects a  commitment he made last July 20, on the 20th anniversary of man's arrival on  the moon, to return America to the business of space exploration and to send a  manned spaceship to Mars.    At that point, however, he set no timetables or budgets for the Mars mission,  directing Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, to  work out the details.    The President also has set a goal of placing an operating space station in  permanent orbit around Earth by the end of the century as the first step toward  a permanent manned presence in space. He called for establishing sometime  afterward a manned laboratory on the moon.    The Mars mission would cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next three  decades -- one estimate has it costing $30 billion to $35 billion annually --  and would culminate in a dangerous space voyage of two to three years.    Asked aboard Air Force One as he was about to leave Washington for Texas  whether the United States could indeed reach his Mars goal in 30 years, he  replied: ""You have to go fairly fast. It's a long way out there.""    As for where the money would come from, he replied, ""Thirty years is a long  time.""    The risks of the journey are awesome: The astronauts' spaceship could collide  with a meteoroid that could cause rapid decompression -- and death; violent  storms on the surface of the sun could blast them with deadly radiation, if  their craft is unprotected, and the team could be forced to spend a year on  Mars, waiting for the planet to be aligned properly with Earth to allow them to  return.    For his speech Friday, Bush chose a 65-year-old university in the southern tip  of Texas, a state heavily involved with the aerospace industry. Texas A&I  has an enrollment of nearly 6,000 students, 57% of whom are Latino. It  graduated 407 students Friday.

The discovery is the biggest in the US for 20 years, opening up the potential of the Gulf region which the industry believes could be another North Sea. The Mars discovery, at a depth of 3,100 feet, makes it one of the deepest commercially-viable oilfields. The only other field of this depth under development is Shell's Auger operation nearby. British Petroleum, which has a one-third interest in the Mars field, said it was 'potentially the biggest prospect in which the company has participated since the discovery of its major North Sea fields'. Shell said further engineering studies were required before it could estimate the full size of the find, but industry observers believe it to rank among the world's 'giant' finds which contain 1bn barrels of oil or more. The largest oilfield in the UK sector of the North Sea is the Forties field which is estimated to contain 2.5bn barrels. Oil could be produced from the Mars discovery within five years of starting development, the company said yesterday. Mr John Browne, head of exploration at BP, said the find 'obviously has great significance for the industry because it is the first time an operator has announced a discovery at these depths'. The depth of the Gulf of Mexico - North Sea fields are 600 to 700 feet deep  -makes it more complicated and expensive to develop, requiring the latest oilfield technology. One industry expert estimates that costs could be double those of the North Sea where it takes about Dollars 3.40 to produce a barrel of oil. Oil revenue taxes in the US are much lower than in the UK, however, and the discoveries will be more profitable. The development of deep-sea technology to exploit these oil finds has implications for the area of the North Sea, west of Shetland, where exploration could begin in several years.

It will also begin the spade work for  the Presidential and National Assembly elections.    This was announced by President Sam Nujoma at a State House  news conference on Wednesday. Many Namibians have complained  about the availability of land and the disproportionate  distribution of available arable land. A Land Conference was  held in Windhoek in 1991, to find solutions to the land hunger.    The President vowed to pursue closer cooperation in conflict  resolution to ensure stability for the common interests of the  region. ""Although our country enjoys relative peace and  stability, we cannot be indifferent to the sufferings of  others,"" President Nujoma told the press conference.    Nujoma reviewed development progress in the past year and  said the government would continue to consolidate and strengthen  the foundations of political, economic and social development.  He declared that education would take priority in his  government until the day he died.    ""We have now embarked upon an irreversible path towards  national building, a step that has led to sound investment  opportunity and socio-economic upliftment of our people.""  President Nujoma highlighted successes in road infrastructural  development, oil and gas exploration, fisheries and regional  cooperation.    He welcomed the reintegration of Walvis Bay, stating that  the  port town would become a major centre for regional cooperation  and would give great impetus to the growth of the Namibian  economy. At independence, the government initiated the  formidable task of turning Namibia's transport network towards a  much more favourable east-west direction.    Five major road projects have been implemented and some of  the new links are to be completed within the next three years.    On petroleum exploration and production, remarkable progress  has also been achieved. Realising that the petroleum industry  is a hazardous one, the government has established an emergency  plan. It is developing oil and gas regulations regarding  health, safety and the protection of the environment, during  exploration and production activities. Pre-feasibility studies  for Epupa hydro-electric scheme have been completed and the  feasibility study phase is to commence soon.    President Nujoma expressed satisfaction with the growth of  the fishing industry, which he described as the second largest  industrial employer. The President noted that industrialists  had made substantial foreign exchange earnings the past year and  there would be no deterioration in the country's balance of  payments. He said he foresaw greater investment and job  opportunities being created by all these developments.     "

He has filled two of the most sensitive portfolios - justice and education - with men the late President Mohamed Boudiaf, assassinated three weeks ago, would have wished to see at the posts. Professor Ahmed Djebbar, the new minister of education, returned to Algeria six months ago with the former president after several years of exile in France. Mr Abdelhamid Mahi-Bahi, the justice minister, was state prosecutor in the western town of Oran. Mr Abdessalam retained seven ministers from the outgoing government. They include Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the respected foreign minister, who two years ago brokered a measure of peace in Lebanon; Mr Abdenour Keramane, the minister for industry; Mr Farouk Tebbal, minister of housing; and General Khaled Nezzar who, as minister of defence and member of the five-man collegiate presidency, appears to be a key player in Algeria. Mr Hacen Mefti, a senior manager of the state oil and gas monopoly Sonatrach, replaces Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine as minister of energy. The latter piloted a more liberal oil and gas exploration bill through a hostile national assembly last December and recently presided over the signing of exploration agreements with Atlantic Richfield, Mobil Oil, Phillips Petroleum and British Petroleum. Mr Laoussine had asked to step down. Mr Mohamed Hardi, a civilian, takes over the Interior Ministry where he will be seconded by Colonel Mohamed Tolba. This marks the exit, from the government at least, of General Laarbi Belkheir, a close associate of former President Chadli Bendjedid. Mr Hardi has worked closely with Mr Reda Malek, who was co-opted into the collegiate presidency after the death of Mr Boudiaf and the appointment of Mr Ali Kafi as acting head of state. The five men have publicly ruled out running for the post of president in any future election. Mr Messaoud Ait-Chaalal, who becomes a special adviser to Mr Abdessalam, is a former Algerian ambassador.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The commission voted unanimously to approve the remarks, which brand the  proposed federal rules as inequitable and significantly weaker than  pollution-control standards enforced on land.    Noting that prevailing winds in California's coastal area blow toward shore,  bringing offshore pollutants onto the land, the 47-page report drafted by the  state agency's staff suggested that new oil rigs could add to pollution  problems in parts of Southern California already burdened by the worst air  quality in the nation.    The document represents perhaps the harshest and most wide-ranging assault on  the federal air-quality plan for offshore oil operations issued by the  Department of the Interior in January.    ""I think they'll take our comments seriously,"" said Susan Hansch, the  commission's energy and ocean resources manager. ""As they are written now,  these rules promise only to exacerbate the serious existing problem with  onshore air pollution.""      No Comment From U.S.    Department of the Interior officials in Washington could not be reached for  comment Tuesday. Officials of the agency's Mineral Management Service in Los  Angeles said they had not seen the commission's remarks and declined comment.    But, at a Coastal Commission workshop Monday, an Interior Department official  said the federal agency would carefully consider the commission's remarks along  with others received before the April 17 deadline for comments on the proposed  regulations.    ""This rule is not cast in stone,"" said Michael Poling, a deputy assistant  secretary of Interior. ""What we have is a starting point.""    Although the recent oil-tanker accident in Prince William Sound off the Alaskan  coast has focused attention on the dire effects of spills, air pollution from  oil exploration and operations represents an equally vexing environmental  threat, experts contend.    If an Interior Department plan to lease oil tracts in federal waters off the  Southern California coast goes forward, a fleet of new platforms would sprout  from the sea, each belching pollution during drilling operations and attracting  a swarm of support ships to add to the smog, critics argue.    The federal drilling proposal for California waters is on hold while a  presidential task force studies the offshore oil issue, but some state and  local officials remain concerned that the plan could be revived, and many see  the air-quality issue as perhaps the best avenue of attack.    The proposed federal rules stem from nearly a decade of unsuccessful efforts to  devise a palatable strategy for con    trolling pollution from oil rigs off California.    In 1981, the state sued the Interior Department over the issue. As a result,  negotiations were launched in 1986 among officials of local, state and federal  governments, industry and environmental groups. After two years, however, a  consensus had not been reached, and the Interior Department dropped the effort  and set about drafting the existing proposal.    Aside from criticizing the proposed rule as ""significantly weaker"" than onshore  pollution regulations, the commission suggested that the plan would allow broad  exemptions and disrupt efforts to meet air-quality standards on land.    Under the regulations, thousands of tons of nitrogen oxides would be permitted,  causing ""an adverse impact far exceeding any gains"" that some regions would  hope to make by regulating pollution sources such as factories and automobiles,  according to a commission report.    The result would be ""deteriorated human health, deteriorated agricultural  productivity, and economic and social costs,"" including possible bans on  industrial and residential development on the coast, the report said.      Notable Exemptions    Among the exemptions in the federal rule is air pollution emitted by support  vessels as well as ships and equipment used by oil companies during exploration  and construction of offshore platforms, it said.    If the exemptions are allowed, more than 1,000 tons of nitrogen oxides will be  permitted in each air basin along the coast, according to the report. That load  of pollution is the equivalent of adding 125,000 cars traveling 10,000 miles a  year to a region's roads.    Moreover, construction of a typical dual-platform project would result in about  620 tons of nitrogen oxides in a year, equal to adding 77,500 vehicles  traveling 10,000 miles, the report said.    The commission report also said the federal standards lack strong monitoring  and enforcement provisions and leave too broad a decision-making role to the  regional director of the federal Minerals Management Agency, the oil  exploration arm of the Department of the Interior.    The report also criticizes the Department of the Interior for suggesting that  an environmental review of the proposed rule is not needed because it ""does not  constitute a major federal action affecting the quality of the human  environment.""

That load  of pollution is the equivalent of adding 125,000 cars traveling 10,000 miles a  year to a region's roads.    Moreover, construction of a typical dual-platform project would result in about  620 tons of nitrogen oxides in a year, equal to adding 77,500 vehicles  traveling 10,000 miles, the report said.    The commission report also said the federal standards lack strong monitoring  and enforcement provisions and leave too broad a decision-making role to the  regional director of the federal Minerals Management Agency, the oil  exploration arm of the Department of the Interior.    The report also criticizes the Department of the Interior for suggesting that  an environmental review of the proposed rule is not needed because it ""does not  constitute a major federal action affecting the quality of the human  environment.""

Rowland has predicted that a slight drop might occur next year, but he warned  that the worst is yet to come for the expanding hole in the ozone shield  because of the delayed reaction of the chemicals. The hole in the layer --  which protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation -- is expected to  continue to expand until at least 2010, even if controls now in place are  effective.    The world's major industrialized nations agreed in the 1987 Montreal Protocol  to cut use of CFCs in half by the end of the century.

The most recent  report, which compares results at more than 60 sites through June, 1990, was  presented Monday at an annual conference of the American Geophysical Union in  San Francisco.

Use of the industrial chemical in 1988 was about three times greater than in  1976, according to Rowland's data. It is now about equal to emissions from the  two other major CFCs that are used mostly in air conditioners and refrigerators  and as blowing agents during the manufacture of foam and polystyrene.

The meeting takes place against a backdrop of the continuing territorial disputes involving three Asean members - China, Vietnam and Taiwan - over the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea, a quarrel which could deteriorate shortly with the expected start of oil exploration in the area. The foreign ministers' gathering is their first since the January accord among the six Asean governments - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei - to transform the region into a free-trade area by 2007. They will discuss ways to strengthen Asean's ability to cope with a changing international environment and then discuss trends in trade, investment and development with counterparts from their main economic partners: the EC, US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Raul Manglapus, chairman of the Asean Standing Committee and Philippines Foreign Affairs Secretary, said yesterday that the Spratley disputes will also be discused. The three Asean members involved - Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines - and China, Vietnam and Taiwan all have claims on the islands. With the exception of Brunei, all also have troops on some of the islands, under which may lie oil and gas reserves. China and Vietnam have awarded contracts separately to western companies to drill for oil in the disputed territories, and Vietnam recently increased its campaign by wooing Malaysia to participate in one exploration venture. Over the past few weeks, China is said to have planted a territorial marker on a reef and had earlier authorised its army to use force, if necessary, to control the islands. Nevertheless, Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, has been invited to the Manila meetings and is expected to hold talks with his Asean counterparts as a group and individually. Mr Manglapus said this week's meetings will tackle 'some guidelines (that) will provide us with the start of a kind of modus vivendi between contesting nations before a final resolution is arrived at'. And, while analysts are not optimistic that a definitive end to the disputes can be reached this week, Mr Manglapus noted 'a strong feeling on the part of our partners (for) a peaceful solution.'

However, group operating revenue rose to NKr1.26bn from NKr1.09bn, helped by higher petroleum production which rose to the equivalent of about 1m tonnes of oil. Operating profit fell to NKr280m from NKr393m. The reduction in operating profit was due largely to lower oil prices compared with the first quarter of 1991, which was affected by the Gulf war. There were increased costs relating to expansion in exploration activities and higher field depreciation. A royalty in the Oseberg (oil field) was also reflected in increased costs, the company said. Saga did not detail exploration costs but said that depreciation had risen by NKr81m to NKr279m. Group operating expenses rose to NKr977m from NKr694m. First-quarter crude oil sales were lifted to 6.4m barrels from 5.1m barrels in the same period last year. Saga said that it obtained an average sale price of NKr114 per barrel of oil in the first three months compared with NKr136 last year. To improve the company's financial structure, Saga said it issued a NKr1bn bond with a 10-year maturity in Norway in January. Exportfinans, the export credit guarantee bank owned by the commercial banks, reported a 19 per cent improvement in first-quarter operating profit to NKr87m from NKr73m last year. Exportfinans explained the increase was due to improvements in asset management and non-recurring income from certain financial transactions. The company said that as a result of balance sheet growth, its capital adequacy ratio declined from 21 per cent at year end to 16.7 per cent at end-March. Loans disbursed in the first quarter were 15 per cent up on last year and totalled NKr598m. Of that, about 65 per cent was extended on market terms while 35 per cent was government-supported credits. The grant element of mixed credits in 1992 was increased by NKr250m to NKr340m. This, and the adjustment of regulations governing maturities and the proportions that could be financed, provided the industry with a greater opportunity for contracts, the company said. It said there was increasing interest in export credits on market terms for exports to industrialised countries.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "

The remodeling will aim to cut costs and reinforce the H-2's  launch capability to assist various related projects, such as  construction of the Japanese space shuttle ""Hope"" and  exploration of the moon and other planets. Armed with funds  totalling approximately 11 billion yen in the draft budget for  fiscal 1994, NASDA plans to first change the design of the  engine and airframe.    As the H-2 rocket is capable of launching a 2-ton-class  satellite into geostationary orbit, projects have already been  worked out to use it to launch meteorological satellites and  other satellites capable of monitoring the global environment.  NASDA has also started to develop a prototype of an unmanned  space shuttle to be called Hope, which is scheduled to be  launched by H-2. Without modification, however, the H-2 will be  used in only a few, specialized areas and launch costs would be  nearly double those of other countries.    NASDA will, therefore, first try to cut manufacturing costs  and modify the design to simplify the pipe arrangements and  welding parts of the engine and airframe. It aims, reportedly,  to cut launch costs by 30 percent.    There are three different methods of reinforcing the  rocket's  launch capability: Increasing to six the two sets of solid fuel  rocket boosters (SRB) which add driving force; installing two  sets of a new type of booster which is composed of two units of  the LE-7 main engine; and installing two sets of boosters  composed of four units of the modified LE-7 engine, which uses  hydrocarbon as its fuel.    The capability of the H-2 rocket, which is capable only of  launching 10-ton-class satellites into a low-altitude orbit at  present, will be increased so that it can launch satellites of  15 tons, 17 tons, and 27 tons respectively.    The government's Space Activities Committee is now studying  a  long-term space development program. Projects connected with  future space activities in the 21st century are under discussion  now. Suggestions include, for example, carrying out various  space experiments on the HOPE, and also retrieving surface soil  from the Mars using exploration spacecraft. Teruo Sofue, a  staff member of the comprehensive development department at  NASDA, said: ""By reinforcing the H-2 rocket, we can expand the  range of space development. We would like to develop it into a  rocket capable of engaging in a number of activities.""     "

The company's solicitors added that they had been advised that Mr Thomas Meiklejohn, a former employee of Normandy, would also be charged. Normandy, which made the announcement after the stock market closed, said full details of the charges had not been disclosed but continued: 'It is understood that they relate to the takeover by Brunswick NL in 1989 of Bendigo Gold and that the charges allege that Mr de Crespigny and Mr Meiklejohn allegedly failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Part A statement delivered to Bendigo Gold shareholders did not contain misleading information. 'It is understood that Mr Meiklejohn is also to be charged for allegedly having knowingly published false information in relation to the financial position of Brunswick.' Brunswick started corporate life as Brunswick Oil, but sold its oil interests and moved into the gold exploration business in Western Australia. Control was then acquired by interests related to Mr de Crespigny who, in 1989, was chairman of the company. Mr Meiklejohn, at that time, was Brunswick's managing director. The merger with Bendigo Gold was agreed in 1990. A 'Part A' document is one of the offer documents formally required under Australian takeover practice  -and the one which tells shareholders in the target company about any information relevant to them in deciding whether to sell their shares. Mr de Crespigny, one of the most influential figures in Australia's mining industry, denied any wrongdoing. 'The laying of these is entirely unexpected and very disappointing,' he said in a statement. 'The DPP has never spoken to me nor made any serious attempt to canvass its concerns with me.' He said he was completely innocent of the charges and would defend them vigorously. He was confident of an acquittal, 'although clearly the laying of these charges is bound to cause me enormous personal damage'. Last night, Mr Andrew Corletto, Normandy's company secretary, said that he did not believe that the charges had actually been laid to date, although he conceded that it was possible this would happen before the holiday weekend.

Energy Undersecretary Rufino Bomasang said in the drilling  bulletin released yesterday that Anderman Smith Philippines  Inc., operator of the Cambayan well in onshore Mindoro,  encountered gas readings of propane at various intervals while  drilling.    Bomasang said the U.S.-based Anderman Smith has drilled the  Cambayan-1 well to a depth of 6,285 feet. The operator will  continue drilling this week. It is targeting to reach a depth  of 8,000 feet.    Anderman Smith is slated to drill two wells in Mindoro  within  the year requiring some $2 million in investment. The second  well will be drilled right after the first well.    Anderman Smith's partners in the exploration of the Cambayan  area in Mindoro are the PNOC [Philippine National Oil Company]  Exploration Corp., The Philodrill Corp., Basic Petroleum and  Minerals Corp., Terra Grande Resources and Exploration Inc.,  Vulcan Industrial and Mining Corp., and Anglo-Philippines Oil  and Mining Corp.    Still on oil exploration, Bomasang said the Australian oil  firm Ampolex Ltd. spudded the Villaba-1 well in offshore Leyte  last 1 May. Its drill ship, the ""Ocean Clipper,"" has drilled to  a depth of 1,723 feet. Ampolex is scheduled to drill to a depth  of 6,234 feet.    At the same time, the French Government through Trans Energy  has signed an agreement with the Energy Department of conduct a  technical and feasibility study for the setting up of a  liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in Luzon. [sentence as  published]    Bomasang said the project will not entail any cost on the  part of the government.    Trans Energy according to Bomasang, will also provide a gas  market profile for Luzon. He said that it was the French  Government that broached the idea of undertaking such a  feasibility study.    The French company has started a preliminary survey among  economic planners, policy makers, and different agencies  involved in power generation to assess the technical and  economic feasibility of setting up an LNG tanker facility.    The DOE is planning to tap natural gas as a source of energy  by the turn of the century especially with the ongoing  exploration at the Camago-Malampaya field in northwest Palawan.    Shell Philippine Exploration and Occidental Petroleum are  currently drilling a well at Camago-Malampaya to confirm  reserves of some two to five trillion cubic feet of gas.     "
0,FT944-3703 ,"FT944-3703 _AN-ELMDEADJFT 941212   FT  12 DEC 94 / Restored to health with new ambition: David Simon and John Browne describe BP's business strategy to Robert Corzine and David Lascelles      By ROBERT CORZINE and DAVID LASCELLES   Healing can be a slow process in the business world. It has taken British Petroleum two-and-a-half years to recover from the crisis of mid-1992 that led to the dramatic ousting of its former chairman Mr Robert Horton. Then, the UK's leading oil company cut its dividend as it struggled to reduce a Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.6bn) debt mountain and saw its share price plummet. This year, BP's shares have soared to record highs as the company paid its first dividend increase since 1992. Much of the credit for the turnround goes to Mr David Simon, the chief executive, who took over from Mr Horton after the boardroom coup. He describes the company as fully restored to health, but one with new ambitions. Since 1992, Mr Simon and his colleagues have kept a deliberately low profile while they worked to rebuild profits, repay billions of dollars of debt, sell off non-core businesses and refurbish the group's tarnished reputation. In contrast to the expansiveness of the Horton era, he prefers to use words such as discipline, teamwork - and even boring - to describe his style. Two weeks ago, BP announced a top-level reshuffle in which Mr Simon will become non-executive chairman, replacing Lord Ashburton who retires from the board. The new chief executive will be Mr John Browne, head of the company's exploration and production division who is credited with orchestrating a marked improvement in the division's results. The changeover marks a new phase in BP's recovery strategy in which the group will set itself more demanding performance targets, including higher earnings, more debt reduction and modest growth in capital spending. The targets are indications of BP's renewed self-confidence - 'the gateway to further disciplined growth', as Mr Simon describes it. These financial targets will be achieved through increases in oil and gas volumes, continued cost-cutting, and improvements in internal organisation to break down barriers between the company's divisions. The company is also committed to further changes in its corporate culture to enhance its competitiveness. This is driven by BP's belief that it will get little help from changes in the external business environment such as higher crude oil prices or wider refining margins, at least in the near future. The company assumes, for example, that oil prices are likely to remain in the Dollars 16-Dollars 18 a barrel range, around current levels. To be on the safe side, it uses a much lower figure, Dollars 14, when testing the economics of new oil fields. 'We have to build in performance under all market conditions,' says Mr Simon. BP also acknowledges that any technological lead it might have in certain areas, such as operating in the deep water west of the Shetland Islands or developing new fuel specifications, is likely to be short-lived in an industry where partnerships and the sharing of information is the rule. The company's competitiveness rests on its ability to get greater efficiencies from its operations. 'Anybody can copy a formulation or your technology,' says Mr Simon. 'But your competitors cannot ape your process.' One of biggest changes that both men want to see is closer co-operation between the exploration, refining and marketing sides of the business. BPX, the exploration unit, 'was in a world of its own five years ago,' says Mr Simon. Its focus was on a 'series of massive projects consuming huge amounts of capital,' with no direct linkage to market concerns. 'Now they are fully integrated into BP.' But the aim is to push the integration even further, especially in the fast-developing international markets in Asia and Latin America that BP is keen to enter. Mr Simon says 'the old mind-set among the explorers was to find the oil and build a pipeline'. But the new emphasis in selected countries will be on whether BP can 'feed in other businesses behind the upstream operation'. Mr Browne says such a strategy also fits in with changes in the way developing countries view international oil companies. 'Governments don't look to us just to drill holes but to help them grow their economies. Now we ask ourselves whether BP can become a part of the countries in which it operates.' One of Mr Browne's main tasks will be to oversee the diversification of BP's production base away from its current US/UK bias. BP's production is overwhelmingly based on giant fields such as Prudhoe Bay in Alaska and Forties in the UK's North Sea. Its most publicised recent forays have been in politically risky areas such as Azerbaijan, Colombia and Vietnam. Mr Browne, however, rejects the argument that growing involvement in such countries will increase the risk of supply disruptions: any shift away from politically stable countries will be 'very slow', he stresses. There is considerable scope for BP to 'strengthen and deepen' its involvement in existing areas, he says. 'Ten years from now, two-thirds of our production will still come from existing members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.' BP is also keen to build up its production in the fast-growing natural gas market, a business in which the company has lagged behind many competitors. The company has experimented with gas trading in the US and become involved in the emerging spot market for liquefied natural gas by shipping LNG from Australia to Spain. Mr Browne says the company is also thinking about entering the gas-fuelled power generation business in developing countries, although any move would be in co-operation with a partner experienced in the sector. Existing partnerships include a long-standing exploration venture with Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. BP's fastest-growing exploration partnership is with Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group. The selection of partners is a priority for Mr Browne, who says the company spends as much time assessing future partners as it does selecting senior executives. 'We keep an eye on the list of competitors to make sure the balance is right,' he says. Acquisitions of assets will continue under Mr Browne's leadership, but there are unlikely to be big structural changes to the company. The divestment of non-oil and gas assets is virtually completed, and he is content that the portfolio of potential oil and gas fields contains a good mix of opportunities. As for investments in other oil companies, Mr Browne has ruled out the possibility that BP will cement its preferred partnerships by taking equity stakes. 'We're not interested in collecting investments,' he says. 'We would rather do the business directly.' Creating a harmonious relationship between Mr Simon and Mr Browne will be vital in making a success of BP's growth strategy. The two men's experience appears to be complementary: Mr Simon's strength is in marketing, while Mr Browne made his reputation as first BP's treasurer and then the widely-respected head of exploration and production. Those familiar with the company say they also complement each other on a more subtle level. Mr Browne has a reputation for experimentation, a tendency that can create breakthroughs in such a technologically-driven business. It can, however, create tensions among more traditional executives in an organisation that is still in the midst of a bruising restructuring. Analysts say Mr Simon represents that more traditional BP culture, which may reassure those who have to be persuaded of the need for change. He is also the one person at BP whom Mr Browne defers to. While Mr Simon will be a part-time, non-executive chairman, he concedes he is unlikely to give up a lifetime habit of 'thinking about BP seven days a week'. That is likely to suit the other BP board members, who are reluctant after the Horton years to put all the responsibility in the hands of one man. There should, in any case, be plenty of work for both men. BP may be restored to health, but it will require continuing efforts for the company to succeed in a business where the global competition is unremitting.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

Pakistan had received 'an overwhelming response' to its efforts to attract foreign investment in power generation, receiving applications for four times the country's needs, she told a meeting of businessmen at the Confederation of British Industry. Now it needed investment in power transmission, oil pipelines and terminals and dedicated railway tracks as part of its effort to ensure that power shortages were not a constraint on growth. Ms Bhutto was at the CBI to sign agreements covering more than Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.56bn) of UK investments in Pakistan's energy, chemical and tourism sectors. Among these are a letter of intent from ICI to build a pure terephtalic acid plant costing Dollars 400m at Port Quasim. Other agreements signed by Lasmo, British Gas, Shell and Premier Consolidated Oilfields cover exploration and development of Pakistan's oil and gas fields. British Gas' initial investment with partners including Monument Oil and Gas will be Dollars 15m, but the figure could rise to Dollars 250m if its exploration in the Sulaiman mountain range of Baluchistan is successful. Businessmen say the rush of investment in Pakistan reflects its liberal approach, under which there is no limit on foreign ownership of any production facilities. All restrictions on repatriation of principal, interest, dividends and profits have been lifted and the domestic currency is fully convertible on current account. Although Pakistan has received a large number of investment commitments in power generation, some businessmen believe that fresh opportunities could arise if financing on existing deals falls through. Investment in power transmission could prove more difficult than in generation, not least because of the difficulty in ensuring supplies are paid for, they add. Pakistan is also seeking to privatise two existing power stations at Kot Addu and Jamshoro. National Power, which yesterday signed an agreement covering its Hub River power project, is bidding for these stations. Other companies involved in yesterday's signing were Midlands Electricity, Greyhound House, which is involved in tourism, and Biwater, which plans to build a Dollars 30m hydroelectric power station near Gilgit.

He says the state has the potential to rank alongside Western Australia, Chile and South Africa in the mining industry. This follows a ADollars 16m geological survey - one of the most comprehensive ever seen in the western world - carried out by the state government. The survey was needed because two-thirds of South Australia is covered by soil and sands which hide the mineral-bearing bedrock. However, advanced aeromagnetic surveys are able to penetrate this cover. 'The results are staggering,' says Mr Fardon. 'We've discovered bedrock terrains under shallow cover, which are equivalent to those containing the giant mineral deposits at Broken Hill, Mount Isa and Olympic Dam, all world-class deposits.' About 500,000 square kilometres, an area the size of Spain, are being mapped and tied in with other high-quality data and the details are being made available at very little cost to exploration companies. Mr Fardon is at present on a three-week tour of Europe and South Africa to spread the word. 'We would welcome foreign expertise and money.' So far about 30 per cent of the survey data has been released and applications for exploration licences have trebled in the first eight months of this year. The early data also sparked a diamond rush after aeromagnetic and radiometric pictures revealed about 60 geological 'bubbles' which closely resemble diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes. 'We could be sitting on diamond resources comparable to the world's biggest diamond mine at Argyle in Western Australia,' says Mr Fardon enthusiastically. About 10 companies have started a diamond search and are expected to spend about ADollars 2m this year. They include De Beers' local subsidiary Stockdale, CRA, Ashton Mining, and Poseidon. The department of mines believes that the region could contain deposits of gold, copper, lead, zinc, iron ore, nickel, chromium and tin in addition to diamonds. The main focus of interest is the Gawler Craton, a huge geological block that stretches over the Eyre Peninsula and north beyond Coober Pedy. Mr Fardon says: 'Foreign companies are welcome in their own right but we would prefer them to joint venture with an Australian company.

0,FT934-841 ,"FT934-841 _AN-DLVCCAE4FT 931222   FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch gas deal threatens 'horizon pollution' - Ronald van de Krol on plans for exploratory drilling in a much prized nature reserve      By RONALD VAN DE KROL   The Dutch are bracing themselves for a short bout of 'horizon pollution' in one of their best-loved nature reserves. Last week, under a deal worked out with three natural gas companies, the government cleared the way for exploratory drilling in the Wadden Sea, a much prized beauty spot that each year attracts millions of migratory birds  -as well as thousands of Dutch and German tourists. The prospect of drilling platforms has prompted environmental campaigners in this intensely flat country to decry what they see as 'horizon pollution', a uniquely Dutch preoccupation. However, they are far more concerned about the long-term dangers of seabed subsidence, the possibility of an oil and gas 'blow-out' and disruption to wildlife, both in the sea itself and on the Wadden (or West Frisian) Islands. In keeping with the environmental sensitivity of the area, the government has said that actual commercial exploitation of the gas fields beneath the sea must be done 'laterally' for at least the next five years. This means that any production platforms will have to be located elsewhere, probably on the Dutch mainland, the Wadden Islands or the North Sea, with drilling taking place at an oblique angle from some distance away rather than straight above the gas field, as would normally be the case. The drawback to lateral drilling is that it may be able to extract only about 70 per cent of the Wadden Sea gas. The rest will have to be considered unrecoverable, unless direct drilling in the sea is permitted after the year 2000. This month's agreement, which must be worked out in detail in early 1994, is a delicate and controversial compromise between economic and environmental considerations. It means that, although there will be no permanent drilling sites in the Wadden Sea over the next five years, there will be exploratory drilling at 21 sites over the period. Of these sites, about half will be in the sea itself, with the rest planned for the surrounding area. Exploratory drilling will be limited to the winter months, when the area is not visited by as many migratory birds, and to about three months per exploration site. The three energy companies - Elf Petroland, Mobil and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, a joint venture between Shell and Esso - are confident that they can produce gas from the Wadden Sea without running environmental risks. In 1984, the three companies, which hold long-term concessions in the area, agreed to a 10-year moratorium on exploration and drilling. The voluntary stand-still expires on January 10, and the new agreement will cover the next five years until 1999. What is still unclear, however, is whether the gas companies will be able to drill directly in the Wadden Sea once the latest agreement expires. The Wadden Sea's environmental significance means that little detailed work has been done until now on assessing its natural gas riches. The area clearly has potential to yield natural gas because it is sandwiched between the huge Slochteren gas field in the Dutch province of Groningen and the gas fields in the North Sea and the continental shelf. Rough estimates for the amount of gas located between the Wadden Sea range from 72bn to 221bn cubic metres, representing a monetary value of between Fl 14bn (Dollars 7.4bn) and Fl 44.2bn. Well over the half of the proceeds would flow into state coffers. If the Wadden Sea proved to contain 221bn cu m, this would be equivalent to nearly three full years of Dutch gas production at current rates of extraction. The government says that its cautious opening of the Wadden Sea to exploration is motivated not so much by financial gain as by the desire to bolster its 'small fields' strategy for the natural gas sector. This strategy aims to preserve, as far as possible, the Groningen field, which is still the largest gas field discovered so far in western Europe. Unlike most gas fields, Groningen can quickly raise or lower its output in response to seasonal or other types of fluctuation in demand, making Dutch gas sales more flexible than they would otherwise be. By giving priority to finding and exploiting smaller fields in places like the Wadden Sea, the Netherlands hopes to be able to use its Groningen gas to greater effect. 'Seen in this light, the potential gas reserves under the Wadden Sea are of great importance,' the ministers of economic affairs and of the environment said in a letter to parliament.

In a deal which saw the company sell its interests in the Ninian field to Sun Oil and Ranger Oil for Pounds 84m in cash and Sun's 20 per cent interest in the new Birch field, the management released the asset on which the company's fortunes were founded. The Ninian sale also marked the end of the disposal programme which followed its Dollars 1bn acquisition in 1992 of Ultramar, the event which analysts cite as being the start of the company's present troubles. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, yesterday said he was prepared for a negative reaction from some board members when he brought the sale before them. It was Ninian's discovery in 1974 which transformed a venture capital company, formed in the early 1970s to look for oil at the start of the North Sea's exploration phase, into a fully fledged oil company. It was the cash flow from Ninian which allowed the company to expand, mainly through acquisition. The board, however, thought the sale 'was exactly the right thing to do,' said Mr Darby. 'We got excellent value for a mature, high cost field.' The sale was the latest in a series of asset disposals the company has made recently to bolster a financial position that has been undermined by low oil prices. Late last year it sold a package of assets, including a 5 per cent stake in its main development project, the Liverpool Bay gas field, to PowerGen for Pounds 123m. However it has recently taken the Markham gas field off the market and Mr Darby said yesterday: 'The bulk of the disposal of assets are over. There may be some swaps . . . but I don't see any major asset disposals this year.' Analysts say the sale of Ninian symbolises Lasmo's strategy to shift its production away from high cost reserves. These have led to the company having a cost of sales per barrel of Pounds 8.15, compared with present sterling oil prices of about Pounds 9.30. Chevron, Ninian's operators, say there is scope for steady cost reductions in coming years and additional potential as technology enables companies to extract greater amounts of a reservoir. Lasmo is in a hurry, however, to implement its new low cost strategy, which it says should reduce its operating costs per barrel to Pounds 3.70 this year, compared with Pounds 4.10 last year and Pounds 5 in 1991.

In an official statement, House Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr.,  who is currently in Beijing in his official capacity as  president of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Inter-parliamentary Organization (AIPO), said Chinese  Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reaffirmed his  country's support for the adoption of a common economic  exploration and development program in the area.    Messrs. de Venecia and Qian agreed that a common economic  development program in the island group ""could include  fisheries, minerals, oil and gas exploration, maritime  arrangements, and weather forecasting.""    But Mr. Qian was noncommittal on Mr. de Venecia's remarks  regarding a four-year old proposed ""concomitant reduction of  forces (which) would be a prelude to eventual demilitarization  of the Spratlys."" However, Vice Chairman Wang Hanbin of  Beijing's National People's Congress (NPC) assured the AIPO  delegation that Chinese parliamentarians support proposals for  contending parties to temporarily shelve their claims to  sovereignty to the islands.    Current strategic assessments of forces stationed in the  islands have manifested continuing constructions of air and  naval support facilities, aimed at facilitating force buildup  during crisis situations.    The AIPO delegation had earlier held discussions with  President Jiang Zemin, NPC standing committee chairman and  former security chief Qiao Shi, as well as Foreign Relations  Committee Chairman Zhu Liang, during which Mr. Jiang had vaguely  assured the delegation that his government would ""play a  positive role, not a negative role"" in dealing with the  currently brewing crisis in the Korean peninsula.    Mr. Jiang had also issued the customary assurance that his  country ""will not be a threat to its neighbors in Asia or to  world peace,"" pointing out that increases in his country's  defense budget were caused merely by ""inflation adjustment.""

0,FT931-66 ,"FT931-66 _AN-DC4CXAGYFT 930331   FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Everything to play for in China's Tarim basin - Tony Walker explains why the oil majors are lining up despite past disappointments      By TONY WALKER   WHEN registrations close in Beijing today for what may prove to be one of the world's last great oil basins, dozens of international oil companies will have signed up for seismic data gleaned from sketchy surveys of China's remote far western region. Mr Liu Song Wei, President of the China National Petroleum Corporation International, said in an interview that the response from the oil industry to the opening of new onshore areas had been 'very encouraging'. Among oil majors that had shown strong interest, he said, were Shell, Amoco, Arco, Unico and BP, among several others. After years of hesitation, China is at last inviting bids to explore its Tarim basin, located in the Central Asian Xinjiang region; and while foreign companies are wary because of the region's inaccessibility - a Tarim basin pipeline would need to be longer than the Alaska one - they feel bound to pursue the opportunity. 'The question is not whether we can afford to be involved, but whether we can afford not to be involved,' said the Beijing representative of a large European oil company. Wariness among foreign oil companies in China is understandable, given the disappointments many suffered in their search for oil offshore. BP, for example, spent about UDollars 200m drilling dry well after dry well in the 1980s in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River Delta, and it was far from alone in its singular lack of success in Chinese waters. China's offshore areas had, incidentally been billed as one of the world's last great 'oil plays,' hence nervousness among oil explorers when similar hyperbole is used to describe prospects in the Tarim basin whose reserves, based on fairly flimsy evidence, are being likened to those of Saudi Arabia. When Dr Wang Tao, President of China National Petroleum Corporation, announced in February that China was opening 12 additional onshore areas in the north of the country to foreign exploration, including the prized Tarim basin, it marked a substantial and belated turnaround in policy, not only for China, but also for Dr Wang himself. Above all, the decision represented a painful admission that China, which is expected to become a net importer of oil by the mid 1990s, simply did not have the capital or expertise to develop a region of the Tarim basin's dimensions, remoteness and technical difficulty. The spiralling demand for energy generated by China's booming economy - economic growth neared 13 per cent last year - almost certainly spurred the change of heart. Mr Liu admitted as much when he said that 'since China's economy is growing so fast we need more energy resources, and if we don't make a big discovery maybe we will have to import. We need foreign investment to speed up activity.' The reality for China is that even if a foreign company strikes it rich immediately, oil would not be flowing from the Tarim basin into the country's pipeline grid much before the end of the century. The Chinese, therefore, are in for a painful few years coping with an oil shortfall. China's current output is about 2.8m b/d, and exports are running at about 400,000 b/d, down from a peak of 600,000 b/d in 1985. Oil production limped upwards by about 1.6 per cent last year, but only after substantial investment in recovery enhancement for the mature Daqing oilfield in the North East, which accounts for 40 per cent of China's oil, and whose reserves are rapidly diminishing. China's success in drawing foreign explorers into the search for onshore oil has been patchy. Since, 1985 when the foreigners were first given access to 11 southern provinces - foreign companies regard these areas as marginal - from Jiangsu in the north to Hainan island in the south, some five exploration agreements were concluded, none of which have yielded a commercial find. Mr Liu said delays in opening the Tarim basin were explained by the time needed by the Chinese side to conduct preliminary surveys and to prepare basic infrastructure such as airports and trunk roads to enable foreign companies to gain access to the region. 'You have to remember,' he said, 'that China itself did not start exploring in the Tarim basin until 1978.' The Chinese official was cautious about prospects in the Tarim basin, but he noted that preliminary studies indicated that reserves might be 'very promising'. China itself did not have a firm estimate of possible recoverable reserves, but he said that a figure of about 10bn tonnes did not seem unreasonable, based on initial studies. China, Mr Liu noted, had found oil near the five blocks covering 72,730 square kilometres being offered for exploration in the southern Tarim basin. It produced about 100,000 tonnes from these small-scale efforts last year. He revealed that design work had begun on a pipeline to carry the oil some 3,700 kilometres from the Tarim basin to Luoyang in central Henan province where it would enter the country's national grid to be pumped to coastal loading terminals such as Qingdao, or to be used domestically. Mr Liu estimated that it would take 3-5 years for the pipeline to be built, but speed of construction would depend on the 'size of the reservoirs' discovered by foreign explorers. CNPC, would participate in the financing of the pipeline, but would also be looking to foreign companies for contributions. In recognition of the costs associated with exploring in such an inhospitable region and moving oil thousands of kilometres from China's vast hinterland, the authorities were reviewing financial conditions. China was 'prepared to do more to improve the investment environment for foreign oil companies' in difficult locales such as the Tarim basin, Mr Liu said. Later this year, State Council or cabinet would probably approve separate regulations from those applying to offshore exploration later this year. This might involve an extension of the exploration period, and greater flexibility in the formula used to calculate both the cost recovery component of oil sold and also profit share.

Mr Asiodu, one of the leading technocrats on the transitional council, is the secretary for petroleum resources, and is highly regarded in the oil business. He has been associated with the industry for three decades, and has begun to tackle problems which, in the words of one oil man, 'have been holding back the industry for years'. Mr Asiodu and his colleagues are scheduled to hold office only until August, but he has nevertheless set an ambitious agenda. By then he aims to sign up foreign oil companies to develop new fields, get the multi-billion liquefied natural gas project off the ground after three decades of false starts, introduce sustainable domestic fuel prices, and free up the downstream and distribution sectors to foreign and private sector investment. If he achieves most of these aims, or commits the succeeding government to achieving them, 1993 will have been a turning point for the oil industry. Nigeria's budgeted oil revenue this year is Dollars 6.3bn, which is 80 per cent of the country's foreign currency earnings; but it sells fewer barrels of oil than it did in 1980, when the price was more than 50 per cent higher. Nigeria is even richer in gas than in oil, yet this resource has yet to be adequately tapped. The reasons include: inappropriate state regulation to limits on the percentage that foreign investors can hold in oil companies; downstream investment obstacles, such as loss-making domestic petroleum prices; and an inefficient local distribution system. One of these factors - the structure of the ownership of the oil industry - is putting a strain on the funding of production and exploration. Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) holds a majority stake in all the joint ventures that produce oil (which in March was just under 1.8m b/d. Yet NNPC - whose contribution to production and exploration should be proportionate to its equity stake - has said it intends to increase productive capacity from the present level of 2m b/d to 2.5m b/d by the mid-1990s, so that it can increase its Opec quota, assuming the market picks up. Nigeria's proven oil reserves are approximately 20bn barrels, but the majority of the oil fields are small and have wells producing between 500 and 5,000 b/d. Around two-thirds of Nigeria's production is onshore, mostly in the swamps of the Niger Delta, and all offshore fields are in shallow water. The next major area for exploration is in deep water concessions, as much as 4,000 feet deep. 'That is frontier territory,' says Jim Massey, Mobil's exploration and production director in Nigeria. 'Not much of the world's oil production is even at 2,000 feet deep. 'Under the production-sharing agreement, we would be purely a contractor with no equity. When we found oil we would recover our costs and then split the profits with NNPC on a sliding scale.' Mobil, like the other oil majors, stresses the importance of the Memorandum of Understanding, which in 1986 underwrote profitability for NNPC's equity partners at Dollars 2 a barrel, at a time when oil prices were very low. The agreement was amended to allow Dollars 2.5 a barrel, subject to sufficient investment, but provides no scope for extra reward based on high efficiency when the oil price is more buoyant. The draft production-sharing contract does provide such incentives, but forces the international oil companies to bear all the risk. Ashland of the US already has such a contract, but since 1991 a number of big oil companies have been negotiating for rewards to justify the cost of working in deep water. Among those interested in deep-water blocks is BP, in partnership with Statoil, ending an 11-year absence following nationalisation of its assets. Questioned about production sharing, Mr Asiodu replied: 'Once you have reached a taxation regime of over 80 per cent, the theoretical ownership of 60 per cent of the equity, as opposed to having a contractor working for you, brings minimal extra benefit', he said prior to issuing a third draft of the terms. 'So exploration sharing is better for us because we can save what little money we have for more pressing needs.' Among pressing needs is the improvement of efficiency in the downstream sector. Although NNPC has four domestic refineries with an installed capacity of over 400,000 b/d, one has been out of action since it caught fire in 1989, and the sector is running at about 50 per cent of capacity. Mismanagement and lack of funding due to very low domestic fuel prices have led to a crumbling distribution system and petrol shortages. Corruption and smuggling into neighbouring Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, where domestic fuel prices are about ten and 20 times higher, has exacerbated the problem. The Transitional Council believes the solution lies in lifting the fuel price subsidies. On March 15, it reduced subsidies on non-conventionals - that is base oils, lubricant oils, paraffin wax and aviation fuel. These measures, and a three-month campaign explaining to the public the arguments against the fuel price subsidy, are in preparation for the raising of the price of petrol and diesel, with the inevitable inflationary effect and the threat of riots in response. Privatisation of downstream assets is unlikely to bring the same enthusiasm from the big oil companies as the sale of NNPC's upstream equity, but if fuel prices are raised substantially, the way could be open for new investment to transform the marketing and distribution of petroleum products. Publication of guidelines and incentives for investment in gas-related and petrochemicals products is imminent. The government is forced to meet the rising cost of the Eleme petrochemicals plant, which plans to start exporting polyethylene and polypropylene early in 1994. At the same time, it has to fund Nafcon 2, the next fertiliser plant, the LNG project, and the gas-gathering venture with Chevron to produce Liquefied Petroleum Gas at Escravos.

During this stage interplanetary stations are to study the sun  and reach Pluto, the outermost known major planet of the solar  system. Scientific delegations on space exploration of the  United States and Russia discussed this bold idea and a number  of other projects for cooperation in the exploration of the  universe. Their meeting ended on Saturday.    Under the programme a U.S. probe will carry a Russian  optical  module to the sun. A complicated trajectory of the flight has  been charted. With the use of a highly-reliable Russian carrier  ""Proton"" the probe will be put on a trajectory of a flight to  Jupiter. When the probe is near Jupiter, the gravitation field  of the huge planet will turn it, and it will be directed to the  sun. Close to the sun, the Russian module will be separated and  will collect information about the solar atmosphere and surface.    Another joint flight is planned for the beginning of the  21st  century. It will be the flight to Pluto and its satellite  Charon. The main planets of the solar system, except for Pluto  and Charon, have already been studied by Russian and American  interplanetary stations. So the planned flight is of vast  scientific interest. During the flight the Russian probe will be  separated from the apparatus and will reach either Pluto or its  satellite. Experts believe much promise is offered by the idea  of using a U.S.-made small-size apparatus with new instruments  and a large-capacity Russian booster-rocket and a Russian-made  descendable probe meant for measurements in the atmosphere and  surface photography. Aside from other advantages, this  cooperation will make it possible to reach the remotest planet  of the solar system in less than ten years.    Exploration of Mars is planned to be continued. Two  spacecraft carrying Russian and American scientific equipment  are planned to be launched to Mars in 1998 and 2001.    Plans for cooperation in astronomy and astrophysics were  also  considered. Experts believe that spectro-roentgen-gamma project  will make it possible to create an orbital observatory to try  unravel space mysteries such as black holes, neutron stars,  pulsars, novas and supernovas and to study the universe. There  is also an interesting project for an orbital radio observatory,  Radioastron.    The final document of the meeting was signed by Wesley  Huntress, a chief of NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, and Yuriy Milov, deputy general director of the  Russian Space Agency.

Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, described the contracts as 'a landmark in the history of private sector investment' in Pakistan. The bulk of the new contracts involve power generation projects backed by US businesses, including AES Corporation, Enron, GE Capital and Tenaska. Occidental and Union Texas are involved in oil exploration contracts worth Dollars 275m and many officials hope that new oil finds will help the country's power generation efforts by providing lower cost fuel. Domestic businesses have suffered production losses due to disrupted power supplies. The rains that followed a long dry spell restored the country's hydro-generation capacity and narrowed the gap between demand and supply. However, the relief may be only temporary. Many transmission lines are in a state of disrepair and the government estimates that up to 33 per cent of the power generated in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, is lost in breakdowns, leakages and power thefts. In the rest of the country, up to 23 per cent of generated power is lost in similar ways. An energy policy announced this summer has set the tone for fresh investments. The government has eliminated much red tape by replacing a series of official procedures with a one window set-up in Islamabad. Moreover, investors have been assured of a bulk tariff rate of 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour, considered to be one of the more attractive rates among developing countries. The government's private power board estimates that up to Dollars 5bn worth of investments could come in power generation, in addition to the American commitments, during the next three years. However, for some investors, the signing of the deals may just be the beginning of a difficult process involving financing. The financial package requires them to put up a 20-30 per cent equity, while raising the rest in loans or other financing. Senior Pakistani officials concede privately that some of the sponsors may not be able to put together their financial packages, especially as international demands for financing remain high. Concerns have also been raised over the delay on Pakistan's plans to float its first sovereign Eurobond offer worth Dollars 200m. It was originally scheduled to take place this month but was postponed due to recent turbulence on international bond markets. Pakistani officials hope that the US commitments have opened the most important window to attract fresh investments, and that other foreign investors may follow.   Companies:-  AES Corp.

0,FT911-2029 ,"FT911-2029 _AN-BEBBRABIFT 910502   FT  02 MAY 91 / Shell in big Gulf of Mexico find      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   SHELL OIL, the US arm of the multinational Royal Dutch/Shell group, announced an important oil discovery yesterday in the Gulf of Mexico which could contain as much as 1bn barrels of oil. The discovery is the biggest made in the US for 20 years, opening up the potential of the Gulf region which the industry believes could become another North Sea. The Mars discovery is at a depth of 3,100 feet which will make it one of the deepest commercially-viable oilfields in the world if the decision is taken to develop it. The only other field of this depth under development is Shell's Auger operation nearby. Shell said that further engineering studies are required before it can estimate the full size of the find, but industry observers believe it to rank among the world's 'giant' finds which contain 1bn barrels of oil or more. The largest oilfield in the UK's sector of the North Sea is the Forties field which is estimated to contain 2.5bn barrels. Oil could come into production at Shell's Mars discovery within five years of starting development, the company said yesterday. British Petroleum has a one-third interest in the Mars field and the company said it was 'potentially the biggest prospect in which the company has participated since the discovery of its major North Sea fields'. Mr John Browne, head of exploration at BP, said the find 'obviously has great significance for the industry because it is the first time an operator has announced a discovery at these depths'. The depth of the water in the Gulf of Mexico - North Sea fields are 600 to 700 feet deep - makes it a more complicated and expensive discovery to develop, requiring the latest oilfield technology. One industry expert estimates that costs could be double those of the North Sea where it costs about Dollars 3.40 to produce a barrel of oil. But tax rates on oil revenue in the US are much lower than those in the UK and the discoveries will be more profitable. The development of deep-sea technology to exploit these oil finds has implications for the so-called 'frontier' area of the North Sea, west of Shetland, where exploration could begin in several years time.

The staking rush at Lac de Gras, 200 miles north of Yellowknife, the NWT capital, now covers 13m acres and has reached Echo Bays' Lupin gold mine and its 17,000-acre mining lease. More test results are expected shortly from a 160-tonne bulk sample extracted from the Dia Met/BHP-Utah property. On May 21 the joint venture of Canada's Dia Met Minerals and Australia's BHP group reported indications of 90 carats of diamonds with 25 per cent potentially of gem quality. Echo Bay held exploration leases just east of the discovery, said Mr Richard Kraus, the company's president, after the annual meeting in Montreal. Also the winter road connecting Yellowknife and the Lupin mine crossed Lac de Gras near the discovery. He said diamond exploration was very expensive and if Echo Bay wanted to explore its claims further 'it would be done with partners'. 'We are helping other companies in the logistics of diamond exploration. I can't say more because we are in registration with a USDollars 100m convertible preferred issue.' Echo Bay's four mines, including Lupin, produced 734,000 troy ounces of gold and 5.6m ounces of silver last year. In the first quarter, it posted a small loss because of low bullion prices but the company said it expected a gradual recovery in the gold price to Dollars 360 to Dollars 375 an ounce by the end of the year. This, together with the new stock issue, would bolster cash flow and enable debt to be reduced from the present Dollars 257m. Mr Kraus said Russian sales had peaked and Asian prosperity was creating excellent fundamentals for gold. Far East fabricated demand, mostly for jewellery, was now three times North America's and world mine output was not growing. Echo Bay has cut manpower by 15 per cent to 1,934 without affecting output. The Lupin mill's capacity will rise 15 per cent to 2,300 tonnes a day next year. Other improvements are coming at the Nevada mines and another mine in Washington State. Two Alaskan properties are ready to move ahead when gold prices improve. Exploration is focussed on the Northwest Territories, British Columbia, Alaska, Washington State, Nevada and the western Rockies. In addition a senior executive is examining possibilities in the former Soviet Union.  The Financial Times   London Page 32  "

This was sharply ahead of the previous year's Pounds 16m, struck after a Pounds 16m loss on the Panocean disposal and a charge of Pounds 8.4m for the management restructuring. The latest figure represents a 9 per cent rise on 1992's underlying profits of Pounds 40.4m. Group turnover rose from Pounds 875m to Pounds 964m, including Pounds 10.7m from discontinued operations. Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the management changes had contributed about Pounds 5m to profits, and movements in the exchange rate a further Pounds 4m. He described the markets for most of the group's services as tough. 'In these conditions the growth in our results was encouraging,' he said. Operating profits from the freight and distribution division, which operates on fine margins, eased from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 14.7m on turnover ahead from Pounds 644m to Pounds 748m. The profits fall was mainly due to Hull Blyth, which was seriously affected by the war in Angola. Profits at MSAS, the air freight brokerage company, were 15 per cent ahead on exchange gains and the benefits of a new computer system. Large new clients included Eastman Kodak. The marine services division, which contributes the bulk of profits, also benefited from exchange rates which countered lower oil prices. They rose by 25 per cent from Pounds 24.1m to Pounds 30.1m on turnover of Pounds 132m (Pounds 122m). The group succeeded in moving its oil exploration vessels away from the depressed North Sea to areas of strength in west Africa and south-east Asia. Profits from environmental services rose from Pounds 4m to Pounds 4.4m on turnover of Pounds 70.5m (Pounds 65.6m). The UK domestic waste business had a good year. Earnings per share were up to 20.3p (1.4p). An unchanged final dividend of 9.62p is proposed giving an unchanged total for the year of 14.33p. COMMENT Ocean has been running hard to stand still. The benefits from the restructuring and exchange rate movements have saved it from a flat year or worse. Most of the profits come from the marine services area, where low prices are curbing oil exploration budgets. Overall there appears to be nothing to get excited about from the rather mixed bag of activities. However, there is a further Pounds 3m benefit to come from the restructuring, and the balance sheet is strong, with gearing down from 35 per cent to 17 per cent.

This  direction justified itself with the discovery in the 10th  Five-Year Plan of very large gas and oil fields, which made it  possible to create a powerful base for the country's oil and gas  production. But the oil and gas condensates that emerged, unique  in their reserves, and the fields contain a substantial  concentration of aggressive components, which impeded their  processing, because of the unresolved aspects of many  technological and technical problems. It is enough to recall  that the USSR lagged behind the West for almost 20 years in the  level of development of production technologies.    All of this made it compelling to sign an agreement with the  Chevron Corporation. Difficult negotiations were conducted in  the course of several years, and a contract was signed as a  result within the framework of the USSR. According to the new  contract (1992), the period of validity was set at 40 years.  This transaction will be appropriate, although the contract has  not been subject to expert ecological examination as yet.    Analysis of the results of geological prospecting work in  the  12th Five-Year Plan showed that their effectiveness in the  Caspian gas and oil bearing province is one of the highest in  the former Union. The five-year task for increasing the reserves  of oil and condensate in the republic as a whole and in West  Kazakhstan was fully implemented owing to the exploration of  previously discovered productive sites (Karashagana, Zhanazhol,  Tengiz, and Korolevskoye).    Active prospecting in the subsalt deposits that was  undertaken in the last 15 years was not crowned with success, at  least at depths up to 5-5.5 kilometers in a number of areas that  were studied in detail from a geophysical standpoint and drilled  intensively, and with which a high promise of gas and oil  presence was associated. And this will create a tense situation  in increasing the raw materials base of the republic, although  today, as never before, there is a need for highly profitable  oil and gas fields that are accessible for quick and highly  efficient development.    The main reason for the difficult situation that has  developed, in my opinion, is the elimination in 1982 of the  Kazneftegazrazvedka administration, which was formed over the  decades and which explored very large oil and gas condensate  fields. Also having a negative influence is the disunity of the  geophysical service in West Kazakhstan and its inadequate  resolution capability in the preparation of deep drilling  structures.    The necessity for combining the geophysical organizations of  the former Nefteprom and the Ministry of Geology, which will  make it possible to reduce administrative expenditures, urgently  suggests itself. Moreover, the demarcation of territories of  West Kazakhstan between departmental organizations will be  removed, which will make it possible to concentrate prospecting  geophysical research in the most promising directions.    In the meantime, the scientific organizations of the branch  are not very concerned about the development of methods of  qualitative evaluations of fields in the early stages of  prospecting work. This leads to delays in the dates for  prospecting and exploration and also to an unjustified increase  in their costs. The oil and gas prospecting areas of Tortay,  Elemes, and others, where several dozen subsalt deep wells were  drilled almost without results serve as an example here.    As for the academic scientific organizations, in my opinion,  they are still engaged in unspecific research, such as: ""The  study of the sedimentary basin evolution to evaluate their oil  and gas bearing potential and determine the priority directions  in the development of the Republic of Kazakhstan fuel-energy  complex,"" or the ""compilation of a prediction map of gas and oil  in the Caspian Depression.""    The main task of the geological prospectors always remained  to shift predicted reserves to a proven reserve category; that  is, industrial. All efforts should be directed at exactly this.    There are no new discoveries, and the old ones have already  been sold at a loss, including Kenbay (Moldabek-Kotyrtas), the  largest super saline oil field, now named the Munay SP [joint  enterprise]. Its reserves were successfully protected by  KazNIGRI in 1990, and the field has been readied for  exploitation. Unfortunately, it remains to this day a subject of  discussion between Kh. Biderman, an American businessman, and  the administration of Kazakhstan's Atyrau Oblast.    The conservation of reserves, instead of their accelerated  involvement in processing, is at the least an impermissible  luxury, bordering on crime, for the economy of the state. It is  paradoxical that no one bears any kind of responsibility for  such mistakes. It would be proper, in accordance with the 5  April 1994 Kazakhstan presidential edict ""On Additional Measures  for Regulating the Use of Mineral Resources for Geological Study  and the Mining of Minerals,"" to accelerate the conduct of strict  order in the use of mineral resources.""    The situation is no better with the development of marginal  [zabalansovy] or suspended oil fields. For example, Zholdybay  and Akhmeshet were transferred with the approval of the oblast  administration to the Atyrau trading house. The latter, having a  vague idea about the oil business, is creating the Sanako firm,  which plans to invite Western partners as contractors, in order  to take their equipment and technology. Moreover, they want to  settle with them with money, and they are again taking credit  from the state.    It turns out to be more profitable in such cases to rely on  foreign investments than on credits and loans, inasmuch as they  ensure direct access to modern technologies, etc. The main thing  is that a heavy burden is not assumed by an already depleted  budget and, to the contrary, this promotes its increase. It is  not without reason that world practice recommends that investors  should be involved primarily for the development of already  explored fields.    Kazakhstan is blindly imitating Russia in many aspects,  forgetting that since 1992 it has been the law there that the  one who finds and produces oil is the one who trades in it. But  in our republic, as before, it does not serve the workers. As a  result of which the oblast that is the richest in an industrial  sense was transformed into an impoverished and backward kray. As  is known, 94.3 percent of the explored reserves of oil and gas  and more than 90 percent of the potential resources of  hydrocarbons are located in West Kazakhstan, and its  significance as the main region of the republic for producing  oil and gas will not change even in the long run, which should  be made the basis of the strategy for the development of the  fuel-energy complex. All of these arguments are intensified many  times over, if the unsold predicted resources on the land and  especially in the water area of the Caspian Sea are taken into  account. Kazakhstan unquestionably will become a second Kuwait  to the extent that the Caspian shelf is developed while  observing clean geological protection.    It should be added to what has been said that 149 of the 160  oil and gas fields, and five of the six oil and gas producing  associations, are situated in this kray, and the Yuzhkazneft PO  [Production Association] acquires its development through the  organization of the Caspian oil and gas-bearing complex. This  connection must be maintained permanently.    The total of the aforementioned facts dictates the need for  moving the headquarters of the Kazakhstanmunaygaz to West  Kazakhstan. With time it will be necessary to examine the  question concerning the location of the Kazakhstankaspiy shelf.  It must be assumed that the industrial development of the  continental shelf will start in the northeast of the Caspian,  and not on the ""Trans-Il Alatau shelves.""    The degree of exploration of resources in Kazakhstan is  relatively low. This means that a significant and stable  increase in oil production in the republic depends not only on  the development of known fields, but also on the results of  prospecting-exploratory work. Their level in recent years is  sharply lowered, while, given the existing geological potential,  it should grow steadily.    There is an extremely difficult situation in the geological  industry today. At the present time, geological exploratory work  has been stopped in many organizations. For example, in the  former Atyrauneftegazgeologiya PGO [expansion not identified],  now the Akbota holding company, 65 percent of the oil and gas  exploration enterprises this year are functioning thanks to the  Kazakhstanturkmunay, and out of the remaining staff, a majority  has been cut, and the rest are on indefinite leave. In the  advanced North-Emba oil and gas exploration expedition, out of  10 drilling brigades, three remain today that maintain  themselves on state budgetary infusions of the Ministry of  Geology. Field geologists do not receive their wages for months.    Recently, after conversion to joint-stock companies, the  Embaneft PO became the Embamunaygaz Joint-Stock Company and the  Tengizneftegaz PO in Kulsary became the Tengizmunaygaz  Joint-Stock Company. The sum of their annual oil production  totals not more than 2.3 million tonnes, of which 823,000 tonnes  is the share of the latter. I think it would be advisable to  combine them into one under the aegis of the Embamunaygaz  Joint-Stock Company. The common process in oil and gas  production is artificially divided into indicators that are not  related to each other, which consist of: an increase in  reserves, preparation in linear kilometers, meters gone through  or drilled wells, tonnes of produced raw materials, kilometers  of laid pipelines, etc.     "

Valencia: ""A Spratly Solution""]    [Text] At long last a solution to the vexing dispute over  the Spratly Islands may be possible. Claimed in whole or in part  bv China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei,  the geopolitical issues at stake here extend far beyond mere  ownership of these scattered, fly-speck islands and any oil the  area may harbour. How these contested claims are resolved will  tell us much about the future economic and security arrangements  in post-Cold War Southeast Asia.    The surprise agreement between China Petroleum (Taiwan),  China National Offshore Oil (China) and Chevron (U.S.) to form a  joint venture for oil exploration in the East China and South  China Seas suggests a way out. Although the spectre of a  China-Taiwan ""united front"" on South China Sea issues is not  without its dangers, it may make an agreement easier now that  the competition between them will be muted and other claimants  will no longer have to choose between China and Taiwan.    For with the U.S. role perceived to be diminishing, China's  longer term intentions are of particular concern. Partly in  response, Asean has begun to consider security cooperation;  Indonesia is attempting to assert some leadership in Southeast  Asia; and Vietnam, isolated and vulnerable, is attempting to  embrace Asean. All of these factors come together in the  Spratlys. A major sticking point today is that despite Beijing's  initial offer to put the sovereignty issue aside and to develop  the area jointly, it now appears to insist that other claimants  first recognise its sovereignty before joint development is  possible.    This complicates a solution, but it does not make it  impossible. The key is first to settle the outstanding  grievances between Vietnam and China, which involve areas  outside the core Spratly area -- on land, in the Gulf of Tonkin  and at sea in the Vanguard Bank area, where China awarded a  concession to Crestone Oil of the U.S. Certainly Vietnam's  interests lie in coming to some kind of agreement. One way out  would be for China and Taiwan to set aside their ""historic""  claim to most of the South China Sea in exchange for a combined  share of 51 percent in a multilateral Spratly Development  Authority, which would administer the core area and manage the  exploration and exploitation of resources there. If Vietnam  received a favourable settlement in the Tonkin Gulf and Vanguard  Bank areas, it might consider settling for less shares in the  Spratly area. Since Brunei claims only a tiny portion of the  core area, its share would be very small. The remaining shares  would be allocated among Vietnam, the Philippines and Malavsia.  Although China and Taiwan might argue that their 51 percent  share in the Spratly Development Authority constitutes tacit  recognition by the other claimants of the validity of China's  sovereignty claims, the other could rightly counter that, far  from relinquishing their claims, all they did was agree to  shelve them.    Indeed, under this cooperative regime the area would be  demilitarised, sovereignty claims would be frozen and the  Authority would resolve user conflicts, facilitate exploration  and development of resources, manage fisheries and maintain  environmental quality. The legitimate transit of vessels would  be allowed. The authority might also promote international  cooperation in scientific research and in protecting vulnerable  ecosystems.    Since the core area would be removed from contention, and  China and Taiwan would have set aside their historic line claim,  the relevant countries could then focus their efforts on those  areas outside the core area claimed by only two or three  governments, e.g., the southwestern margin claimed by Indonesia  and Vietnam; the southern margin claimed by Brunei and Malaysia;  and the northern portion claimed by China, Taiwan, Vietnam and  the Philippines. Eventually, sovereignty over the islands and  rocks themselves might either pass to the occupants or be  allocated among the different countries on an equitable basis.  Either way, the involved countries would be entitled only to  narrow territorial seas, could not use their respective areas  for military purposes and would have to grant access for  scientific research and -- more important -- any resources the  areas might harbour.    Certainly this solution is not perfect. It is complicated,  and the claimants would doubtless have various objections. But  it deserves some consideration, especially given the general  recognition that conflict would have far-reaching negative  implications for regional and great-power relations. Indeed,  already the governments involved continue to talk both  informally (the Indonesia-sponsored meetings), bilaterally  (China and Vietnam) and regionally (e.g., the Manila Asean  Post-Ministerial Conference and probably in the Asean Regional  Forum). In principle they all have agreed to a peaceful  settlement. There is, moreover, wide support for the concept of  joint development. Malaysia and. the Philippines, for example,  have agreed to cooperate in fisheries in their area of overlap.    But the window of opportunity may be closing. Unless these  nations move quickly, they may find that they have lost not just  a solution to the Spratlys but the opportunity to take an  important step towards a collective security arrangement that  could guarantee the peace and development of the region well  into the future.

About 300 workers will be transferred over the next year to Aberdeen, where the majority of BP's 5,000 Scottish employees are based and which will become an integrated headquarters for exploration and production across Europe. A further 350 people will be made redundant. Mr John Browne, the chief executive, said that the move was prompted by the need to cut costs, and the shift towards smaller and less economic fields in the North Sea. BP Exploration is the largest operator in the UK sector of the North Sea with an output of nearly half a million barrels of oil a day. Mr Fergus MacLeod, industry analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh, said the action was expected, and was likely to save BP about Pounds 50m a year. The St Vincent Street offices in Glasgow passed to BP when the company acquired Britoil in a Pounds 2.5bn takeover in 1988. Sir Peter Walters, then BP chairman, gave written assurances to Sir Peter Middleton, then permanent secretary at the Treasury, including that Glasgow would become the business headquarters of the combined BP/Britoil upstream business in the UK. The assurances were repeated in the Commons by Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said yesterday's announcement was a 'flagrant breach' of those guarantees. 'The guarantees were worthless and the deal sold on a false prospectus. This raises major issues of political honour and the way this government deals with multinationals.' He is to press for a meeting with ministers. Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, said BP were 'corporate liars'. The government initially retained a 'golden share' in Britoil, but redeemed that in 1990. Ministers said at the time that they were happy BP had fulfilled its pledges on Britoil. BP said Abbey National Life had agreed to lease two of the Glasgow building's six floors as a life assurance centre and was considering whether to take further space.

This is the first contract for foreign cooperation in  petroleum exploration and development in the Tarim Basin, and  the first contract reached through open bidding for petroleum  cooperation on the China mainland.    Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum and  Natural Gas Corporation, said the signing of the Tarim petroleum  contract by China, the U.S. and Japan not only represents the  new era for the input of foreign funds and technology into the  exploration and development of petroleum in Tarim, but it also  signals the arrival of a new era for the Chinese petroleum  industry and of fully opening up to the outside world.    State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, and Tomur Dawamat,  Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing  Committee, attended the signing ceremony. Before the ceremony,  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and Vice Chairman Tomur Dawamat met with  the three representatives who signed the contract.    The area of the southwestern Tarim Basin scheduled for  foreign cooperative development is located within the boundary  of Qiemo County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and  covers an area of 14,475.4 square kilometers. This February,  with the approval of the State Council, the southwestern part of  the Tarim Basin was designated a new area for expanding foreign  cooperation in petroleum development on the China mainland.  Public bidding began on 1 March, and 68 corporations from 17  countries responded with bids, some of whom made on-site  inspections of the subject area. By the end of October, the  various bidding organizations had delivered their bids and  planning documents to the China National Petroleum and Natural  Gas Corporation. After careful consideration the U.S.  corporation was the first organization invited for contract  negotiations, and an agreement was reached after numerous  discussions.    It is understood that the form of the contract signed on 20  December is consistent with the terms used in all Chinese  offshore and mainland cooperative endeavors. During the  eight-year prospecting period, the foreign parties will bear all  prospecting expenses and risks, and when oil and gas fields are  found, both parties will jointly fund development and  production, and will divide the crude oil produced in accordance  with the stipulations of the contract. China will observe the  international market price structure, and use U.S. dollars to  buy the oil apportioned to the foreign participants that is  taken from the Tarim area. This will dispel any misgivings the  foreign interests may have about shipping crude oil out of that  area.     "

Natural gas reserves rose from 136.7 billion to 137  billion cubic meters, an increase of only 0.2 percent.    By reaching the level of 3.8 billion barrels (a figure  representing what it will be possible to produce), Brazil is  guaranteed a petroleum supply for 16 years if no more is  discovered and if it continues to extract an average of 700,000  barrels per day, as it is doing today.    If that conservative scenario holds up, the figures are  quite  comfortable compared to those in other countries. Although  worldwide reserves (1 trillion barrels) are sufficient for 43  years, their distribution is less comfortable for some  countries. The United Kingdom has enough petroleum for 5.9  years' worth of consumption, and the United States has enough  for 9.8 years, according to Dimas Jose Simoes, deputy  superintendent of operations in the Petrobras Department of  Exploration.    The fact is that petroleum reserves are concentrated in a  small group of countries. Ninety percent of the world's  petroleum reserves are owned by only 12 countries (most of them  in the Middle East). Brazil, which possesses 0.4 percent of the  total, is in 20th place. And 54.1 percent of the world's natural  gas reserves, which total 138 trillion cubic meters, is in the  Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) and  Iran. In this case, Brazil occupies a modest 40th place.    Petrobras's plans for increasing Brazilian petroleum  reserves  call for investments on the order of $700 million annually in  1994 and 1995, according to Celso Lucchesi, the firm's  superintendent of exploration. Petrobras expects to add 350  million barrels per year through 1997.    In 1992, for example, when the proven reserves in 234  countries rose by 2 billion barrels, Brazil added 830 million,  or over half the worldwide volume [as published]. This was  achieved thanks mainly to Petrobras investments beginning in the  mid-1980's in the deep waters of the Campos Basin, where the  company discovered the giant Marlim, Albacora, and Barracuda  fields. In 1992, when worldwide investments in exploration  totaled $11.6 billion, Petrobras invested $680 million, the  equivalent of about 6 percent of that total.    Potential    According to Simoes, the 3.8 billion barrels of proven  reserves may increase to 8.8 billion. The difference between the  two figures (5 billion barrels) represents petroleum that has  been discovered but whose volume has not been verified, a  process that will require additional exploration investments  beyond those already made.    Petrobras also has a third figure reflecting ""petroleum  potential"": 18 billion barrels of oil equivalent (including, in  this case, petroleum and natural gas).     "

The Baltic state holds a small cache of high-grade crude in its north-west corner. At present 16 fields are being explored, containing 25m tonnes of crude, of which 9m tonnes is recoverable. Total on-shore potential has been pegged at 137m tonnes, of which 40m tonnes is recoverable - not insignificant for a country barely bigger than Belgium, but a far cry from Russia's 152,000 wells and 327m-tonne annual output. Sea Search, a Dutch oil concern, and RWE-DEA, a subsidiary of the German group, are finalists in the competition for rights to a field near Klaipeda, the western Baltic port city, according to Lithuanian energy ministry officials. A contract should be awarded by the end of this month. The two companies had expressed interest along with Svenska Petroleum, Neste and Knight, a US company - which, the officials said, also made preliminary offers before pulling out. This contract will follow an April agreement between Svenska Petroleum and Lithuania's Gargzdai Enterprises to form a joint-venture to develop the north-western fields. Exploration of the Baltic off-shore fields awaits the resolution of political questions. With newly independent states still settling sea borders, Russia and Lithuania are bickering over rights to a field that lies in Lithuanian and the Kaliningrad region's waters. Mr Robertas Timosiunas, a Lithuanian deputy minister of energy, expects that the disputed area designated as D-6 , a tiny plot with some 7m tonnes of oil, will be divided between the two countries. Negotiations are continuing. The undisputed off-shore field holds an estimated 150m tonnes of crude, about a quarter of which is recoverable, and needs outside investment as the Lithuanians cannot afford exploration efforts. The state's refining business similarly lacks western money and know-how to stem the decline in supply and output since the collapse of the Soviet Union. After a 2 1/2 -year dispute with environmentalist, Lithuania plans to restructure the Mazeikiai refinery. A modern structure dependent on imports from former Soviet republics, Mazeikiai operates below its 12m tonnes-a-year capa-city. An Ecu450,000 (Dollars 525,000) grant from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will help restructuring efforts, plans for which are being drawn up by the UK consultancies NM Rothschild and Trichem. The eventual programme, which Lithuanian officials expect to cost at least Dollars 80m, will include a new hydrocarbons port on the Baltic near the Butinge area, a pipeline connecting it with Mazeikiai and renovations at the refinery itself.

Mr Ken Derr, Chevron's chairman, said that 500 of the 2,500 jobs being eliminated related to a decision to downsize the company's refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. The refinery represents about 20 per cent of Chevron's total petroleum refining capacity and its partial or full closure has been under review for some time. Mr Derr said the company would focus on reducing operating costs. He said low natural gas prices, poor refining margins, the recession and reduced demand for petroleum products had hampered Chevron's financial results. Mr Derr said a final decision on Port Arthur would be made later this year. Among the options is a complete shut down except for chemicals manufacturing  -this would cut about 1,600 jobs. At a minimum the refinery will cut capacity by a third to 200,000 barrels a day. The other 2,000 Chevron jobs will be eliminated by way of voluntary early retirement, organisational changes and asset sales. Mr Derr said that Dollars 185m of the Dollars 270m fourth-quarter after-tax charges would relate to the Port Arthur refinery. If the refinery is shut down Chevron would incur an additional Dollars 200m charge. Mr Derr announced plans to accelerate Chevron's programme to sell off more of its non-strategic US oil and gas fields. He said new US environmental regulations contained in the Clean Air Act would lead to costs of more than Dollars 2bn over the next five years at Chevron's eight US refineries. The Chevron chief said the company's 1992 capital and exploration budget would total Dollars 5.3bn, 6 per cent higher than last year. In the third quarter of 1991 Chevron's net profit fell by 22 per cent to Dollars 313m. Deliveries of petroleum products in the US - an important measure of demand  -declined by 2 per cent in 1991, according to the American Petroleum Institute (API). The industry association said that oil's share of domestic US energy consumption fell to less than 41 per cent in 1991, it lowest level in 40 years. Mr Edward Murphy, API's finance director, said the statistics gathered for last year indicate 'that the exploration and production sectors of the petroleum industry in the US have entered a period of accelerated decline, while there is accelerated growth overseas'.

Under the Chinese constitution, all mineral resources belong  to the State.    The fee will be levied on all 9,000 State and 250,000  collective mining enterprises as well as foreign-funded and  private mining operators.    Each mining business will have to pay an average of less  than  4 percent of its sales income from mineral products as a fee.    Such a ratio, far lower than royalties abroad, treat foreign  investors the same as domestic firms, according to Fu Mingke,  deputy head of Mineral Development Management Bureau.    The bulk of the levy will be channelled to geological  surveys  and exploration work that are now stymied by a severe lack of  investment, said a senior official with the Ministry of Geology  and Mineral Resources.    The remainder will flow into general State revenue.    About 2-3 billion yuan ($230-344 million) a year is expected  to be raised from the levy.    The State Council is reviewing detailed rules on the levy  presented by the ministry, said Fu.    ""The levy measures will come into force in the first half of  this year,"" Fu said. He did not give a specific date.    The levy is aimed to help develop the State's economic  resources.    The government's annual spending on geological surveys and  exploration work is about 8 billion yuan ($919 million), far  below what is needed to detect new mineral deposits and  guarantee stable mining production.    In China, about 95 per cent of the energy and 80 percent of  industrial raw materials come from non-renewable mineral  resources.    The rules favour those with a higher mining recovery rate.  They will be charged less to inspire more efficient and  rational mining development.    Presently, enterprises and individuals which exploit  minerals  only pay small part of their income in resource tax. Many  enterprises and individuals exploit mineral resources with  inefficient mining practices or methods which damage the  environment. This causes severe waste and loss of precious  resources.    ""The new measures are in line with the international norms,""  Fu said adding that almost all foreign countries charge mining  firms a royalty.    The ministry prepared a draft of the rules in 1987, but met  strong protest from mining firms allegedly unable to bear the  financial burden owing to low State prices or mineral products.    ""The time is ripe now. China's market economy has freed up  the price of most minerals, including oil, coal and iron,"" Fu  said.    Another consideration is that overseas investors involved in  Chinese mines -- once an area forbidden to them -- should be  charged with the fee.     "

Comibol further hopes to complete two additional joint venture deals before general elections are held in June. Comsur will invest Dollars 13m in Bolivar and anticipates an initial 30 year exploitation plan. Under the terms of the deal Comibol will take 50 per cent of future profits. Future investment in Bolivar will be Comsur's sole responsibility. Both parties have guaranteed the jobs of the mine's existing workforce of about 300 and new jobs may also be created. Local miners are said to be broadly in favour of the deal. However, the directorate of the main miners' union, the FSTMB, remains implacably opposed to joint ventures. Union spokesman Mr Victor Baldivieso said it would try to prevent this joint venture and condemned Bolivar workers in favour of the deal. Mr Jaime Urjel, Comsur's managing director, said the company hoped to take over Bolivar within 45 to 60 days. The mine would then become operational within 15 to 18 months. A new mill - which will be able to deal with 1,000 tonnes of lead/zinc and zinc/silver ore a day - is being built at the site. The plant may process tin in the future. Comibol executive director Mr Armando Guzman said that while the FSTMB union was clearly opposed to the deal, Bolivar workers themselves would carry the day. He said it was possible that RTZ, the UK-based group, which has close associations with Comsur, would be involved in future funding of Bolivar's operations. The International Finance Corporation will also be involved. This is the third joint venture contrast to be signed between Comibol and a private mining company since 1991. But operations in the first two remain blocked by union action. Mr Guzman said both these joint ventures would be activated by August this year. Two further joint venture tenders have been issued by Comibol. The first, for which invitations have yet to be sent, is an exploration venture for alluvial gold deposits in the Pando and Beni Regions. The second, for which invitations were sent out recently, is for the exploration of the Cerro Rico (Rich Hill) in Potosi. A recent study estimated that the hill contained Dollars 400m tonnes of silver ore. Mr Guzman estimates there are between 80m and lOOm tonnes of silver ore reserves. According to figures just released by the Medium Mines Association, Bolivian mining registered negative growth in 1992 of 4.9 per cent, compared with growth in 1991 of 2 per cent. Legal sales and exports of gold fell by 46 per cent. Antimony production was down 34 per cent, wolfram 15 per cent, cadmium 38 per cent, silver 14 per cent and tin 5 per cent.

The vote went about 60:40 against Mr Conroy, although around 90 per cent of the small shareholders backed the existing board. A new eight-man board under the control of the company's two major shareholders takes over. The shareholders, Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish mining and industrial group, and Dundee Bancorp, a financial offshoot of Canada's Corona International, have a combined holding of 43.35 per cent. The new board announced that it was to begin 'a detailed assessment of the company's operations immediately,' and that Mr Graham Mascall, managing director of Outokumpu, and Mr Paul Carroll, a director of Dundee, would be temporary joint chairmen until 'an independent Irish chairman' was appointed. Hostility to Mr Conroy first surfaced in 1990 when the companies' two nominee directors, one of whom was Mr Mascall, resigned over disagreements on ore marketing arrangements for the chief asset - the 6m ton zinc/lead orebody at Galmoy, 70 miles south-west of Dublin. Mr Conroy objected to an Outokumpu proposal giving it sole and exclusive marketing rights to the ore. The boardroom coup was precipitated though by Conroy's IPounds 7.7m share exchange acquisition last year of Atlantic Resources, an Irish oil/gas exploration company. The two main shareholders argued that this was overpriced, was diverting Conroy's attention from developing Galmoy, and were clearly angered by what they saw as Mr Conroy's effort to dilute their holding in the company. Mr Conroy has remained adamant, though, that the Atlantic deal 'was good value', creating total oil and gas assets which he estimated 'at between IPounds 9m and IPounds 10m'. The new board is likely to sell off Conroy's oil and gas assets and to focus efforts on Galmoy, which would dovetail better with Outokumpu's other zinc mining interests in Ireland. These are the Tara mine at Navan, western Europe's biggest zinc mine, and its 24 per cent stake in the 13.5m ton zinc/lead deposit at Lisheen, close to Galmoy. At the meeting, Mr Mascall said it would be the intention to bring Galmoy into production 'as soon as possible'. Mr Conroy said: 'I am fully supportive of that. That is what I have been trying to do'. Cost of developing Galmoy is put at some IPounds 65m, once planning permission is approved. When in production the mine should be one of the lowest cost producers in the world.  The Financial Times   London Page 16 Photograph Richard Conroy, Atlantic purchase was good value (Omitted).  "
0,FT942-12430 ,"FT942-12430 _AN-ED2DAAEMFT 940429   FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Industrial logic that's very compelling - How the Enterprise Oil chairman sees the future with the prospect of Lasmo in the pipeline      By DAVID LASCELLES   'This is a big boys' game', said Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil, yesterday. It is a message he will have to press home hard, judging by the generally sceptical reaction in the City to his Pounds 1.4bn bid for fellow independent oil company Lasmo. But there are several points to his game plan. As his opening remark suggests, Mr Hearne is looking for size and strength. In an environment where low oil prices are exposing the weaknesses in the oil industry, he believes that a company needs 'clout and credibility' if it is to succeed. The combination of Enterprise and Lasmo, two medium-sized exploration and production companies, will have 'critical mass' he says, as well as the financial and technical strength needed to operate on a world scale. The deal would virtually double Enterprise's reserves and production. But having said that, Mr Hearne is also keen to dismiss the idea that he is after size for its own sake. 'This is not megalomania. I feel very passionately about this,' he said. And though a successful bid would greatly enlarge Enterprise, it would still be small relative to the oil 'majors' - about one tenth the market capitalisation of Shell, for example. So there was no question of stifling Enterprise's flair but of creating more opportunities to put it to work. Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director, said: 'We aim to create further value, not just add the two companies together.' Although both companies are strong in the North Sea, their operations have relatively little overlap elsewhere, and cover all the continents. The financial match is also good, Mr Hearne says. Lasmo is strapped for cash whereas Enterprise has completed the bulk of its Pounds 1.3bn capital spending programme and is about to reap the benefits in swelling cash flow. By merging Enterprise's strong balance sheet with Lasmo's, he expects to end up with a gearing of 44 per cent. This is lower than Enterprise's existing gearing of 48 per cent because it will include the proceeds of Lasmo's current Pounds 219m rights issue. 'We have the cash and they have the exploration prospects,' he said. 'The industrial logic is very compelling'. Above all, Mr Hearne believes that Enterprise can make more of Lasmo's oil and gas assets than Lasmo itself, though he was unwilling to come up with any specific examples yesterday - or point fingers at particular members of Lasmo management, though he says it suffers from 'continuing weakness' despite a reshuffle at the top. However, some market sceptics point out that Enterprise's own recent record has not been that brilliant, despite its stronger market standing compared to Lasmo. Its earnings per share are down from late 1980 levels, and its exploration record has tailed off even though capital spending has gone up. In particular, the market is worried that Enterprise is about to make the same mistake as Lasmo when it paid Pounds 1bn for Ultramar in 1991 in a bid for expansion, only to plunge into loss. Mr Hearne points to several differences. One is that his bid will be paid for with shares rather than topped up with cash, leaving the balance sheet in good shape. 'It is our policy to fund big deals with paper,' he says. A second is that, unlike Ultramar, Lasmo is not in the hard-pressed refining business. Another is that Enterprise is not planning on a 'fire sale' of Lasmo assets to finance the deal, as was the case with Ultramar. And lastly, Mr Hearne believes that his offer has been pitched at a realistic level given the unexciting outlook for the oil price. 'It's wrong to suppose that if you invest, the oil price will bail you out.' Mr Hearne says 'I honestly do not know' when asked what might happen to the oil price. But he says the offer has been examined in the light of a whole range of assumptions from Pounds 9 to Pounds 12 a barrel.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          COMPANY PROFILES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                              Enterprise    Lasmo   Combined                              Oil  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Reserves (mboe)              881           747*    1628 Production ('000 boepd)      159           167      326 Acreage ('000 net sq km)      75            53      128 Countries of operation        18            12       26 Net assets (poundsm)         951          1058     2498** Net debt (poundsm)           459           794     1034** Gearing                       48            75       44  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *after disposals **does not add up due to accounting adjustments Pro forma balance sheet figures includes Lasmo rights issue proceeds (pounds219m) but exclude disposal proceeds.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Enterprise Oil and annual reports  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Enterprise Oil.

The company is also expected to increase standing charges which have not gone up since 1990. The move came after the company yesterday turned in a better than expected third-quarter performance as its corporate restructuring programme gathered pace. The third-quarter after-tax loss of Pounds 164m on an historical cost basis was well below the Pounds 180m-Pounds 240m range predicted by analysts. It was also well below last year's third-quarter loss of Pounds 225m. British Gas usually reports a loss in the third quarter, the period of lowest demand for natural gas in its main UK market. The price rises are likely to provoke some controversy after the government yesterday signalled the introduction of legislation to open up the household market to competition by 1998. British Gas has often warned that the removal of its monopoly of supply to 18m households could lead to higher prices for some customers. The new price package is expected to include a system of discounts for customers who pay by direct debit. These form the most profitable part of British Gas's domestic business. Mr Richard Giordano, British Gas's chairman, recently said he hoped to double the 3m users paying by direct debit. He said the massive corporate restructuring exercise to prepare the company for competition was ahead of schedule. About 7,000 jobs were eliminated in the first nine months this year, he said. A total of 25,000 jobs will be shed over the next few years. He said growing competition in those markets already liberalised and regulatory pressures continued to hamper earnings. But the results so far this year have benefited from colder weather and a drop in interest charges. Operating profits for the nine months were Pounds 897m (Pounds 845m) on turnover of Pounds 7.06bn (Pounds 7.08bn). UK gas supply profits rose to Pounds 594m (Pounds 515m). The sale earlier this year of Bow Valley, the Canadian oil and gas exploration and production company, helped cut the nine-month net interest charge by Pounds 70m to Pounds 197m. The disposal of Bow Valley contributed to the fall of turnover in the exploration and production division from Pounds 771m to Pounds 742m. But operating profits of Pounds 143m (Pounds 146m) were hit only slightly. Analysts said this reflected the relatively high cost of Bow Valley's production. The division's remaining assets in the division were lower cost and therefore more profitable. Attributable profits for the nine months were Pounds 466m (Pounds 409m). Earnings per share were 10.7p (9.5p). Lex, Page 22   Companies:-  British Gas.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4923 Gas Transmission and Distribution.

0," FR941021-0-00056   FR941021-0-00007        Information Submitted With the Archaeological Report           Comment:     One commenter suggested that a new 250.26(c) be added to require that the reports submitted to the Regional Director include all the data, artifacts, records, and remains obtained during the investigations conducted pursuant to 256.26 (a) and (b), pertaining to reporting requirements for the protection of possible or discovered archaeological resources.       Response:     The marine remote sensing survey data collected to evaluate archaeological resources is maintained by the lessee or right-of-way holder; however, the data must be made available to MMS upon request. The MMS maintains copies of the archaeological reports prepared from the remote sensing survey data. Because the archaeological surveys conducted prior to OCS activities are reconnaissance surveys, evidence of potential resources is used to avoid lessee activity that could harm or disturb artifacts or remains. Thus, artifacts or remains are rarely recovered or disturbed.       Archaeological Surveys and Grandfathered Leases           Comment:     One commenter suggested that MMS should continue its practice of requiring no archaeological surveys for grandfathered leases. (The commenter's view is that a grandfathered lease is any lease issued by MMS prior to December 1973, the date the first lease with an archaeological resource stipulation was issued). The commenter also indicated that existing survey data on older leases should continue to be acceptable to MMS for exploration and most development activities for as long as the lease remains in force. The commenter believes that although the aforementioned practices are not specifically addressed or confirmed in the proposed regulations, it is implicit in the provisions thereof that MMS does not intend for the proposed changes to the regulations to change these existing procedures. It is the commenter's position that to do otherwise would directly impair existing lease contract rights.       Response:     The MMS does not agree that any lease issued prior to the inclusion of an archaeological resource lease stipulation in December 1973 is grandfathered and exempt from the requirement to protect and preserve resources under either the existing or proposed regulations. The archaeological stipulations included in OCS leases in December 1973 were designed to ensure that lessees and other interested parties were aware of the need to protect and preserve archaeological resources. The absence of an archaeological stipulation in an OCS lease issued prior to December 1973 does not free the lessee of its obligation to protect and preserve resources. In accordance to 250.33(b)(15) or 250.34(b)(8)(v)(A), if the Regional Director notifies the lessee that an archaeological resource may exist in the lease area, prior to commencing any operations, the lessee is required to prepare a report as specified by the Regional Director to determine the potential existence of any archaeological resource that may be affected by operations. Thus, the regulations are applicable to any new exploration or development operations except preliminary activities (250.31). If there are no new activities, production operations will continue with no changes in the status quo.

Other commenters suggested that this clause, commonly called the ``chance finds clause,'' be changed to reflect the fact that not all discoveries made during operations will require protection.        "," FR941021-0-00056   FR941021-0-00007        Information Submitted With the Archaeological Report           Comment:     One commenter suggested that a new 250.26(c) be added to require that the reports submitted to the Regional Director include all the data, artifacts, records, and remains obtained during the investigations conducted pursuant to 256.26 (a) and (b), pertaining to reporting requirements for the protection of possible or discovered archaeological resources.       Response:     The marine remote sensing survey data collected to evaluate archaeological resources is maintained by the lessee or right-of-way holder; however, the data must be made available to MMS upon request. The MMS maintains copies of the archaeological reports prepared from the remote sensing survey data. Because the archaeological surveys conducted prior to OCS activities are reconnaissance surveys, evidence of potential resources is used to avoid lessee activity that could harm or disturb artifacts or remains. Thus, artifacts or remains are rarely recovered or disturbed.       Archaeological Surveys and Grandfathered Leases           Comment:     One commenter suggested that MMS should continue its practice of requiring no archaeological surveys for grandfathered leases. (The commenter's view is that a grandfathered lease is any lease issued by MMS prior to December 1973, the date the first lease with an archaeological resource stipulation was issued). The commenter also indicated that existing survey data on older leases should continue to be acceptable to MMS for exploration and most development activities for as long as the lease remains in force. The commenter believes that although the aforementioned practices are not specifically addressed or confirmed in the proposed regulations, it is implicit in the provisions thereof that MMS does not intend for the proposed changes to the regulations to change these existing procedures. It is the commenter's position that to do otherwise would directly impair existing lease contract rights.       Response:     The MMS does not agree that any lease issued prior to the inclusion of an archaeological resource lease stipulation in December 1973 is grandfathered and exempt from the requirement to protect and preserve resources under either the existing or proposed regulations. The archaeological stipulations included in OCS leases in December 1973 were designed to ensure that lessees and other interested parties were aware of the need to protect and preserve archaeological resources. The absence of an archaeological stipulation in an OCS lease issued prior to December 1973 does not free the lessee of its obligation to protect and preserve resources. In accordance to 250.33(b)(15) or 250.34(b)(8)(v)(A), if the Regional Director notifies the lessee that an archaeological resource may exist in the lease area, prior to commencing any operations, the lessee is required to prepare a report as specified by the Regional Director to determine the potential existence of any archaeological resource that may be affected by operations. Thus, the regulations are applicable to any new exploration or development operations except preliminary activities (250.31).

0,FT943-2308 ,"FT943-2308 _AN-EITEUAC6FT 940920   FT  20 SEP 94 / Technology: A new field of exploration - The oil industry could be revolutionised by a software standards project in Houston      By ROBERT CORZINE   The half-a-dozen Texas oil men and computer industry executives sitting round a boardroom table in Houston last week bore little resemblance to die-hard revolutionaries. Sipping soft drinks, their demeanour was more that of correct corporate citizens. But their rhetoric revealed a true believer's commitment to nothing less than the wholesale destruction of the current structure of the world oil industry. Their chosen weapon is a new set of software operating standards being developed by the Houston-based Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (Posc), a non-profit organisation set up in 1990 by British Petroleum, Chevron, Mobil and Texaco of the US and Elf Aquitaine of France, five of the world's biggest international oil companies. If implemented, the standards should ease the growing problem of data management and incompatible computer communication systems within one of the world's most technologically-intensive industries. And that could lead to early cost reductions in the 'upstream' exploration and production end of the oil and gas business. But the real power of the new standards is that they would enable companies to break down the barriers that have been built up over decades between the various technical and scientific disciplines involved in oil and gas exploration. Posc technology can be 'a destroyer of current organisations', according to Larry Gehagen, a BP executive seconded to the corporation. He believes that adoption of an industry-wide computing standard will be as important to oil companies as the adoption of a common gauge for track was to US railways in the last century. The result, he predicts, will be a radical restructuring of oil companies, with whole layers of bureaucracy being abolished. It could also usher in the era of the 'virtual oil company', in which small teams of specialists located around the world exchange complex geological and scientific data in near real time via information superhighways. That prospect, according to a Posc executive, caused one Alaskan oil man to note recently that: 'If this thing really works, one man and his dog could develop an oil field. And you might not even need the dog.' Several of the large computer groups and software suppliers such as IBM, Digital and Hewlett-Packard, are co-operating with the Posc project, along with government agencies such as the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK and the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. The need for a unified data and computer communication model for the exploration and production industry has long been recognised, according to Posc supporters. But attempts by companies, even the largest ones such as Exxon, to integrate the various technical functions failed because of the high costs involved. The scale of the problem has been exacerbated in recent years as exploration and production companies experienced an explosion of data from new seismic and other scientific techniques which have been developed. The current structure of most oil companies has also proved to be a problem. At present, most are divided into functional departments, such as geology, petrophysics and reservoir engineering, a structure which industry executives say tends to reinforce existing cultural differences between the groups. Traditionally, these departments have operated in relative isolation, and over the years they have tended to acquire unique solutions to their technical problems, both in terms of computer hardware and software. The result, according to Posc executives, is that information held by one department is often inaccessible by, or unknown to, another. In addition, the inability of the departments to share information without reformatting it to different standards has reinforced a linear corporate structure. And that has made it difficult to put in place the inter-disciplinary teams that many industry executives believe are the most effective way to organise the industry. Gehagen notes that the poor standard of data management within the industry can have expensive consequences. One company recently mobilised its resources for an urgent seismic survey in a portion of the Gulf of Mexico in advance of a US government auction of oil leases. At the last minute one member of staff remembered that some years before the company had not only conducted a seismic survey of the area, but had also drilled some inconclusive wells before handing it back to the government. 'Eighty per cent of data held by oil companies is historical and static,' according to Gehagen. Only 20 per cent is generally in current use, with an even smaller amount considered as secret, commercially strategic information. Even so, many companies jealously guard it, although a large number 'don't know what they have or can't find it' when they need it. All too often the result is that geologists and other professionals can spend up to 60-70 per cent of their time searching for information rather than using their skills to analyse it. One of Posc's main aims is to create standards that make consistent the way in which the industry stores information so that it can can be used more effectively. Handing over the management of such technical data to an outside company which could put it in a Posc-compatible format would save millions of dollars a year for most oil companies, says Gehagen. The development of such large-scale databases open to the industry would also free the various experts within the oil companies to spend the bulk of their time doing their job rather than tracking down data. The opportunity to transfer data easily between disciplines could also result in large cost savings. A recent pilot project in the US estimated that the time taken to drill a new well in an existing oil field could be halved if all disciplines were working to a common data model. 'Exploration and production companies continuously adopt new computing technology,' says Bill Bartz, Posc's president. 'If they proceed without the benefit of standards, they risk incurring unnecessary costs and experiencing critical delays in implementation.' It is that element of Posc technology that could propel oil companies into a radically different future. Most have launched extensive restructuring programmes to save costs in an era of relatively low oil prices. But they 'have slashed and burned without fundamental changes in their business structures,' says Gehagen. He believes that adoption of Posc standards would enable executives to make the best use of the team structure now being promoted by many companies. 'People around the world could be much more productive if they were working with the same underlying system.' The adoption of Posc would also have a big impact on information technology companies, which advise companies on how to implement such far-reaching changes, and on the software houses that supply the industry. The first software products designed to the new standards will begin appearing next year, although industry experts expect it could take three to five years to fully change over.

Net first-quarter earnings were Dollars 136m or 45 cents a share, up from Dollars 108m (37 cents a share) a year earlier. The latest figure, however, includes a Dollars 53m tax benefit from operating loss carryforwards created by last year's restructuring. These carryforwards, which totalled Dollars 1.7bn last December, can be set against taxes on operating income and capital gains. They are recorded as an extraordinary item. Mr Ray Irani, who took over as chairman when Dr Hammer died, has taken the scalpel to Occidental with the aim of concentrating on the core businesses of oil, gas and chemicals. He has put several of Dr Hammer's pet projects on the block, and laid off 1,000 employees. He signalled a break from the past by moving the annual meeting from Dr Hammer's birthday on May 20 to a date 10 days earlier. Oil and gas earnings in the first quarter rose 22 per cent to Dollars 122m, reflecting higher oil prices and production, higher international natural gas volumes and improved domestic gas liquids prices. On the other hand, earnings from chemicals dipped by 25 per cent to Dollars 139m, as a result, among other things, of higher feedstock prices and lower farm products volumes. Amoco Corp lifted its first-quarter earnings by 6 per cent to Dollars 803m or Dollars 1.60 a share from Dollars 466m, or 91 cents a share a year earlier, due largely to a benefit from a change in accounting for income taxes. Excluding this benefit, earnings of the Chicago-based energy producer rose 6 per cent to Dollars 492m. Refining and marketing income rose to Dollars 214m from Dollars 129m, due to wider refining margins. On the other hand, earnings from exploration and production fell steeply, both in the US and internationally. The drop was due to lower natural gas prices, a fall in domestic crude oil output and higher exploration expenses. Olin, the Connecticut-based chemicals and special metals producer, took an Dollars 80m charge in the first quarter as part of a restructuring. Other measures include a 10 per cent cut in the salaried workforce and the sale of several businesses. These include industrial phosphates, electronic chemical and inter-connect operations, and some small chemical and metal product lines. As a result Olin suffered a first-quarter loss of Dollars 59m (Dollars 2.20 a share), against earnings of Dollars 32m (Dollars 1.60 a share) a year earlier.

The announcement late last month that Canada was easing a 16-year aid embargo, imposed in protest at Cuba's involvement in the Angolan civil war, is expected to speed the growing involvement of Canadian non-governmental organisations and universities in Cuba. Two Canadian universities for instance, have set up English-language training courses for Cubans. Ottawa has never joined Washington in imposing trade sanctions against Cuba. Air Canada, for example, has maintained a regular service to Havana, and Canadians have been among the largest groups of foreign tourists visiting Cuba. Two-way trade totalled CDollars 311m (Dollars 224m) last year. The Canadian business presence in Cuba is centred on mining, oil and gas exploration and tourism. Joutel Resources of Toronto last year became the first western mining company to sign an exploration agreement with Geominera, the Cuban mining agency. Last month, Sherritt, a Canadian nickel and cobalt producer, unveiled plans for a joint venture with Compania General de Niquel which will include mining and ore processing facilities in Cuba, and a refinery in Alberta. In addition, Canadian hotel operators have signed management contracts with more than half a dozen Cuban hotels. Companies will also benefit by being able to draw on funds from the Canadian International Development Agency (Cida) for feasibility studies. Canadian investors and joint-venture partners have generally found a warm welcome in Cuba. Dr Jim Henderson, a member of the Ontario provincial legislature who has taken a close interest in Cuba, says that 'the wheels can turn very quickly, provided it's a kind of business that Cuba has decided it wants.' The recent shift in Ottawa's policy towards Cuba are unlikely to have a profound impact either on Cuba's tottering economy or its relations with the outside world. However, they highlight a clear division between the US and some of its allies on the best way of halting the deterioration in social and economic conditions in the country. The Clinton administration has continued to apply, though without great enthusiasm, the comprehensive embargo imposed 30 years ago. Calls from the US business community, especially hotel operators, to ease the curbs have been offset by pressure from the large Cuban community in the US to maintain them. Ottawa however, has come to the conclusion that continued isolation carries risks of its own. Its new policy is based on a view that industrial countries need to become more involved to alleviate the island's economic and social problems before they lead to an explosion. Ms Christine Stewart, a junior foreign affairs minister, told an Organisation of American States meeting in Brazil earlier this month that 'the isolation of Cuba is unhealthy, and it's within all of our interests to support change in Cuba that is positive and healthy.' The Clinton administration has taken an interest in the recent initiatives by Ottawa, but is said to have neither encouraged nor discouraged them.   Countries:-  CAZ  Canada.

0,FT932-12482 ,"FT932-12482 _AN-DD1B4AD8FT 930428   FT  28 APR 93 / Gas companies break their traditional mould: Rapid growth opportunities in the global energy market      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   BRITISH GAS engineers from Liverpool lay pipes to connect the sleepy town of Kelbra in the foothills of the Harz mountains to the east German gas grid using technology developed in the UK. Enron, the US gas transit company, unveils one of the world's largest gas-fired combined heat and power stations on Teesside in the UK at a total cost of Pounds 895m. Both projects are evidence of the growing trend among gas companies to break out of the traditional confines of their domestic markets and extend their global reach. 'We are moving into a new era of gas and you will see the growth of the gas majors in a similar way to the development of the oil industry in the 1950s,' said Mr Ken Lay, chairman of Enron. Mr Lay has ambitious plans for Enron to be one of the first truly global gas companies, but he faces intense competition from British Gas and other European energy companies such as Spain's Gas Natural and Belgium's Tractebel. But Mr Jonathan Stern, analyst at Gas Strategies, a consulting group, believes that since the gas business is so capital intensive, companies will be financially constrained from developing a worldwide network in the way the oil industry has done. 'It will become a regional business and is already becoming dominated by about 20 companies with strong local bases which are expanding into specific markets overseas,' he said. Gas Natural, for example, is looking to expand into overseas Spanish-speaking markets and focusing on opportunities created by the wave of privatisation in South America. Gas companies' global ambitions rest on the back of a growing trend towards de-regulation and privatisation in the world energy business, accompanied by expectations of huge growth in gas demand over the next 20 years. 'The worldwide gas market is expanding fast and it offers a unique opportunity for huge growth to some of the companies that are getting involved now,' said Mr Simon Blakey, gas analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Gas is becoming more attractive as an alternative to coal and oil because of its environmental advantages - it is much cleaner to burn - and its price is competitive. In a cautious estimate for the growth in global gas demand by 2010, Royal Dutch/Shell group puts consumption at 2,500bn cubic metres from the current level of 2,000bn cubic metres. The rapid growth in gas demand poses a huge challenge for the energy industry. In a recent speech, Mr Roland Williams, gas and coal co-ordinator for the Shell group, estimated that the cost of finding, producing and transporting new gas to the main markets over the next 20 years will be between Dollars 800bn (Pounds 519bn) and Dollars 1,100bn. The oil companies have so far stuck mainly to gas exploration and production, resisting involvement in distribution or power generation, which could prove the more lucrative market sectors. Gas is not a globally-traded commodity in the way oil is, and gas companies will have to develop the expertise to operate differently in different parts of the world. Gas distribution is an area where companies such as British Gas, which has rapidly developed its own domestic markets, can offer technology and know-how with the financial muscle to invest in developing transit networks. 'We have expertise in all parts of the gas chain and we want to grow in all directions, but our real knowledge is in developing gas markets,' said Mr Russell Herbert, director of British Gas's Global Gas business. This has seen British Gas tapping into potentially lucrative markets overseas. The company is active in 45 countries. But competition is intense  -European gas companies fear their market monopolies may be broken up by the EC and many are looking to diversify overseas. These new markets offer great growth potential, but bring with them a bigger risk of regulatory interference than exists in gas exploration and production. Countries privatising their utilities have often looked to the UK for a model and here, British Gas has suffered at the hands of the regulator. However, established gas companies such as British Gas, Gaz de France and Ruhrgas have great marketing expertise they can offer countries developing their gas businesses. Technology usually means they can offer cost savings in running a market and they also have the cash to invest in large scale projects. Gas distribution companies are also moving into oil exploration. British Gas is currently involved in negotiations to develop the giant Karachaganak field in Kazakhstan, which would double its existing gas reserves. Germany's two main gas companies, Ruhrgas and Wintershall, are looking to buy into exploration acreage in the North Sea. British Gas's need to expand is driven by more pressing concerns: its UK market is being actively eroded by regulators and government. The company is under investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which could lead to substantial changes in its UK business. The UK regulator has already warned the company that it will not be able to finance expansion overseas by raising prices in the UK. The next 10 years, however, should see the transformation of the gas business from the current domestically-focused supply chains into a much more global industry.   Companies:-  British Gas.

By RUDY ABRAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      President Bush suggested Friday that he has decided to ban for the foreseeable  future oil drilling and exploration off the coast of Florida near the  Everglades because of the environmental sensitivity of the area.    ""I know enough about the Everglades and have been briefed enough on the  environment of the Everglades to know that the ecological balance is highly  sensitive,"" he told the American Society of Newspaper Editors. He added that he  plans to announce an offshore drilling policy ""that prohibits drilling in  certain highly sensitive areas.""    The President's comments were the strongest hint of his plans concerning three  huge areas of the Outer Continental Shelf where he suspended preparations for  leasing in February, 1989.    In addition to the lease sale area southwest of the Everglades, the suspension  covered two areas of the Outer Continental Shelf along two-thirds of the  California coastline.    In January, an intergovernmental task force sent Bush a secret 200-page report  detailing the environmental and economic impacts of drilling in the three areas  and his options for offshore exploration and drilling. There still has been no  indication of when he intends to announce his decision.    Bush has said that a total ban on offshore drilling is not being considered,  but he and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., who was chairman of the task  force, have promised that drilling will not be permitted in areas that have  special ecological sensitivity.    From the beginning of the task force review, knowledgeable sources have  predicted that the area off the southern tip of Florida was the most likely of  the three to be given long-term protection, because of the sensitivity of the  Everglades as well as the already-threatened coral formations in the area.    As in California, Florida residents express strong sentiment against drilling  offshore, and Lujan several weeks ago suggested that the state of Florida might  wish to buy back 73 federal leases already granted off its shores. Discussions  on the issue are now under way between state and federal officials.    Bush made no mention of two California lease sales on which he suspended  activity pending his task force study. But Sen. Pete Wilson, whom the President  supports in the California gubernatorial campaign, has sided with  environmentalists in opposing drilling on federal property off the state's  coast.    Bush did reiterate his position that an outright ban on offshore drilling is  not feasible.    ""It has been proved in my part of the country that offshore drilling can be  done compatibly with the environment,"" he said.    ""My position is there shouldn't be a permanent ban on offshore drilling because  then I would be compelled to ask the question: 'Where do we get the energy to  keep this country going and to keep the working man and woman at work and heat  the homes?'

From the beginning of the task force review, knowledgeable sources have  predicted that the area off the southern tip of Florida was the most likely of  the three to be given long-term protection, because of the sensitivity of the  Everglades as well as the already-threatened coral formations in the area.    As in California, Florida residents express strong sentiment against drilling  offshore, and Lujan several weeks ago suggested that the state of Florida might  wish to buy back 73 federal leases already granted off its shores. Discussions  on the issue are now under way between state and federal officials.    Bush made no mention of two California lease sales on which he suspended  activity pending his task force study. But Sen. Pete Wilson, whom the President  supports in the California gubernatorial campaign, has sided with  environmentalists in opposing drilling on federal property off the state's  coast.    Bush did reiterate his position that an outright ban on offshore drilling is  not feasible.    ""It has been proved in my part of the country that offshore drilling can be  done compatibly with the environment,"" he said.    ""My position is there shouldn't be a permanent ban on offshore drilling because  then I would be compelled to ask the question: 'Where do we get the energy to  keep this country going and to keep the working man and woman at work and heat  the homes?'

As BP, Shell, Lasmo, Clyde, British Gas and other western oil groups yesterday completed staff evacuation from Sanaa in the north and Aden in the south, executives at many company headquarters said that, whatever the outcome of the fighting, there was a growing disillusionment about oil prospects in the country. A large number of foreign countries entered into exploration contracts with Yemen after its unification in 1990. Optimism peaked two years ago, when more than 20 companies rushed to conclude exploration deals. These were mostly in the south, after Canadian Occidental discovered viable fields in the Masila area, the north-west corner of former South Yemen. CanOxy says it is now pumping 150,000 barrels a day from the area, production which the company says will continue despite evacuation of its staff. CanOxy's find followed the discoveries in the mid-1980s by Hunt Oil, the Dallas-based group, in North Yemen. Yemen Hunt Oil produces most of the rest of Yemen's present output, about 320,000 b/d. It has also said production is continuing. Despite heady predictions from the government and some analysts that Yemen might eventually be capable of producing 1m or even 2m b/d, Yemen's rugged south has failed to deliver its apparent promise. 'There's been a very significant spate of drilling,' says the head of one western oil group active there. 'But the results have been singularly disappointing.' Another oil company managing director said the war might prompt many disappointed companies to pull out: 'It's now likely, particularly with this setback, that Yemen will be left only with Hunt and CanOxy.' At least two companies, who declioned to be named, said yesterday they expected to close their operations before the end of this year, given their disappointing results and the country's heightened political instability. CanOxy, which is continuing to explore around Masila, has already scaled down any expectations of further big finds. Shell, which has completed drilling in its concession, would say only that it would 'need to look at where we go from here'. Clyde, the UK-based oil company, said yesterday it had received 'some encouragement' from early drilling in its Masila concession and had no intention of leaving. Nevertheless, diminished prospects for Yemeni oil are a serious blow to whatever political arrangement arises from the fighting in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest and most populous land. It perhaps most seriously undermines the economic hand of Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh, the embattled southern leader, who would have depended heavily on oil to support any form of greater economic independence for the south. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh yesterday sacked Prime Minister Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas and named a new defence minister in further measures against rival southern members in Yemen's cabinet, Reuter adds from Sanaa. Mr Saleh named Mohammad al-Attar, industry minister, as acting prime minister and Brig Abed Rabu Hadi as defence minister.   Companies:-  Canadian Occidental Petroleum.     Hunt Oil.

The man who succeeded in making malt powder was William Horlick, an Englishman  who emigrated to Chicago in the 1870s. His process consisted of drying malt  extract with wheat extract in a vacuum. He called the resulting product  Horlick's Food, patented it and set up a business in Racine, Wis. (where he  also married a woman who must have been a cousin -- her maiden name was  Arabella Horlick).

The 19th  Century expression ""the summer sickness"" referred to diseases spread by milk.    Horlick was unhappy about this, so he conceived the idea of making a form of  Horlick's Food that wouldn't have to be mixed with milk. In 1882 he perfected  the process of drying milk right along with the wheat and malt, making a  product that only needed to be mixed with water.    It was a convenience food as well as a health food.

All of these attractions would have made Horlick's business a success, but as  it happened, there was another factor at that particular time as well. In the  late 19th Century, the Temperance Movement was constantly trying to wean men  away from saloons. One bright idea along these lines was the milk bar, also  known as the ice cream parlor or soda fountain, where only ice cream and  nonalcoholic beverages were served.    Malted milk was a natural for the soda fountain. It was not only nonalcoholic  but regarded as healthful. American taste turned a health food into a pleasure  food, as it would later do with peanut butter and granola.    With tens of thousands of ice cream parlors making him a wealthy man, Horlick  became a public benefactor. He donated a school, a hospital and a park to the  city of Racine.

0,FT943-15503 ,"FT943-15503 _AN-EGHDJAFTFT 940708   FT  08 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru gets oil privatisation drive into gear      By SALLY BOWEN      LIMA   Privatisation of the core assets of Petroperu, Peru's state oil and gas company, has finally got off the ground with the release this week of a preliminary information memorandum. The strategy, devised by Merrill Lynch after technical studies by Arthur D. Little and other industry experts, is to split the company into 11 business units. For most of these a 60 per cent stake will be offered to private sector operators, with the state retaining 40 per cent. Auctions, by sealed bids, will start in October. Some analysts still question the decision to dismember the integrated company for sell-off. Its assets are very mixed, with the upstream operations more attractive than the elderly refineries. Two major oilfields, known as Blocks 8 and X, have proven reserves of 100m and 45m barrels respectively. Current output from the former, located in the northern jungle's Maranon basin, is 33,000 barrels a day. Block X, in the northern coastal basin of Talara, produces some 15,000 b/d. For sale separately are four refineries: La Pampilla, the largest, which serves Lima and the coast; medium-sized Talara on the north coast; the small refinery and terminal at Iquitos on the Amazon River; and Conchan, just south of the capital, which is the sole asphalt producer for the Lima market. Conchan twice failed to find a buyer when offered at auction in late 1992. Most important of the remaining five business units is the Japanese-built pipeline, the only means of transporting crude from the northern jungle fields to the Talara terminal. It now operates at about 40 per cent of its 200,000 b/d capacity and will be offered as a renewable concession for 10 years at a time. Other Petroperu assets up for sale are a gas gathering system, with storage facilities and pipeline; marine terminals and airport fuel plants; the liquefied petroleum gas storage facility in Lima's port of Callao; a lubricants blending plant; and electric power generating facilities in the Talara region. In line with the government's objective of creating competition in the local market, bidders will be subject to certain restrictions: the future operator of La Pampilla, for example, will be barred from purchasing Talara, Conchan or the Callao terminal. Petroperu was created in 1969 when General Velasco's left-wing military regime nationalised the assets of International Petroleum Corporation (a subsidiary of Exxon), Chevron and Belco. The company was charged with all Peru's oil-related activities, from exploration through refining to sales and distribution. In the early years, the state made big investments and some major finds. The 200,000 b/d northern pipeline was built with Japanese financing and the refineries at Talara and La Pampilla were expanded. Decline set in, however, when the international oil price slumped in the early 1980s. The state proved a poor manager, swelling Petroperu's payroll with political appointees and pursuing incoherent pricing policies that left the company badly decapitalised. Foreign investment flows dwindled, then disappeared altogether in the mid-1980s. Peru's crude oil production slumped from 1982's peak of 195,000 b/d to 115,000 b/d in 1991. From being an oil exporter, the country became a net importer. Exploration came to a virtual standstill and reserves shrank to 360m barrels at the end of 1993. New oil legislation passed in August 1993 was designed to attract foreign investors back and, to a certain extent, is doing so. Perupetro, a small state agency, now promotes, negotiates and administers contracts for exploration and production, while Petroperu must compete on equal terms with the private sector. Since 1993, 11 contracts have been negotiated by private oil companies - including Petrotech and Maple Gas of the US and China's Sapet, a subsidiary of China National Petroleum. Perupetro has a similar number of further contracts in the pipeline with, among others, Arco of the US, Elf Aquitaine of France and Spain's Repsol. Occidental Petroleum, Peru's old-established and biggest producer, has also embarked on new exploration and development ventures. Modest investments by private operators - and by a now financially-viable Petroperu - are starting to have an impact on output. This year's First quarter production, at 130,000 b/d, was 5 per cent higher than 1993's. But the oil trade deficit for the quarter still cost the country almost Dollars 18m. Perupetro's new president Mr Alberto Bruce is upbeat about prospects. 'Investors are flocking in,' he says, attributing fresh interest to increased confidence in Peruvian economic management, the attractive legal framework and the decline of terrorism. 'At this rate, we'll have to buy bits of Brazil and Argentina to satisfy all of them.' But Peruvian production costs are high and, so far, the promising geology has failed to throw up any major strikes comparable with Colombia and Ecuador's. By far Peru's biggest prospect so far is the huge Camisea gas fields, discovered in 1986 by Royal Dutch Shell. The company is currently updating feasibility studies and could sign a development contract, perhaps worth Dollars 2bn, late next year. Peru's immediate future looks to be in the hands of the smaller international and national operator. Nut that is not necessarily a disadvantage, according to Mr Roger Alderson, chief executive of Great Western Resources, a medium-sized company prepared to invest Dollars 80m in Peru over the next five years. 'As in Colombia, we smaller firms come in, take the risks and attract the big fish once we start showing results,' he says. 'Peru continues to be the great unexplored.'

Alan Stern, representative of the  administration, told ITAR-TASS by telephone that this project,  dubbed ""fire and ice"", was now being discussed at top level in  the United States and Russia.    According to Stern, the idea of enlisting Russian scientists  and experts in the programme for the exploration of Pluto, the  only planet of the solar system that has still not been reached  by automatic probes, is explained by NASA's current financial  straits. According to expert calculations, the cost of launching  two space probes by means of the most powerful American ""Titan""  carrier-rockets, would by far exceed one billion dollars. This  made the Americans think seriously about the possibility of  launching the Pluto probes by means of the Russian ""Proton""  carrier-rocket.    However, Stern said that NASA's policy towards international  scientific missions is that every side involved in them should  make its own contribution, not merely provide its technology or  render paid services. The Russians, he noted, did not like the  idea of exchanging their Proton rocket for the right to instal  on board the American probe its instrument, weighing not more  than two kilograms, and to paste a label with a Russian symbol  on the external surface of the probe. The Space Research  Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences moved to ""add"" a  Russian jettisonable sonde to each of the two American probes.  They are to be released from the probes approximately 40,000  kilometres from Pluto and to descend: one on the surface of the  planet and the other -- on Pluto's natural satellite Haron. The  sondes are to carry either equipment for measuring the  composition of Pluto's atmosphere or photo- and cine- cameras.    NASA has still not decided what American equipment will be  installed on board the probes, but experts of the Pasadena Jet  Propulsion Laboratory in California, who specialise in long-term  projects for the exploration of planets of the solar system,  move to install only four instruments.    Pluto is the most distant known planet from the sun. It was  discovered 62 years ago. Its period of revolution around the  sun is 250.6 years. The composition of the planet's atmosphere  is unknown. Welsy Huntress, chief of the NASA department for  studying the solar system, is sure that the Pluto fight  programme should be among the first on the list of scientific  priorities. NASA believes that it is inexpedient to further put  off its elaboration. In order to direct a probe towards Pluto  it is necessary to use Jupiter's gravitational field to boost  it. This will be possible only if the space vehicle is launched  in the period between 2001 and 2003.    The solar project also stipulates the launching of an  American probe, which would split in two upon approaching the  sun: into a Russian part carrying an optical telescope, and an  American part -- with instruments to study the physics of the  plasma on board.

0,FT931-6966 ,"FT931-6966 _AN-DBZCKAFDFT 930226   FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Overseas side helps stem fall at British Gas - Warmer weather, loss of market share and lower domestic prices blamed for downturn      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   BRITISH Gas saw profits in its core UK business decline by Pounds 276m in 1992 as a result of warmer weather, loss of market share and lower prices for the supply of household gas. But this was partly offset by an increase in earnings from the company's overseas divisions. On 12 months' turnover of Pounds 10.25bn (Pounds 10.49bn) group pre-tax profits came out at Pounds 1.05bn, after exceptional charges of Pounds 320m, compared with Pounds 1.71bn. Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's director of finance, pointed to a strong improvement in fourth quarter profits at the exploration and production division, where income doubled from Pounds 60m to Pounds 128m, following the increase in production at its South Morecambe bay field in the North Sea. For the full year, exploration and production, where most revenues come from overseas, increased slightly to Pounds 224m compared with Pounds 221m. The overseas gas supply business saw a rise in profits for the year to Pounds 137m, against Pounds 125m, following an increase in sales volumes abroad and a drop in the purchase price of gas. The rise came mainly in the fourth quarter, which accounted for Pounds 42m (Pounds 33m). Mr Robert Evans, chairman, said the overseas divisions provided a 'welcome contribution,' to profits, accounting for roughly 25 per cent of the total. He hoped the two divisions would provide 60 per cent of profits by the end of the decade. The profits of the UK gas business fell from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 1.2bn last year. Factors behind the decline were the warmer weather, which accounted for Pounds 140m of the drop; the squeeze on prices as a result of the tough new formula imposed by the regulator, leading to a fall of Pounds 50m; and the loss of market share in the industrial market, taking out Pounds 70m. Non-gas costs also increased and pipeline revenues improved. In the final quarter of 1992, the UK gas business showed a roughly stable profit of Pounds 626m, compared with Pounds 636m. Earnings per share were 15.8p for the full year, compared with 27.3p. In the final quarter earnings per share were 5.4p (11.3p). The company declared a final dividend of 7.8p, which made a total for the year of 14.2p - a rise of some 6 per cent from 10.25p for the previous 12 months. Mr Rogerson said: 'The policy of increasing the dividend in real terms and the ability to maintain it depends to a significant degree on the outcome of the MMC inquiry.' British Gas is currently under review by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The company had a net cash outflow of Pounds 1.5bn, slightly higher than analysts had forecast. This was chiefly because of heavier tax and dividend payments during the 12 months after changing the reporting period from the tax year to the calendar year. British Gas's level of gearing rose to 33 per cent from 25 per cent.   Companies:-  British Gas.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4923 Gas Transmission and Distribution.

0,FT934-3822 ,"FT934-3822 _AN-DLGD5AFIFT 931207   FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: South African company removes its veil - Mobil divestment Engen is planning its brave new future      By ROBERT CORZINE   Appeals for foreign investment have replaced demands for divestment in the lexicon of most black politicians in South Africa. But some strategic sectors of the South African economy, such as its sprawling defence industry and oil companies, have stayed shrouded in secrecy even as the political process opened up. That veil is now lifting, with international investors being able to assess the long-term viability of some of South Africa's largest companies. Politics, however, still exert a strong influence over the future strategy of many such companies, including Engen, the country's biggest oil company, which was created by the divestment in 1989 of Mobil Oil's South African subsidiary. Unlike other divestments, in which the foreign parent company retained the right to re-acquire its South African assets, the break with Mobil was a 'clean one', according to Mr Rob Angel, chief executive. That, combined with Engen's unbundling last month from Gencor, the industrial and mining group that bought Mobil's assets, has given Mr Angel a free hand. But the absence of international support means the company is subject to domestic constraints, such as a foreign currency shortage, which act as a brake on its ambitions. Engen, which will get the bulk of its Dollars 2.4bn estimated turnover this year from oil refining and marketing in South Africa and neighbouring countries, is keen to use its new-found freedom to add international upstream production to its domestic downstream business. It is also keen to secure a London listing, although such a move will have wait until after next April's election. Greater access to foreign exchange is crucial if Engen is to realise its goal to source 50 per cent of its crude oil needs from its own reserves within 10 years. Mr Chris Sloan, an analyst at Johannesburg stockbrokers Ferguson Brothers, says the lack of foreign exchange is one reason why Engen has 'not been very successful' in its early exploration efforts. 'It means they can't go for the highest quality exploration opportunities.' Mr Angel concedes that Engen has had to pass up acquisition opportunities because of currency restrictions. Its exploration activities are focused on west Africa, where it shares licences with big multi-national oil companies in Angola, Gabon and Namibia. It has a 2.2 per cent share of the Alba field in the North Sea, as well as a small holding in the Britannia gas field and a 10 per cent share in the Bukha gas condensate development off Oman. The company is looking to buy, although it is likely to remain on a small scale until it has greater access to hard currency. Acquisitions are also likely in the downstream side of the business in Africa, says Mr Angel, who wants Engen to have a 'leadership role' in exporting and distributing refined products to the sub-Saharan market. That goal is probably attainable, according to Mr Sloan, who says one legacy of sanctions is the highly efficient refineries which the government encouraged oil companies to build. Engen's main Durban refinery has been subject to a number of upgrades which will boost its capacity to 105,000 barrels a day. That will allow it to capitalise on growing demand in Africa north of the Limpopo river, which forms the border with Zimbabwe, and to which the company's exports have risen from 1.9m barrels in 1991 to 5.7m barrels this year. Deregulation in South Africa's refining and retail market is likely to pose the biggest challenge to Engen's fortunes. 'There is an increasingly public and political debate over the oil industry,' says one Cape Town-based industry analyst, who believes the issue is likely to be left for a new government. Full deregulation of the market is unlikely, but the formula used by the government to set wholesale and retail prices will probably be replaced by a mechanism 'which more accurately reflects world prices', says Mr Sloan. Mr Angel believes deregulation will allow Engen to close some of the low volume units among its 1,500 petrol stations without undermining its 26 per cent market share. But deregulation is also likely to create a new retail competitor. Sasol, the synthetic oil from coal company that provides 45 per cent of the country's petrol, is keen to enter the retail market with its own service stations. At present Sasol is limited to a single pump at the stations of other companies. The government-set floor price for Sasol is Dollars 23 a barrel, compared with current world oil prices of Dollars 16-Dollars 17 a barrel. A new government will be under financial pressures to reduce the protection that Sasol receives, but it will probably hesitate to remove it altogether because of the drastic effect such a step would have on employment at the vast Sasol plants and the coal mines which supply them. The prospect of much fiercer domestic competition and Engen's heavy exposure to refining and marketing lies behind the drive to secure its own sources of crude oil, according to analysts, as a strong production base would allow it to benefit from any increase in crude oil prices. But Mr Angel concedes that only a return to economic growth in South Africa can underpin the company's longer-term performance.   Companies:-  Engen.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

But Administration officials said the proposal is under serious consideration  and indicated that it is likely to be adopted as part of the panel's  recommendations in a final report to President Bush at the end of the year.    Because most existing offshore oil rigs in the Los Angeles area are located in  waters already subject to local control, the plan would be of great  significance only if new drilling were to proceed in additional areas  controlled by the federal government.    In that case, an AQMD official said Thursday, emissions from new drilling  platforms off Southern California could spew more than 16 tons of  smog-producing pollutants into the atmosphere each day by early in the next  century unless the air quality board gains regulatory authority.    The Administration panel, chaired by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., was  directed to determine whether the government should proceed with its  controversial drilling plans off Southern California and in other areas off  Northern California and south Florida.      Progress Report    Its progress report, which is to be published in the Federal Register today,  states that the panel is still considering all options presented to it. They  range from imposing a permanent ban on oil exploration in the areas to allowing  the Interior Department to proceed unhindered with its drilling plans.    Most of the document, however, is devoted to discussion of measures that would  allow oil exploration to proceed, albeit with more stringent controls than now  exist. Some of the plans mentioned would prohibit drilling in certain areas,  but most would add new regulations designed to protect the environment.

""I don't think there's any question that air quality is the primary issue in  the public mind,"" said Richard Glynn, the panel's deputy executive director.    A task force decision to recommend new drilling in Southern California would  come as little surprise to anti-drilling activists, who have charged that the  panel is predisposed to favor oil exploration. In addition, many have  acknowledged that the proposed Southern California offshore exploration area is  the least environmentally sensitive of those under scrutiny.

Hurd said: ""We could possibly  agree on broad cooperation"" on the oil exploration the Kelpers  want to initiate by the end of the year in the waters  surrounding the Malvinas Islands. British sources told CLARIN on  12 March that Hurd made this remark to Di Tella during a meeting  last week in London.    As CLARIN already announced, this definition will be the new  basis for the position the British will champion late this month  or in early April when negotiations attempting to achieve some  form of cooperation on the oil issue will be resumed.  Negotiations have been suspended since late 1992, when the  United Kingdom unilaterally decided to initiate seismic  prospecting work in the sea bed surrounding the Malvinas Islands  despite Argentine protests.    Initially, Hurd talked about cooperation alone, which  ideally  represented exchanging information. British sources announced  that, in diplomatic parlance, however, this new definition means  that London ""is willing to accept the participation of Argentine  companies in the exploration effort and the replenishment and  repair of oil platforms in Argentine ports."" A similar message  was conveyed by the British ambassador in Buenos Aires, Peter  Hall, to Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella during a  meeting they held on 7 March to discuss the crisis in Yugoslavia.    Nevertheless, this is not the final British position. Hurd  will travel on 9 April to the Malvinas Islands for consultations  with the islanders -- who refuse to restore communications with  Argentina -- before initiating negotiations with Buenos Aires.  The Malvinas Islands' residents only are willing to cooperate  with Argentina ""if necessary"" and are moving ahead -- full steam  -- with their preparations: They already have received a Royal  Geological Service report recommending where to drill in order  to determine the existence of oil and establishing the required  legal or tax framework.    Incidentally, this is one of the most difficult points for  negotiations that demonstrates that both oil and fishing are  closely linked to the sovereignty conflict. Argentina wants to  collect part of the taxes that will be charged to the oil  companies, but the United Kingdom rejects this possibility, even  though it is not yet known with complete certainty if there is  oil.    Florencio Acenolaza, the Chamber of Deputies Foreign  Relations Committee chairman and a geologist by profession,  recently noted in a communique that there is no oil in the  Malvinas Islands' submarine shelf.    YPF [Government Oil Deposits] President Jose Estenssoro  quickly went to the Foreign Ministry to make it clear that  Acenolaza based himself ""on outdated information"" and that YPF  is studying one of the two seismic surveys carried out in the  Malvinas Islands last year. Official sources confirmed to  CLARIN that the survey was purchased through a YPF subsidiary.  The report is confidential because it is a commercial secret.    Nevertheless, the existence of hydrocarbons will not be  proven until the sea bed is drilled, despite the positive  seismic reports. The basins may be empty, with more gas than oil  or with little oil, which would make the business unprofitable.     "

The establishment of a flourishing gold market in northern Liaoning province near the Soviet border almost certainly poses the most severe threat in years to the People's Bank's domination of the gold trade. 'Some stores trade gold bars, not just gold jewellery. See that's serious. Of course, we're worried there will be more such markets,' said a People's Bank official this week. In an official statement the People's Bank, the country's central bank, has accused those responsible for the Liaoning market of spreading disorder in the gold jewellery market. It charged that gold merchants had 'harassed' the state purchase plan. Under present rules, the bank is empowered to acquire all gold produced in China at about Yuan50 (USDollars 8.70) a gram, two-thirds of the world price. Miners blame the depressed purchase price for lagging production, which reached about 110 tonnes last year, compared with demand of 250 tonnes. The China Daily said this week that the authorities were considering sweeping reforms, including price-reform, in the gold sector to boost production. The paper reported that gold production had declined in the first quarter this year, although it also observed that some miners may be withholding production from the state for sale on the booming local market. Under China's present five-year plan (1991-1995) USDollars 1.3bn of investment in gold mines is proposed with the aim of increasing production by 40 per cent by 1996. At present rates of production growth it seems unlikely China that will reach that target. News of the Liaoning gold market and reports that Beijing is considering seriously the establishment of a Gold Exchange coincide with reports that China has emerged as the world's largest gold consumer. According to Gold Fields Mineral Services in its annual report 'Gold 1993' Chinese passion for gold jewellery, a desire by Chinese to hedge against a depreciating currency and heavy gold purchases by the People's Bank contributed to the gold buying spree. The report said that the Chinese central bank might have purchased a substantial portion of the 400 tonnes of gold sold by the Netherlands central bank last year. China has not published gold reserve figures since 1981. The People's Bank official described the Liaoning market as 'a very sensitive problem'', adding that the State Council, or Cabinet, had not resolved what to do about the unauthorised gold dealing, which appears to have been sanctioned by local officials, but not necessarily by the provincial government. Chinese officials have recently indicated an interest in involving foreign mining companies in the exploration and exploitation of China's gold deposits, but this would require amendments to regulations that expressly forbid such foreign involvement. China has devoted much of its minerals exploration and development budget to the search for gold in the past two decades with limited success. Estimates of in-ground gold reserves stand at about 3,000 tonnes and were being added to at the rate of about 10 per cent annually.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P1041 Gold Ores.

0,FT934-2580 ,"FT934-2580 _AN-DLMDEAEHFT 931213   FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (6): Taking the long view - US majors make the best of a tough situation      By RICHARD WATERS   Like tankers moving calmly over choppy waters, the giant US energy groups pretend that they float serenely above the turbulence of the world's troubled oil markets. In reality, their progress is not so smooth. True, the latest dip in the oil price is unlikely to interrupt the companies' long-term exploration and production plans - as long as it proves short-lived. But it will force the oil majors to give a further painful turn of the screw to the extensive cost-cutting they have already undertaken. And it will make more unattainable the goal of achieving a satisfactory return on capital. Most say their investment plans, while based on an oil price somewhat higher than the current level, are tested against prices of Dollars 15 a barrel or less. That makes them able to withstand troughs in the oil market. Nor do the big oil groups believe prices will stay at present levels for a sustained period. 'We don't see any deep fundamental change in our view (as a result of the recent price fall),' says Mr Ken Haley, manager of energy forecasting at Chevron. 'The market is at the lower end of its long-term sustainable level,' which Chevron puts at Dollars 18-Dollars 23 a barrel. Mr Alfred DeCrane, chairman and chief executive of Texaco, also expresses optimism about the price of oil: 'We haven't bet the store on it going up - but I haven't sold my stock.' He adds, though, that in the short term, lower prices mean 'we won't be getting in the front door what we thought we would be getting'. The fall in upstream earnings as a result of lower oil prices will put the energy groups under even greater pressure to husband their cash resources to support the investments necessary for long-term success. For two reasons, those investments are likely to get bigger rather than smaller. First, exploration and development spending is being ploughed into ever-bigger ventures outside the US in pursuit of the sort of massive discoveries which will provide long-term returns. Most mature US fields are no longer worth developing for big companies with large overheads to cover, while potential new large finds in Alaska or beyond the US's continental shelf are put out of reach by environmental concerns. A falling oil price has further reduced the attractions of exploring for oil in the US. Tax rates on oil production in the US are lower than in most overseas areas: this means that, when prices fall, the producer suffers more. In overseas markets, more of that pain is born by the taxpayer (the opposite is true when prices rise.) Not surprisingly, with the exception of a handful of giant fields in deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico, all the talk in the US now is of the development work in the former Soviet republics, the East China Sea or the North Sea. Investment budgets have followed this change in emphasis. Texaco's capital spending in the US has averaged Dollars 1.77bn a year over the past five years and is projected to continue unchanged at this level for the next five. Investment outside the US, by contrast, is expected to rise from Dollars 1.45bn a year to an average Dollars 2.12bn. Likewise, Chevron says three quarters of its Dollars 2.6bn capital investment on upstream activities this year has been spent outside the US. To support this move overseas, and at the same time cut costs, most US groups have disposed of marginal on-shore US fields. Texaco had 1,000 US oil and gas fields three years ago: by the end of next year, the number will be down to under 500. The second significant need for cash is in the US, where ever-more demanding environmental standards are forcing companies to upgrade their refineries both to produce cleaner fuels and to cut their own emissions. Few companies think they will be able to recover through higher fuel prices much of what they spend on revamping their refineries. Chevron, the largest refiner in the US, has put two refineries up for sale, representing around a quarter of its US refining capacity. 'It may not make sense to invest in all sites,' says Mr Donald Schmude of Texaco, which is also reviewing whether it can afford to upgrade all its US refinery facilities. In part, the refinery sales are part of a broader rationalisation of the US refining and marketing system. A flat gasoline market has forced companies to rethink their marketing strategies, concentrating their service stations into regional groupings close to their own refineries in an effort to cut costs and build market share. Service stations or refineries that do not fit into this pattern have been sold first. So far, refineries have changed hands rather than close down altogether. That could change, though, when the next phase of federal rules on gasoline standards comes into force at the beginning of 1995, says Mr DeCrane of Texaco: 'the need to spend to keep those refineries open will rise, and there will be closures of refineries in the US.' Against a domestic background of shrinking exploration and production and a downstream business facing significant (and probably irrecoverable) investment, it is not surprising that the US energy industry is living in reduced circumstances. By building reserves abroad, though, US oil is laying down the foundation for a more significant international presence well into the 21st century.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Lord Ashburton, the chairman who led the coup against the former chairman and chief executive Mr Robert Horton, is to retire next July 1. He will be succeeded by Mr David Simon, the current chief executive. He in turn will be succeeded by Mr John Browne, head of the company's exploration arm. Lord Ashburton had always intended to step down after three years as chairman, and the changes announced yesterday were 'an example of continuity'. The timing of the announcement, on Budget Day, was dictated by the need to inform staff before a top-level planning session for 1995 which begins tonight. Those involved in the changes stressed that they did not imply any shift in the strategy which BP set itself after the ousting of Mr Horton. This is based on a drive to reduce the company's large debts, tighten the integration of its operations, and achieve 'disciplined growth'. All the executives involved in the reshuffle have been closely involved in managing BP's recovery from the losses which resulted from Mr Horton's expansionist strategies. Mr Simon, who took over as chief executive in 1992, will become a non-executive chairman, spending three or four days a week at BP. He said it was important to separate the role of chairman and chief executive. Mr Browne, who is 47, has held a variety of posts at BP including group treasurer. Most recently he headed a successful expansion of the company's oil and gas reserves. The new head of exploration will be Mr Rodney Chase, the managing director with responsibility for the western hemisphere and corporate affairs. Mr Russell Seal, chief executive of BP Oil, the downstream arm, will take on a new set of responsibilities to oversee the further integration of the group. His position will be taken by Mr Rolf Stomberg who heads BP's European oil operations. The announcement of the changes comes at the end of a year in which BP's finances have staged a solid recovery. In the first quarter, the company paid its first dividend increase since the coup, and by the third quarter it had reduced its debts from Dollars 16bn to around Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6bn). The company has also been boosted by substantial oil discoveries in Colombia and west of Shetlands, as well as a recent gas find in Vietnam. Mr Browne intended to seek further growth for the company by emphasising the role of gas. He also saw opportunities to 'deepen' BP's position in the refining and downstream markets, such as in eastern Europe and Asia. BP's chemicals business had undergone expansion which would enable it to take advantage of the current upswing in chemical markets. Mr Simon said that BP's dividend policy would continue to be reviewed on a a quarterly basis. 'We would like to progressively grow the dividend if we have a sustainable financial performance,' he said.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Depending on the location of the drilling activities, the mixture of used oil and crude oil may need to be transported (by vessel, truck, rail, etc.) to a separate location for introduction into the pipeline or the petroleum refining facility. In the case of off-shore drilling sites for example, conveyance of the mixture may involve multiple modes of transportation (i.e., from the off-shore platform to land by vessel or pipeline and then to the crude oil pipeline by land-based transport). Today's exemption covers all modes of transportation of mixtures of used oil and crude or natural gas liquids, as long as the mixture contains less than 1% used oil and is destined for insertion into a petroleum refining facility process at a point prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. In addition, today's exemption covers storage of mixtures of used oil and crude oil, provided that the mixture contains less than 1% used oil and is inserted into a petroleum refining facility process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking.     Used oil that is generated at exploration and production sites continues to be subject to used oil generator standards prior to being mixed with crude oil such that it is exempt under today's rule. Used oil that is generated off-site and transported to or stored at an exploration and production site is subject to the transporter and transfer facility standards, as applicable, up until the point at which the used oil is mixed with crude oil such that it is exempt under 279.10(g)(2).     EPA is exempting mixtures of used oil and crude oil held in discrete units at a refinery or at remote locations because the Agency understands that the amount of used oil contained in these mixtures is extremely small relative to the large quantities of crude oil. In developing today's rule, EPA held numerous discussions with petroleum refinery industry representatives regarding the maximum amount of used oil contained in mixtures of used oil and crude oil that are destined for insertion into a petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. Industry representatives repeatedly informed the Agency that used oil constitutes less than 1% of these mixtures. In gathering information for today's rule, EPA held conference calls with representatives from a number of petroleum refining companies (e.g., Mobil Oil Corporation and Phillips Petroleum Inc.,). The Agency also conducted several site visits, including visits to an Amoco refinery in Whiting, Indiana and a Mobil Oil Corporation refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey. In each case, EPA was informed that used oil does not currently, and will not comprise greater than 1% of the crude oil/used oil mixture because of the sheer volumes of crude oil that are continuously being produced and processed relative to the amount of used oil that is generated at production sites or refineries. This recent information is consistent with comments submitted in response to the 1985 Used Oil Proposed Rule in which Exxon Company, USA stated that the average percentage of used oil in refinery feed stock streams is less than 0.02% and Texaco, Inc., indicated that used oil would constitute no more than 0.01% of the refinery input.     EPA does not believe it is necessary to apply the used oil management standards to the less than 1% fraction of used oil that is being held temporarily in discrete units or transported from those units to the pipeline or the petroleum refinery for recycling as part of a mixture that is composed overwhelmingly of crude oil. In essence, because of the high ratio of crude oil to used oil, EPA considers the mixture to be equivalent to crude oil for regulatory purposes. EPA's part 279 standards were designed to control those particular risks associated with the management of used oil (e.g., uncontrolled burning, improper storage practices by used oil handlers) pursuant to section 3014 of RCRA.     The reason for EPA's imposition of a 1% limit on the amount of used oil contained in mixtures of used oil and crude oil being stored or transported to a crude oil pipeline or petroleum refinery prior to insertion into the refining process is that, while we have determined that the small amounts of used oil that are being added to crude oil under current practices pose no incremental risk over normal crude oil, we have not evaluated whether larger amounts of used oil also pose no incremental risk. Given the information provided to EPA by the petroleum refining industry regarding the inherent limitations on the amount of used oil that is or should be contained in mixtures of used oil and crude oil (i.e., less than 1%), and given that EPA has received no information, either recently, or in response to previous rulemakings that provides basis for an alternative limit, the Agency sees no point in imposing a higher cap. Imposition of a higher cap could have the effect of encouraging mixing of used oil with crude oil that would not otherwise occur during the normal course of petroleum refining operations. Such an incentive might lead to increased incremental risk from management of large amounts of used oil, exempt from the part 279 standards, at petroleum refineries. EPA also concluded that a less precise limit (i.e., ``    de minimis    '' or ``small amounts''), as was suggested by some commenters from the petroleum refining industry, would needlessly cause uncertainty, given that EPA was told repeatedly that amounts currently introduced are far less than 1%.

As the trail moves north towards the border with Vietnam, engineers from the British company run the risk of detonating unexploded mines with the monitors they carry to survey the local geology. In South America, British Petroleum faces possible disruption to its Dollars 200m oil-drilling programme in the foothills of Colombia from attacks by left-wing guerrillas. Across the globe, Chevron finally signed an agreement this week with the government of Kazakhstan, a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, to develop a potentially huge oilfield in the Caspian Sea. The company has been negotiating the deal for four years amid the shifting allegiances of politics in the former Soviet Union. In spite of such obstacles, the world's oil industry is increasingly keen to develop what it describes as a 'frontier strategy' as it moves away from fields which are running dry. The drive for expansion has been matched by the opening of traditionally closed markets by new governments which are more accommodating towards western oil companies than their predecessors. These governments - from Vietnam to Russia - are seeking to exploit mineral resources to expand hard currency earnings as they reform their economies. But faced with global credit shortages they realise that they will not find the capital they need to develop their resources from the international banking community alone. The cash demands are huge. Dr Subroto, secretary-general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), estimates that its 13 members alone need some Dollars 25bn in capital over the next decade to complete their capacity expansion plans to meet rising world demand. Western oil companies can provide investment funds and sophisticated technology in return for access to oil reserves. In exchange for exploration licences, companies usually fund the costs of searching for oil and, if they find it, pay the host government in oil and royalties. Mr Dan Yergin, who heads Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an oil consulting group, and the author of The Prize, a best-selling history of the oil industry, calls this a 'new bargain' between countries and companies. 'It is the antithesis of what we saw in the 1970s when a wave of nationalism across the world led to many of these companies being thrown out of countries they were operating in,' he says. 'The great question then was - what is the future of the traditional oil company outside of a few areas such as the North Sea and North America?' that their frontier strategy provides an answer to that question. These companies are unlikely to see large production growth in the North Sea, which has been so well explored that there is little chance of further big discoveries. Similarly, they are leaving North America where the environmental lobby has prevented them drilling in large parts of the country. Mr Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil, the second-largest US oil company, says the most attractive areas for drilling in the US - offshore California and parts of Alaska - have been closed to the industry following concerns over pollution and environmental damage after the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster in March 1989. 'We're sitting on two tracts we've purchased, but are not being allowed to drill because of pressure from local environmental lobbies,' he said. The search for new fields is given urgency by the failure of the large oil companies to maintain reserves. 'So many companies have done a poor job of replacing their reserves,' says Mr Robin West who advises companies on their frontier strategies at Petroleum Finance Company, the Washington-based consulting group. 'They are now being forced to turn from quick pay-out, low-risk investment in the North Sea and North America to riskier prospects.' British Petroleum, for instance, failed to replenish its oil reserves during much of the 1980s - the level of its proven oil reserves dropped by 4 per cent last year - largely as a result of its concentration in the mature oilfields of the North Sea and Alaska. For British Petroleum, as for the other big companies, the elephant' - a discovery estimated to contain 1bn barrels of oil or more. A find of this size would secure long-term reserves and should ensure earnings growth for at least a decade. Mr Kenneth Derr, chairman of Chevron, says this is why his company was so patient in its attempts to exploit Kazakhstan's Tengiz field. 'It is unique in terms of size, and could have a meaningful impact on a company of our size for a very long time.' The Tengiz field is estimated to contain recoverable reserves of between six and nine billion barrels - approximately twice the remaining recoverable reserves in the UK. Once Chevron's joint venture project goes ahead its share in Tengiz could raise the company's worldwide production of 1.2m barrels per day by an estimated 10 per cent over three years and as much as another 500,000 barrels per day by the turn of the century. The lure of such large discoveries is a powerful incentive for companies to focus on frontier drilling, but the risks are huge. Oil exploration is a notoriously hit and miss affair in the best-researched locations and frontier strategies increase the risk that companies will be investing in dry holes. 'At the end of the day, you have some very high-tech data on the geology, but you are making subjective judgments and half of the wells you drill are dry,' said Mr Brian Lee, general manager of exploration at Lasmo. Clyde Petroleum, a British exploration company, was disappointed when its Dollars 8m investment in offshore drilling in Vietnam turned sour last year. The company found a gas reservoir, but it turned out to be carbon dioxide. British Petroleum hopes to minimise the risks of its frontier strategy by targeting areas where its sophisticated technology can make a significant contribution to extracting oil from known reserves. In many developing countries, known oil deposits have not been exploited because of inadequate technology and equipment. The use of sophisticated technology, however, does not remove the political risk in some countries, where governments can be unstable and liable to turn hostile to western companies. In spite of such risks and the costs, frontier strategy is a trend that will continue. 'We are seeing virtually the full departure of the 15 largest companies from drilling onshore in North America,' said Mr Tom Petrie, industry analyst at Petrie Parkman, a US consulting group. Their departure for new frontiers marks a return to the high-stakes competition of the early years of oil exploration and may herald a shake up in the ranks of the leading oil companies. For the 1990s, the industry's winners and losers will probably depend on who takes the risks, who strikes a deal in the republics of the former Soviet Union or who gets lucky in the jungles of Laos.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman  said the zone on the Vietnamese continental shelf should be  transferred to the disputed Spratly island chain, adding that an  exploration contract Vietnam has signed with the Mobil oil  company was ""illegal.""    ""The Blue Dragon sea area belongs to the adjacent waters of  the Nansha islands,"" he said, using the Chinese name for the  Spratlys -- claimed in whole or in part by Vietnam, China,  Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan and the Philippines. His statement was  the clearest claim of sovereignty over this region yet made by  the Chinese. They have not made any protests over the search  for oil in the Great Bear (Dai Hung) field being carried out by  several companies for the Vietnamese government. The state-run  PetroVietnam oil company is working with Mobil on exploring the  Blue Dragon (Than Long) field, which the Vietnamese government  claims is not part of the Spratlys.    China's latest claim will further complicate the  international bargaining for control of the archipelago. The  hundreds of isles, atolls and sea rocks in the Spratlys are in  one of the busiest sea lanes in the world. All vessels going  from Japan to the Middle East and Europe pass by.    But the enormous riches waiting to be exploited under the  seabed are at the centre of growing diplomatic sabre rattling.  Vietnam, which has a presence on around 20 of the atolls, last  week launched a veiled warning about Beijing's intentions in the  South China Sea. The government called for measures to ease  tensions and ""avoid complicating the situation and without  resorting to force or threats of force."" A diplomat in Beijing  said ""the Chinese have never hidden their ambitions in the  region and now they are pushing even further to keep Vietnam out  of what they consider to be a `Chinese lake.'""    The Chinese have given exploration rights in a  25,000-kilometre (10,000-square mile) zone west of the Spratlys  to a U.S. firm, Crestone Energy Corp. The zone is only 250  kilometres (160 miles) from the Vietnamese coast, but Crestone  say they have been promised Chinese naval protection. Hanoi has  in turn claimed that the Crestone deal is illegal because the  zone is on the Vietnamese continental shelf. ""Beijing seems to  be attempting to set a frontier that Hanoi can only cross at the  risk of a naval clash like in 1988,"" said the diplomat. Three  Vietnamese vessels were sunk and 76 sailors killed during a  brief clash with the Chinese navy in 1988.    Though Sino-Vietnamese relations were normalised in 1991,  their territorial dispute remains outstanding. China has  strengthened its presence in the South China Sea and has  launched a modernisation programme aimed at making its navy one  of the world's most powerful by the next century. The air force  now has Russian Su-27 long-range bombers and are building an air  base on the Paracels islands -- another South China Sea  archipelago claimed by China and Vietnam. Vietnam's navy was not  strong enough to dispute the 1988 conflict and according to  military experts has weakened further since.     "

The results were  obtained through Roman Oil, a U.S. company stationed in Houston  that was used as a cover by Government Oil Deposits (YPF) to buy  the maps. According to a top source in the Malvinas government,  YPF is the first and only oil company so far to pay $3.2 million  for the seismic maps.    Great Britain approved legislation two years ago allowing  the  Falklands Islands Government to start seismic studies in the  area. Argentina reacted by sending ""letters of discomfort""  [preceding three words in English] to oil companies warning them  that any activities carried out in the waters around the  Malvinas Islands without its consent could lead to a legal  conflict in the future.    Without taking the threat into account, the island's  government granted the license to carry out the studies to Geko  Prakla (U.S. company) and Spectrum (British), which put the  study results up for sale late last year.    This daily was able to learn that it was suspicious to the  island's government that the first oil company interested in  buying the maps was Roman Oil, an oil company never heard of  before by the island's advisers, the British Geological Survey.  This is why the Kelpers did not hesitate to put a good method of  investigation into operation.    Since the islanders believed the seismic studies could be  very valuable to Argentina, they started investigating from that  side. The first thing they learned was that Gaffny Klain, a  British consultant with an office in Houston that advises the  Argentine Government on oil matters, had recommended the  purchase of the survey made by Geko Prakla and Spectrum. But  they were not able to learn much about Roman Oil, which has a  telephone not listed in the Houston directory.    Finally, their links to the companies that carried out the  seismic studies turned suspicion to reality: YPF was the real  name of the mysterious oil company that bought the maps,  according to confirmation made unofficially by Spectrum and Geko  Prakla to the Falklands Islands Government.    The Malvinas government gets a percentage of the survey  result's sale.    There are no secrets on the island. A kelper said: ""It is  the type of community that when one goes to the supermarket and  buys cereal the neighbor does not eat, he would come and ask if  there is something wrong with your stomach."" This is why the  news spreads real fast among its 2,000 inhabitants.    Adviser Wendy Teggart said: ""It is a rumor but it seems that  YPF bought the seismic studies."" But she immediately said it was  true by adding: ""It is better for us because if YPF decides to  buy the license, it would mean a recognition in some way of the  Falklands Islands Government's sovereignty over its waters.""    When Great Britain began the search for oil in the islands  without consulting Argentina, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella  said it would be impossible for Great Britain to continue the  process on those terms because no oil company would risk  millions of dollars in waters that are under disputed  sovereignty.    The island's government members who were asked by this daily  said that if there is indeed exploitable oil in large  quantities, no international oil companies, and certainly not  those that have no interest in Argentina, will be stopped by a  juridical dispute. They said the first proof that business is  more important than conflicts over sovereignty is the fact that  the first company that bought the seismic studies was  Argentina's YPF. At any rate, they said, this information will  help the Argentine Government in the high-level meeting on  hydrocarbons to be held with the Foreign Office late in March or  early April in Buenos Aires.    The Argentine Foreign Ministry will say in the meeting that  the search for oil will need cooperation between Argentina and  the kelpers. This is what the government has been saying since  the British went ahead with the seismic survey without  consultation, which is the first, and most simple, and less  costly step of the process.    The result of the survey involving a study of the terrain  through probes was ""optimistic."" The survey said there may be  oil in the islands. And the only way to prove it is to go ahead  with the second stage: the exploration that involves drilling  in territory claimed by Argentina and Great Britain.    Meanwhile, David Camp, the island's attorney general, is  going ahead in drawing up legislation for issuing exploration  and exploitation licenses. What happens is that because of the  investment required in drilling exploration wells, the licenses  that will be attractive to the oil companies are those that  guarantee -- if oil is found -- their indisputable rights for 20  or 30 years for the third and last stage: exploitation.    The current subject of conversation among the kelpers is the  possibility of finding oil in the islands. Their main concern is  that the oil companies may damage the islands' ecological  balance and cause massive immigration, changing the life style  of their small community.    To answer this type of question, the islands government has  recently contracted the services of the company Environment  Resources Management (ERM), which within three months will  deliver a report on the impact the discovery of oil would have  on the islands. It also sent a delegation to the North Sea and  began paying the salary of Alex Camp, an internationally known  oil tax expert.    The possibility of discussing the oil issue with Argentina  is  not yet in the kelpers' plans. The only thing they are sure of  is that YPF bought the survey studies, and that they will be  absent in the discussions if the meeting on hydrocarbons between  Argentina and Britain is held in Buenos Aires.

Good spirits at Shell headquarters in the Syrian capital, however, are balanced by the gloom among other foreign explorers, who have little to show for the USDollars 200m-plus they are estimated to have invested in Syria since 1988. 'This is the year when reality sinks in,' said the representative of an American company which has been unsuccessful, thus far, in its efforts to find oil and gas. British Petroleum has already announced that it is pulling out, and others, including Enron, the small American independent, are expected to follow suit. For the more than half dozen oil explorers who were attracted by Shell's successes in the mid-1980s, Syria has proved disappointing. For Shell itself, success has followed upon success, and with its partner, Deminex of West Germany, it is continuing to make finds in its Ash Sham concession whose lease expires in May this year. Shell officials are coy about production figures, and about reserves in their exploration zone, but the company, through its Al Furat operating company (in which the Syrian Petroleum Company has a 50 per cent share), is reliably reported to be pumping about 345,000 barrels a day of light, easily marketable crude from its Deir ez Zawr and Ash Sham fields. With the additional finds made recently, it may well lift production to a considerably higher plateau. Assuming that the Syrian Petroleum Company is producing 160,000-80,000 b/d of heavy, sulphurous crude from its well-established Sweidiyeh field in Syria's north-east corner, Syrian total production is now comfortably above 500,000 b/d. About two-thirds of production is available for export. Latest balance of payment figures, included in the IMF's Article IV report on the Syrian economy, show that oil sales, as well as new aid flows from the Gulf as reward for Damascus's support of the anti-Iraq alliance in the Gulf war, dramatically improved Syria's financial position in 1990-91. Earnings from oil in 1990 attained nearly USDollars 2bn. The figure was lower, about USDollars 1.7bn last year, because of the softer oil market. Grants and soft loans from the Gulf totalled USDollars 1.5bn in 1990-91, sharply improving Syria's overall balance of payments in those years. According to an IMF forecast, however, Syria's payment's position will again start to become precarious this year. That is certain to add to pressures for more rapid exploitation of Syrian reserves, which now stand officially at about 1.7bn barrels. Mr Mtanios Habib, Syria's oil minister, said last June that within two years Syria aimed to treble production. That is almost certainly over-ambitious, although Syria is edging its way to being a relatively significant Mediterranean producer. A further increase in production by the mid-1990s cannot be ruled out. Further finds by Shell will determine this. As the May deadline approaches for Shell to relinquish its Ash Sham concession, the company has about ten drilling rigs working overtime to ensure there is no repeat of its recent painful experience when Elf Aquitaine of France made a commercial discovery in Shell's surrendered Deir ez Zawr acreage. Oil industry representatives say that there is some talk of an arrangement that might allow Shell to continue exploring in the Ash Sham concession beyond the May deadline, but at this stage Shell executives assume that they will be obliged to relinquish the acreage on the due date. Among other foreign players in the field, Occidental of the US is pushing ahead. Occidental has two years of a three-year exploration agreement to run on its 8,000 sq km block in central Syria. However, other companies, such as Repsol of Spain, which has also been exploring in central Syria, and Unocal (formerly Union Oil of California), which has been searching near the Turkish border, are reported to be drilling their last wells and are likely to join the exodus if they are not successful. Marathon has been sitting on a fairly sizeable gas find but at this stage there is no sign of it beginning commercial exploitation. Indeed, company representatives are reported to be 'not very enthusiastic'. Syria's domestic market is limited, although power stations are being converted to 'dual use' technology. Export prospects are not especially encouraging.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

By PAUL AMES, ASSOCIATED PRESS      LISBON, Portugal      After 15 years of an economically devastating civil war, oil-rich Angola may  find itself on the winning end of the conflict in the Persian Gulf.    The southwestern African nation derives 90% of its export earnings from oil  production, and experts say the recent run-up in crude prices on worldwide  markets could bring a windfall in profits.    The light crude from Angola's oil-producing center in Cabinda province already  has risen to as much as $32 a 42-gallon barrel since the Aug. 2 invasion of  Kuwait by neighboring Iraq. That was $17 higher than the April average.    It's a welcome relief for Angola, which, like other oil-producing nations, had  to weather a soft oil market in the mid-1980s, when crude prices neared the  $10-a-barrel level.    ""The government needs oil revenues desperately,"" said Robert Connon, general  manager of Cabinda Gulf Oil Co., a unit of Chevron Corp., which operates rigs  off the Cabinda coast near Zaire.    Oil is what has kept the country going during the civil war between the Marxist  government and U.S.-backed UNITA rebels, who have been fighting for power since  Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.    Although much of Angola's land is fertile, little has been under cultivation  since the war. And exports of the country's large mineral deposits, including  diamonds and iron ore, have been virtually halted.    Angola currently pumps about 550,000 barrels of crude a day, up from a daily  output of 130,000 barrels in 1982, according to government figures. That's only  about one-tenth the oil of Saudi Arabia, but with crude reserves at 2.1 billion  barrels, Angola follows Nigeria as sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil  producer.    Oil industry experts estimate that Angola's crude oil exports earned $2.5  billion last year, up from an estimated $1.9 billion in 1985.    The United States is the largest buyer of Angolan oil even though it spends  more than $50 million a year in arming UNITA, which stands for the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola. U.S. imports of Angolan oil totaled  42.7 million barrels from January through May, according to the U.S. Energy  Information Administration.    Angola is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,  but it often follows moves by the cartel to cut or raise production. It's  unlikely, though, that Angola will boost production any time soon to make up  for a shortage of supplies stemming from the Iraqi invasion and subsequent U.S.  troop buildup in the region, representatives of the big foreign oil companies  said. They said Angola oil production already is operating near capacity.    ""Our fields in Angola, and from what we understand, the other fields as well  are producing pretty much flat out,"" said Bill Rapp, Texaco Inc.'s West African  and Latin American area coordinator.

Like many other mining projects in the former Soviet Union, this venture involves a small western company - British  Commonwealth Minerals. It has 49 per cent and operating control of the joint venture that has won the rights to an area in the Central Asian nation's Zeravshan Valley containing two mines, both fully-developed, a treatment plant and proven and probable gold reserves estimated at 16m ounces (497 tonnes). The Tajikistan government, which owns the rest of the joint venture, is contributing the exploration rights and about Dollars 500m worth of infrastructure and mining equipment, much of it new, remaining after the former Soviet Union collapsed three years ago. European and Canadian investors last month provided USDollars 40m towards the venture. This was raised by London broker T. Hoare for Nelson Trade  Finance, a Toronto-quoted company that once financed the controversial Hollywood movie, 9 1/2 Weeks. This financing scheme resulted in Nelson, which previously owned 25 per cent of CBM, taking full control. Mr Richard Northcott, chairman of Nelson, said that after costs and payments to the estate of Mr Cameron Glover, who set up CBM and died recently in an air accident in Argentina, about Dollars 30m was available for the Tajik venture. Mr Northcott said that, when more equity funding was needed, Nelson would consider applying for a London stock exchange quotation. In the meantime, both the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank offshoot, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development had been approached to provide debt capital. The joint venture seems likely to be followed by a spate of other mineral deals involving western companies in Central Asia, whose five republics are estimated to contain well over half the former Soviet Union's minerals wealth. Tajikistan itself not only offers gold but has large deposits of silver, antimony and boron. Mineral specialists ask a number of questions about working in Central Asia, issues faced by a multitude of western energy groups that have established local offices. The main issue will probably be political risk - will cash-poor nations like Tajikistan ultimately allow their mineral wealth to be exported, and, if they don't, will they have the money to develop it themselves? A second question is whether Russia, which has been blocking the region from exporting its natural gas and oil, will allow Central Asia to develop its natural wealth independently. Western officials in Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, tend to give the Tajik government the benefit of the doubt, but stress that it is too early to be sure. 'You can cut a deal with this government. Whether they honour it is another question,' said one western analyst. 'They haven't really been put to the test yet.' Russia's reaction to all the new activity hasn't been gauged. Yet the deals are piling up, both in Tajikistan and the rest of the region. Only this week, the UK company Gold  Minerals Excavation signed a gold exploration deal for Tajikistan's southern Darwaz region. Canada's Gulf Minerals is looking into a tailings project in the same area, according to Mr Giorgi Kashlakov, a senior economic adviser to the prime minister. Lonrho, the international mining and trading group, meanwhile, after losing out on the Zeravshan mining project, is considering a large antimony-gold deposit in central Tajikistan near Iskanderkul Lake, Mr Kashlakov said. Outside Tajikistan, CBM itself is negotiating to develop gold deposits in the neighbouring Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan. These are in addition to previous gold deals announced by Canada's Cameco in the Kyrgyz Republic, Newmont of the US in Uzbekistan, and a venture involving London Stock Exchange-listed Bakyrchik Gold in Kazakhstan. CBM's success in Tajikistan so far appears attributable to long-cultivated contacts in Tajikistan's extremely complex political sphere. CBM has had an advantage because Mr Richard Wilkins, commercial director of the joint venture company, Zeravshan Gold, has been developing close relationships with both sides in Tajikistan's civil war since 1991. Mr Wilkins is confident that the political risk for CBM is low, and that the company will be able either to ship its gold to market, or sell it to the Tajikistan government for dollars at world prices. 'My job is to keep up contacts with the government,' Mr Wilkins says. 'Even if they overturned the whole leadership and brought in the opposition, it wouldn't worry me.' CBM expects the joint venture to produce its first gold from the Jilau open pit mine where mining and processing is taking place only ten days a month because of lack of funds. By targetting some high grade ore, Jilau could be producing at an annual rate of 80,000 to 100,000 ounces by the end of 1995, suggests Mr Roger Turner, chairman of the joint venture company. More work would be needed at the Taror underground mining complex before production could begin in earnest in 1998, particularly on how the ore, which contains substantial quantities of arsenic, should be treated. Mr Turner pointed out that environmental clean-up was not a problem as the mines and plant were new. However, the joint venture would have to ensure that the mining town of 2,000 people - with its infrastructure of roads, power plant, water and sewage plants as well as a school and hospital - was kept supplied. At present there were shortages of some essentials, such as fuel for central heating. Meanwhile, Tajik Geology has been contracted by CBM to do Dollars 2m of exploration work a year in the Zeravshan Valley.   Companies:-  British and Commonwealth Minerals.

The vote set the stage for a Senate showdown on the vast drilling ban, which  has gained powerful momentum from outrage over the flurry of recent oil spills.  It is opposed by the Administration on grounds that it would hinder necessary  oil exploration.    Unprecedented in its scope, the drilling ban would put 84 million acres of the  nation's outer continental shelf -- including the entire California coast --  off limits to oil companies until at least October, 1990.    The plan, approved on a 374-49 vote as part of a measure providing $11.1  billion for the Interior Department, marked a momentous victory for those who  have counseled caution toward oil exploration in the aftermath of the spills.      Jeopardizes Watt Plan    The action puts in jeopardy much of the ambitious offshore drilling plan laid  out by former Interior Secretary James G. Watt nearly nine years ago and  supported by Republican administrations ever since. It also could render almost  powerless a White House task force appointed last February by President Bush in  hopes of restoring a national consensus on the controversial oil exploration  plans.    The ban, drafted by Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), vastly expands a  long-standing prohibition on new drilling off Southern and Northern California.  It adds Central California to the off-limits list for the first time and  imposes new one-year drilling bans off sensitive areas of the coasts of Alaska,  Florida and six Mid-Atlantic states.    In addition, it launches Congress' first attempt to roll back the territory  already claimed by drilling operations, requiring the Interior Department to  consider buying back a substantial tract of sea floor already leased to the oil  companies in Alaska's Bristol Bay for more than $95 million.    Although the drilling moratorium surmounted what had been expected to be a  major hurdle last week when it was easily approved by the House Appropriations  Committee, the Bush Administration had planned to ambush the effort when it  reached the full House.    But Administration officials said that they were forced to abandon that effort  after finding that support from traditional quarters had crumbled under the  weight of public opinion turned increasingly antagonistic to oil exploration. A  final blow was dealt by television images of a crippled Exxon Valdez trailing a  miles-long oil slick in the waters off San Diego Bay on Tuesday night, the  officials said.    As a result, the House debate on the moratorium -- a prolonged and contentious  fight when the issue has been discussed in previous years -- Wednesday bore the  unmistakable aura of a fait accompli as the Republican congressman leading the  opposition to the drilling ban yielded much of his time to colleagues  supportive of the measure.      No Separate Vote    No attempts were made to delete the drilling ban from the legislation, and no  separate vote was taken on the issue.    The easy victory for the drilling moratorium in the House shifted the locus to  the Senate, where Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) vowed to lead the campaign for a  drilling ban over what Administration officials characterized as a long-shot  effort to halt it.    While the Senate previously has exhibited hostility to anti-oil efforts, an  aide to Wilson said that the senator believes public sentiment has swung  against drilling to such a marked extent that the moratorium should win  decisive approval.    A presidential veto of the drilling ban would be out of the question because of  the importance of the spending bill to which it is attached, White House  officials said.    The specter of oil spills hovered over much of the House discussion Wednesday,  as proponents of the drilling ban warned of the dangers of undertaking new  risks in oil exploration while Administration allies touted the demonstrated  safety of offshore oil.    Panetta, whose bill covers an area 100 times greater than the first moratorium  he authored in 1981, described the sweeping House action as reflective of  ""growing public concern and anger over the failed promises that oil spills can  be contained.""    But his chief adversary on the issue, Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio), warned that  the provision would leave the United States ever more dependent on foreign oil  and ""headed down the same road"" that led to the devastating gasoline lines and  energy crises of the 1970s.    And another powerful advocate of oil interests, Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.)  adopted the rallying cry of earlier contentious energy fights when he said of  oil moratorium advocates: ""Let 'em freeze in the dark!""    If finally enacted, the moratorium would severely limit the influence of the  White House task force appointed by Bush to advise him on whether drilling  should proceed in controversial Lease Sale 91 off Northern California and Lease  Sale 95 off Southern California, and in another area off Florida's Gulf Coast.    The task force has been instructed to make recommendations to Bush by the end  of the year. Under the moratorium, however, the department would be unable to  act until October, 1990, leaving Congress time to challenge any  Administration-backed drilling plans that it still might find unacceptable.    The moratorium approved by Congress likely would delay any new federal drilling  activity off California well beyond the autumn of 1990 because it includes  added protection barring the government from beginning even prelease activity.    That provision most likely would affect Lease Sale 119, a massive tract off  Central California, where the auction of drilling rights almost certainly would  be stalled until 1992.    The $11.1-billion Interior appropriations bill includes some $220 million more  than the Administration had requested, largely because of additional spending  on national parks approved after a procession of 350 congressmen appeared  before a House committee to request special grants for parks in their areas.

The vote set the stage for a Senate showdown on the vast drilling ban, which  has gained powerful momentum from outrage over the flurry of recent oil spills.  It is opposed by the Administration on grounds that it would hinder necessary  oil exploration.    Unprecedented in its scope, the drilling ban would put 84 million acres of the  nation's outer continental shelf -- including the entire California coast --  off limits to oil companies until at least October, 1990.    The plan, approved on a 374-49 vote as part of a measure providing $11.1  billion for the Interior Department, marked a momentous victory for those who  have counseled caution toward oil exploration in the aftermath of the spills.      Jeopardizes Watt Plan    The action puts in jeopardy much of the ambitious offshore drilling plan laid  out by former Interior Secretary James G. Watt nearly nine years ago and  supported by Republican administrations ever since. It also could render almost  powerless a White House task force appointed last February by President Bush in  hopes of restoring a national consensus on the controversial oil exploration  plans.    The ban, drafted by Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), vastly expands a  long-standing prohibition on new drilling off Southern and Northern California.

0,FT922-8798 ,"FT922-8798 _AN-CELA7AAMFT 920512   FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (11): Key to Angola's survival since independence - The oil industry      By CAROLINE SOUTHEY   ANGOLA'S oil industry, largely protected from the vagaries of civil war and political uncertainty, has boomed during the past four years and the success story seems likely to continue for the rest of this decade. Oil has been the key to Angola's survival since independence - the sole underwriter of the war effort and guarantor of its international debts. Within 25 years, Angola has become sub-Sahara's largest producer after Nigeria, with the region's second-biggest reserve base. Recoverable reserve estimates over the next five years for fields in production, under development and those being lined up totals some 4.9bn barrels. Although the oil industry survived the turmoil of independence better than any other sector of the economy, production began to flag in the late 1970s, leading to a reorganisation of the sector between 1976 and 1979. The changes, which included the establishment of Sonangol as the government's business arm responsible for co-ordinating and controlling petroleum activities, resulted in a steady rise in production from 1982. Factors which attracted foreign companies to Angola 10 years ago - low operating costs, prospects for new discoveries and favourable contractual terms offered by Sonangol - are still drawing new investment into the sector. A further attraction is that Angola has never been a member of Opec. This has allowed it flexibility to sell what crude it can produce. Mr Joaquim David, director-general of Sonangol, the state-owned oil company, says with some pride: 'The companies that began with us in the initial years have stayed and new ones have been drawn in.' Peace for the country has coincided with record exploration levels and the discovery of lucrative deep-water wells. Sonangol in turn has begun to offer an innovative licensing regime which is proving highly attractive to foreign companies. Under the regime - known as a 'rate of return' profit oil - the percentage of production left to the investing company varies according to the field's level of productivity. Mr David is optimistic. 'Oil is a growing industry. Our production is five times what it was in the last years of the the Portuguese administration. We have every reason to believe upstream development will grow.' The importance of the sector cannot be over-estimated. Oil accounts for more than 90 per cent of total export earnings. Last year, crude oil exports earned Angola some Dollars 3.15bn compared with Dollars 3.55bn in 1990. The highest level ever of exploration activity in the offshore sector last year is set to assure oil's paramount role in the Angolan economy. A surge of development is now anticipated which should boost output from its 1991 level of 505,000 b/d to 680,000 b/d in 1996. Of the current output of 555,000 b/d, Chevron accounts for 300,000 b/d, Elf 165,000 b/d, Texaco 55,000 b/d, Belgium's Petrofina 30,000 b/d and Italy's Agip 5,000 b/d. In tandem, offshore operators have prepared extensive expansion plans. County NatWest WoodMac, in a report on the the West African oil industry drawn up early this year, estimates that expenditure in Angola will peak in 1993 and 1994 at Dollars 750m each year. Capital investment has grown rapidly over the past 3 years, from Dollars 210m in 1988 to about Dollars 500m in 1991. This compares with a previous high of Dollars 532m (1992 prices) in 1987. Mr Matthew Shaw of County NatWest Woodmac predicts that over the next nine years some Dollars 4.7bn of upstream investment is envisaged, compared with Dollars 3.3bn spent over the past nine years. Those expected to make the biggest commitments are Chevron in Cabinda, Texaco in Block 2 and Elf in Block 3. 'Chevron has a high degree of commitment to our Angola operation. In international terms it is one of the big five. In investment terms it will be at the top during the next three years. After 1995 it should be the biggest in liquid production,' says Mr Bob Connon, managing director of Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (Cabgoc). Cabgoc, in association with Sonangol, Elf Petroleum Angola, and AGIP Angola, operates the offshore concession of Cabinda. Area A of this concession is presently producing 310,000 b/d. The production sharing agreement (PSA) gives Sonangol 41 per cent, Cabgoc 39.2 per cent, Elf 10 per cent and AGIP 9.8 per cent. There is no production yet from the deep-water Areas B and C of the Cabinda concession. However, a three-year contract for the first phase is due to be signed shortly with Setal of Brazil and Lummis of Sweden. The contract covers the structures, treating and pumping equipment and the pipeline to shore. The complete development of the project up to first production, including this contract, is worth more than Dollars 400m. The cost is explained because of the expense of drilling in deeper water of about 350ft. The maximum water depth of current production is slightly over 200ft. The first oil is expected to flow in 1994. Peak production could reach an estimated 100,000 b/d. Mr Connon says the development is comparable to 'three large events in our history in Angola since we started in in 1954.' These included the development of Takula field in 1982, the introduction of waterflooding at Takula and the first development in the Malongo field. Onshore, where activity was effectively stalled by the civil war, drilling is set to be resumed within the next couple of years. In the Cabinda enclave, an area that has not been drilled since Cabgoc relinquished its concession in 1971, BP and Occidental are due to sign new contracts although the first well is not expected until 1994. On the mainland, where the war severely disrupted work, exploration work could resume. Some exploration acreage is already licensed to Fina and in the longer term new areas could be licensed although this is not expected until the end of the decade.

SHORES;    ECOLOGY: NEARLY SEVEN OUT OF 10 RESIDENTS FAVOR A COMPLETE BAN IN LOCAL WATERS,  BUT HALF SAY THEY FAVOR MORE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ELSEWHERE.      By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER      As President Bush ponders the future of offshore oil drilling in Southern  California, the message from Orange County residents who suffered the effects  of a major spill just two months ago rings loud and clear: no new oil platforms  in our back yard.    The recent Huntington Beach spill, which dumped 394,000 gallons of Alaskan  crude oil into local waters, fouled 20 miles of shoreline, killed hundreds of  marine birds and has left a lasting impression on many county residents, a  Times Orange County Poll on the environment has found. The accident has also  fueled concerns about the safety of oil drilling and shipping in general,  particularly off the Orange County coast.    ""What happened really scared me,"" said Mary MacDonald, 65, a retired  schoolteacher in San Juan Capistrano who participated in the poll. ""I'd rather  be producing our own oil than buying it from foreign countries, but we need to  be careful about what we're doing.""    Eight in 10 residents believe the Feb. 7 tanker spill caused significant  environmental damage and dealt a blow to the beach economy, according to the  poll conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates. Despite officials'  pronouncements that the spill caused no lasting harm, one in four in the poll  described the damage as ""major.""    Two out of three Orange County residents are more concerned about oil shipping  and drilling than they were before the Huntington Beach spill, according to the  poll, while eight in 10 worry that history will repeat itself with another  large spill off the Orange County coast.    ""I know the Huntington Beach oil spill had to do with shipping oil and not  drilling, but the thing is, if those platforms are right out there, the chance  of having another spill or something going wrong offshore is a lot higher,""  said Dawna Brady, 18, a receptionist in San Clemente. ""I drive up the coast,  see them (oil platforms) and wonder, 'now what's going to happen with those?' ""    Pollster Baldassare said the results show that opposition to oil drilling  appears to have reached a ""high-water mark.""    ""It's partly because of the spill off the coast of Huntington Beach,"" he said.  ""But there also appears to be a growing consensus that offshore oil drilling,  at least off the coast of Orange County, may not be worth the environmental  hazards.""    That sentiment is reflected by the 66% of county residents who favor a complete  ban on drilling off the Orange County coast, compared to 25% who support more  drilling and 9% who are undecided. That does not translate into support for a  ban on oil drilling elsewhere in the nation, however. Half say they favor  increasing oil exploration and production elsewhere in the United States, and  only 38% oppose it.    Don Gardner, 41, a hardware store owner in Stanton, called a local ban the  ""first step in being environmentally responsible."" He said he fears that an oil  spill ""10 times the size"" of the Huntington Beach spill could occur if federal  officials allow full-scale oil and gas exploration in local waters.    Not all county residents, however, agree that a permanent ban is the answer.  Todd Mathewson, 29, an industrial equipment salesman from Fullerton, said such  a move would ""seal off"" a crucial option for meeting rising fuel demands.    He said he believes offshore energy development should be a last resort.  However, should the availability of oil become scarce, Mathewson said, he would  support drilling off the county's coast.    ""I would prefer drilling on land first, but you can't be foolish enough to say  'never' to offshore drilling,"" Mathewson said.    Despite the threat of oil spills, some residents such as Roy Ballard, 73, of  Placentia, believe drilling is a necessary evil -- the price society pays for  its addiction to oil.    ""What are we going to do? Give up our cars, our electricity, our microwave  ovens?"" Ballard asked. ""If we need that oil, let's drill for it.""    For the moment, a local ban will remain in effect off the Orange County coast  pending a decision from President Bush about whether to open up more of  Southern California to offshore drilling. Shortly after taking office, Bush  temporarily stopped lease-sale preparations begun during the Reagan  Administration and ordered a task force to assess the environmental and  economic impact of several proposed lease sales in California and Florida.    Lease Sale 95, proposed off the Southern California coast, includes 6.7 million  acres extending from the Mexican border to the northern border of San Luis  Obispo County. The presidential task force has laid out a series of options for  each of the lease sales, ranging from allowing leasing to extending the current  ban. Bush is expected to announce his decision sometime this summer.    For the most part, there is little debate on the matter among Orange County  residents whose memories of the Huntington Beach spill are still fresh. The  President, they say, should allow more drilling -- but elsewhere.    ""I guess that's because I want it out of my back yard,"" said Ann DePriest, 40,  of Garden Grove.

SHORES;    ECOLOGY: NEARLY SEVEN OUT OF 10 RESIDENTS FAVOR A COMPLETE BAN IN LOCAL WATERS,  BUT HALF SAY THEY FAVOR MORE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ELSEWHERE.      By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER      As President Bush ponders the future of offshore oil drilling in Southern  California, the message from Orange County residents who suffered the effects  of a major spill just two months ago rings loud and clear: no new oil platforms  in our back yard.    The recent Huntington Beach spill, which dumped 394,000 gallons of Alaskan  crude oil into local waters, fouled 20 miles of shoreline, killed hundreds of  marine birds and has left a lasting impression on many county residents, a  Times Orange County Poll on the environment has found. The accident has also  fueled concerns about the safety of oil drilling and shipping in general,  particularly off the Orange County coast.    ""What happened really scared me,"" said Mary MacDonald, 65, a retired  schoolteacher in San Juan Capistrano who participated in the poll. ""I'd rather  be producing our own oil than buying it from foreign countries, but we need to  be careful about what we're doing.""    Eight in 10 residents believe the Feb. 7 tanker spill caused significant  environmental damage and dealt a blow to the beach economy, according to the  poll conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates. Despite officials'  pronouncements that the spill caused no lasting harm, one in four in the poll  described the damage as ""major.""    Two out of three Orange County residents are more concerned about oil shipping  and drilling than they were before the Huntington Beach spill, according to the  poll, while eight in 10 worry that history will repeat itself with another  large spill off the Orange County coast.    ""I know the Huntington Beach oil spill had to do with shipping oil and not  drilling, but the thing is, if those platforms are right out there, the chance  of having another spill or something going wrong offshore is a lot higher,""  said Dawna Brady, 18, a receptionist in San Clemente. ""I drive up the coast,  see them (oil platforms) and wonder, 'now what's going to happen with those?' ""    Pollster Baldassare said the results show that opposition to oil drilling  appears to have reached a ""high-water mark.""    ""It's partly because of the spill off the coast of Huntington Beach,"" he said.  ""But there also appears to be a growing consensus that offshore oil drilling,  at least off the coast of Orange County, may not be worth the environmental  hazards.""    That sentiment is reflected by the 66% of county residents who favor a complete  ban on drilling off the Orange County coast, compared to 25% who support more  drilling and 9% who are undecided. That does not translate into support for a  ban on oil drilling elsewhere in the nation, however. Half say they favor  increasing oil exploration and production elsewhere in the United States, and  only 38% oppose it.    Don Gardner, 41, a hardware store owner in Stanton, called a local ban the  ""first step in being environmentally responsible."" He said he fears that an oil  spill ""10 times the size"" of the Huntington Beach spill could occur if federal  officials allow full-scale oil and gas exploration in local waters.    Not all county residents, however, agree that a permanent ban is the answer.  Todd Mathewson, 29, an industrial equipment salesman from Fullerton, said such  a move would ""seal off"" a crucial option for meeting rising fuel demands.    He said he believes offshore energy development should be a last resort.  However, should the availability of oil become scarce, Mathewson said, he would  support drilling off the county's coast.    ""I would prefer drilling on land first, but you can't be foolish enough to say  'never' to offshore drilling,"" Mathewson said.    Despite the threat of oil spills, some residents such as Roy Ballard, 73, of  Placentia, believe drilling is a necessary evil -- the price society pays for  its addiction to oil.    ""What are we going to do? Give up our cars, our electricity, our microwave  ovens?"" Ballard asked. ""If we need that oil, let's drill for it.""    For the moment, a local ban will remain in effect off the Orange County coast  pending a decision from President Bush about whether to open up more of  Southern California to offshore drilling. Shortly after taking office, Bush  temporarily stopped lease-sale preparations begun during the Reagan  Administration and ordered a task force to assess the environmental and  economic impact of several proposed lease sales in California and Florida.    Lease Sale 95, proposed off the Southern California coast, includes 6.7 million  acres extending from the Mexican border to the northern border of San Luis  Obispo County. The presidential task force has laid out a series of options for  each of the lease sales, ranging from allowing leasing to extending the current  ban. Bush is expected to announce his decision sometime this summer.    For the most part, there is little debate on the matter among Orange County  residents whose memories of the Huntington Beach spill are still fresh. The  President, they say, should allow more drilling -- but elsewhere.    ""I guess that's because I want it out of my back yard,"" said Ann DePriest, 40,  of Garden Grove. ""I know there is oil in other places and we ought to try as  many of them as possible.""    Staff writer Steven R. Churm contributed to this story.

0,FT932-8571 ,"FT932-8571 _AN-DERDAAF8FT 930518   FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China appears ready to remove barriers against foreign miners      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   AFTER YEARS of procrastination, China at last appears willing to begin dismantling nationalistic barriers against foreign involvement in its mining sector, including gold prospects. Participants in a conference held in Beijing last week, among them representatives of some of the world's biggest mining houses, came away convinced that change was in the wind; although it was unclear how quickly China would replace existing legislation. Mining company representatives, used to sterile discussion on the need for liberalisation, were surprised when, on the eve of the conference, Chinese officials, responding to international pressure, halved the rate of gold royalties in draft legislation. While the proposed 10 per cent royalty rate is still outrageously high by international standards, especially compared with those in developing countries where rates of between 2 and 3 per cent apply, apparent Chinese flexibility was regarded as a good sign. Chinese regulations at present ban foreign companies from involvement in the exploitation of gold reserves, but China is anxious to secure capital and perhaps more important the advanced minerals treatment technology required to exploit this lucrative area. Mr Graham Reid, a senior manager of CRA of Australia, said that although the Chinese had a 'fair way to go' in their efforts to attract foreign miners, he had found attitudes displayed by officials of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources 'very encouraging'. He noted that Chinese officials responded with alacrity to suggestions by the foreign participants, who included representative of Newmont Mining of the US, Cominco of Canada, De Beers of South Africa, and BHP of Australia; although he also observed that substantial change to legislation would require the approval of the Chinese parliament. Among the more positive developments was a Chinese undertaking to study a proposal that the country should adopt a model 'contract of work' allowing prospective mining ventures to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, thus facilitating much greater flexibility. Mr Reid, CRA's general manager for exploration, noted that this approach was operating successfully in parts of Africa and in Indonesia  - a contract of work's main appeal is that it overrides existing laws - where it had proved an effective means of 'kick starting' mining exploration and development. Chinese mining officials have made it clear that they are under pressure to boost activity in the mining sector, which is lagging far behind the rest of the economy. China's economic boom has heightened demand for a whole range of minerals, both ferrous and non-ferrous. Mr Reid said that foreign miners would, however, proceed cautiously and would want to be sure that any new mining regulations were consistent with domestic laws. 'Western mining companies like laws that are drafted with particularity and clarity,' he observed. Western miners were also likely to insist that disputes be settled by international arbitration and not within the Chinese system. This was a concept that was fairly alien to the Chinese. Foreign mining representatives also pressed the Chinese last week on the need to make available larger areas for exploration, but at the same time urged regulations that would oblige exploration companies to surrender prospective areas that were not being exploited, thus ensuring 'turnover'. Other issues that preoccupied the conference, jointly organised by the United Nations, included access to foreign exchange, and guaranteed unlimited rights to export product. The Chinese were also pressed to clarify a tax regime that might apply to new mining ventures   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P1099 Metal Ores, NEC.     P1041 Gold Ores.

Demonstration That Recovered Oil Meets Conditions of Exclusion      Under 261.2(f), persons claiming that recovered oil is excluded from the definition of solid waste bear the burden of proof in enforcement actions to demonstrate that they qualify for the exclusion. This would normally require some type of demonstration that the recovered oil is going to be and actually is used in a petroleum refining operation prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. For on-site sources, this documentation could be entries in the operating records of the facility showing where the oil is recovered and where it re-enters the refining process. For off-site sources, this demonstration is especially important. Adequate documentation could entail     bona fide     contractual agreements with other facilities to take the recovered oil, shipping or delivery records to the receiving facility, or other similar records. These records are important to show enforcement personnel that the conditions of the exclusion have been met. Without this documentation, the burden of proof will ordinarily not be satisfied because enforcement personnel will have no way of verifying that the recovered oil actually was used in the refining process and the assumption can be made that the oil was not reused, and was instead sent off-site or managed on-site as a hazardous waste.      IX. Examples of How Today's Rule Operates      Example 1      Petroleum refinery A generates wastewater. As part of primary wastewater treatment, it skims oil from the wastewater. This operation occurs in wastewater treatment tanks. The skimmed oil is then gathered and inserted directly into crude oil storage units for insertion into the refining process.  The refinery process wastewater is still considered to be a solid waste, notwithstanding that some oil is skimmed from it. The wastewater treatment tanks used for treating the wastewater are exempt from subtitle C regulation. Section 264.1(g)(6), 265.1(c)(10). The skimmed oil is recovered oil that is excluded from being a solid waste under today's regulation because it originates from petroleum refining, it is not land disposed before being recycled, and it is returned to the designated part of the petroleum refining process. (This answer assumes that the recovered oil is not being accumulated speculatively.)      Example 2      Same facts as Example 1, except that the skimmed oil requires processing in the plant's slop oil system. This process involves demulsifying and separation via chemical addition, thermal treatment, and gravity separation.  Same answer as in Example 1. It should also be noted that water and solids from the slop oil system can be wastes, and if hazardous, can be subject to Subtitle C regulation once they are removed from the slop oil tank.      Example 3        Same facts as Example 1, except that the source of the recovered oil is a petrochemical plant wastewater treatment system.  The oil is not excluded from being a solid waste under today's rule because it does not come from petroleum refining, exploration or production operations.        Example 4        Facility B recovers oil from spills at exploration and production operations. The oil is trucked to a tank, where separation occurs. The separated oil is put into a pipeline for ultimate insertion into crude oil storage units at a petroleum refinery.    The oil recovered from the spills is excluded from being a solid waste. It is a type of recovered oil, and is excluded because it originates from exploration and production activities, is not land disposed or accumulated speculatively, and is inserted into a refining process.        Example 5        Facility C is a bulk petroleum storage facility. Oil spilled from its product storage tanks is too contaminated to be directly used as product. The oil is sent back to a refinery where it is placed in a slop oil system and returned to the refining process.  The spilled oil is excluded from being a solid waste, not under today's rule, but under 261.33 (and 261.2 Table 1) because it is a commercial chemical product that is being recycled rather than abandoned. (EPA interprets this principle to apply to commercial chemical products that exhibit characteristics as well as those listed in 261.33. 50 FR 14219 (April 11, 1985).) (This answer assumes that the oil is recovered promptly and that the spills do not create permanent land disposal units. See 55 FR 22671 (June 1, 1990).)  All of these answers assume that legitimate recycling is occurring.

Figures show that the company's reserve replacement ratio for oil and gas was more than 125 per cent. Finding costs fell to Dollars 3.51 (Pounds 2.40) per barrel of oil equivalent, compared with Dollars 4.41 in 1992. Anything under Dollars 4 is considered good, according to analysts. Revisions to existing reserves helped to boost the reserve replacement figure. Such revisions are often made after new production fields are brought on stream. The good finding cost figure reflects, in part, the cost controls which have been imposed in BP's exploration and production division, according to Mr Jeremy Hudson, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.

There are whispers in the international gold industry that the island may contain commercially exploitable deposits. In the past six months government officials have spoken with more than passing confidence of the impending opening of a mine. Companies involved in exploration in the island are not yet so sure. Orvana Minerals of Vancouver, Canada, reported that an exploration study had confirmed the existence of a 3.3 kilometre-long mineralised zone with between 2m and 6m tonnes of gold bearing ore in Jamaica's central interior region. Orvana bought the concession from BHP Minerals, the Australian-US miner, but later concluded that the mineralised area did not contain a commercially exploitable deposit, and that further exploration is needed. While awaiting conclusion of these studies, the island's mining sector is preoccupied with the impact on the bauxite industry of the soft aluminium market. Flooding of the market by the Russian Republic, which has depressed prices for the metal, has limited growth in mining and refining. As in other countries, the industry also fears an adverse impact from the US decision to reduce its strategic stockpile by selling relatively small quantities at prices about one third of those being asked by the ore producers. The effects on the industry of weak international demand are becoming painfully clear. Bauxite ore production last year was 11.2m tonnes, 0.7 per cent less than 1992, while exports of crude bauxite of 4m tonnes were 1.4 per cent less than in 1992, according to the Jamaica Bauxite Institute. 'The absence of strong growth in local output is a clear indication of the overall weak position of the world aluminium industry which is suffering from a supply demand imbalance and depressed prices,' says Mr Parris Lyew-Ayee, acting managing director of the institute. He adds: 'Jamaica's bauxite and alumina production, and earnings from the industry, reflect also a high level of output of primary aluminium in all the producing countries, especially by the members of the former Soviet Union, and the reluctance of producers to curtail production to correct the oversupply.' The economy is feeling the effects in a decline in the industry's earnings. These fell to Dollars 529m last year, down 8.3 per cent on the 1992 earnings, and about Dollars 200m less than in 1991. Under agreements with miners and refiners operating in the island, earnings from bauxite and alumina are pegged to the international prices for aluminium. Earnings have also been depressed by a steady depreciation of the Jamaican dollar, with mining and refining companies spending less to meet local costs. Conventional wisdom holds that the industry is going through another of its cycles of slump and recovery, and that prices and demand will harden when the market stabilises, but there is increasing concern in the industry that it could suffer longer term if miners and refiners are forced to reconsider a Dollars 500m investment programme planned for the next seven years. As the world's third largest producer of bauxite ore, after Australia and Guinea, Jamaica has proven reserves which will last 200 years at current rates of recovery. Much is to be gained economically by getting out and selling as much of the ore as possible. According to Mr Carlton Davis, chairman of the Bauxite Institute, there is a conscious attempt to export less and refine more, allowing the economy to benefit from the value added in refining. 'The current state of the market might lead some companies to reconsider their capital programmes, but in times like these one prepares to meet an upturn in the market.' The aim of the Jamaican industry is to lift refinery capacity to 5m tonnes per year by the year 2000. The Jamalco refinery in central Jamaica, owned jointly by the island's government and the Aluminum Company of America, is being expanded to a rated capacity of 1m tonnes per year at a cost of about Dollars 60m. The refinery is producing 700,000 tonnes per year, but there are already plans of further expansion which could lift its capacity to 2m tonnes per year. Alumina Partners of Jamaica, owned by Kaiser of the US and Hydro Aluminum of Norway, is spending Dollars 200m to increase the output from the island's largest refinery to 1.5m tonnes per year - and then to 2m tonnes by the turn of the century. Two refineries operated by Alcan of Canada, with a combined capacity of 1.1m tonnes per year, are being refurbished to lift output to 1.5m tonnes. Mr Davis says that the plants could be further expanded to produce 2m tonnes per year, using a grade of ore which was not yet being processed by the company. While there is optimism that the state of the industry will not adversely affect these expansion plans, two ventures have been reconsidered. The governments of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago had been discussing the construction of an aluminium smelter in Trinidad, using a 'modular' system, starting with a small plant and enlarging in stages to meet market demand. Both governments were considering starting with a 'module' of 55,000 tonnes per year. This project is not now being given priority because of the state of the market, and uncertainty over the cost of the local natural gas which would fuel the plant. The industry's plans also included the construction of a caustic soda plant to reduce the reliance on imports to meet part of the demand for 300,000 tonnes per year for the refineries. The project for a 50,000 tonnes per year plant has been set back, Mr Davis says, because of a significant drop in world prices of caustic soda. But there seems to be sufficient confidence in the industry that the recovery will come, and that when it does, Jamaica should be ready to take advantage of firmer prices and new markets.

'We hope to increase the amount of hydrocarbons under control of APPA (African Petroleum Producers Association),' he said at a meeting of the 11-member association in the Ivory Coast capital. Association officials said it did not envisage creating its own oil output quota system but tried to tailor output along the general lines of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries policy. 'We support the efforts of Opec in stabilising the market,' said Mr Mohamed Souidi, the executive secretary. Mr Aminu, the current Opec president, said that in a buyers market it was that much more difficult for African oil producers to spend on exploration to boost market share above the 10 per cent they now control.

MAUGH II, Times Science Writer      Results of new experiments conducted in the Antarctic last October during the  austral spring appear to confirm fears that the large ""hole"" in the ozone layer  caused by man-made chlorofluorocarbons may produce permanent damage to the  fragile ecosystem, the National Science Foundation said in a statement to be  released today.    The first accurate measurements of biologically damaging ultraviolet radiation  at the Earth's surface in Antarctica showed that levels were twice as high as  is normal in the springtime.    Calculations based on the new measurements also suggested that levels of the  damaging radiation were higher still -- about five times normal -- in October,  1987, when ozone depletion over the Antarctic was the greatest ever recorded,  according to geophysicist John E. Frederick of the University of Chicago.    In a separate study also released by the foundation, oceanographer Osmund  Helm-Hansen of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found that  photosynthetic activity of microscopic plants called phytoplankton was reduced  by about 25% in the upper three feet of the Antarctic Ocean in October as a  result of the increased radiation.    ""Phytoplankton, by virtue of photosynthesis, furnish all the food materials  which supply the needs of all the animals in the Antarctic Ocean,"" Helm-Hansen  said. ""So if the rate of photosynthesis is significantly affected, it would  affect the amount of food available for krill, fish, penguins and other  animals.""    Ted DeLaca, head of polar programs at the National Science Foundation, called  Helm-Hansen's results ""provocative,"" but cautioned that the biological impact  of ultraviolet radiation is very complex and will require a great deal of  further study.    The two experiments are part of a continuing probe of the biological effects of  increased ultraviolet radiation in the Antarctic sponsored by the foundation.  Scientists hope the research will shed light on the eventual effects of  increased ultraviolet radiation throughout the world caused by degradation of  the ozone layer, which shields the Earth from most of the sun's ultraviolet  radiation.    Scientists believe that the Earth's ozone layer has already been depleted by an  average of about 2.3% worldwide, and some project that the depletion will  exceed 10% early in the next century.    The Antarctic ozone hole, which covers an area the size of the United States,  is caused by the accumulation of chlorofluorocarbons in polar stratospheric  clouds during the long, dark Antarctic night. When the sun comes back above the  horizon in October, it triggers a massive destruction of ozone by the  chemicals.    The hole normally disappears in November or December, when it is dispersed by  winds.    Normally, ultraviolet radiation in the Antarctic begins at a low level in  spring and doubles in intensity in succeeding months, reaching a peak at the  summer solstice when the sun's rays shine most directly onto the Earth's  surface. Frederick and graduate student Dan Lubin found, however, that total  ultraviolet radiation in 1988 reached the summer level almost immediately after  the sun appeared in early October.    ""It's like the summertime radiation levels come early,"" Frederick said. Based  on their new measurements, he added, the researchers calculated that the spring  radiation level in 1987 was about 2 1/2 times as large as the summer peak.    Helm-Hansen and his colleagues collected phytoplankton at different depths of  the ocean, enclosed them in sealed bottles with radioactive carbon dioxide, and  lowered the bottles on tethers to the depth at which they were collected. They  recovered the bottles later and measured the amount of radioactive carbon  dioxide taken up by the phytoplankton, a direct measure of their photosynthetic  activity.    Some of the jars allowed all the sun's radiation to reach the enclosed  phytoplankton. Others blocked out all the damaging ultraviolet radiation, while  permitting entry of the visible light necessary for photosynthesis.    They found that phytoplankton exposed to the ultraviolet radiation in the top  three feet of the ocean carried out only 75% as much photosynthesis as those  shielded from it by the jars. Photosynthesis occurred at near normal rates at  greater depths because the water absorbed most of the ultraviolet radiation.    A decrease in photosynthetic rate means that the phytoplankton do not grow as  rapidly as normal, so that fewer of them are present to serve as food for  organisms higher in the food chain.    Both researchers will repeat their experiments in October, 1989, when the ozone  hole, which seems to operate on a two-year cycle governed by weather  conditions, is again expected to be severe.

The ships, which include the 'Ragno II', an oil exploration vessel owned by Italy's Saipem oil company, will enable experts to form a better impression of how much crude is left aboard the sunken Cypriot-registered supertanker 'Haven' and how best to remove it. Using remote-controlled cameras, experts will try to ascertain the wreck's condition. Decisions will then be taken on steps to remove the remaining oil. Surface efforts have so far recovered 6,000-7,000 tonnes of oil that had leaked from the vessel, which sank on Sunday. However, scientists estimated there could still be 100,000 tonnes of crude oil left in the ship and said this was a clear threat. Light winds were slowly blowing the oil south-west, towards France.

The action, which lifted the ban past its most formidable hurdle, marks a major  victory for those who have urged new caution toward oil exploration in the  aftermath of a series of major oil spills across the United States.    It would effectively give Congress new control over a number of controversial  offshore drilling plans, short-circuiting an aggressive effort by the Bush  Administration to forge a consensus on the issue and unshackle itself from  congressional limits.      Bitter Response    In a bitter response, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. assailed Congress for  ""shooting at the wrong target"" in failing to focus on the oil tankers held  responsible for recent spills. To demonstrate the Administration's outrage, he  announced plans to allow oil companies to begin drilling in a new 28  million-acre, oil-rich swath of the Gulf of Mexico.    The new congressional moratorium, approved on a voice vote by the House  Appropriations Committee as part of a larger package, would go far beyond an  existing drilling ban for Northern and Southern California, which has been  imposed each year since 1981.    The expanded ban would, for the first time, cover a proposed lease sale off  Central California and include vast regions in Alaska's Bristol Bay and off  several mid-Atlantic states. Also included in the ban are areas off southern  Florida and George's Bank, off Massachusetts.    In an unprecedented step, the moratorium would also afford California the added  protection of a ban even on pre-lease drilling activities, such as  environmental studies -- a step certain to cause delays in the Interior  Department's drilling timetable.    ""This is a critical victory at a critical time,"" said California Rep. Leon E.  Panetta (D-Monterey), sponsor of the drilling moratorium.    Another Californian, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), added, ""We have  effectively brought the entire sale process to a screeching halt.""    Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), a longtime opponent of offshore drilling, said  Thursday that he was ""ecstatic"" about the vote. ""This is the best victory we've  had in this seven-year fight,"" said Lowery, a member of the committee that  approved the moratorium.    Lowery said the six-vote margin of victory was significant because previous  committee votes regarding offshore drilling usually hinged on one or two votes.  The success was all the sweeter, Lowery said, because it represented the first  time pre-lease activity off the California coast has been restricted.    Lowery warned that Thursday's vote was only ""one more major skirmish in a long  battle."" The bill must still be approved by the full House, then by a  House-Senate conference committee.    Lowery and other opponents of offshore drilling said they believe that  worldwide coverage of recent oil spills may help persuade Congress that a  permanent ban on drilling in sensitive areas is needed. ""I've contended all  along the technology is not there for spills,"" Lowery said. ""Sadly, the Exxon  Valdez and events of recent weeks have proven me correct.""    Others warned, however, that to put vast areas of the U.S. coastline off limits  to offshore drilling represented a decision to cede control over U.S. energy to  foreign oil producers.    ""This says that the energy policy of the United States is to do nothing,""  warned Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio), the principal opponent of the measure.    Before becoming law, the moratorium must first be adopted by both the full  House and Senate. But officials on both sides of the drilling debate said they  expect the measure to be approved in light of the current climate of concern  over oil exploration and its hazards.      Opposes Measure    While the Administration strongly opposes the measure, it is regarded as  virtually veto-proof because it is included as an amendment to a vital  supplemental spending measure that President Bush would be unlikely to block.    If enacted, the moratorium would severely limit the influence of a White House  task force appointed by Bush to advise him on whether drilling should proceed  in controversial areas off Northern and Southern California and Florida's Gulf  Coast.    The task force, which has been seeking to strike a balance between the concerns  of environmentalists and the nation's energy needs, has been instructed to make  recommendations to Bush by the end of the year. Under the moratorium, however,  the department would be unable to act until October, 1990, leaving Congress  time to challenge any drilling plans that it still might find unacceptable.    ""The task force has, for the most part, become irrelevant,"" said Robert Hattoy,  the Sierra Club's Southern California regional director.    Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said the panel will continue its  work.    ""It's quite clear that Congress is trying to usurp the actions of the task  force, and we just don't believe that's correct or proper,"" he said.      Little Controversy    The new area put up for lease Thursday by the Interior Department lies off the  coasts of Texas and Louisiana. The proposed drilling there has generated little  controversy.    The heated debate over the drilling moratorium was made more ferocious by sharp  differences among legislators over the lessons that should be drawn from the  series of recent oil spills, including the damage caused in Alaska's Prince  William Sound by 10 million gallons of crude oil that leaked from the tanker  Exxon Valdez.    Environmentalists and anti-drilling forces have contended that the experience  should make lawmakers more cautious about all forms of oil exploration. While  drilling has resulted in few spills, they noted that much of the oil gathered  offshore must be transported to land by tankers.    But the Administration, the oil industry and their supporters countered that  new regulations ought to aim specifically at oil tankers.      Imports Grow    ""We understand that emotions are running high. . . ,"" the American Petroleum  Institute said in a statement. ""(But) the rash of tanker accidents does not  reflect on offshore drilling safety and does not change the fact that domestic  production of oil continues to fall while imports continue to grow.""    The dispute was focused most directly on the effort to include Alaska's Bristol  Bay in the new moratorium. The oil industry already has paid $95 million for  drilling rights in the region, but Alaskan officials demanded the protection in  the amendment out of concern that another spill could devastate the state's  economy.    Noting that years of environmental studies had deemed Bristol Bay safe for  drilling, Regula warned, ""If we can't drill here, we can't do it anywhere.""    But the committee, on a 29-22 vote, rebuffed his proposal to strip the region  from the package.    The special protection for the California coastline came under a provision  preventing the Interior Department from conducting pre-leasing activity along  the entire coast until October, 1990.      Survived Attack    The provision survived an attack by Rep. Lindy Boggs (D-La.), who noted that  the Interior Department needs up to 26 months to complete all of the steps  necessary to lease an offshore oil tract. The pre-lease ban thus could extend  the moratorium on drilling for up to two years, Boggs argued.    But a powerful coalition of Californians and others who voiced concern about  the recent oil spills defeated the Boggs amendment by a decisive 28-22 margin.    David Coggin, Washington chief of staff for Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside),  said, ""The majority of the delegation working on this really did a good job,  they really worked on getting those undecided or marginal votes to switch. Of  course, having three oil spills the week before didn't hurt.""    Because Lease Sale 95 -- off Carlsbad, Oceanside and Camp Pendleton -- and  Lease Sale 91 off Northern California have already been subjected to most  pre-lease steps, the additional postponement would most likely affect Lease  Sale 119, a massive portion of the Outer Continental Shelf off Central  California.    The Interior Department currently plans to begin oil exploration there in 1991.  If the pre-lease moratorium is imposed through 1990, however, the auction of  drilling rights for the Central California tract would almost certainly be  stalled until 1992.    That delay ""is very welcome news to Southern Californians,"" Levine said.    ""It says to the oil industries . . . that they would be much better off  dropping this fight,"" he said.    Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), a fervent anti-drilling advocate whose  district includes sensitive shoreline along Point Reyes and San Francisco, said  she is ""extremely pleased"" with the committee vote on the new moratorium.    Recent oil spills have evoked ""a real sentiment that we have to be  extraordinarily careful in the whole offshore oil drilling process,"" Boxer  said. Now, she said, Congress ""may well be ready"" for legislation that would  put areas permanently off limits to offshore drilling.

But officials on both sides of the drilling debate said they  expect the measure to be approved in light of the current climate of concern  over oil exploration and its hazards.      Opposes Measure    While the Administration strongly opposes the measure, it is regarded as  virtually veto-proof because it is included as an amendment to a vital  supplemental spending measure that President Bush would be unlikely to block.    If enacted, the moratorium would severely limit the influence of a White House  task force appointed by Bush to advise him on whether drilling should proceed  in controversial areas off Northern and Southern California and Florida's Gulf  Coast.    The task force, which has been seeking to strike a balance between the concerns  of environmentalists and the nation's energy needs, has been instructed to make  recommendations to Bush by the end of the year. Under the moratorium, however,  the department would be unable to act until October, 1990, leaving Congress  time to challenge any drilling plans that it still might find unacceptable.    ""The task force has, for the most part, become irrelevant,"" said Robert Hattoy,  the Sierra Club's Southern California regional director.    Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said the panel will continue its  work.    ""It's quite clear that Congress is trying to usurp the actions of the task  force, and we just don't believe that's correct or proper,"" he said.      Little Controversy    The new area put up for lease Thursday by the Interior Department lies off the  coasts of Texas and Louisiana. The proposed drilling there has generated little  controversy.    The heated debate over the drilling moratorium was made more ferocious by sharp  differences among legislators over the lessons that should be drawn from the  series of recent oil spills, including the damage caused in Alaska's Prince  William Sound by 10 million gallons of crude oil that leaked from the tanker  Exxon Valdez.    Environmentalists and anti-drilling forces have contended that the experience  should make lawmakers more cautious about all forms of oil exploration. While  drilling has resulted in few spills, they noted that much of the oil gathered  offshore must be transported to land by tankers.    But the Administration, the oil industry and their supporters countered that  new regulations ought to aim specifically at oil tankers.      Imports Grow    ""We understand that emotions are running high. . . ,"" the American Petroleum  Institute said in a statement. ""(But) the rash of tanker accidents does not  reflect on offshore drilling safety and does not change the fact that domestic  production of oil continues to fall while imports continue to grow.""    The dispute was focused most directly on the effort to include Alaska's Bristol  Bay in the new moratorium. The oil industry already has paid $95 million for  drilling rights in the region, but Alaskan officials demanded the protection in  the amendment out of concern that another spill could devastate the state's  economy.    Noting that years of environmental studies had deemed Bristol Bay safe for  drilling, Regula warned, ""If we can't drill here, we can't do it anywhere.""    But the committee, on a 29-22 vote, rebuffed his proposal to strip the region  from the package.    The special protection for the California coastline came under a provision  preventing the Interior Department from conducting pre-leasing activity along  the entire coast until October, 1990.      Survived Attack    The provision survived an attack by Rep. Lindy Boggs (D-La.), who noted that  the Interior Department needs up to 26 months to complete all of the steps  necessary to lease an offshore oil tract. The pre-lease ban thus could extend  the moratorium on drilling for up to two years, Boggs argued.    But a powerful coalition of Californians and others who voiced concern about  the recent oil spills defeated the Boggs amendment by a decisive 28-22 margin.    David Coggin, Washington chief of staff for Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside),  said, ""The majority of the delegation working on this really did a good job,  they really worked on getting those undecided or marginal votes to switch. Of  course, having three oil spills the week before didn't hurt.""    Because Lease Sale 95 -- off Carlsbad, Oceanside and Camp Pendleton -- and  Lease Sale 91 off Northern California have already been subjected to most  pre-lease steps, the additional postponement would most likely affect Lease  Sale 119, a massive portion of the Outer Continental Shelf off Central  California.    The Interior Department currently plans to begin oil exploration there in 1991.  If the pre-lease moratorium is imposed through 1990, however, the auction of  drilling rights for the Central California tract would almost certainly be  stalled until 1992.    That delay ""is very welcome news to Southern Californians,"" Levine said.    ""It says to the oil industries . . . that they would be much better off  dropping this fight,"" he said.    Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), a fervent anti-drilling advocate whose  district includes sensitive shoreline along Point Reyes and San Francisco, said  she is ""extremely pleased"" with the committee vote on the new moratorium.    Recent oil spills have evoked ""a real sentiment that we have to be  extraordinarily careful in the whole offshore oil drilling process,"" Boxer  said. Now, she said, Congress ""may well be ready"" for legislation that would  put areas permanently off limits to offshore drilling.      Full Run    "

For Argentina to take advantage of the Middle East crisis, Quijano said, it  needs a coherent oil development policy.    The administration of President Carlos S.

But Quijano contended that there now are too many policy conflicts among  Menem's ministers, and turf battles among the federal government and provincial  authorities, to entice foreign capital to participate in oil exploration and  production in Argentina.    Such participation is badly needed if the country is to increase its weak oil  output and expand the size of its reserves, both of which have declined since  1981.    The Argentine state oil company, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, includes in  its estimates a significant volume of oil reserves ""classified under the unique  concept termed 'conditional reserves' "" that are not recoverable under existing  economic conditions, the report said.

Projecting into the future, the World Bank estimates that Argentine crude oil  output could drop from about 165 million barrels in 1990 to 101 million in the  year 2000, a 39% loss.    Under the bank's ""minimum supply scenario,"" by the year 2010 crude oil  production would plunge to 30 million barrels a year and to 18 million barrels  by 2014.    Downstream from well production, the Argentine oil sector is hobbled by other  serious problems, the bank said.

A summary of that analysis was provided in the proposed rule (58 FR 45748). That analysis examined how designation of critical habitat was expected to affect the use of Federal lands or State or private activities with some Federal involvement, and the economic costs or benefits that would ensue in the four-State area. These were the regional economic effects of the designation that were over and above those expected to result from previous actions, including the listing of the desert tortoise as threatened. The economic analysis assumed those values that were in place prior to critical habitat (e.g., final Bureau of Land Management (BLM) plans, section 7 jeopardy standard, the Clark County short-term habitat conservation plan, and section 9 prohibitions) as the baseline for this analysis. As a result, critical habitat effects were those incremental impacts that would occur solely as a result of the critical habitat proposal above and beyond the effects of these other actions.    The critical habitat covers a broad geographic area in four States and includes Federal, State, private, and Tribal lands. Because the designation affects only Federal agency actions under section 7, it is assumed that any ensuing economic impacts of the designation would occur only on Federal lands or on non-Federal lands where there is Federal involvement. The Service concluded that the impacts on Federal lands would be largely limited to livestock grazing, mining, and recreational activities that may affect tortoise habitat.    As a result of that analysis, the Service concluded that the August 30 proposal would affect 51 Federal grazing permits that provide about 59,500 animal unit months (AUMs). The maximum potential reduction in regional employment was estimated to be 425 jobs (340 direct jobs; 85 indirect jobs). The profitability of ranches in the seven counties is estimated to fall by $4,470,000 due to critical habitat designation. That is the estimated permanent decrease in ranch profits, capitalized at 10 percent for a 50-year period, in accordance with the methodology of Rice     et al.     (1978). Reduced grazing fees in the seven-county region from Federal allotments was estimated to total $170,000 annually. Half of this amount ($85,000) was returned to the grazing programs for range improvements, the U.S. Treasury received a maximum 37.5 percent ($63,750) of the fees, and local governments received a minimum of 12.5 percent ($21,250). The effect of reduced grazing on Federal land is expected to vary among counties. The designation of critical habitat is not expected to have significant economic effects within any of the seven counties.    Designation of critical habitat will not affect ongoing mining operations, as the ground disturbances typical of mineral extraction make mine sites unsuitable for tortoise habitat. Expansion of existing mines or development of new mines will require section 7 consultation with the Service. Most of the CHUs include surface areas on which mining claims have been filed. The economic impact of critical habitat designation cannot be determined at the present time due to the uncertainty of economically feasible mineral extraction. Mining claims allow exploration but do not assure exercise of exploration rights, nor do they ensure economic profits to the owner.    The Service was unable to identify significant economic impacts to recreation activities due to critical habitat designation.    Conservation of the desert tortoise and its habitat through designation of critical habitat will result in a wide range of benefits, including recreation values, watershed protection, and others, as well as the values that society places on conservation of the tortoise and its ecosystem. However, it was not possible to place dollar estimates on these values.    As a result of this analysis, the Service concluded that the economic impacts that would be incurred from critical habitat designation would not be significant to either the regional (seven-county) or national economy. The Service did not recommend any exclusions based on economic effects.

Half of this amount ($85,000) was returned to the grazing programs for range improvements, the U.S. Treasury received a maximum 37.5 percent ($63,750) of the fees, and local governments received a minimum of 12.5 percent ($21,250). The effect of reduced grazing on Federal land is expected to vary among counties. The designation of critical habitat is not expected to have significant economic effects within any of the seven counties.    Designation of critical habitat will not affect ongoing mining operations, as the ground disturbances typical of mineral extraction make mine sites unsuitable for tortoise habitat. Expansion of existing mines or development of new mines will require section 7 consultation with the Service. Most of the CHUs include surface areas on which mining claims have been filed. The economic impact of critical habitat designation cannot be determined at the present time due to the uncertainty of economically feasible mineral extraction. Mining claims allow exploration but do not assure exercise of exploration rights, nor do they ensure economic profits to the owner.    The Service was unable to identify significant economic impacts to recreation activities due to critical habitat designation.    Conservation of the desert tortoise and its habitat through designation of critical habitat will result in a wide range of benefits, including recreation values, watershed protection, and others, as well as the values that society places on conservation of the tortoise and its ecosystem. However, it was not possible to place dollar estimates on these values.    As a result of this analysis, the Service concluded that the economic impacts that would be incurred from critical habitat designation would not be significant to either the regional (seven-county) or national economy. The Service did not recommend any exclusions based on economic effects.               "

Answer: Vietnam welcomes the results of the South African  election; the victory of the ANC and the election of Chairman  Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president. This victory is the  result of a long and hard struggle by the South African people  against apartheid.

Answer: There are two different issues here that are  sometimes confused. I would like to clarify the following:    1. Vietnam has had enough historical and juridical documents  to reaffirm its undisputable sovereignty over the Truong Sa  Archipelago. Therefore, foreign activities involving  exploration, surveying, and exploitation of resources in the  Truong Sa Archipelago without Vietnam's permission are in  violation of Vietnamese sovereignty.    With respect to measures to settle the dispute there,  Vietnam  has made it clear that these should be on the basis of equality,  understanding, mutual respect, respect for international law and  the 1982 Convention on Maritime Law, and respect for the  national sovereignty of countries that have special economic  zones and continental shelves. All sides must refrain from  further complicating the situation, using violence, or  threatening to use violence. Vietnam has consistently followed  this line.    2.

The Kelpers are scheduled to begin the  process at the end of the year, with or without Argentina's  approval.    The date for reopening the negotiations (which have been  frozen since 1992) was agreed between Foreign Minister Guido Di  Tella and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd during a meeting  in London on 3 March. Negotiations will be carried out within  the so-called Argentine-British High-Level Group which has been  inactive since negotiations failed in 1992.    Di Tella was scheduled to make a private visit to London  this  coming weekend, but he brought the date forward to 10 March  despite the fact that President Carlos Menem was still in Spain.  His haste to meet with Hurd was reportedly due to the fact that  the meeting was going to take place before this month, but he  still did not have British approval, which was only granted on 3  March.    Di Tella and Hurd also agreed to negotiate through  diplomatic  channels during the time remaining before the meeting -- which  must be carried out in Buenos Aires -- in order to formulate a  basis for a prior agreement to guarantee some positive results  at the key meeting.    One of the hurdles -- beside the conflict over sovereignty  that is being kept under the framework of the so-called  protective ""umbrella"" -- is to define the reaches of the term  cooperation.    -- So far, although it is not a definitive answer, Great  Britain understands that the term only supposes the exchange of  information and the willingness to act jointly to protect the  environment.    -- Argentina, however, thinks that the term supposes  participation in oil exploration and exploitation within the  area controlled by the British.    During the London meeting Di Tella mentioned a topic that is  indirectly related to the Malvinas Islands. He mentioned to  Hurd ""Argentina's concern"" over Great Britain's increasing  political and military relations with Chile.    The Argentine foreign minister mentioned the one-week visit  future Chilean Defense Minister Perez Yoma is scheduled to make  to London and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's  visit to Chile, among other things.    Hurd's answer was that Perez Yoma was invited before he was  named minister and that Thatcher is no longer a member of the  British Government.    Hurd affirmed that London does not want to drive any wedge  between Argentina and Chile; on the contrary, it is interested  in good relations between the two Latin American countries.    The Chilean question was only a side issue of the meeting's  central topic: Oil. Di Tella knows that the issue will be  essential for the success or failure of his Malvinas policy.    The Kelpers are ready to call for bids on the licenses to  begin exploring and exploiting for oil by the end of the year,  if negotiations in May fail.    This is why leading Foreign Ministry officials are thinking  of discussing the issue with U.S. Vice President Al Gore when he  visits Buenos Aires at the end of the month, as CLARIN announced  on 2 March.    What diplomats seem not to have been taken into account is  that Gore supports ecologist concepts which oppose all  ""off-shore"" drilling, due to their negative effects on the  environment. In any case, to play the North American game now  seems premature, unless you believe that the May negotiation  will not succeed due to the distance separating the two parties.     "

0,FT932-17061 ,"FT932-17061 _AN-DDBB7ADNFT 930402   FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Economy the loser from N Sea tax change      From Mr MARTYN DAVID and Others   Sir, Your leader, ''Spoils of the North Sea' (March 29), gives welcome prominence to the chancellor's proposed changes to the North Sea tax regime. We would agree that the most important issue is to ensure that maximum economic benefit is extracted from the North Sea. However, certain points are in danger of becoming 'truths'. First, much has been made of the refund of Pounds 200m of Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) that the government made in 1991-92. This arose from treatment of insurance in connection with a one-off anomaly - the Piper Alpha tragedy. Second, there is no evidence that in North Sea exploration, diminishing returns have set in. Contrary to the falling success rates quoted in your article, the government's own Brown Book statistics show a fairly constant success rate since the early 1970s, albeit as discoveries have become smaller. Finally, the polarisation of companies into winners and losers is not really accurate. Almost any company can become a 'winner' by cutting UK exploration. Turning now to the main issue. The loser will be the UK economy as a whole. The immediate effect will be felt by those companies supplying services to the UK industry whose business will be hard hit as oil companies reduce exploration budgets. It is unrealistic to expect them to find export markets to fill the gap when their domestic business is destroyed at a stroke. The proposed measure will, in the short term, result in job losses among geological and geophysical staff, drilling contractors and others such as helicopter pilots and the crews of support vessels. This is already happening and many jobs will be lost as a result. In the longer term, engineering, fabrication and supplies jobs will suffer. The number of jobs at stake here could run into tens of thousands. There will also be wider consequences in the longer term as drilling fewer wells will inevitably result in less oil being found. The chancellor's proposals quadruple the cost of exploration for oil companies in the UK. This is true even for those companies which have been identified as 'winners' by analysts. We estimate that this could lead to at least 50 per cent fewer wells being drilled over the next five years. At recent average rates of success there will be about 2bn fewer barrels discovered, Pounds 2bn-Pounds 4bn less tax revenues and an adverse effect on the balance of payments of some Pounds 20bn. This is a terrible squandering of a vital national energy resource. The broad thrust of the chancellor's proposals is not in the nation's or the industry's best interests. It is too early to reduce the North Sea to the status of a 'cash cow' for a few investors whose main attentions are turned overseas. The future of the North Sea is characterised by smaller fields which will not now be found or developed. The government must decide whether it wants to see a viable and active oil province. If it does, it should reconsider these changes.

0,FT922-3549 ,"FT922-3549 _AN-CFKBHAAHFT 920611   FT  11 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Mexico faces hard choice in keeping oil out of Nafta - In the first of a series on the North Atlantic free trade area / A look at the effect of the proposed pact on the Mexican oil industry      By DAMIAN FRASER   WITH Cuba, Argentina, and the ex-Soviet Union all opening up oil exploration to foreign companies, Mexico's reform-minded government might be expected to do the same. But wary of tackling Mexico's most potent nationalist symbol, the government insists that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) will not allow foreign exploration of Mexican oil, nor lead to the privatisation of Petreleos Mexicanos (Pemex). President Carlos Salinas at Pemex's recent 54th anniversary was clear enough: 'The property of oil stays uniquely and firmly under the control of the Mexican state'. Mexican trade negotiators have repeated this so often, that there can be little doubt that risk, or wildcat, contracts will not be permitted. The US, sensitive to Mexican nationalist sentiment, has in any case stopped short of demanding changes that would allow wild-catting. The government has ordered Pemex to produce plans for radical reform following the Guadalajara gas explosion in which more than 200 people died. The company is likely to be broken up into subsidiary companies looking after areas such as exploration, refining and gas sales, with the core company operating as a giant contractor. While the government does not intend to sell Pemex, at least in short term, the reform is likely to lead Pemex to contract out much more work to foreign companies. Reform details are likely within the next few days. In the meantime, the US is eyeing other opportunities. The petrochemicals industry is calling for direct investment in Mexico's basic petrochemicals; the gas and oil companies want to sell gas and refined products to the Mexican end-user; contract companies want to make it easier to sell Pemex equipment, and to carry out drilling and other services. The US government may also want a secure oil supply from Mexico guaranteed. Pemex has baulked at such demands, but the Mexican government will concede most of them, because they are consistent with plans to turn Pemex into a modern and lean oil company, focused on production and exploration. Plans to modernise Pemex pre-date the latest reform programme as well as negotiations over Nafta. The government cut the number of petrochemicals reserved to the state to 19 in 1989, and has made clear the number will be cut further after Nafta is signed. Likewise, Pemex has already decided to follow the path the big oil independents took in the 1960s and contract out drilling work to specialist companies. These turn-key projects, to be financed by a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 710m) loan from the US Eximbank, do not break Mexico's constitution, since the company's payment does not depend on the amount of oil found. The first such project was awarded to Triton International last spring, which drilled into the ocean in a record 127 days, half Pemex's normal time. Since then, EPN Sonat, a joint venture between the US company Sonat and the Mexican EPN Arval has won two contracts worth Dollars 100m to drill six wells in the Bay of Campeche. The turn-key projects will not attract the big US oil companies, who rarely do drilling contract work, says Mr Ed Porter of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington. Instead, the market will be left to the small independent engineering and drilling companies. Nafta will make such contracts easier for US and Canadian companies by cutting the paperwork, middlemen, and preference Pemex has in the past shown to Mexican contractors. Perhaps, above all, says Mr Rafael Quijano, of the Petroleum Finance Corporation in Washington, and a former Pemex employee, Nafta will 'create an environment in which contract business can flourish'. But given that total Pemex investment in exploration and production is Dollars 1.7bn this year, the contract work might be worth at most Dollars 500m a year. Many foreign oil companies still hope Mexico will relax regulations against foreign equity investment, but some time after Nafta is signed. Even by the most pessimistic estimates, Pemex has 30bn barrels of crude equivalent in oil reserves, and thus a production reserve ratio of 21-1, double that in the US. Pemex's pressing economic problem is not in finding oil, which is what the big oil independents can offer Mexico, but bringing it up to the ground. That kind of work does not require risk contracts. The US gas producers may have more luck than the big oil independents. Imports of natural gas into Mexico have grown rapidly, because of greater industrial development along the border, and environmental regulations demanding more gas use. Demand is expected to continue to rise, which would require substantial investment in new gas pipelines. Mexico may let US companies build the pipes, but this would require changing current regulatory law. While Pemex may be unwilling to abandon its monopoly in energy exploration, it desperately needs help in refining products; Pemex imported a record Dollars 1.25bn of petroleum and petrochemical products last year. It intends to build a new refinery in central Mexico soon, and expand production at existing ones, at a cost, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, of at least Dollars 8bn. Pemex is looking for a foreign partner in building and financing a refinery, although Pemex will operate the facility. The trouble for Pemex is that little foreign interest has been shown in the schemes Mexico has proposed. Engineering companies do not want to receive payment in refined crude. Oil companies do not want Pemex to operate the final facility, and would like to sell oil they have refined in the Mexican market. One foreign oil executive suggests that as Mexico's import bill for refined products climbs, the government will open up refining and the sale of refined products to foreign oil companies, some time after Nafta is signed. The Guadalajara disaster, for which Pemex was blamed, is increasing the pressure for change. However, opening up exploration and production remain difficult, since the property of oil would still remain 'firmly in the hands of the state'.

0,FT934-5187 ,"FT934-5187 _AN-DLACGABVFT 931201   FT  01 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Oil groups and troubled waters  -Green issues versus commercial realities      By BRONWEN MADDOX   Imagine you are the chairman of one of the world's largest oil companies. In the middle of October, a letter arrived, demanding, among other things, that you immediately stop all exploration and drilling of oil and gas reserves. The letter's author is Paul Gilding, the Amsterdam-based executive director of Greenpeace International, one of the world's largest environmental pressure groups. Reasons why it might be unwise to dispose of the letter spring to mind. You worry that environmental lobbying may influence planning applications and lead to tighter regulation. You also want to head off any chance of the 'direct action' which has made Greenpeace's reputation; for example recently four inflatable dinghies launched from Greenpeace's boat Solo hung a banner from an exploration rig operated by Shell in the Barents Sea. So how should you respond? 'With interest but with some dismay', British Petroleum told Gilding. 'Unrealistic and not a helpful contribution to the debate', Shell International Petroleum said in a response which stressed the company's care for the environment. However Greenpeace is adamant that its demands, fired off to more than 20 companies and industry groups, are not unreasonable. The threat of global warming, its letter says, 'is too great for any of us to continue the massive burning of fossil fuels'. At last year's Rio Earth Summit, governments pledged to find ways of curbing carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, following warnings from the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC). Greenpeace's international oil campaigner, Paul Horsman, argues the oil companies are 'worse villains' than governments. In his view, 'they have been involved in amazing lobbying against the Rio commitments and proposals such as energy taxes'. He wants them to divert some of their research and development budget to 'renewable' energy sources such as solar, wind and wave power. To oil companies, many of whom conduct research into renewables, these demands ignore commercial realities. Michael Herbert, head of external affairs at Shell International Petroleum, says that 'the cost of renewables is still colossal - rapidly phasing out fossil fuels is not credible if we are to meet the world's rising demand for energy, including that of developing countries'. However nuclear power, one of the available alternatives to fossil fuels, is anathema to Greenpeace. Some oil companies also feel that Greenpeace misrepresents the available scientific evidence on global warming and assumes, in BP's words, 'that scientific consensus is far greater than it actually is'. While the IPCC is scrupulous about not being drawn into this kind of dispute, it does emphasise the uncertainties of its projections. David Bennetts, research co-ordinator of the Hadley Centre in Berkshire, England, which co-ordinates the IPCC's scientific assessments, says: 'It is certainly true (as Greenpeace claims) that you cannot burn the world's proven reserves of oil without the world warming. But what I cannot tell you is whether that rate of warming would be fast enough to be dangerous'. Outside observers might see this as a predictable standoff between natural opponents. But the Greenpeace letter also carries a curiously dated air. Some environmentalists and businessmen feel that as pollution regulation has been tightened over the past decade - much of it due to the efforts of environmental pressure groups - the venom has been taken out of the traditional battle between greenery and smokestacks. It is hard not to have some sympathy with Shell's view that 'Rio spelled out the dilemmas facing the world', particularly the hard choices between the environment and economic development. 'It is these dilemmas we should be worrying about - it is unhelpful to go back to confrontation'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

The sale is part of the company's drive to focus on its core exploration areas and to withdraw from countries where it has failed to reach a critical mass. It follows BP's departure from the Qatar gas project last week. The assets sold include its 33.33 per cent stakes in two oil concessions containing the Ras Budran, Ras Fanar and Zeit Bay fields where BP's share of production is 15,000 barrels a day. BP has been exploring in Egypt for 15 years, but the company was not a significant presence in the country's oil industry. The company has retained its 25 per cent stake in the El Qar'a gas project which is still under development.  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "

""The demand for petroleum, which is now the main source of  energy, will continue to grow as the incomes of the people rise.  Therefore, although Indonesia is still a petroleum exporting  country, with the present growth in consumption it will be a  petroleum importing country in the future.""    The chief state said this Saturday [5 March] as he  inaugurated the PERTAMINA [National Oil and Natural Gas  Company]-Atlantic Richfield Bali North, Incorporated, [ARBNI]  natural gas production and transport facilities in the  Pagerungan Islands and the PERTAMINA-Atlantic Richfield  Indonesia, Incorporated, [ARII] natural gas production and  transport facilities at Sidoardjo in East Java.    Therefore, according to the president, efforts to conserve  and diversify energy sources must be made consistently and  continuously. In this connection, the use of natural gas, the  reserves of which are quite large, is very important.    The chief of state said that the use of natural gas as a raw  material in making fertilizer has stimulated development in the  agriculture sector. Through the success of agricultural  development, millions of farmers have increased their earnings,  and the growth of domestic industry has been stimulated.    ""Natural gas has now become an important export commodity.  No  small amount of foreign exchange has been earned from natural  gas exports,"" the chief of state said.    Indonesian natural gas enters a new era with the  inauguration  of these two projects in the natural gas sector. The Indonesian  people will use natural gas on a large scale for domestic needs.    Natural gas flowing through the PERTAMINA-ARII production  and  transport facilities off the northwest coast of Java will be  used to fuel the steam-electric power plants at Muara Karang and  Tanjung Priok.    With the construction of Pagerungan PERTAMINA-ARBNI natural  gas production and transport facilities, all the fuel  requirements of the gas-fueled steam power plant at Gresik will  be met. Gas from that project will also be used by the State Gas  Company to meet the needs of homes and small industry in and  around Surabaya and as a raw material for the petrochemical  industry.    Indonesia is now experiencing a great increase in electric  power demand because of the progress of industrial development.  If that demand for power cannot be met, the industrialization  process will be hindered.    The chief of state said that because of the importance of  natural gas to future development, the government will keep  encouraging exploration activity. Although natural gas reserves  are now quite large, the search for new reserves needs to  continue into order to meet long-term demand.    ""There is a good possibility of this, because geologically  Indonesia possesses very great natural gas resources. I am  confident that, with the support of advances in science and  technology, there is still a great possibility of finding new  oil and gas in Indonesia,"" the chief of state said.    It is hoped that the success achieved by ARII and ARBNI  under  production-sharing contracts will create optimism among other  contractors working in Indonesia that there is a big chance of  finding new oil and gas in the country.    The chief of state said that in the development of oil and  natural gas efforts, the government has listened to complaints  about oil and natural gas exploration in Indonesia. A positive  dialogue needs to be developed between PERTAMINA and its  partners with regard to the various methods that can enhance  their mutual benefit.    In this connection, on 31 December 1993 the Indonesian  Government issued a new incentive package that is more conducive  to exploration and production activity.    Background    At the beginning of 1992, PERTAMINA and ARCO Indonesia  contracted with PLN [State Electricity Public Corporation] to  supply 260 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for 11  years beginning in 1994.    The natural gas will be used as fuel for the gas-fueled  steam  power plants at Muara Karang and Tanjung Priok, which are  long-term projects scheduled for phased implementation. The  first phase, implemented on 1 September 1993, was conducted as a  ""fast track"" by the direct appointment of an implementing  contractor.    The second, third, and fourth phases are to supply 50  million  cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Bima and Northwest  Corner Fields and develop existing natural gas reserves as an  effort to maintain natural gas supplies until 2004. Initial  capital for phase one until production will be more than $300  million. For development through phase six, the total cost is  estimated to be $824 million. This investment will be used to  expand 5 platforms to 29 platforms, 135 kilometers of pipeline  to 423 kilometers, and 11 production wells to 89.    Benefits    Many benefits of the presence of ARCO at Pagerungan were  reported to President Suharto, but the president did not accept  the reports at face value. In a dialogue with members of the  Pagerungan community who gathered at Permisan Village, Jabon,  Sidoarjo, the president asked them directly about the benefits  of the presence of ARCO in its involvement with natural gas.    Haji Djaelani, leader of the ""Abu Hurairah"" Islamic Boarding  School at Pagerungan frankly answered the president by saying  that the presence of the project is very beneficial to residents  of Pagerungan. ""Damaged, unusable school buildings, both secular  and Islamic, have now taken on a new look,"" he said. Similarly,  a fisherman from Wadjo, who had long lived there, expressed his  many thanks for the project.    Also, a teacher from there has experienced the facilities:  ARCO has built a new school, and he obtained a new house near  the school. A cooperative managed by teachers has been  developed, too. A Pagerungan PKK [Family Welfare Development]  manager asked for communications facilities to facilitate his  work of visiting isolated groups on some of the islands. ""I  request communications facilities to facilitate my work,"" he  said expectantly.    The president later asked ARCO to take part in considering  the request. A young man then followed by speaking of the  potential of existing neighborhood youth associations. The  president asked the young man to take part in finding  alternatives for fishermen who cannot go to sea in the  off-season so that their energies can be put to use. He said  that Pagerungan fishermen cannot work during the westerly  monsoon. ""Find a good alternative--using other skills,  naturally--so that fisherman can continue to work during the  westerly monsoon."" The regent of Sumenep also accompanied  members of the community in the dialogue with the president.     "

""We feel we have satisfied their concerns concerning the overall response  capability of the (Clean Seas) organization and see no reason why exploration  drilling or any other drilling shouldn't be allowed to continue,"" Onstad said.

Listing of Actions, Failures, and Refusals That Subject Individuals to Penalties        Finally, OSM, in the November 12, 1993, letter, notified North Dakota that, unlike section 518(f) of SMCRA, proposed NDCC 3812.108 does not explicitly include failure of refusal to comply with orders of the Commission as cause to subject individuals to penalties. In addition, OSM noted that the North Dakota coal exploration program does not explicitly address the issuance of orders by the Commission and that the program was approved by OSM on the basis of North Dakota's agreement to issue each coal exploration permit with a specific condition subjecting it to the requirements of 30 CFR 840, 842, 843, 845, and 43 CFR part 4 (see 45 FR 82214, 82226; December 15, 1980) Section 518(f) of SMCRA subjects individuals to penalties when corporate permittees fail or refuse to comply with enforcement orders or any order (with minor exceptions) incorporated in a final decision of the regulatory authority.    In the December 3, 1993, letter, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that its provisions at NDCC 3812.108 regarding liability and penalties for failure to comply with orders of the Industrial Commission should be clearer, and expressed its willingness to approach the North Dakota Legislature in 1995 to request an amendment to NDCC 3812.108 to include civil and criminal penalties for violations such orders.    The Director agrees that North Dakota must amend NDCC 3812.108. Therefore, the Director is not approving proposed NDCC 3812.108 and is requiring North Dakota to amend its program to require that, in addition to violations, failure or refusal to comply with such orders, as listed in section 518(f) of SMCRA and issued by the North Dakota Industrial Commission, serves as an additional basis for imposing individual civil and criminal penalties upon corporate officers, directors, and agents. The required program amendment placed on North Dakota's program at 30 CFR 934.16(y), as a result of a January 9, 1992, rulemaking action (57 FR 807, 82324) will be modified to reflect this decision.

0,FT923-11602 ,"FT923-11602 _AN-CGWASAF3FT 920723   FT  23 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke suffers steep fall      By JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON   PROPERTY and leisure group Ladbroke plunged in very heavy turnover as a combination of technical factors and renewed trading worries hit the stock. The shares continued to tumble in after-hours' trading as rumours circulated that the group would be issuing a statement today. A spokesman for Ladbroke dismissed the story as 'rubbish'. Early trading was dominated by two large lines of stock which had difficulty finding a home. Later, talk again focused on Ladbroke's exposure to the wilting US property market and the flat UK consumer market, where its leisure and DIY interests are suffering badly. The shares closed 17 off at 158p - their lowest since January 1988 - in turnover exceeding 7m. Traders were marking the shares down by as much as a further 15p in after-hours' trade as nervousness grew that a gloomy statement may be forthcoming. Lasmo steadier Further good news on the exploration front staunched the latest flow of selling in Lasmo, the oil exploration and production group. Lasmo shares have been undermined by a succession of bearish stories since the company's takeover of Ultramar. The group said yesterday that an exploration well in Morecambe Bay, off the coast of England, had produced an oil flow of 1,370 barrels a day, as well as gas from a separate zone. Lasmo has a 30 per cent stake in the block containing the oil and gas discovery. Monument Oil  Gas has a 20 per cent holding. The oil and gas find is the second piece of encouraging drilling news for Lasmo this week. On Monday, the group's Indonesian gas reserves were sharply increased following an independent evaluation. Lasmo is due to announce interim figures next Wednesday. The stock settled 1 1/2 off at 125p, having fallen to 123p earlier in the day. Monument managed a minor gain at 32 1/4 p. Carlton wanted An improved recommendation from the company's broker was said to be behind the rise in new Footsie constituent Carlton Communications. The stock was the day's strongest among the FT-SE 100 components, appreciating 11 to 585p. Cazenove, which never comments on market speculation, was believed to have put Carlton on its buy list, focusing on news that the group's Technicolor unit had retained a film processing contract from Sony's Columbia Tri-Star. However, some analysts said fears of Carlton losing the contract had actually faded a few months ago. Varied attitudes among London share analysts following Tuesday's interim report from Reuters left the stock sharply lower. After some erratic trading, the bear view prevailed and the shares closed a further 35 down at 1090p. Agency broker James Capel reinforced its sell advice and argued that Reuters' cash mountain of Pounds 600m did not fit well with its high price/earnings ratio. BZW said: 'The company is now right at the top end of UK growth stock ratings,' adding that Reuters needs to approach 1025p before becoming attractive. However, broker Hoare Govett points out that the company is some 35 per cent held in the US, where its p/e relative is not nearly so demanding. Hoare is maintaining its buy stance and is considering raising its full-year profits forecast to Pounds 380m. Mirror Group Newspapers continued to rise against the market, with most traders believing a stakebuilder was at work. The shares firmed 1 3/4 to 65 1/4 p on another heavy turnover of 6.1m. Marketmakers are convinced that one buyer has been constantly picking up the shares with a view to a bid or, alternatively, a belief that the stock offers very good value. Most analysts say institutional investors acknowledge the value in MGN but are staying well clear because of the Maxwell aura still surrounding the company. The property sector picked itself up from its recent drubbing as bargain hunters were spotted. British Land, helped by a County NatWest note on superstore investments, put on 2 to 186p. Greycoat's good run continued as James Capel was reported to be positive ahead of today's figures, for which there is hope that the dividend will be held. Hammerson, missing from most broker's recent recommendations, at last found some support, the 'A' shares bouncing 8 to 260p. MEPC gained 7 to 267p, Land Securities 4 to 387p and Slough Estates 5 to 127p. Southend Properties jumped 6 to 42p on well-received results. SmithKline Beecham units were a penny firmer at 413p as one US house upgraded the company to a strong buy, but the 'A' shares eased 3 to 454p. After several days of selling pressure, Thorn EMI bounced initially with the help of a supportive note from Hoare Govett, the securities house, arguing that the group was now at the bottom of its relative range. News that the loss-making security division may be off-loaded, and a trade press feature claiming that the Office of Fair Trading would not be investigating compact disc prices, also helped sentiment. The OFT rejected the press comments, stressing that no decision had yet been taken on whether to launch an inquiry. The shares were finally 2 easier on balance at 743p. Unigate slipped 9 to 277p after chairman Sir Brian Kellett told the annual meeting that 'we must expect the present difficult trading conditions to continue for the time being'. Regional brewer Morland reversed an initial gain to finish a net 2 off at 461p, ahead of tomorrow's closing day for the bid from Greene King, 6 cheaper at 514p. Enterprise Oil rallied well, adding 6 1/2 at 325 1/2 p, with dealers arguing that the recent steep fall in the shares had been overdone. The stock was also helped by a bullish note on the exploration and production sub-sector issued by Hoare Govett. The combination of a large seller and the effects of an overhang of stock on dealers' books caused Siebe to drop 24 to 639p. Weakness in the construction sector was only one of the factors that undermined Trafalgar House. The shares gave up 5 1/2 to 67 1/2 p as dealers also focused on fears about the dividend and uncertainty over the Hong Kong Airport project, for which Trafalgar is a major contractor. Poor sentiment in the construction sector left P  O 14 lighter at 344p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (5).

About 200 European companies will attend the three-day, by-invitation-only event where they will be presented with details of nearly 200 projects in 10 of the SADAC (Southern African Development Community) countries: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The EU points out that annual mineral production in the region is worth an estimated USDollars 4bn and the mining sector's contribution to gross domestic product is substantial, averaging 11 per cent for the region. Nevertheless, the potential for developing new small and medium-sized mines is large but this has not been realised because of lack of investment. The region also offers great exploration potential.

Forty-three responses, mostly from mooring masters and shipping companies, offered strong support for the safety zone expansion. Opposition to the proposal came from CONOCO, MMS, and three oil exploration companies. MMS suggested that if CONOCO or other lessees are denied access to potential oil and gas resources, restitution should be provided by either LOOP or the Coast Guard. Neither the Coast Guard nor the DOT is prepared to provide restitution to CONOCO for loss of potential revenues or costs already incurred in conjunction with oil or gas exploration.    To resolve the conflicting use problems in the excursion zones, LOOP has agreed to purchase from CONOCO the oil and gas leases for Grand Isle Blocks 53, 58, 59, and 65. LOOP would then relinquish these blocks to MMS. LOOP would not seek further expansion of the safety zone or oppose any exploration and production activity outside or adjacent to the expanded safety zone.    On November 2, 1993, in a letter to the Department of Transportation, the MMS stated that it supports the agreement between CONOCO and LOOP. MMS stated that it is prepared to prohibit surface occupancy of offshore oil and gas facilities in the proposed safety zone. However, MMS stated that it may be economically and technically feasible to develop the resources lying beneath the safety zone by directional drilling. MMS would not preclude subseabed access provided that any surface facilities are located outside the safety zone. Such subseabed activity within the safety zone would not interfere with vessel activity in the safety zone.    Under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1509(d)(1)), the Secretary of Transportation is required to consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Commerce prior to issuing the safety zone around any deepwater port for the purposes of navigational safety. The Coast Guard has informed the noted Departments of the proposed safety zone.        Discussion of Proposed Amendment        Appendix A, Annex A, section (a) of 33 CFR part 150 is amended to expand the boundaries of the deepwater port safety zone at LOOP. This is being done at the request of LOOP, Inc. to enlarge the approach to the terminal portion and provide more maneuvering area for tank vessels arriving or departing from the deepwater port. It does not amend the Areas to be Avoided or the Anchorage Area listed in sections (b) and (c), respectively, in Annex A to Appendix A of 33 CFR part 150.        Regulatory Assessment        This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(F)(1) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993) and it does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It is not a significant regulation under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).    The Coast Guard expects the economic consequences of this rulemaking to be minimal. Potential economic effects include impacts on mineral extraction and the commercial fishing industry. The proposed expansion is relatively insignificant, comprising an approximate 15 percent increase in the size of the safety zone.    When the original safety zone was established, it was not expected that there would be significant interference with mineral extraction or navigation. Due to the relative size of the expansion, no impacts on mineral extraction or navigation are expected in this case either. Access is available via alternative methods such as directional drilling.    The economic consequences of the proposed rulemaking are expected to primarily impact commercial vessels, including commercial fishing vessels. Commercial fishing vessels are permitted restricted use of portions of the safety zone as provided in 33 CFR Table 150.345(a). Therefore, the impact on fishing activities would be negligible due to the small additional area involved. No opposition to the notice of petition for rulemaking was received from the commercial fishing industry.    In addition, this proposed rulemaking will result in permanent safety benefits. Providing additional maneuvering area minimizes the likelihood of a catastrophic pollution incident resulting from a vessel colliding with any portion of the LOOP facility. Therefore, it is expected that expansion of the safety zone will reduce the environmental hazard.

'We would both like to form a long-term partnership,' said Mr John Bueno, general manager of British Gas Argentina. Such an alliance would, in addition to other projects, seek to explore waters between Argentina and the Falkland Islands. British Gas already has a big presence in Argentina with important stakes in privatised gas distribution and power companies. But Mr Bueno stressed that talks between the companies could go no further until the British and Argentine governments had constructed the political framework within which exploration could proceed. Although Argentina was defeated in the 1982 war over the Falklands, it has not relinquished its claim over the islands, ownership of which was recently enshrined in the constitution.

Yet there are signs of anxiety in the large industrial estates which house the UK's offshore oil industry. The combination of a weak oil price and plenty of spare capacity in drilling and contracting has led to belt-tightening and close questioning of the industry's prospects. In addition, changes recommended in the Cullen Report on North Sea safety, following the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster in which 167 workers died, will add substantially to the industry's costs. Mr Norman Chambers, chief executive of Rockwater, one of the leading underwater engineering contractors, predicts that demand in his sector of the North Sea services industry will begin to tail off next year, the exact rate depending on the oil price. 'The whole contracting and fabricating industry must downsize,' he warns. 'We're bullish for our own company, but we've got to be realistic about it.' His views are echoed by Mr Gavin Strachan, marketing and contracts manager of Atlantic Drilling, an independent drilling contractor. He points out that at present rigs are used to 78 per cent capacity, compared with more than 90 per cent needed to sustain a healthy market. This has caused daily charge rates to drop by half to about Pounds 12,000. 'Last year, for the first time, there were more rigs available in the North Sea than in the Gulf of Mexico,' he says. Operators blame the softening of the market - at the moment it is nothing more dramatic than that - on two things: the low oil price which is blunting incentive to explore, and the widespread feeling that all the big North Sea finds have been made. The fact that most current developments are much smaller than in the glory days of the 1970s and early 1980s also makes them much easier for operators to stop and start, adding uncertainty to the market. The industry had made improvements ahead of the Cullen recommendations, but the new rules, to be phased in from the end of this year, will add a further burden. The safety modifications might cost an average of Pounds 1m a rig, says Mr John Archibald, Atlantic's deputy general manager. The outlook is not totally gloomy, however. A fresh round of exploration licences has been announced, including 'frontier regions' - areas of the North Sea and its western approaches that have not yet been explored. The softening of the market has also encouraged the offshore contracting industry to think afresh about its long-term future. The oil and gas group of Scottish Enterprise, the state-funded development body, has decided that the time has come for 'a long-term reorientation of the industry from the diminishing home market to international markets'. Last month Mr Crawford Beveridge, SE's chief executive, announced plans for an export drive aimed at doubling overseas sales by 1996, equivalent to growth of about Pounds 100m in 1990 money. 'Expansion of our indigenous oil and gas companies will only ultimately be generated via internationalisation,' he says. One element of this drive will be the establishment of a sales office in Moscow, where SE sees opportunities for Scottish industry to help develop the oil and gas industry in the former Soviet republics. About Pounds 25m has been earmarked for the office, spread over several years. Aberdeen is also the home of a new International Drilling and Downhole Technology Centre where oil companies can test offshore equipment on a real-life rig, but in the safer and cheaper surroundings of dry land. Dr David Curry, managing director, says: 'We shall be developing technology which can be exported when the oil runs down.' However, individual companies will have to adjust to tougher conditions in the meantime. Mr Chambers of Rockwater predicts that contracting companies will have to share more of the risk with the oil companies in order to win business. In certain cases the company is prepared to forego the traditional client relationship in favour of forming partnerships with oil exploration companies. Rockwater will do contracting work at cost, and take its profit in the form of a share of the royalties. Last week two Glasgow companies, Kvaerner HG and UIE, entered into similar arrangements with British Petroleum to develop the Hyde gas field. BP said partnerships 'are certainly something we are looking at'. For companies like Atlantic, hope in the future is grounded partly in controlling costs and partly in the belief that oil companies will be forced to step up their search for oil. 'Why do we remain in the drilling business?', asks Mr Strachan. The answer lies in figures which show that available oil reserves are being run down, but that the exploration potential is still huge. 'The long-term strength of the business is that we're going to have to find lots more oil,' he says.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

In all, there were 10 El Rancho High School students with enough smarts to  carry on the school's tradition of excellence in the Southeast Region of the  1990 Los Angeles County Academic Decathlon.    For the second time in the last three years, El Rancho High School students  have won the Southeast Region of the county decathlon, the nation's largest  academic contest. The group of 10 students last month beat out competitors from  20 other high schools in the challenging contest that included such questions  as: ""What country made the mechanical arm for the space shuttle?"" ""What was  George Bush doing when Nixon resigned?"" and ""Who was the fifth Beatle?""    El Rancho High School won the Southeast Region in 1988, and last year placed  second to Cerritos High School. In overall county standings this year, the El  Rancho team placed 14th out of 83 schools.    ""We're excited,"" El Rancho Principal David Verdugo said. ""We compete against  some schools with outstanding reputations. . . . The results speak for the  entire school.""    The team members are juniors Joanne Szeto, Matthew Walker, Sheila Panganiban,  Demosthenes Spiropoulos, Mai T. Le and Federico Moran, and seniors Ernesto  Carreon, Marisol Pugliese, Jay Boyette and Michael Weinholt.    The team members attributed their victory to hard work, team spirit and plain  common sense.    ""A lot of it is logic,"" said Weinholt, who was the region's top scorer in the  scholastic category.    According to rules of the decathlon, teams must consist of three students each  with A, B and C grade averages. The A students are known as honor students, B  as scholastic and C as varsity. The 10th team member is an alternate.    The academic decathlon was started in Orange County in 1968. It went statewide  in 1979, and in 1982 became a national competition. This year's winner of the  Los Angeles County competition, West High School of Torrance, will compete at  the state decathlon in Riverside next March.    Decathlon competitors are given written and verbal examinations on subjects  including economics, language, literature, fine arts, mathematics, science and  history. Students also must give prepared and extemporaneous speeches. In the  last and by far the most intense phase of the contest, individual students are  bombarded with questions in front of a gymnasium full of students, parents and  teachers. This year's theme was space exploration and the decades of the 1960s  and 1970s.    Preparation at El Rancho began last May, when the team members were drafted.  Some students were selected by their teachers, others volunteered. The crucial  test to determine whether a student had the mettle to compete in the decathlon  came when school let out for the summer. It was then, coach Doug Anderson said,  that team members had to meet at the school at 6:30 every morning for more than  two months to study for the decathlon.    For many students, the idea of giving up the leisurely morning sleep of summer  to study for an extracurricular test is repugnant, but decathlon team members  said it was worth it.

The students also said that in studying for the decathlon, they learned to  think under pressure and that the intense preparation sessions helped them more  than regular classes to learn.

AXEL  KOESTER / For The Times    "," LA120690-0210   318623    December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition      Long Beach; Part J; Page 1; Column 4      633 words      EL RANCHO REGAINS TITLE IN ACADEMIC CONTEST      By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      PICO RIVERA      There was a drummer whose academic strength lay in fine arts and language, a  saxophone player who knew more about space exploration than most adults, and a  drama student for whom speech and interviewing skills were second nature.    In all, there were 10 El Rancho High School students with enough smarts to  carry on the school's tradition of excellence in the Southeast Region of the  1990 Los Angeles County Academic Decathlon.    For the second time in the last three years, El Rancho High School students  have won the Southeast Region of the county decathlon, the nation's largest  academic contest. The group of 10 students last month beat out competitors from  20 other high schools in the challenging contest that included such questions  as: ""What country made the mechanical arm for the space shuttle?"" ""What was  George Bush doing when Nixon resigned?"" and ""Who was the fifth Beatle?""    El Rancho High School won the Southeast Region in 1988, and last year placed  second to Cerritos High School. In overall county standings this year, the El  Rancho team placed 14th out of 83 schools.    ""We're excited,"" El Rancho Principal David Verdugo said. ""We compete against  some schools with outstanding reputations. . . . The results speak for the  entire school.""    The team members are juniors Joanne Szeto, Matthew Walker, Sheila Panganiban,  Demosthenes Spiropoulos, Mai T. Le and Federico Moran, and seniors Ernesto  Carreon, Marisol Pugliese, Jay Boyette and Michael Weinholt.    The team members attributed their victory to hard work, team spirit and plain  common sense.    ""A lot of it is logic,"" said Weinholt, who was the region's top scorer in the  scholastic category.    According to rules of the decathlon, teams must consist of three students each  with A, B and C grade averages. The A students are known as honor students, B  as scholastic and C as varsity. The 10th team member is an alternate.    The academic decathlon was started in Orange County in 1968. It went statewide  in 1979, and in 1982 became a national competition. This year's winner of the  Los Angeles County competition, West High School of Torrance, will compete at  the state decathlon in Riverside next March.    Decathlon competitors are given written and verbal examinations on subjects  including economics, language, literature, fine arts, mathematics, science and  history. Students also must give prepared and extemporaneous speeches.

In their speeches, comrades, with deep  feelings, extolled Comrade Mao's outstanding contributions,  spoke highly of the party's experiences in inheriting and  developing Chairman Mao's great causes gained since the third  plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, and looked  forward to the Chinese nation's bright future in the 21st  century. So, I profoundly experienced their deep love and  esteem of Chairman Mao. I think that anyone who is growing up  from old China understands that the motherland turned itself  gradually from a state of being enslaved and devastated to a  rich and powerful country, and recalls the great leader  pioneering the cause of revolution and construction.    There are only seven years remaining until the end of the  20th century. As far as the Chinese nation is concerned, the  20th century was not only a gravely disastrous century, but also  one in which to create brilliance again. In the first half of  the century before 1949, China overthrew the rule of  imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism and created  the fighting history of new China. In the latter half of the  century, the Chinese people worked arduously to pioneer  undertakings and explored ways to build, consolidate, and  develop the history of socialism. We cannot divorce ourselves  from the name of Mao Zedong when reviewing these two arduous and  brilliant sections of history.    China was confronted with two historical tasks in modern  times: One was national independence and the liberation of the  people. The other was to make the country powerful. Comrade  Mao Zedong struggled all his lifetime to fulfill these two  tasks. This embodied his historical contributions. We can say  that Comrade Mao Zedong did two great deeds during his lifetime.  The first great deed was that he led the party and the people  to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and  bureaucrat-capitalism and accomplished the tasks of democratic  revolution. Proceeding from Chinese history and the specific  situation of society and on the basis of summing up the  experiences of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, Comrade Mao  Zedong created the theory on new democratic revolution and  discovered the revolutionary road of encircling the cities from  the rural areas. Comrade Mao Zedong, with gigantic theoretical  courage, resolutely proceeded from reality, resolutely resisted  the influence of both domestic and foreign dogmatism, gained  experiences from setbacks and failures, and discovered the  accurate revolutionary roads suitable to the Chinese national  situation. As a result, China won a victory in revolution.  This was the first great matter task by Comrade Mao Zedong  during his lifetime. The second great task was that he made  efforts to explore ways to build China's socialism after  accomplishing the transformation of socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Comrade Mao Zedong was one to make such  explorations. He was the first person to acutely discover the  malpractice and weak points of the socialist pattern of the  Soviet Union and definitely advocated that China should have its  own way of building socialism. To this end, he guided the  Chinese people to arduously explore and took extremely tortuous  roads. He left many brilliant ideas through these exploration  courses, and these ideas are still of important guiding  significance.    We may say that Comrade Mao Zedong left us with an  unaccomplished will of making the country strong and the people  rich. He failed to see with his own eyes the fruitful results  of his undertakings of exploration and creation. The  undertakings left unaccomplished are being realized with the  efforts of CPC members, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their  representative. On the basis of summing up, according to the  principle of seeking truth from facts, both positive and  negative experiences and lessons gained since the founding of  the PRC and in line with the new practical experiences, Comrade  Deng Xiaoping, with gigantic theoretical courage, defined that  our country's socialist system is still in the ""initial stage,""  set forth a series of policies and principles for reform, and  summarized these policies and principles into the theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic  line of ""one center and two basic points,"" and finally found the  road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics that Mao  Zedong failed to find at that time. This is the only way for  developing socialist China and the way for China to seek  prosperity and stand among various nations in the world.  Through the arduous efforts of the people of the whole country  in the past 15 years, our country's gross national product has  doubled and the people are striding toward the target of being  fairly well-off. With full confidence, we can tell Comrade Mao  Zedong that his aspiration of catching up with and surpassing  the developed countries in the world is being realized.    To recall Chairman Mao's fruitful achievements, we should  emulate Mao Zedong; inherit and develop Mao Zedong Thought; use  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to guide the work in various aspects;  accelerate the progress of reform, opening up, and  modernization; and ensure long-term peace, stability, and  prosperity of the country.    To emulate Mao Zedong, we should conscientiously study his  thinking and work style of seeking truth from facts, proceeding  from reality, and linking theory with practice. Comrade Mao  Zedong had a good command of Marxism and the Chinese traditional  culture. Foreign conventions or ancient conventions restricted  him from exploring ways for the Chinese revolution. He always  opposed the practice of studying theories not according to the  Chinese socialism and the reality of the Chinese revolution.  Early in 1930, he opposed book worship and stressed that  without investigations there would be no right to speak. The  greatest reality we are confronted with now is to promote the  large-scale development of socialist productive forces through  the setup of the socialist market economic system. As far as  our province is concerned, we should grasp favorable  opportunities, intensify reform, expand the scale of opening up,  speed up the pace of development, and strive to build the  province into an economically powerful province. As a large  province near Beijing, Hebei will be unworthy of not only its 63  million people, but also Comrade Mao Zedong's cordial concern  with and earnest aspirations for Hebei during his lifetime, if  we are unable to make a faster development or continue to widen  the gaps with advanced provinces and municipalities. So, we  should go deep to the forefront of reform and development, exert  efforts to study the new situation, and use the new ideas and  methods that are suitable to the requirements of the market  economy to solve various kinds of complicated problems relating  to deep-layered reform work. We should thoroughly change the  mental state of sticking to old conventions, remaining undecided  or adopting a wait-and-see attitude when faced with favorable  opportunities, and being blindly self- satisfied in the course  of development. The broad masses of cadres in the province  should actually form a brand-new outlook of seeking truth from  facts and emancipating the mind.    To emulate Mao Zedong, we should conscientiously study Mao  Zedong's thinking of sharing woe and weal with the people and  serving the people wholeheartedly. Mao Zedong often exhorted  that the whole party was the vanguard of the proletariat,  existed and fought for the interests of the people, and was  always a small part of the people; and that once the party was  divorced from the people, it would fail to realize its ideals  and its struggles would become meaningless. On the eve of the  victory in democratic revolution, Mao Zedong predicted that  there would be dangers of being divorced from the masses within  the party. We should firmly remember Chairman Mao's exhortation  to the whole party when he was in Xibaipo and continue to  maintain the style of being modest and prudent and guarding  against arrogance and rashness.    We should continue to maintain the style of arduous  struggle,  always take root among the masses, always persist in the purpose  of serving the people wholeheartedly, and make unswerving  efforts to fundamentally improve party style and social practice.    To emulate Mao Zedong, we should conscientiously study the  spirit of bravely exploring and arduously doing pioneering work  as advocated and practiced by Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong constantly  regarded the world as an endless development course and took his  own undertakings as a course of continuous exploration and  pursuit. He was never satisfied with existing achievements and  constantly regarded existing achievements as a starting point  for his new explorations and pioneering work. We can say that  Mao Zedong made ceaseless efforts to make explorations and do  pioneering work during his lifetime. Some of his explorations  became brilliant historical contributions; and some became  precious ideological heritage in the form of experiences and  lessons and also guided us to make wider and deeper explorations  and do pioneering work today. The Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is just the result  and fruit of the explorations in the past 10 years or so. Our  purpose to study the Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping is to make better new explorations and do  new pioneering work. The year 1994 will arrive soon. Next year  will be a key year to comprehensively reform the economic system  and speed up the setup of the socialist market economic system,  as well as to satisfactorily fulfill the Eighth Five-Year Plan  and quadruple the gross national product ahead of schedule. So,  we should grasp the new favorable opportunity of reform and  development and adopt a fighting attitude to devote ourselves to  the great exploration and pioneering undertaking.    Comrades: Let us inherit and develop the undertakings  pioneered by Mao Zedong, persistently take Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as guidance, ceaselessly keep forging ahead, and  capture a new victory in reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization.

The issue has been given broad coverage in the Turkish press  as it was linked to the underwater drilling being conducted near  Thasos for the exploration of oil. But in an attempt to defuse  the issue, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel admitted that the  drilling is being conducted in Greek territorial waters.  However, Demirel added that if the explorations extend beyond  Greece's territorial waters there might be complications, since  no agreement has been reached on the question of the Aegean  continental shelf.

0,FT921-12246 ,"FT921-12246 _AN-CA1BTACVFT 920128   FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yemen's oil-fired optimism - Bidding has been intense for exploration rights      By ERIC WATKINS   NEW DISCOVERIES of oil, gas and precious metals are leading the way to brighter economic prospects in Yemen, long considered one of the world's least developed countries. Precise estimates of the country's potential have yet to be determined, but experts are enthusiastic about initial signs. Exploration rights have been purchased by 18 oil companies over the past year and one of them, Canadian Occidental, has already reported a major find. Located at Masila, in southern Yemen, the new field was early this month declared commercially viable, with total reserves at 550m barrels, of which 235m barrels are recoverable. Can-Oxy plans to start production in mid-1993 after an accelerated programme of development. With exploration still in the early stages experts are wary of making precise predictions about Yemen's oil potential. But most agree that the country will be able to produce about 1m b/d in the foreseeable future. Though Yemen's first commercial strike was in the north, most exploration is now concentrated in the south, particularly around Shabwa in the Hadramaut Valley. Oil companies had long suspected that there were considerable reserves there, but concession rights in the former Marxist state were dominated by the Soviet Union. Unification of North and South Yemen in May 1990 opened the way for western companies and the new Yemen government has been quick to capitalise on the competition, selling rights this year alone for an estimated Dollars 700m. Oil executives say that competition for concessions has been intense and that the bidding for rights has been unusually high. But they point out the potential rewards. Yemen's oil is said to be first-rate, with a low sulphur content and a high ratio of associated gas. Comparable in quality to Arabian light crude, Yemen's oil is said to require little refining and so may attract premium prices on the world market. While optimistic about Yemen's potential, oil executives nonetheless state that full commercial production is still several years away. Apart from seismological work, exploratory drilling and assessment of commercial feasibility, production can be further delayed by the nature of a site and it surrounding terrain. A time span of three to five years between discovery and production is generally thought realistic. That is supported by the local experience of the Hunt Oil Company. In July 1984 Hunt announced Yemen's first commercial oil strike, but exports did not begin until three and a half years later. In addition to normal preparations on the site, Hunt also had to construct a 450 km pipeline over mountainous terrain and a marine export facility at Ras Issa on the Red Sea coast. Apart from oil, Yemen is also reported to have immense gas reserves. Indeed, the country is now rumoured to be sitting on top of the world's biggest gas 'bubble'. According to industry insiders, the discovery of Yemen's gas has come as a surprise and has led to difficulties between Hunt Oil and the Yemen government over concession rights to the unexpected find. Hunt officials, however, play down estimates of Yemen's gas reserves and sharply deny any breach with the Yemen government over concession rights. One says the two sides have now signed a joint protocol to study Yemen's gas potential and results are expected by late February 1992. Depending on the outcome of that study Yemen's income from gas could be considerable, especially from its reserves of natural gas. Liquefied natural gas is an alternative to oil in the generation of electrical power and has potential markets throughout the industrialised world. Marketing experts are said to be paying especial attention to Korea and Japan where LNG is used extensively in industry. Yemen is also said to have considerable reserves of liquid propane gas, used for domestic purposes such as cooking and heating. Though Yemen's reserves have some export potential, their primary use will be for domestic consumption thus ending the country's former dependence on imported supplies. While oil and gas are certain to be the main sources of Yemen's mineral wealth, exporters are also looking into its mining potential. That potential has long been suspected and, indeed, mining experts are now using ancient historical documents to guide their initial explorations. Preliminary reports are so far sketchy. But in addition to traces to gold and silver at traditional mining sites, geologists also hint at the possibility of uranium deposits in altogether new areas of exploration. They stress, however, that their explorations have only just begun and that much preliminary work remains to be done before any reliable statements can be made about Yemen's mining prospects. Tentative as they are, these new discoveries of Yemen's potential mineral wealth are bringing a sense of optimism to the country. Chronically one of the world's poorest nations Yemen was especially hard-hit by the Gulf war and for most of the past year its economy has suffered from steadily rising inflation and unemployment. Recent times have been hard for Yemen and its problems may continue for a while yet. But, as one oil executive put it: 'I'm bullish on the prospects'.  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "

Mr Ernesto Weber, the company's president, said yesterday the decision was part of a new policy to increase its international operations, resulting from this month's government reshuffle. According to Mr Weber the company's aim was no longer to be self-sufficient in oil but to produce at competitive cost. 'Investments should be made in terms of return and we will import or explore overseas rather than produce domestically at high cost.' The company was maintaining its heavy investment programme of Dollars 15.8bn over the next four years, with the aim of lifting production from 600,000 to 1m barrels per day mainly through deep sea drilling, he said. Brazil's consumption is 1.15m barrels per day. Petrobras, one of the largest companies in Latin America with revenues last year of Dollars 13bn, is under police investigation over an alleged network of manipulation of awarding contracts and misuse of the company's pension fund. The Brazilian Congress is due to vote this year on a constitutional amendment to end the state monopoly over production and exploration.  The Financial Times   London Page 31  "

A draft mining law was circulated this week at a conference in Beijing organised by China's Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources and the United Nations as a step towards engaging international miners more closely in China's resource development. But representatives of mining companies have given the draft a fairly lukewarm response. The requirement that foreign companies pay 20 per cent royalties on gold produced was described as 'unrealistic' by one representative. China, which has emerged as the world's largest gold consumer, has previously banned foreign involvement in the exploration and exploitation of its gold reserves; but now is anxious to tap foreign expertise and capital. Vice minister Zhang Wenju told the conference that China had decided that exploitation of its minerals resources should be speeded up to keep pace with the country's high-speed economic growth, which was nearly 13 per cent last year and is expected to exceed 10 per cent this year. Under the draft law, foreigners could explore either on their own or in partnership with Chinese organisations.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P1099 Metal Ores, NEC.

The operators say, however, that they will attempt to extend the life of the mine with a project to extract the more difficult gold sulphides. The pioneer high-altitude mine, located in the Andes close to the Bolivian border, is owned by Royal Dutch/Shell's Billiton, Northgate Exploration and Citibank. It began production in mid-1988 and produced 100,000 ounces of gold a year between 1989 and 1991 - a tenth of Chile's total output. But further exploration failed to uncover new oxide reserves and production is set to fall to 65,000 ounces this year. Choquilimpie was refused permission to continue prospecting in surrounding areas, as the mine is located in the middle of a nature reserve. Mr Jorge Chamy, Choquilimpie's general manager, said extraction of gold oxides would come to a halt at the end of the year because the current low world prices for gold made the operation unprofitable. However, he said the owners were studying new alternatives to keep their Dollars 32.7m investment alive, including the mining of gold sulphides.  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

Ebesa is a seven-company joint venture headed by Paranapanema, the world's largest tin exporter and Brazil's largest private mining company. Ebesa holds the mining rights to Bom Futuro. The court order had been issued in response to a suit filed by wildcat miners operating at the site. Under the terms of Tuesday's decision, these miners will be forced to abandon their operations. Mr Samuel A. Hanan, director-vice president of Paranapanema, said the company will demand that clandestine firms leave the area. He said individual wildcatters might be hired to work for Ebesa at the site. Some 500-600 employees would be needed when the mine was fully operational. Mr Hanan said that Ebesa would have a small plant in place within 10 days, but he could not predict when the mine would be in full production. Output should not exceed the 8,000-10,000 tonnes a year now extracted by wildcat miners. Those independent miners extracted 81,500 tonnes between 1987, when operations began, and last year.

The long-awaited exploration started with initial seismic  work commissioned by a foreign oil consortium. At the same  time, dozens of technical firms have arrived to help establish a  service centre in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province.    Oil and gas reserves in the region are expected to ease the  decades of energy shortages in East China's five provinces and  the economic giant of Shanghai.    Estimates say some 4.6 billion tons of crude oil and 2,480  billion cubic metres of natural gas are contained in the sea.  Combined, they are equivalent to 6.5 billion tons of crude oil.    The exploration, expected to span seven to eight years, will  be carried out by oil firms such as the American-based Exxon,  Texaco and Chevron; the Italian Agip; and the Netherlands' Royal  Dutch Shell.    Reserves verified so far in China's offshore areas ensure  that annual production of oil will increase from last year's 4.6  million tons to 12 million tons within four years, and continue  at 8 million tons thereafter. However, future development will  depend on the size of future discoveries.    On Tuesday, an engineering vessel began seismic work in a  block awarded to a consortium consisting of Texaco, Agip and the  Danish firm Maersk.    It is the first prospecting move by a foreign oil group  there.    As the first winning team in an international bidding  conducted by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation  (CNOOC), the three foreign firms were awarded three offshore  blocks, 400 kilometres southeast of Shanghai.    Also on Saturday, some 20 Chinese and foreign technical  firms  moved into Wenzhou, a service centre for oil operations in the  area.    The firms will provide technical services for the project.  Engineering vessels also are to be hauled to nearby ports and  heavy equipment will be installed at the bases for future use.    Other foreign oil firms that won bids are to kick off  seismic  work in the sea later this month or the next. A CNOOC official  said seismic work is likely to begin in all contract blocks  within the next two months.    The bidding for exploring the East China Sea, announced in  l992, ended in January this year with 18 contracts and  agreements signed with 17 firms from seven countries.    The bidding was for 72,800 square kilometres, divided into  20  blocks. All but two of the blocks--7,800 square  kilometres--were snapped up.    Chen, CNOOC's vice-president, last week called the  international bidding a success. ""The results are better than  expected,"" he said.    In the fourth quarter of this year, the Texaco-led group and  another group consisting of Japan Petroleum Exploration Co  (Japex) and Teikoku Oil Co are likely to drill test wells. The  two Japanese firms were awarded two blocks.    According to contracts, foreign oil firms will conduct  20,000  kilometres of seismic lines and drill 50 test wells in the sea.  They expect to use $300 million to finance the exploration.    He attributed the success partly to Chinese offshore oil  firms' good reputations.    To date, CNOOC has signed 94 contracts and agreements with  55  firms from 15 countries. Some $3.4 billion in overseas funds  have been used for oil operations in the South China Sea and the  Bohai Sea.    Chen said China did not open the sea until 1993 because more  work was needed to avoid disputes over the China-Japan ocean  boundary, unsettled in some places.    Chen did not elaborate on that diplomatic matter, but said  CNOOC had successfully handled related issues and could ensure  implementation of the bidding.    The saying is untrue that China had been reluctant to open  the sea to foreign oil firms because that site is the country's  most petroleum-rich offshore area, Chen said.    China opened the South China Sea and the Bohai Sea in the  early 1980s.    China, during explorations of the sea before the  international bidding began, had conducted 120,000 kilometres of  seismic lines and drilled 28 wells there.     "

Mr Nicholas Gay, finance director, asked investors, 'especially small shareholders, to wait for what we send them'. The defence document is expected to address several issues raised by Aberdeen in its final offer submission. These include Aberdeen's estimate that in the period from its formation in 1986 to December 31 1991 Brabant spent Pounds 14m on exploration. Brabant is expected to argue that this includes the carrying costs of assets held as a result of acquisitions. The figure quoted by Brabant is likely to be closer to Pounds 5m. The exploration company is also preparing to attack Aberdeen's overhead costs. Brabant will claim that its overheads, which have averaged 9 per cent of turnover for the last three years, compares favourably with Aberdeen's 27 per cent average.

The economic statement, delivered by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, announced abolition of the 50 per cent Australia equity requirement for new mines, and of the economic benefits test for acquiring existing mines. The government also increased the threshold of foreign investment screening to ADollars 50m (Pounds 21.4m). The new threshold applies to all mining proposals except uranium, where the limit of three mines continues. Foreign investment proposals of less than ADollars 50m, including those in the mining sector, would be automatically approved unless the project were judged against the national interest. In considering whether a mining proposal was against the national interest, the government would give weight to downstream opportunities and value-added processing. Mr Keating announced removal of export controls on iron ore and the introduction of 'life of mine' approval for mineral sands projects. The statement addressed problems for mining arising from the Aboriginal Heritage Protection Act, used to stop or delay projects.

Mr Howard Dalton, managing director for exploration and production, said 'the agreement gives the go-ahead for the development of the field,' which with probable reserves of 2,000bn cu ft is twice as big as the North Morecambe field off the west coast of the UK.

An offshore drilling and production platform will be built as well as a 42-mile subsea pipeline. The first gas is expected to flow in mid-1996. British Gas took over the Dolphin field when it acquired much of Tenneco International's international oil and gas operations in 1988.

It wants to upgrade and expand its retail and refinery businesses and increase oil exploration and production. The investments, to begin in 1994, will modernise its ageing refineries, raising capacity and improving environmental controls to meet more stringent regulations. The company's retail network will also be expanded and upgraded. Royal Dutch made the announcement in the Netherlands this week during a state visit by Argentina's President Carlos Menem.

Royal Dutch has traditionally concentrated on the refining and retail sectors of the oil industry in Argentina, rather than production. It said that political stability, pro-business government policies and economic growth had substantially increased Argentina's attractiveness. The new investment programme comes at a time of increasing competition in the once tightly-controlled oil industry. In 1991, the government deregulated the industry.

Provision of the fresh credits, apparently Y30bn (Pounds 152m) for a dam and hydroelectric power project, will follow the government's decision on Friday to end a 13-year ban on economic aid to Vietnam. The timing of the two decisions reflects Tokyo's belief that the period before Governor Bill Clinton's inauguration as president should be used to announce potentially controversial policy changes. Japanese companies have wanted the government to resume economic assistance to Iran, which they believe offers potential for lucrative contracts for infrastructure work and industrial equipment. Most Japanese car makers have sharply increased their exports to Iran this year, while Nissho Iwai, the trading house, has just won an Y8bn contract to supply oil exploration equipment. Mitsubishi Corp, another trading house, was part of an international consortium recently awarded rights to develop a natural gas field. Japan is aware that the new credits could prompt criticism from the US. The ban on assistance was maintained in sympathy with US concerns about missing military personnel in Vietnam.

'There was visible gold in many of the rocks. It was stunning. I had seen nothing like it.' He communicated that enthusiasm about his visit to the so-called Kilometre 88 gold camp in south-east Venezuela in a report distributed to clients of Burns Fry, the Canadian stockbroker that employs him. Kilometre 88 was, he suggested, 'shaping up to be the most important gold discovery in ten years'  -the most important since gold was found on the Carlin Trend in the early 1980s and triggered Nevada's gold rush. His comments were perfectly timed. Speculators who had been pouring money into Canada to feed the diamond exploration rush in the Northwest Territories were ready for something new to satisfy their appetites. Mining stock promoters were casting round for another way of lightening the wallets of nutty or naive investors while the markets were still 'hot'. The share prices of a number of small, Vancouver-quoted Canadian companies with Venezuelan connections soared as Freeman's opinions became widely circulated. Many prices doubled in a few weeks. Other small Canadian mining companies moved into the area. Controversial, high-profile promoters such as Robert Friedland and Murray Pezim are aggressively promoting their Venezuelan holdings. No wonder Mr Freeman suggests: 'Kilometre 88 will likely become the hottest exploration play in 1993'. Canadian companies swarming into Venezuela are finding the local mining laws and laws of title exceptionally complex. So they are attempting to buy existing mining concessions and driving prices up wildly. Mr Freeman says that one Venezuelan group recently talked to five Canadian companies in two days. 'The Venezuelans are asking some fancy prices for concessions now,' he says. Concessions recently priced at Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m are now being touted for Dollars 10m or more. 'The Venezuelans might not be very good miners, but they are darned good businessmen,' says Mr Freeman wryly. All this activity has produced mixed feelings in the boardrooms of companies that have been gold hunting in Venezuela for some years. While executives are happy that their foresight in choosing Venezuela is at last being recognised, they despair at the reckless claims being made and at the rocketing prices for land concessions. Mr Tony Ciali, chief executive of Monarch Resources, a London-quoted company that has been operating in Venezuela since 1987, says the rush is affecting his company's negotiations with local land owners by giving them an entirely false perspective of what their property is worth. Ironically, Monarch, which probably has the biggest single land holding in Venezuela - but some way from the Kilometre 88 camp - originally decided to restrict its activities to Venezuela because of the country's history of gold production, stable government and lack of competition from big gold companies. The country has a long history of gold mining, concentrated principally in the El Callao mining district of Guayana province but, in spite of political democracy and relative stability since 1958, there has been limited foreign investment because of an inhibitive tax regime. This included a 60 per cent corporate tax rate, which was not reduced (to 30 per cent) until last year. Most upset by the Venezuelan brouhaha is Placer Dome, one of North America's biggest gold producers, which has a joint venture property, Las Cristinas, 88 km (50 miles) south of Eldorado, near Puerto Ordaz on the Guyana border. Placer has a 70 per cent interest in Las Cristinas with the rest in the hands of the state-owned CVG (Corporation Venezolana de Guayana). Las Cristinas is in an area where about 10,000 local wildcat miners or garimpeiros worked in the 1980s, using primitive equipment that allowed the extraction of gold only from the first 15 to 30 metres of weathered bedrock. They are estimated to have removed about 1.6m troy ounces of gold. Placer has spent Dollars 2.4m to drill about 120 holes in a 400-by-200 metre grid, each hole being an average of 160 metres deep and enabling the company to collect about 7,000 metres of core samples. Burns Fry originally suggested Placer eventually would outline 'in excess of 10m gold ounces on the property,' but has backed away from that prediction recently. Mr John Willson, Placer's new chief executive, says crossly: 'We don't want to be associated with guestimates. We are very pleased with the way exploration is going (at Las Cristinas) but it is far too early for us to estimate resources there. We might have a partial resource estimate by the middle of this year. I don't want investors buying Placer Dome stock because of other people's estimates of what we have in Venezuela. When we know what resources we have there, we will tell them.' Nevertheless, you can't stop analysts speculating. Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg Securities, suggests: 'It seems likely that Las Cristinas will be developed as an underground mining operation.' He points out that some geologists believe Venezuela's Guayana shield contains about 10,000 tonnes of recoverable gold. 'Geologically, there is no doubt that the country has huge potential and in years to come could emerge to rival Australia and Canada as a leading gold producer.' However, analysts also suggest that small mining companies of the type that are at present making much fuss about their Venezuelan credentials are unlikely to win many of the potential spoils. Burns Fry's Freeman points out that the Kilometre 88 area is designated a 'wilderness area'. This means permission is required before any disturbance to the environment is permitted. The garimpeiros flouted this law and also employed traditional methods to win their gold - using mercury which devastated many areas in the Kilometre 88 region. Consequently, says Freeman, environmental law is enforced by the National Guard, 'so violators are faced by a man carrying not a clip-board but a machine-gun'. Venezuelan law also requires a number of reports to be filed regularly with the government and simply fulfilling these obligations takes time and money in Venezuela. So, 'when added to the environmental restrictions, it makes acquiring properties in that country a much more tricky proposition than, say, getting into the US'. Mr Ian Austin, Placer Dome's chief financial officer, goes even further. He suggests that only big mining companies will be able to develop gold mines in Venezuela because only big companies will be able to offer responsible environmental programmes.

Noto, 55, takes over the reins at Mobil on March 1, when veteran chairman and chief executive Allen Wallace retires. Unlike other US oil industry chiefs, Noto has spent most of his working life outside of the US. Mobil is already one of the most internationally active of the big oil groups. Given the diminishing returns from exploration in the US and the high costs of refining there, most oil groups have their sights set on investment overseas, and Mobil is no exception. Noto, whose parents emigrated to the US from Sicily, is a native of Brooklyn and New Jersey. After joining Mobil in 1962, he held senior marketing and planning jobs in Japan and Italy before running Mobil's operations in Saudi Arabia. During those years, he gained a reputation as both a skilled diplomat and tough businessman. It was Wallace, with Mobil for 41 years, who brought Noto back to the US in 1985 and prepared him for the top job.

The moves will cost Chevron $25 million to $30 million in charges in the first  quarter of 1990, primarily for employees' severance packages, but will  eventually save the company $140 million to $160 million a year in salaries and  operating costs, Chevron spokesman Michael W. Libbey said from the company's  San Francisco headquarters.    Analysts generally applauded the planned restructuring by the nation's  third-largest energy company, whose financial performance has trailed that of  its major competitors due in part to high costs, low efficiencies and top-heavy  staff.    ""Clearly, management now sees that they need to restructure and that there's  tremendous potential value to be unlocked,"" said Frederick P. Leuffer, an  industry analyst with C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York and one  of Chevron's tougher critics.    Chevron's restructuring of its U.S. exploration and production operation is  part of a longstanding industry trend to streamline such operations and focus  more attention overseas. Unocal Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Mobil Oil  Corp. and British Petroleum have already undertaken similar downsizing.    Chevron's moves may signal disenchantment with domestic oil prospects in light  of its frustration in trying to produce oil off the coast of Santa Barbara  County through the Point Arguello project, analysts said.    Chevron, the lead partner in a consortium of 18 oil companies, took a  $445-million charge in the fourth quarter of 1989 on its share of a total  $2-billion investment in the project, which sits idle as county officials  debate how to transport the project's oil. Partly as a result of the charge,  Chevron's 1989 earnings plummeted to $251 million from nearly $1.8 billion in  1988.    It is also unlikely that Chevron will be allowed to drill any time soon in the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where it has a large interest, because of  heightened environmental concerns in the wake of the Exxon Valdez and Orange  County oil tanker spills.    After Tuesday's announcement, Chevron's stock fell 62.5 cents a share to $69.25  on the New York Stock Exchange.    The restructuring, which grew out of a study completed this month, is part of a  continuing effort to improve Chevron's stock price and its return to  shareholders. Some details:    * Between 800 and 1,000 jobs will be cut this year, half through sale of  assets. That includes middle and senior management jobs, as well as all 450  positions at Chevron's exploration and production offices in San Ramon, Calif.  In subsequent years, more jobs will be cut through attrition, early retirements  and other programs.    * Chevron will accelerate its sales of less-profitable oil and gas properties  in the United States, auctioning off more than $700 million worth of properties  in the next two years, or about 1,000 of Chevron's 1,700 fields. The fields,  many acquired in the Gulf Oil merger in 1984, represent only about 11% of  Chevron's total daily production of oil and gas, Libbey said. Chevron sold  about $210 million in assets in 1988 and 1989.    * The company will eliminate several layers of management, phase out three  regional offices in San Ramon, Houston and New Orleans and consolidate  operations under seven business units accountable for their own profits and  losses directly to company headquarters. Also, production operations now  managed in Ventura will be moved to Bakersfield.    The move should cut Chevron's high cost of producing oil. In 1989, it spent  about $6.40 to find and produce a barrel of oil, more than any of its major  competitors. The restructuring, scheduled to be completed by Oct. 1, will help  Chevron achieve its goal in the next three to five years of cutting that cost  to $5.25 per barrel in 1990 dollars, comparable to the costs of its  competitors, said Leonard Porter, Chevron's Western regional general manager  for production.    Chevron's Chairman Kenneth T. Derr is scheduled to discuss details of the  restructuring in meetings with financial analysts in New York today.    Chevron produced about 2.6 million barrels of oil and gas a day in 1989,  equally divided between U.S. and foreign production.    The restructuring does not appear to be a reaction to Pennzoil Co.'s  acquisition of an 8.8% stake in Chevron last year. Since that purchase, Chevron  has sued Pennzoil and strengthened its defenses against a possible takeover.

The Canadian-built facilities are located in the Castellanos  bed and use a system of zinc precipitation, which is widely used  in the international gold industry, to extract the mineral.    According to mining authorities, this mine opens new  possibilities for Cuba to diversify its economy. In addition to  Castellanos, Cuba has gold deposits in the Isle of Youth  (Delita), in the central province of Villa Clara (El Descanso),  and in the eastern provinces of Camaguey (Jobabo) and Holguin  (Aguas Claras).    The most promising of those gold deposits is the one located  in Delita. Experts have concluded, however, that this is where  gold extractions will be more difficult because the mineral is  accompanied by large amounts of arsenic, which is definitely an  undesirable element.    Cuba is divided into 37 areas for geological prospects. More  than 20 contracts have been signed with foreign investors,  particularly from Canada, for the exploration of solid minerals.     "

The deposit, which lies about 195km south-east of Mount Isa, will be mined at first by open-pit methods. However, during this initial eight-month period, Placer plans to develop an underground operation, which it says should have a 10-year life. The mine is due to come into operation in July 1995. Over the total mining period, therefore, average annual production is estimated to be 29,000 tonnes of copper and 37,000 oz of gold. Total production over the mine's life would be around 324,000 tonnes of copper and 416,000 oz of gold, with a gross metal value of ADollars 1.2bn. Life-of-mine cash costs are projected to be 63 US cents per pound of copper, including gold credits, Placer said. Shares in Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's largest mining companies, gained 3 cents to ADollars 8.44 yesterday, after the group confirmed that early-stage exploration work on the Philippines-controlled island of Mindanao, has found copper/gold mineralisation.

A research team, headed by senior geologist Huang Zhongxin,  under the Changqing oil-prospecting administration of the basin  came to the conclusion based on a systematic study of a large  amount of hydrogeological materials and other related  information amassed over the past four decades.    According to them, the basin has a water-bearing area of  144,000 sq [square] km, with total reserves of 11,400 billion cu  m [cubic meters], of which, 6,960 billion cu m are fresh water.  This is equivalent to 267 times the volume of China's largest  freshwater lake, Poyang Lake, in east China's Jiangxi Province.    Most of the water-bearing strata lie 500 m to 600 m below  the  surface, but some of them, especially in Shaanxi Province, are  no more than 100 m below the surface.    The scientists believe that the development of such rich  water resources will not affect oil and natural gas prospecting  work in the basin.    They add that the exploration of the water resources will  play an important role in helping solve the problem of  industrial and drinking water supply and underground flooding of  oilfields in the area.

The order comes less than a month after the explosion at Guadalajara that killed 200 people. The company has been widely blamed for the disaster and, during the past couple of weeks, has been subject to sustained and bitter criticism. Few details of the plans are known, but they are likely to lead to a greater decentralisation of Pemex's operations, and further demarcation between its lines of businesses. Local managers may assume greater responsibility for operations. It is expected more services will be contracted out to private companies. Pemex, and Mexico's oil reserves, will remain under full state ownership, and foreign oil companies will still not be allowed to explore for oil in Mexico, nor build and operate refineries. Under advice from McKinsey, the US consultancy, Pemex has already been divided into five profit and cost centres - exploration and production, petrochemicals, refining, sales, and construction. It is intended that the accounting price of trade between the centres be based on a formula linked to international prices. However, this new structure is meeting resistance within Pemex, and is not thought to be as running as smoothly as the government would like.  The Financial Times   International Page 7  "

We are about 90 travelers -- American, Japanese, German, Swiss, Australian,  Canadian, Brazilian and British -- temporarily disembarked from a ship being  billed as the world's ""first environment-friendly expedition ship"" and the  possible ""model of non-polluting ships to come."" We are on the inaugural voyage  of Salen Lindblad Cruising's brand-new Frontier Spirit, a 164-passenger vessel  that left Guam for Papua New Guinea on Nov. 8.    We learn we are carrying the aspects of civilization that interest the  Micronesians most -- cold Coca-Colas, filter-tipped cigarettes and an engineer  who can repair their broken generator so they can again watch videos on the VCR  attached to the community's one television set.    But they would probably be unimpressed, should they venture below deck, by our  ship's state-of-the-art systems for disposing of garbage without spoiling the  environment, because garbage is something these people don't have.    They use everything the sea or others bring to their shores. Remains of crashed  World War II Japanese fighter planes make shelters for dogs and chickens;  Japanese plastic fishing floats, cut in half, are handy as food dishes for  chickens and pigs; washed-up bottles store rainwater or make ornamental borders  around family graves, and pieces of plywood and corrugated metal are  incorporated into the walls of their thatch-roof houses.    Such is not the case with cruise ships, however, even luxurious expedition  vessels filled with passengers passionate about saving the environment.    Aboard the Frontier Spirit, however, a corner of consciousness has been turned.  Instead of bingo, we have lectures on identifying sea birds or how a coral reef  is formed. Instead of floor shows or dancing after dinner, we may watch  National Geographic videos about sharks or life on atolls.    And no future archeologist is likely to find any clues we passed by here on the  way south toward the delicate and threatened ecosystem of Antarctica.    Frontier Spirit was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Kobe, Japan, the  first expedition ship to be created in 26 years. Reflecting the new attitude of  ecologically aware tourism, it carries one crew member who is solely  responsible for separating and processing shipboard garbage into  environmentally acceptable components.    In one machine, glass is smashed into tiny fragments that are sifted and  released into the sea, where they settle on the sand to be additionally  pulverized by nature. Paper is compressed into small packets and burned in the  incinerator.    Another machine shreds and grinds metal into easy-to-store fragments that are  held in a special compartment with compacted plastics to be returned to  disembarkation ports.    Food garbage is compacted into small bales, with all liquid removed, and what  can be burned is disposed of in the incinerator. The rest is stored in an  air-tight refrigerated compartment until it can be off-loaded at a port that  can handle such garbage.    There is an oil separator in the ship's bilge system that removes the waste  oil, which is then burned in the incinerator, while the water is returned to  the bilge. The ship uses only marine-diesel or gas-oil, cleaner fuels than the  heavy-duty bunker or sea oil that most ships use.    A fresh-water vacuum toilet system throughout the vessel requires less water to  operate, according to the cruise line, than usual shipboard systems. The waste  is transferred to a sewage treatment plant, where it is mixed with  hydrochloride before being discharged into the sea.    Aside from its waste-disposal features, the Frontier Spirit carries a higher  ice-class rating (an ability to cut through five feet of ice) than any other  expedition ship currently in service, according to veteran Capt.

We are about 90 travelers -- American, Japanese, German, Swiss, Australian,  Canadian, Brazilian and British -- temporarily disembarked from a ship being  billed as the world's ""first environment-friendly expedition ship"" and the  possible ""model of non-polluting ships to come."" We are on the inaugural voyage  of Salen Lindblad Cruising's brand-new Frontier Spirit, a 164-passenger vessel  that left Guam for Papua New Guinea on Nov. 8.    We learn we are carrying the aspects of civilization that interest the  Micronesians most -- cold Coca-Colas, filter-tipped cigarettes and an engineer  who can repair their broken generator so they can again watch videos on the VCR  attached to the community's one television set.    But they would probably be unimpressed, should they venture below deck, by our  ship's state-of-the-art systems for disposing of garbage without spoiling the  environment, because garbage is something these people don't have.    They use everything the sea or others bring to their shores. Remains of crashed  World War II Japanese fighter planes make shelters for dogs and chickens;  Japanese plastic fishing floats, cut in half, are handy as food dishes for  chickens and pigs; washed-up bottles store rainwater or make ornamental borders  around family graves, and pieces of plywood and corrugated metal are  incorporated into the walls of their thatch-roof houses.    Such is not the case with cruise ships, however, even luxurious expedition  vessels filled with passengers passionate about saving the environment.    Aboard the Frontier Spirit, however, a corner of consciousness has been turned.  Instead of bingo, we have lectures on identifying sea birds or how a coral reef  is formed. Instead of floor shows or dancing after dinner, we may watch  National Geographic videos about sharks or life on atolls.    And no future archeologist is likely to find any clues we passed by here on the  way south toward the delicate and threatened ecosystem of Antarctica.    Frontier Spirit was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Kobe, Japan, the  first expedition ship to be created in 26 years. Reflecting the new attitude of  ecologically aware tourism, it carries one crew member who is solely  responsible for separating and processing shipboard garbage into  environmentally acceptable components.    In one machine, glass is smashed into tiny fragments that are sifted and  released into the sea, where they settle on the sand to be additionally  pulverized by nature. Paper is compressed into small packets and burned in the  incinerator.    Another machine shreds and grinds metal into easy-to-store fragments that are  held in a special compartment with compacted plastics to be returned to  disembarkation ports.    Food garbage is compacted into small bales, with all liquid removed, and what  can be burned is disposed of in the incinerator. The rest is stored in an  air-tight refrigerated compartment until it can be off-loaded at a port that  can handle such garbage.    There is an oil separator in the ship's bilge system that removes the waste  oil, which is then burned in the incinerator, while the water is returned to  the bilge. The ship uses only marine-diesel or gas-oil, cleaner fuels than the  heavy-duty bunker or sea oil that most ships use.    A fresh-water vacuum toilet system throughout the vessel requires less water to  operate, according to the cruise line, than usual shipboard systems. The waste  is transferred to a sewage treatment plant, where it is mixed with  hydrochloride before being discharged into the sea.    Aside from its waste-disposal features, the Frontier Spirit carries a higher  ice-class rating (an ability to cut through five feet of ice) than any other  expedition ship currently in service, according to veteran Capt. Heinz Aye. It  is also the largest expedition ship, according to Aye, who has made 59  Antarctic cruises and two transits of the Northwest Passage.

This follows the announcement earlier this year that the mine would probably need R950m (Pounds 150m) in new capital on top of the R2bn already invested if it were to become commercially viable. According to the company, preliminary sampling has revealed unusual variability in the grade of the reef. In consequence, the mine will require an additional 2,000m of reef development to explore the area further and determine whether there is in fact an exploitable high grade channel within the main ore body. This development is expected to be completed by December 1995. As a result of the move, the mine's workforce will be scaled down from 3,200 to 1,200 although Gengold plans to offer most of the workers alternative employment on other mines in the group. Gencor, Gengold's parent company, has agreed to underwrite the additional exploration at the cost of R12m a month. However this excludes financing costs and Gengold says it will seek further consultation with Oryx's bankers. Meanwhile, Gengold says that the initial R979m in interest-free loans provided by the mine's major shareholders - Gencor, mining house Anglo-American, investment group Genbel and financial group Sanlam - will be capitalised in the near future.

The company is interested in stakes in two newly-created transmission companies and eight regional distribution companies. Final bids are due on November 18, with stakes likely to be awarded soon afterwards. The Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.37bn) sale of Gas del Estado is one of Argentina's largest privatisations. Gas del Estado has a 6,500-mile main transmission network - which is to be split into two companies covering the north and south of the country - and 30,000 miles of distribution pipeline, to be split into eight regional companies. It has 4m customers, and total sales of 600bn cubic feet a year. British Gas already has two exploration licences and interests in four of Argentina's producing oil and gas fields. British Gas is keen to boost profits from its Global Gas business to offset the effect of falling earnings from its UK supply business, where regulators are forcing price cuts and accelerating competition. It already has distribution projects in Turkey, Egypt and Indonesia, and a 5 per cent stake in Verbundnetz Gas, the former east German gas transmission company, and stakes in two German regional gas distribution companies.

Mr Donald Driver, Plateau's chairman, said the bid continued to be 'without merit'. He added: 'Plateau shareholders are concerned about the quality, not the quantity, of Kingstream's shares.' He pointed out that Kingstream's latest accounts were heavily qualified by its auditors on the grounds of a deficiency of working capital. 'This was in spite of Kingstream borrowing money from its shareholders and pledging certain of its major assets as security. I can see no merit in anybody accepting shares of this doubtful value.' Mr Driver said Kingstream's shares had dropped by more than 15 per cent since the first offer on April 13. Kingstream said it was increasing its offer to three of its ordinary shares for every 10 Plateau ordinary to take account of the increased value of the UK company following the agreement for Plateau to sell its interest in the Mhondoro joint venture in Zimbabwe to Delta Gold for shares worth more than Pounds 1.5m.

0,FT944-8283 ,"FT944-8283 _AN-EKUDAACTFT 941121   FT  21 NOV 94 / Long distance lines: Move to expand the mobile phone market      By ALAN CANE   Imagine a fleet of dirigibles - steerable airships - in the upper atmosphere collecting and redirecting telephone calls around the world. Implausible as it may sound, it was one option considered by Motorola, the world's largest portable phone maker, in its search for ways to develop a mobile phone service to extend from the wilds of Antarctica to the Kalahari desert. Motorola opted, instead, for satellites, and Iridium - the consortium it leads - is now the front-runner in an expensive and technically complex race that has been joined by seven consortia. What they envisage is a high-quality service over low-cost pocket telephones offering calls at a cost of Dollars 3 or less a minute and serving both cellular phone users and those without access to cellular systems. Cellular mobile phone services are well established in the developed world, with 100m-200m cellular phones expected to be in use by 2000. But cellular systems can only cover localised areas. Calls beyond their network must be routed via earth-stations through geostationary satellites that hover some 22,000m above the Earth's surface, where, from the ground, they appear stationary. There are large areas of the world without access to the telephone exchanges, lines, switching capacity and administrative capability to run cellular phone services. Mobile phone users can still gain access to geostationary satellites in these areas, using their own portable equipment  -and the battlefield reports during the Gulf war bear witness to the quality of such services. But the calls are expensive, at between Dollars 5 and Dollars 10 a minute, and the equipment needed to make and receive them weighs more than a lap-top computer, fills a suitcase and costs Dollars 25,000. The key to the new satellite services is advances in microelectronics which have made it possible to cram an entire earth station, capable of transmitting and receiving signals from up to 6,000 miles above the Earth's surface, into a package no larger than a conventional pocket phone. Iridium and its competitors, will launch low-earth orbit satellites (Leo) that will circle the globe at a height of about 2,000km, and medium-earth orbit satellites (Meo) at about 10,000km to handle the traffic. Iridium has already built six of its planned 73 satellites and expects to launch the first in 1997. Last week, Odyssey, a joint venture between TRW, the US aerospace manufacturer, and Teleglobe, a Canadian telecommunications operator, announced that they were joining the race. In addition, Globalstar, developed by Loral and Qualcomm, Ellipsat, Constellation Communications and American Mobile Satellite Corporation, are contenders from North America. These US contenders were last week submitting applications for the necessary licences to the US Federal Communications Commission. Between them, they will have to raise close to Dollars 10bn in debt and equity. Only Iridium is so far fully subscribed; having raised Dollars 1.6bn in equity, it is now looking for a further Dollars 1.8bn in loans. Odyssey, the newcomer, which has a guaranteed Dollars 150m from TRW and Teleglobe, is seeking a further Dollars 850m in equity and Dollars 1bn in loans. Outside the US, only Inmarsat, a London-based, international consortium, has announced plans to set up a global mobile phone network, called Project P. A pioneer of satellite communications, Inmarsat first offered maritime voice and data services, using a geostationary satellite system, in 1982. It now provides satellite communications to some 40,000 customers in shipping and aerospace. Inmarsat's owners - leading telecommunications organisations in some 75 countries - have until December 16 to decide whether to put up the Dollars 1bn the organisation needs for the first phase of the Dollars 2.8bn Project P. Inmarsat, like the other consortia, plans to act as wholesaler, selling to 'customers' who will distribute the capacity worldwide. These distributors are likely to be existing telecommunications companies such as Vodafone, the UK cellular phone group, which will become Globalstar's franchisee for countries where it operates cellular networks. The service will still be more expensive than conventional mobile telephony but the target customer is the global business traveller prepared to pay a premium for a service that will be available anywhere. Other customers are expected to include governments, small vessels, public and private emergency services and users in areas suffering from poor communications. Each consortia has its own, jealously guarded set of estimates on the likely rewards from this market. Most calculations, however, are tied to the likely population of mobile phones. Mr John Windolth, a spokesman for Iridium, says that if the consortia had 1m subscribers for its voice service by 2002, 'We would be very profitable'. Mr Patrick McDougal, a spokesman for Inmarsat, believes its service could break even within three years of its launch in 1999. The technology used may prove significant in determining the price of the service, with Iridium and Globalstar planning to use Leos and Odyssey and Inmarsat planning to use Meos. Leo operators need more satellites to cover the ground, but provide higher transmission quality. Meo operators promise lowest cost and technological risk. But adequate finance and management commitment are likely to prove far more conclusive than earth orbits in sorting the winners from the losers. And the only real certainty at present is that the rivalry between the consortia will be intense. Analysts believe it is unlikely the market will be able to support more than two competitive services by 2000.  --------------------------------       THE MAIN CONTENDERS  --------------------------------            GLOBALSTAR             INMARSAT             IRIDIUM             ODESSEY  --------------------------------   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Pre-tax profit climbed from Pounds 4.42m to Pounds 5.19m. Turnover was static at Pounds 43.4m, but improving margins led to an increase in operating profit to Pounds 3.64m (Pounds 3.31m). Mr Paul Humphreys, finance director, said the group received an unexpected Pounds 480,000 dividend from a long-standing investment in Moray Petroleum, an oil exploration company. This was unlikely to recur in coming years. The streamlining of the vehicle painting, wood stains, marine painting and paint distribution operations, with the creation of a paints division, would lead to further cost savings, he added. Mr Humphreys said the group had net cash reserves of Pounds 10m, and was seeking a suitable acquisition to give the business 'a third leg', possibly in the engineering sector. Although sales were flat, profitability at Granyte Surface Coatings, the wood stains and lacquers offshoot, jumped 25 per cent while Kennedy Wagstaff, the textile machinery company, moved back into the black.

He discovered that John Major's  administration considers the issue of negotiations with the  Menem administration on the issue of oil around the Malvinas  Island ""convenient but not indispensable"" and that the United  Kingdom is ""ready"" to lift the arms embargo imposed on Argentina  since the Malvinas war.    CLARIN talked with Di Tella, who was staying at the  Argentine  Embassy residence in Paris and will arrive back in Buenos Aires  this morning.    [CLARIN] What are the results of your meeting with Foreign  and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary Douglas Hurd?    [Di Tella] I had a long meeting with him and ended up  clarifying two important issues: negotiations on oil  exploration, which will have a busy agenda, and the issue of  relations with Chile. It was established that we will cooperate.  They consider British-Argentine negotiations ""convenient but not  indispensable,"" and we consider them ""indispensable."" The two  countries have agreed that it is ""convenient.""    [CLARIN] Has Hurd offered you seismic prospecting results or  told you how much oil there is in the islands?    [Di Tella] They have not been very explicit and they have  not  given me any seismic prospecting work. They assured us that they  are still not sure how much oil there is in the area.    [CLARIN] Did he reproach you for Argentina's ""theft"" of the  seismic prospecting carried out on orders of the island's  government through an Argentine ghost company?    [Di Tella] They did not complain. On the other hand, it was  not a ghost company but a YPF [Government Oil Deposits]  subsidiary. I cannot recall the name of the company now.    [CLARIN] Did you establish an agenda to discuss the oil  situation?    [Di Tella] There is ""a verbal agreement."" But never before  was the ""convenience"" of negotiating the issue of oil  exploration mentioned so explicitly. A technical team will meet  in April to discuss these questions.    [CLARIN] Great Britain's problem is that insurance companies  refuse to insure ""off shore"" [preceding two words in English]  explorations in conflict zones such as the area around the  Malvinas Islands. In the back of their minds they have the ghost  of what happened with Kuwait's oil wells, which were set on fire  by the Iraqis. How will Argentina take advantage of this  situation in negotiations for the Malvinas Islands?    [Di Tella] Argentina can create serious juridical problems  for Great Britain in the South Atlantic. We are going to do just  that. The British Government is at a point where it must discuss  the issue of oil exploration with us. Our ""warning notes"" on the  matter have worried companies in the area.    [CLARIN] Are you using that as a future threat?    [Di Tella] It is not a threat. That is life...If you push a  door bell you will hear a noise...I will take every legal step  possible to achieve our objective.    [CLARIN] Did you discuss the Argentine Government's  apprehensions about British interference in Argentine-Chilean  relations?    [Di Tella] That was one of the main reasons for my trip and  my interest in seeing Hurd. It was one of the topics on our  agenda. I talked to him about the excellent status of  Argentine-Chilean relations and the need we have for Great  Britain to help consolidate it.    [CLARIN] What did Hurd say about Margaret Thatcher's visit  to  Chile in the next few days?    [Di Tella] Hurd told me that Mrs. Thatcher is going to Chile  because ""she feels like it."" Maggie has ""never"" (in English),  and least of all now, accepted pressure from anyone. She is  promoting her ""Memories"" and has made more than 3 million pounds  from it. For her the monetary issue is very important. She  cannot be pressured, least of all by John Major's government.    [CLARIN] Why will Hurd travel to Malvinas if  British-Argentine relations are so good?    [Di Tella] Hurd simply told me: ""I have been in the post for  five years and never visited the islands. Besides you are very  active diplomatically and you visit us every three months."" I  am highly encouraged to see that my ""charming [preceding word in  English] operation"" is yielding these results.    [CLARIN] According to British sources, the Major government  is ready to sell arms to Argentina.    [Di Tella] They can offer them. We do not have any problems.  We want an end to the arms embargo. In this visit to London I  had the impression that the arms embargo issue will soon be a  thing of the past.     "

This follows last month's announcement of its merger proposals with Brabant Resources, which were rejected. Houston-based Bellwether Exploration has said that in December it approached the UK-quoted company with merger proposals on the basis of 3.75 Aberdeen shares for each of its own. Based on an exchange price of Dollars 1.5395 to the pound, and Bellwether's share price of 62 1/2 cents, the proposal values each Aberdeen share at 10 3/4 p. Mr Darby Sere, chief executive of Bellwether, said the announcement was made in light of the almost-50 per cent rise in Aberdeen shares since the approach had first been made. He stressed the synergies between the two groups, which both own and operate North American assets. If an eventual offer succeeds, then the enlarged company would lose the USM quotation. Bellwether, an oil and gas exploration and production company, is traded on Nasdaq in the US. It has a market value of about Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 7.5m) and is 80 per cent held by three UK institutions and Torchmark, the US insurance company. The Bellwether proposal was believed to be somewhat different from the tentative arrangements discussed in the earlier informal meetings.   Companies:-  Aberdeen Petroleum.

0,FT942-6763 ,"FT942-6763 _AN-EE2AAABVFT 940528   FT  28 MAY 94 / Hunters harpooned: The whales might finally be saved      By DAMIAN FRASER   The decision by the International Whaling Commission to set up a sanctuary around Antarctica is being hailed as a victory for the green movement's whale diplomacy. 'This is the end of deep-sea whale hunting,' said Gordon Shepherd of the World Wide Fund for Nature. 'The Japanese whale industry is dead.' The sanctuary, to be monitored bu Australia, would link up with an existing safe area in the Indian Ocean, to protect about 80 per cent of the world's surviving whales, and indefinitely put off-limits some 750,000 minke whales that Japan says are legitimate commercial targets. At the annual commission meeting in Puerta Vallarta, Mexico, attended by representatives from the industrialised world and international environmental groups, Japan was the only country to vote against the sanctuary, with Norway, which does not hunt in the Antarctic, refusing to vote. Japan is now threatening to withdraw from the commission, which in principle would allow it to resume hunting. The triumph of the environmentalists is partly symbolic, since commercial whaling is prohibited under a moratorium in effect for eight years. While the commission is considering lifting the ban, most observers believe a decision will not be made for years. Nevertheless, the sanctuary is viewed by the greens as an essential safety net, amid signs that the moratorium is 'leaking'. Norway has recently resumed limited commercial minke whale hunting off its coastline in the north-east Atlantic, while Japan kills about 300 minke whales a year in the Antarctic for 'research' purposes - allowed under the moratorium. Activists believe that Japan will give up research killings in the Antarctic sanctuary now there is no hope of commercial hunting. The sanctuary may have wider implications. Some campaigners see the 23-1 vote as a vindication of their tough tactics, which included threatening the Caribbean supporters of Japan's position with a tourism boycott. 'We can definitely learn from this and apply it to other animals,' says Kate O'Connell, an environmentalist based in Colombia. The governments of non-whaling countries such as the US, the UK, France and Germany are happy to go along with the environmentalists because of the domestic political credit they earn. 'They see this as a cheap way to buy a green image,' says Milton Freeman, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta, Canada. 'Who could possibly be against a whale sanctuary?' Such attitudes infuriate Japan and Norway, which stress that the charter of the commission requires it to base decisions on scientific grounds, and regulate whaling so as to provide for 'the optimum utilisation of the whale resources'. They say there is no scientific basis for a comprehensive sanctuary, since endangered whales such as the blue whale, are already protected, and will continue to be protected whatever happens to the minkes. Having lost the battle over the sanctuary, Japan and Norway are pushing to replace the moratorium with catch quotas for minkes, the only whale species not endangered. Quotas would allow the Japanese to hunt on a limited scale for minke whales off its own coast, and take political pressure off Norway for resuming whaling unilaterally in the north-east Atlantic. They are seeking support from the commission, whose scientific committee has developed a mathematical model, known as the Revised Management Programme, to calculate how many whales of a species can be caught in a year without threatening survival. But the commission is in no hurry to implement the model, and the non-whaling countries would like to avoid a politically sensitive vote on the moratorium. The stalling game was given a boost by reports this year that the former Soviet Union under-reported killings of blue and other endangered whales. One ship caught 7,207 humpback whales and 1,433 blue whales during a period of the 1960s, and not 152 and 156 as reported, according to Alexei Yablokov, President Boris Yeltsin's adviser on ecology. Environmentalists said proof of Soviet misreporting would reduce any catch quotas agreed - although the commission has said its impact would be minimal. More important, environmentalists argue that observation and monitoring of catches has to be tight to prevent further cheating. With one minke whale worth up to Dollars 50,000, the temptation to misreport is considerable. As well as doubting official reports of Soviet kills, scientists have also begun to question estimates of stocks. The Norwegians reckon there are 87,000 minke whales in the north-east Atlantic, giving a catch quota of 290, according to the model. Dr Justin Cooke, a scientific consultant who helped develop the commission's mathematical model, reckons they are 53,000 minkes, which would give a quota of just one minke a year. Anti-whaling nations say that debates such as these could hold up the implementation of a quota scheme for off-shore hunting forever. Even if there is acceptance of the numbers, there is the problem of how whales are killed. The UK objects to whale hunting because of the slow and painful death of a harpooned whale. As a European commissioner put it: 'The point about whales is you get an enormous response - we received 60,000 postcards backing the sanctuary.' The fact that whale meat is regarded as a delicacy in Japan does not seem to matter.   Countries:-  NOZ  Norway, West Europe.     JPZ  Japan, Asia.

President Carlos Menem cancelled plans to attend a military parade, apparently for fear of being jeered by pro-military right wingers. He chose to attend Mass at the national shrine of Lujan. However, former combatants invited to join the president boycotted the service, claiming he was using it for political purposes. The bishop officiating at Mass said the invasion was to 'safeguard constitutional order.' Mr Menem said: 'Today is a day of reflection and homage to all those who fell defending national territory.' The only military parade was held in the Patagonian city of Ro Gallegos, 2,100 km south of Buenos Aires and on the same latitude as Port Stanley, the Falklands capital. There, Mr Antonio Gonzalez, defence minister, said Argentina would eventually win sovereignty over the islands through 'tireless diplomatic efforts.' Meanwhile, the UK embassy in Buenos Aires denied that the islands' government would issue seismic survey licences for oil exploration, as announced by the chief executive of the Falklands government this week. 'The British government is committed to giving no surprises and intends to stick to this,' an official said. The islands have legislation enabling them to market exploration licences, but rules are still being studied in London and will only be enacted after consultation with Argentina.

0,FT932-9438 ,"FT932-9438 _AN-DEMB5AG5FT 930513   FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (4): Exporter will join the importers - Energy shortages loom for an oil-rich country      By VICTOR MALLET      THE INDONESIAN archipelago is famously rich in sources of energy   oil, gas, coal and geothermal and hydroelectric power - but the country faces some hard decisions about where to invest the billions of dollars that will be needed to provide more fuel for its economic development in the next century. Oil exports have financed Indonesia's rapid industrialisation since the 1960s, and Indonesia has been a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries since 1962. But within the next 10 years or so Indonesia is likely to become a net importer of oil as domestic consumption grows and production falls. Latest projections from the central bank in Jakarta show the net current account contribution of oil dropping to Dollars 930m in the 1993/94 financial year from Dollars 2.19bn in 1992/93. Oil output last year fell to about 1.5m barrels a day, six per cent below the level in 1991. In recent years there has been plenty of exploration by the scores of oil companies operating in Indonesia, but few substantial discoveries. Whereas the first wave of contracts awarded in the 1960s and 1970s proved to be remarkably successful - about a dozen out of 55 are still estimated to be profitably producing today - the more recent results have been miserable; of more than 130 contracts agreed since 1976, only one is thought to be both producing and making a profit. 'Clearly the industry has been spectacularly unsuccessful over the last 18 years,' said an oil company executive. It is rare in any oil-producing country to find a foreign oil company which would be so rash as to declare itself satisfied with the profit-sharing conditions of the host government, but there does appear to be a genuine concern about the high costs and low rewards of operating in Indonesia - a concern acknowledged by the government's decision to improve incentives three times in the last five years. The latest round of incentives announced in September last year were aimed principally at encouraging companies to look for gas and to explore for hydrocarbons in deep water and in remote areas, but the response from the oil companies has been unenthusiastic. A few companies closed their offices in Indonesia last year or reduced staff, and others are looking with renewed interest at other prospects in Vietnam, China, India, the Philippines and the former Soviet Union. Existing oil producers want Indonesia to scrap its 'ring-fencing' of production sharing contracts, a change which would allow them to offset costs in new exploration areas against their earnings but would also unfairly disadvantage oil companies without any current production in Indonesia. For Indonesia, the benefits of such a step - which the authorities have shown no sign of taking - would be to promote the search for oil and gas in eastern areas hitherto only thinly explored. With wells in remote, deep water areas costing up to Dollars 30m each, it is hardly surprising that about 80 per cent of exploration at present takes place in existing production areas, mostly in the west. Gas is as crucial as oil to the wellbeing of the Indonesian economy. The country is the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), shipping about Dollars 4bn worth a year to Japan and other countries, and the government is keen to promote domestic use of natural gas to reduce local demand for oil and so free more crude for export. The largest known deposit of gas in Indonesia - and south-east Asia - is the Natuna field in the south China sea. Its size presents both opportunities and problems. Pertamina, the state oil and gas company, and Exxon of the US have yet to finalise terms on developing the giant field, and even when they do they will face daunting technical and financial challenges before being able to make the first LNG shipments eight years later. Natuna, with an estimated 45 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, represents about half of Indonesia's known reserves. But 70 per cent of the corrosive mixture to be extracted from the wells is carbon dioxide, requiring costly separation and re-injection facilities and special corrosion resistant materials. About 700,000 tonnes of steel would be required for the offshore facilities, and the valves and fittings for the treatment platforms would be among the largest available. The total cost of the project is likely to be more than Dollars 16bn. The more mundane business of developing smaller gas deposits for domestic power stations and other consumers is less daunting, but not without its own obstacles; there are at least 79 known fields too small to be exploited for export. Oil companies are sometimes reluctant to admit they have found gas because they fear they will not be able to develop it profitably. The French company Total has made finds off Borneo, which may help to extend the life of Indonesian LNG exports, but some scattered gas deposits found elsewhere years ago have never been developed because they are too small for LNG and too far from domestic consumers to justify the construction of a pipeline. The Indonesian government is struggling to develop a coherent domestic gas distribution policy, but Pertamina is said to be unwilling to give up too much influence to Perum Gas Negara (PGN), the state gas distributor which is expected to develop gas transmission systems. Indonesia has complex bureaucracy as well as complex geology. 'It's becoming urgent because of the high demand,' said a senior PGN official. 'It's very urgent and I hope that this will be fully understood by all the bureaucrats in the government.' Some steps, however, have been taken. After more than a year's delay, a pipeline from an Arco-operated field off east Java is being built to supply a new power station at Gresik near Surabaya. Future projects may include pipelines from south Sumatra gas fields south to energy-hungry west Java and north to the huge Duri field operated by Caltex - to replace oil currently burned in making steam which is injected into the reservoir to heat and lift the heavy crude. Another strategy adopted to conserve oil has been to increase the domestic retail price of fuel - which had been below world prices. Most petroleum product prices were raised by more than 20 per cent in January, and although the authorities are concerned about the inflationary effects of the increase, further rises may follow in coming years to suppress growing demand and promote the use of gas. The man responsible for the sensitive task of directing energy policy is Gen IB Sudjana, who is said to have a background in army logistics and no experience of the oil and gas industry. He was appointed minister of mining and energy in the March cabinet reshuffle. 'It came as a surprise to a lot of people, probably including the minister himself,' said a leading Jakarta businessman. One energy source he can look to with confidence, both for domestic use and for exports, is coal. Production is rising fast following the welcome given to foreign investors in the 1980s. Indonesia has 32bn tonnes of coal and lignite reserves. Exports doubled last year to 15m tonnes. By 1995, Indonesia should be producing 35m tonnes, of which about 21m will be exported. This year, Indonesia is expected to overtake Colombia as the world's fourth largest coal exporter, behind Australia, South Africa and the US.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NON-OIL/GAS EXPORTS (DOLLARS BN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DESTINATION       1988     1989      1990     1991     1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US                1.98      2.06     2.33     2.70     3.61 EC                2.08      2.40     3.20     3.82     4.59 Japan             2.69      3.64     3.27     3.68     3.

Chouinard Equipment Ltd. posted $6 million in sales last year. But it was the  industry leader, buoyed by the reputation of its high-performance gear and its  high-profile founder, who has spent months at a time climbing treacherous ice  in Antarctica or scaling Himalayan peaks without taking oxygen.    So, industry observers were surprised last month when the firm announced that  it was filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The Los Angeles Sierra Club chapter has dismantled part of its popular  mountaineering training course and dropped 300 mountaineering trips from its  extensive program of outings.    Some outdoor equipment business people fear that manufacturers and consumers  stand to lose if the suits against Chouinard succeed.    ""It would have a chilling effect on the climbing industry,"" said Michael  Kennedy, editor of Climbing, a magazine based in Carbondale, Colo.

Chouinard is one of only a few firms to file for Chapter 11 in the wake of  pending lawsuits. Johns Manville, which manufactured asbestos, and A.H.

0,FT934-2582 ,"FT934-2582 _AN-DLMDEAEFFT 931213   FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (3): The pressure rises - Natural Gas      By ROBERT CORZINE   Natural gas is undergoing a metamorphosis. Within just a few years it has shed its status as a nuisance by-product of oil and has donned the mantle of being the 'noble' fuel. Shares in oil companies rich in gas reserves have enjoyed stock market premiums in the past year. Gas distributors in industrialised countries are increasingly moving into international markets. Deregulation of the industry in the US has boosted prices and set off a mini-exploration boom in the Gulf of Mexico. Growing markets in the UK have resulted in mature North Sea oil fields, such as Brent, being re-engineered as gas producers. Further afield there has been a proliferation of proposals to build new pipelines to link remote reserves found in Russia, other former Soviet states and the Middle East with markets in Europe and Asia. The rising interest in gas across the world begs the question, however, of whether companies can actually develop a global strategy for gas along the lines of the international oil business. For unlike oil, the gas business varies widely by region. In addition it is not an internationally tradeable commodity in the sense of oil, which can be easily transported to a variety of markets in relatively small amounts. The high costs of gas require a direct physical and contractual link between the production site and consuming area. But there is no shortage of companies, mainly from the US and Europe, chasing the growing list of opportunities. They form three main groups: The development of specific gas fields for use in power generation schemes. The number of such projects has grown steadily, with many companies focusing on Asia, where gas consumption has risen by 126 per cent in the past 10 years and where electricity shortages have emerged because of rapid economic growth. The linking of large remote reserves to the main industrialised consuming countries, especially in Europe and Asia through long, high-capacity pipelines or by deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The high cost of such projects usually results in the formation of a consortium to spread the risks. A good-sized LNG scheme can cost Dollars 5bn to develop. Pipeline projects can cost even more - the Troll project linking North Sea gas fields off Norway with six European consuming countries will cost Dollars 11bn. The refurbishment of ageing domestic gas supply systems, a number of which are being privatised. British Gas, the biggest Western integrated gas company, has decided that its best growth prospects lie in applying its experience in both upstream and downstream areas to less regulated international markets. The company recently sold its Consumers Gas subsidiary in Toronto, the largest single element of its international holdings grouped under Global Gas, the international transportation and distribution division. The sale did not reflect a scaling back of British Gas' international ambitions, according to Mr Russell Herbert, head of Global Gas. It merely reflected a change in strategy to concentrate on less mature markets. A model for future projects, says Mr Herbert, is British Gas's current refurbishment of the privatised Buenos Aires and Berlin gas supply systems. Asia looms large in British Gas's expansion plans, with a variety of exploration and production projects and power generation schemes in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Pakistan. Its largest single project is the Karachaganak field in Kazahkstan, which could cost British Gas and Agip, the Italian oil company, as much as Dollars 6bn to develop. A number of other companies known mainly for oil production are significant forces in global gas markets. Shell, for example, has large gas businesses in the US, Europe and Asia. Its concentration has been on exploration and production rather than distribution, a trend which is likely to continue. Natural gas forms 68 per cent of the proven reserves of Total, the French company, which is particularly strong in Asia and Europe. US companies such as Mobil, Exxon and Amoco are also keen to build on their strong gas reserves. A number of national gas supply companies, such as Gaz de France, are seeking to profit internationally from their domestic expertise. The perceived need to be able to compete internationally was one one of the main factors behind the deal earlier this year in which Gas Natural, Spain's national domestic gas distributor 45 per cent owned by Repsol, the state controlled energy group, bought Enegas, the monopoly industrial gas supplier, which is fully owned by the state.

0,FT942-11716 ,"FT942-11716 _AN-EEDEHAFRFT 940504   FT  04 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Foreign miners not ready to invest in China - Progress has been made on liberalisation, but more is needed      By TONY WALKER   When representatives of some of the world's leading mining companies gathered in Beijing earlier this year for a minerals forum there was more than usual interest in China's proposals for a new regulatory regime governing foreign investment. China's mining sector has lagged well behind others, including notably oil and gas, in efforts to attract foreign involvement. Foreign investment and with it new technology is now critical to China if it is to make up for lost time in exploiting its mineral deposits to support a rapidly developing economy. Senior executives of companies like Teck Exploration of Canada, and CRA and BHP of Australia came away encouraged by what they had heard from Chinese officials. But to the question of whether they would commit large resources to exploration in China their response was: 'Not yet'. Mr Ian Gould, responsible for CRA's exploration worldwide, provided a typical industry view of China prospects at this stage. 'China is very much one of the countries we are monitoring carefully,' he said. 'But it is not quite at the point where CRA might be prepared to come in.' However, mining executives and academic experts involved in the minerals forum organised by the Pacific Economic Co-operation Council, which is sponsored by Pacific Rim countries, said China was making definite, albeit relatively slow, progress in clearing away barriers to foreign involvement. For the first time, according to Mr Gould, Chinese officials had begun speaking publicly about a specific 'contract of work' for mining ventures that would help facilitate negotiations that might otherwise become bogged down under cumbersome state mining legislation. Among regional countries, Indonesia has used the 'contract of work' approach to good effect in attracting foreign investment. Foreign miners believe the Chinese should follow the Indonesian model. Mr Fu Mingke, deputy director of the Ministry of Geology's development bureau admitted in an address to the forum that a 1986 mining law was now 'incompatible' with China's own market-oriented economy. It was also 'incomparable' with mining laws internationally. He acknowledged that the framing of a mining law would be complex and time-consuming, and therefore in the meantime China would 'develop a standard investment agreement (or contract). . . as a document supplemental to the mining regulations'. Mr Allen Clark, assistant director of Resources Programmes at the East-West centre in Hawaii, said there had been a 'very substantial change' in China's basic approach to opening the country to foreign miners. The country still had some way to go, however, before it could be regarded as an appealing location. Indications that the government was planning a 'resources tax' of up to 30 per cent suggested that the Chinese were not yet ready to fall into line internationally on standard royalties of between 1 and 5 per cent. Mining companies entering China now might be liable to an effective tax rate of 45 to 55 per cent, including taxes on profits and other levies, compared with an international average of 30 to 40 per cent. China, according to Mr Clark, was also mistaken in its apparent strategy of offering marginal projects to foreign miners rather than 'green field' sites. Chinese officials, fearful of criticism that they might be selling out the country's birthright, are excessively concerned about a foreign miner happening upon a high-grade and very profitable deposit. But in the end, foreign mining experts believe, enormous pressures on the mining sector from the China's leadership to provide more of the country's base metal and other mineral requirements will inevitably force speedier liberalisation. Mr James Dorian, co-ordinator of the China Energy Project at Hawaii's East-West Centre, pointed out at the forum that while China's mining industry ranked fourth in the world in output value, it was operating well below its potential. China, in fact, had a 'very low' per capita production of metals and minerals. Billions of dollars were required, Mr Dorian said, to modernise the industry, which was suffering from 'numerous problems', including low efficiencies in recovery, production and utilisation, outdated mining equipment and technology and severe transport bottlenecks. He added, however, that companies interested in business opportunities in China would need to 'remain flexible and patient' in seeking to understand not only the industry, but the 'often confusing' bureaucratic systems. 'The planned expansion and modernisation of China's mining industry will require tremendous influx of foreign technology and financing,' he said. 'Firms that are able to establish a successful track record today in China may be able to reap more substantial rewards in the long term.'   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.

Mr Phil Richards of the British Geological Survey, which carried out a seismic survey around the islands this year, said yesterday: 'The potential is good all around the islands. But we will not know exactly how much oil is there until someone starts digging.' The zone around the islands with the type of geological formation most likely to contain oil was 50 per cent larger than the British section of the North Sea, the survey said. But the Foreign Office said any new information could only be preliminary, since full seismic data would only become available next year. It further emphasised that seismic studies in themselves could not ensure the presence of oil. A round of exploratory drilling and more seismic tests were planned. Only after drilling could the presence of oil be guaranteed. Even then, it would be uncertain whether oil was available in commercial quantities, particularly given the difficult conditions in the waters around the islands, whose sovereignty is disputed between Britain and Argentina. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said this year that co-operation on oil exploration with Argentina remained a possibility. Oil company executives have said large-scale investment of oil development in the region would require a more explicit agreement on sovereignty than exists at present.

""    Company officials said that four lawsuits blame Chouinard for injuries  allegedly caused by inadequate instructions and warnings on climbing harnesses  and other equipment.    Chouinard denies the allegations. Officials of Lost Arrow, the umbrella firm  that runs Patagonia, Chouinard Equipment and several other companies, declined  to identify the plaintiffs, or to say where or when the suits had been filed.    ""No equipment failed and no equipment broke, but when people get hurt . . .  they sue,"" said Kevin Sweeney, a Lost Arrow spokesman.    Chouinard said that none of the lawsuits were filed by experienced climbers.  They were filed by beginners in climbing school, a window washer and an actor  who used the equipment on stage, he said.    Lost Arrow officials, who donate 10% of pretax profits to climbing and  environmental causes, said they aren't trying to evade their responsibilities  or liabilities. They said they are trying to ensure the company's survival.    They want to sever ties with Chouinard Equipment because they fear that Lost  Arrow's $70 million in assets could be attached if a lawsuit against the  mountaineering subsidiary succeeds.    As a result, Lost Arrow is trying to sell Chouinard Equipment. Lost Arrow  officials hope Chouinard's 70 employees will be able to raise the money to buy  the company themselves.    ""It definitely sets a precedent in the industry,"" said George Bracksieck,  editor of Rock and Ice, a climbing magazine based in Boulder, Colo. ""People  have sued over equipment failure before, but this is the first time one of the  major manufacturers of equipment has taken Chapter 11 because of suits.""      300 Trips Dropped    The increasing number of lawsuits and rising liability insurance costs already  have put mountaineers between a rock and a hard place. Last October, liability  concerns prompted the Sierra Club to drop all club-sponsored climbing trips  requiring ropes or ice axes.    The Los Angeles Sierra Club chapter has dismantled part of its popular  mountaineering training course and dropped 300 mountaineering trips from its  extensive program of outings.    Some outdoor equipment business people fear that manufacturers and consumers  stand to lose if the suits against Chouinard succeed.    ""It would have a chilling effect on the climbing industry,"" said Michael  Kennedy, editor of Climbing, a magazine based in Carbondale, Colo. ""The  equipment won't be as good, and people won't have the money to do testing and  development. You'll end up with a lot of smaller, fly-by-night companies.""    Throughout the industry, climbing aficionados and business people say that  while more people are climbing today than ever before, mountaineering remains a  high-risk sport with inherent dangers.      Other Firms    ""You can have the best equipment, but if you're high off the ground and make an  error, you can get killed pretty easily, and I think that needs to be  emphasized,"" Kennedy said.    Chouinard is one of only a few firms to file for Chapter 11 in the wake of  pending lawsuits. Johns Manville, which manufactured asbestos, and A. H.  Robins, which made the Dalkon shield, an intrauterine device that caused severe  medical problems for some women, filed for reorganization in two  well-publicized cases.    Legal experts said Chouinard might be making a smart move.    ""Filing Chapter 11 is not something that is socially reprehensible,"" said  Kenneth N. Klee, a UCLA law school professor who helped draft the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code. ""They could be doing two socially progressive things: Keeping  the business intact while they find out if they are liable and keeping their  employees in jobs while they litigate this issue.""    'Genuine Problem'    ""They're being pretty straightforward,"" agreed Chris Hughes, editor of  Specialty News, a Bend, Ore., trade newsletter for the outdoor industry. ""It's  a genuine problem for the whole outdoor industry.""    Lost Arrow officials hope that the sale of Chouinard to its employees or  another owner might help to discourage further lawsuits and reduce liability  insurance costs.    They added that Lost Arrow would retain responsibility for lawsuits filed  against products sold before the ownership transfer.    In any case, many who are familiar with Chouinard said the filing signifies the  end of an era.    Said Sweeney: ""The company's roots were in hardware gear and to sever those  roots does cause sadness around here.""    "

Arco estimated that the find in Alaska's Point McIntyre field had recoverable  reserves of about 300 million barrels of oil -- enough to add five months of  production from Alaska at current rates of about 2 million barrels per day,  analysts said.    The find is especially important to California, which relies on Alaskan oil for  about 40% of its supply.    ""This confirms that there are still a few major fields to be found in the  frontier areas of the United States,"" said Harry Quarls, an analyst with Booz,  Allen & Hamilton Inc. in Dallas.    Other analysts said the field was an important find but would not significantly  diminish the country's increasing reliance on foreign oil. ""It's nice, but it  doesn't fundamentally change your energy balance,"" said James Sweeney, a  professor at Stanford University specializing in energy economics and policy.      Impetus for Exploration    The Arco find adds impetus to increase exploration for oil in Alaska to replace  rapidly dwindling reserves, analysts said.    Industry officials believe much more oil remains to be placed into production  in Alaska and have been pushing to open drilling in the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge, under which government officials estimate there may be as much  as 9.6 billion barrels of recoverable oil.    But it also raised the concerns of environmentalists.    ""It is unwise at this point to start producing from new fields in Alaska until  we have at a minimum absorbed the lessons of Exxon Valdez, which we have not  even begun to do in terms of tanker safety,"" said James Thornton, a lawyer with  the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco.    ""Three hundred million barrels of oil is a reasonable amount of oil, but it's  trivial compared to the amount that could be saved through energy conservation,  particularly through energy efficient automobiles,"" Thornton said.      Comparable Fields    The Arco field compares with the last major find in Alaska, the Endicott Field  in 1978, which had about 350 million barrels of recoverable reserves, said  Susan Andrews, an Arco spokeswoman in Alaska. The last major discovery in the  Lower 48 states was the Point Pedernales Field off the shores of Lompoc,  Calif., in 1982, which had reserves of about 343 million barrels.    The new oil field was confirmed by a test well that resulted in a rate of flow  as high as 5,400 barrels a day, Arco said.    The well was the third drilled into the field and was about 2 1/2 miles east of  the first well, which was drilled in 1988 and yielded a flow rate of 2,500  barrels per day.    A second well showed rates as high as 5,350 barrels per day.    ""With testing completed on these two delineation wells, we have confirmed the  presence of a high quality reservoir with good porosity and permeability,"" said  Jerry Dees, vice president of exploration for Arco Alaska Inc.      Slower Production Rate    Many single wells in Alaska produce about 2,500 barrels a day, but the average  well in the United States currently yields about 13.5 barrels a day because  many of the fields in Texas and other states are mature.    The field is two miles from Prudhoe Bay. Arco shares as much as a 40% interest  in it with Exxon Corp. and BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., a unit of British  Petroleum.    Arco will drill more test wells to further define the field. Production would  not begin at the field until at least the mid-1990s, said Arco spokesman Al  Greenstein in Los Angeles.    Estimates on the amount of recoverable reserves from current Alaska fields  vary. But officials estimate that the remaining recoverable reserves from the  current Prudhoe Bay field at about 5 billion barrels and from the nearby  Kuparuk field about 1.6 billion to 2 billion barrels, down from about 10  billion to 12 billion at the beginning of production.    Andrews estimated that there was at least 20 years of production remaining from  Prudhoe Bay. ""While it has reached its peak, there are still many years of  production left.""    Another 15 billion to 20 billion barrels may lie in the so-called West Sak  field, but the amount of recoverable oil may be far less because of the  difficulty of extracting it.

Earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.25 from 97 cents. Stripping out special items, Mobil said fourth-quarter earnings rose 50 per cent to Dollars 583m. Revenues in the last three months stood at Dollars 17.24bn compared with Dollars 17.17bn in the same period of 1991. For all 1992, net earnings fell 55 per cent to Dollars 863m or Dollars 2.01, from 1991's Dollars 1.92bn, or Dollars 4.65. Revenues rose to Dollars 63.82bn from Dollars 63.22bn. Mobil took a non-cash charge in 1992 for the adoption of new accounting standards. Excluding special items, Mobil said its earnings fell 21 per cent to Dollars 1.49bn in the year. Pressures of weak economies and soft industry demand hurt operating earnings from downstream and chemical operations in 1992. Underlying marketing and refining earnings fell to Dollars 354m for the year from Dollars 1.02bn. Those of the chemical business fell to Dollars 76m from Dollars 217m. Stripping out special items, earnings from exploration and producing rose 20 per cent to Dollars 1.48bn in the year.

Foreign Ministry sources said today that waters 4-5 km west  to the Thasos island are not among the disputed regions between  the two countries.    The Greek Government had announced that it might carry out  further drilling activities in the Aegean if the current  explorations yield a positive result.    Turkey is closely following these activities so that they  are  not expanded to the disputed areas determined in the Bern  Agreement of 1976 on the two countries' continental shelf.    Under the Bern Agreement both countries had ended their  explorations in disputed waters of the Aegean.    Athens had filed a complaint before the International Court  of Justice in the Hague and the U.N. Security Council against  Turkey which began exploring oil in the Aegean, after Greece.    As Greece sought the approval of these bodies to declare the  Aegean as a Greek sea, the International Court of Justice had,  in 1976, called on for a Turkish-Greek dialogue to resolve the  matter.    Turkish and Greek officials which came together in November  1976 had taken conciliating steps in resolving the continental  shelf matter.    The continental shelf issue was aggravated by the new PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government of Greece in 1981  and Premier Andreas Papandreou has ended the talks.     "

A British Gas executive yesterday confirmed that 'we have been discussing with YPF a number of possible joint ventures. There is an offering in the South Atlantic and we have discussed the possibility of joining up with YPF, but there is nothing formal yet.' The government plans to sell rights to six blocks in Argentine waters adjacent to Falkland waters. A tender was scheduled for last Wednesday, but YPF requested it be postponed for 90 days after British Gas had asked for more time to analyse technical data. A government official said no other companies were interested in the region because of the dispute with Britain over the Falkland islands. None the less, two companies are carrying out seismic exploration surveys off the Falklands under licences issued by the islands. Buenos Aires is anxious to increase British trade and investment, which it hopes would allay the Falklands' suspicion of Argentina and create commercial ties with Britain that would offset the vociferous pro-Falkland lobby in London. British Gas already produces oil in Argentina and last December bought a 29 per cent share in the privatised Buenos Aires gas distribution company. UK plans to invite Argentine ministers to Britain later this year have been welcomed in Buenos Aires.   Companies:-  British Gas.     Yacimientos Petroliferos Fascales.

Warning that the nation's appetite for energy is matched only by its apparent  hostility toward future oil exploration, Lujan will declare: ""The current  situation is a time bomb waiting to explode.""    The strongly worded remarks, prepared for a major address on oil policy that  Lujan plans to give in Long Beach, Calif., represent the Bush Administration's  first concerted effort to staunch the wave of anti-drilling sentiment produced  by the recent rash of oil spills. A copy of the speech was made available to  The Times.    With the Senate apparently prepared to follow the House in putting much of the  nation's coastline off limits to drilling for at least a year, the speech marks  an aggressive attempt by the Administration to restore support for an energy  policy that views offshore oil as a vital resource.    ""Our answer to this current energy crisis lies just several miles off our  shores and in Alaska,"" Lujan will declare.    While the address reiterates President Bush's commitment not to pursue oil  development at the expense of the environment, its tone is reminiscent of the  strong advocacy of offshore drilling of Interior secretaries in the Ronald  Reagan Administration.    As such, it provides the clearest indication to date that the Bush  Administration -- despite the appointment of a task force to review  controversial drilling proposals -- has no intention of supporting sweeping  changes in the nation's drilling plans.    Bowing to environmental concerns, Lujan plans to acknowledge publicly today  that he is considering barring oil tankers from most of the nation's ports,  requiring them instead to unload their cargoes at offshore ""super ports"" from  which oil would be pumped inland by undersea pipeline.    The plan, first disclosed by The Times, reflects the disproportionate tanker  role in oil spills.    One such deep-water port is already in place off the Louisiana coast, and Lujan  plans to suggest today that similar structures could ""greatly reduce"" the risks  of collision and oil spills in Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia and Valdez,  Alaska.    At the same time, Lujan's speech scorns the ""clamor"" of opposition to offshore  drilling and challenges as ""unfounded"" the view that drilling programs present  unacceptable environmental risks.    ""By imposing these moratoria,"" Lujan will declare, ""the Congress is saying that  we should blindly reject even the possibilities before us, burying our heads in  the sands of our ignorance.""      White House Approval    A senior aide to Lujan said that department officials expect the address, which  has been approved by the White House, to draw a strong negative reaction from  the environmental community. But with control of the debate over oil  exploration slipping beyond the Administration's grasp, he said, ""Lujan had to  make a sound loud enough to shake things up.""    The near-collapse of pro-drilling forces in the House last week forced the  Administration to abandon a planned attempt to block the drilling moratorium  proposal on the House floor.    Among the salvos in his counteroffensive today, Lujan plans to include a  conciliatory gesture, saying that he appreciates ""the sincerity and the  well-meaning intentions of all those who are concerned with the environmental  impact of drilling . . . .""    Lujan will argue that the nation's growing appetite for imported oil makes it  necessary for the United States to develop new offshore oil resources if it is  to avoid becoming even more dependent on foreign oil.

""Our national security and our economic future are dependent upon the decisions  we make about our nation's energy policy. . . .

In the speech, Lujan also plans to redouble his advocacy of Administration  plans to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where scheduled  oil exploration has come under renewed controversy in the wake of the Exxon  Valdez oil spill in March.

0,FT933-3146 ,"FT933-3146 _AN-DIOCVAEIFT 930915   FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Goal net profits rise 18% to Pounds 2.8m      By ROBERT CORZINE   GOAL Petroleum, the UK independent exploration and production company, reported an 18 per cent jump in net profits to Pounds 2.8m for the first half of the year despite a 13 per cent fall in production. Earnings per share also rose 18 per cent to 2.07p. The decline in output was offset by favourable exchange rate movements which resulted in higher sterling prices for oil. Turnover to the end of June remained unchanged from the same period last year at Pounds 20.9m, according to Mr Roger Bexon, chairman. He said the company would use its financial strength - net borrowings fell Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 16.2m to give a gearing ratio of 18 per cent - to expand reserves, either through successful exploration, acquisition or by boosting output of existing reserves, such as the Wytch Farm and Magnus fields in the UK. Mr Bexon added that the changes made earlier this year to the UK's petroleum tax regime would 'substantially increase' Goal's discretionary income and enhance its flexibility in making any acquisitions. 'While the North Sea still offers many opportunities ..we continually review possible investments in other areas,' he said. The company's average production rate was 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day during the first half of the year (11,500). The fall was due to planned maintainence shutdowns at the Buchan and Wytch Farm fields. There is again no interim dividend.   Companies:-  Goal Petroleum.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Although oil companies publicly expressed disappointment at the President's  decision to make many offshore areas off-limits for most of the decade,  industry officials privately admitted that many oil companies had already  placed offshore plans on the back burner.    ""Chevron probably would not show up tomorrow if there was a lease sale,"" one  industry insider said.    The reason: Regulatory delays, falling crude prices and endless court  challenges have threatened to turn offshore production into an unprofitable  proposition. Many companies are exploring for oil abroad, where environmental  restrictions are less rigorous.    Bush said Tuesday that he will delay most future sales of leases in waters off  the Pacific Northwest, California and Florida until after the turn of the  century, to allow more environmental study. An exception is 87 tracts off  Southern California, which may go on sale after 1996.    In a federal lease sale, companies bid for the right to explore for oil on the  outer continental shelf, three miles beyond the shoreline.    The President's decision would apparently not affect oil exploration and  production projects on parcels already leased off the coast of California,  where platforms are producing about 80,000 barrels a day. The decision also  leaves open the question of offshore exploration in Alaska.    Industry officials still believe that untapped reservoirs off U.S. coasts hold  billions of gallons of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. Until  recently, most major companies were hoping to bid on leases off Northern and  Southern California to get at some of that oil.    The industry's main trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, argued that  Bush's decision will accelerate the drop in domestic oil production, lead to  greater reliance on imports and oil tanker shipments, and result in the flight  of U.S. capital and technology to foreign countries.    That notwithstanding, oil companies have already made plans that don't include  underwater projects. They are aware that public sentiment is against opening  more offshore areas in the wake of last year's oil spills -- most notably that  from the tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound.    The companies ""long ago put aside plans to put together bids,"" said Carl  Schmid, spokesman for the National Ocean Industries Assn., a trade group of  offshore operators.    Unocal Corp., which has sizable holdings off California's coast, has spent  virtually nothing the past couple of years to prepare for future sales of  offshore leases, spokesman Arthur H. Bentley said.    Another reason for the industry's reluctance to pursue offshore drilling: A  lease sale is only the first step in an arduous process that may or may not  result in oil production -- and profits.    Chevron Corp. has lead a consortium of 18 oil firms that have struggled  unsuccessfully for 10 years to launch production from the $2-billion Point  Arguello project. It has become a symbol of industry frustration over trying to  produce oil during environmentally sensitive times. Despite the time and money,  the project has yet to produce a drop of oil.    Last year, Chevron wrote off $445 million of its $800-million investment in the  massive project off the coast of Santa Barbara County -- an acknowledgement  that, even if the project goes forward, it is unlikely to repay its costs.    Elsewhere, the California Coastal Commission has objected on air-quality  grounds to federal government permits granted to Chevron and Conoco for the  drilling of exploratory wells on two leases off the coast of Ventura and Santa  Barbara counties. They are believed to be the most recent requests for  exploratory drilling off California's coast. The companies are appealing.    For some oil firms, the only real effect of Bush's decision will be the outcome  of projects involving leases off the coasts of New England and Florida that  have already been paid for.    The President ordered cancellation of existing leases in the Georges Bank area  off New England and directed Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. to begin  studying a possible buyback and cancellation of existing leases off Florida.  The government has already sold 73 leases off Florida.    Bentley said Unocal was still not sure how Bush's announcement will affect it.  It has invested more than $20 million in leases off the Florida coast.    Mobil Corp. estimated that it has spent $33.2 million on leases in the same  area.

0,FT942-12805 ,"FT942-12805 _AN-ED1EOAA5FT 940428   FT  28 APR 94 / Argentina and UK to hold oil talks      By JOHN BARHAM      BUENOS AIRES   Britain and Argentina are to hold talks in July on joint oil exploration in waters surrounding the Falkland Islands, two years after a previous round of oil talks collapsed. A British official said negotiators would focus on the next phase of exploration. The Falklands' government plans a second licensing round for seismic explorations beginning in July and running until March 1995. The Falklands selected two companies to carry out initial seismic surveys shortly after the 1992 negotiations failed. Argentina broke off talks after failing to agree on demarcation of Falkland waters bordering its territorial waters. International oil companies say co-operation with Argentina is important, given the need for heavy investments in a disputed zone. A UK official said successful joint management of fish stocks showed the sovereignty dispute could be put aside while both sides pursued practical interests, but Argentina's foreign ministry argues oil is different because it is a non-renewable resource, with important legal and tax ramifications. Both sides fear concessions over oil would imply recognition of the other's sovereignty claim. The Falklands remain a fixation in Argentina, which still claims the islands, despite defeat in the 1982 conflict with Britain. President Carlos Menem says Argentina will 'recover' the islands by the year 2000. Argentine security forces have raided a secret training camp in thick forest close to Buenos Aires used by paramilitaries linked to right-wing army rebels who have led four mutinies since 1987.

HARR JR., Karl G. Harr Jr., former national security coordinator for  President Dwight D. Eisenhower and for many years president of the Aerospace  Industries Assn., is now a senior fellow at the Eisenhower World Affairs  Institute.      In time, and with considerable expense, we can land men and women on Mars. We  can also establish a permanent manned base on the moon. We are building a  manned space station. And there are numerous fascinating unmanned missions we  can undertake.    Because of the cost and time commitments involved in pursuing any of these  options, we have important decisions to make about our nation's future in  space.    For those of us who played a role in formulating original U.S. space policy 32  years ago, considerations today about the future of space evoke strong feelings  of deja vu. The situation now is vastly different from that of 1957 when  Sputnik was launched, but the questions and the need to resolve them quickly  are fundamentally the same. How big should our effort be? How should our  programs be divided between military and civil? Manned and unmanned? National  and international? And space exploration's huge cost remains unchanged, causing  tough choices for any nation contemplating significant space ventures.    Today, however, the one great difference lies in changed U.S.-Soviet relations.  In 1958 and 1959, when the National Security Council Planning Board developed  from scratch the first national policy on space, we were at the peak of the  Cold War. The atmosphere between the two nations was hostile, distrustful and  fearful. We welcomed each other's failures and took great pleasure in ""beating""  the other in one space achievement or another.    Only on the most cosmetic level was there talk of cooperation. Barely beneath  the surface was a shared fear that the other's space capabilities portended  important, perhaps, decisive, military capabilities. And in the struggle for  world leadership, space achievements counted heavily as symbols of national  advance or decline.    Today, such national security and world leadership concerns remain important to  both nations, but count for much less. As our sophistication is increasing, our  mutual paranoia is subsiding considerably. And the rest of the world is no  longer so closely interested in ""who's ahead?""    Dr. Roald Sagdeyev, former director of the Soviet Space Research Institute and  newly elected People's Deputy, has made it clear that the United States is not  alone in facing tough decisions about its future in space; such decisions also  confront the Soviet Union.    So why not cooperate, where we can, under whatever ground rules we are  comfortable with?    Cooperation can help alleviate the heavy financial pressure on both of our  space programs. The United States, with its annual appropriations cycle and  two-year congressional terms, has always felt downward pressure (sure to stay  strong as long as the high deficit remains). The Soviet Union, more tightly  controlled, has seemed better able to sustain long-term, high-cost programs.  But now, with perestroika lagging, it, too, is feeling the pressure of public  opinion on space expenditures. The Soviets are cutting back on existing  programs, such as the Mir space station, and re-evaluating others, such as Mars  exploration. They are also sensitive, Sagdeyev says, to the unnecessary costs  incurred as a result of our respective programs duplicating one another.    So we both face the choice between cooperating or turning our backs on the  major challenges in front of us.    In terms of current domestic attitudes toward cooperation on civil space  exploration, both countries have much to draw on that we never had before.  Whether or not we can overcome the obstacles to such cooperation is the  question.    There is, for example, the widely held American view that cooperating with the  Soviets on non-military space projects will afford them disproportionate gains  from ""technology transfer."" While this concern is valid, it is manageable  because so many measures have been developed to protect against undesirable  disclosures.    If we can overcome this and other roadblocks, we will have an enormous  potential joint capability -- scientifically, technologically and economically.  If we cannot, or choose not to do so, we might as well forget about major  advancement in space for a long time to come.    Yes, we will have a worthwhile menu of unmanned space missions such as the  recently launched Magellan probe to Venus, the on-going Project Earth missions  and the forthcoming Hubble telescope mission. But we will have forgone any  meaningful manned exploration of the universe, and perhaps even have seriously  limited our opportunities for unmanned missions. That would be sad given the  measure of our joint capabilities. And it would be difficult, if not  impossible, to resuscitate such capabilities once abandoned.    It is time we take a new giant leap in space and, with prudence at every step,  go with it on an international basis. The exploration of space, to realize its  full potential, must become an arena of international cooperation.

So we both face the choice between cooperating or turning our backs on the  major challenges in front of us.    In terms of current domestic attitudes toward cooperation on civil space  exploration, both countries have much to draw on that we never had before.  Whether or not we can overcome the obstacles to such cooperation is the  question.    There is, for example, the widely held American view that cooperating with the  Soviets on non-military space projects will afford them disproportionate gains  from ""technology transfer."" While this concern is valid, it is manageable  because so many measures have been developed to protect against undesirable  disclosures.    If we can overcome this and other roadblocks, we will have an enormous  potential joint capability -- scientifically, technologically and economically.  If we cannot, or choose not to do so, we might as well forget about major  advancement in space for a long time to come.    Yes, we will have a worthwhile menu of unmanned space missions such as the  recently launched Magellan probe to Venus, the on-going Project Earth missions  and the forthcoming Hubble telescope mission. But we will have forgone any  meaningful manned exploration of the universe, and perhaps even have seriously  limited our opportunities for unmanned missions. That would be sad given the  measure of our joint capabilities. And it would be difficult, if not  impossible, to resuscitate such capabilities once abandoned.    It is time we take a new giant leap in space and, with prudence at every step,  go with it on an international basis. The exploration of space, to realize its  full potential, must become an arena of international cooperation.      Opinion    "

Speaking on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing, Bush said the  Apollo astronauts ""left more than flags and footprints on the moon. They also  left some unfinished business.""    Bush said the United States must begin a journey ""back to the moon, back to the  future, and this time, back to stay.""    But, although Bush threw his support solidly behind a pending $30-billion  program to launch a manned space station called Freedom, the President stopped  short of advocating specific timetables or budgets for more distant space  exploration targets.      Quayle to Work Out Details    Instead, Bush directed Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National  Space Council, to work out the details.    Bush's address, delivered on the steps of the Smithsonian Institution's Air and  Space Museum, apparently helped head off a serious political defeat for the  space program in Congress. Acting just hours later, the House rejected an  attempt to strike $714 million from the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration's budget for the space station program.    The scuttled amendment, proposed during House debate on a 1990 appropriation  bill, would have shifted the money to medical programs for veterans, pollution  control efforts and housing assistance. The House Appropriations Committee  already had cut $400 million from the $2 billion sought by the Bush  Administration.      Complaints About Expense    But Bush's speech drew a cautious response from lawmakers, who complained that  the space station alone has proven too expensive for a Congress already under  intense fiscal pressure.    ""Given the federal budget deficit and earthly demands, I don't see how we can  afford expensive manned programs in space in the near future,"" said Rep. Bill  Green (R-N.Y.), ranking Republican on the House subcommittee that funds NASA.    ""People also dream of a home in the country or a trip around the world,"" Green  said, ""but like couples with big mortgages and kids in college, this country  has bills to pay before taking costly adventures.""    Speaking before the President, Michael Collins, the astronaut who commanded the  Apollo spaceship 20 years ago while his fellow astronauts walked on the moon,  defended the space program in the face of competing national priorities.    ""We cannot launch our planetary probes from a springboard of poverty,  discrimination or unrest,"" Collins said. ""But neither can we wait until each  and every terrestrial problem has been solved. Such logic 200 years ago would  have prevented expansion westward of the Appalachian Mountains, for assuredly  the Eastern Seaboard was beset by problems of great urgency then, as it is  today.""    NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly said his agency has devised no firm cost  estimates for the more ambitious goals advocated by the President. But  independent experts have said that an aggressive program designed to establish  a permanent moon presence and to launch a manned Mars probe could cost $30  billion to $35 billion annually, almost doubling current expenditures.    ""I don't know what the budgets will turn out to be, but I can assure you that  they are very affordable, I believe, in the total context and over a long  period of time,"" Truly said.    Truly said that earlier independent space commissions have called for such  undertakings as the manned exploration of Mars and the establishment of a  permanent research station on the moon.    ""Until this morning, we really have not had a President who laid out in broad  terms his view and his series of goals so that the Space Council and NASA can  flesh them out,"" Truly said.    In advocating a return to the moon and an eventual mission to Mars, Bush  appears to have seized the initiative from the Soviet Union. For years, those  programs have been long-term goals of Soviet scientists and space officials,  said Nicholas L. Johnson, an advisory scientist with Teledyne-Brown Engineering  and an expert on the Soviet space program.    Bush said the nation's first space priority is the space station, which would  be lofted into orbit in phases, beginning in 1995. He called the future  spacecraft ""a new bridge between the worlds and an investment in the growth,  prosperity and technical superiority of our nation.""    The President and NASA officials also emphasized the space station's role in  researching earthly problems, such as global warming, also known as the  greenhouse effect.

With today's launch of a Santiago office by Yorkton Securities - the first Canadian brokerage house to set up in Chile - she is to act as its investment adviser there. The well connected mining entrepreneur first broke into the industry by joining Anglo American's subsidiary in Chile on the administration side in the 1980s. She then branched off on her own and has been involved in numerous mining projects, including the San Cristobal gold mine, eventually sold to Battle Mountain Gold's subsidiary, Niugini Mining. While going on running her Windsor Resources exploration company, which is looking for more gold and copper projects, at Yorkton's office she will work with another woman with mining even deeper in her veins: operations manager Catherine McLeod. Daughter of Canadian mines man Don McLeod, she has worked mainly as a banker and broker to the mining community. She says that, by having people on the spot, Yorkton should be well set to win business from the expected second wave of mines investment in Chile - now the mining houses' favourite stamping ground.

The 120 activists on board were protesting against Indonesia's treatment of East Timor. They claimed success for their voyage which had focused the eyes of the world on the former Portuguese colony. Australia had feared the ship would provoke a confrontation with Indonesia. Portugal said the naval interception was illegal, and urged international condemnation of Indonesia. Passengers said the ship, the Lusitania Expresso, came within two miles of Indo-nesian territorial waters before being ordered to turn back by the commander of a task force of three warships. It left Darwin on Monday for Dili, capital of East Timor. Indonesian troops killed at least 50 pro-independence demonstrators in Dili late last year. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after the departure of Portuguese colonial officials and troops. The region was annexed by Indonesia the following year. This has never been recognised by the United Nations, but has been accepted by Australia, which last year signed a treaty with Indonesia dividing oil exploration rights in the Timor Sea. Mr John Kerin, Australia's acting foreign minister, said Indonesia had acted 'sensibly and responsibly,' and denied that the ship's voyage had embarrassed Canberra. Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, said he would visit Indonesia later this year on his first overseas trip since his appointment in December.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

(e)     Allocation of Funds to Local Partnerships.     When the notice of proposed priority was published, the Departments did not have the authority to require States to award subgrants to local partnerships with funds awarded under this competition. The 1994 Department of Education Appropriation Act (Pub. L. 103112), included a provision authorizing grantees of funds under this competition to make subgrants to localities for carrying out School-to-Work Opportunities projects. In light of this new authority, the notice has been modified so that it now requires States receiving School-to-Work Opportunities Implementation grants under this competition to distribute to local partnerships 65 percent of the amounts they receive, as subgrants to localities.

This criterion is intended to ensure that State skill standards and methods of skill assessment are benchmarked to high quality standards and that students receiving skill certificates under the School-to-Work Opportunities program will have the opportunity to enter high-skill, high-wage, employment. Accordingly, the question ``Does the State's process for assessing skills reflect the needs of high performance workplaces as well as meet the requirements of broad clusters of related occupations and industries, rather than those of individual jobs or occupations?'' has been added to this criterion.

That is where the oil industry wants to extend its search for oil -- and where  environmentalists have planted a stake in the ground. Both sides say that the  issue has been catapulted to the top of the environmental agenda in Congress by  the recent oil disaster.    A classic policy battle even before the accident off the port of Valdez, the  argument is portrayed by the two sides in almost cosmic terms: the survival of  North America's last complete ecosystem versus the nation's last best hope for  another world-class oil field to protect the national security.    At issue is the coastal plain of Alaska National Wildlife Refuge in northeast  Alaska, a strip of land 100 miles wide by 18 to 40 miles deep that lies between  the Beaufort Sea and the northernmost foothills of Alaska's Brooks Range. The  coastal plain takes up 1.5 million acres of the 19-million-acre refuge.    Congress must approve any commercial activity in the refuge and one of three  bills on the issue -- opening the plain up for development -- was approved 12  to 7 last month by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It is  sponsored by Sens. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), chairman of the committee, and  the ranking minority member of the panel, Sen. James A. McClure (R-Ida.).    The oil industry's supporters, including President Bush, insisted last week  that it is illogical to link the tanker spill with the safety of oil drilling.  Most of the nation's crude oil arrives by tanker and that will not change  regardless of what development takes place in Alaska.    If oil were found on the coastal plain, it probably would enter production in  10 years. With Prudhoe Bay production already entering its natural decline, the  new oil would supplant it, prolonging rather than increasing the tanker traffic  from Valdez.    ""They're not related,"" declared Walter J. Hickel, the former Interior secretary  and ex-governor of Alaska who has long advocated the development of the state's  rich resources. ""The wildlife refuge is a drilling problem and Valdez is a  tanker problem. But from a perception standpoint, I can well understand that  it's going to be a problem.""      Highlights Risks    Opponents see the oil spill as a powerful argument to sway undecided lawmakers  because it highlights the risks of the oil system versus the advantages of  energy conservation or the development of cleaner forms of energy.    Critics also said that the apparent snafus that both caused and followed the  spill have seriously weakened the credibility of the oil industry, which has  boasted until now of having operated in the Arctic for 20 years and produced 6  billion barrels of crude oil without environmental disaster.    ""For days, everybody in the nation has been bombarded with these images from  Valdez,"" said John Katz, the head of the state of Alaska's Washington office.  ""The oil spill is going to have a profound influence on decision-making in  Washington.""    At a minimum, the spill could generate support for additional delays or for  linkage of any congressional action opening up the refuge to such  conservationist goals as tougher fuel economy standards for cars.    ""This dramatic spill will finally get the attention of a lot of people who  haven't looked at it very hard until now,"" said former Sen. Gaylord Nelson  (D-Wis.), an adviser to the Wilderness Society in Washington.    ""We may very well have the votes, as a result of this, to at least refer it to  the National Academy of Science for study.""      Raises Questions    Said an aide to Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), whose Interior subcommittee  has jurisdiction over all three pending House bills on the refuge: ""Nobody's  going to say: 'I changed my mind because of the spill.' But this raises a lot  of questions about development. This is a major political event in addition to  an ecological event.""    The refuge, established by Congress in two steps in 1960 and 1980, adjoins  Canada's Yukon Territory and embraces several peaks in the Brooks Range, a  virtually sacred region to such conservationists as the late Supreme Court  Justice William O. Douglas.    Oilmen have restricted their exploration target to the coastal plain, a flat to  gently rolling, treeless piece of landscape -- ""a flat, crummy place,"" as an  Atlantic Richfield executive unwisely described it a few years ago -- said to  overlie 26 major geologic structures.    The legislation that completed creation of the wildlife refuge in 1980 also  ordered a separate study of the biology and the oil potential of the coastal  plain. A consortium of oil companies produced an optimistic report that led the  Ronald Reagan Administration to recommend in April, 1987, that the plain be  opened to oil exploration and development.    The pro-development report by then-Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel has  attracted almost as much debate as the coastal plain itself. Field biologists  at Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service complained that the report was  sanitized, understating the possibilities of environmental damage arising from  oil development.    The report conceded that the coastal plain has ""outstanding Arctic habitats  which support fish and wildlife species of national and international  significance."" But it concluded: ""The public interest demands that the area be  made available for oil and gas exploration and development. . . .""      200 Species Present    The plain has about 200 species of wildlife and fish, among them 500 musk oxen,  100 brown bears, a few dozen wolves, 325,000 geese and 300,000 other wildfowl.    But the chief concern is the Porcupine caribou herd, the continent's  sixth-largest migratory herd of caribou, officially estimated at 180,000  animals. They travel a route back and forth from a winter site in interior  Canada to the Wildlife Refuge for a 6- to 10-week period each summer.    Although another caribou herd appears to have prospered despite the huge oil  field developments at Prudhoe Bay about 100 miles to the west, the Porcupine  herd historically has used the coastal plain of the refuge as a calving ground.    Studies show that when the animals do not reach the plain to calve -- which  occurs if there is a late thaw, for instance -- there is a significantly higher  death rate among the offspring.    Protecting the normal calving ground has become a focus of the oil battle.  Another bill before Congress -- introduced by Rep. Walter B. Jones (D-N.C.),  chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee -- would open  most of the coastal plain but impose a 10-year moratorium on the calving ground  itself for further study.    In one example of the hazy scientific parameters of the debate, the very  existence of a particular calving ground within the refuge and its boundaries  is disputed. The whole concept was excised from the Interior Department report.  Most of the caribou have not even reached the plain to calve in the last two  years because of a late snow melt, biologists say.    But David Klein, a wildlife biologist at the University of Alaska who has  studied the Arctic for 30 years, says that the latest research on the Porcupine  herd bolsters the calving ground theory by showing that the forage there is  superior to that elsewhere. This helps explain the highly successful calving on  the plain, he said.    The geological facts are also unclear, and will be unless exploration is  permitted. Exploration itself    would not disrupt the plain much, says a new report by the Congressional Office  of Technology Assessment, but development would mean a ""major industrial  infrastructure"" comparable to that at Prudhoe Bay, but more modern.    If there is oil at all, the Interior Department report said, it is likely to  amount to about 3.2 billion barrels, which would make it the nation's  third-largest discovery after Prudhoe Bay and the East Texas field.    The report by the Office of Technology Assessment said that estimate is  probably too low, although the oil industry repeatedly has been disappointed in  the Arctic since the 1968 discovery of Prudhoe's 9 billion barrels.    One exploratory well has been drilled by Chevron on part of the plain  controlled by the native village of Kaktovik. Citing competitive reasons,  Chevron recently won a court battle to keep results of the test well a secret.      Oil Consumption Jumps    If the oil spill casts the debate in a new light, so has the sharp decline in  world oil prices of the last three years. It has helped cause a steep  international jump in consumption, and in the United States has depressed oil  production and driven the nation's dependence on foreign oil back up to 1970s,  pre-oil-shock levels.    The big oil companies have used this as ammunition in their campaign to win  access to the wildlife refuge, triggering anew the old debate about whether the  nation has an energy policy.    For instance, the Reagan Administration's relaxation of auto fuel economy  standards has already caused the nation to consume an extra 300 million barrels  or so. As vice president, George Bush headed a deregulation task force that  advocated doing away with fuel economy standards altogether.    If driving and car-purchasing habits went unchanged for as long as a new  3.2-billion-barrel oil field is likely to remain in production, the relaxation  in fuel economy standards would effectively swallow up all the new oil.    Similar criticisms are leveled at the recent increases in highway speed limits,  which have also boosted gasoline consumption. And the nation's low taxes on  gasoline -- paltry compared to those levied in Europe and Japan -- have helped  enlarge the country's appetite for oil.    ""The good thing that might come out of this spill is if it reminds people that  energy and the environment are related and if they start examining some of  these issues,"" said Jack Riggs, staff director of the House Energy and Commerce  subcommittee on energy and power.      Alaskans Reap Bonanza    The fate of the federally owned wildlife refuge is not up to Alaskans, who have  supported oil development and been rewarded with a financial bonanza over the  last decade.    Alaska's citizens, including its native groups, have seen billions of dollars  in oil revenues used to extend better schools, roads, health care,  communications and other hallmarks of modern life to the most remote sections  of the rugged state. Every Alaskan even gets an annual lump-sum payment of  several hundred dollars from the state's oil-fed financial reserves.    But if they had a vote on the refuge today, state officials say, it would be a  lot closer than it would have been before the spill.    ""There's really no relationship between the wildlife refuge and the question of  whether we can move oil safely,"" says Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), who  remains a staunch advocate of development. ""But Alaskans feel betrayed. The  state had signed off on the adequacy of the oil industry's ability to avoid  this kind of thing.""

That is where the oil industry wants to extend its search for oil -- and where  environmentalists have planted a stake in the ground. Both sides say that the  issue has been catapulted to the top of the environmental agenda in Congress by  the recent oil disaster.    A classic policy battle even before the accident off the port of Valdez, the  argument is portrayed by the two sides in almost cosmic terms: the survival of  North America's last complete ecosystem versus the nation's last best hope for  another world-class oil field to protect the national security.    At issue is the coastal plain of Alaska National Wildlife Refuge in northeast  Alaska, a strip of land 100 miles wide by 18 to 40 miles deep that lies between  the Beaufort Sea and the northernmost foothills of Alaska's Brooks Range. The  coastal plain takes up 1.5 million acres of the 19-million-acre refuge.    Congress must approve any commercial activity in the refuge and one of three  bills on the issue -- opening the plain up for development -- was approved 12  to 7 last month by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It is  sponsored by Sens. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), chairman of the committee, and  the ranking minority member of the panel, Sen. James A. McClure (R-Ida.).    The oil industry's supporters, including President Bush, insisted last week  that it is illogical to link the tanker spill with the safety of oil drilling.  Most of the nation's crude oil arrives by tanker and that will not change  regardless of what development takes place in Alaska.    If oil were found on the coastal plain, it probably would enter production in  10 years. With Prudhoe Bay production already entering its natural decline, the  new oil would supplant it, prolonging rather than increasing the tanker traffic  from Valdez.    ""They're not related,"" declared Walter J. Hickel, the former Interior secretary  and ex-governor of Alaska who has long advocated the development of the state's  rich resources. ""The wildlife refuge is a drilling problem and Valdez is a  tanker problem. But from a perception standpoint, I can well understand that  it's going to be a problem.""      Highlights Risks    Opponents see the oil spill as a powerful argument to sway undecided lawmakers  because it highlights the risks of the oil system versus the advantages of  energy conservation or the development of cleaner forms of energy.    Critics also said that the apparent snafus that both caused and followed the  spill have seriously weakened the credibility of the oil industry, which has  boasted until now of having operated in the Arctic for 20 years and produced 6  billion barrels of crude oil without environmental disaster.    ""For days, everybody in the nation has been bombarded with these images from  Valdez,"" said John Katz, the head of the state of Alaska's Washington office.  ""The oil spill is going to have a profound influence on decision-making in  Washington.""    At a minimum, the spill could generate support for additional delays or for  linkage of any congressional action opening up the refuge to such  conservationist goals as tougher fuel economy standards for cars.    ""This dramatic spill will finally get the attention of a lot of people who  haven't looked at it very hard until now,"" said former Sen. Gaylord Nelson  (D-Wis.), an adviser to the Wilderness Society in Washington.    ""We may very well have the votes, as a result of this, to at least refer it to  the National Academy of Science for study.""      Raises Questions    Said an aide to Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), whose Interior subcommittee  has jurisdiction over all three pending House bills on the refuge: ""Nobody's  going to say: 'I changed my mind because of the spill.' But this raises a lot  of questions about development. This is a major political event in addition to  an ecological event.""    The refuge, established by Congress in two steps in 1960 and 1980, adjoins  Canada's Yukon Territory and embraces several peaks in the Brooks Range, a  virtually sacred region to such conservationists as the late Supreme Court  Justice William O. Douglas.    Oilmen have restricted their exploration target to the coastal plain, a flat to  gently rolling, treeless piece of landscape -- ""a flat, crummy place,"" as an  Atlantic Richfield executive unwisely described it a few years ago -- said to  overlie 26 major geologic structures.    The legislation that completed creation of the wildlife refuge in 1980 also  ordered a separate study of the biology and the oil potential of the coastal  plain. A consortium of oil companies produced an optimistic report that led the  Ronald Reagan Administration to recommend in April, 1987, that the plain be  opened to oil exploration and development.    The pro-development report by then-Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel has  attracted almost as much debate as the coastal plain itself. Field biologists  at Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service complained that the report was  sanitized, understating the possibilities of environmental damage arising from  oil development.    The report conceded that the coastal plain has ""outstanding Arctic habitats  which support fish and wildlife species of national and international  significance."" But it concluded: ""The public interest demands that the area be  made available for oil and gas exploration and development. . . .""      200 Species Present    The plain has about 200 species of wildlife and fish, among them 500 musk oxen,  100 brown bears, a few dozen wolves, 325,000 geese and 300,000 other wildfowl.    But the chief concern is the Porcupine caribou herd, the continent's  sixth-largest migratory herd of caribou, officially estimated at 180,000  animals. They travel a route back and forth from a winter site in interior  Canada to the Wildlife Refuge for a 6- to 10-week period each summer.    Although another caribou herd appears to have prospered despite the huge oil  field developments at Prudhoe Bay about 100 miles to the west, the Porcupine  herd historically has used the coastal plain of the refuge as a calving ground.    Studies show that when the animals do not reach the plain to calve -- which  occurs if there is a late thaw, for instance -- there is a significantly higher  death rate among the offspring.    Protecting the normal calving ground has become a focus of the oil battle.  Another bill before Congress -- introduced by Rep. Walter B. Jones (D-N.C.),  chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee -- would open  most of the coastal plain but impose a 10-year moratorium on the calving ground  itself for further study.    In one example of the hazy scientific parameters of the debate, the very  existence of a particular calving ground within the refuge and its boundaries  is disputed. The whole concept was excised from the Interior Department report.  Most of the caribou have not even reached the plain to calve in the last two  years because of a late snow melt, biologists say.    But David Klein, a wildlife biologist at the University of Alaska who has  studied the Arctic for 30 years, says that the latest research on the Porcupine  herd bolsters the calving ground theory by showing that the forage there is  superior to that elsewhere.

0,FT923-8984 ,"FT923-8984 _AN-CHKBOAD1FT 920807   FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Developing the last great oil frontier - Western moves to exploit ex-Soviet reserves are gathering pace      By NEIL BUCKLEY and REUTER      MOSCOW   THE PROBLEMS and risks may still be legion, but moves by western companies to exploit oil reserves in the former Soviet Union are gathering pace. While the floodgates have yet to open, almost all major western companies have involvement of some kind - and a number of smaller companies have proved that they too can do deals with the former Soviet republics. Only this week, it was announced that a venture that is seeking to become the first integrated Russian oil company with a listing on the London stock exchange had been officially registered. The Siberian Oil Company (Sinco) has been formed by Eurosov Petroleum, a private company backed by US and Australian oil interests, together with 16 Russian shareholding enterprises. It has licences to exploit 20 fields in the Tyumen region with recoverable reserves estimated at 1.74bn barrels. Joint ventures with local producers remain the most popular means of entry into the former Soviet industry. The first was Yuganskfracmaster, made up of Canadian Fracmaster, Shell, and the west Siberian producer Yuganskneftegaz. This undertakes well treatment at fields in the Yugansk region and has managed to make satisfactory profits by exporting incremental oil production as payment for its work. The first US-Soviet venture to get approval to pump Siberian crude oil to the world, the much-trumpeted White Nights project, has had more variable fortunes. Formed in 1990 between US oil companies Phibro Energy and Anglo Suisse and the western Siberian producer Varyeganneftegaz, it began producing last year from the Tagrinskoye and West Varyegan fields near Raduzhny, 2,400 km (about 1,500 miles) north-east of Moscow. It was, however, hit hard by the high costs of employing expatriate workers and the effects of the Ecu26 a tonne (about Dollars 5 a barrel) export tariff imposed by the Russian government just before Christmas - from which it was only recently granted exemption. Undaunted, the White Nights partners are still preparing to embark on a bigger project, called Golden Mammoth, to develop four fields in western Siberia. Reserves are estimated at 400m barrels, and Mr Gil Labbe, president of Anglo-Suisse, recently said investment was planned of between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m. The recent offer by the Russian government to exempt 'serious' foreign investors from the punitive export tariff may help take the brakes off investment. Other joint ventures to benefit from exemption are Conoco's Polar Lights project, a Dollars 3bn development of three oil basins in the autonomous republic of Komi, west of the Ural mountains and close to the Arctic Circle. The other is KomiArcticOil, for which Gulf Canada is the operator, with partners British Gas and local producer Komineft. This has been producing about 8,000 b/d from Komi's Vozey and Upper Vozey fields since last December. Komi has been a centre of interest for western companies that are beginning to go beyond production-boosting agreements, to sign new exploration and development deals. Total, the French oil group, signed a production-sharing contract with Komineft in May, to develop the 250m-barrel Khariaga field in Komi's Timan Pechora basin. The company expects to invest Dollars 400m over two and a half years to bring the field on stream, and a total of Dollars 1bn over the life of the field. Occidental Petroleum, the US major, had long-established links with the former Soviet Union through its founder, Mr Armand Hammer, once a friend of Lenin. The company announced in June that a subsidiary, Occidental of the Republic of Komi, would begin exploration activities as soon as possible on a 1.5m-acre (600,000-hectare) block in the Timan Pechora basin, after winning exclusive exploration and exploitation rights with local petroleum enterprise Ukhtaneftegasgeologia. Another US major, Texaco, is negotiating a significant production-sharing agreement in Timan Pechora. Several other joint ventures have been announced since the demise of the Soviet Union. Pennzoil, the Texas-based natural resources company, said in January that it was forming a joint enterprise with Agansk Geological, to be called the Siberian American Oil company. The venture will develop the 45m-barrel West Mogotlorsk field in the Tyumen region of western Siberia - Russia's biggest oil-producing area. In the transition towards competitive tendering for licences, however, some companies are running into problems. Premier Consolidated Oilfields, the UK independent, secured exclusive rights to study the Caspian Sea's 100m-barrel Inchke More field last October and hoped this would lead to a full development contract. Instead, a competitive tender has been called, although Premier remains confident that its early work will give it a competitive advantage. Premier is not the first western company to find the rug apparently pulled from under its feet. The so-called 3M group, consisting of US companies Marathon Oil and McDermott and Japan's Mitsui, carried out a feasibility study on developing oil and gas offshore of Sakhalin island in the Russian far east. This was superseded by a competitive tender, only to see 3M come out the winners. There is, apparently, no such threat to the deals reached by the French major Elf Aquitaine, which was the first western company to sign significant exploration deals with both Russia and Kazakhstan, after nearly three years of painstaking negotiation. Elf has two blocks of almost 20,000 sq km (7,700 square miles) between the cities of Saratov and Volgograd in Russia, and south-west of Aktyubinsk in Kazakhstan. The Russian deal was recently ratified by the Russian parliament, and Elf has said it expects up to 20 per cent of its reserves to lie in these regions by the end of the century. In the race to attract western investment, Kazakhstan has scooped up by far the biggest deals. Three months after the Elf deal, it reached a long-awaited agreement with Chevron, the fourth largest oil company in the US, to develop the huge Tengiz and Korolev fields with estimated recoverable reserves between 6bn and 9bn barrels. Less than two months later, British Gas and Agip, the Italian state-owned oil company beat off competition from British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil to win exclusive negotiating rights to develop the Karachaganak field. The field contains 20 trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas, and 2bn barrels of oil and condensate. Kazakhstan also has deals with Oman and with the privately-owned Turkish engineering company United BMB group, which signed a Dollars 1.7bn deal to exploit four oilfields and construct a gas-fired power station at Aktyubinsk. Moreover, Mobil, BP and Chevron are said to be negotiating with Kazakhstan on the Tesh-Tali in the Caspian Sea. Kazakhstan's southern neighbour Uzbekistan also recently reached agreement with the Stan Cornelius Consortium, a group of US investors, to develop its Mingbulak field, with estimated reserves of 800m barrels. Even before the break up of the Soviet Union, the Caucasian republic of Azerbaijan, which also has extensive reserves,selected US major Amoco, together with partners Unocal and McDermott, to develop the Azeri field in the Caspian Sea, together with local producer Kaspmorneftegaz. Most experts agree that it will be the end of the century or beyond before these new ventures start producing enough oil to influence world crude prices. But the development of the last great oil frontier is well under way. This is the final part of a series on the oil sector of the former Soviet Union. Earlier articles appeared on July 24 and 31. THE RUSSIAN government has exempted some joint ventures in the key oil and natural gas sector from tough export taxes, but western companies and energy advisers in Moscow said the new rules did not go far enough, reports Reuter from Moscow. The rules, applying to joint ventures set up before January 1, 1992, say firms will not have to pay the tax until they have fully recovered initial investments on energy projects. 'It is certainly better than nothing, but it means there is not much hope any more for ventures registered this year,' said Mr Richard Lewis of Ernst and Young Vneshaudit in Moscow. 'Newer joint ventures will still be looking for help,' said another Western adviser. 'It is prohibitive to conduct business here with export tariffs so high.'  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

The  program is designed to retrieve as much as possible of the funds  spent on space research by promoting projects with realistic  economic prospects. Sheryl Riggins has more.    [Riggins] Finland's leading space researchers were out in  force on Monday [21 March] for the publication of the new space  research program. Finland does not plan to spend money on just  any project under the illustrious heading space, and Finns are  not seeking a spot for a Finnish astronaut on spaceflights.  Instead Finnish space research will be focusing on  down-to-earth projects with realistic applications.    Finnish scientists will be concentrating on three main areas  -- telecommunication satellites, remote mapping, and basic space  research. Finland already has extensive background in precisely  these areas of study. Remote mapping is a field of particular  interest, because it can bring significant economic rewards some  time in the future. Remote mapping is used, for instance, in  exploration for mineral deposits, charting timber reserves,  predicting the weather, and providing navigational assistance to  ships -- all of which are sellable services. The new national  space research strategy comes on the eve of Finland's entry into  the European Space Agency, ESA. Joining the club [as heard]  will cost about 100 million marks a year. The Finnish space  researchers believe that at least that much can be earned in  industrial orders.     "

GEOGRAPHIC'S WONDROUS YEARS SHOWN IN EXHIBIT      By CORINNE FLOCKEN      You'll find them in almost every garage, stashed between the rusty garden tools  and the old bowling trophies: chronicles of our planet's religions, political  upheavals, tragedies and triumphs, all neatly stacked according to date and  tucked into crumbling cardboard boxes.    Literally and figuratively, the National Geographic magazine has staying power.  Founded in 1888 by a covey of Washington's most influential folk, the National  Geographic Society was established to facilitate ""the increase and diffusion of  geographical knowledge,"" and has since become the world's largest nonprofit  scientific and educational institution. The society celebrates a century-plus  of achievement in ""National Geographic Society: 100 Years of Adventure and  Discovery,"" a traveling exhibit on view through Nov. 11 at the Fullerton Museum  Center.    A product of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES),  the show features 161 color and black-and-white photographs that trace the  society's work through the years, from its backing of Commander Peary's  exploration of the North Pole to its ongoing funding of global conservation  programs. Fullerton Museum exhibition administrator Lynn LaBate has  supplemented the photos with artifacts from the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana and  vintage cameras from the California Museum of Photography at UC Riverside, many  of them similar to those used by early National Geographic photographers. In  addition, on Nov. 3, the museum will present a program of international stories  for grade-school children, and on Nov. 2 and 9, evenings of Andean folk tunes  and Brazilian contemporary popular music. There is an additional charge for  these events.    In the museum's video room, some of the society's most popular television  documentaries will run through the end of the show. Included are ""National  Parks: Playground or Paradise?"" (through Saturday), ""Bali, Masterpieces of the  Gods"" (Oct. 28 through Nov. 3) and ""African Wildlife"" (Nov. 4 through 11).    Of course, the society has been bringing remote corners of the world into our  living rooms long before the advent of television. In the late 1800s and early  1900s, the group was instrumental in the exploration of the poles, as well as  southern Alaska and Canada. Chronicled in murky black-and-white photos are the  struggles of Commander Peary and his party as they tackled huge snowdrifts on  their first expedition to the North Pole, and the first flight over the South  Pole by Commander Richard Byrd, which was funded by society grants in 1928-30.  To date, the National Geographic Society has funded more than 3,300 research  projects worldwide.    Through the magazine, the society has helped readers keep pace with these  advancements. The first issue, printed in October, 1888, was a highly technical  journal sent to 165 members. Photographs first appeared in 1910, and in 1920,  the now-familiar yellow border became standard on each cover. Today, the  magazine reaches an estimated 40 million people.    Along the way, magazine readers have followed the group's wildlife preservation  efforts, noted in the show by a large photo of African elephants resting in  Namibia's Estoshe National Park; they've sighed over the wreckage of 100  natural disasters, detailed here with dramatic shots of the 1906 San Francisco  earthquake and an aerial view of Mt. St. Helen's, one year after its 1980  eruption. They've traveled vicariously on far-flung expeditions, such as the  1920s trip to Chinese and Tibetan borderlands, captured here in a tranquil shot  of a Tibetan holy man calling his brother monks to prayer. Adventures into the  greatest heights and depths are recalled with photographs of U.S. space travel  and of the 1985 discovery of the ill-fated Titanic.    The society's pioneering use of photography is outlined as well, ranging from a  moody 1916 shot using Lumiere autochrome, the first commercial color photo  process, to a series of holograms from the mid-1980s. Vintage cameras on view  include a 1927 Tropice, a wood-and-metal model suitable for use in tropical  climates, and a Revolving Back Auto Graflex, popular among traveling  photographers between 1904 and 1940.    But the most powerful photographs in the show can be found in two large photo  montages in the museum's smaller gallery. Images here range from a 1968 shot of  a Vietnamese mother pleading for her sick child, to a 1915 photo of an Ifugao  headhunter showing off his latest prize. A chilling 1922 shot shows a Mongolian  woman locked in a small wooden box, sentenced to die of starvation.     The Fullerton Museum Center, 301 N.

GEOGRAPHIC'S WONDROUS YEARS SHOWN IN EXHIBIT      By CORINNE FLOCKEN      You'll find them in almost every garage, stashed between the rusty garden tools  and the old bowling trophies: chronicles of our planet's religions, political  upheavals, tragedies and triumphs, all neatly stacked according to date and  tucked into crumbling cardboard boxes.    Literally and figuratively, the National Geographic magazine has staying power.  Founded in 1888 by a covey of Washington's most influential folk, the National  Geographic Society was established to facilitate ""the increase and diffusion of  geographical knowledge,"" and has since become the world's largest nonprofit  scientific and educational institution. The society celebrates a century-plus  of achievement in ""National Geographic Society: 100 Years of Adventure and  Discovery,"" a traveling exhibit on view through Nov. 11 at the Fullerton Museum  Center.    A product of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES),  the show features 161 color and black-and-white photographs that trace the  society's work through the years, from its backing of Commander Peary's  exploration of the North Pole to its ongoing funding of global conservation  programs. Fullerton Museum exhibition administrator Lynn LaBate has  supplemented the photos with artifacts from the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana and  vintage cameras from the California Museum of Photography at UC Riverside, many  of them similar to those used by early National Geographic photographers. In  addition, on Nov. 3, the museum will present a program of international stories  for grade-school children, and on Nov. 2 and 9, evenings of Andean folk tunes  and Brazilian contemporary popular music. There is an additional charge for  these events.    In the museum's video room, some of the society's most popular television  documentaries will run through the end of the show. Included are ""National  Parks: Playground or Paradise?"" (through Saturday), ""Bali, Masterpieces of the  Gods"" (Oct. 28 through Nov. 3) and ""African Wildlife"" (Nov. 4 through 11).    Of course, the society has been bringing remote corners of the world into our  living rooms long before the advent of television. In the late 1800s and early  1900s, the group was instrumental in the exploration of the poles, as well as  southern Alaska and Canada. Chronicled in murky black-and-white photos are the  struggles of Commander Peary and his party as they tackled huge snowdrifts on  their first expedition to the North Pole, and the first flight over the South  Pole by Commander Richard Byrd, which was funded by society grants in 1928-30.  To date, the National Geographic Society has funded more than 3,300 research  projects worldwide.    Through the magazine, the society has helped readers keep pace with these  advancements. The first issue, printed in October, 1888, was a highly technical  journal sent to 165 members. Photographs first appeared in 1910, and in 1920,  the now-familiar yellow border became standard on each cover. Today, the  magazine reaches an estimated 40 million people.    Along the way, magazine readers have followed the group's wildlife preservation  efforts, noted in the show by a large photo of African elephants resting in  Namibia's Estoshe National Park; they've sighed over the wreckage of 100  natural disasters, detailed here with dramatic shots of the 1906 San Francisco  earthquake and an aerial view of Mt. St. Helen's, one year after its 1980  eruption. They've traveled vicariously on far-flung expeditions, such as the  1920s trip to Chinese and Tibetan borderlands, captured here in a tranquil shot  of a Tibetan holy man calling his brother monks to prayer. Adventures into the  greatest heights and depths are recalled with photographs of U.S. space travel  and of the 1985 discovery of the ill-fated Titanic.    The society's pioneering use of photography is outlined as well, ranging from a  moody 1916 shot using Lumiere autochrome, the first commercial color photo  process, to a series of holograms from the mid-1980s. Vintage cameras on view  include a 1927 Tropice, a wood-and-metal model suitable for use in tropical  climates, and a Revolving Back Auto Graflex, popular among traveling  photographers between 1904 and 1940.    But the most powerful photographs in the show can be found in two large photo  montages in the museum's smaller gallery. Images here range from a 1968 shot of  a Vietnamese mother pleading for her sick child, to a 1915 photo of an Ifugao  headhunter showing off his latest prize. A chilling 1922 shot shows a Mongolian  woman locked in a small wooden box, sentenced to die of starvation.     The Fullerton Museum Center, 301 N. Pomona Ave., presents ""National Geographic  Society: 100 Years of Adventure and Discovery,"" an exhibit of 161 color and  black-and-white photographs, through Nov. 11.

STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER      LONDON      When environmental ministers arrive here next week to wrap up a major  conference on protecting the ozone layer, none will have more work cut out for  them than William K. Reilly.    Reilly, chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, may well become the  focus of attention -- and the court of last resort -- for many countries here  who are urging the United States to change its position on a number of problems  that have threatened the harmony of the conference.    At stake are major amendments to a three-year-old international accord to  protect the Earth's ozone layer from being stripped away by man-made chemicals.  The existing accord, known as the Montreal Protocol, calls for a 50% phase-out  of those chemicals in industrialized countries by the year 2000.    There is wide agreement that these steps are half-hearted and that there must  be a 100% phase-out by the year 2000 -- perhaps as soon as 1997 -- of chemicals  already covered by the protocol. Further, new chemicals not now controlled must  be covered.      The Background    Of particular concern are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons. CFCs are used  as cooling agents in air conditioners and refrigerators, as blowing agents in  the manufacturer of foam, and as cleaning agents for electronic components.  Halons are used in fire extinguishers.    Over a period of time, they percolate into the stratosphere and are broken down  by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. This releases a chlorine atom, which in  turn devours up to 100,000 ozone atoms. That is the chemical reaction that is  drilling a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica and is thinning the layer  over the North Pole and over North America and Europe.    On these issues there is little disagreement.    The rub comes in establishing a new executive committee of 15 to dispense about  $240 million in funds to help Third World countries afford the more expensive  chemical substitutes for CFCs and halons that do less harm to the ozone layer.    Meeting on the banks of the Thames across from Parliament, lower-ranking  delegates from 75 nations have been laboring since Wednesday to lay the  groundwork for these changes and to reach a consensus to present to the  environmental ministers next week.    But in the first three days of the working sessions, the United States has  found itself largely isolated by its insistence that it be awarded a permanent  seat on the new executive committee and that nations contributing the most  money to the fund be given more votes on the committee.    The issue has stirred indignation from Third World countries -- the so-called  Group of 77 -- because it is the executive committee that will decide which  developing nations receive funds and how they will be used. The U.S. proposal  was a ""bombshell,"" in the words of India's delegate, Mahesh Prasad, secretary  of the Ministry of Environment.    On Friday, China urged the United States to ""radically"" alter course, strongly  hinting that if the American position won out, China -- with 20% of the world's  population and a tremendous potential to help or hinder the cause of ozone  protection -- would refuse to sign the protocol.    Third World countries are holding out for equal representation on the committee  along the lines called for by Mostafa K. Tolba, executive director of the  United Nations Environment Program, which is sponsoring the conference.    Tolba has called for a 15-member committee made up of seven representatives  from Third World countries and seven from industrialized nations. They, in  turn, would elect a chairman, who would become the 15th member.      What the Americans Want    American delegates have been instructed by Washington to hold fast to that  position on grounds that the United States would be contributing 25% of the  fund -- more than any other country. Japan would be second, contributing 11  1/2%. ""That does not seem unreasonable,"" an EPA aide said.    The United States also wants to be given credit against its 25% share if it  sends foreign aid directly to another country to help it switch to more  desirable chemical substitutes.    But, in an interview, Prasad of India said a committee controlled by the  industrialized West may make mistakes in allocating the funds and specifying  ways they are to be used.    Reilly will also hear arguments, dealing with issues not of procedure but of  trust and national sovereignty, delegates from the Third World say. Reilly is  scheduled to meet with President Bush on Monday before arriving here Tuesday.    While nothing has been said in London about the Third World countries voting as  a bloc to deny the two-thirds vote required for approving amendments to  strengthen the protocol, a number of delegates, including one from Britain,  said that the veto is in the back of everyone's mind.    At this point, it is unclear whether Reilly will bring with him additional  authority to negotiate. But Washington is getting daily diplomatic reports on  the sentiment here.    What Washington is being told is that it may once again be alone on an  environmental issue of global significance, just as it was until last week,  when it changed its position and belatedly agreed to contribute money to the  proposed $240-million ozone depletion fund to assist Third World nations in  joining the fight to close the ozone hole.

0,FT924-7658 ,"FT924-7658 _AN-CKOAUAECFT 921114   FT  14 NOV 92 / Practical Traveller: Culture and jelly in Tripoli      By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL   A YEAR ago I joined a nine-day Swan Hellenic art treasures tour of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica - Libya to you. It was extremely well-run. Occasionally tiring, maybe, for someone like me, whose mind wanders easily and whose visits to archaeological sites have to be strictly rationed if I am not to die of ennui; but it packed a great deal in. The visit was run in association with the British Museum and offered keen value at Pounds 1,675 per person (single room supplement: Pounds 15 per night). Sissie Chan, Swan Hellenic's marketing director, was there to keep a minder's eye on me. Every time I flagged she gave me a book to read or ordered a plate of jelly. And I was constantly startled by the skill of the guest lecturer, Dr Susan Walker, assistant keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, in noticing that my attention could generally be revived with a bit of classical statuary or incongruous note-swapping on films and modern novels. In addition, there was the itinerary itself: Tripoli, Sabratha, Leptis Magna, Benghazi, Al Beida, Cyrene, Apollonia, Tripoli - all much enjoyed by the enthusiasts who jostle to join such trips. Swan Hellenic is the UK market leader for cultural tours and cruises. It has nearly 40 years' experience, having organised its first Mediterranean cruise in 1954. It runs a well-rounded programme: cruises to virtually everywhere, including the Nile and European rivers; and land-based art and natural history tours. It even has a brochure of Christmas and winter breaks covering 14 destinations. Examples: eight days in Rome, December 21-28, Pounds 1,390; eight in Madrid, same dates, Pounds 1,275; seven in Prague, December 21-27, Pounds 1,650; and nine in Sri Lanka, February 14-22 1993, Pounds 1,175. The single room supps are Pounds 15 per night (Rome), Pounds 39 per night (Madrid), Pounds 69 per night (Prague) and Pounds 16 per night (Sri Lanka). The company says it has combined new ports and sites with traditional itineraries for next year's Mediterranean cruises. There are 18 different ones, all accompanied by experts in history, art, architecture and archaeology. Prices start from Pounds 1,450, including flights, transfers, accommodation, meals and excursions. There is a no-tipping policy aboard its cruise ship, the Orpheus. One of next year's cruises (June 16-30, from Pounds 1,580) is due to make a one-day stop at Tripoli for excursions to Sabratha or Leptis Magna. And there are two land tours of Libya pencilled in next year (13 days each, May 13-25 and September 16-28, Pounds 2,695). Swan Hellenic's natural history tours next year include Madagascar (14 days, Pounds 2,850), Tanzania (13 days, Pounds 2,450), Patagonia (19 days, Pounds 3,275), and Antarctica and the Falkland Islands (17 days, Pounds 5,495 for an outside twin-bedded cabin on Discoverer Deck of Clipper's World Discoverer; other prices available). London tel: 071-831-1515 for Swan Hellenic Mediterranean and Nile cruises; 071-831-1616 for land tours and European river cruises. The British Museum itself has a division, British Museum Tours (tel: 071-323-8895 or 071-323-1234), which runs a full programme, drawing on curators' expertise and covering art, archaeology, history and ethnography. All tours are accompanied by a museum-appointed lecturer and a tour manager. Examples next year: Easter Island and Tahiti (February 7-21, Pounds 2,930, single supp Pounds 105); Medieval Bohemia (May 12-18, Pounds 1,180, single supp Pounds 195); Indonesia: Sumatra, Java, Bali (July 29-August 18, Pounds 2,304, single supp Pounds 372), and Syria (October 19-November 3, Pounds 1,950, single supp Pounds 342). Among larger operators, many of which try to include cultural jaunts somewhere in their brochures, is Bales Tours, owned and run by the experienced Bales family (George, Molly, Anthony, Joanna, Mandy, Jane), which has a full range of escorted tours. Examples next year: Jordan and the Holy Land, 19 days, Pounds 1,895; Moghul India, 16 days, Pounds 1,695, and China, 10-21 days, with various extensions and prices. All tours have numerous departure dates. Tel: 0306-885991/876881. Two other specialist companies are Prospect (081-995-2151), which also runs opera and music holidays; and Jasmin Tours (0628-850788). Hardened culture vultures can easily organise their own short or long breaks. Among the best city brochures is that of British Airways Holidays (44 cities on three continents; prices from Pounds 149 for two nights in Paris; new additions for 1993: Bruges, Faro and Salzburg, starting from Pounds 177, Pounds 187 and Pounds 279 for two nights respectively; 0293-615353/061-493-3344). Another good city brochure is Travelscene's (081-427-4445). The company reports marked growth this year in short-break travel to less-well-established centres, partly because of boredom with longer summer sun holidays but also because oldies, many of them fairly well insulated by their pensions against recession, have been skipping off on city breaks.

0,FT911-5079 ,"FT911-5079 _AN-BDPBVAD7FT 910416   FT  16 APR 91 / Argentine ambitions founder off Tierra del Fuego: An ill-conceived scheme to promote industrial development at the ends of the earth      By JOHN BARHAM   IN 1972 Argentine strategists announced that security and geopolitical priorities made it essential to establish a large permanent settlement on the remote island of Tierra del Fuego, which is divided between Argentina and Chile. They decided to establish a duty-free zone and offered tax incentives to attract industry. Nineteen years and millions of dollars later, the ill-conceived plan is finally being abandoned as Argentina embraces free trade. As a result, Ushuaia and Rio Grande, the population of the island's only towns, are shrinking daily. Ushuaia, a port of about 30,000 people set between the Beagle Channel and the southernmost ranges of the Andes, became home to five screwdriver plants notorious for their poorly crafted and over-priced consumer durables. Now, the end of incentives and the advent of trade liberalisation could spell the end for the factories and the 5,000 jobs they provide. Mr Hugo Iglesias, general manager of Bencer SA, Ushuaia's largest company, said 'if our protection from imports is ended I would say it spells the end for the economic development of Tierra del Fuego. Companies will implode.' Recession has already reduced sales severely and most factories operate at only 20 per cent of capacity. If the industrialisation of Tierra del Fuego made little economic sense, it has at least eased the worries of Argentina's military planners. Strategists in Buenos Aires have always been anxious to settle Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego because they suspect Chile covets the under-populated but resource-rich region. Hardy Chilean immigrants, who do the menial and labouring jobs the Argentines refuse to do, have always been in a majority. At one time about 90 per cent of Argentine Tierra del Fuego's population was Chilean. Now it is estimated at 'only' 60 per cent. In 1978 the two countries, then run by right-wing military governments, almost went to war over control of the Beagle Channel. The immediate 'threat' from Chile faded following Argentina's acceptance in 1984 of Papal arbitration awarding three minuscule islands in the Beagle Channel to Chile. However, Argentine Tierra del Fuego is trying to assert a new strategic importance as the focal point of Argentina's territorial claims in Antarctica and the South Atlantic. Formally, Tierra del Fuego has 'jurisdiction' over a region covering 495,000 square miles, which includes the Falkland Islands, three other British-held island groups in the South Atlantic as well as a section of Antarctica. Maps of the region carry the legend 'Tierra del Fuego - geographical centre of a country we must consolidate.' However, the virtually insolvent government in Buenos Aires has little time for Tierra del Fuego's territorial ambitions. It can no longer afford to sustain the expensive and notoriously corrupt incentives schemes. On April 1, the duty free zone became practically meaningless when the government replaced formerly insurmountable trade barriers to imported electronic goods with a single 22 per cent tariff as part of a general trade liberalisation policy. Overnight, Tierra del Fuego was priced out of the market. A 20-inch television set made on the island retailed in Buenos Aires for Dollars 855 (Pounds 483). A similar set imported from Japan and sold in the Chilean half of Tierra del Fuego, which is also a duty free zone, retails for less than half the price. Naturally, there are few homes in Ushuaia equipped with locally-made goods. Mr Mario Muia, manager of Continental SACIF, which makes televisions, video cassette recorders and audio systems, said Tierra del Fuego 'is not a good deal any more. It's practically impossible to compete with imports.' Mr Muia, who admits to being the proud owner of an imported Sony stereo, warned darkly of 'social disaster' on the island unless the trade policy was reversed. However, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, retorts that the companies have 90 per cent profit margins, and says there is scope for them to compete. Less charitable observers say the companies made even larger profits by manipulating the incentive regulations. There is little else to sustain the island's economy. Buenos Aires, its only market, lies thousands of kilometres away at the other end of a highway which includes long stretches of rutted and potholed dirt roads that are closed for weeks in the winter. Most of the island's food is sent from Buenos Aires, although it is fertile and its waters abound in fish. If the screwdriver plants do close, what will become of Tierra del Fuego? Before, it was home to thousands of sheep, a prison colony and a naval base. Tourism, the region's boosters say, is the obvious alternative. Indeed, on a hill overlooking the Beagle Channel, Ushuaia's first five star hotel and casino is under construction.  The Financial Times   London Page 6 Map (Omitted).  "

The job of chief executive of the Falkland Islands government is up for grabs. It pays well - Pounds 50,000 a year - and there are the usual perks, unlimited fishing, rough shooting, free limo etc . . . Ronald Sampson, the boss since April 1989, is leaving when his contract expires. He's returning to the family home at Stratford upon Avon, so far without any other job lined up. Faced with the messy task of untangling 20-odd companies involved in a fishing fiasco, which left the Falkland Islands with losses of some Pounds 25m, he's acquitted himself well. 'We've been scandal-free for five years,' he adds - no mean achievement given the islands' history. Potential replacements will be required to strut their stuff in front of an interviewing board consisting of Sampson; Sukey Cameron, the islands government's London representative; Gordon Jewkes, a former governor; a bod from the Foreign Office; and Paul Stevenson, former Royal Marines' commander. The job involves managing 200 civil servants (10 per cent of the population) and representing the islands in commercial and overseas contexts. It could be a particularly sensitive post given the flurry of excitement over the islands' oil potential, although exploration is unlikely to start before 1995. Sounds like just the sort of challenge for Bob Horton, the deposed boss of British Petroleum, if he were not tied up back home trying to make sure that Britain's railway privatisation runs on time.

The largest minority shareholder, Canadian 88 Energy, yesterday raised the value of its own counter offer for the company, Texaco Canada Petroleum. The independent exploration and production company also reaffirmed it would reject the Texaco offer. Mr Greg Noval, president of Canadian 88, said Texaco needed the support of holders of at least half the remaining 22 per cent before it could mount a compulsory buy-out of all the shares. On that basis, Canadian 88, which in the last two weeks has built its stake in Texaco Canada to 9.8 per cent, requires only a few other shareholders to thwart the US group's plans. Texaco's offer of CDollars 1.40 a share for the 22 per cent of the Canadian company it does not already own was countered by a CDollars 1.60-a-share offer from Canadian 88. Yesterday, the Canadian independent, with market capitalisation of CDollars 125m (USDollars 91.4m), lifted its offer to CDollars 1.65 a share, valuing Texaco Canada at CDollars 208m. Mr Noval said the bid was a genuine attempt to acquire the company, and not simply a move to force Texaco to increase its own offer. The dispute centres on the value of Texaco Canada's assets, which include an interest in a partnership which owns gas assets in British Columbia and direct ownership of oil reserves in Alberta.

No, not coal - oil. According to an article in the Oil and Gas Journal, the US oil industry's bible, Her Majesty could be sitting on top of one of Britain's biggest onshore oilfields. Desmond Oswald, boss of the little-known Canuk Exploration, has been poking around underneath the castle for the past four years. He believes that as many as 100m barrels of oil may be trapped in a reservoir which begins only 1,000 feet below the Castle. Little is known about Canuk, based in Gerrards Cross, but other oil industry sources say the idea is not as barmy as it sounds. Oswald expresses surprise that 'such a large structure should have remained undrilled in a country where extensive exploration has taken place'. Having done his homework, he is now seeking a competent operator to contribute financially to the drilling of an exploratory well. Of course, the royals may not be amused at the thought of nodding donkeys taking their place alongside the Household Cavalry. But times have changed.

After the discovery of unauthorised payments to store fuel in tankers offshore, NNPC's managing director, Mr Edmund Daukoru, finance director Mr O. Okwara, and company secretary Dr Beneni Briggs were arrested last month. Mr Daukoru, Mr Okwara and five other senior officials were formally charged yesterday with stealing Dollars 41m. About 20 senior officials in NNPC have been suspended. The plan to charter two very large vessels for storing about 1m tonnes of fuel through Lenoil, an independent oil and marketing company, was approved by Mr Chu Okongwu, who was oil minister in 1992. Although each ship was costing Nigeria an estimated Dollars 49,000 a day, the so-called strategic reserve never supplied any fuel. Nigeria has adequate storage capacity on shore but its fuel shortages stem from large-scale smuggling, and crumbling refineries and distribution systems run by subsidiaries of NNPC. Mr Philip Asiodu, who became oil minister in January this year, rejected the chartering scheme and ordered instead the purchase of smaller tankers secondhand, also through Lenoil. Although Mr Asiodu blocked a demand by Lenoil for Dollars 62m, it is alleged that most of the payment went through shortly after he left office in August, leading to the arrest of the NNPC directors. Mr Len Adesanya, managing director of Lenoil, was also arrested. Mr Adesanya was to be in the new management following the takeover of Texaco Nigeria in July. The deal was opposed by the minority Nigerian shareholders, who allege that the buyer, TNP Holdings, registered in the British Virgin Islands, was funded indirectly by the military regime. The takeover is under investigation by Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission. Industry analysts say that close links between Mr Adesanya's operations and Mr Babangida's military regime went right to the top and that Lenoil was one of the two main operators in the smuggling of about 100,000 barrels a day of fuel. Since Mr Don Etiebet took over as petroleum minister in late August, the boards of NNPC and its refining and marketing subsidiaries have been dissolved, and the axe has fallen on several other deals agreed by his predecessor. Mr Etiebet has cancelled all the crude oil lifting contracts signed by Mr Asiodu. Mr Etiebet said the contracts were to be renegotiated because 'people are hawking crude oil . . . we want to know the exact number of people who are lifting and whether they comply with our objectives'. Mr Etiebet has invited new applications to buy Nigerian crude oil from companies established internationally as traders or refiners of oil products or which are investing in upstream exploration in Nigeria. The minister has also invited tenders to supply fuel from internationally recognised companies. The minister has cancelled 16 oil exploration licences awarded by Mr Asiodu to indigenous prospecting companies. According to industry sources, the approvals were rushed through without the normal procedures and many of the licencees do not have the technology or resources to carry out exploration. NNPC's acting managing director is reviewing the sale of an extra 5 per cent stake in an oil production venture to one of its equity partners, Elf Aquitaine, for around Dollars 520m. The joint venture is operated by Shell and produces half of Nigeria's 1.8m b/d oil output. July's sale to Elf broke the 40 per cent limit on foreign ownership in oil joint ventures. The private sector in Nigeria and international creditors would like to see the shake-up in NNPC go further. Recommendations by an economic conference chaired by Mr Ernest Shonekan in February, which included a reduction in state control of the oil and gas industry, have not been implemented. In a follow-up to that conference today the private sector will press for the measures to be passed in the January budget. The budget monitoring committee set up by Mr Shonekan to review government spending under the Babangida regime has submitted the report. The document is highly critical of dedication accounts that diverted about 110,000 barrels of oil from central revenue into offshore accounts. Mr Shonekan has made transparency in government revenue one of his government's main target, but he has yet to show that he can bring oil revenue under control.

However, operating profit fell slightly over the same period to Dollars 223m in the quarter to September 30, from Dollars 228m. Exploration costs more than doubled to Dollars 122m in the first nine months, part of the company's ambitious investment plans over the next 10 years. Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF president and chief executive, said the rise in net income was due to 'higher crude oil production and prices, higher natural gas prices and lower asset taxes'. However, increased depreciation and exploration spending kept operating income flat. In the first nine months, net revenue from sales slipped 1.3 per cent to Dollars 2.99bn, partly as a result of 'weather problems' in the second quarter, but in the third quarter revenue was up by 3.8 per cent to Dollars 1.09bn. YPF denied local press reports that it had made an oil discovery in Rincon de los Sauces, in Argentina's central Neuquen basin, but it did confirm that it was exploring the area. Mr Christopher Ecclestone of brokers Interacciones said the results were 'good at the bottom line' but that YPF was 'losing position in some areas' with lower sales of gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. He also pointed out that bottom-line results were helped by taxes of only Dollars 2m against Dollars 14m a year ago.   Companies:-  Yacimientos Peroliferos Fiscales Sociedad del Estado YPF.

The company argues that it has long had plans to retrench, but that without a clear regulatory framework it was unable to act. Yet the gas business has not had the kind of technological change which has, for example, transformed BT's manning needs. Nor can the Pounds 1.65bn restructuring cost have been an excuse for avoiding the issue, since the operation has an enviable 50 per cent rate of return. The suspicion must be that if these people are not needed now, they have not been needed since the company was privatised. It seems the monopoly was comfortably immovable until it was hit by the irresistible force that is Sir James McKinnon. Nor has British Gas found relief from regulatory pressure. In the medium term, the RPI-4 price cap and continued loss of market share will be hard to offset, even with these cuts. Gearing is still rising, despite a 27 per cent fall in capital expenditure on exploration and production. The sale of Consumers Gas in Canada will broadly cover the restructuring costs, but that only underlines how international ambitions will have to become more selective. A 5.4 per cent yield on the shares offers some defence. Even so, it is hard to see how real dividend increases can be sustained if the aim really is for a twice-covered payout.

By 27 December, the China Petroleum and Natural Gas  Corporation had fully met its state plan for the output of oil  and natural gas, and the total annual output of crude oil was  139.2 million tons, 1.037 million tons above last year's figure,  and the natural gas output was 15.4 billion cubic meters, up 290  million cubic meters from last year. The China Offshore  Petroleum Corporation produced 4.60 million tons of crude oil,  up 0.73 million tons from last year. This outstanding  accomplishment enabled China to maintain its rising position  among the world's main petroleum producers.    Beginning this year, the continental oil fields brought  about  a favorable situation in which east and west are keeping pace  with each other. The eastern region, as represented by the  Daqing oil field, vigorously implemented the ""stable oil output  and control of water consumption"" system engineering project and  posted an annual output of 55.90 million tons of crude oil, up  0.244 million tons from last year. In the west, all oil fields  strove to create favorable conditions, increasing their crude  oil output by 1.739 million tons compared with last year.

0,FT924-9875 ,"FT924-9875 _AN-CKCCTAGJFT 921103   FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (6): North Sea mid-life crisis - Britain's offshore activity has passed its peak      By NEIL BUCKLEY   SOME say the North Sea oil industry is suffering a mid-life crisis from which it will soon recover; others that it has begun a terminal decline. The signals are, admittedly, confusing. Events such as the lay-off of 1,300 workers at McDermott Scotland's construction yard near Inverness have hit the headlines, along with warnings of further redundancies amid gloomy forecasts of workloads for UK yards over the next two years. MPs and some oil companies have called, unsuccessfully, for a change in the North Sea tax regime to bring forward new developments. Mr David Bramley of consultants Arthur D Little says the likely lack of interest in this year's 14th UK licensing round could be something of a watershed in the evolution of the North Sea, marking its transition into a mature and ultimately declining production area. On a more positive note, two surveys in August forecast a bright future. Grampian Region Council's Update of Oil and Gas Prospects said the North Sea would see substantial activity and production for at least 25 years, even though overall levels of employment might fall. More than 90 new fields were likely to be developed in that time, 15 in the next two and a half years. Arthur Anderson Petroleum Services predicted capital spending in the North Sea in the next three years would be almost Pounds 18bn, 55 per cent more than in the previous three years. Oil production was predicted to reach another peak of between 2.5m and 2.8m barrels a day by 1995. Gas production was seen rising steadily from 5.1bn cubic feet a day to 9.2bn cubic feet a day by the end of the century, when it would account for 45 per cent of offshore output. An earlier survey by County NatWest WoodMac identified 57 probable developments already on the books, with recoverable reserves of 2.3bn barrels of oil and 14,300bn cubic feet of gas. Oil companies, too, claim to be positive about the North Sea. Mr Chris Gibson-Smith, chief executive, Europe, of BP Exploration, told a Financial Times conference on the future of the North Sea earlier this year that he believed it would have 'at least two decades more of active life'. The majors stress that it will continue to be a mainstay of their programme despite their moves into frontier areas. They say the North Sea is a known quantity, with a stable political situation and a tax regime that has been relatively supportive of new developments and of exploration investment. It also benefits from a highly-developed infrastructure. These advantages contrast with the political risks, the lack of infrastructure, and the local hazards - ranging from bandits in Colombia to unexploded mines in Vietnam - they confront in frontier regions. But there is no doubt the nature of the North Sea is changing. While most industry experts believe there are at least 10bn barrels of oil yet to be discovered, the average size of new field discoveries has declined dramatically from the 2bn-barrel giants of the early 1970s to 50m barrels or less today. 'It is the same for all exploration provinces in the world,' says Mr Harold Hughes, director-general of the UK Offshore Operators Association. 'You find the big ones first, but then you are down to the needle in a haystack variety.' In a climate of low oil prices, many new fields are on the fringes of economic viability. To develop them will call for important changes in oil companies' working methods to cut costs - which have increased considerably in recent years - from the exploration stage right through to production. This may explain the slight uncertainty that hangs over the industry. Mr Gibson-Smith said he thought the oil industry had 'not yet completed the process of adjustment to marginal economics and sector maturity. Much of the recent activity has been a function of earlier expectations and decisions.' Operators are, however, starting to adapt. They are already making use of recent advances in technology that should make development of presently marginal fields possible in the future. At the exploration stage, this means increasing use of three-dimensional seismic surveys to produce more accurate geological models of oil and gas structures than has ever been possible before and increase the effectiveness of both appraisal and development drilling. More precise information also aids the effective use of another technological development: horizontal drilling. A single horizontal well can be many times as effective as a traditional vertical well, and in itself can make the difference between a field being economic or uneconomic to develop. There are other ways in which field developments will change. The days of giant platforms with 200-strong crews - and of several manned platforms exploiting the same field - are numbered. Shell/Esso's Gannet field development, 112 miles east of Aberdeen, is a good example. Three subsea satellites, instead of the three separate platforms originally envisaged, are tied back to a single large deck capable of processing 50,000 barrels of oil and 180m cubic feet of gas a day but with an operational crew of only 20 people. Shell is also de-manning all but three of its 17 platforms in the southern gas basin. On the Leman field, the North Sea's first producing gas field launched in 1967, the number of crew living offshore will be halved by 1996, with gas processing moved from satellite platforms to central compression complexes. Mr Chris Fay, managing director of Shell Expro, has said such changes in practice meant Shell was likely to cut about 4,700 offshore and onshore jobs by the end of the decade. In addition to subsea satellites and unmanned platforms, the industry is expected to make more use of floating production facilities. Amerada Hess has led the way with its Angus development, a field of less than 10m barrels being exploited through the Petrojarl, a specially-modified floating production, storage and offloading vessel. Mr Sam Laidlaw has a vision of floating production vessels criss-crossing the North Sea by the end of the decade, being reused on different fields. Independents Kerr McGee, Clyde, Santa Fe and Aran recently purchased the ship-shaped Tentech floating production vessel with which they hope to develop the 100m-barrel Gryphon field in under a year. Many independents believe the changing nature of the North Sea makes it less attractive to the majors, while they can benefit by taking more flexible and innovative approaches. At the same time, however, the era of custom-designed platforms - which, industry insiders admit, were sometimes over-designed - is coming to an end. More standardisation and streamlining of platforms and equipment will be necessary to cut costs. Working practices and inter-company attitudes will also have to change to bring costs down, analysts say. In what could prove a model agreement, eight companies with interests in six adjacent blocks in the Clair area - Amoco, BP, Chevron, Conoco, Elf, Enterprise, Esso, and Mobil - agreed last year to drill appraisal wells and carry out future work on a joint basis. Mr Bramley of Arthur D Little says companies are becoming more willing to talk to one another and share information, and have been cooperating in benchmarking exercises to compare their costs. However, despite the overall decline in field sizes, some believe the days of the giant discoveries may not be entirely over. There is still the possibility, says Mr Sam Laidlaw, of 'looking for a needle in a haystack and finding the farmer's daughter'.  The Financial Times   London Page IV  "

Endowed with an estimated 4.9bn barrels of recoverable reserves, the country continued pumping during 16 years of fierce civil war, which officially ended less than a year ago. Oil kept the Angolan economy afloat. Now, with new offshore fields being opened to exploration and investment, and more than 500,000 barrels of crude being produced a day, Angola is consolidating its position as sub-Saharan Africa's second largest producer, after Nigeria. But such 'rich' developing countries have fears too, many of which were voiced this month in Luanda, the Angolan capital, at an oil and gas conference aimed at encouraging co-operation between African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) nations and the European Community. ACP oil producers are worried that a lack of adequate training, a shortage of international investment capital, and global environmental pressures may hamper their economic development. 'Countries with large energy resources can't always extract the benefits,' said Mr Fernando Jose Franca Van Dunen, the Angolan prime minister, in his opening address. 'If they are not accompanied by technical transfers, and proper support, more problems, more economic disaster and more poverty can be provoked. Give us help in drawing up inventories of our resources, teach us to exploit them rationally and give us some mechanism so we can solve our balance of payments problems.' At the same time, developing nations without natural energy resources - the majority of the 69 ACP countries - are concerned that in a capricious world oil market they may be hamstrung by their dependence on hydrocarbons. Their anxiety is well-founded: according to the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa spends about one-third of its hard currency earnings on petroleum. Energy analysts say the concern should not be one-sided. The buzz-word of the Luanda conference - as at previous EC-ACP gatherings - was 'interdependence'. The developed north will simply store up trouble for itself for the future if it neglects the energy needs and concerns of the developing south, which - together with other non-OECD economies - is exercising an increasing influence over international energy policy. Mr Quincey Lumsden, a director of the International Energy Agency, warned delegates that in 10 years' time, important oil crisis management decisions could be taken beyond the industrialised nations' reach - not in Paris, where the IEA has it headquarters, but in Beijing, Brasilia or New Delhi. The EC's ability to meet the concerns of ACP countries with direct action is limited by its existing political and financial commitments. ACP oil and gas producers, for example, have long insisted that hydrocarbons should be eligible for special loans and export earnings stabilisation funds from the EC. Such assistance is at present provided for most commodities under the Ecu12bn (Pounds 8.4bn) Fourth Lome Convention - the EC-ACP trade and aid agreement - but oil and gas are excluded. Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, told the Luanda conference that such wishes - reiterated by Angola's Mr Van Dunen and by Mr Ralph Maraj, foreign minister of Trinidad and Tobago (the only non-African ACP oil producer) - 'did not fall on deaf ears'. But realistically, the European Commission is unlikely to press for changes in the Lome terms to benefit a dozen developing nations that already have greater natural advantages than other ACP members. However, senior commission officials believe existing community initiatives  -applied both to EC members and to central and east European countries - do provide examples of ways in which the framework for energy development in ACP countries could be improved. Recent draft EC legislation to harmonise criteria for granting oil and gas exploration licences contains principles that could be applied to ACP countries. That would ensure equitable conditions for potential international investors, some of which complained at the conference that the contract terms being imposed by developing oil producers were too tough. The European energy charter - designed to help the former Soviet Union and eastern European states exploit their natural resources - could be extended or adapted to ACP countries. As the continued desire to invest in Angolan oil-fields during the civil war indicated, international companies will continue to drill for oil under the most difficult political circumstances. But an African energy charter would provide a level of security for international investors - and reciprocal guarantees for ACP and exploration companies - which would underpin economic development of the developing countries. An ACP-EC working group is now likely to be set up to continue discussion of the issues raised by the Luanda conference. Improved training is one fundamental problem that needs to be tackled, particularly in countries, like Angola, that have suffered severe disruption of regular education. As one aide to the Angolan energy minister put it during the conference, for African oil producers 'money is no problem - but there is a whole generation which has had little education or training'. Similarly, ACP countries are held back by inefficiency in the refining and distribution sectors. That pushes up costs in states that do not produce their own oil, and occasionally forces African exporters of crude to import petroleum products. Theoretical solutions do not always work in such cases: ACP delegates pointed out that the break-up of downstream state monopolies in procurement, refining and distribution - one approach advocated by Mr Miguel Schloss of the World Bank - is not on its own enough to encourage investment in decaying infrastructure. Perhaps the biggest issue the working group will have to tackle is the question of protecting the environment, which commission officials insisted should be a priority for the developing countries as it is now for most industrialised nations. ACP representatives were surprisingly reticent about the impact an EC energy tax might have on their future economic development. But there seems little doubt that if the commission's plans announced this month get the backing of EC members the poorer oil-hungry nations will break their silence.

The price was Dollars 75m (Pounds 50.6m). Enterprise acquired the interest in 1986 when it bought ICI's exploration and producing interests. Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive, said the sale formed part of the company's continuing programme of portfolio management. Proceeds would be redeployed in the business. Enterprise has been steadily unwinding its older North Sea assets. Last year it sold its interests in the mature Hutton and North West Hutton fields. As a result of these sales, it has relinquished its remaining interest in the Sullum Voe oil terminal and the Brent and Ninian pipeline systems which feed it. Its strategy is to use the proceeds of sales to fund acquisitions which will enhance the quality of its oil portfolio. Clyde Petroleum announced yesterday that it had sold its 1 per cent interest in the Forties field to BP for about Pounds 5m. Hamilton Oil has been given approval by the Department of Energy to develop the Lennox oil and gas field in block 110/15 in Liverpool Bay.

'Shell is joining Saga in an agreement of intentions previously entered between Saga and the Russian enterprises Severgasprom, Arkhangekskgeologia and Ukhtaneftegasgeologia regarding the creation of a joint venture,' Saga Petroleum explained. The joint venture being negotiated is a proposed 50:50 Russian and foreign co-operation, and aims to develop discovered oil and gas fields. Severgasprom, the leading Russian partner in the pact, has applied for exploitation licences on behalf of the group. The licences comprise the oil fields Mid and North-Kharyaga and five gas and gas condensate fields. Saga said the joint venture also aimed to apply for exploration and production licences for an area near the discovered fields. One appraisal well is planned this year on the Mid-Kharyaga field which may be cored, logged and tested by western contractors financed by Saga and Shell. For two years Saga and its Russian partners have been negotiating a joint venture agreement and undertaken joint petroleum reserves studies, technical development scenarios and economic feasibility studies, but Saga said further appraisal activities, studies and commercial negotiations were required before the commercial viability of the fields could be declared.

Moscow says the study will lead to a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) exploration and development project. Marathon Oil and McDermott International of the US and Japan's Mitsui and Co defeated four other teams, one of which included Exxon. The deal appears to be the most ambitious of its kind to date. The Russian government hopes to conclude several more agreements with western oil companies to help revive flagging domestic production. The deal, due to be concluded on March 31, is for a feasibility study into the development of reserves estimated at 730m barrels of oil and more than 400bn cubic metres of gas. Such resources are of immediate interest to Japan, which lies just south of Sakhalin. A Mitsui official said the consortium had made 'small' changes to its original proposals, after Russia set new conditions, some related to the needs of local people. A Russian industry expert said that local authorities in Sakhalin had pressed for the tender to be restarted from scratch. The choice of the US-Japanese consortium signified a victory for central authorities in Moscow. Although the agreement is formally for a feasibility study, the oil companies are likely to have reached an understanding with Russian authorities on profit-sharing. Moscow is also due soon to produce legislation on mineral rights to clarify the position of foreign investors. The feasibility study should take about 18 months.

The company has just acquired a 54 per cent stake in the Recetor acreage, in Colombia's eastern Andes, from Maxus, a US company that discovered gas and gas condensate when it drilled a well there late last year. The gas find suggests the presence of oil and, according to estimates in Colombia, the Volcanero well may contain up to 500m barrels of oil. BP carried out the initial seismic survey of the acreage for Maxus and started with a 10 per cent stake. The Recetor field lies just south of Piedemonte, a 5,000 sq km block owned by BP. The Volcanero find is believed to extend into Piedemonte, although limited early drilling elsewhere in the block has as yet found nothing. In the second of the two discoveries, BP's explorations between the Orkney and Shetland islands have produced a second find which could equal the 250m to 500m barrels estimated for its first discovery last March. The two wells are in blocks acquired with the purchase of Britoil in 1988. The area has been described by the government as a possible 'new province' of the North Sea. BP has an 80 per cent share in the first discovery and Shell 20 per cent, while the two groups have 50 per cent each of the latest find. The two also have 50 per cent each of five blocks awarded by the government last summer to encourage exploration in the area.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

0,FT932-8288 ,"FT932-8288 _AN-DESCQAHHFT 930519   FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (12): Long catalogue of woes - Environmental laws are to be strengthened      By KEN WARN   CHILE'S constitution enshrines the right to live in an environment 'free from pollution.' That is probably little consolation to Santiago's 4.5m citizens, who are forced, particularly in the winter months, to live under a pall of choking fumes. In spite of the fine words of the constitution, Chile suffers from an array of intractable environmental problems resulting from its natural-resource intensive economy, inadequate government controls and sprawling urbanisation. Only now is the yawning gap between the constitution and everyday reality being addressed. In the autumn of 1992, the government of President Patricio Aylwin submitted a package of legislation to Congress to strengthen and extend the country's patchwork of environmental laws and decrees. Companies would for the first time be required to undertake environmental impact studies of new projects, and a start would be made on the formulation of environmental standards. The absence of a viable regulatory framework leaves complainants against polluters little option but to embark on often lengthy court actions. The battle against pollution is still in its early stages. 'The country as a whole has not confronted the environment as an issue,' says Mr Juan Escudero, head of the Santiago anti-pollution commission. 'Only in the past five or six years has there been any kind of awakening to environmental problems.' The commission's efforts to tackle the specific problems of Santiago are similarly at an early stage. Air pollution has been measured and the worst sources of emissions identified, according to Mr Escudero. But the hard part  -implementing a pollution-control plan for metropolitan Santiago - is only just beginning. Chile's capital is not helped by its geography and climate. Santiago is at 33 degrees south and is ringed by mountains up to 3,200 metres high. From April to August (autumn and winter) thermal inversions trap the city's pollutants, mainly particulates and carbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts. Under the plentiful summer sunlight, the main problem is photochemical smog. Buses, particularly old and badly maintained ones, are the main culprits, and some successes have already been scored against Santiago's vocal and powerful bus operators. The government has sought to reduce the number of buses, which account for over half of all journeys undertaken in Santiago, and cut duplication by putting some routes out to tender. There are now formal contracts between operators and the ministry of transport in what was formerly a completely unregulated system. Some 4,000 old buses have been taken out of service in the past three years, and the total bus fleet has been reduced from 13,000 to under 11,000 vehicles - 'still too many,' sighs Mr Escudero. Private vehicles face controls, too. Car use is restricted for much of the year in central Santiago on a rotating basis, and since September 1992 all new private vehicles have had to be fitted with catalytic converters. The catalogue of Santiago's environmental woes goes on. The city produces 10 cubic metres of untreated waste water every second. While the city is finishing its first water-treatment plant, at a cost of Dollars 12m, it will take hundreds of millions of dollars and at least a decade to create an effective system for the city as a whole. How many plants to build - and where to build them - is still being studied. Outside the capital, the country's natural resource based industries have only recently begun to clean up their act. The state-owned copper corporation Codelco, for example, is committed to spending between 15 and 20 per cent of its investment budget - about Dollars 90m a year - on environmental controls. But the pace of the industrial clean-up and the government's gradualist approach to environmental regulation, aimed at minimising the impact on growth, is rejected by an increasingly vocal lobby. 'Chile's macro-economic indicators are quite spectacular, but also dangerous,' says environmental campaigner Mr Manfred Max-Neef. 'Another eight years of the same will leave the country devastated,' he says. Mr Max-Neef is running for president in December's elections as an independent candidate backed by a 'rainbow coalition', including environmentalist and women's groups, and trade unions. He does not seriously expect to win the presidency but aims to push environmental issues up the political agenda. He lambasts the government for allowing the 'devastation' of Chile's natural resources. At the southern port of Puerto Montt, 'there are mountains of wood chips waiting to be sent to Japan to be made into toilet paper. I don't think that's a very noble destiny for our native forests,' he says. Chile's nascent environmental activists have already notched up some successes, including a legal campaign by olive growers in the Huasco Valley for more environmental controls at an iron pellet plant, which they claim blighted their crops. As if its internally generated environmental difficulties were not enough, Chile faces an as-yet unquantified threat in the form of ozone depletion. Every spring, Antarctica loses much of its ozone cover, as a result of photochemical reaction with the greenhouse gases produced by the industrialised world, exposing neighbouring countries to increasing levels of cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. The ozone hole is getting bigger, appearing earlier and lasting longer every year. The implications for southern Chile could be enormous. Whereas the government has at least started to take stock and act on Chile's more conventional environmental dilemmas, understanding of the ozone problem is only in the earliest stages.

0,FT924-9345 ,"FT924-9345 _AN-CKFB8AHDFT 921106   FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (7): Across the water / Review of the energy sector      By DONAL BUCKLEY   IN CONTRAST to the Irish manufacturers which are trying desperately to distance themselves from the effects of the downturn in the UK currency, the Irish energy sector is looking increasingly to the UK for future development. The Irish gas board, BGE, is well advanced in its plans for the construction of a IPounds 280m gas interconnector to Scotland in order to tap into North Sea gas. A study on the feasibility of a UK electricity interconnector is also under way. Flogas, the only publicly quoted LPG distributor, is developing its UK market presence by diversifying into the sale of British natural gas in England, and the hopes of some of Ireland's leading oil exploration companies are increasingly dependent on North Sea prospects. The currency advantage of the stronger Irish pound makes buying UK energy for the Irish market more attractive. Conversely, competition from cheaper priced sterling products has further intensified the pressure on the Irish government from industrialists requiring reduced energy costs to improve competitiveness. Even before the rise of the Irish pound against sterling, the Culliton Review Group, a government-appointed commission on employment creation and industrial competitiveness, pointed out that the Irish government-owned electricity supply board, EBB, could reduce the cost of electricity by using imported fuels instead of peat. However, such a decision would spell disaster for Bord na Mona, the state-owned peat harvesting company which generates 55 per cent of its revenue from its sales to the EBB. Peat also provides an important source of employment in the Irish midlands, where the Taoiseach's constituency, Mr Albert Reynolds's, is based. Culliton says: 'The financial and social consequences of a reduced price for milled peat should be faced by the government directly and not hidden in a cross subsidy between the two state sponsored bodies.' But since implementation of the Culliton proposal would cause social and political consequences equivalent to a pit closure for a British Labour government, the Irish coalition government is unlikely to risk such a move. Similarly, the government seems reluctant to implement another Culliton proposal: that BGE charge a more commercial price for the natural gas it sells to Irish Fertiliser Industries as a feedstock for manufacturing nitrogen fertiliser. IFI (and its predecessor, NET) has been receiving this gas at a discount, paying as little as one fifth of the price paid by commercial customers. A more likely victim of the drive for competitiveness could be the state-owned Irish Refining Company. whose sales rely mainly on the government requirement that Irish oil distributors source one third of their supplies from the refinery. The result is an extra imposition on petrol prices for consumers. Here the government has at least taken the step of trying to find a purchaser or partner to take over the operation and invest in upgrading. So far its efforts have proved fruitless. The government appears to be holding out in the hope that an important oil discovery in the Celtic Sea - on the shore of which the refinery is located  -could help to justify the investment. The most recent well to be drilled last month discovered oil, which flowed at 100 barrels a day, approximately 30 miles south of the refinery. This news offers little encouragement for the refinery company, but adds to the tantalising results of exploration, which indicate that there is oil at a number of locations off the southern coast. (The structure is so complex that it requires innovative investment and production techniques to bring it ashore.) The government has recently begun to recognise that it too must take a more innovative approach to offshore exploration. As a result it has reduced corporation profits tax on oil discoveries to as low as 25 per cent - which compares favourably with tax rates for North Sea producers. It has also designed its terms to revive interest - which had been flagging, after the disappointing results of the 1970s. Mobil, the second largest US oil company, has committed itself to drilling programmes with a number of Irish companies, including Aran Energy and Bula. Pict, the UK exploration company, also joined in the search this summer. To encourage exploration in the frontier area off the north west Atlantic coast, Mr Bobby Molloy, the Irish minister for energy, is scheduled to announce special licensing terms which 'will reflect the particularly challenging nature of the acreage.' The challenge to which the minister refers includes the weather conditions; the minister describes the area as having one of the best wind regimes in Europe. But while the wind may cause difficulties for exploration, it can facilitate the generation of alternative energy. Last month saw the completion of Ireland's first wind farm on the north west coast with a capacity of 6.45 megawatts for the ESB controlled national grid. But even the recent 30 per cent increase in the price, to 3.6p per unit for independent supplies, is unlikely to lead to this sector catering for the increased electricity demand expected before the end of the century. Instead, the ESB has developed proposals for another gas powered station in Dublin. Since nuclear fuel has also proved unpopular, it seems that the only other alternative would be the interconnector which it is exploring with the UK National Grid Company. Both partners hope that the EC could be persuaded to help finance the project (the gas interconnector is receiving IPounds 80m.). Routed through Northern Ireland and Wales, it would link both parts of the island to the European free trade electricity network. Such a link would also lay the groundwork for outside involvement in generating electricity for the Irish market. With serious concern that gas sales are unlikely to provide a return from the interconnector soon enough, BGE may encourage British Gas to avail itself of the interconnector in order to introduce natural gas to the Belfast markets, and to power an electricity station in Northern Ireland. The next step could see British participation in the distribution of natural gas in the Republic, just as Flogas is already doing in the UK.  The Financial Times   London Page 35  "

At the present rate of production the country's reserves will last well into the next century. The most recent discovery was in the Tiputini field in the easternmost region of Ecuador. The exploratory well Pishtingo 1 alone indicated about 237m barrels, almost equal to the estimated reserves for the Tiputini and nearby Tanacocha field together. Mr Ricardo Estrada, the executive director of Petroecuador, the state-owned oil company, said it was now obvious that 'the prospects of further incrementing the petroleum reserves of the country are excellent'. In order to tap other potential reserves in the area, Petroecuador will hold another round of bidding for exploration in the near future. Before exploiting the new reserves, five more exploratory wells are planned for the area. Furthermore, 190 km of road and 300 km of pipeline need to be constructed north-west to Lago Agrio, from where the trans-Ecudadorian pipeline will transport the oil across the Andes to the Pacific ports. Petroecuador calculates that the project requires an investment of USDollars 280m over six years. The field's production time is estimated 'DISTEyears, with a maximum daily output of 45,000 barrels a day. In order to transport the heavy crude from Tiputini, it needs to be mixed with a lighter crude from the Panacocha field. Until a more efficient and economic form of transport is available Petroecuador is expected to push the development of the field while the lighter crude is still available to mix with its oil.

The delegation will be composed of officials from state-run  enterprises such as Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), Taiwan Power  Company [Taipower], Taiwan Sugar Corp. [Taisugar], Taiwan  Fertilizer Co. Ltd., China Steel Corp., BES Engineering Corp.,  and Taiwan Salt Works.    Ministry officials said the CPC will be looking at oil  exploration and oil refinery deals, and Taipower is interested  in investing in both hydro and thermal power generation projects.    In addition, CPC officials will meet with their Indonesian  counterparts on the purchase of low-sulphur crude oil and  liquefied natural gas, while Taipower will offer to help train  Indonesian electricity engineers and managers.    Taisugar, Taiwan Salt, Taiwan Fertilizer, and China Steel  are  looking forward to providing Indonesia with expertise in  sugar-cane planting, salt panning, fertilizer manufacturing, and  steel making, respectively, the officials pointed out.    Moreover, they noted, BES is considering assisting Indonesia  in the planning and construction of industrial parks and  residential districts.    The government's southern strategy has been fueled by  Premier  Lien Chan's vacation trip to Malaysia and Singapore at the  beginning of the year and President Li Teng-hui's unofficial  visit to the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand in February.    The strategy encourages Taiwan manufacturers to increase  investment in Vietnam and member countries of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations, which groups the Philippines,  Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Brunei.

BP Exploration declined to comment on its plans for Tex/Con. However, energy industry sources said the sale would be in keeping with BP's shift of emphasis in its exploration activities from the lower 48 US states to 'frontier' areas, such as Alaska and Central and South America. An analyst in London said Tex/Con is likely to fetch between Dollars 650m and Dollars 1bn. According to US reports, BP has appointed investment bank JP Morgan to handle the sale. Prospective buyers will soon be invited to inspect details of Tex/Con's financial and operating condition in New York and Houston. Tex/Con's business, which includes exploration, production and pipelines, is centred in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It has interests in 3,000 wells and operates 1,500 miles of gas-gathering pipelines. Tex/Con produces about 11,800 barrels of oil and 121m cu ft of gas a day. BP does not disclose revenue or profit figures for Tex/Con. But low natural gas prices, an inability to fully replace reserves, and falling oil production appear to have contributed to BP's disillusion with Tex/Con, which was set up as an autonomous, entrepreneurial venture. Staff has been sharply cut back as part of an effort to reduce overheads. The company's problems emerged last week when BP announced Tex/Con's chief executive Mr Bill Johnson was taking early retirement. Mr Johnson has been replaced by Mr Bill Sears, formerly vice-president for offshore exploration.  The Financial Times   London Page 21  "

0,FT941-7282 ,"FT941-7282 _AN-EBYDJAD9FT 940225   FT  25 FEB 94 / No longer just a dreamtime: Nikki Tait examines the impact of Australia's new legislation on relations between Aboriginal peoples and industry      By NIKKI TAIT   Mr Malcolm Douglas wants to build a crocodile farm in Broome, 2,000km north of Perth. He already operates a crocodile park in the remote coastal town, but said it had become overcrowded to the point where the crocodiles were maiming each other. The business as it stands is too small to be viable. If the new project were to go ahead, about 20 jobs, in an area with limited employment prospects, could be created. The problem for Mr Douglas is that the local Yawuru Aboriginal people believe the proposed 21-hectare plot lies on land of spiritual significance, and that the development could interfere with their ceremonial rites. So under legislation that came into force on January 1, they have lodged a claim with Australia's Native Title Tribunal, a new federal organisation to arbitrate on indigenous peoples' land rights. It is one of the first demands to be submitted to the tribunal. The process will be complex. First, the veracity of the tribe's anthropological history must be established. Next, the claim must be registered and advertised in local papers. Finally, hearings to determine the claim's merits may take place. Meanwhile, Mr Robert Tickner, federal minister for Aboriginal affairs, has ordered a 30-day halt to work on the site. 'At last it has been recognised that our cultural heritage is threatened,' said Mr Francis Djaigween, a Yawuru elder. Elsewhere, other cases are beginning to be brought under Australia's native title legislation, which was passed by parliament just before Christmas. The first claim - from the Wiradjuri people over land in New South Wales - passed the anthropological test yesterday. Today debate over the degree to which the act impinges on state rights is expected to dominate a meeting in Hobart, Tasmania, between the prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, and Australia's state premiers. The law stems from a 1992 High Court ruling that said, for the first time, native title rights could exist in Australia if the indigenous inhabitants had maintained a 'close and continuing' association with a piece of land. With that single ruling, the doctrine of terra nullius - the notion that Australia was unoccupied prior to European settlement  - was overturned. Until then, Australia had been the only former British colony not to recognise land ownership by the indigenous peoples - lagging Canada by 200 years and New Zealand by a century and a half. The High Court ruling, however, was a mixed blessing for Australia's 265,000 Aborigines, who account for 1.6 per cent of the population. While acknowledging native title rights, the court also declared that existing leasehold or freehold titles, which had been granted lawfully, should not be disturbed. Faced with squaring these two seemingly conflicting requirements, the government drew up the Native Title Bill. This set out a system for 'validating' most existing land titles and formally cancelling competing native title rights. Compensation for genuine Aboriginal claims would be paid by either the state or federal government. The law also made an exception of mining leases. For these, it said, native titles could coexist with an existing lease and 'revive' when that lease expired. When the Native Title Act was passed on December 21, Mr Keating said it offered 'a modicum of justice to indigenous Australians'. He added: 'Today, we move closer to a united Australia which respects this land of ours.' But as the legislation comes into operation and claims, such as that from the Yawuru people, start to arrive at the tribunal, the effects are proving more complicated. The legislation was a political compromise between conflicting interest groups and, like most compromise deals, it extracted a price all round. Those affected fall into four broad groups. The first comprises the Aborigines and the indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait islands. Widely dispersed across Australia's vast land mass, they entered the native title debate with disparate views. For some, the act is a failure because it eliminates native title rights on large tranches of Australia which had been theirs. Others have been more pragmatic, arguing that any chance to claw back some rights should be seized. 'The land was ours and taken away from us,' said Mr Peter Costello, a Cape York elder, during the negotiations in Canberra. 'The European people are going to lead this country, and I won't be coming here again. But we never said that we were going to take everything . . . We just want some vacant crown land.' This may be a realistic assessment of what Aborigines can hope to achieve. Over the past 200 years, many have moved - or been moved - off their forebears' land, so the 'close and continuing' land association requirement will not be readily met. More than a quarter of the Aboriginal population lives in Australia's eight state/territory capitals. Using such residence patterns, Aboriginal leaders estimate that only about 10 per cent of their peoples stand a realistic chance of benefiting directly from the native title legislation. Because land association is most likely to have been broken when freehold or leasehold title has been granted to white settlers, the best chances of a successful claim will be against unused land owned by the nation. Most of this lies in west Australia. Here a bruising battle between the state and federal governments is under way, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the short-term progress of any claims. While Mr Keating's Labor government was battling to get its land rights legislation passed in Canberra, the conservative Western Australian government enacted different native title legislation in Perth. That removed native title rights altogether, replacing them with much weaker 'rights to traditional usage' of the land (for ceremonial purposes, for instance). The Western Australia legislation is already under assault. Aboriginal groups have mounted a legal challenge, claiming that it breaches federal racial discrimination legislation. Mr Keating has suggested that only those states and territories that support the federal act will get federal help with compensation payments. Mr Richard Court, premier of Western Australia, said that amounted to 'blackmail'. He has some backing from other states and territories, which have yet to introduce their own legislation on the subject. Even if the federal regime eventually prevails - as seems likely - short-term confusion is inevitable, further complicating procedures for processing Aboriginal claims. No sooner had Mr Tickner issued his order over Broome's proposed crocodile farm, for example, than the Western Australian authorities announced they would challenge it. As for the 90 per cent of Aborigines who may gain little directly from the legislation, the Native Title Act promises a new land fund to assist Aboriginal land purchases and management 'in a way that provides economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits'. The fund will form part of a broader 'social justice' package designed to address the disadvantages faced by the Aboriginal population. For many Aborigines, this is every bit as important as the act itself. But they will have to wait for the details: Canberra has yet to set a budget for the fund and has said the package would not be finalised until 1995. The second group affected by the legislation is the mining industry, which believes it has lost heavily under the new law. It complains that the costs of doing business in Australia will go up, forcing many companies to look abroad for new projects. To some extent, however, the complaints of the mining industry are exaggerated. Existing leases are 'validated' by the new act, and if a lease granted before 1994 contained a specific right to renew, that too is enforceable. But future exploration, say the mining companies, is another matter. The Australian Mining Industry Council estimated that the new tribunal might delay the development of a project by up to two years, and said its members were already reassessing their exploration plans. 'Title problems are getting worse,' said Mr Hugh Morgan, head of Western Mining and one of the Native Title Act's most outspoken critics. 'Most exploration programmes are studying their navels at present for 1994-95. They (the implications of the Act) are only slowly permeating down.' The AMIC points to a report by the Centre of International Economics on the impact of an Aboriginal land rights law that operated in the Northern Territory since 1976, and the degree to which it has restricted mining activity. The report estimates that the law has cost the Northern Territory about ADollars 2.39bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in income over the period. Defenders of the federal act, however, point out that Northern Territory law differs significantly from the new legislation - giving Aborigines a right of veto over mining exploration, for example. At the same time, they say, the CIE study used figures based on numbers of exploration licences. That gives a distorted picture, because exploration on Aboriginal land tends be large scale. Four-fifths of the minerals produced in the Northern Territory come from Aboriginal land, according to the Central Land Council, which represents local Aboriginal landholders and claimants. Nevertheless, the need to resolve native title issues will inevitably add something to a mining company's costs. How much, and the extent to which it makes offshore alternatives more attractive, will depend on a variety of factors - ranging from the efficiency of the Native Title Tribunal and the attitude of individual Aboriginal groups to external factors such as Australia's exchange rate. The mining industry admits that it will take time for the impact of the new law to be felt. 'In fact, the exploration dollar spent over the next couple of years will probably go up,' said Mr Geoffrey Ewing, assistant director of the AMIC, pointing to the long-term nature of the mining business. But eventually, he warned, 'it's just one of those things which will tip the balance for some companies'. Other land-based industries, ranging from Australia's farming community to the large tourism sector, are the third group affected by the act. In general, thanks to deft lobbying by the National Farmers Federation, these are relatively well protected under the legislation because land titles will be validated. Any new businesses, however, and those looking to expand or relocate will in future have to bear in mind the possibility of an Aboriginal challenge - as the Malcolm Douglas case demonstrates. The fourth principal effect of the new legislation is on Australian identity. Most sea-hugging, city-dwelling Australians learn about the problems of the Aboriginal population second-hand, but their reaction to the legislation nonetheless has been mostly favourable. As Mr Keating said, no one's home would be seized, taxes had not risen, jobs were not affected. For little obvious cost, Australians had gained a sense of having righted old wrongs. Whether this mood would persist if an economic price became apparent is more debatable. There have been suggestions that the costs of the native title legislation, plus the accompanying Aboriginal social justice package, could lead to a tax rise at a later date. But even if federal finances taxes do increase, Australia's long-term unemployment problem is more likely to be blamed than the Aborigines. All along, realpolitik has been at the centre of the Australian native title debate. The country has tried to find a method of melding its original culture, with its spiritual values and its belief that land is integral to a way of life, with a more commercial, western approach. While the solution may lack elegance, Australia is at least offering something to its indigenous peoples - albeit 200 years too late. As one Perth-based judge, commenting on the Yawuru case, remarked: 'On one view, this is a classic clash between God and mammon. The economic interests of a commercial enterprise are set against the spiritual and cultural life of a section of the community. 'Of course,' he continued, 'it is not that simple. Both sets of interests are entirely legitimate.'   Countries:-  AUZ  Australia.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.     P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

The company said its results reflected the domestic economic recovery as well as an improvement in its chemical division, an increased contribution from its gas division and better productivity. It added that the improvement in margins accelerated in the third quarter. It said the strong performance in the chemical and gas units compensated for the downturn in the oil business. Income from chemicals was up from Pta3.7bn to Pta10.7bn and by 23.1 per cent to Pta33bn in the gas division. Profits in Repsol refining and oil marketing division, however, fell by 3 per cent to Pta72bn and dropped by 29 per cent to Pta11.7bn in the exploration and production division. Repsol lifted its gas profile earlier this year when Gas Natural, the dominant domestic gas distributor which is 45 per cent owned by Repsol, acquired Enagas, the big state-owned importer of natural gas. Gas Natural has, as result, become the third biggest gas company in Europe and the virtual monopoly gas importer and distributor in the fast growing domestic market. Government plans to reduce its 41 per cent stake in Repsol by as much as half towards the end of this year through a global offering were delayed because of the instability of the markets. The offering, however, remains first on the list of the Spanish state disposals planned for next year.   Companies:-  Repsol.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

The government has rejected an application by the Karinji aboriginal tribe to block the project under the federal Aboriginal Heritage Protection Act. Mr Robert Tickner, the federal minister for aboriginal affairs, said he was not satisfied that the mining project was a serious threat to aboriginal heritage, as required by the Act. Hamersley Iron will now have to pass the state environmental regulations of Western Australia before the project can finally proceed. A company official yesterday said the decision was due in 20 weeks and that he was optimistic that the project would get the state government's approval. Mr Tickner's decision is the latest in a series of recent moves that seem to indicate the government's desire to offset the negative effects of its blocking of the Coronation Hill gold and platinum mine in June last year. Late last year Mr Tickner declined to use the Aboriginal Heritage Act to block Dominion Mining's ADollars 350m nickel project at Yakabindie, also in Western Australia. However, the project is still delayed by an appeal against the state government's approval lodged by aboriginal groups with the Western Australian Supreme Court. The Coronation Hill ban had reduced industry confidence in Australian mining investments, with local companies threatening to shift substantial exploration budgets overseas. Last week, the Coronation Hill joint venturers, led by New Crest Mining, filed a High Court action challenging the validity of the government plan.  The Financial Times   London Page 36  "

COAST      By DOUGLAS JEHL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      A National Academy of Sciences panel has concluded that the Interior Department  lacks sufficient information to proceed with projected oil drilling leases in  two sites off the California coast, according to a report to be made public  today.    Its finding that knowledge about the consequences of oil exploration there is  ""inadequate and unreliable"" marks a major blow to Administration hopes to set  policy for the controversial sites by the end of the year.    The report by the prestigious National Research Council could result in further  postponements of leasing steps already delayed by a recent congressional  moratorium barring lease sales until next Oct. 1.    The report, commissioned by the White House, found that the government had not  gathered enough information about either Southern California oceanography or  the effects of drilling on the region's social and economic life to go forward  with a leasing decision.    It similarly faulted the Interior Department for failing to take into account  the socioeconomic consequences of an oil lease off Northern California.    The finding comes just two months before a Cabinet-level task force is due to  recommend to President Bush whether drilling in the two California sites and in  a separate Florida tract should proceed.    The report, made available by an Administration source, is to be presented to  the panel at a public meeting today. Interior Department officials expressed  disappointment with its findings. They acknowledged that it could weaken the  impact of the task force report severely. The report had been expected to  recommend drilling in at least some sites.    In the aftermath of the research council criticisms, the scheduled  Administration policy recommendation almost certainly will have to be  accompanied by the caveat that more research is needed, representatives from  both sides of the issue agreed.    The need for further study could delay leasing steps beyond the dates set by  the moratorium, which prohibits even prelease activity in Southern California's  Lease Sale 95 until June 1. No actual lease sale in that tract or Northern  California's Lease Sale 91 tract could take place until at least next Oct. 1  under the congressionally imposed restriction.    Robert Kallman, executive director of the task force, said through a spokesman  that the findings of the research council will be ""incorporated in our final  report to the President."" He did not elaborate.    Opponents of offshore drilling hailed the report as a bold action that raises  questions not only about the three lease sales in question, but about the  entire process that sets aside parts of the nation's outer continental shelf  for oil exploration.    ""It's a very damning report,"" said Andy Palmer, a spokesman for the American  Oceans Campaign. ""I think it calls into question the whole viability of the  offshore leasing program.""

COAST      By DOUGLAS JEHL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      A National Academy of Sciences panel has concluded that the Interior Department  lacks sufficient information to proceed with projected oil drilling leases in  two sites off the California coast, according to a report to be made public  today.    Its finding that knowledge about the consequences of oil exploration there is  ""inadequate and unreliable"" marks a major blow to Administration hopes to set  policy for the controversial sites by the end of the year.    The report by the prestigious National Research Council could result in further  postponements of leasing steps already delayed by a recent congressional  moratorium barring lease sales until next Oct. 1.    The report, commissioned by the White House, found that the government had not  gathered enough information about either Southern California oceanography or  the effects of drilling on the region's social and economic life to go forward  with a leasing decision.    It similarly faulted the Interior Department for failing to take into account  the socioeconomic consequences of an oil lease off Northern California.    The finding comes just two months before a Cabinet-level task force is due to  recommend to President Bush whether drilling in the two California sites and in  a separate Florida tract should proceed.    The report, made available by an Administration source, is to be presented to  the panel at a public meeting today. Interior Department officials expressed  disappointment with its findings. They acknowledged that it could weaken the  impact of the task force report severely. The report had been expected to  recommend drilling in at least some sites.    In the aftermath of the research council criticisms, the scheduled  Administration policy recommendation almost certainly will have to be  accompanied by the caveat that more research is needed, representatives from  both sides of the issue agreed.    The need for further study could delay leasing steps beyond the dates set by  the moratorium, which prohibits even prelease activity in Southern California's  Lease Sale 95 until June 1. No actual lease sale in that tract or Northern  California's Lease Sale 91 tract could take place until at least next Oct. 1  under the congressionally imposed restriction.    Robert Kallman, executive director of the task force, said through a spokesman  that the findings of the research council will be ""incorporated in our final  report to the President."" He did not elaborate.    Opponents of offshore drilling hailed the report as a bold action that raises  questions not only about the three lease sales in question, but about the  entire process that sets aside parts of the nation's outer continental shelf  for oil exploration.    ""It's a very damning report,"" said Andy Palmer, a spokesman for the American  Oceans Campaign. ""I think it calls into question the whole viability of the  offshore leasing program.""

When operational, in about a year's time, the dredge mining and mineral separation operation at Beenup will generate about 600,000 tonnes of ilmenite and zircon a year. BHP added that it had also negotiated a smelter joint venture with the Tinfos group in Norway to process the ilmenite from the mine into high-quality titanium pigment feedstock. This will be used in the Tinfos Titan  Iron smelter at Norway's Tyssedal. Sale contracts covering the bulk of the ilmenite and slag output had been negotiated, BHP said. The Beenup deposits, discovered in 1988, contain an indicated resource of 83m tonnes of ilmenite. Of this, 33m tonnes is measured. BHP said there was also exploration potential, which could extend the resource. The company's shares closed 14 cents higher on the news, at ADollars 19.60. Robe River, the iron ore producer which is 53 per cent owned by Australia's North group, yesterday announced that it had negotiated a 7.3 per cent increase in the selling price of iron ore sinter fines for 1995-96 in its annual contract negotiations with the Japanese steel mills. It said it had also agreed a guaranteed minimum sales volume to Japan of 12.5m dry long tons for 1995/6, the same as in the current year. Much of the benefit of rises in the pricing current round could be eroded by the increased strength of the Australian dollar over the past year.

The Apollo 11 moon landing was a milestone in history, a feat of technological brilliance which promised to usher in a golden age of discovery and exploration. Yet now that much of the glamour of space exploration has faded, mention of the Apollo programme often prompts the question: 'what was it for?' Did the astronauts' landing in an airless, barren wilderness really advance the human race? How could any endeavour, however heroic, justify a total cost of some Dollars 24bn? In this age of financial realism, questions about the justification of the space programme are often answered in terms of its practical benefits. Without space exploration, 'the quality of life in the US today would be inconceivable', according to a recent US newspaper advertisement by Lockheed, the missiles and space company. 'Countless technologies - things we take for granted today, from automobile design to sewage treatment - owe their origins to space,' it says. The technical innovations that stemmed from the Apollo programme pushed forward the state of electronics, materials science, rocketry and computer software. The demands of the space venture to reduce the weight of equipment provided the catalyst for the development of the transistor and synthetic substances such as Kevlar and Fiberite, which are used for strong lightweight materials. Microwave ovens and weather forecasting satellites are also examples of sophisticated gadgetry which have emerged as a result of equipment developed for the space programme. The coating designed to reduce aerodynamic drag on the return capsule has been used on the bottom of racing yachts. Estee Lauder uses the digital image analyser software designed to map the depth of the moon's craters to measure skin wrinkles. But the potential value of such technological spin-offs played little part in persuading President John Kennedy to launch the Apollo mission, originally characterised as 'non-military, non-commercial (and) non-scientific' by his officials. The driving force behind Kennedy's decision was the desire to boost national pride and to compete with Russia's space programme in the face of cold war tensions. 'The primary reason to go the moon was the huge psychological benefit, in terms of national self-confidence,' says Lewis Branscomb of Harvard University, who presided over a committee that reported on the scientific, economic and psychological benefits of the Apollo programme in 1967. 'The main reason was international political competition,' says John Logsdon, a historian at George Washington University. 'Space was used as an arena for symbolic competition between communism and capitalism.' But once the initial awe at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's achievement wore off, the agency sought to sustain political support through stressing the economic spin-offs of the space launches. For instance, a study in 1975 by Chase Econometrics, a research group, found that a Dollars 1m RD expenditure each year for 10 years by Nasa would produce a 14-fold return for the wider economy. Mathematica, another US research group, also found a justification for Nasa's RD spending (in 1966, its peak year, the agency's spending accounted for 13 per cent of total US RD expenditure). It examined the agency's influence on speeding up the development of a number of technologies, including integrated circuits and a computer programme for analysing large structures. However, these findings have been criticised. Henry Hertzfeld, senior research associate at the Space Policy Institute in Washington, argues that the economic models 'were not sufficiently robust' to ensure the accuracy of the studies. Moreover, some observers doubt whether it is possible to isolate the influence of Nasa's RD spending. John Logsdon, for example, questions whether you can 'disentangle what superficially can be attributed to Apollo while there was a military developing advanced weaponry at the same time'. Ultimately, attempts to provide a cost-benefit analysis for space exploration founder on the complexity of quantifying the prestige, economic benefits and scientific advances arising from the Apollo missions. Instead, the outcome of the Apollo programme tends to be seen in a more emotional light. For many people, its most valuable legacy was the perspective on the earth provided by photographs from the moon: the image of a blue, fragile globe against an infinite black backdrop of space has assumed a symbolic importance. For others, the achievement of setting foot on the moon is viewed in spiritual terms, as a fulfilment of mankind's fundamental urge to seek new frontiers. Set against these grand, abstract ideals, attempts to apply economic analysis to the space programme risk being treated with scorn. 'The programme's not about little technical gains, developing Teflon and Velcro,' says Buzz Aldrin, one of the astronauts on Apollo 11. 'That's not why we went to the moon.'

0,FT932-5802 ,"FT932-5802 _AN-DFBBWACKFT 930602   FT  02 JUN 93 / Business and the Environment: All for the birds - Mining groups are anxious to protect wildlife      By KENNETH GOODING   Birds in Nevada now have new homes courtesy of Coeur d'Alene Mines. The company is attaching lightweight nesting boxes to its claim posts - the posts used to mark boundaries when mining companies stake their claims. The idea was developed by Rob Berry, senior landsman with Coeur d'Alene's exploration subsidiary. He noticed that the hollow plastic boundary posts often claimed more than mining land. Birds slipped into the open ends of the posts, sometimes to nest in them, and could not always escape. Rather than simply capping the posts, Berry developed the bird boxes, which are folded together from one piece of corrugated cardboard and attached with some simple hardware. The boxes are light enough for mineral exploration teams - who frequently hike many miles into remote areas - to carry several at a time. Berry called on experts at the Nevada Department of Wildlife to help design the nesting boxes, which were first tested last year at the group's Rochester mine in Nevada, the largest primary silver mine in the US. Now schools and Scout groups are also using them. Berry's boxes are suitable for small birds, bluebirds and wrens, but larger ones have been designed to accommodate kestrels, a species of owl and wood ducks. This, however, is not just a simple story about a nature-lover and a good idea. Dead birds are a very big issue at open-pit mines in the US. Mining companies are spending millions of dollars to make sure that they do not fall foul of legislation such as the US Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The act makes it illegal for any company or mine to kill migrating water fowl and every death has to be reported. The mining method that causes difficulties is called heap leaching. Ore is placed in a heap on an impermeable plastic pad and a weak cyanide solution is sprinkled over it. The solution collects at the bottom after percolating through the ore and dissolving much of the metal. This very low-cost process has enabled gold and silver to be won from rock containing very little of the precious metals - typically well under one ounce of gold in every tonne of ore - and it contributed to the tremendous upsurge of gold mining activity in Australia as well as North America in the 1980s. But tailings (waste), discharged into ponds after the gold has been separated from the solution, still contains cyanide which takes some time to lose its toxicity in the sunlight. Many of the US gold mines using heap leaching are in desert areas, and when birds in the desert see a patch of blue water there is little that can be done to stop them if they want to drop in for a drink. Most of the ponds are too large to be satisfactorily covered by netting  - heavy winter snows tend to tear it. But at the Rochester mine Coeur d'Alene tried this and various other methods to keep birds away from the cyanide solution. To scare the birds away, strips of polished aluminium were employed as well as propane cannons that exploded compressed gas with a loud bang at intervals. None of these strategies worked perfectly. Now the company is pioneering a 'closed loop' leaching system that does away with the open ponds. Instead, the cyanide solution circulates without seeing the light of day, and the 'pregnant' or metal-bearing solution is held in a closed tank before processing. Even the drip-irrigation facility is buried below the surface of the heap of ore on the leach pad. All this obviously helps to protect birds and other wildlife. But it has also reduced Rochester's costs by enabling leaching to go on year-round without the heap freezing and by reducing the amount of cyanide and water used. Coeur d'Alene is now leaching out the same amount of metal with 4,000 gallons of solution, against the previous 7,000 gallons. Dennis Wheeler, Coeur d'Alene's president, says the system helped to reduce the cash costs of production at Rochester from Dollars 3.76 a troy ounce in 1991 to Dollars 3.22 last year - or by more than 14 per cent. He says: 'Environmental protection is a key element in the mining industry and it will remain so.' So he encourages a positive approach throughout the company - an approach that led Berry to come forward with his bird house initiative and resulted in Coeur d'Alene winning several environmental awards in the past five years. This helps create a positive image for the mining industry in its battles with environmentalists. Wheeler suggests: 'Mining is a compatible use of the land and fully in keeping with the US tradition of multiple use of our lands.' He also insists that his shareholders recognise that money spent on environmental actions is well-spent. 'Our shareholders want to be part of an organisation that recognises a responsibility to the environment.'   Companies:-  Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The assets for sale include a 58 per cent interest in the Cadjebut mine. Western Metals is a privately-owned company, in which Ausgold holds a 13 per cent stake. Ausgold, which asked for its shares to be suspended yesterday, said it had made an offer to acquire the remaining 87 per cent of Western Metals. It said it planned to raise ADollars 30m (USDollars 21.7m), via an underwritten public share offering, to fund the Cadjebut deal and the development of other assets included in the BHP transaction. The interests involved include BHP's stake in the Cadjebut zinc/lead mine, which was developed in 1987 and has about another 18 months of life. Total production at Cadjebut last year was 102,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 29,000 tonnes of lead concentrate. Also included in the package are undeveloped ore bodies at Blendevale, Twelve Mile Bore and Kapok, and interests in a number of joint ventures in the region. Ausgold said it hoped 'to bring on stream the development of the next ore body, Twelve Mile Bore, before the existing reserves at Cadjebut are depleted'. BHP, which did not disclose the sale price, said the assets involved in the transaction no longer 'fitted our profile'.

The agreement, which hinged on convincing industrialised countries that commercial principles would be observed, is to be be adopted by the United Nations general assembly this month. It will allow the establishment of the International Seabed Authority, a new UN agency, which will administer the Law of the Sea Convention, and will create the Enterprise, the authority's commercial arm, which will oversee exploration and mining through joint ventures among private companies and states. The agreement will also create a tribunal that will adjudicate disputes over seabed mining among states and companies. The authority and the Enterprise will be located in Jamaica, while the tribunal will be in Hamburg, Germany. At the centre of the debates in the UN Law of the Sea Conference, which sought general acceptance of the convention are the trillions of dollars worth of polymetallic nodules that are lying on the international seabed, outside the 200-mile economic zone of any country. The nodules contain copper, nickel, manganese and cobalt, and varying quantities of other minerals. 'The intention was to find an orderly method of dealing with minerals located on the international seabed,' says Mr Kenneth Rattray, rapporteur general of the Law of the Sea Conference. 'Since these minerals are outside the economic zones of states, it was important to have an acceptance by all countries that the minerals did not belong to any one state or private company, but were the common heritage of all mankind. 'This is an attempt to avert anarchy in mining the international seabed and to permit orderly exploration and exploitation within a regulatory framework.' While developing countries have always been in favour of a convention to regulate the mining of the international seabed, the discussions were protracted because of reservations that industrialised states had about the commercial feasibility of the proposals, and about the sharing of costs and benefits. In its original form the Law of the Sea Convention was not clear on the role private business would play in seabed mining, and on how the technology would be obtained. Fundamental changes in the world economy, the move by governments away from central planning to market-based economies and the growing role for private business, all precluded the creation of an economic agency in which only governments would be involved. Under the draft of the convention, the Enterprise was to have been funded by the member states based on subscriptions and loans, with the first mining venture estimated to cost about USDollars 1bn. 'Philosophical and economic arguments indicated that this was not the most desired method, so it was agreed that the first operation of the enterprise will be done as a joint venture with the partners providing the investment, on the now accepted basis that the international seabed is the common heritage of mankind,' explains Mr Rattray. 'The enterprise is the only way for poorer countries to participate. Some developed states wanted the Enterprise to be abolished, but it was agreed that after its first venture the Enterprise will begin operating on a purely commercial basis.' There were also concerns among the industrialised states about the transfer of technology. Since private business, and not governments, own the technology, members of the UN were unable to get access to it. In the accord, it has been accepted that if the technology is not available on the market at commercially fair terms, governments would co-operate with the International Seabed Authority to make it available. 'This is intended to give the Enterprise a jump start,' says Mr Rattray. One of the more fundamental concerns about seabed mining, and in which both developed and developing countries had common concerns, was the effect the extraction of the polymetalic nodules and production of the minerals would have on land-based producers. While most states eschewed production ceilings, saying this method was an echo of central planning, land-based producers argued that there could be unfair economic practices in seabed mining, which could lead to a flooding of markets and depressed prices. There will be no production limits, but the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on unfair competition have been adopted in the Law of the Sea Convention. Production plans will include an estimate of the maximum quantity of minerals to be produced each year and there will be a compensation fund for land-based producers who are adversely affected by seabed mining. 'The original expectation when the conference began 11 years ago was that seabed mining would have started by 1998,' says Mr Rattray. 'This was not achieved because of real and philosophical changes in the world economy. With this agreement, commercial production from the seabed is now expected to begin in another 10 years.'

0,FT941-13429 ,"FT941-13429 _AN-EAZDAAA1FT 940126   FT  26 JAN 94 / British offer over Falklands oil      By DAVID OWEN and JOHN BARHAM      LONDON, BUENOS AIRES   The British government has indicated its readiness to allow Argentine companies to take part in the development of oilfields in the Falkland islands' territorial waters - provided they acknowledge that any oil extracted belongs to Britain. Government sources think it unlikely that Argentine interests will end up operating installations on the islands themselves, but believe Argentina's coast could be a logical site for support operations. Preliminary results from seismic surveys conducted last year around the Falklands suggested the possibility of finding oil across a zone 25 per cent larger than the North Sea. The disclosure of Britain's position follows a recent request from Buenos Aires for a meeting of senior foreign ministry officials to discuss joint development of oil resources. London has yet to agree to this meeting. Reaching an oil accord with the UK is Argentina's next important policy objective, but it is unlikely to accept terms that implicitly recognise Britain's sovereignty over the islands. Buenos Aires has used recent talks on fish to press for a role in the development of possible oil and gas reserves. British Gas said last year it had discussed joint offshore exploration close to the disputed waters with YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company. Some Falkland islanders are said to recognise that rapprochement with Argentina would probably be necessary if an oil industry were to be developed. Recent developments come against a background of steadily improving relations between the two former belligerents. A year ago, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, became the first UK cabinet minister to visit Argentina since the 1982 Falkland islands conflict. Since then both Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, and Mr Guido Di Tella, foreign minister, have visited Britain.   Countries:-  FKZ  Falkland Islands.

Based on 1992 sales data,     MI was the largest firm in the drilling fluid market, accounting for about 29 percent of sales, while Baroid Drilling, the second largest firm, accounted for about 22 percent. The merger of Dresser and Baroid would increase the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index by about 1200 points to a post-acquisition level of more than 2800 points. The merger of Dresser and Baroid will diminish competition in the drilling fluid market by enabling the remaining competitors more likely, more successfully, and more completely to engage in coordinated interaction that harms customers. The increase in concentration will result in higher prices for drilling fluids, which will increase the costs of oil and gas exploration and development in the United States.           Successful new entry into the United States drilling fluid market is difficult and time-consuming. Moreover, the expansion of fringe firms would be insufficient to counteract or deter a small but significant nontransitory price increase. To gain a significant market share, a firm must have an adequate, reliable, and independent source of barite and bentonite and a significant research and development capability.

They were launched, on Friday, aboard the US space shuttle Columbia. But in a mission loaded with 126 jellyfish, 11,200 baby sea urchin, 144 newt eggs, 180 toad eggs and 340 fish eggs, all eyes are going to be on just four Japanese Medaka fish. For these orange, one-inch-long, freshwater fish may be about to provide some answers, not just on sex in space, but on food in space too: solving two thorny issues for manned space exploration ahead of the construction in orbit of a Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.7bn) international space station. Due to begin in 1997, the space station should be completed by June 2002, if governments maintain their funding commitments. The Medaka fish experiment is aimed at developing fish breeding technology to provide the space station astronauts with a source of high-protein food. Scientists first tried to get rats to conceive in space, but they bounced off one another in a zero gravity environment. However, the tiny Japanese fish have a peculiar tolerance for weightlessness, unlike most fish, which swim in wild looping patterns when exposed to microgravity. They also have a short life cycle, of three months from one generation to the next, and once fertilised, Medaka eggs hatch within eight days. This will give the crew the opportunity to watch the fish mate and see their eggs hatch. But should the two amorous pairs of Medaka fish find it hard to have sex in space, the shuttle crew will experiment with the 340 artificially inseminated Medaka eggs also aboard the Columbia to study embryonic growth which, some scientists say, could help research into human embryos.

0,FT934-5287 ,"FT934-5287 _AN-DLACFAG8FT 931130   FT  30 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils under pressure      By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON   Another torrid session in the crude oil market, which saw Brent crude slip below the Dollars 14 a barrel mark at one point, triggered yet another bout of heavy selling pressure in an already bruised oil sector. Oil shares were the market's weakest performers last week after Opec surprised the market by holding its overall production level at 24.5m barrels a day. There had been hopes that Opec would cut output by around 2m barrels a day to try to stem the weakness in oil prices. And there were fears in international oil markets yesterday that Iraq may be permitted to resume oil sales in the middle of 1994, putting further pressure on Opec output quotas and prices. Yesterday, it was the oil majors rather than the exploration stocks that were roughly handled by the market, with US holders said to have continued to sell stocks such as BP and Shell aggressively amid talk of downgraded oil price and earnings forecasts. Shell dropped 12 1/2 to 665 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 6.5m, with the market additionally upset by reports that Gencor's purchase of Billiton, Shell's minerals and mining subsidiary, may have run into trouble. BP, which bore the brunt of some big downside pressure from the US late in the session, lost 7 more to 325 1/2 p in a large turnover of 13m. The exploration and production sub-sector outperformed the senior oil index, but nevertheless looked set to come under renewed fire. Lasmo, beset by worries about the dividend, eased further to 116p on 5.4m volume. Enterprise dipped 4 to 433p on 2.3m traded and Hardy fell 13 1/2 to 143 1/2 p. GEC, the flagship of the UK's electronics and heavy electrical industry, was one of the worst performers among the Footsie constituents as the market became increasingly nervous ahead of the group's interim figures tomorrow. Some fairly aggressive selling pressure saw the shares close 4 off at 333p on turnover of 8.1m, the fifth most heavily traded stock in the market. One close follower of the company described it as 'almost a utility but without the yield and dividend cover of most', and said the market had been slightly spooked by worries about difficult trading conditions which could provoke a series of profits downgrades of full year estimates. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo saw its shares rise 16 to 671p ahead of a key presentation on research and development this morning. There was also active business in traded options. Glaxo last held an RD presentation two years ago. Since then the group has launched three products, and now that they are in the market, pharmaceuticals experts will be looking for new developments to combat erosion of market share in Zantac, the anti-ulcer product which accounts for around 44 per cent of Glaxo's turnover. A return of speculation over the future of the stake held by Rank Organisation in Rank Xerox underpinned a rise in the shares in a firm leisure sector. Rumours of the sale by Rank to its venture partner Xerox have been in the market for some months, but were given fresh impetus at the weekend in an interview with the Rank chief executive. The sale of the Xerox stake could raise up to Pounds 1.5bn and effectively wipe out Rank's debts. However, while leisure specialists accept that the issue is on the agenda, most believe it is still some years off. Rank shares were up 7 at 883p, after touching 897p. Troubled theme park group Euro Disney rallied 10 to 360p on speculative buying. Stories swirling around the stock continue to suggest some imminent moves by the bank creditors to take a more forceful role in the company's financial restructuring. Optimism over the likely effect of today's Budget on consumer spending impacted favourably across consumer-related stocks. In the drinks sector, shares were marked higher on additional hopes that the chancellor would not come down too heavily on excise duty. Among the main beneficiaries, Scottish  Newcastle added 10 at 492p, Bass - reporting results tomorrow - 14 at 493p, Grand Metropolitan - with figures due Thursday - 19 at 409p and Greenalls Group 10 at 381p. Merrydown was a notable omission, slipping 8 to 210p on disappointment at the group's dividend. Stores were buoyant. Boots rose 10 to 544p, Dixons 7 to 265p, WH Smith 'A' 20 to 485p, helped by a BZW buy note, Next 11 to 199p and Kingfisher 12 to 679p. Bank shares made rapid progress, as did life and composite insurers as financial sector specialists remained convinced there will be no big changes affecting life policies and pensions in the Budget. Barclays, up 13 at 569p, led the banks higher, while Prudential jumped 7 1/2 to 357 1/2 p, spearheading the life sector. Westland Group advanced 9 to 235p as vague takeover talk pointed to GKN. The latter's shares put on 7 at 491p. AAF Industries jumped 11 to 49p after announcing an Pounds 18.4m deal. BBA Group retreated 11 to 178p on reports of a downgrading from Cazenove.

China and Vietnam restored 'normal' relations in November after years of tension, but the rapprochement was quickly soured by territorial disputes on land and at sea. In May, China signed an agreement with Crestone Energy of the US to explore for oil in an area of the South China Sea between Vietnam and Malaysia and 1,000km south of the Chinese island of Hainan. Vietnam said the zone was on its continental shelf. The latest dispute concerns a Chinese rig and seismic survey ships working off the northern Vietnamese province of Thai Binh in the Gulf of Tonkin. 'I think China will have to respond to the Vietnamese requests for an immediate halt to the oil-drilling and other activities in Vietnam's territorial waters,' Mr Le Mai, Vietnamese deputy foreign minister, told Reuters at the non-aligned summit in Jakarta. Asked if Vietnam would use force, he said: 'We do not want to seem as if we are preparing for confrontation. The question of territorial sovereignty is sacred to every nation.' On Saturday the Chinese foreign ministry said the Chinese ships were exploring in waters under Chinese jurisdiction. 'This is not something new, but the continuation of the oil exploration that has been going on there for quite some time,' it said. Even if Hanoi wanted to retaliate, Vietnam's navy is apparently too weak to mount operations against Chinese incursions or deter further encroachments. Instead, Vietnam is seeking common cause with other countries concerned about possible Chinese expansionism.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

The test was conducted at the ministry's Institute of Space  and Aeronautical Science rocket test site at Noshiro in Akita  Prefecture on the west coast of northern Japan.    The M-14 motor has a diameter of 2.5 meters, a length of  13.7  meters, and weighs 92 tons. It can develop a thrust of up to  382 tons.    The test team said the fuel used in the test matched their  expectations and the equipment regulating the thrust operated  normally.    The fuel was ignited at 11:30 A.M. under a cloudy sky with a  strong easterly wind. About 71 tons of fuel was consumed over  80 seconds.    Journalists covering the event about a kilometer away could  hear the rumbling of the horizontally positioned motor as it  spewed orange flame and white smoke out over the Sea of Japan.    Development of the M-5 began in the 1990s, but was delayed  because it was accorded lower development priority than the  smaller 1.8-meter-diameter solid-fuel rocket booster used in the  National Space Development Agency's large-scale liquid-fuel  rocket, the H-2.    This autumn, in-flight combustion tests of the second-stage  motor, M-24, will be conducted, and in 1995, fuel will be tested  in a second experimental version of the M-14 using the same  high- tensile steel as in the actual rocket.    The first rocket is scheduled to carry a scientific  satellite  known as Muses-B from the Kagoshima Space Center in 1996.     "

Petro-Canada's main competitors are Imperial Oil, a subsidiary of Exxon, and Shell Canada, controlled by Royal Dutch Shell. The domestic industry's sales of refined petroleum products slipped by 7 per cent last year, following a 2.7 per cent fall in 1990. Over the next 6-18 months, Petro-Canada will cut 80,000 barrels a day in refining capacity, mainly at plants in British Columbia and Ontario. It is also seeking a joint-venture partner or buyer for a refinery in Montreal. The company also plans to close or sell one-third of its 3,200 retail and 340 wholesale outlets. It has already sold a number of exploration properties and reduced capital spending in line with a 50 per cent shortfall in expected cash flows last year. The refining and marketing business lost CDollars 106m in the first nine months of last year. The company said the division will post a small operating loss, before the special charge, in the fourth quarter. Petro-Canada was created as Canada's national energy company during the mid-1970s energy crisis to give Ottawa a window on the oil industry. It grew mainly by buying assets from foreign-controlled oil companies, including BP and Belgium's Petrofina.  The Financial Times   London Page 23  "

He also called on the  Pacific Basin Economic Council to help stabilize security  concerns in the Asia-Pacific region by creating economic  activity.    He was speaking during a defense and security session of the  27th Pacific Basin Economic Council [PBEC] meeting yesterday  afternoon. The PBEC, he said, could help alleviate the situation  in the Peninsula and help North Korea to ""enter the mainstream  of the Pacific Basin community"" by inviting the North to  participate in PBEC activities. Prospects of greater trade  opportunities and investments can ""provide some incentives for  North Korea to respond positively to any PBEC initiative in that  direction.""    Mr. de Villa also suggested that the PBEC develop a vital  role in the economic pursuits in the South China Sea where there  is a need for continuing dialogues on the demilitarization of  the area. Maintenance of the status quo is necessary ""with  respect to the claims of sovereignty and exploration of possible  modes of cooperation in scientific research, inventory,  exploitation and development of its resources with the  participation of the claimant countries,"" he added.    Corporate involvement in enhancing the security and  stability  of the region is vital, said Secretary de Villa. Although the  Asia- Pacific region has managed to adapt ""rather well"" to the  changes in the international community with the end of the Cold  War, it still faces problems of ""incalculable impact on peaceful  endeavors amidst the optimism in the economic progress of the  region.""

The purchase, which is subject to various approvals, would be the latest in a series of Australian investments taken by MMC. It already holds stakes in Ashton Mining, the diamond mining company, and Plutonic Resources, the goldmining and minerals exploration group. The seller in this case is Tooth  Co, an investment holding company and part of the troubled Adsteam group. Tooth currently owns almost 49 of National Consolidated, and proposes to retain a 3.74 per cent stake if the MMC sale, at ADollars 1.26 a share, is approved. Adsteam itself owns a further 17.8 per cent of National Consolidated. The sale is subject to approval from National Consolidated and Tooth shareholders, Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, and Central Bank Malaysia. Tooth has also granted MMC an option over 19.9 per cent of National Consolidated's shares, exercisable if a third party emerges to bid for NCL and shareholder approval for the Tooth/MMC deal is not forthcoming. Yesterday, in a statement, MMC said that it was not 'the present intention of MMC to launch a takeover bid for NCL but, as in the case of its other large investments in Australian listed companies, to maintain a substantial long term shareholding'. The company pulled out of tin mining, previously its core activity, last year, and has been diversifying activities. NCL returned to profit in 1993-94 after several years of losses, on a reduced sales base of just over Dollars 200m, having sold its building materials operations in 1993.

'We are going to place in the market shares valued at Rs30bn. Half of it will be in the domestic market and the rest in the international market,' said Mr SK Manglik, ONGC's chairman. State-owned ONGC, one of Asia's largest oil exploration firms, was converted into a public limited company on February 1. Formed in 1959, it employs 48,000 and has assets of Rs89.4bn. The company made a record net profit of Rs20bn in 1993-94, a 153 per cent increase over the previous year. It produced 24.21m tonnes of crude during the year. Mr Manglik said the company hoped to make its domestic issue around June or July. 'We are thinking of going in for the international GDR (Global Depositary Receipt issue) in the latter part of the year,' he said. 'As of today, we have no intention of changing our plan but we will be alive to the environment and keep a watch,' he said. 'After all, who expected VSNL, which is a very good company, to bomb like this?' he added. The VSNL Euro-issue of GDRs, certificates representing domestic equity, was to have been priced on Tuesday after roadshows around the world. However, the ambitious offering, riding on the back of India's economic liberalisation programme, fell victim to falling global interest in emerging markets after the US Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates. ONGC sources said the domestic price for a share was expected to be fixed around Rs140 to Rs150.   Companies:-  Oil and Natural Gas Corp.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

Havana Asset Management, a new subsidiary of Beta Funds International, will manage the planned Cuba investment fund, which is expected to be established early next year. Mr Peter Scott, Beta's chief executive, said its expected areas of investment included hotels and tourism, mining, food and beverages, the high-tech pharmaceutical sector and specialised manufacturing. It would invest in new joint venture companies, existing Cuban companies and foreign companies with a significant exposure to Cuba. Beta specialises in spotting new markets and pioneered the creation of investment management companies in Vietnam and Poland. It has more than Dollars 230m invested in emerging markets. The Cuban government has opened up sectors of the economy to foreign investors. It has signed more than 100 new trade and investment deals, from oil exploration and mining to cosmetics and textiles. Mr Scott said the Cuba fund had aroused interested in the UK, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Spain, Italy and Mexico. Besides Beta, the other shareholders in Havana Asset Management are Nueva Compania de Indias, a Spanish trading company operating in Cuba, and James Miura, of Ninecastle Overseas, a UK investment management company. Mr Scott said Cuba had provided legal safeguards for foreign investors by signing investment promotion and protection agreements with a number of countries, including the UK. Mr Scott said the fund's articles would not permit the participation of investors from the US, whose government maintains a trade and financial embargo against Cuba. He believed relations between Cuba and the US would follow the same path as Vietnam, against which Washington lifted a long-standing economic embargo earlier this year.

The sources, including officials of the Vietnamese Foreign  Ministry, said the number of Chinese naval vessels dispatched to  the area has increased amid heightening tension between the two  countries over the issue of oil concessions.    Some sources, including a diplomat of one of the members of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), suggested a  military conflict could break out depending on how Vietnam  reacts to the latest Chinese moves.    Chinese ships in the area are said to number eight,  including  at least one frigate and two research ships, as well as landing  craft, torpedo boats and data collection vessels.    Unconfirmed reports are circulating to the effect that  Vietnam has rushed its own naval vessels to the area.    Hanoi is said to have stationed Navy ships on a regular  basis  at an ostensible fishing port facility that it built last year  on one of the Spratly Islands.    The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday Vietnam holds  sole rights to exploit natural resources in the Tuchinh and  Thanhlong (Blue Dragon) areas in the South China Sea.    China on Thursday criticized Vietnam's contract with U.S.  oil  company Mobil Corp. and Japanese partners to explore the area as  ""illegal"" and a violation of Beijing's sovereignty but said the  dispute should be resolved peacefully. Beijing claims  ""irrevocable sovereignty"" over the entire area around the  Spratly Islands, including the adjacent area where Mobil has  said it would continue with offshore oil exploration work.    The Spratly Islands are also claimed by Vietnam, Taiwan, the  Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia.     "

The company, part of the USX group, said operating income (before a Dollars 13m gain from the sale of a coal seam) rose to Dollars 93m. This represented Dollars 36 for each of the 2.6m tons produced, compared with Dollars 27 a ton on production of 2.5m tons the year before. Mr Charles Corry, chairman, said that 'ongoing price improvement and efficient operating levels throughout our plants' meant that the company was positioned to improve its results further. Overall, US Steel's net income jumped Dollars 57m, to Dollars 90m. The latest period was lifted by one-off credits of Dollars 32m, compared with Dollars 11m in the year-ago quarter. US Steel, like Marathon and Delhi, other subsidiaries of USX, has a separate quote on the New York Stock Exchange. Its earnings per share reached Dollars 1.11, up from 41 cents. Marathon, meanwhile, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 102m on sales of Dollars 3.5bn, compared with Dollars 30m on sales of Dollars 3bn the year before. The results were lifted by a net Dollars 48m from asset disposals, after deducting a charge for an inventory valuation adjustment and reorganisation costs. A higher oil price helped the company to report exploration and production profits of Dollars 73m, compared with a loss of Dollars 9m the year before. Operating income from refining and marketing slipped to Dollars 123m from Dollars 146m, reflecting the lower profit margins on refined products being achieved by all energy groups.

Of the 129 ""economic  partnerships,"" 32 are tourism-oriented, said the Cuban official,  whose remarks were published on Monday by the business weekly  OPCIONES.    The weekly, which was first published in January by JUVENTUD  REBELDE, the official mouthpiece of the Union of Young  Communists (UJC), is aimed at foreign businessmen interested in  investing in the island.    Melendez, director of foreign investment in Cuba, also  disclosed that his ministry has received 149 more applications  to form joint ventures, the first of which appeared three years  ago.    ""We form partnerships with foreign businessmen who provide  financing, capital for new facilities, and modern technology  that allows us to produce on a competitive level,"" he pointed  out. Melendez explained that most foreign investment in Cuba  comes from Spain, followed by France, Great Britain, the  Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden, which are also primary sources.  He added that Europe has invested more capital than America,  including Canada, Mexico, Chile, and the Caribbean nations, and  the duration of partnerships fall within a 10-25 year range.    Melendez explained that coinvestments range from the  exploration and exploitation of oil to industrial production and  tourism administration. Nevertheless, he rejected the  possibility of ""speculative or questionable operations"" in the  future.    Melendez said that multinational conferences on investment  will be held this year in Cuba and will be similar to those  sponsored by the British editorial group Euromoney in 1993 in  London, Cancun, Mexico City, and Havana.    A constitutional reform in 1992 permitted joint ownership of  capital goods in Cuba, an unprecedented shift in the country's  former state monopoly-type economic structure.     "

'Economic reform will inevitably have some unpleasant effects on companies with monopoly positions,' he says. 'But I believe that this kind of reform provides challenges and opportunities for development.' Sinochem, as the giant state trading corporation is known - the company ranked 29th in 1992 on the Fortune 500 list - has been obliged to enter 50-50 joint ventures with the China National Petroleum Corporation for crude exports, and with the China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) for the marketing of refined products. Formation of the new joint venture companies, China Oil and the China International United Chemical Orporation (Unipec), represents one of the biggest shake-ups in China's oil sector in many years, and also coincides with the abolition of the Ministry of Energy under a streamlining of the bureaucracy approved this year by the National People's Congress, China's parliament. Mr Wang Tao, chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation, left no doubt in an interview that he derived particular satisfaction from the new arrangements that will involve CNPC not only in the production of crude, but also in marketing. He plans to use extra revenues from these ventures to further develop CNPC's activities domestically, including investments in refineries. CNPC is also interested in expanding its reach abroad through its China National Development Company, established in 1981, to seek opportunities in exploration and development, but whose activities have been severely curtailed because of lack of funds. Changes in the oil sector also coincide with the beginning of a period of heightened activity involving foreign companies in the search for oil in China's onshore regions, especially in the promising Tarim basin area of far-western Xinjiang region. Mr Wang said earlier this year that in addition to the 11 southern provinces of China which had already been opened to foreign involvement, an additional 12 areas would also be offered, including remote regions of Qinghai province and Xinjiang in the west, and Inner Mongolia in the north-west. China attracted a good response from the oil majors in March when it offered five blocs in the prospective Tarim basin covering an area of 72,730 sq km. EFFORTS to engage foreign companies in the development of China's oil reserves (estimated at 30bn barrels) are being given added urgency by the likelihood that by 1995 at the latest the country will become a net crude oil importer. Mr Wang estimates that exports will exceed exports this year by about 4m tonnes. Onshore production this year is expected to be much the same as last year's 138m tonnes. But he warned that with economic growth anticipated this year of about 13 per cent, it was unrealistic to expect that China could continue to produce more oil than it consumed without big new discoveries. 'The petroleum industry is developing like a tortoise, and GNP growth like a hare,' he observes. Even if good discoveries are made in the Tarim basin, it will be some years, and possibly not until the turn of the century before oil is flowing in large quantities from China's far west. The cost of building a pipeline more than 2,000 kms from the Tarim area across rugged terrain to connect with the national pipeline grid is estimated at about UDollars 2bn. Exploration activity is also continuing in offshore areas; although the crushing disappointment, not to mention huge losses, suffered by Western companies such as British Petroleum in the 1980s in a fruitless search, has dampened much of the early enthusiasm. Mr Chen Binqian, vice president of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), said his organisation was pressing on with its efforts to engage foreign companies in prospective areas offshore, such as the East China Sea, the Pearl River delta, and waters off Hainan Island in the south. Mr Chen expects to have awarded contracts for 13 concessions in the East China Sea by the end of the year. CNOOC itself continues to be active in its efforts to lift production at its own wells in areas such as the Bohai Sea, in China's northern water, where it brought onstream a new field in September. It is also looking forward to Agip, Chevron, Texaco, Philips and Amoco bringing relatively small fields into production between 1994-1996 in the Pearl River area. This year, CNOOC expects oil production from offshore areas to reach 5m tonnes - and to grow to about 12m tonnes by 1997. But disappointed by results of oil exploration offshore, it is looking increasingly to its gas finds to justify its own existence, and to provide energy to fuel China's booming economy, especially in its energy-deficient southern regions, and Hong Kong. By 1996, CNOOC expects to be supplying 2.9bn cu. metres annually to Hong Kong, and 500m cu. metres to Hainan island itself from fields off the island's south coast. More finds are being made in waters off Hainan, and CNOOC hopes to be supplying 20bn cu. metres to consumers in Hong Kong and on the mainland by early next century.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.

Earnings were CDollars 55.5m (USDollars 41.4m), or 32 cents a share, compared with a CDollars 11.4m loss, or 11 cents, a year earlier. Operating income more than quadrupled to CDollars 94.6m from CDollars 21.5m, while revenues climbed to CDollars 526.7m from CDollars 371.1m. The results were also buoyed by a reduction in debt-service expenses from CDollars 21.1m to CDollars 10.9m in the wake of the recent equity issue. Mr Frank Pickard, chief executive, predicted that nickel prices would be supported for the rest of the year by a 10 per cent rise in western steel output in 1994, and a 9 per cent increase in nickel consumption. 'Fourth-quarter fundamentals are the strongest the nickel industry has experienced in many years,' he said. Nickel output rose to 17,321 tonnes in the third quarter from 15,633 a year earlier. Ferro-nickel production was 9,068 tonnes, up from 7,021 tonnes. Average nickel prices received rose to USDollars 2.89 a lb from Dollars 2.29. Ferro-nickel prices climbed to Dollars 2.80 from Dollars 2.37, while copper prices advanced to Dollars 1.13 from 86 cents. Falconbridge also disclosed yesterday it had obtained 'particularly encouraging' exploration results from the Kidd Creek zinc and copper mine in northern Ontario. Samples from four new drill-holes have yielded an average grade of 3 per cent copper, 4.8 per cent zinc, 0.85 per cent lead and 180 grams of silver per tonne. Drilling results from the Biankouma nickel venture in the Ivory Coast indicate the ore may be suitable for ferro-nickel production, using the same process as Falconbridge's operation in the Dominican Republic.

Minerals have always been a mainstay of the Bolivian economy, but successive price collapses affecting silver, tin and antimony drove minerals exports down to less than one third of Bolivian foreign exchange earnings in 1986. Today, with zinc and gold output increasing rapidly, minerals again account for almost half of export revenue: some Dollars 380m last year. An estimated 80,000 Bolivians still depend on mining for their livelihoods, some of them literally scratching ore from narrow veins in underground shafts with long, primitive nails. But the open-cast mines and heap-leaching techniques being introduced by foreign concerns in joint ventures with Bolivians point to a different mining future. 'Eight years ago, no one would touch Bolivia,' says Mr Charles Bruce, chief executive officer of local mining consultancy Mintec. 'Even in 1991, there were only four foreign companies operating here: now there are 40.' Simultaneously, the state is rapidly withdrawing from productive mining activities. While mining giant Comibol was responsible in its 1980-85 heyday for about two-thirds of all Bolivia's tin and zinc output, by last year its share had fallen to 35 and 20 per cent respectively. Comibol's smelters and refineries are on the capitalisation list. Mines, deposits and exploration areas, meanwhile, are being made available to private investors either via leasing contracts or joint ventures with Comibol to get round constitutional restraints on ownership transfer of nationalised assets. Only three of Comibol's mines are operational: Huanuni, Colquiri and Caracoles. Continuing losses obliged the remainder to be closed down. Comibol's workforce, which peaked at almost 30,000 in 1984, has been cut back severely - mainly in the second half of the 1980s - to some 2,500, of whom more than 1,000 are employed at the Vinto smelter complex. Cash flow is now positive. Comibol's most attractive opportunities are in the department of Oruro, on the altiplano south of La Paz. Largest is the Huanuni tin deposit near the town of Oruro, originally owned by Bolivian tin magnate Simon Patino. Despite its already-long life, Huanuni has some 8m tonnes of proven and inferred reserves and mining experts consider prospects for further finds bright. Colquiri has good unexploited zinc reserves along with its tin. And the polymetallic San Jose mine, non-operational since mid-1992, could also prove an interesting prospect for zinc and gold; its traditional lead-silver concentrates will acquire new worth if and when the Karachipampa smelter is finally started up. Comsur (Bolivia's largest mining concern, owned by the Sanchez de Lozada family and now in association with Rio Tinto Zinc) will be the first private company to commence joint production with Comibol. Comsur-RTZ has put up Dollars 15.8m for a lead-zinc concentrator at Comibol's under-exploited Bolivar deposit. Profits from the 15,000 tonnes of concentrate, the projected output from next year onwards, will be split 50-50. 'We've found Comibol to be very good partners,' says Comsur's CEO Mr John MacLean. 'Reserves are better than expected; we're on budget and on time.' Part of the attraction for foreign companies is the modern 1991 mining code which guarantees equal treatment for foreign and national companies and free remittances of profits abroad. Foreigners may now also - in joint ventures with Bolivians - explore and develop the previously prohibited but potentially rich zones within 50km of Bolivia's borders. The code is being further modified to improve the present chaotic claims procedures and to clarify certain elements of tax law. Mr Gonzalo Barrientos, under-secretary of mining, is confident that these provisions and promotion of joint ventures with Comibol will boost minerals exports earnings to Dollars 800m within five years - 'and that's without factoring in new exploration,' he says. In the brave new world of Bolivian mining, traditional tin and tungsten have a declining role: tin earned just Dollars 83m last year, down from the 1981 peak of Dollars 266m (even though gross production is little changed). Zinc, however, is on an upward path: last year's sales of Dollars 120m represented 16 per cent of total Bolivian export earnings. And revenue from gold should outstrip zinc by next year. To date, exploration has been restricted to the so-called 'Cordillera Real', the traditional silver and tin-mining zone. But new companies, in search of precious metals, are concentrating on the western Cordillera and the pre-Cambrian and greenstone belts east towards the Brazilian borders. Among other diversification possibilities, Bolivian miners are once again talking seriously about developing their iron reserves. 'El Mutun' is a 40,000m tonne deposit - one of the world's largest - with between 30 and 50 per cent iron. It is located in Bolivia's Busch province, some 600km east of Santa Cruz on the border with Brazil. El Mutun's potential has been known for decades but development has been limited to small-scale open-pit exploitation due to local power and transport problems. All operations are presently suspended. A Brazilian-Japanese consortium, however, is reviving a large-scale exploitation project. And the Latin American Integration Association (Aladi) has recently proposed construction of iron and steel plants nearby to serve Bolivia and export to Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.

In a special declaration at the end of a two-day meeting in Manila, the foreign ministers of Asean - grouping Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - emphasised the need to resolve arguments over sovereignty and jurisdiction 'by peaceful means, without resort to force'. They suggested the establishment of 'a code of international conduct over the South China Sea' to be based on the principles of their regional Treaty of Amity and Co-operation, and resolved to explore the possibility of collaborating on maritime navigation, pollution control and anti-piracy operations in the area. The dispute over the Spratlys came to a head earlier this year when China reaffirmed its claim to the entire archipelago and granted an oil exploration licence to a US company in a zone also claimed by Vietnam. Asked whether Asean regarded China as a bully, Mr Raul Manglapus, foreign minister of the Philippines, replied: 'We have said China has its own historical claims which we might reject in the light of 20th century realities, but we have never said it's a bully.' A decision to set aside the issue of sovereignty over the Spratlys did not mean that the countries concerned could not peacefully continue or even reinforce their presence on the islands, he said. For the first time since it was founded 25 years ago in the shadow of the spread of communism in Indochina, Asean explicitly put the emphasis on security concerns. In another sign of the changing international climate, Vietnam and Laos were yesterday granted observer status at future Asean meetings.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

A joint communique released at the end of a three-day visit to Vietnam by China's President Jiang Zemin said the two governments agreed to 'refrain from all acts that make things more complicated or broaden conflicts'. The dispute over the South China Sea is especially sensitive, because each country is seeking to exploit oil and gas reserves believed to lie under the sea bed. Both countries have awarded oil exploration contracts to US oil companies in disputed waters. Mr Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister, said in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi the two sides could shelve disputes and start 'joint development' if problems could not be resolved in talks immediately. Joint development of possible oil and gas fields in disputed maritime areas is a proven method of overcoming conflicts between two countries, but might not succeed in all areas of the sea because there are four other claimants to some or all of the islands: Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. Relations between Hanoi and Beijing have improved in the past few years. But Vietnamese officials say China has recently encroached on their territory near the border, refused to open a railway link to allow normal trade across the land frontier, and let Chinese traders smuggle cheap Chinese goods into Vietnam. Mr Jiang's visit, the first by a Chinese president, may not have brought much in the way of concrete achievements, but suggests the two governments want to set aside their differences and concentrate on the similar challenges each faces: keeping their one-party communist political systems intact while liberalising the economy.

0,FT934-5297 ,"FT934-5297 _AN-DLACFAGYFT 931130   FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green cloud hangs over Ecuadorean oil sector - Raymond Colitt reports on a wave of protest that has potential investors worried      By RAYMOND COLITT   Only months before the Ecuadorean government is to invite foreign oil companies to bid for new exploration blocks in the country's Amazon region - potentially worth billions of dollars - a new wave of protests by environmentalists and indigenous groups has investors worried. The latest in a series of actions against oil companies in the region came earlier this month as several aboriginal communities filed a civil law suit against the US oil company Texaco. The Indians of various tribes in the Amazon forests are demanding of Texaco an indemnity in addition to legal costs of at least USDollars 50,000 for each of the affected inhabitants of the area, which could run into thousands of people. Separately the plaintiffs are to claim clean-up costs that may, according to some estimates, reach hundreds of millions of dollars. Texaco is accused of negligence, recklessness and intentional damage in its exploration and production activities. These are alleged to have increased the risk of cancer, respiratory and gastro-intestinal illnesses and to have caused other personal injuries and property damages. According to Mr Cristobal Bonifaz, a lawyer for the Indians, Texaco did not always employ technologies and practices that met industry standards. For example, toxic substances, he said, were not disposed of properly, but were rather 'dumped' into pits, rivers and bogs or burnt without any pollution control. Mr Bonifaz adds that the environmental damage in Ecuador's Amazon region far exceeds that caused by the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska three years ago. Texaco has not operated in the fields of the Oriente, as Ecuador's Amazonian region is called, since 1990, when its contract with the Ecuadorean government expired and it withdrew after 20 years as the principal operator from a consortium with the state-owned Petroecuador. The US petroleum company denies the allegations and argues that the case should have been filed in Ecuador, where Petroecuador is legally established. Yet the plaintiffs argue that the defendant is legally a resident of New York and that all decisions regarding operations in Ecuador were essentially taken in the US. Meanwhile, Texaco awaits the results of an environmental audit initiated by the Ecuadorean government itself to determine exactly what environmental damage has been caused and what the reparation cost might be. The results of a study conducted by a Canadian environmental consulting firm are expected soon. Ecuador's minister of energy and mining, Mr Franciso Acosta, says that he will not sign any new contract with Texaco - which seeks to commercialise petrol within Ecuador - until the environmental review has been completed and Texaco has renewed its commitment to abide by it. The validity of the audit has been questioned by environmental groups in the US and Ecuador because of the lack of public access to information, the exclusion of local communities from the process and the terms of the audit, which were set by Texaco and Petroecuador. Laws and regulations that might substantiate specific infractions against Texaco are scarce. Ecuador has only recently adopted environmental regulations specific to the petroleum industry. Yet first the court for the southern district of New York must be signed to hear the case. That considerable environmental damage has been caused in the Oriente is beyond question. Countless acres of rain forest have disappeared, water and soil have been polluted by oil spills and animal habitats have been destroyed. According to a government estimate nearly 17m gallons of oil has leaked out of the Texaco-operated pipeline. Preliminary results from an independent study by the US-based Institute on Economic and Social Rights indicates that in areas in which Texaco operated there is evidence of the presence of toxic substances like benzine and toluol in excess of levels deemed tolerable by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Yet the company maintains that its emergency clean-up efforts were effective and that oil spills, often due to natural disasters, represented only a small percentage of the total amount transported during 18 years of operation. Texaco is not the only company accused of environmental improprieties. Only days before the legal suit against Texaco, members of the Cofan tribe - armed with spears and shotguns - forced drilling to be suspended at a Petroecuador site. The Cofanes demanded that the exploratory work within a national park and close to their tribal lands be halted. Especially indignant at President Duran Ballen's decision to allow resumption of exploratory work after having previously suspended it because of environmental concerns, they contended that they were not consulted about the activities as is required by law. Confrontation is certain to continue as the Cofanes insist that Petroecuador withdraw from their lands. Petroecuador has already had to shut down one of its most promising sites - Tiputini Panacocha, also located in the national park - following a decree by the government's environmental agency in response to supposed damage. Despite assurances to potential investors by the energy minister, potentially interested oil companies are wary of increasing confrontation by indigenous peoples and environmental groups that might lead to costly legal battles and an image problem at home.

The company was floated on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday in a deal which valued it at Dollars 375m (Pounds 252m). The shares were priced at Dollars 15 each, compared with the Dollars 17-Dollars 19 range at which Pearson had said it intended to sell a majority stake. The lower valuation put on the company is in line with the drop in share prices at other oil services companies in recent weeks. Lower oil prices prompt companies to cut back or delay exploration and development work, reducing the demand for drilling and other activities undertaken by service companies. Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, said it raised Pounds 200m in cash from the sale of 55 per cent of Camco. Part of the proceeds were in the form of a Dollars 105m repayment of inter-company debt. In addition to the 13.75m shares sold yesterday, a further 2m could be sold as part of an over-allotment provision. The initial public offering was part of a move by the UK company to focus resources on developing its media interests. Pearson has said it intends to keep its remaining 45 per cent interest in Camco 'for a limited period.' The shares were trading at their launch price of Dollars 15 at lunchtime in New York. The sale comes at a time of consolidation in the oilfield services industry. A weak oil price, the need to invest in new technology and the growing tendency of big oil companies to hire service companies to manage all aspects of a project have combined to put pressure on smaller companies.

The pioneering institute was jointly sponsored by the  Tianjin  Building Materials Research Institute and the Building Research  Center of the University of New South Wales in Australia.    Establishment of the institute marks the beginning of the  adoption of a new way for Chinese scientific research  institutions to cooperate with foreign partners.

0,FT942-7161 ,"FT942-7161 _AN-EEZDOAGTFT 940526   FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Economic reform brings golden dawn in Peru - The flood of foreign miners into South America's 'new Eldorado'      By SALLY BOWEN   To judge from the interest shown in last week's first ever gold symposium held in Lima, Peru is now seen as the continent's new Eldorado. More than 800 gold experts - geologists, metallurgists, traders, environmentalists and just plain miners - attended the three-day event. 'It's like Chile was 15 years ago,' said Mr Johan Smit of Newcrest's Peruvian subsidiary. 'There's a 'let's go' feeling which is tremendously exciting. It's the herd instinct, but in this case the herd is right.' Acting as chief magnet for foreign interest - and drawing gold prospectors to the north-central Andean department of Cajamarca - is the successful Minera Yanacocha operation, a joint venture between Newmont Mining of Denver, leading local group Buenaventura and France's BRGM. Yanacocha is a perfect advertisement for the opportunities on offer in Peru today. Its gold, in a low-grade disseminated deposit, was commercially unrecoverable until the development of leaching techniques over the past decade. Now, since coming on stream last August, the company has clawed back its Dollars 37m initial investment in just seven months. Carachugo, Yanacocha's first deposit, has mineable reserves in excess of 28m tonnes averaging 1.38 grams of gold per tonne. By November a second, nearby deposit known as Maqui Maqui will be producing its first dore bullion. Larger and richer even than Carachugo, Maqui Maqui promises 40m tonnes of ore at an average 1.91 grams a tonne. Unlike Carachugo, whose porous ore can be scooped up and dumped directly on to leach-pads, Maqui Maqui will be exploited as an open-cast mine. Trials indicate the leaching cycle will take 120 days with a 60 per cent recovery rate, compared with Carachugo's exceptional 35-day cycle, 80 per cent recovery. Development of Maqui Maqui is costing Newmont and partners Dollars 40m. With production costs around Dollars 150 a troy ounce and projected annual output of 180,000 ounces, Minera Yanacocha is on to another hugely profitable operation. Combined output from the two Yanacocha deposits should top 400,000 ounces next year. That alone will boost national gold production to close to 40 tonnes a year and catapult Peru up the Latin American gold league table, still well behind Brazil but vying for second place with Chile. Gold would then become Peru's second most important export after copper. Hard on the heels of Newmont in the current Peruvian gold rush is American Barrick, also Nevada-based. In the past six months, Barrick has established an aggressive presence, with 'between 40 and 60' geologists and minerals experts sizing up maybe a dozen Peruvian prospects. Barrick is already drilling at Cerro Corona in Cajamarca. The company is tight-lipped about its findings but industry rumours credit Cerro Corona with some 15m tonnes at 3 grams a tonne in an 'attractive, eminently leachable oxide cap' with huge sulphide deposits below. Initial investment is expected to be in the region of Dollars 20m. An equally enthusiastic newcomer to Peru is Canada's Cambior, which in March acquired the Cajamarca copper deposits of La Granja. Investing an initial Dollars 31m in the five-year exploration stage, Cambior expects to start drilling in June. Simultaneously, the Canadian company will begin development of a recently-acquired gold deposit in the remote eastern jungle department of Apurimac, the first foreign company to venture into a zone hitherto considered dangerous. Some 35 people are involved in Cambior's Peruvian operation and investment in exploration locally is 'double what we're spending in Chile this year', according to Mr Andre Gauthier, Cambior's regional manager. Yet another Canadian company, Placer Dome, has also gained a foothold in Peru. In January, it outbid Newmont to secure a gold deposit known as Jehuamarca-Canariaco in the northern department of Lambayeque. Initial studies are under way. All of this is good news for the long-suffering Peruvian mining community. Inward-looking, nationalistic and protectionist economic policies meant Peru had been shunned by international investors for a full 25 years. With the exception of the giant Asarco-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation and Japan's Mitsui - which has continued with a low-profile operation - mining development has been left to local companies. 'Four hundred mining concerns have closed down in the past 15 years and the rest are badly decapitalised,' said Mr Roque Benavides, president of the national mining society. 'There's been almost no new exploration. The deposits you see today were known in the 1960s.' Privatisation was an initial trigger for international investors. AngloAmerican/Mantos Blancos, Cyprus Minerals and China's Shougang Corporation, in addition to Placer Dome and Cambior, all acquired their stakes by bidding for formerly state-owned deposits at public auction. Other foreign investors are forming associations with Peruvian mine-owners, many of whom hold promising claims but cannot finance development. Still others are participating in the anticipated boom by acquiring shares - many leading Peruvian mining companies have large, liquid holdings available for purchase through the Lima stock exchange. But for many mining concerns like Newcrest and RTZ, Peru's attraction lies in its largely unexplored territory. Over the past year, Peru's mines ministry has seen twice as many claims lodged as in the previous four decades. 'In Peru, the nice surprises come from grass-roots exploration,' says Mr Smit. With increasingly attractive macro-economic conditions and a much improved security situation, it seems plenty of foreign investors agree.   Countries:-  PEZ  Peru, South America.

The interim dividend is maintained at 70 cents a share. The group looks set to arrest a four-year slide in earnings by the year-end in June as the recovery in the gold price in 1993 translated into sharply higher dividend receipts from its gold mining investments. The turnround in the gold market also masks the disappointing performance of the group's R1.7bn developing Northam Platinum mine and struggling base metal operations, knocked by the downward drift in copper, lead and zinc prices for much of the past year. Investment income rose to R133m from R115m, more than making up for a decline in interest receipts on the group's lower cash reserves. Costs and expenditure were flat at R86m including exploration spending of R19m, of which one-third was spent on the group's recently-acquired gold mining interests in Ghana, Ecuador and Venezuela. With a negligible tax provision of R5m against R12m last year, after-tax income was up at R138m against R124m. Mr Robin Plumbridge, chairman, said he was confident of a modest improvement in bottom line profit at the year end from the R287m reported last year with the rise in interim distributable profit to R132m from R118m. The 'surprising strength' of the gold market as prices returned to Dollars 390 in December boded well for the year ahead as it seemed the price spike to more than Dollars 400 in mid-93 had not done sustained damage to demand for gold from jewellers.

Minerals are part of the nation's wealth, but China is  getting inadequate return from mining because of the industry's  traditional management and benefit distribution system.    Under the old system, mining enterprises were deemed to own  the minerals they dug out.    There was no need for them to pay the State anything so they  were left to enjoy the fruits of any profits they made.    Even now, to get easy cash, some enterprises abandon mines  once they have dug out the most accessible minerals.    Meanwhile, others dig where they please leading to a further  waste of the nation's resources.    The old mining system cannot satisfy consumption when the  national economy is growing fast.    And despite China seemingly having abundant mineral  resources, the amount per head is less than half the average  world figure.    Mining enterprises, instead of relying on government funds,  should try to fund exploration for new ores themselves.    Licence    The problems in the industry are now so grave that a new  management system and legislation must be drawn up.    The new system should make fresh mineral resources the  property of the State and mining enterprises should apply for  licenses to the government before digging starts. In addition,  they should pay the State for the use of mines.    It is also essential that mines improve their equipment and  technology if they are to avoid further wasting mineral  resources Only a new management and benefit distribution system  can ease the industry's growth, improve the supply of raw  materials and so boost manufacturing in the socialist market  economy.

The Australian group is buying Union Zinc, which has five low-cost zinc mines and a 100,000 tonnes a year smelter employing 650 in Tennessee. The self-contained business accounts for 25 per cent of US zinc output. This is the second disposal in a week by UM as part of its 1993 long-term plan to dispose of non-strategic assets to fund investments in its core business. Last week it sold its 56 per cent stake in Asturienne, the Belgian mining group. UM had been planning to float Union Zinc on the American market but preferred the Savage offer because 'it could be concluded immediately for a similar return'. Savage came to prominence because of its successful litigation against Western Mining of Australia over the Ernest Henry copper-gold deposit in Queensland. It then sold 51 per cent of Ernest Henry to MIM, another Australian resources group, for ADollars 92.5m (USDollars 67m). Savage shares were suspended before the deal at ADollars 1.55. It will fund the zinc purchase by a five-for-six renounceable rights issue to existing shareholders at ADollars 1.25 a share and a placement of 50m shares at ADollars 1.29. The placing will be made to institutional clients of Prudential Bache Securities (Australia) and Ord Minnet Securities. Both issues are fully underwritten. UM and Savage will enter into a commercial relationship cemented by UM receiving options to acquire 15m Savage shares (less than 5 per cent of the increased capital). UM is a major cobalt producer.

The remaining Dollars 200m would be used to expand and modernise refinery capacity and retail network. YPF was partially privatised in June when the government sold 45 per cent of the company for Dollars 3.04bn. The investment programme is to be financed from cashflow and debt. In the nine months to September, YPF reported net income of Dollars 394m, against Dollars 145m in the same period of 1992. Mr Cedric Bridger, vice-president, said YPF would launch Dollars 850m-worth of bonds, to be spearheaded early next year by a Dollars 350m fixed rate, 10-year Yankee bond programme. Mr Bridger said the Yankee bonds, to be placed by CS First Boston, would be used to retire Dollars 200m-worth of costly local and World Bank debt and replenish working capital. He said pricing would be decided after the government had placed Dollars 750m-worth of Global bonds today. YPF hopes to achieve similar or better terms for its bonds. The Yankee bonds will be followed by a Dollars 500m medium-term global note programme.   Companies:-  Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

The two countries also signed an agreement on cooperation in  export processing zone development.    The two agreements were signed here by P.K. Chiang and  Nigerian Trade and Commerce Minister Melford Okilo on behalf of  their respective governments.    Okilo, who arrived in Taipei Monday for a trade promotion  tour, said Taiwan businessmen are welcome to invest in Nigeria.    ""Nigeria spans a large area and has a huge population and  rich natural resources,"" Okilo said. ""We welcome foreign  investment to help boost our economic development.""    Chiang said Nigeria is an important country in West Africa.  ""It is also a promising market worthy of exploration by our  businessmen,"" he noted.    Chiang said Taiwan will help the oil-rich African country  develop an export processing zone (EPZ) in Calabar, a port city  in southeastern Nigeria.    Nigeria has sent personnel to Taiwan to study EPZ  administration and other related expertise during the past two  years.    Chiang said Taiwan will use its international economic  cooperation development fund to offer practical training for  more Nigerian administrators and professionals following the  signing of the EPZ cooperative agreement.    Taiwan does not maintain an embassy in Nigeria, but has a  representative office in Nigeria's largest city of Lagos and a  consulate-general in Calabar.    Taiwan exported U.S.$140 million worth of goods to Nigeria  in  1993, but no official records of imports from that country was  available.    In addition to Nigeria, Taiwan has signed similar investment  protection agreements with 11 other countries -- Argentina,  Indonesia, Latvia, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, the  Philippines, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam.

Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indigenous  Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), said the indigenous people  are willing to take up the last resort, adding that the  indigenous people and others residing in the Amazon region could  even seize the wells ``to prevent additional ecological  disaster.''    The Ecuadoran Government today opened the seventh round of  petroleum bids for the exploration and exploitation of 3.2  million hectares in the Ecuadoran Amazon region and offshore  areas. The indigenous people's representative said the  petroleum companies have caused irreparable damage to the  environment and to the life of the inhabitants of the Ecuadoran  Amazon region.    Macas said, ``The Ecuadoran Government is putting the only  green area left in the Amazon region up for bid, and this is the  reason why we have requested a 15-year moratorium on the  bidding.''    The indigenous leader added that the exploitation of  petroleum has been carried out in an irrational manner and  without consulting the people who are most affected -- namely,  the indigenous people and residents of the Ecuadoran Amazon  region. The Conaie president noted that the indigenous people  have filed a suit with the Human Rights Commission of the OAS,  and he added that the international organization is waiting for  the government to send the commission an invitation to inspect  the oil drilling areas.    Ecuador's environmental and indigenous people's  organizations  this morning took over the Energy and Mines Ministry to pressure  the government not to carry out the bidding. They also  requested a meeting with President Sixto Duran-Ballen.     "

They can see the wrecks up close, listen to  Ballard explain what's going on and ask questions of him and other experts.    Before attending these 90-minute sessions with Ballard, the youngsters work  with an extensive curriculum -- prepared by the National Science Teachers  Foundation -- that includes building milk carton boats only to drown them in a  windstorm.

0,FT943-3008 ,"FT943-3008 _AN-EIPC9ABKFT 940916   FT  16 SEP 94 / World Trade News: UK in investment accord with Cuba      By PASCAL FLETCHER      HAVANA   Britain has signalled strong official encouragement for UK businesses to invest in Cuba with an investment promotion and protection agreement. The agreement was initialled on Wednesday by Britain's trade and technology minister, Mr Ian Taylor. Mr Taylor yesterday referred to Cuba as 'a very exciting market' at the end of a three-day visit, the first by a British minister to the island in almost 20 years. 'Clearly, the potential here is very considerable,' Mr Taylor said. 'The agreement will give confidence that Cuba is a market with which British businesses can deal.' He had led a British business delegation in talks on investment opportunities in air transport, construction, Cuba's sugar sector and insurance. Mr Taylor, clearly distancing British government policy from the US trade and financial embargo against the island, underlined the fact that Britain had never cut its trade links with Cuba. British exports for the first half of this year were up 180 per cent over last year. The 1993 export total was Pounds 14m, which was 50 per cent down from 1992. But he said many British companies had found it difficult to do business in the past because of Cuba's centrally-managed and highly regulated state economy. Cuba was moving to reform its economy to adapt to world trading conditions after the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main trading partner. 'I made it clear that British companies would find dealing with Cuba easier the further the reform process goes,' said Mr Taylor, who had talks with President Fidel Castro. He said that while Cuban reforms were at an early stage, he was assured by Mr Castro they would continue. He noted that British companies were already operating in Cuba in oil exploration and oil services, agrochemicals, lubricants, soap and detergent manufacture, citrus, financial services and the sugar industry.

0,FT933-16553 ,"FT933-16553 _AN-DGBCVAG1FT 930702   FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina aims to cash in on mineral wealth: Law changes designed to attract investors to under-explored areas      By JOHN BARHAM   ARGENTINA OWNS half the mineral-rich southern Andes but its mining industry accounts for a mere 1.5 per cent of its GDP. Unlike Chile, which owns the other half of the southern Andes and has built up a multi-billion dollar mining industry, mining in Argentina has never caught on. Political instability, unpredictable shifts in government policy, complex and xenophobic regulations have actually discouraged mining. For instance, the Andean border region was declared a security zone and closed to foreign investment, while exports were taxed. The government says this is all changing, however, with the approval a few weeks ago of new investor-friendly mining laws that it hopes will open up Argentina's vast and under-explored interior to local and especially to foreign companies. These new laws follow Argentina's introduction four years ago of free market reforms that have transformed the country into one of the fastest-growing economies in the region. The government is offering mining companies a generous tax regime that includes a promise not to change the tax structure of investment projects for 30 years and allows them to import machinery duty free. Companies can write off all their exploration costs against future corporate tax once a project begins generating profits. The laws will also allow companies to set up free trade zones in which remaining tax and import restrictions will be waived. The intention is to attract international companies based on the Chilean side of the Andes to cross into Argentina. Argentina badly needs to attract foreign investment because it lacks home-grown mining expertise. As a result of the endemic indifference to mining, only 17 per cent of its territory has been adequately surveyed. Major mining companies began sniffing around Argentina well before the new mining policies came into effect. The government's mining secretariat reports that 20 companies, nearly all of them foreign, have already committed USDollars 103m in investments to study 64 mining projects. This may be small change by international standards, but it represents a hefty capital influx for an industry that turns over barely Dollars 400m a year. Argentina's great attraction is its virgin geology and consequently the chance of finding major undeveloped deposits with quick payback periods. Some, like Canada's Musto, claim they have already found highly attractive properties. Musto is working on an 18-month, USDollars 7m feasibility study of what it claims to be an exceptionally rich, world-class gold deposit in the Andean foothills. The company says the Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit is 'one of the largest proven unexploited porphyry copper/gold deposits in South America'. It believes the deposit could produce 140m lb of copper and 200,000 ounces of gold a year for 20 years. Mr Jorge Jones, Musto's Argentine general manager, says that if Musto takes up an option to develop Bajo de la Alumbrera, the project will need at least Dollars 450m in investments and would therefore require co-financing from other joint venture partners. The mining secretariat says international companies have at least four other major gold, copper, lithium and potassium projects under consideration, which would be worth over Dollars 500m in investments if taken beyond their present exploration stages. Argentina is so anxious to attract investment that the government has even reassured companies that they have little to fear from its feeble environmental laws. At an international mining conference in Denver in June, Mining Secretary Angel Maza was quoted as saying: 'We would not think of subordinating the interests of development to those of the environment'. Despite its fiscal and geological attractions, Argentina is far from becoming a mining paradise. To start with, its geology is less favourable than Chile's, where rich mineral veins are closer to the surface and therefore cheap to mine. And companies already operating Argentina, like RTZ affiliate Minera Aguilar, which produces lead, silver and zinc close to the Bolivian border, are losing money because prices are low, while their costs are high. Operating costs are high because the currency is overvalued, labour productivity is low and inputs are overpriced. For example, Aguilar has to import items ranging from explosives to spare parts because locally-made products are so expensive. Finding financial backing for mining projects is both difficult and expensive. Local banks are unwilling to lend for long periods, while international banks are unhappy lending for mining projects in a country with little mining tradition. Deficient infrastructure also adds heavily to development costs. Roads and power supplies, especially in remote mountain locations are inadequate. Transport and port facilities are also poor, although the government has recently privatised the rail network and drastically reduced port charges. The government is also negotiating with Chile a series of agreements which would enable companies operating in Argentina's sector of the Andes to buy Chilean electricity and ship minerals to Chilean Pacific ports. Not only are Chile's ports closer, but its road and rail network is far superior to Argentina's. But Mr David Ancieta, Aguilar's executive director, says he is optimistic that Argentina is overcoming what was once seen as its greatest single deterrent - political turbulence. 'There is a determination to change and I think that Argentina will become a politically stable country,' he says. 'Periodic adjustments to economic policy will be necessary, but there is confidence that Argentina will stay with these economic policies.'   Countries:-  ARZ   Argentina, South America.

The colossal Brazilian market is  opening up to Russian businessmen. It is attractive not just by  its size--Russia can operate thereon in the role not only of  exporter of raw material but of supplier of machinery,  equipment, and technology.    The present state of trade relations does not satisfy either  Brazil or Russia. According to Mr. Vieira, in 10 months of 1993,  Brazilian exports to Russia amounted to only $146 million  (Russian exports were only a little more). Trade is at times of  a sporadic nature--from one incidental contract to another--and  many transactions are effected via middlemen. The statement  signed yesterday, on the other hand, opens the Brazilian market  to Russian businessmen. It is planned within five years to reach  a commodity turnover level of a minimum of $2 billion (it will  in 1994 even have doubled compared with the present year). The  trade plans are notable not only for the bare figures alone, for  that matter: As distinct from trade with the West (where exports  to us are supported by government credit, as a rule), trade with  Brazil will be supported by credit from pools of commercial  banks. From the Russian side lines of credit will be provided,  it is anticipated, by, in particular, the Moscow Business Bank,  the Mezhkombank, the Imperial Bank, and the Export-Import Bank.    Brazil's big interest in the Russian market fits perfectly  well within the program of the encouragement of exports with a  simultaneous adjustment of foreign trade priorities which has  been announced by this country. The North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) will create certain problems for South  American commodities, nor is the European Union in any hurry  fully to open its doors to them. Russia and Brazil frequently  run into antidumping measures in respect to identical  commodities (textiles, aluminum, isobutanol, and such) on  European markets, incidentally. Besides expanding the  possibilities for the coordination of trade policy in third  countries, the statement signed yesterday creates a real basis  for the mutual--and conflict-free--realization of the foreign  trade plans of Russia and Brazil.    Thus, Russia, preoccupied with a restructuring of its  agricultural imports (hitherto largely oriented toward the  West), intends to pay more attention to purchases (together with  the traditional coffee and cocoa) of Brazilian soybeans, sugar,  and meat. A certain niche in Russian imports could be filled by  inexpensive Brazilian footwear also. The Brazilians, in turn,  are interested in Russian turbines and engines, chemical  fertilizers, and raw material for the chemical industry and  pharmaceuticals. The Lado do Brasil company, specializing in the  sale and service of VAZ automobiles, has already settled in on  the Brazilian market. Plans for the purchase from Russia of  specialized fishing vessels and floating fish-processing plants  and a research ship for Brazilian research in Antarctica were  agreed in the course of the Moscow negotiations.    Russia has long been mulling over plans for an outlet onto  the Latin American arms market. Brazil could become a good  springboard for products of Russia's aerospace complex. The  Brazilian side expressed once again in Moscow an interest in the  joint development of inertial-guidance systems for space-launch  vehicles. At Brazil's suggestion, a plan of Russia's  participation in the creation of a global information system,  which with the aid of 66 satellites would link all countries of  the world, is being developed. Brazil's Alcantara Cosmodrome, in  the state of Maranhao, would be used for the launches of these  satellites, which would reduce the cost of the project  considerably: The geographical location of the cosmodrome would  permit a savings at the time of the launch of up to 30 percent  of the rocket fuel.    [Boxed item]    Enterprises That Participated in the Russian-Brazilian  Negotiations    --The Russian Finance Corporation --The Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Russia --The State  Investment Corporation --The Oboroneksport, Prodintorg, and  Obshchemasheksport all-Russia associations --The Agrarian  Technologies of Russia company --The Shipbuilders of St.  Petersburg joint-stock company --The Krylov Research Institute  --The Konversiya-Interservis Association --The Union of Aviation  Industry of Russia--Aviaprom and Myasishchev    [End box]    [Boxed item]    International Life Department Comment    The results of the Brazilian delegation's visit were yet  further confirmation of Moscow's interest in the assimilation of  the Latin American market. Russia is counting on the states of  the region (specifically, Brazil, which ranks among the ""new  industrial countries"") that are prepared to purchase not only  Russian raw materials but also its finished products. Russia  could to some extent tackle problems of conversion here also,  having obtained access to an ample arms and dual-purpose  technology market. It has thus far belonged practically  exclusively to the United States. And it is not fortuitous that  a Russian exposition will appear for the first time at a  close-combat arms exhibition in Uruguay in April-May 1994.    The first attempts to organize broad-based cooperation with  Brazil were made a year ago, when Moscow was visited by a  delegation of the FINEP major government investment corporation.  Even at that time (as now also), the Brazilians supported the  creation of joint ventures in the field of telecommunications  and displayed an interest in solid-fuel rocket engines. This  approach objectively corresponds to Russia's interests: The  relocation overseas, primarily in the ""new industrial  countries,"" of enterprises of the military-industrial complex  (in the form of joint ventures or affiliates) could to some  extent remove them from the heightened interest on the part of  Western competitors supporting strict control of Russian  research-intensive exports. But it remains an open question to  what extent it will be possible to avoid debate with the West  about which kind of technology Russia may export, and which,  not. And it cannot be ruled out that participation in the  reconstruction of Brazil's cosmodrome could, as in the case of  the infamous ""Indian deal,"" cause an outcry in Washington.     "

Vice-President Carlos Lage told a news conference in Havana at the weekend that the government was also preparing a new foreign investment law that would give more protection to overseas investors, who are already active in Cuba in activities ranging from oil exploration to citrus production. Cuba began opening up its state-run economy to external investment after 1989 to offset the devastating impact of the collapse of its preferential trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc. 'From now onwards, no productive sector will be excluded from investment by foreign capital,' Mr Lage said. Up to now, raw sugar production, traditionally the island's biggest export earner, had been explicitly closed to foreign investment. But the sugar industry is in deep crisis and has suffered two consecutive disastrously low harvests. Mr Lage also announced that, in defiance of a continuing US economic embargo against Cuba, representatives of more than 69 US companies had visited the island in the first half of this year to discuss business prospects. In some cases, letters of intent for future contracts had been negotiated to take effect when the US embargo was finally lifted by Washington. Representatives of two British sugar companies, Tate  Lyle, and EDF Man, have held talks this year with Cuban investment officials. Shortages of essential inputs previously supplied by the former Soviet Union, such as fuel, spare parts, fertilisers and herbicides, have crippled Cuba's sugar production since 1990. On Cuba's economy, Mr Lage said it was still too early to talk of recovery. But he cited some positive signs, such as the growth of foreign investment, particularly in tourism and oil exploration, improvements in construction, cement and nickel production and progress in the government's efforts to stabilise the country's internal finances.

Government sources think it unlikely that Argentine  interests  will end up operating installations on the islands themselves,  but believe Argentina's coast could be a logical site for  support operations.    Preliminary results from seismic surveys conducted last year  around the Falklands suggested the possibility of finding oil  across a zone 25 percent larger than the North Sea.    The disclosure of Britain's position follows a recent  request  from Buenos Aires for a meeting of senior foreign ministry  officials to discuss joint development of oil resources. London  has yet to agree to this meeting.    Reaching an oil accord with the UK is Argentina's next  important policy objective, but it is unlikely to accept terms  that implicitly recognise Britain's sovereignty over the  islands. Buenos Aires has used recent talks on fish to press  for a role in the development of possible oil and gas reserves.  British Gas said last year it had discussed joint offshore  exploration close to the disputed waters with YPF, Argentina's  state-owned oil company.    Some Falkland islanders are said to recognise that  rapprochement with Argentina would probably be necessary if an  oil industry were to be developed.    Recent developments come against a background of steadily  improving relations between the two former belligerents.    A year ago, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, became the  first UK cabinet minister to visit Argentina since the 1982  Falkland islands conflict.    Since then both Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy  minister, and Mr Guido Di Tella, foreign minister, have visited  Britain.     "

The area, in the watershed of the Tatshenshini River 60 km east of the Alaska panhandle, will be set aside for an 8.5m hectare wilderness park, straddling the US-Canada border. The government said yesterday that it will 'fairly' compensate Geddes Resources, which has so far spent CDollars 50m on exploration and development, and holders of other mineral claims in the area. Windy Craggy, widely thought to contain North America's richest undeveloped copper reserves, has become a focal point of the clash between resource industries and environmentalists. Development of the site, which is estimated to contain about 2.7m tonnes of copper, has been stalled for four years by environmental disputes. The chief executives of five Vancouver-based mining companies warned last week that a decision to turn the area into park land would have a negative impact on investor confidence in the province. Besides the rich metal content of the deposit, the mining industry has pointed to the job-creation potential of a new mine. Environmentalists on the other hand, have argued that a mine would do incalculable damage to rivers and wildlife in one of the most pristine parts of the continent. The Clinton administration has suggested creating a protected wildlife area straddling BC and Alaska. Royal Oak Mines of Vancouver this year bought a 39 per cent stake in Geddes, reasoning that its CDollars 10m (Pounds 5.3m) investment would be more than covered by compensation if the project was blocked.  -------------------------------------       LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------------        (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------- Aluminium   +8,400 to 1,877,325 Copper      +6,750 to   456,125 Lead           -50 to   258,925 Nickel      -2,130 to    88,362 Zinc        +2,950 to   680,625 Tin            -95 to    20,105  -------------------------------------   Companies:-  Geddes Resources.

0,FT911-1611 ,"FT911-1611 _AN-BECBBAFWFT 910503   FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Victoria woos mining companies      By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent   THE STATE of Victoria failed to reach its full potential during Australia's gold rush in the 1980s  - when the country's annual output jumped from 17 to about 200 tonnes  - mainly because of its reputation as a place to be avoided by mining and exploration companies. This was suggested yesterday by Mr Keith Bowen, general manager project facilitation for Victoria's Department of Manufacturing and Industry Development, who recalled that the state was Australia's leading gold producer in the late 1800s. Mr Bowen is part of a team in Europe trying to attract mining and down-stream processing companies to Victoria after its new Mining Act which comes into effect in July. The Act is completely new, not a revision or amendment, and has been designed 'to foster and encourage the mining industry', he said. Victoria's mineral production, including petroleum, coal and quarry products, last year was worth about ADollars 5bn. After these three items, gold was the most valuable, with output of 75,000 troy ounces worth ADollars 33m, followed by koalin, ADollars 13.4m; other clays ADollars 7.2m; and glass sand Dollars 3.9m. Mr Bowen said Victoria had one of the world's most economically important areas in the Latrobe Valley which contained about 4bn barrels of oil, 14 trillion cubic feet of gas and 30bn tonnes of readily winnable brown coal. The state currently produced no base metals in spite of being on the same geological formation from which metals were being mined in Tasmania and New South Wales. Victoria's low-cost energy made it an attractive location for energy-intensive mineral processing activities, such as the aluminium smelting at Point Henry and Portland. The state hoped to attract companies to upgrade mineral sands, to produce magnesium, to smelt nickel, fuse minerals and make specialised ceramic materials.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "
0,FT934-5307 ,"FT934-5307 _AN-DLACFAGOFT 931130   FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (8): Tapping into undeveloped reserves - Iain Simpson examines the government's plans to exploit its oil and gas fields      By IAIN SIMPSON   As its joint oil venture with the former Soviet Union lurches from one crisis to another, Vietnam is looking at ways of making more money out of its oil and gas reserves. The government's priority is to recover the gas now being flared off by VietSovPetro, the joint venture between Hanoi and Moscow. Plans to exploit gas from undeveloped fields are also being assessed and exploration contracts will soon be let on other areas. The Australian company, BHP Petroleum, has struck oil in the Dai Hung (Big Bear) field it is drilling off the south-east coast of Vietnam. BHP officials say their floating production system means the find can be exploited soon - certainly by the middle of 1994. BHP estimates recoverable reserves in the field at 7-800m barrels of oil. The company also says 2-3,000bn cubic feet of gas exists in Dai Hung. The gas from Dai Hung will not be piped out until well into next year but the state oil company, PetroVietnam, is pursuing ways of recovering gas from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field, the only Vietnamese field from which oil is now being pumped. Bach Ho was discovered by Mobil in January, 1975, but three months later the company was forced to abandon its drilling rigs and flee the country in the face of the advancing North Vietnamese troops. Two years later, Vietnam established its own state oil company, PetroVietnam. In 1981, the state company set up a joint venture with the Soviet Union, VietSovPetro and three years later the first oil was pumped out of Mobil's field. Since then, VietSovPetro has been draining the reserves at Bach Ho and flaring off the associated gas. It is producing 130,000 barrels a day. Critics in the oil industry say the Soviet technology is out of date and the oil reservoir is not being properly conserved by VietSovPetro. Indeed, PetroVietnam has just let two contracts - one for reservoir management and one for rig maintenance - to foreign companies. These tasks are normally carried out by the company drilling the wells. A proposal to recover gas from the Bach Ho field has also been put out to tender and British Gas, one of the companies bidding for the scheme, believes there is a large untapped market for gas in Vietnam. The project is split into two phases: under the 'fast track' phase one, an underwater pipeline will bring the gas onshore near the south-eastern port city of Vung Tau. Five foreign engineering companies have bid for this Dollars 100m-Dollars 150m contract and the tenders are to be examined by the middle of next month. Phase two involves an expansion of the pipeline capacity from phase one and the construction of an LPG plant. Industry sources say three foreign consortia have bid for this second phase of the project, worth Dollars 400m. At least one of these bids has been in since June and the bidders are pushing the government to make an early decision, saying that otherwise the reserves will continue to diminish as they are flared. Hanoi is also keen to discover and exploit other potential reservoirs of gas offshore and is seeking bids from companies to exploit gas reserves in offshore blocks which are now being drilled for oil. The gas pumped ashore by the phase one pipeline, which Hanoi hopes will be completed by the end of next year, will be used mainly to generate electricity at a power station near Vung Tau. Industry sources say the turbines, now powered by imported fuel oil, can easily be adapted to use natural gas. There is currently almost no domestic market for gas in Vietnam, except for a small onshore field in the north, used for electricity generation and piped to a ceramics factory. British Gas, which leads one of the consortia bidding for phase two, believes the higher volume of gas brought onshore can be used to develop a domestic market. A study carried out by the company 18 months ago concluded that in the short term, the Vietnamese market could absorb 2bn cubic metres a year. Phase two could bring between 1bn and 1.5bn cubic metres onshore annually and British Gas says it wants to promote the use of natural gas among industries in the south which now rely on electricity. Power is in short supply in the south, particularly in Ho Chi Minh City. However, the government is spending Dollars 500m on a north-south power line to carry excess electricity from north to south and may not welcome attempts by foreign companies to promote alternative sources of power. After a gap of 18 years, a team from Mobil is back in Vietnam, led by regional vice-president Bob Aberbach. The company has bid for a production-sharing contract on the Blue Dragon field, which will soon be awarded by the state oil and gas corporation. At the time of writing, the US trade embargo against Vietnam prevents American companies from doing most kinds of business in the country but, under the recently relaxed rules of the embargo, American oil companies can go a long way towards exploring potential fields. 'We can sign production-sharing contracts, carry out exploration drilling and appraisal drilling, which is the first stage in any production-sharing programme,' Mr Aberbach said.

The Austrian government was reported earlier this year to be considering a merger between OMV and the Verbund utility. But Mr Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer, OMV's chief financial officer, said yesterday it had become 'clear a merger was not realistic'. Instead, Austrian Industries, the state holding company, is to reduce the 72 per cent stake it has held in OMV since initial privatisation in 1987 to 30 per cent, and OMV will seek a foreign partner to take a 20 per cent stake. The proportion of shares in the public domain will be increased from 28 to 50 per cent through a private or public share placement. OMV is Austria's largest quoted industrial company, with a market capitalisation of Sch24bn (Dollars 2.43bn). Mr Ruttenstorfer said plans were at an early stage, but OMV was selecting an investment house to handle the proposed changes and hoped to start talking to potential partners by the end of the year. The changes in the ownership structure should be completed in 1993 or early 1994. He said OMV was seeking a partner which was a crude producer, in order to to secure access to greater oil supplies, and which would help OMV to implement its corporate strategy. That strategy includes increasing oil reserves through refocusing and higher spending on exploration and production activities, and strengthening OMV's position as an integrated energy company in central and eastern Europe. The company already has motor fuel marketing operations in the former Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, and is seeking a stake in a refinery in the Czech republic.

0,FT931-932 ,"FT931-932 _AN-DC1AGAAVFT 930327   FT  27 MAR 93 / An odd society battles on: David White finds Falkland Islanders an endangered species      By DAVID WHITE   MEASURED by the ratio of military to civilians, the Falkland Islands must have the most heavily defended population on earth. The colony's 2,200 inhabitants, almost all of British descent, barely outnumber the 2,000 UK airmen, soldiers and sailors posted there. Since the 1982 UK-Argentine conflict over the islands, an influx of new blood has reversed the population decline. But numbers have never been much greater than today and as a surge of prosperity based on squid fishery peters out, nothing short of an oil bonanza is likely to change that. The two communities live apart. Most servicemen are housed at Mount Pleasant, a new airfield complex built on a peat bog 35 miles from Stanley, the capital, along a road that (although the islands' best) is only partly tarmac. They are pretty self-sufficient. A sore point, under discussion with local authorities, is that mess kitchens use New Zealand lamb, in a territory whose treeless, wind-battered expanses serve little productive purpose except as grazing for 750,000 sheep. The meat comes by way of Britain, 8,400 miles away, in what is probably the longest voyage ever undertaken by a meat carcase. The thing is that the islands have no EC-standard abattoir and they say they cannot now afford one. Nevertheless, the armed forces are the islands' biggest cash customer, and the biggest tourism earner. They are warmly appreciated. Military flights, which anywhere else might be considered a nuisance, provide reassurance. 'We get complaints when people don't low-fly enough,' says Rear Admiral Neil Rankin, British forces commander. Islanders worry about the improving relations between London and Buenos Aires. The need to co-operate with Argentina, whether on fisheries or on future oil development, is a bitter pill to swallow. The scars from 1982 show no sign of healing. Argentine citizens are still banned. There are no transport connections. The main link to the outside world is the 18-hour, twice-weekly flight to the UK by RAF Tristar. The garrison, with a few Tornado fighters, heavy Hercules aircraft, helicopters and a frigate, is designed to hold the base until reinforcements arrive in a crisis. Running expenses are put at Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year, not counting the pay servicemen would get anyway, nor the cost of the RAF staging post on Ascension Island. In spite of the 'firm and unwavering commitment' pledged during a visit this week by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, the number of military personnel may be reduced. But the islanders' numbers could dwindle, too. Sixth-formers go to the UK; there may be less reason for them to come back. Prospects opened up after the war. Under a programme to bring land into local ownership, farm employee Mr Robin Marsh bought 20,000 acres in West Falkland, the smaller of the two main islands, with 5,000 sheep. But for the past three years, as world wool prices have plummeted, he has depended on support from the Falkland Islands government. This support may now stop. The government tapped unprecedented wealth from a licence regime set up in 1987 for vessels fishing within a 150-mile zone. The boats are mostly squid 'jiggers' from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and southern Europe. Government revenue, previously about Pounds 6m a year from wool tax receipts and UK grand aid, shot up to an unaided Pounds 40m. But last year Argentina launched a rival licence scheme, a move widely seen in the islands as deliberate economic pressure. Argentina is in a powerful position, since the young squid move south to the Falklands through its waters. It agreed with Britain last December to limit this season's number of licences. But the Falklands have slashed their estimate of licence earnings for the financial year just ending from Pounds 23m to Pounds 15m. Next year, government officials say, the planning figure is just Pounds 10m. At the islands' secretariat on Thatcher Drive, Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive, describes it as 'perhaps the greatest reduction in revenue that any country will experience short of having a war.' Public works, including the upgrading of tracks into something resembling proper roads, have run out of money. The good times have nonetheless left their imprint. A new hospital and school have been built. With a gradual migration from 'camp' - the country areas - residents say Stanley has become more bustling and urban. Japanese four-wheel drive vehicles can be spotted among the Land Rovers. Outlying settlements now have telephones and next month should receive television programmes. But where else do the armed forces provide the only television service? Sparseness, Englishness and remoteness make for an odd society. Darts matches and sheepdog trials are covered live on radio. The islands have no cash machine, no Indian restaurant, no illegal drugs and as yet no dole. There are as many species of penguin as pubs. What the islanders are waiting for is offshore oil. Successful exploration has been carried out in nearby Argentine waters. A seismic survey to the south is almost complete. Another has started to the north. Mr Sampson says even getting as far as exploration would bring a dramatic boost in population. Oil could transform the islands. But people are in two minds about the prospect. They value their unspoilt lifestyle. Says Mr Sampson: 'The most endangered species here would be Falkland Islanders.'   Countries:-  FKZ  Falkland Islands.

The words ""soft adventure"" and ""ecotourism"" are new to the vocabulary of  travel, being freely used in promotional material even though their meaning  isn't always clear.    Soft adventure is a less strenuous form of adventure travel, with varying  parameters. Ecotourism involves travel that relates to environmental/ecological  issues.    ""The two terms aren't necessarily related, though soft adventure travel can be  part of an ecotourism trip,"" said Leslie Jarvie, director of environmental  programs for Sobek Expeditions in Angels Camp, Calif.    ""Ecotourism travel is designed to educate people on specific subjects and  areas, and we use soft adventure experiences as a form of activism to heighten  the awareness of people on the areas visited.""    Soft adventure can mean such travel experiences as staying with primitive  tribes in northern Thailand, observing sea turtles on Costa Rican beaches,  scouting polar bears in northern Canada and sailing to Antarctica or the  less-visited South Pacific islands.    One may hike, bike, white-water raft or simply watch wildlife, all the while  staying in hotels and camps with special amenities.    ""Soft adventure is really striking a balance between hard adventure and more  traditional packages,"" said Dyanne Durgar of Seattle-based Imagine Travel  Alternatives, a firm offering soft adventure programs to such countries as  Costa Rica and Belize.    A similar definition came from Charles Kao, vice president of Santa  Monica-based Speed Travel, which offers soft-adventure packages to Southeast  Asia.    ""Soft-adventure trips can be for anyone who likes the outdoors or who wants to  see rural life, and not just the familiar big-city destinations, and is in good  health,"" Kao said. ""One doesn't need an experience or background in the  particular activity.""    Some soft-adventure trips also can combine the usual big cities with more  off-beat destinations.    Doing without some comforts, though, is often a characteristic of this type of  travel. And the degree of exertion needed to participate is another key issue  that travelers should resolve before buying such a package.    ""Travelers should ask such questions as how much walking or climbing is  necessary,"" Durgar said. ""While accommodations are clean and comfortable, they  also tend to be smaller and without all the services of large hotels. So  travelers should also ask if they will have private baths and if there will be  hot water. Some places might not always have hot water.""    Also, travelers may have to share rooms. ""We match people and discourage single  occupancy,"" Durgar said. ""There isn't even a single-supplement option in our  program.""    Although people may want to explore on their own, travelers should understand  that they may have to eat and take part in activities on a group basis, Durgar  said.    An example of pace comes from San Diego-based Baja Expeditions, which offers  such programs as mountain bike touring and sea kayaking in Baja, as well as Sea  of Cortez cruises.    ""Our literature explains that these mountain bike tours cover 20 to 25 miles a  day at a comfortable pace,"" said Kent Madin, the company's general manager.    ""The tours are geared for both experienced mountain bikers and beginners. More  experienced bikers can cover more miles, which is usually by riding ahead or  going off the main road and exploring on their own.""    Other questions to ask about such trips are if there are support vehicles, if  there is a base camp and how far from it participants wander each day?    ""Travelers should ask what happens if they get tired or want to bail out for  some reason and just be a couch potato for the rest of the trip,"" Madin said.  ""We always provide an escape hatch where people can quit if they want.""    Baja Expeditions includes a passenger van that accompanies the cyclists, as  well a four-wheel-drive truck to carry equipment.    Travelers should also understand that companies select pictures for their  brochures that dramatize and enhance their offerings. ""However, the animals and  weather don't always perform on cue,"" Madin said. ""We can't control  environmental factors, and you can't always pat a gray whale. The idea of  adventure is to be open-minded and not have a preconceived notion of what is  supposed to happen.""    The types of travelers going in for soft adventure also is changing, according  to Scott Fasken, owner and operator of Idaho Float, which runs outdoor vacation  programs.    ""We get many more families now,"" Fasken said. ""This kind of experience isn't  seen as just a macho activity for beer-drinking buddies. Food is still a major  misconception, with people thinking they'll just get beans, franks and  hamburgers, whereas we serve a lot fancier food, including steaks, chicken,  fresh salads and fruits.""    The level of comfort is also underrated, Fasken said. ""While our clients sleep  in tents, they have large air mattresses that are self-inflating. We also carry  along dining tables and lawn chairs for dining and cocktails. This isn't  camping out Boy Scout-style.""    The subject of ecotourism can also be misunderstood, according to Durbar. ""This  is a pat expression, so we don't use it. What it means is an emphasis on  travelers being especially respectful of an area and as unobtrusive as  possible. Travelers should ask those who use the term how they're backing up  the concept. Is anything concrete being done?""    Questions to ask for ecotourism trips are: What special training do the guides  have? Will any specialists or authorities on the subject or area accompany the  group during the experience?    To show support for the concept of ecotourism, Durbar said her firm donates 1%  of gross revenues for each tour to such organizations as the Costa Rica  Conservation League and the Belize Audubon Society.    Baja Expeditions provides aid to research in Baja California and the Sea of  Cortez through complimentary shuttle service and equipment to  research/conservation teams in the area, and co-sponsoring conferences on Baja  subjects.    Sobek Expeditions has begun a policy this year of structuring tax-deductible  donations to the Rainforest Action Network, a nonprofit organization working to  save the world's rain forests, for five of its ecotourism packages covering  rain forests in Brazil, Indonesia, Nepal, Costa Rica and Rwanda.    ""Clients will be donating $250 to $400, depending on the trip,"" Jarvie said.

""We match people and discourage single  occupancy,"" Durgar said. ""There isn't even a single-supplement option in our  program.""    Although people may want to explore on their own, travelers should understand  that they may have to eat and take part in activities on a group basis, Durgar  said.    An example of pace comes from San Diego-based Baja Expeditions, which offers  such programs as mountain bike touring and sea kayaking in Baja, as well as Sea  of Cortez cruises.    ""Our literature explains that these mountain bike tours cover 20 to 25 miles a  day at a comfortable pace,"" said Kent Madin, the company's general manager.    ""The tours are geared for both experienced mountain bikers and beginners. More  experienced bikers can cover more miles, which is usually by riding ahead or  going off the main road and exploring on their own.""    Other questions to ask about such trips are if there are support vehicles, if  there is a base camp and how far from it participants wander each day?    ""Travelers should ask what happens if they get tired or want to bail out for  some reason and just be a couch potato for the rest of the trip,"" Madin said.  ""We always provide an escape hatch where people can quit if they want.""    Baja Expeditions includes a passenger van that accompanies the cyclists, as  well a four-wheel-drive truck to carry equipment.    Travelers should also understand that companies select pictures for their  brochures that dramatize and enhance their offerings. ""However, the animals and  weather don't always perform on cue,"" Madin said. ""We can't control  environmental factors, and you can't always pat a gray whale. The idea of  adventure is to be open-minded and not have a preconceived notion of what is  supposed to happen.""    The types of travelers going in for soft adventure also is changing, according  to Scott Fasken, owner and operator of Idaho Float, which runs outdoor vacation  programs.    ""We get many more families now,"" Fasken said. ""This kind of experience isn't  seen as just a macho activity for beer-drinking buddies. Food is still a major  misconception, with people thinking they'll just get beans, franks and  hamburgers, whereas we serve a lot fancier food, including steaks, chicken,  fresh salads and fruits.""    The level of comfort is also underrated, Fasken said. ""While our clients sleep  in tents, they have large air mattresses that are self-inflating. We also carry  along dining tables and lawn chairs for dining and cocktails. This isn't  camping out Boy Scout-style.""    The subject of ecotourism can also be misunderstood, according to Durbar. ""This  is a pat expression, so we don't use it. What it means is an emphasis on  travelers being especially respectful of an area and as unobtrusive as  possible. Travelers should ask those who use the term how they're backing up  the concept. Is anything concrete being done?""    Questions to ask for ecotourism trips are: What special training do the guides  have? Will any specialists or authorities on the subject or area accompany the  group during the experience?    To show support for the concept of ecotourism, Durbar said her firm donates 1%  of gross revenues for each tour to such organizations as the Costa Rica  Conservation League and the Belize Audubon Society.    Baja Expeditions provides aid to research in Baja California and the Sea of  Cortez through complimentary shuttle service and equipment to  research/conservation teams in the area, and co-sponsoring conferences on Baja  subjects.    Sobek Expeditions has begun a policy this year of structuring tax-deductible  donations to the Rainforest Action Network, a nonprofit organization working to  save the world's rain forests, for five of its ecotourism packages covering  rain forests in Brazil, Indonesia, Nepal, Costa Rica and Rwanda.    ""Clients will be donating $250 to $400, depending on the trip,"" Jarvie said.

The six-month permit allows Alcorn (Production) Philippines  Inc. to conduct ""research and library work"" on aeromagnetic  surveys and other data already held by the department, its oil  and gas division chief, Ismael Ocampo, said.    The permit covers the Kalayaan group of eight islands and  reefs currently garrisoned by Philippine troops.    Ocampo told AFP the permit, the first to be granted by  Manila  in the area, was ""sensitive"" due to conflicting territorial  claims on the strategic South China Sea chain by Brunei, China,  Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.    Because of the territorial conflict, any eventual drilling  to  be permitted by Manila would have to be in a ""joint venture with  China and Vietnam,"" he said, adding that no other Philippine oil  exploration firm has applied for permit in the Kalayaan area.    An Alcorn official, Ponciano Mathay, told AFP his company  has  applied for a permit to conduct research on the Kalayaan area,  but insisted the energy department had yet to approve it.    He said the permit would not require Alcorn to conduct  actual  drilling.    Two US firms, Crestone Energy and Mobil, are exploring for  oil in disputed areas in the South China Sea, with Crestone  enjoying the protection of the Chinese navy. Mobil obtained its  permit from Vietnam.    Alcorn is the operator of the West Linapacan offshore  production site off the western island of Palawan, the only  wells in commercial production in the Philippines.    Water intrusion has drastically reduced production to about  3,500 barrels per day from 15,000 bpd last year, but the  consortium plans to boost output to about 6,000 bpd following  the drilling of a sidetrack well last month.

Mr Emmanuel Agbodo, the head of Ghana's privatisation programme, said the government was calling for bids from interested mining companies. Ashanti Goldfields, he said, was 'conservatively' valued at Dollars 500m. The company produced 654,293 ounces of gold in the 1991-92 fiscal year, which ended in September. The target for the present fiscal year is 744,345 ounces. At present the government of Ghana owns 55 per cent of Ashanti Goldfields. Lonrho, with 45 per cent, also has the management contract for the mines. Mr Agbodo said the government planned to reduce its shareholding to about 35 per cent. The new partners would be required to accept Lonrho's operational control of the mines. The sale, which will be Ghana's biggest sell-off exercise to date, is being handled by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation. The projected Dollars 100m windfall has already been included in the government's 1993 budget. Without this pivotal source of income, the government risks derailing its carefully balanced budget - the cornerstone of World Bank-approved economic reforms. But Mr Agbodo conceded that the timing of the sale might not be to Ghana's advantage, as mining multinationals are unlikely to rush an investment decision of such magnitude. The proposed sell-off, however, underscores Ghana's commitment to pursuing one of the few privatisation programmes on the African continent. Mr Agbodo also confirmed that a Guernsey subsidiary of Gold Fields of South Africa had acquired a controlling stake of the government-owned Tarkwa underground gold mine for Dollars 2m. Tarkwa, in Ghana's western region, still has large reserves of low-grade ore, but has conducted virtually no exploration work in recent years. Gold Fields of South Africa is also looking into the possibility of purchasing the neighbouring Prestea gold deposits for a similar sum.   Companies:-  Ashanti Goldfields Corp.

The Ernest Henry deposit was discovered in 1991 by a joint venture between Western Mining Corporation and Hunter Resources on a group of six leases owned by Savage Resources, a small coal and exploration company. The deposit has indicated reserves of 69m tonnes of mineralisation at an average grade of 1.6 per cent of copper and 0.8 grammes per tonne of gold. However, its ownership is disputed between Savage Resources and the joint venture partners. MIM announced earlier this month that it had agreed to buy Hunter Resources' 30 per cent interest in the Ernest Henry deposit and the adjacent Mount Fort Constantine area in the event that the Queensland courts ruled against Savage. Under the second deal, announced yesterday, MIM would acquire 51 per cent of the deposit for ADollars 92.5m (Pounds 43.5m) if the courts ruled in favour of Savage Resources, or ADollars 14m for Savage's royalty rights if WMC and Hunter Resources are awarded ownership. Alternatively, the agreement provides for a range of royalty and equity transfers to MIM if the dispute between Savage and the joint venturers is settled out of court. Mr Norm Fussell, MIM's managing director, said that the group wanted to secure a substantial position in Ernest Henry as part of its basic strategic objective of expanding copper production, especially in its north-west Queensland base. The Ernest Henry deposit and the highly-prospective Mount Fort Constantine area are close to MIM's Mount Isa base, where the group has extensive mining and copper smelting facilities. In a separate announcement, MIM said that it would acquire the 13.5 per cent of the Oaky Creek export coking coal join venture that it does not already own from Hoogovens Delfstoffen of The Netherlands and Empresa Nacional Siderurgica of Spain.

CNOOC Spokesman Chen Bingqian said at a press conference  today that the ""Wan'an Bei-21"" contract, signed in 1992 by CNOOC  and the U.S. Crestone Energy Corporation, over which Vietnam's  claim was made, is ""legally binding.""    He said the contract block, located in the Nansha [Spratly]  offshore area, falls within China's jurisdiction. ""CNOOC and  Crestone have the right to undertake normal operations in this  area,"" he stated.    On April 25 a Vietnamese press release claimed Crestone and  CNOOC had ""violated"" the sovereign rights of Vietnam by signing  the contract for ""Wan'an Bei-21"" oil exploration.    It further demanded the termination of the contract and  cancellation of all related activities.    ""Our company will absolutely not accept the accusation, as  well as the unreasonable demands,"" Chen said.    The ""Wan'an Bei-21"" contract covers an area of more than  25,000 square kilometers in the South China Sea. The  undersigner should be responsible for laying seismic lines and  drilling exploratory wells during the contractual period of  seven years.    ""It must be pointed out that recently Vietnam Oil and Gas  Corporation has set aside a batch of blocks of the Nansha  islands for bids from foreign companies, and some foreign  companies have entered into contracts for oil and gas  exploration and exploitation, which constitute violations of  China's sovereignty over the Nansha offshore area and also  infringes on our company's interests,"" Chen warned.    ""It is known to all that the Chinese Government has  repeatedly called for shelving the disputes and participating in  joint development before a solution to the Nansha issue can be  reached,"" he said.

It is a spirit epitomised in the movies by Rocky Balboa, the washed-up palooka who made the most of his last big shot to be somebody. In real life, there is no finer example than the impressive turnround by Sun Company, one of the stalwarts of Philadelphia's old industrial base. In 1991, the 108-year-old energy group - the fourth biggest company in the region - was a flabby under-achiever weighed down by a bloated portfolio of peripheral businesses. Overall, its operations were producing a meagre 2 per cent return on equity. Just two years later, the company is showing a return on equity of 10 per cent, having transformed itself into a lean contender with good prospects of sustained growth. 'They have identified where they have the best chance to be profitable,' says Mr George Baker, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. 'In doing so, they have gone a long way towards making the company a more focused enterprise.' Sun has gone a long way in setting itself apart from its rivals, too. More than any other big energy group, it has emphasised a commitment to safe and sustainable environmental practices. It was the first Fortune 500 company to endorse the principles of the Coalition of Environmentally Responsible Economies, a non-profit organisation set up after the Exxon Valdez oil-spill to promote green business policies. On a smaller scale, Sun has put a human face on its corporate image with several innovative programmes, including an offer to buy and junk worn-out cars which are heavy polluters. In a small step which may symbolise the fresh approach, its headquarters was brought back to downtown Market Street after 23 years' exile in the suburb of Radnor. Nostalgia, however, had less to do with the relocation than did a desire to cut costs. The move was part of a comprehensive streamlining implemented soon after Mr Robert Campbell took over as chairman and chief executive in 1992. Under the new regime, the company has shifted its focus back to its traditional strengths - refining and marketing in the north-east. In its core operating region, Sun commands 14 per cent of the retail petrol trade, the second largest share behind Mobil. Branded petrol accounts for 37 per cent of total sales, by far the company's most important revenue generator. Sun hopes to build on these strengths. Concurrently, the group has withdrawn from the areas where it was taking a beating. It finally threw in the towel on most of its international exploration operations, after spinning off its US exploration and production in 1988. 'In drilling for oil and gas, we had a horrible record,' admits Mr Robert Aiken, chief financial officer. The company is still involved in international crude production, which remains profitable. Coal mining and real estate were deemed losing propositions, too. In Sun's continuing operations, expenses were slashed and the workforce reduced by 20 per cent to 14,000. So far, the results have exceeded Mr Campbell's goals. Sun posted operating profit of Dollars 193m last year, against Dollars 30m ayear earlier. The figure is well ahead of his target of achieving a Dollars 150m improvement. The company was again able to tap operating income in paying its dividend, another of the chairman's ambitions. Analysts are divided about some of the company's specific moves, and point out that its recovery is part of cyclical upturn by the industry as a whole. But most agree that the overall strategy is sound. Sun wins plaudits for securing long-term leases to operate filling stations along the Pennsylvania turnpike. The company also gained exclusive rights to sell petrol along the New Jersey turnpike, perhaps the most travelled highway in America. The high visibility of operating along such motorways carries benefits that exceed the revenues they directly generate, analysts say. Meanwhile, filling stations in the mid-west have been sold; underperforming outlets in the north-east have been pared from its 3,000-strong network. A move to integrate its branded petrol offerings under a single banner - Sunoco  - is also expected to pay off in higher margins, a critical factor in petrol retailing, where demand at best grows a scant 1 per cent a year. The group also put a feather in its cap by agreeing to buy a Chevron refining plant located on property adjacent to its main Philadelphia facility. The bargain-basement price of Dollars 170m made the deal an easy sell, even though the potential environmental remediation costs which Sun may face have yet to be quantified, says Mr John Hilton, an analyst at Argus Research in New York. 'Such investments are usually just shots in the dark,' says Mr James Murchie, who follows the industry for Sanford C Berstein in New York. He argues that future demand and margins on refined products are nearly impossible to gauge. Refining, a costly necessity for a marketer of petroleum products, continues to be a drag on Sun's bottom line, accounting for Dollars 80m in operating losses last year. Still, the Chevron acquisition was a safe bet, says Mr Murchie. Indeed, if the deal had been completed before this winter's deep freeze, which brought a sharp increase in demand for heating oil, the investment would have already paid for itself.

The assets for sale include a 58 per cent interest in the Cadjebut mine. Western Metals is a privately-owned company, in which Ausgold holds a 13 per cent stake. Ausgold, which asked for its shares to be suspended yesterday, said it had made an offer to acquire the remaining 87 per cent of Western Metals. It said it planned to raise ADollars 30m (USDollars 21.7m), via an underwritten public share offering, to fund the Cadjebut deal and the development of other assets included in the BHP transaction. The interests involved include BHP's stake in the Cadjebut zinc/lead mine, which was developed in 1987 and has about another 18 months of life. Total production at Cadjebut last year was 102,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 29,000 tonnes of lead concentrate. Also included in the package are undeveloped ore bodies at Blendevale, Twelve Mile Bore and Kapok, and interests in a number of joint ventures in the region. Ausgold said it hoped 'to bring on stream the development of the next ore body, 12 Mile Bore, before the existing reserves at Cadjebut are depleted'. BHP, which did not disclose the sale price, said the assets involved in the transaction no longer 'fitted our profile'. BHP's partner in the Cadjebut mine, with the remaining 42 per cent interest, is Shell Australia. The interest forms part of Shell's Australian metals portfolio, which the oil company has talked of floating on the stock market.

0,FT942-5664 ,"FT942-5664 _AN-EFCDVAC8FT 940603   FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology: Knowledge is power - Knova is an analytical tool that aspires to making the intangibles tangible      By DIANE PALFRAMAN   For most companies, improving business performance means reorganising to cut costs and jobs, followed by further investment in computers and communications technology. Few have considered the impact of intangibles such as knowledge on performance. Knowledge is a resource that is difficult to assess and manage. But now researchers at Cambridge University, working with British Petroleum, have developed a method for analysing the factors influencing knowledge. It allows an appropriate investment plan to be developed and, ultimately, the investment to be related to performance. BP initiated the work after making substantial organisational changes in the late 1980s. It wanted to improve the way people worked in a flatter, more team-oriented structure; but it also recognised that the usual information-based approach was too narrow and that 'soft' factors  - such as knowledge - must be taken into account. 'Common sense tells you that knowledge will influence the way people work, but we wanted to know how it affected them,' explains Paul Wilhelmij, BP International's team leader in decision support, who with his colleague, Jack Betteridge, provided a business focus for the work with Cambridge University. The partnership produced an analysis technique called Knova (Knowledge value-added). This provides 'a holistic business view to identify the less obvious cost drivers,' says Tony Holden, head of the university's decision support group, which collaborated in developing the method. Knova resulted in a computer model that takes into account the relationships  -in a team or organisation - between knowledge, people, performance, investment, culture and benefits. People factors include staff turnover and motivation, while culture factors include leadership, openness, informal and formal communications, the working environment, geographic distribution and personal reward. According to Holden, traditional management models have difficulty linking these 'soft' issues with 'hard' quantitative factors, such as costs and investment. Nor can they easily analyse the benefits of investing in the knowledge resource. In addition, Knova can provide both a static and a dynamic view of the factors that influence knowledge. By assigning order-of-magnitude values to the influencing factors and using system dynamic modelling software, a computer model can be produced. This model can then be used to track the factors over a period of time and perform 'what-if' analyses to compare different investment options. Knowledge investments cover, for example, new procedures, computer systems, communications, external consultancy and training. Holden points out that the computer model is only quasi-quantitative because of the subjective nature of such factors as culture, but insists: 'Knova facilitates a much richer representation, that can be linked to pictures, text and numbers, than the traditional paper-based representation of influencing factors.' Companies do realise that knowledge is important, says Holden. It is expertise, know-how, information and data that employees use to make decisions. In the recent restructuring, some companies have tried to use knowledge more effectively by introducing team-working and giving people more responsibility. But freedom to apply and share knowledge will not necessarily improve performance. Nor will an increase in the training budget. Knowledge must be developed and managed to produce beneficial results, argues Holden. The development of Knova began at the end of the 1980s and its practical relevance was tested in the early 1990s on projects within the exploration arm of BP. One application, that looked at human factors in team-working, involved an awareness campaign to overcome a common problem in oil exploration - when a drilling pipe gets stuck. At BP Exploration, the cost of this problem had risen sharply in the late 1980s, from around Dollars 32m (Pounds 21.5m) a year to nearly Dollars 40m in 1988. BP Exploration knew that poor communications was a leading factor in the problem. It developed a training programme to encourage open communication, knowledge-sharing and problem-solving among its drilling teams. It trained 800 people, 70 per cent of whom were from outside contractors. In two years, BP Exploration cut its drilling costs to Dollars 13m, but in 1991 costs began to rise again at two sites. This was put down to changes in personnel and a push for higher performance. Applying Knova to the problem (albeit after the fact) showed that Knova would have predicted the cost trends and would have highlighted staff turnover as a potential factor. Having validated the technique, both BP and the Cambridge group are applying it to other problems. BP is using it to look at operational decision-making on its process plants. 'We are trying to create the right kind of environment for people who are working together in teams on our plants,' says Wilhelmij. This would improve decision-making and could affect plant safety. At Cambridge University, the decision support group is currently using Knova to identify the influences on performance in service departments of large organisations, such as the UK's National Health Service hospitals. But the group's main target industries are manufacturing, in particular oil and petrochemicals, and financial services. These sectors have gone through big changes, and want to maximise performance and minimise risks. One way to do this, argues Holden, is by ensuring that people make quality decisions - decision-making being a knowledge-based activity. 'To get quality decisions, you may not need more sophisticated computer systems but a better organisational environment in which managers can make them,' says Holden. 'Investing in computer technology has become a knee-jerk reaction and although computers have a place companies must broaden their perspective. Companies must also consider the intangibles and our work is to make the intangibles tangible.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P7372 Prepackaged Software.

Remarkable increases have been seen in both the amount and  the number of projects involving state investment in the  northwestern provinces of Gansu, Qinghai and Shaanxi and the  Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions.    So far, half of the fund for economic development of these  regions has come from state investment, which focuses on the  exploration and exploitation of coal and oil resources,  establishment of large state-owned enterprises and  infrastructure construction.    The five interior provinces and autonomous regions in  northwest China occupy one-third of the country's total  landspace. Among the 160 kinds of minerals found in China, 120  have been sited there.

The plentiful natural gas of Shaanxi, the oil reserves of  Xinjiang, coal resources in Ningxia and the rich water power  resources of the Yellow River that winds through the region are  all of vital significance to the country's economic development.    Despite the area's rich natural resources, northwest China's  economic development has long lagged behind that of other parts  of the country for geographical and historical reasons.    Promotion of the local economy and exploitation of natural  resources has become an urgent need for the country. In China's  eighth five-year-plan, priority has been given to the  development of the transportation and electrical power  industries and the tapping of resources in northwest China.    Increased state investment has been rewarded with extensive  growth seen in electricity supplies, transporting capacity and  output of petroleum in the northwest region, which is expected  to become the country's number one energy supplier in the near  future.

He was speaking following today's decision by the Medical  Research Council (MRC) and the US National Institutes of Health  (NIH) to withdraw their patent applications for cDNA sequences  of unknown function, filed in 1991.    Mr Waldegrave said:    ""The MRC and NIH patent applications were filed in order to  protect the interests of the UK and US taxpayers, with least  damage to the international research effort in genome mapping  which requires the free flow of information.    ""However, The Medical Research Council, with the support of  the Government, has always argued that these applications should  not be granted. I welcome the co-operation between the UK and  the US on this important issue and look forward to further  developments in this important area of research.""    This announcement backs up MRC's decision in October 1993  not  to file any further patent application on newly-obtained cDNA  sequences of unknown function unless accompanied by knowledge of  the gene function.    Sir Dai Rees, Secretary to the MRC said:    ""We feel this withdrawal of the patents is a correct step,  and we are delighted to be able to co-ordinate our actions with  those of the NIH.""

For  example, the images of cloud patterns over and around Japan,  which are sent by the meteorological satellite ""Himawari,"" are  shown on television every day. The number of households  subscribing to satellite broadcasting service exceeds 4 million.  In addition, we are communicating with people in foreign  countries using the international telephone service offered via  communications satellites. In recent years, the use of the  global positioning system (GPS) satellite launched by the United  States is expanding from use on ships to use in cars, as well as  to portable use by individuals.    The space industry has been promoting the use of the space  technology that makes it possible to offer these services. The  industry comprises the space hardware production industry which  manufactures satellites and rockets, etc.; the space utilization  industry which offers broadcasting, communications,  meteorological and earth observation services; and the  space-related service industry which offers various services,  including database services using satellites. As their markets  continue to expand, these industries are beginning to experience  increased competition on the international market. Under these  circumstances, the Japanese space industry is experiencing a  turning point that is expected to continue up to around the year  2000.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has  been promoting a number of programs aimed at encouraging the use  of space technology and services in Japan. These programs have  been promoted through increased cooperation with the  organizations devoted to promoting the use of space technology  and other space-related establishments in foreign countries. In  promoting these programs, the ministry took into consideration  the recent progress being made in global information exchange  services and the urgency of tackling the problem of the earth's  deteriorating environment.    Figure 1 [not reproduced] outlines the current system in  Japan aimed at promoting space development and the use of space  technology. Table 1 explains the contents of MITI's budgets for  space development in FY91 and 92. This paper will outline MITI's  policy for promoting domestic space industry.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Promotion of Utilization of Satellite-Based Remote Sensing  Technology    Remote sensing technology, which involves earth observation  from satellites, is one space technology in which the demand for  the technology is expected to increase for applications not only  involving meteorological observation, but also for natural  resource exploration, environmental observation and geographical  survey. Japan has launched a series of meteorological satellites  (GMS: Himawari) and a series of marine observation satellites  (MOS-1a and MOS-1b) to conduct space research and development  and to promote the use of space satellites. In February 1992,  Japan launched a natural resource exploration satellite (JERS-1)  that went into commercial operation that September. Japan has  exchanged memorandums for the joint operation of the satellite  with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of  the United States and the European Space Agency (ESA). In  November 1992, data received from the satellite was initially  supplied to researchers for AO verification. Talks are currently  under way between MITI and the National Space Development Agency  of Japan (NASDA) to make the data available to other customers.  In the meantime, there are plans to launch advanced earth  observation satellites (ADEOS-I and ADEOS-II) and a tropical  rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) satellite. There is also a  plan to participate in an international satellite launching  program in which Japan will provide the sensing equipment for  earth observation to be launched aboard a foreign-made  satellite. To strengthen the efforts toward natural resource  exploration and the observation of the natural environment to  grasp the effects industrial activities have on the environment,  MITI has been promoting the development of an optical sensor  (OPS) and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to be launched by the  JERS-1 satellite, the development of a  greenhouse-effect-causing-gas sensor (IMG) to be launched by the  ADEOS satellite, and the development of an advanced visible  light/infrared radiation sensor (ASTER) to be launched by NASA's  earth observation satellite (EOS-AM1). In addition, the ministry  is promoting the development of a next-generation synthetic  aperture radar (next-generation SAR) and a next-generation  greenhouse effect-causing gas sensor (next-generation IMG). At  the same time, the ministry is promoting the development of the  technology for the processing, analysis and utilization of the  data obtained from these satellites and sensors, and is  improving the system for distributing this data. Efforts are  also being made to construct a database of satellite observation  data and to construct a database network.    1. Development of Earth Resource Exploration Satellite  No 1 (JERS-1) JERS-1 is a satellite that was launched in  February 1992 for natural resource exploration using remote  sensing technology. The satellite was developed through joint  cooperation between MITI and NASDA. MITI has overseen the  development of the observation system, including the optical  observation sensor and synthetic aperture radar. The actual  development work has been commissioned to the Organization for  the Development of Natural Resource Exploration Systems (JAROS).  The development effort is now passing from the test operation  stage to commercial operation.    The JERS-1 satellite, equipped with synthetic aperture  radar,  is capable of performing multi-dimensional observation and of  conducting observation in short-wavelength infrared frequency  bands. The satellite is superior to those launched by the United  States and European countries, including LANDSAT and SPOT.  JERS-1 has drawn high expectations from researchers around the  world for its capabilities in natural resource exploration and  earth environment monitoring. Efforts are currently being made  by the Earth Resource Survey and Data Analysis Center (ERSDAC),  an extragovernmental organization affiliated with MITI, and  NASDA to improve the system to process, analyze and distribute  the data obtained from the satellite.    The data from the satellite is being received through the  cooperation of ground stations in the United States, Canada,  Australia and Europe. By receiving data from a European earth  resource survey satellite (EERS-1) for the ESA, Japan has  entered into a mutual cooperation agreement regarding satellite  data reception with those European countries. The European  satellite was launched in July 1991. A memorandum was exchanged  between ERSDAC and King Abdul Aziz City of Science and  Technology (KACST) of Saudi Arabia for the joint reception of  JERS-1 data and joint research between them. Research is  currently under way.    With the operation of the JERS-1 satellite, this joint  research is expected to produce useful results.    2. Development of Advanced Visible Light/Infrared  Radiation Sensor (ASTER)    ASTER is an optical observation sensor that is being  developed for a future launch aboard the JERS-1 satellite. A  similar sensor is scheduled to be launched in 1998 aboard the  U.S. satellite EOS-AM1 for earth observation. This satellite is  being developed by NASA. ASTER is currently under development by  JAROS, with the development commissioned to the establishment by  MITI. This sensor is an advanced version of the observation  sensor currently being used on the JERS-1 satellite. ASTER will  make it possible to conduct observation in multi-band  frequencies in the thermo-infrared frequency range for the first  time ever. This sensor is expected to be used in diverse  application fields, including natural resource exploration and  earth environment observation. In the United States, too, the  need to develop a sensor similar to ASTER has been voiced. The  fact that ASTER has been picked by NASA for launching aboard the  American satellite means that the Japanese sensor technology has  reached international standards. Considering that the sensor  will play an important role in the earth observation system  (EOS) project being promoted by NASA with cooperation from  Japan, Canada and European countries, the sensor has been  drawing great international attention. This has prompted the  formation of research teams not only in Japan, but also in the  United States with assistance from NASA, for developing  application fields for ASTER. MITI intends to promote the  development of the application fields through cooperation with  foreign researchers, including those from the United States and  Europe.    3. Survey of Earth's Environment Using  Satellite-Mounted Sensor (Wide-Area Environment Monitoring and  Surveying)    In recent years, the deterioration of the earth's  environment  has grown into a major international issue. The prime target of  the efforts to combat environmental pollution has been to  restrain the levels of substances in the environment which are  responsible for causing the so-called greenhouse effect. These  substances include CO[.sup]2[/] and methane. It is not yet  known in which part of the earth's environment these substances  are concentrated and in what density. The effort to monitor and  survey the earth's environment over a wide area will involve  earth observation using a satellite-mounted sensor (IMG) that is  capable of detecting these greenhouse effect-causing substances.  The earth observation satellite ADEOS is scheduled to be  launched by NASDA in 1995. The development of the sensor is  being conducted by JAROS, the construction of the ground system  for receiving IMG data is being conducted by ERSDAC, and the  development of data analysis technology has been undertaken by  the Central Research Institute of the Electric Power Industry.  All of these projects have been commissioned to these  establishments by MITI. The sensor is designed to measure the  distribution of these substances in vertical and horizontal  directions in the environment by detecting special types of  light in infrared wavelength ranges which are emitted by these  substances. This is the first time that an attempt to observe  the earth's environment using this method has been made, and  thus great attention is being paid by environmental specialists  around the world.    4. Development of Utilization Technology in Field of  Natural Resource Exploration    In the search for natural resources, including oil deposits,  it is important to comprehend the geological structure of a  particular region on the earth. The effort toward grasping the  structure combines the surveying of the earth's surface features  and boring. Until recent years, surveying was conducted by  dispatching specialists to a designated region and having them  conduct their tasks using exploration instruments. Recently,  aerial exploration using aircraft has begun to be conducted to  improve efficiency, enabling a larger area to be explored at one  time. Exploration from a satellite in space makes it possible to  cover an even greater area by scanning the earth's surface at  regular intervals. This new method has raised expectations among  those involved in such exploration.    MITI has been making an effort to make it possible to use  the  observation data obtained from LANDSAT and SPOT in the  exploration of natural resources, including exploration for oil  deposits. The development of the technology needed to promote  this effort has been conducted by ERSDAC as part of a  development task commissioned by MITI. So far, efforts have been  made to verify the effectiveness of the remote sensing  technology in exploring natural resource deposits by comparing  the data obtained by these remote sensing satellites with the  data obtained through ground exploration. In addition, the  development of the technology to improve the data processing and  analyzing techniques has been promoted to ensure the effective  use of the data. The use of the remote-sensed data has already  been started in the exploration of oil deposits and metal  resources, as well as in the exploration of geothermal energy.  The application field is expected to expand in the future with  further progress in the RD of remote sensing technology.    In June 1992, JERS-1 began to be used for practical  applications, and efforts are currently being made to adapt a  data processing method for the satellite. At the same time, the  development of the technology needed to process and analyze the  data obtained from ASTER is under way in cooperation with the  EOSDIS data processing and distribution system of the United  States. ASTER will be put into commercial operation in 1998.    So far, Japan has lagged behind other  technologically-advanced countries in developing the technology  to use remote-sensed data. However, it is expected that the  number of customers using the data will increase in the future  as a result of the improvement of data utilization systems.  Efforts to improve the system are currently under way in  preparation for the reception of data from JERS-1 and ASTER.    5. Development of Data Utilization Technology in Field  of Hydropower Development    In formulating a hydropower development plan, it is  essential  to grasp the available flow rate of water in a river. So far,  data on flow rates has been obtained by measuring the flow rates  at the measurement stations located along major rivers. Flow  rate calculations have been conducted by taking the river  surface area and other necessary elements into account. However,  there are many rivers in which it has been difficult to grasp  the flow rate due to a lack of measurement stations, as well as  for other reasons. Under these circumstances, in 1991 MITI  started to develop a method for calculating the flow rate in  Japan's rivers using the data obtained from remote sensing  satellites.    Promotion of Use of Microgravitational  Experiment Environment    A microgravitational environment prevents the convection  resulting from the presence of temperature differences from  occurring. Such an environment also prevents the separation of  materials due to differences in the specific gravities of these  materials. These advantages of a microgravitational environment  are expected to offer a better environment for experimentation  that will contribute to understanding physical phenomena better  and to the development of new useful materials. To ensure the  continued progress of space development, it is important to  understand the effects on the human body of living in a  microgravity environment for long periods of time. For the  purpose of better understanding these effects, experiments  within a microgravity environment must be stepped up in the  future. Microgravity conditions lasting for a very short time,  i.e., ranging from a few seconds to several minutes, can be  created during free falls from high towers, during ballistic  flights by airplanes, and by using a sounding rocket. However,  the microgravity conditions created using these media are not  sufficient for conducting experiments to develop new materials  or for conducting experiments involving living creatures. This  makes it essential for these experiments to be conducted in  space. NASDA has conducted research aboard the space shuttle by  seeking the cooperation of the United States. NASDA plans to  conduct experiments aboard the space station projected for the  future. In parallel with these efforts, MITI, in cooperation  with other research organizations, has been promoting the  development of an unmanned space experiment system (free flyer)  and self-returning unmanned space experiment system. At the same  time, the ministry is trying to make it easier for those  involved in space research to use their free-fall tower facility.    The experiment conditions experienced under a microgravity  differ greatly from the conditions encountered on the ground. In  order to promote the development of space technology under  microgravity, it is important to accumulate the sufficient basic  data needed to conduct the experiments smoothly. With this  understanding, MITI has been providing assistance to the Space  Environment Utilization Research Corporation and other  establishments engaged in the development of space technology.    1. Development of Free Flyer    In cooperation with the Education Ministry (Institute of  Space and Astronautical Science) and the Science and Technology  Agency (NASDA), MITI has been developing an unmanned free flyer  for conducting earth observation and conducting experiments  under microgravity conditions in space. The flyer is scheduled  to be launched by the H-II rocket in early 1995. It will be  recovered by the space shuttle that will be sent up to the  flyer's orbit six months after the flyer's launch. During this  period, various experiments will be conducted using the flyer,  with the results of the experiments expected to make it possible  for us to better use the microgravity space experiment  environment. The space flyer will play an important role as a  space experiment facility in preparation for the future  construction of a space station. The experimental equipment to  be installed on the flyer will have a modular design, which will  make it easy to replace the equipment units and the specimens  for reuse of the flyer. By employing the flyer for unmanned  experiments, the experiment environment aboard the vehicle will  be made free from the changes in gravity caused by crew  movements. This will make it possible for the flyer to realize  an experiment environment superior to that aboard the space  station. Another advantage of the flyer is the availability of  sufficient electric power to run the onboard instruments since  it will be equipped with solar batteries. MITI plans to include  experimental units involving three types of furnaces, i.e., a  single heat-source furnace, a combination heat-source furnace  and a focused-heat furnace, as an onboard experiment system to  produce high-purity GaAs crystals. GaAs, as a composite  semiconductor material, has a promising future for use in solar  electric power generation.    The efforts to develop a free flyer are currently at the  final stages of creating a flight model.    2. Development of Self-Returning Unmanned Space  Experiment Vehicle    The free flyer will provide an ideal microgravity experiment  environment. However, its disadvantages include inflexibility of  operation since it must be recovered by launching a space  shuttle, and safety requirements since the orbiting flyer must  be pulled into the cargo bay of the space shuttle by the crew  for recovery. Taking these disadvantages into consideration,  MITI plans to develop a self-returning unmanned space experiment  vehicle by seeking cooperation from the Education Ministry  (Institute of Space and Astronautical Science) and the German  government. With the self-returning vehicle, it will be possible  for Japan to launch and recover the vehicle for reuse without  requiring the help of other countries. The vehicle will provide  a solution to the problems encountered in the unmanned free  flyer. Considering the cloudy future of the space shuttle  operation, it will be necessary for Japan to develop such a  self-returning experiment vehicle. The disadvantages of the  self-returning vehicle are the limited supply of electric power  and the shorter experimental period during a single flight.    With the development of the self-returning vehicle, it will  become possible to launch experimental equipment with a total  weight of approximately 160 kg for conducting various  experiments under microgravity conditions for about a week.  Using the vehicle, it will also become possible to conduct  experiments to produce catalysts with better performance and to  evaluate the performance of carbon materials by exposing them to  the heat generated by the vehicle's re-entry into the earth's  atmosphere. Japan has yet to master the skills for recovering a  flying object from orbit. Success in the recovery will  contribute greatly to Japan's efforts in developing space  technology.    3. Positive Use of Free-Fall Experiment Tower    A free-fall tower for realizing microgravity conditions on  the ground, offering the greatest free-fall distance in the  world and which was constructed at a former coal mine in  Kamisunagawa Town on Japan's northernmost main island of  Hokkaido, was first used for experiments in September 1991.  Construction began in 1988, with the project undertaken by the  Underground Weightless Experimentation Center, a consortium of  the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO), local  governments and private companies. A free-fall tower makes it  possible for microgravity conditions to be realized repeatedly  on the ground relatively easily. Such a facility has been very  useful in conducting experiments in preparation for the  full-scale experiments to be conducted in space. For this  reason, free-fall towers are being used by space research  centers in many countries, including Bremen University in  Germany and NASA's (Louis) Research Center.    The Kamisunagawa free-fall tower has a free-fall distance of  approximately 500 meters and can produce a microgravity of  10[.sup]-4[/] lasting for 10 seconds. The availability of the  tower is expected to greatly boost Japanese research on the use  of the microgravity experiment environment.    Study is currently being conducted to promote joint space  research using the Kamisunagawa facility. Regarding one such  projected research project, MITI is considering conducting joint  research with Germany and France to develop the technology for  controlling furnace combustion under microgravity conditions,  aimed at applying the technology to the development of a  high-performance industrial furnace. As for another such  research project, the ministry is considering conducting joint  research with the United States to develop the technology for  controlling fuel combustion under microgravity conditions for  possible application to aircraft and space transport systems.    4. Activity of Space Technology Corporation    The Space Technology Corporation (STC) was founded in 1986  to  promote research and tests for creating and processing the  crystals for producing composite semiconductors under  microgravity conditions, and, consequently, to promote the  development of an advanced electronic technology. STC, an RD  company, is capitalized 70 percent by the Japan Key Technology  Center, with the rest handled by private companies. The company  has been conducting research under microgravity conditions by  launching small TEXUS rockets produced in Germany. STC's  research has focused on obtaining basic data that can only be  obtained under microgravity conditions. In the research  conducted by launching the small rockets, many useful data items  have been obtained. In particular, a feat in which the thermal  conductivity of InSb fluid was measured accurately drew  international attention. It had been impossible to obtain such  accurate thermal conductivity measurements on the ground due to  thermal convection and other effects. Considering the fact that  this kind of data is essential for growing the crystals used in  producing composite semiconductors and for the processing of the  crystals, systematic efforts must be made to accumulate such  data.    When the space shuttle Columbia was launched in 1993, STC  conducted experiments to develop new materials by participating  in the D-2 program. (The D-2 program involved experiments  conducted under microgravity conditions in the quarters aboard  the space shuttle that had been hired by Germany.) The  experiments conducted by STC involved obtaining the basic data  that will become necessary when developing new semiconductor  materials. The results of the experiments are expected to be  published in autumn 1993.    STC is the first Japanese company established to develop the  utilization of the microgravity environment of space. In this  sense, STC must assume a leadership role in the effort to  develop Japan's space industry.    5. Activities of Other Related Organizations in  Promoting Use of Space Environment    The Japan Society for the Promotion of Machine Systems  (JSPMS) has been developing small experiment systems to be used  aboard the space shuttle by taking advantage of the microgravity  conditions lasting six to seven minutes that were made available  during the launching of the small Swedish MASER rockets and  NASDA's small TR-IA rockets. In March 1989, with the cooperation  of the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc. (SJAC),  JSPMS conducted experiments on molded oxide semiconductor  materials and conducted on-the-spot observation of this  material's crystallization process aboard these rockets. In  April 1992, the JSPMS conducted a second series of experiments.  JSPMS is scheduled to conduct experiments during the September  1993 flight of a TR-IA rocket to unravel the mechanism of the  fluid phenomenon accompanying the boundary phenomenon.    On the other hand, SJAC has been involved in conducting  experiments to grow zeolite crystals aboard a German satellite,  in addition to extending its cooperation to JSPMS in the  experiments described above.    In May 1993, SJAC conducted experiments aboard the Russian  space ship Mir in which they grew crystals of proteins. These  experiments have been conducted under limited weightless  conditions. However, MITI wants the publication of the results  of these experiments to lead to recognition by the industries  and researchers concerned of the importance of promoting the  utilization of microgravity conditions.    In the meantime, the Japan Space Utilization Promotion  Center  (JSUP) has been actively introducing the results of research on  the utilization of microgravity environments conducted in Japan  and abroad, as well as research trends.    Promotion of the Development of Space Plane-Related  Technology    In order to promote space development, it is important to  substantially cut the costs of ferrying men and equipment  between the ground and space. To realize this, it is necessary  to step up the development of a space plane (space shuttle) that  can be used repeatedly. Current efforts are centered around the  development of space shuttle-type transport systems launched by  nonreusable rockets. A number of countries are currently  developing space plane-type vehicles, including Hermes being  developed by the European Space Agency and Home being developed  by Japan. In the United States, the development of a completely  reusable space plane that will take off and land just like an  ordinary aircraft is already underway.    The most difficult part of developing the space plane is the  development of the materials for use in the engines and fuselage  that must withstand temperatures approaching 1,800ëC. In  preparation for the development of such materials, MITI has  conducted a series of investigations of developments occurring  between 1987 and 1990. In addition, MITI has promoted such  development through the RD Project of Basic Technologies for  Future Industries (""Next Generation Project"") being undertaken  by the government's Agency of Industrial Science and Technology,  and by promoting efforts through its program for the Improvement  of RD Infrastructures being launched by the New Energy  Development Organization (NEDO).    1. Development of Advanced Super-High  Temperature-Withstanding Materials    The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology kicked off  an  eight-year project in 1989 to develop advanced super-high  temperature-withstanding materials as part of the agency's  endeavors in the Next Generation Project. The interdisciplinary  project involves researchers from the agency's laboratories, the  nation's universities, and private companies who are developing  materials with super-high temperature-withstanding and good  antioxidation capabilities suitable for use in constructing the  space plane. The materials under development include Ti-Al and  Nl-Al intermetallics, as well as composite materials reinforced  with carbon or silicon carbide fibers.    This project has attracted considerable interest from  foreign  companies. So far, a number of foreign companies, including  Rolls-Royce, have participated in the project by extending  cooperation to the Research and Development Institute of Metals  and Composites for Future Industries (RIMCOF), an organization  representing the private sector that is responsible for  promoting the project.    2. Activities of Japan Ultra-High Temperature Materials  Research Center (JUTEM)    As part of the project of Improvement of RD  Infrastructures,  JUTEM was established to help NEDO with the development of  super-high temperature-withstanding materials. The center is  responsible for making the facilities needed to produce  super-high temperature-withstanding materials and to evaluate  the materials developed that are available to Japanese and  foreign researchers.    The center has two regional centers--one in Ube City,  Yamaguchi Prefecture, and the other in Tajimi City, Gifu  Prefecture. The former is mainly equipped with production  facilities, while the latter mainly holds evaluation facilities.  The operation of these regional centers is being subsidized by  local governments and the companies using the centers. A portion  of the facilities at these centers became operational and  available for RD use in April 1991. It is expected that  these  centers will serve as the nucleus of regional activities for the  developing advanced technology industries.    The facilities installed at these centers have drawn  considerable attention from foreign researchers. So far, many  researchers from foreign countries have visited these centers.    Promotion of Development of Space Robot Technology    The effort directed toward space development so far has  relied mainly on manned space programs, including the Apollo  space program and programs involving the use of the space  shuttle and Mir spaceships. In order to promote space  development further, it will be essential to develop space  robots. The robots will make it possible to perform various  hazardous space tasks for the astronauts, including satellite  maintenance in orbit and constructing a large-scale space  station at comparatively low cost.    In fact, it has been found that the space station program  (preparation for it is under way, aiming at starting space  station operation in the late 1990s) will involve vast amounts  of construction and maintenance work that will be more than the  astronauts can handle. This has caused the program to be  completely reviewed.    The need for the introduction of space robots will become  more important in the larger-scale space station programs needed  in the future for the exploration of the moon and Mars.    In the meantime, Japan lags behind Canada in the development  of space robot technology. (Canada developed the robot arms  currently being operated from the space shuttle.) However, Japan  has a reached the top level of industrial robot technology, and  its potential ability in robotics has been highly evaluated  internationally. In 1990, the United States and France each sent  fact-finding missions to Japan to investigate the Japanese  situation regarding the development of space robot technology.  As described above, international cooperation in the field of  space robot technology has begun to be promoted in recent years.    Under these circumstances, MITI plans to start research on  space robot technology so that it can evaluate the fundamental  technology needed to create space robots by taking advantage of  the launch of technology evaluation satellite No 7 (EST-VII),  scheduled to be launched by NASDA in 1997.    Joint research by Japan and the United States on a technique  for mutual manipulation of a telerobot installed a very long  distance away was scheduled to start in 1993.    Study of Electric Power Generation System in Space    Amid the mounting concern in recent years about the  deterioration of the earth's environment, the Japanese  government has announced that it will make an effort to  formulate a plan to save the earth from aggravating  environmental pollution, that it will promote the transfer of  environment-related technologies to developing countries, and  that it will promote the development of new energy-related  technologies that may prevent environmental pollution from  causing further aggravation. The space electric power generation  scheme involves generating electric power using solar energy,  and transmitting the electric power thus generated to ground  stations in the form of microwave energy. This energy generation  system represents one of those new energy generation methods  being studied for possible introduction in the future in our  effort to save the earth from environmental destruction. In  order to realize electric power generation from space, a number  of problems must be resolved. These problems include the  development of a technology for constructing a large-scale  electric power generation system in space, grasping the effects  on the earth's environment of using microwaves to send the  electric power generated, and reducing the cost of constructing  such a system. Technologically, however, a major hurdle has  almost been cleared, and it is highly possible that electric  power generation from space will be realized. Since 1991, MITI  has been conducting surveys on space electric power generation  system development in Japan and abroad, on the technological  possibilities of constructing such systems, and on their  economic viability.    Study of Launching Rockets on Commercial Basis    As a result of the progress being made in recent years in  the  commercial utilization of communications and broadcasting  satellites worldwide, rockets for placing these satellites in  orbit are beginning to be launched on a commercial basis by  Ariane Space Corporation and other companies. In the meantime,  with the appearance of a company established to procure rockets  and launch them for its customers, it will become possible to  launch rockets on a commercial basis in Japan. The company was  founded by setting sights on the launch of the H-II rocket that  is under development by NASDA.    However, in order to make it possible to launch rockets on a  commercial basis in Japan, a number of problems must first be  solved. These problems include revising the space law with  respect to clauses defining the responsibility of third parties,  improving the rocket launch center utilization system,  transferring rocket-related technologies currently held by  governmental organizations, adjusting interests with fishermen,  and developing the demand to ensure that rocket launching will  continue on a commercial basis.    Since 1993, MITI has been making an effort to realize the  launching of domestically-developed rockets on a commercial  basis.    Survey of Situation of Development of Next-Generation  Commercial Satellites and Their Utilization    The need for developing next-generation commercial  satellites  has been mounting in recent years. For example, in the case of  satellites for observing the earth's environment, disaster areas  and conditions on the ground, the next-generation satellites  will make it possible to establish more sophisticated earth  observation systems that will allow observation to be realized  at greater frequencies. However, many problems must still be  solved before development can proceed. These problems include  who will develop and operate the satellites, how the satellite  services will be operated, and other problems expected to be  encountered in promoting international cooperation in the  development and utilization efforts.    In preparation for such development, MITI has been  conducting  surveys since 1991 on the situation in Japan and abroad with  respect to the development of advanced commercial satellites,  focusing on ones to be used in earth observation. Parallel to  this, the ministry has been studying the measures it will  introduce to promote the development and use of the satellites  on a commercial basis.    Problems MITI Must Tackle To Promote Space Development    So far, this report has introduced the current situation in  the Japanese space industry that is experiencing a turning point  in various respects, and the efforts MITI has been making to  promote space development. There are still many problems that  must be tackled in promoting the commercial utilization of space  technology and international cooperation.    These problems include:    1. Improvement of the Industrial Infrastructure for  Better Market Competitiveness    The space industry depends heavily on government subsidies.  The Japanese space industry has not had sufficient  commercial-base experiences in its activities. Taking these  things into consideration, it is important for the industry to  promote the use of parts and hardware systems in actual space  applications, and to accumulate data on the results of actual  use. Improvement must also be made in the production and test  systems necessary to produce satellites and rockets. In  addition, the industry must formulate a corporate strategy that  will take international cooperation and the international  division of space development tasks into account.    2. Promotion of Utilization of Space Technology    An urgent task involves developing a technology that will  promote the use of the data obtained from the remote-sensing  satellites in industrial applications, and reforming the  administrative system to facilitate the commercial use of the  data. It is important to promote experiments in microgravity  conditions, including experiments using free-fall towers.  Efforts must be made to develop the demand for ground-use as  well as space-use equipment and systems.    3. Establishment of Framework for Commercial Use of  Space    The industry must strengthen competitiveness in the  international market. At the same time, the Japanese government  must take measures to promote space development and the  utilization of space technology in the private sector. Such  measures would include the legislation of laws governing the  commercial launching of rockets in compliance with the space  treaty and ensuring the availability of rocket launch centers  that can be used year-round.

Li said  that while Beijing would continue ""friendly consultations"" with  Hanoi on overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea,  these talks would cover only disputed territories, not territory  belonging to China.    ""In regards to indisputable territories, there is no  question,"" he told a business opportunities conference here  organised by the New York-based Asia Society. Li was asked  whether China would keep a pledge to its Southeast Asian  neighbours to keep the peace over territorial disputes in the  Spratly islands. The islands, which reputedly sit atop vast  deposits of oil and gas, are claimed in whole or part by Brunei,  China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.    Crestone, a Colorado-based oil company, announced last month  that it planned to drill into the Tu Chinh sandbar, about 400  kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Vietnam's coast, under terms  of a concession signed with China. But Vietnam, which claims  that the Tu Chinh sandbar is well within its special economic  zone and continental shelf, has demanded Crestone halt all  operations in the area, saying any exploration was illegal.    Li welcomed remarks by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  at the same conference Wednesday that Hanoi would pursue its  claims in the South China Sea ""through peaceful negotiations and  in an atmosphere of friendship."" He said that Beijing still  believed that claimants should jointly develop disputed areas.    Kiet told the STRAITS TIMES daily in an interview published  Thursday that while Hanoi would defend its territory, it saw no  reason to use force in Tu Chinh because of improvements in ties  with China. The Chinese and Vietnamese navies fought a brief  but bloody engagement in the Spratlys in March 1988. Hundreds  of Vietnamese were believed to have been killed in the fighting.     "
0,FT941-10165 ,"FT941-10165 _AN-EBJCNAGAFT 940210   FT  10 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: International consortium to seek oil in China's Tarim basin      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   Agip of Italy and Texaco of the US, at the head of an international oil consortium, have initialled an agreement to explore in the vast Tarim basin area of China's remote western region. Mr William Doyle, Director of Texaco China, described the 9,814 sq km Tarim bloc as a 'world class opportunity' for the five-member partnership, in which Agip will be the operating company. Other members of the consortium include Elf of France and two Japanese companies - Japan Energy Company and the Japan Petroleum Exploration Company. Each partner will have 20 per cent. Mr Doyle said he was aware of suggestions that China was offering less prospective areas in the Tarim basin to foreign participation, but Texaco was 'very pleased' with the potential of its concession, which lies at the western end of five being made available to foreign companies. China announced about a year ago that it was inviting foreigners to explore in promising onshore areas including the Tarim, which had long been eyed by the international petroleum industry as potentially 'one of the world's last great oil plays'. Response from foreign companies has been lukewarm, however, compared to the enthusiasm that greeted the opening of China's offshore areas in the early 1980s. Among factors dampening enthusiasm have been worries about lack of infrastructure in the Tarim and uncertainty about the construction of a pipeline to transport oil from the remote region. Mr Doyle said he was confident that if oil was discovered in commercial quantities that the Chinese would ensure that transport would be facilitated. He estimated a 2,000km pipeline across some of the world's roughest terrain would cost 'several billions'. Texaco has been relatively successful in its Chinese ventures. With its partners Agip and Chevron of the US, it is producing 60,000 barrels a day in the South China Sea. The American company recently signed agreements to explore in the East China Sea south of Shanghai. It is also involved in exploration in the Bohai Gulf, south-east of Beijing.

In the brigadier's opinion, ""petroleum is a strategic  element, and therefore it is necessary to remain alert to the  international interests that want to conquer the Brazilian  petroleum reserves."" According to the ESG commander, ""society  must not accept that Brazil be treated like a marginal country.""    Ferolla advocated state control on petroleum exploration  during a Science Forum discussion and during a meeting with  federal university directors, both of which were held at the Rio  de Janeiro Federal University (UFRJ).

The brigadier said it was necessary for society to be more  conscious to discussion of the great national issues. He asked  this ""especially from young people, who will be carrying out the  development of our country."" Ferolla believes Brazil lacks a  development model that takes into account the great differences  existing between its regions.    Ferolla noted: ""We require strategic planning. This is not  a job for the military but for the whole of society, because the  enemy is advancing. All it takes is to notice that our country  is breaking apart."" In the ESG commander's opinion, this  planning must not take into account the desires of the  multinational companies ""that are viewing the commercial side  alone."" He explained that this does not involve opposing the  multinational companies. Ferolla concluded: ""They may and must  gain their money, but they must not meddle with our country's  sovereignty.""     "

Gearing for the UK regional electricity companies varies between 5 per cent and 30 per cent, while US electricity utilities typically have gearing between 50 per cent and 100 per cent. Interest cover is also higher in the UK than elsewhere. BT's operating income covers its interest payments more than 11 times, that for the US 'baby bells' only between 3 and 4 times. Comparisons with continental firms are even more startling. By the second half of the decade many UK utilities will have substantial net cash and while privatised UK firms arguably face competition, they could still run happily with higher levels of debt. The anomaly arises because the companies were sold as though they were conventional businesses expecting to earn reasonable returns in a competitive market. Their restructured balance sheets reflected this, but profits have increased much faster than expected partly because competition has evolved slowly and their capacity to cut costs was higher than had been thought. BT's return on capital employed is now 21.4 per cent, compared to an average 11.4 per cent for the 'baby bells'. Higher gearing might improve returns for shareholders, but that would depend on what the companies did with the borrowed money. British Gas and the electricity generators can make a case for investing in areas of expertise such as exploration and production and power generation overseas. BT and the regional electricity companies might consider returning the cash to shareholders before it burns a hole in the directors' pockets.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "

Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, said the announcements were a 'positive indicator of the continuing potential of the UK continental shelf'. He announced the approval of the Alba oilfield, which will be developed by Chevron, the UK arm of the US oil company, at a cost of about Pounds 1.3bn. He also approved the Pounds 1bn-plus construction of a gas-gathering system by a joint venture headed by Amoco, the UK exploration arm of the US company, to transport gas to Teesside in north-east England. The Alba oilfield has an estimated 400m-plus barrels of recoverable oil but is complex and difficult to drill. The field is scheduled to start production by 1994 to reach peak output of 100,000 barrels a day by the end of the decade, when the field's second facility comes on stream. Mr Charles Smith, managing director of Chevron UK, said he believed Alba to be one of the largest oilfields that remain to be developed in the UK sector. The Amoco gas pipeline system, which should be complete by 1993, will take gas for the first time into the UK's industrial heartland at Teesside. It will supply the proposed Enron power station project, planned by ICI and a group of four regional electricity companies, but could be extended to serve other industrial customers. The pipeline system will transport 300m cu ft of gas a day from Amoco's Everest and Lomond gas fields. Its 1.4bn cu ft daily capacity would allow it to take gas from other fields. Other partners in the project include Gas Council Exploration, Amerada Hess, British Gas, Phillips Petroleum, Fina Exploration and Agip.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

Recently Cuba also had strong ties with countries of the  socialist bloc, ties which were abruptly broken. That, together  with the U.S. blockade, brought our country to the situation of  the special period.    Nevertheless, today, in the midst of these difficulties,  Cuba  is making great efforts to diversify its commercial ties with  the world. In this connection, just yesterday, British  Ambassador Leycester Coltman announced the possibility that  another British firm may come to Cuba to work in oil  exploration. At this moment, important firms from France, Great  Britain, Canada, and Sweden are working in the oil exploration  sphere in Cuba. It is a process whereby we are redirecting and  diversifying our trade with the whole world.    In Great Britain's case, Ambassador Coltman pointed out  that,  years ago, Cuba's exports were up to $50 million. In 1992, that  figure dwindled to $43 million and in 1993 to $21 million.  However, Ambassador Coltman noted that the first quarter of 1994  marked a certain recovery. In other words, it is not only in the  [word indistinct], but other activities as well.    Another thing I wanted to point out was about trade with  Latin America. Economist Osvaldo Martinez, president of the  Commission on Economic Affairs of the National Assembly of the  People's Government, recently said that in 1990, 83 percent of  our exports and 87 percent of our imports were concentrated in  Europe. Back then, Latin America represented only 7 percent of  exports and 7 percent of imports. In 1993, our exports to Latin  America grew from 7 to 14 percent, and our imports from 7 to 47  percent.    This is additional proof, along with Ambassador Coltman's  statements and other elements mentioned by the press and our  leaders, that Cuba is making efforts, in midst of its economic  difficulties, to diversify its ties with the entire world.

It said the activities of the Vietnam Oil and Gas  Corporation  in the South China Sea area have also infringed on China's  offshore oil interests.    Chen Bingqian, spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation (CNOOC), said the Vietnamese company recently marked  a group of blocks around the Nansha Islands for foreign bidding.    Moreover, the Vietnamese company has entered contracts with  overseas partners to explore the area. Chen did not disclose  the names of the foreign firms.    ""This has violated China's sovereignty rights over the  Nansha  offshore area and also infringed on our company's interests,"" he  said.    Chen also stressed that China will not accept any Vietnamese  denouncement of CNOOC and its partners' exploration of the area.  Last month a Vietnamese newspaper accused CNOOC and a US firm of  violating Vietnam's sovereignty by signing a contract to develop  the socalled Si Zhen Tan block.    The area, named Wan An Tan in Chinese, is located in the  Nansha offshore area under China's jurisdiction, Chen said.    CNOOC and Crestone of the U.S. agreed in 1992 to develop the  25,000 square metre block in a deal called Wan An Bei-21.    According to the contract, CNOOC and Crestone are to conduct  seismic work and drilling in the section.    The Vietnamese article called for the termination of the  contract and all related activities, Chen said.    But he said the contract has legal binding force and CNOOC  and Crestone are entitled to operate in the area.    ""We cannot accept unreasonable demands made by Vietnam,"" he  said.

But gas, once the oil industry's poor relation, is now the star performer      By ROBERT CORZINE   Mood swings are nothing new to the world's oil and gas industry. Its history is writ large with extreme movements in prices and a supply situation that can fluctuate rapidly between shortfalls and surplus. To some observers the 20 per cent slump in oil prices this year may be seen as merely a temporary blip. Advocates of this argument say demand and supply is nearly in balance, and that oil prices are likely to edge back up to average Dollars 17-Dollars 18 next year. The most recent price falls, they believe, reflect over-nervous financial markets, which have reacted badly to persistently low demand in the main consuming countries at a time of particularly plentiful oil supplies. But others warn that today's depressed prices may be just the first phase of a deeper collapse. They note that crude oil prices have fallen by an average of 9 per cent a year since 1991, with few positive factors on the horizon. Traders are beset with reasons why oil prices could fall further. There is the prospect of even greater amounts of oil becoming available next year from a resurgent North Sea and other producers outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. There is also considerable scope for market volatility in the run-up to the re-emergence of Iraqi oil exports, possibly as early as the second half of 1994 if Baghdad meets United Nations demands over the long-term monitoring of industry with military potential. Pessimistic observers say such conditions could even prompt the benchmark Brent Blend to fall below Dollars 10 a barrel - a level last seen in the price collapse of 1986 - although in real terms prices are already at those levels. The major oil companies had been scurrying off in search of new supplies of relatively cheap oil. That search has been fuelled by the opening up in recent years of large parts of the world previously out-of-bounds to the industry, including the former Soviet Union and China. But much of the industry's current capital spending is still concentrated in well-known areas. This is due in part to the application of new seismic and drilling technology. This is occurring both in new areas, just being opened to exploration, as well as in mature regions such as the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, whose original development can be traced to earlier periods of high oil prices. Such techniques are being used by both the major companies and a growing band of independents to add substantially to the life of many existing fields and producing regions. Such strategies have the added benefit of maximising the investment made over the years in costly infrastructure such as platforms, pipelines and terminals. For the big integrated oil companies, however, the recent decline in oil prices and the knock-on effect on their share prices has taken much of the gloss off such achievements. Suddenly the themes put forward by both the US and European majors and which so impressed the markets earlier this year - successful reductions in overheads and a renewed focus on core businesses - no longer seem so convincing. Sceptical investors wonder what will happen to the majors' cash flow if average prices next year are closer to the current level of Dollars 14 a barrel, rather than the Dollars 18-Dollars 20 a barrel to which a number of companies have successfully adjusted. Weak oil and share prices would also affect the search for ever-cheaper and bigger reserves in the world's frontier areas. Exploration efforts in remote areas of China and the countries of the former Soviet Union are in their early stages. The majors have committed large amounts of skilled manpower, but their capital costs are so far relatively small. That could soon change, however, as projects in those areas become serious competitors for scarce development funds, say analysts. The scale of such undertakings is illustrated by a recent estimate by Chase Manhattan Bank that western companies could be spending more than Dollars 5bn a year on exploration and development projects in the former Soviet Union within a 'couple of years, and much more in five to 10 years'. The integrated majors have downstream profits to fall back on when prices weaken, a factor much in evidence in third quarter results. But chronic refining over-capacity in Europe threatens to undercut margins, while the recession in Europe and Japan continues to dampen final demand. The independent exploration companies have no downstream buffer to fall back on. A prolonged period of price weakness could not only cut into new exploration and development spending. It could also trigger off an acquisition hunt by bigger cash-rich companies keen to secure sound assets at bargain prices. The financial pressures imposed on the corporate sector by low oil prices are nothing, however, to those being felt by the 12 members of Opec. The extent of the potential damage is highlighted by the fact that for every annualised dollar fall in the oil price, member states lose a combined Dollars 5bn in annual revenues. Opec's overall oil revenues have fallen steadily in the first three quarters of this year. The most recent price falls mean they could reach a level not seen since before the Kuwaiti crisis of 1990, according to a recent study by the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies. Even Saudi Arabia, the dominant producer, is experiencing a budgetary crisis. The failure or inability of many Opec members to diversify their economies and reduce their dependence on oil revenues has compounded the pain induced by the price falls. It also raises the spectre of possible social unrest in the most vulnerable Opec countries, such as Iran and Nigeria, whose non-oil domestic economies are performing poorly. The oil industry is looking to Opec to stabilise the market with production cuts. But the organisation faces a dilemma, according Gulf Arab officials. A modest cut from its current output ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day might send a positive signal that Opec can fine-tune production to suit very short-term demand. But it would also cause some members to cheat on their individual production quotas, say the Gulf officials, thereby triggering further price falls. Opec's decision in November to maintain the present production ceiling into the new year was also based on a belief that the demand will increase, either through bad weather in the industrialised world or as a result of cheap prices encouraging the greater use of oil in those economies which are growing. But the decision also reflected Opec anger that independent producers are nibbling away at the organisation's market share. Opec no longer wants to play the role of swing producer, say officials, and a production cut would simply hasten the gains being made by non-Opec producers. The decision not to budge was also a reflection of the reluctance on the part of Saudi Arabia and other large Opec states to cut quotas in advance of Iraqi exports being readmitted into the production ceiling, probably by the second half of next year. An emergency meeting will be called as soon as the UN gives the go-ahead for renewed Iraqi exports. It could prove to be one of the most contentious in Opec history given the antagonism between Iraq and its Gulf neighbours. Iraq, which has the world's second largest reserves, is adamant that it should be allowed to return to the export markets with a large quota. But that would require deep cuts in the quotas of other members, most notably Saudi Arabia, at a time when their need for oil revenues is rising. The pessimistic mood which has gripped the oil industry has shown no signs of infecting the gas sector. Gas is increasingly being viewed as the most environmentally benign fuel, a label which is ensuring a high degree of interest in developed markets such as Europe. In October the first gas was delivered to continental Europe from fields off Norway under the Troll agreement, the largest commercial contract in the history of the petroleum industry. A number of pipeline proposals are under consideration to link continental Europe with new reserves. These include the possible construction of an inter-connector between the UK and Belgium, as well as additional lines from Russia and Norway. In the US, newly-deregulated markets have resulted in higher prices, which in turn have persuaded a number of companies to explore for new reserves. Elsewhere, and especially in Asia, gas-fired power generation schemes are seen as one of the fastest and cheapest ways to make up from shortages of electricity.   Countries:-  XAZ  World.

Together, they constitute the world's sixth-largest gold producer. The deal stops short of a full merger, which the company said could not be effected without creating a large accounting charge. 'It nevertheless is tax-free and satisfies the operating and financial purposes of a full merger,' said Mr Ronald Cambre, chief executive officer of both companies. Shares of the two companies will continue to trade separately on the New York Stock Exchange, but they should trade at nearly identical prices since they would have the same outlook, operating results and dividends. Analysts welcomed the transaction, which still must be approved by New-mont Gold's public shareholders. 'This should clear up a lot of investor confusion about what the differences are between the two companies,' said Phillip Martin, a gold company analyst at Gordon Capital. Newmont Mining, once highly diversified, has shed Peabody Coal and other mining operations since 1986, and is now a worldwide gold mining and exploration company that owns 90 per cent of Newmont Gold. Newmont Gold has 19.5m ounces of gold reserves, mostly in Nevada's rich Carlin Trend. Their combination will give shareholders in both companies ownership of the same properties worldwide. Their combined gold reserves will be approximately 26m ounces, and the company projects worldwide gold production will approach 2m ounces of gold annually by 1996. The plan calls for Newmont Mining to convey all its operating assets and liabilities to Newmont Gold, as well as 8.6m shares of Newmont Gold stock. The stock transfer is intended to balance the existing price difference between the two companies. Newmont Mining shares will then be split 1.25 shares for each existing share, bringing its outstanding common stock to 85.8m shares, equal to the number of common stock outstanding in Newmont Gold once the transaction is complete. After the combination, Newmont Mining's assets will be shareholder interests in Newmont Gold.   Companies:-  Newmont Mining Corp.     Newmont Gold.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Mar. 30, 1989, slip op. at 16, applying the ``substantially limited'' clause of the definition of handicapped individual requires fulfilling Congressional intent that the Act be broadly construed without allowing the definition to become so open ended that the Act becomes trivialized. Coverage of individuals with ``temporary'' or ``correctable'' conditions, therefore, requires difficult line drawing. There can be no doubt, for example, that an individual with cancer which is operable or treatable with radiation or chemotherapy nevertheless is covered by the Act.     Cf.     45 CFR part 84, appendix A, section A3. Similarly, an individual with a condition such as diabetes or epilepsy controllable with medication is a handicapped individual under section 503. See     Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs     v.     PPG Industries, Inc.    , Case No. 86OFC9, Sec'y. Dec. and Remand Order on Remedy Jan. 9, 1989, slip op. at 16. On the other hand, courts have hesitated to extend the Act to simple, temporary conditions or injuries which can reasonably be expected to limit an individual's activities only for a short period of time. See,     e.g., Evans     v.     City of Dallas    , 861 F.2d 846, 85253 (5th Cir. 1988) (knee injury correctable by surgery not within scope of Act);     Peagle     v.

Carlson    , 567 F.2d 1171, 1174 (5th Cir. 1988) (fractured and dislocated ankle not a handicap).    I agree with OFCCP that a Congressional committee report, cited by the ALJ, on a proposed amendment in 1979 to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that did not pass, carries little weight in discerning the intent of Congress five years earlier when it amended the Rehabilitation Act to include the current definition of handicapped individual. The legislative history of the recently enacted Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 1210112213 (Supp. II 1991) is more relevant here because Congress explicitly stated that ``[t]he definition of the term `disability' *** is comparable to the definition of the term `individual with handicaps' in section 7(8)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.'' H.R. Rep. No. 485 part 2, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 50 (1990),     reprinted in     1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 332. 7           7     I recognize that the legislative history of the ADA was not yet in existence when the ALJ issued his recommended decision.         Congress used the specific example of an individual like Mr. Gray to illustrate application of the term ``substantially limits'' and to distinguish ``minor, trivial impairments'' from those that restrict ``the conditions, manner, or duration under which [important life activities] can be performed in comparison to most people.'' The report explained further that ``[w]hether a person has a disability should be assessed without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids. For example, a person who is hard of hearing is substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing, even though the loss may be corrected through the use of a hearing aid.''     Id.     at 52.    In addition, I find no basis in the Act to permit a contractor to require an employee or applicant for employment to undergo a treatment, operation or drug regimen before being considered for employment or being entitled to other terms, conditions or privileges of employment. That decision is a private one to be made by each individual with a handicap in consultation with his or her physician and other health professionals. 8  Indeed, Commonwealth has an obligation under the duty to make reasonable accommodation ``to permit an individual with a disability the opportunity to provide and utilize equipment, aids or services that an employer is not required to provide as a reasonable accommodation.'' 29 CFR part 1630, app., 1630.2(o) Reasonable Accommodation (1992). Of course, handicapped applicants or employees must be qualified, with reasonable accommodation, but a contractor must consider each handicapped individual as he finds him.          8     I note that Dr. Logan reported that Mr. Gray ``is a candidate for middle ear     exploration and possible ossicular chain reconstruction for restoration of some of the conductive loss.''     Gray Dep., Exh. 11. (Emphasis added). Mr. Gray would have to weigh the possibility of restoration of some of his hearing against the risks of surgery, a decision which is his alone to make.         For the same reason, I reject Commonwealth's contention that the reference in the regulations to the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 41 CFR 60741.7(d) (1990), requires a handicapped individual to undergo any particular treatment or surgical operation. The Guides define permanent impairment as an abnormality or loss after maximum medical rehabilitation has been achieved. But it is implicit that the appropriate rehabilitation regimen has been undertaken voluntarily by the patient with the advice of his physician.    The record is clear that Mr. Gray was qualified for the dross handler position for which Commonwealth considered him. He had worked at several laboring jobs and Commonwealth rejected him solely because of his hearing condition. P2, 5; R.D. and O. at 4.

Mar. 30, 1989, slip op. at 16, applying the ``substantially limited'' clause of the definition of handicapped individual requires fulfilling Congressional intent that the Act be broadly construed without allowing the definition to become so open ended that the Act becomes trivialized. Coverage of individuals with ``temporary'' or ``correctable'' conditions, therefore, requires difficult line drawing. There can be no doubt, for example, that an individual with cancer which is operable or treatable with radiation or chemotherapy nevertheless is covered by the Act.     Cf.     45 CFR part 84, appendix A, section A3. Similarly, an individual with a condition such as diabetes or epilepsy controllable with medication is a handicapped individual under section 503. See     Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs     v.     PPG Industries, Inc.    , Case No. 86OFC9, Sec'y. Dec. and Remand Order on Remedy Jan. 9, 1989, slip op. at 16. On the other hand, courts have hesitated to extend the Act to simple, temporary conditions or injuries which can reasonably be expected to limit an individual's activities only for a short period of time. See,     e.g., Evans     v.     City of Dallas    , 861 F.2d 846, 85253 (5th Cir. 1988) (knee injury correctable by surgery not within scope of Act);     Peagle     v.     Department of the Interior    , 813 F. Supp. 61, 64 (D.D.C. 1993) (back strain and pain due to Degenerative Disc Syndrome treatable by simple bed rest not covered);     Vissaraga     v.     Garrett    , 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9164, at *13 (N.D. Cal. June 16, 1992) (back strain and sprain not a handicap);     Grimard     v.     Carlson    , 567 F.2d 1171, 1174 (5th Cir. 1988) (fractured and dislocated ankle not a handicap).    I agree with OFCCP that a Congressional committee report, cited by the ALJ, on a proposed amendment in 1979 to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that did not pass, carries little weight in discerning the intent of Congress five years earlier when it amended the Rehabilitation Act to include the current definition of handicapped individual. The legislative history of the recently enacted Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 1210112213 (Supp. II 1991) is more relevant here because Congress explicitly stated that ``[t]he definition of the term `disability' *** is comparable to the definition of the term `individual with handicaps' in section 7(8)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.'' H.R. Rep. No. 485 part 2, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 50 (1990),     reprinted in     1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 332. 7           7     I recognize that the legislative history of the ADA was not yet in existence when the ALJ issued his recommended decision.         Congress used the specific example of an individual like Mr. Gray to illustrate application of the term ``substantially limits'' and to distinguish ``minor, trivial impairments'' from those that restrict ``the conditions, manner, or duration under which [important life activities] can be performed in comparison to most people.'' The report explained further that ``[w]hether a person has a disability should be assessed without regard to the availability of mitigating measures, such as reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids. For example, a person who is hard of hearing is substantially limited in the major life activity of hearing, even though the loss may be corrected through the use of a hearing aid.''     Id.     at 52.    In addition, I find no basis in the Act to permit a contractor to require an employee or applicant for employment to undergo a treatment, operation or drug regimen before being considered for employment or being entitled to other terms, conditions or privileges of employment. That decision is a private one to be made by each individual with a handicap in consultation with his or her physician and other health professionals. 8  Indeed, Commonwealth has an obligation under the duty to make reasonable accommodation ``to permit an individual with a disability the opportunity to provide and utilize equipment, aids or services that an employer is not required to provide as a reasonable accommodation.'' 29 CFR part 1630, app., 1630.2(o) Reasonable Accommodation (1992). Of course, handicapped applicants or employees must be qualified, with reasonable accommodation, but a contractor must consider each handicapped individual as he finds him.          8     I note that Dr. Logan reported that Mr. Gray ``is a candidate for middle ear     exploration and possible ossicular chain reconstruction for restoration of some of the conductive loss.''     Gray Dep., Exh. 11. (Emphasis added). Mr. Gray would have to weigh the possibility of restoration of some of his hearing against the risks of surgery, a decision which is his alone to make.         For the same reason, I reject Commonwealth's contention that the reference in the regulations to the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 41 CFR 60741.7(d) (1990), requires a handicapped individual to undergo any particular treatment or surgical operation. The Guides define permanent impairment as an abnormality or loss after maximum medical rehabilitation has been achieved. But it is implicit that the appropriate rehabilitation regimen has been undertaken voluntarily by the patient with the advice of his physician.    The record is clear that Mr. Gray was qualified for the dross handler position for which Commonwealth considered him. He had worked at several laboring jobs and Commonwealth rejected him solely because of his hearing condition. P2, 5; R.D. and O. at 4.     "

Li said that while Beijing would continue ""friendly  consultations"" with Hanoi on overlapping territorial claims in  the South China Sea, these talks would cover only disputed  territories, not territory belonging to China.    ""In regards to indisputable territories, there is no  question,"" he told a business opportunities conference here  organised by the New York-based Asia Society.    Li was asked whether China would keep a pledge to its  Southeast Asian neighbours to keep the peace over territorial  disputes in the Spratly islands.    The islands, which reputedly sit atop vast deposits of oil  and gas, are claimed in whole or part by Brunei, China,  Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.    Crestone, a Colorado-based oil company, announced last month  that it planned to drill into the Tu Chinh sandbar, about 400  kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Vietnam's coast, under terms  of a concession signed with China.    But Vietnam, which claims that the Tu Chinh sandbar is well  within its special economic zone and continental shelf, has  demanded Crestone halt all operations in the area, saying any  exploration was illegal.    Li welcomed remarks by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  at the same conference Wednesday that Hanoi would pursue its  claims in the South China Sea ""through peaceful negotiations and  in an atmosphere of friendship.""    He said that Beijing still believed that claimants should  jointly develop disputed areas.    Kiet told the Straits Times daily in an interview published  Thursday that while Hanoi would defend its territory, it saw no  reason to use force in Tu Chinh because of improvements in ties  with China.    The Chinese and Vietnamese navies fought a brief but bloody  engagement in the Spratlys in March 1988. Hundreds of  Vietnamese were believed to have been killed in the fighting.     "
0,FT944-18625 ,"FT944-18625 _AN-EJCE7ADEFT 941003   FT  03 OCT 94 / Arts: Colourful Berlioz      By ANTONY BYE   A decade or so ago the BBC Symphony Orchestra would probably have called its exploration of the music of Hector Berlioz, which began in the Royal Festival Hall on Saturday, simply 'Berlioz Series'. These days, in deference to the marketing men, such projects have snappy titles, often only tangentially relevant. In this case, however, the title 'Reinventing the Orchestra' actually encapsulated Berlioz's achievement as a creator of sounds and colours which until then had been essayed only tentatively by his contemporaries. For Berlioz, orchestration was an integral part of music. His artistic intentions in the Symphonie fantastique - not least its autobiographical content - were made explicit by the composer. Yet there is no sense in which Berlioz's orchestral technique, even at this early stage in his career, lags behind his poetic vision. He may have become more resourceful as he grew older, as was evident by the nimbly delivered Corsair overture which began the evening, but the orchestral effects of the Symphonie are precise, from the Chiaroscuro delicacy of the opium-induced 'Reveries' to the brashly scored nightmare of the 'Witches' Sabbath'. Given the hackneyed status of the work, Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra turned in a surprisingly fresh and powerful performance, notable for the assurance of the solo instrumental contributions and the cohesion of the ensemble work. Berlioz's legacy continues in the importance which many of today's composers attach to sound as pure sensation. Future concerts in the series (7 and 10 October) will include works by two of Scandinavia's leading young composers, Magnus Lindberg and Kaija Saariaho, already well known in the UK, for whom colour is indispensable. On Saturday it was the turn of the Dutchman Tristan Keuris, whose Concerto for Saxophone Quartet was receiving its belated London premiere eight years after it was completed. Despatched with virtuosity by its dedicatees, the Rascher Saxophone Quartet, it emerged as an attractive, rumbustuous jeu d'esprit, overlong perhaps, but teeming with incidental detail and displaying an orchestral facility of which Berlioz himself might have been proud.

In a two-hour meeting with representatives,  delegates, tour operators, and reporters attending the Cuba-94  tourism convention, President Castro answered more than a dozen  questions.    He said anything that has an impact on the economy is very  important to the country, that tourism is one of the areas with  the greatest impact, and that it is growing at a rate of almost  30 percent yearly. He added that because Cuba has tourist  potential, and especially because there is willingness to keep  it growing, tourism is considered a priority.    The blockade was also among the issues discussed at the  meeting with delegates, tour operators, and reporters from the  tourism convention. On this matter, the commander in chief said  President Clinton is maintaining his severity, but in a softer  manner and with less threatening, less bellicose words. He said,  however, that the severity of U.S. policy toward Cuba has not  changed. It remains the same.    Concerning foreign investments in the country, Fidel Castro  said the opening will be increasingly broader and that it is  perfectly conceivable because the objective is to attain the  means to develop the country.    When asked about how a socialist system can coexist with the  flow of foreign capital, Castro said that Cuba neither will give  up socialism nor defraud those who want to contribute to the  development of this and other fields, such as petroleum  exploration and exploitation.    Concerning the desired image for Cuba, Castro said he wants  to convey the image of a beautiful country with natural  conditions; a hospitable and sound nation; a well-organized,  drug-free country with a warm climate and a high culture that  protects the environment.    The 15th tourism convention gathered 971 delegates from 26  European and American countries and representatives from Algiers  and the Arab world. In this convention, Cuba has signed several  contracts for the next winter and summer seasons.     "

Marathon Oil and McDermott International of the US and Japan's Mitsui and Co defeated four other teams, one of which included Exxon. Details have yet to be announced, but the deal appears to be the most ambitious of its kind to date. The Russian government hopes to conclude several more agreements with western oil companies to help revive flagging domestic production. The deal, due to be concluded on March 31, is for a feasibility study into the development of reserves estimated at 730m barrels of oil and more than 400bn cubic metres of gas. Such resources are of immediate interest to Japan, just south of Sakhalin. A Mitsui official said the consortium had made 'small' changes to its original proposals after Russia set new conditions, including demands related to the needs of local people. The composition of the committee responsible for taking the decision was changed in midstream, he said. A Russian industry expert said that local authorities in Sakhalin had pressed for the tender to be restarted from scratch, but that the choice of the US-Japanese consortium signified a victory for central Russian authorities in Moscow. Although the agreement is formally for a feasibility study, the oil companies are likely already to have reached an understanding with Russian authorities on profit-sharing. Moscow is also due soon to produce legislation on mineral rights to clarify the position of foreign investors. The feasibility study is expected to take about 18 months. Providing the facilities and infrastructure would require a further three to five years, with production likely to begin in the late 1990s. Russia's Ministry for Ecology and Natural Resources said: 'Given the extremely harsh conditions of weather and pack ice . . . this will be one of the largest and most complex hydrocarbon developments ever attempted.'

However, another possibility is the evaluation of  gravimetric and magnetic fields which supposedly can be measured  quickly and inexpensively. Now, a software system called Igmas  which was developed at the Free University of Berl in (Dr.  Hans-Juergen Goetze, Institut fuer Geologie, Malteserstr.  74-100, 12249 Berlin) allows the three-dimensional interactive  evaluation of these measurements.    As Professor Goetze explains, the gravity and magnetic  fields  are changed by anomalies in the geological structure.  Identification of these anomalies using high-resolution  measuring instruments is relatively quick and simple so that  these anomalies can be used for the exploration of deposits.  However, complex calculations are required to relate the local  geological formations to the measured anomalies.    These types of calculations require an enormous amount of  computing time. Therefore, it was not possible until now to  obtain a clear picture of the geological conditions based on the  anomalies of the local gravity or magnetic fields. So far, such  evaluations were used only to confirm the results of seismic  methods.    According to Goetz, Igmas is able to provide a much more  detailed evaluation of the anomalies measurements. Basically,  the program uses the representation of geological structures as  three-dimensional polyhedrons of any shape. The user models the  geological structures until the calculated anomalies agree with  the measured values.    As Goetze reports, the result is then illustrated on the  screen which greatly facilitates the search for a potential  deposit site. Igmas can also be used for the interpretation of  gravimetric well hole measurements.    The program has interfaces to connect to conventional  seismic  evaluation programs and therefore allows a complex  interpretation of the measured values. Igmas can also be used  for environmental purposes such as waste dump and cavity studies.     "

UN officials say that all the operations of Unisa will be on a commercial basis, and that the intention is to find an orderly method of dealing with minerals located on the international seabed, preventing 'chaos and anarchy' in the world's metals markets. The authority will be responsible for implementing the Law of the Sea Convention, a broad agreement on seabed mining that was reached after 11 years of contentious negotiations between industrialised and developing nations. The new agency's work will focus on the exploitation of billions of dollars worth of polymetallic nodules lying on the international seabed, which have been declared the 'common heritage of mankind', by the UN. The nodules contain mainly copper, nickel, manganese and cobalt, with smaller quantities of other minerals. When the negotiations started under the auspices of the UN, it was expected that commercial exploitation of seabed minerals would have started by 1998. UN officials now say that seabed mining will not begin until about 2008. The Law of the Sea Convention also creates Enterprise, the authority's commercial arm, which will oversee exploration and mining through joint ventures among private companies and states, and Tribunal, which will adjudicate disputes over seabed mining among states and companies. The authority and Enterprise will be located in Jamaica, while Tribunal will be based in Hamburg. The negotiations on the convention were drawn out because of concerns among industrialised states that developing country governments would have too much an influence on the authority and effectively control seabed mining. For their part, developing countries feared that international consortia with significant technological and financial resources would dominate seabed mining, depriving poorer countries of the benefits. The treaty that the ISA will administer makes provision for the protection of land-based producers of minerals found on the international market. Land-based producers were worried that unregulated seabed mining could flood markets and depress prices.   Countries:-  JMZ  Jamaica, Caribbean.

And state-linked businesses have been ordered to sever ties  with dissidents, Chinese sources told The Standard yesterday.    Dissidents believe the authorities feared that greater  economic capabilities would enable them to expand political  activities.    A dissident whose business was affected by police actions  complained: ""It is more difficult for us to run a business, not  only because of the austerity measures, but also the disturbance  created by the secret police.""    Sources said that Jia Chunwang, head of the Ministry of  State  Security, recently asked Song Jian, chairman of the State  Science and Technology Commission, to keep the commission's  subordinate enterprises away from the dissident businesses.    A dissident, who was jailed for almost a year after the 1989  Tiananmen Square military crackdown, had signed a contract with  an enterprise under the commission on the exploration of a land  development.    Under the Security Ministry's intervention, the plan was  frustrated and his company plunged into difficulties.    A press conference planned by the dissident about his  business plan was barred a few months ago as the police stopped  a Beijing hotel from renting a room to him to hold the function.    Released veteran dissident Wang Xizhe, who opened a  jewellery  shop in Guangzhou over the weekend, was annoyed by police  interference in his business.    ""I am a businessman, not a dissident any more. Why should my  clients be questioned by the police,"" Wang asked.

The changes come as industry, under pressure from government and  environmentalists, seeks to eliminate the use of chlorofluorocarbons, the  one-time wonder chemicals that have been destroying the Earth's ozone layer.    But the task is more complicated than simply replacing an old chemical with a  new one, government and industry experts say.    ""The transition is going to take time. . . . We're talking about retrofitting  not one industry but several industries,"" says F.A. (Tony) Vogelsberg,  environmental manager for the Freon Division at Du Pont, a major producer of  CFCs.    CFCs, discovered in 1928, help cool houses in the summer and keep them warm in  the winter. They are used to make the foam cushions on couches, in pillows --  even in stuffed toys.    Without them, refrigerators would not cool, and radios, televisions, stereos  and home computers might not work as well.    The Dark Side    But CFCs also have a dark side: When they float 10 to 30 miles above the Earth  to the stratosphere, their chlorine component eats away at the ozone shield  that protects against the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.    Industrial nations want to ban all CFC production within the next decade. But  while half a dozen or more replacements are under study, they all have some  drawbacks and no single substitute is expected to be found.    ""I don't think there's going to be a substitute that is going to be given an  A+"" on all areas of concern, said Eileen Claussen, director of atmospheric and  indoor air programs at the federal Environmental Protection Agency. ""We're  going to have to make some trade-offs.""    The EPA is examining the array of substitutes, mainly a family of chemicals  called HCFCs, to determine whether they are toxic or pose other health concerns  and how significantly they harm the environment. The HCFCs also deplete ozone  but much less severely.    ""We clearly do not want to blunder along and create a new health or  environmental problem while solving the ones that we targeted,"" said Charles  Elkins, whose EPA office is reviewing the potential toxicity of some CFC  substitutes.    Every year more than 2 billion pounds of CFCs are produced worldwide, a third  of them in the United States.    The United States banned used of the chemical in aerosol cans in 1978, four  years after the first concerns about the ozone layer were raised. Still, the  operation of more than $135 billion worth of equipment nationwide is dependent  on CFCs.    Industry turned to CFCs because they do not burn or corrode metal, pose no  direct health hazards to workers, and hold heat and cold, making them ideal  insulators.    That was before their threat to the ozone layer was understood.    Half of the ozone over Antarctica was destroyed during September and October of  1987, causing a hole in the Earth's protective shield that closes and reappears  with the seasons. Severe destruction of the ozone layer is believed to be  occurring over the South Pole again this year, according to scientists. They  say the conditions for ozone destruction are present over the Arctic, although  no massive loss of ozone has been observed there.    Firms Bite Bullet    Several large corporations have announced plans to end their reliance on CFCs,  some by the early 1990s. These include such giants as AT&T, IBM, Boeing and  General Electric.    ""We have used CFC solvents and cleaners for so long they're almost ingrained in  the manufacturing process,"" says David Chittick, vice president for environment  and safety at AT&T. Nevertheless, AT&T hopes to end all uses of CFCs by  1994.    The major auto makers are developing substitutes and are designing new  air-conditioning units to accommodate the changeover, probably in the  mid-1990s.    But the new air conditioners will be less energy-efficient and require larger  compressors, experts say. ""We feel we can do it without any dramatic effects on  the look or design of the car. It's going to be difficult though,"" says Toni  Simonetti, a GM spokeswoman.    Congress is considering legislation calling for the elimination of CFCs by the  year 2000 and at least 20 states are reviewing proposals aimed at curbing CFC  pollution. Vermont has banned the use of CFCs in auto air conditioners after  1994.    Du Pont has spent more than $100 million on research for CFC substitutes and  estimates that it will spend as much as $1 billion to build production plants  and to cover other costs during a 10-year transition period. ICI Americas,  another major manufacturer, also has spent $100 million in CFC replacement  research and recently announced plans to begin production of a substitute  cooling agent by 1992 at a new Louisiana plant.    Cutting the Demand    But developing substitute chemicals will not be enough.    As much as 30% of today's CFC demand will have to be eliminated by conservation  and recycling, government and industry experts say. Major appliance  manufacturers as well as auto makers recently have supplied their repair shops  with equipment to capture CFCs rather than let the old coolant vent into the  air.    But EPA and industry officials acknowledge that routine venting of old CFCs is  still widespread.    Shifts to new manufacturing procedures or altogether new technology could  account for a 30% reduction in CFC demand, especially in the electronics  industry, the experts say.    But some critics say that industry is slow to accept new technology. ""What  we're facing is inertia,"" says Marc Goldberg of Crynodynamics, a New  Jersey-based company that is producing a refrigeration system using helium as a  cooling agent. The system is being marketed primarily for commercial uses. The  major auto makers have expressed little interest.    Companies such as AT&T and Northern Telecom are turning to new  manufacturing procedures such as using low-solids fluxes to reduce leftover  residues and eliminate the need for CFCs as a solvent for cleaning circuit  boards after soldering.    ""This (CFC problem) has caused a whole new review of the way we do business,""  says A.D. Fitzgerald, director of environmental affairs at Northern Telecom, a  Canadian-based manufacturer of telephone equipment.    The thorniest problems have emerged in the area of refrigeration and air  conditioning because all substitutes under consideration pose energy and  environmental trade-offs, particularly in the area of global warming.

Industrial nations want to ban all CFC production within the next decade. But  while half a dozen or more replacements are under study, they all have some  drawbacks and no single substitute is expected to be found.    ""I don't think there's going to be a substitute that is going to be given an  A+"" on all areas of concern, said Eileen Claussen, director of atmospheric and  indoor air programs at the federal Environmental Protection Agency. ""We're  going to have to make some trade-offs.""    The EPA is examining the array of substitutes, mainly a family of chemicals  called HCFCs, to determine whether they are toxic or pose other health concerns  and how significantly they harm the environment. The HCFCs also deplete ozone  but much less severely.    ""We clearly do not want to blunder along and create a new health or  environmental problem while solving the ones that we targeted,"" said Charles  Elkins, whose EPA office is reviewing the potential toxicity of some CFC  substitutes.    Every year more than 2 billion pounds of CFCs are produced worldwide, a third  of them in the United States.    The United States banned used of the chemical in aerosol cans in 1978, four  years after the first concerns about the ozone layer were raised. Still, the  operation of more than $135 billion worth of equipment nationwide is dependent  on CFCs.    Industry turned to CFCs because they do not burn or corrode metal, pose no  direct health hazards to workers, and hold heat and cold, making them ideal  insulators.    That was before their threat to the ozone layer was understood.    Half of the ozone over Antarctica was destroyed during September and October of  1987, causing a hole in the Earth's protective shield that closes and reappears  with the seasons. Severe destruction of the ozone layer is believed to be  occurring over the South Pole again this year, according to scientists. They  say the conditions for ozone destruction are present over the Arctic, although  no massive loss of ozone has been observed there.    Firms Bite Bullet    Several large corporations have announced plans to end their reliance on CFCs,  some by the early 1990s. These include such giants as AT&T, IBM, Boeing and  General Electric.    ""We have used CFC solvents and cleaners for so long they're almost ingrained in  the manufacturing process,"" says David Chittick, vice president for environment  and safety at AT&T. Nevertheless, AT&T hopes to end all uses of CFCs by  1994.    The major auto makers are developing substitutes and are designing new  air-conditioning units to accommodate the changeover, probably in the  mid-1990s.    But the new air conditioners will be less energy-efficient and require larger  compressors, experts say. ""We feel we can do it without any dramatic effects on  the look or design of the car. It's going to be difficult though,"" says Toni  Simonetti, a GM spokeswoman.    Congress is considering legislation calling for the elimination of CFCs by the  year 2000 and at least 20 states are reviewing proposals aimed at curbing CFC  pollution. Vermont has banned the use of CFCs in auto air conditioners after  1994.    Du Pont has spent more than $100 million on research for CFC substitutes and  estimates that it will spend as much as $1 billion to build production plants  and to cover other costs during a 10-year transition period. ICI Americas,  another major manufacturer, also has spent $100 million in CFC replacement  research and recently announced plans to begin production of a substitute  cooling agent by 1992 at a new Louisiana plant.    Cutting the Demand    But developing substitute chemicals will not be enough.    As much as 30% of today's CFC demand will have to be eliminated by conservation  and recycling, government and industry experts say. Major appliance  manufacturers as well as auto makers recently have supplied their repair shops  with equipment to capture CFCs rather than let the old coolant vent into the  air.    But EPA and industry officials acknowledge that routine venting of old CFCs is  still widespread.    Shifts to new manufacturing procedures or altogether new technology could  account for a 30% reduction in CFC demand, especially in the electronics  industry, the experts say.    But some critics say that industry is slow to accept new technology. ""What  we're facing is inertia,"" says Marc Goldberg of Crynodynamics, a New  Jersey-based company that is producing a refrigeration system using helium as a  cooling agent. The system is being marketed primarily for commercial uses. The  major auto makers have expressed little interest.    Companies such as AT&T and Northern Telecom are turning to new  manufacturing procedures such as using low-solids fluxes to reduce leftover  residues and eliminate the need for CFCs as a solvent for cleaning circuit  boards after soldering.    ""This (CFC problem) has caused a whole new review of the way we do business,""  says A.D. Fitzgerald, director of environmental affairs at Northern Telecom, a  Canadian-based manufacturer of telephone equipment.    The thorniest problems have emerged in the area of refrigeration and air  conditioning because all substitutes under consideration pose energy and  environmental trade-offs, particularly in the area of global warming.

It is likely to open up exploration in an important new area, west of the Shetland Isles. The discovery of 250m to 500m barrels of oil, a quarter of the size of the Brent field which is the largest in the North Sea, comes as the traditional oil sector is reaching maturity. The industry estimates that development costs for the still unnamed field could reach Pounds 2bn. Mr John Browne, chief executive of BP Exploration, said: 'The discovery has the potential to open up a significant new play in the West of Shetlands province, although there is substantial further work to be done to evaluate the size of this potential.' North Sea oil operators are struggling to make a profit against rising costs, low oil prices and smaller oil discoveries. 'This is just the sort of shot in the arm the North Sea industry needs right now,' said Mr Simon Flowers, industry analyst at NatWest Securities. The field's development could cost twice as much as an oil discovery in the rest of the North Sea because of site conditions. These are among the harshest in the world, with bad weather, lack of infrastructure and water twice as deep, at 447 metres, as the deepest discovery in the North Sea. BP's new find is significant because the company believes it can be developed relatively quickly. The Clair field, 120km away, was the first to be discovered west of Shetland 20 years ago, but was never developed because the oil is heavy and the geology of the field complex. BP is working with seven other large oil companies to exploit oil from Clair using recent advances in technology. The DTI is keen to encourage companies to explore for oil in this area. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister said: 'There are excellent strategic reasons for capitalising on this early work in the Faroe-Shetland basin. It is a new area with great potential for major oil reserves.' London stocks, Page 36   Companies:-  British Petroleum.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The  report shows for the first time previously classified pictures  of two launch failures.    In the first decade of the space age, the U.S.'s Mariner-IV  probe had already succeeded in sending back to Earth the first  pictures of Mars, while all six Soviet Mars probes had failed to  reach their target.    ""In 1969, the United States was planning to launch a further  two Mariner probes to Mars,"" the program says. ""For this reason  the leadership of the Soviet Union ordered the leading  enterprise for interplanetary probes, the Lavochkin  scientific-production association, to urgently create probes for  the orbital exploration of Mars.""    On the basis of the new UR-500K rocket, later redesignated  as the Proton rocket, the Lavochkin enterprise hastily developed  the five-tonne M-69 Mars probe. However, following the  successful launch by the United States of Mariner-VI on 25  February 1969, the first attempted Soviet launch of a M-69 Mars  probe on 27 March failed. Just ""438 seconds after its launch  the rocket's third stage motor exploded"" and the probe perished.  Later the same day, 27 March, the Americans successfully  launched Mariner-VII. On 2 April, the second attempted Soviet  launch of an M-69 probe produced yet another failure.  ""Immediately after the start of the launch, a fire broke out in  the rocket's first-stage motor"" and after rising just a short  distance, the rocket plunged back to Earth close to the  launching area.    The Ostankino television program showed footage of both  space launch failures. ""Very few people have previously seen  this footage,"" the program says. Two official TASS  announcements about the successful launching of Mars-2 and  Mars-3 probes, which had been compiled beforehand and later had  to be cancelled before their publication in the media, were also  shown on screen. At the time, the Soviet media did not mention  these failures.     "

EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      President Bush's top-level task force has recommended that he indefinitely  delay decisions on whether to allow oil drilling off the Southern and Northern  California coasts until more scientific studies are completed, according to a  copy of the task force report made available to The Times.    The report suggests that Bush either defer or cancel plans to permit drilling  off the shores of California and Florida, but stopped short of recommending  that it be banned forever, as some environmentalists and California public  officials have advocated.    It also concludes that drilling off California and Florida might provide as  much as 2.1 million barrels of oil a day and replace as much as $40 billion in  imported oil over a 30-year period.    The President, who met with opponents of drilling from the California  congressional delegation last week, has promised to announce his long-awaited  and politically sensitive decision shortly.    The report, presented to Bush last January but never made public by the White  House, said existing information on potential sales of oil-gas leases off  California and Florida was too inadequate to justify a federal government  go-ahead for exploration and development.    In a finding sure to be welcomed by opponents of drilling, the report said:  ""The Task Force concludes that although many of the environmental effects of  oil and gas activities, taken individually, are acceptable, collectively they  could result in unacceptable changes to the local environment in or near the  (proposed drilling sites) unless new measures are taken to control or mitigate  such effects.""    Discussing the conflict between protecting the environment and promoting energy  development, the report said: ""Based on its review of available information,  the Task Force concludes that additional time and effort are needed before  environmental concerns can be resolved in a manner that provides an acceptable  balance between these two goals.""    Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), who made a copy of the report available to  The Times, said it was great news for opponents of offshore drilling since it  amounted to an ""environmental indictment"" of this form of oil and gas  development.    ""I hope the President will read this report and decide to grant permanent  protection to the magnificent coastal areas that are threatened with drilling,""  she said. ""If he proceeds with any lease sales off California after this  report, he will be completely missing its point.""    The task force was chaired by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and included  Energy Secretary James Watkins as well as William Reilly, administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency; John Knauss, head of the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, and Richard Darman, director of the Office of  Management and Budget.    They reported to the President on potential Lease Sale 91, ranging from north  of Sonoma County to the Oregon border; Lease Sale 95, from San Luis Obispo to  the Mexican border, and Lease Sale 116, off the southwest coast of Florida.    Boxer said the recommendations also should apply to Lease Sale 119 -- off the  Central California coast from San Luis Obispo to the north end of Sonoma County  -- but the task force report did not cover that area.    In the report, task force members said the Minerals Management Service of the  Department of Interior had spent more than $41 million on environmental studies  for these three areas during the past 15 years.    ""Nevertheless, the Task Force finds that some additional studies . . . are  needed before the Secretary of Interior makes leasing decisions in the three  areas,"" the report concluded. It said a special inquiry conducted by the  National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council found shortcomings in  the amount of oceanographic, socioeconomic and ecological information available  regarding the California and Florida coastal areas.    In some cases, the report noted, more information about possible effects of  offshore drilling will help to resolve public concerns about the practice.    ""In other cases, additional environmental protection measures need to be  developed, perhaps even tested, before leasing decisions proceed,"" the report  said. ""New working relationships and institutional arrangements may be needed  so that affected local communities have more influence on leasing, exploration  and development decisions.""    In spelling out other measures that could be taken, the task force recommended  a requirement that offshore oil be transported in pipelines instead of tankers  ""where feasible and environmentally preferable.""    It also said contingency planning, risk assessment and response capability for  oil spills should be improved. And it urged stronger protection of sensitive  areas.    ""Because some of these measures could be instituted only at considerable cost  to lessees (oil and gas producers), taken together they could substantially  reduce the benefits of developing oil and gas and could discourage the industry  from bidding for the right to Outer Continental Shelf resources,"" the report  added.    The task force also recommended that air emissions from drilling facilities off  the California coast be subject to more stringent controls -- roughly  equivalent to standards applicable to onshore installations.    The report presented Bush with several options for each of the two California  coastal areas. For Southern California, it said the government could proceed  with preparations for a lease sale, but defer a final decision until additional  scientific studies are available.    Another option would be to cancel the proposed sale and defer future leasing  decisions until the studies are finished, while establishing more stringent air  quality controls and toughen oil spill contingency plans for offshore  facilities.    Or, the task force said, Bush could put off leasing decisions until a new  five-year leasing program begins in 1992 and offer tracts only in the Santa  Maria Basin and San Diego Outer Basin in the next sale off Southern California.    Yet another option would exclude the Southern California area from  consideration in the new 1992-97 leasing period after cancellation of sale 95,  putting off drilling until late 1997 at least.    For Northern California, similar options were proposed to defer or cancel the  sale of leases. Under one plan, tracts in the Eel River Basin would be offered  in 1992-97. Another option would exclude the Northern California area from the  next five-year leasing period.

0,FT942-7410 ,"FT942-7410 _AN-EEYDRAGZFT 940525   FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (7): Discordant dial tone - The telecommunications and energy sectors      By ANGELA LONG   The dial tone for Telecom Eireann (TE) has been somewhat discordant over the past six months. National unease over raised calling charges gave way to dismay at a proposed alliance with a giant outsider, Cable  Wireless. The new chief executive of TE, Mr Alfie Kane, has big problems to solve, such as about IPounds 900m in debt (with an enormous debt/equity ratio of about 250 to 1) and thousands more employees than critics say are necessary. Comparison with Aer Lingus, the national airline - which has faced waves of union hostility as it tried to correct its overstaffing - is one calculated to ring unpleasant bells with the management of the semi-state operation. The big shadow on TE's horizon is January 1, 1998, when the European telecoms market will be opened up completely (although Ireland, like some of the smaller EU states, will get special consideration in domestic services). The level of competition across Europe is something TE could scarcely survive in its present form. But TE is having considerable success in its campaign - run jointly with the Industrial Development Authority's overseas arm - to attract telemarketing companies. With international charges for business among the lowest in Europe, Ireland has recently been chosen by Dell computers, Best Western Hotels, ICT Group and others as a site for operations that will create hundreds of jobs. Last year's charging changes aroused opposition, especially from small businesses, as local or internal national calls bore the brunt of big cuts for international use. The 'rebalancing', as TE prefers to call it, has led to an average reduction of 7 per cent in business telephone bills. Further cuts are on the horizon. Mr Brendan Hynes, chairman of TE until an abrupt and seemingly acrimonious departure two years ago, wrote his own analysis of Irish semi-state bodies (Telecom Eireann, Aer Lingus) earlier this year. Mr Hynes did not mince his words. 'Telecom Eireann is very inefficient,' he declared. From his research, he gave figures that reflected badly on the management of the country's telephone operator. Irish customers paid an average of IPounds 704 annually for each telephone line, compared with IPounds 550 in Britain and IPounds 534 elsewhere in Europe, he said. European telephone companies average one worker for 172 lines, whereas TE has one employee for every 85 (although this has come down from a figure nearer 40 just a few years ago). Population dispersal cannot justify this, Mr Hynes says; New Zealand, which has a similar population but a much greater area, has a line ratio much closer to the European norm than that of Ireland. The last National Development Plan turned a deaf ear to TE's calls for funds for investment, allocating only IPounds 27m from EU structural funds where IPounds 200m had been sought. This heightened existing suspicions that the government would prefer TE to link up with a bigger, richer outsider. However, union opposition and national defensiveness sprang to life when the government started to talk euphemistically about 'strategic alliances' late last year. In March, TE received a full proposal from Cable  Wireless to form a joint venture, with about IPounds 400m on the table. The minister, Mr Brian Cowen, has instructed the TE board to study the CW proposal and report back within six months on its feasibility - and any other options. He is also considering the establishment of an independent Irish telecoms authority equipped with enforcement powers, which could be essential if the scene changes from one serene operator to a cast of dozens scrabbling for market share. Mr Cowen's portfolio also includes energy. This is not as contentious an area as telecoms, but the future could hold some headaches for whoever is in charge. Unlike TE, there are no plans to place the energy utilities in public hands, the minister told the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation recently. However, the industry should not be complacent - the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) is currently being 'reviewed'. ESB, which was founded in 1927, is under the scrutiny of a cost and competitiveness review announced in February. This, the department says, will not only help the government decide on ESB applications to have price rises sanctioned, but also provide the minister 'with a solid regulation for future reviews of the electricity industry'. A review of the mining industry and concomitant policy was also announced late last year (Ireland has 20 per cent of western Europe's supplies of zinc). The new gas interconnector linking south-western Scotland with Ireland, at a site north of Dublin, is now on-line. At a cost of IPounds 290m, IPounds 90m of which came from the EU, the 290-km pipeline is the Republic's most significant energy project. The project involved four construction efforts, including construction of a gas compressor station in Scotland. Bord Gais, the national gas supplier, has a security gas agreement with National Power and a gas purchase agreement with British Gas. Should Ireland find fresh reserves of natural gas in current exploration, there is provision for surplus supplies to be exported back to Britain through the same pipeline. Tax incentives to promote exploration in offshore oilfields have also been in force for several years. In March Mr Noel Treacy, the Irish energy minister, awarded five exploration licences to five consortia, covering 28 blocks in the Slyne and Erris troughs. Last October's National Plan published by the Irish government made a commitment to promote alternative energy sources. The Electricity Supply Board (ESB) has been asked to bring 75 megawatts of capacity on line from such sources as combined heat and power (CHP), small hydro or wind power. This scheme is now being developed. Peat-fired power stations are also an option, although the environmental debate over further inroads into Ireland's famous peat bogs is likely to gain impetus.

GANIL-plus will  collect and sort radioactive ions produced in heavy-ion-target  collisions by GANIL, and ""re-accelerate"" them to energies  between 2 and 25 MeV [megaelectronvolt] per nucleon. These  ""radio-active beams"" will be used in nuclear physics,  astrophysics and materials science research. The upgrade was  endorsed by the Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee  (NuPECC) in May.    Work on GANIL-plus is expected to start almost immediately  following an agreement signed in mid-October by Claude Detraz of  the CNRS (the national scientific research council), Robert  Aymar of the CEA (the French atomic energy agency) and Rene  Garrec, president of the Basse Normandie region of France. The  CNRS, CEA and Basse Normandie are contributing equally to the  upgrade.    Both agencies plan to fund GANIL-plus through the internal  redeployment of resources, in line with the findings of a recent  review of large research facilities by the Conseil de Grands  Equipements Scientifiques.    The review found that neither agency could afford all the  projects it had planned or under way. Capital projects, such as  GANIL-plus, could only be funded if something else was postponed  or cancelled.    The scientific goals of GANIL-plus are three-fold and will  be  overseen by a steering committee of 12 physicists, chaired by  Ben Mottelson, the Nobel-prize-winning nuclear theorist from  NORDITA in Copenhagen.    In nuclear physics, radioactive ion beams will allow  exploration of ""superdeformed"" nuclei - nuclei that cannot be  made by colliding ordinary matter. The short-lived ions  produced by GANIL-plus will also have proton/neutron ratios  different to everyday, stable matter.    Radioactive nuclei are thought to play an important role in  the evolution of stars. Direct measurements of cross-sections  and lifetimes will test current theoretical models in  astrophysics.

0,FT932-3448 ,"FT932-3448 _AN-DFNCZAEZFT 930614   FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Enron thrives in an open market / Charting the rise of 'the US's biggest natural gas group'      By DAVID LASCELLES   Deregulation of the tightly controlled natural gas business in the US has opened up opportunities for energy companies, none more so than for Enron, based in the US oil and gas capital, Houston. Non-existent 10 years ago, Enron has mushroomed to the point where it claims  -with some justification - to be 'the nation's largest natural gas company'. Its status is embodied in the shiny skyscraper it occupies in the city centre next to other giants of the energy business. Enron was born in 1985 from the merger of a natural gas and a pipeline company. It owes its rapid growth largely to decisions taken by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to lift decades-old controls which restricted the operations of gas companies and put a lid on prices. In particular, the 'unbundling' of gas transportation and sales services gave greater freedom to companies to compete. But two other factors also played a role. One was the changing perception of gas from a by-product best flared off at the wellhead to an efficient, environmentally friendly fuel ideal for power generation. Another was the view of Mr Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, of the gas market as one of boundless opportunity. Today, Enron is in all important stages of the gas business. It has an exploration and production arm through its 80 per cent interest in Enron Oil and Gas; it owns a 40,000-mile network of gas pipelines extending up towards the Great Lakes and outwards to Florida and California; it provides gas supply and distribution services, and downstream it builds and operates power stations. The area of the market where Enron has been specially successful is in exploiting the new freedom to market gas. Its gas services division has built up a speciality in designing tailor-made long-term supply contracts for customers using sophisticated hedging and financing techniques. It also trades heavily in the gas market: 10 per cent of all the gas bought and sold in the US passes through Enron's hands. This gives it a liquidity few competitors can match. Although the biggest part of Enron's growth has come in the US, it has also exported its vision of a gas conglomerate. In April, the company opened a 1,875MW power station on the UK's Teesside. Enron owns 50 per cent of the Dollars 1.2bn facility, which it expects to be the pre-cursor to others in the UK. It is also negotiating projects in India, Germany, Turkey and Kuwait, and it has bought a stake in a pipeline network in Argentina. The strong expansion in electricity demand predicted for the Third World over the next decade is all factored into Enron's growth plans. The wave carrying Enron forward has been reflected in its results. Earnings have risen at a compound annual rate of nearly 30 per cent since 1988, reaching Dollars 306m last year. And Mr Lay is confidently predicting growth of another 20 per cent this year. 'All our businesses are doing a bit better,' he says. Mr Lay bases this optimism on the strength of the US gas market. After years of glut, he reckons that supply and demand have finally come into balance, and this is reflected in the rise in gas prices to as much as 60 per cent over last year's levels. According to US government statistics, US gas demand rose 4.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, but production went up less than 1 per cent. However, further out, Enron expects US natural gas growth to be strong well into the next century. Its latest forecast puts demand at 22,000bn cu ft in the year 2000 (it was 18,000bn last year), rising to more than 25,000bn in 2010. Enron's estimates of US gas reserves are also rosy: they suggest there is enough to last 71 years. Much of the rest of the US energy business seems to share Mr Lay's enthusiasm for gas. Other large companies such as Mobil, Shell and Exxon see a good part of their future growth coming there as well. Not everyone, however, is as optimistic about the level of reserves. Mr Robert Hermes, president of Purvin  Gertz, a Houston firm which specialises in oil and gas research, says: 'The attitude is that we've got all we want. People are over-optimistic. We have been living off a surplus, but that day is over.' He points out that the strength of the gas price has not sparked a surge in exploration activity because people are worried about the volatility of the market. Another potential cloud on Enron's horizon is the energy tax being proposed by President Bill Clinton. Although it is still not clear what form it will take, Mr Lay says he is confident it will be a tax on energy consumers rather than energy companies. That, he says, is 'a tax we can live with'. But can Enron keep up the pace now that the initial flush of deregulation is over and strong competitors are moving into the market? Mr David Fleischer, gas industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes it can. He is predicting long-term earnings growth for Enron of 15 per cent. 'It's an even better managed company than most people think it is,' he says. 'Mr Lay has turned it round during a period which buried many other companies.' Mr Lay's response to concerns about Enron running out of steam is that it is wrong to view the last five years as ones of exceptional growth for the natural gas business. For much of that period there was still regulation and uncertainty, and Enron's success came in spite of rather than thanks to events. 'The market growth will be bigger in the next five years than in the last,' he forecasts.   Companies:-  Enron Corp.     Enron Oil and Gas.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

In  recent years, the technology in gene rearrangement has shown  remarkable progress. It is in such technology that much is  dependent on producing microorganisms and plants that can be  applied to preserving the environment. The symposium consisted  of lectures, research reports, and panel discussions by  experienced scholars in genetic engineering. Debates in depth  were made on the applications of microorganisms and plants  towards environmental preservation and the values it held for  environmental influence.    A keynote lecture titled ``We are depending on the genetic  engineering technology for plants'' was given. Professor Akira  Watanabe of University of Nagoya, Bio-Molecular Question   Answer Research Center said, ``The genetic engineering  technology centered around the field of food application has  progressed. With the completion of the laboratory wing, we are  depending on the exploration of new fields in the genetic  engineering technology''.    The research presentations continued with ``The development  of plants that can resist air pollution'' (Kuro Kondo, ditto  Research Center, New Bio Product Evaluation Study Team Aggregate  Research Official), ``The purification of trichloroethylene  pollution using microorganisms'' (Osami Yagi, ditto Research  Center, Water Environmental Quality Research Project Leader),  and four other research reports on the present state of  biotechnology in environmental preservation were presented.    In addition, in the panel discussion of ``The public  acceptance of microorganism utilization for environmental  control'', the degree of public penetration of genetic  engineered bio-products that are on the market and also  biotechnology itself were discussed. It has been generally  acknowledged that our countrys knowledge of biotechnology has  been affirmative and interesting comments from the panel such as  ``In Japan, we do not see as much resistance to products that  have been genetically engineered as in Europe or the United  States. Also the oppositions are not as philosophical (as the  Europeans)'', and ``Dont forget that Japan was the first country  to use genetically engineered detergent'', were being reported.     "
0,FT931-3713 ,"FT931-3713 _AN-DCOCJAAMFT 930315   FT  15 MAR 93 / Search for glittering prizes beneath the Canadian ice: Digging for diamonds in the frozen Northwest Territories      By BERNARD SIMON   Anybody who works outdoors at this time of year in Canada's Northwest Territories must have a very good reason. Temperatures plummet as low as  400C, and feel even lower when fierce winds whip across the snow-covered Arctic tundra. A shovel's metal blade becomes so brittle that it is liable to snap when weight is put on it. Trucks and machinery must be kept running around the clock to prevent their engines freezing. A group of drillers and geologists employed by BHP, the Australian steel and mining group, are braving these conditions on a frozen lake 310km north-east of Yellowknife. Shielded from the wind by tarpaulins, they are working 12-hour shifts, day and night, around two 15-metre high drilling rigs. The men have five days of emergency rations in case blizzards cut them off from their base camp 4km away. By the time the ice starts melting in late April, the drills will have extracted 400 tonnes or more of kimberlite rock from beneath the lake, and at least one other site nearby. BHP and its partners are confident that the samples will contain enough high-quality gems to move towards construction of North America's first diamond mine. Mr Hugo Dummett, BHP Minerals' exploration manager in North America, says he will be disappointed if a mine does not materialise. 'We're minimising our chances of failure,' he says. BHP, which would have a 51 per cent stake in the project, plans to spend at least CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.68m) on the drilling programme this year. Mr John Lydall, mining analyst at First Marathon Securities in Toronto, said if a mine was built, it could supply about 7 per cent of the world's diamond market. The hunt for diamonds in the Northwest Territories has turned into one of the biggest stampedes in North American mining history. Besides BHP, a cluster of companies ranging from heavyweights such as De Beers and Kennecott, to junior exploration outfits such as Kalahari Resources, have staked claims covering 103,600sq km, an area about the size of Portugal. One timber supplier in Yellowknife said it has sold 210,000 wooden stakes in the past 12 months to mining companies, compared with 25,000 in a normal year. The staking frenzy is reflected in the share prices of some of the players: Dia Met Minerals, BHP's Canadian partner, now has a market value of almost CDollars 450m, with its share price zooming up from less than a dollar in late 1991 to CDollars 43 now. Two French banks, Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais, are in the process of buying CDollars 13m worth of Dia Met stock. The story of diamond fever in the frozen north goes back to the early 1980s when Mr Dummett, who then worked for Superior Oil, was tipped off by a bush pilot that De Beers was prospecting along the Mackenzie River. Under cover of darkness, Mr Dummett and Mr Charles Fipke, a Canadian geologist and Dia Met's founder, landed a helicopter close to the De Beers camp and picked up some samples. Over the next few years, the search moved eastward towards the source of the vast ice sheet which millions of years ago scraped up - and then deposited - metal-bearing rocks across northern Canada. The BHP-Dia Met joint venture, which was formed in 1990, made a breakthrough in late 1991 in the Lac de Gras area, 350km east of the Mackenzie River. Samples from a kimberlite pipe beneath Point Lake yielded 101 carats of diamonds, equal to about 70 carats per 100 tonnes, which is well above the grade normally required to justify a mine. The purpose of this winter's drilling programme is to extract bigger samples from other kimberlite pipes on BHP's 875,000 acre claim. The frozen samples are transported by truck to a Dia Met processing laboratory in Colorado. The results will be made known later this year. BHP wants to have a sample of at least 2,000 carats before it decides whether to press ahead with construction of a mine. The partners are already confident that the quantity of diamonds in the Lac de Gras kimberlite pipes is sufficient to support a mine milling around 10,000 tonnes of ore a day. Their optimism is based largely on the results of research by Professor John Gurney, a geo-chemist at the University of Cape Town. Prof Gurney's theory, which appears to be supported by almost every diamond discovery around the world, is that a kimberlite pipe is virtually certain to contain diamonds if the purple-grey garnets in the pipe combine a high chrome content with less than 4 per cent calcium. According to the BHP team, the calcium content of the garnets found around Lac de Gras is 0.7 per cent or lower. What still remains to be established however, is the quality of the Lac de Gras diamonds. According to Mr Fipke, 'we can predict diamond grades. But no one can predict the per cent of gem quality.' Roughly one out of 200 kimberlite pipes contain diamonds, but only one in 20 of those has a high enough proportion of gemstones to justify a mine. The Northwest Territories diamond rush may yet come to naught. In spite of the excitement, mining analysts caution that the shares of the companies involved are for speculators only. But if all goes well at Lac de Gras, BHP and its partners could have a mine in operation by 1997 or 1998. They are unconcerned by the recent glut in the world diamond market. With many of the alluvial mines on the west coast of southern Africa as well as the big Argyle property in Australia likely to run out of stones within the next decade or so, the hope is that any new mines in the Northwest Territories will come on stream at just the right time.

According to Mr. Alliband, Australia made its first inroads  into the Vietnam market through the OTCI telecommunications  investment program in 1987. Under this program, Australia  pledged investment capital of 80 million U.S. dollars. By the  end of 1992, Australia became the sixth biggest investor in  Vietnam with 22 projects involving a total investment capital of  280 million U.S. dollars.    Recently, BHP Oil Company won a product-sharing contract to  exploit oil at the Dai Hung oil field Vietnam's continental  shelf. This development may make Australia top the list of  foreign investors in Vietnam. BHP's achievement has testified  to Australia's high position in Vietnam and also to the  attractiveness of BHP bidding procedures.    Australian companies have also taken the lead in helping  their Vietnamese counterparts with the exploration of coal,  gold, silicate sand, lead, tin, copper, manganese, and precious  stones. Australia has also collaborated with the UNDP in helping  Vietnam draft a new law on mining exploration.    Thanks to its rich agricultural and marine resources,  Vietnam  has created conditions for Australian investors to sell their  agricultural and food processing technologies. Australia has  also expressed its interest in relocating some of its textile,  garment, and footwear manufacturing companies to Vietnam.  Furthermore, Australia's service industries have made their  presence felt in Vietnam. Australia's ANZ Bank was among the  first foreign banks to open branches in Vietnam. Some  Australian law firms have also provided legal advice to foreign  investors in Vietnam. A number of Australian financial  companies have also helped Vietnam with access to international  financial standards. Recently, some of those companies allowed  their branches based in the neighboring countries to operate  directly in Vietnam.    Most of Australia's construction companies expressed their  interest in Vietnam through the formation of joint ventures,  setting up of representative offices, or signing of cooperation  agreements. They also applied for the participation in major  infrastructure building projects.     "

0,FT921-13091 ,"FT921-13091 _AN-CAWAWACVFT 920123   FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chorus of disbelief greets Mexican oil reserves claim - Industry experts agree the official figure is twice as high as it should be      By DAMIAN FRASER   PEMEX, MEXICO'S giant oil monopoly, is no stranger to criticism. But rarely can it have been as hard to take as when the company's former vice-president for exploration and production accused the company late last year of 'perfectly consciously' lying about it reserves, recording them at above double actual levels. Mr Francisco Inguanzo, who had been vice-president of Pemex's exploration and production from 1964 to 1976, claimed in an interview with the news magazine Proceso to have been commissioned in 1988 by the director of Pemex to write a report on Mexico's reserves. After eight-month of study he put Mexico's reserves at just 33.1bn barrels, subsequently reduced to 29.9bn barrels for December 1991, compared with the official estimate of current reserves of 65.5bn barrels. Mr Inguanzo's findings, while denied strenuously by Pemex, are supported by almost all other independent studies. As is shown in the accompanying table, drawn up by Mr George Baker of the University of California, Los Angeles, all but one study reckons Pemex's crude reserves are between 20bn and 30bn barrels. Pemex's figure of 65.5bn barrels includes the crude equivalent of natural gas and condensates reserves. The figure that appears to support Pemex, by the US Geological Survey refers to 'identified reserves'. This includes undiscovered reserves - which are not proven. The differences between the Pemex estimates and all the others depend in part on the classification of the huge Chicontepec field. According to official Pemex figures, the field holds 10.9bn barrels of crude oil and 6.7bn of oil equilavent, or 25 per cent of proven reserves. Pemex is not producing oil from this area, never has, and has no plans to do so in the future - and thus, according to Dr Charles Masters of the Geological Survey, Chicontepec should not count it as a proven reserve under internationally accepted standards. Pemex says it is sufficient that Chicontepec could in theory be profitably exploited. But even this is by no means certain. According to those questioned it is extremely doubtful. Mr Inguanzo, said that if Mexico was an honest country even the most unqualified engineer in Pemex would conclude that the figures for Chicontepec were 'ridiculous'. Mr Joseph Riva, a geologist at the Congressional Research Service in the US says: 'Chicontepec may never make economic sense', because the field is not uniform, and thus would require 20,000 small wells to extract all the oil. Dr Masters, who after much heart-searching finally included Chicontepec as an identifiable reserve last year, said: 'I have always had the idea that Chicontepec never is going to be used. It is not a proven researve by any means at all'. The field, he says, is 'very irregular' and 'will be a very difficult thing to produce'. The Washington-based Petroleum Finance Company, in a study commissioned by the US Department of Energy in 1990 concluded that 'the 11 per cent recovery factor used by Pemex (for Chicontepec) far exceeds the established practice for that kind of geology', and assumes a recovery factor of just 5 per cent. The difference between Pemex and independent experts does not just depend on interpreting Chicontepec. Mr Inguanzo's estimate for Pemex's oil and equivalent is a full 35.6bn barrels less than the company's, and only half the difference can be explained by Chicontepec's exclusion. Mr Inguanzo is not specific about where the other differences lie and in a detailed analysis of the Proceso interview, Mr Baker concludes that Mr Inguanzo may be referring to reserves that are supported by current production, rather than future production. Still, there is agreement among those interviewed that the number of wildcats made by Pemex in the late 1970s is not consistent with the huge increase in reserves at this time. Mexico's reserves figure jumped from 16bn in December 1976 to 72.5 bn in 1982. Mr Riva, who puts Pemex's crude reserves at 26.4bn barrels, concurs. 'I was always giving Pemex the benefit of the doubt,' he says. 'If this engineer (Mr Inguanzo) says 21bn barrels, I believe him'. Furthermore, Mr Inguanzo claims that subsequent excessive drilling has lead to a loss of water pressure in many wells, and damaged productivity. The Petroleum Finance Corporation says independent estimates of reserves in the off-shore Campeche zone are lower than Pemex's because of a sharp pressure drop in wells occasioned by a lack of water injection in drilling. None of these engineers or geologists deny that Mexico is rich in oil. Pemex's daily production is 2.7m barrels a day, or about 1bn barrels a year. It is thus, by the worse estimate of its reserves, operating at a production to reserves ratio of 21 to 1, double that of the US. Further there is a general consensus that much more oil lies undiscovered - another 35bn to 40bn barrels, Mr Riva believes. Mr Bernie Picci, an oil analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York says 'vast areas of Mexico have not been touched which are thought by statistical extrapolation to have large amounts of oil'. But bringing these undiscovered reserves to the surface is going to require money (and in the deep sea areas expertise) that Pemex does not have. As it is, Pemex will probably have to spend at least Dollars 2bn a year to maintain exports at current levels of 1.3m barrels a day. (Production is split equally between exports and domestic use. But with domestic demand increasing by 10 per cent a year, Mexico will become a net importer in 7 years unless production rises). Strapped for cash, and with reserves falling, the Mexican government will find it increasingly tempting to drop the constitutional ban on foreign companies wild-catting for oil. Mr Inguanzo's revelations, by showing that Mexico is not as rich in oil as many Mexicans thought, may hasten that day.  ------------------------------------------------------- ESTIMATES FOR PEMEX RESERVES (billion barrels)  -------------------------------------------------------              Crude             Total                oil         petroleum                        equivalent(a)  ------------------------------------------------------- Pemex         44.6          65.5 USGS(b)       44.9         (66.2) Riva          26.4         (41.7) Inguanzo     (20.9)         29.9 Baker         22.9          38.1 PFC           32.5  ------------------------------------------------------- Sources: George Baker and Mexican Policy News.  ------------------------------------------------------- (a) At Pemex conversion rate, which is more favourable than the standard US rate.

Autonomous regional leaders  Abulaiti Amudurexiti, Wang Lequan, and Keyum Bawundun attended  the conference.    In carrying out planning and pricing work in 1993, Xinjiang  unremittingly carried out the central task of economic  construction and endeavored to solve salient problems that had  surfaced during the course of economic operations, in accordance  with the arrangements made by the autonomous regional party  committee's work conference. This helped promote economic  development. The gross regional product in 1993 is expected to  total 37.7 billion yuan, an increase of approximately 10 percent  over the preceding year.    In carrying out planning and pricing work in 1994, Xinjiang  should strengthen the status of agriculture as the foundation of  the national economy, and stabilize the household contract  responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, as  well as the dual management system that combines household with  collective operations. It should make efforts to restructure  the rural economy and crop farming, and steadfastly engage in  the construction of infrastructure, basic industries, and  industries producing major raw and semifinished materials, in  order to ease ""bottlenecks"" and create fine conditions for  developing the economy and opening up to the outside world. In  1994, we should place greater emphasis on assessing and making  flexible use of our reserves and assets, and intensify  technological transformation, while maintaining moderate growth  in capital construction investment. To meet the demands of  exploration and development at the three major oil fields in  Xinjiang, we should closely integrate technical transformation  with capital construction, develop a number of related  industries that serve the needs of oil fields, and promote oil  field development. We should ensure that oil fields and the  local economy spur each other on for the sake of common  development.    While continuing to accelerate economic development in the  comprehensive economic development belt north of Tian Shan, we  should also place great emphasis on economic development in  southern Xinjiang. We should increase capital construction  investment, expedite poverty relief work, and gradually narrow  the gap between southern and northern Xinjiang.     "

Statistics show that the gross national product of Jilin  last  year reached 55 billion yuan-worth, an increase of 14.3 percent  over the previous year.    The total retail volume of commodities topped 35 billion  yuan- worth -- a growth of 18 percent over 1992.    The province has taken bold measures to transform the  operational mechanisms of its industrial enterprises, and more  and more state-owned enterprises are being granted  decision-making powers in management and operation, local  officials said.    Further reform measures have been implemented in the  personnel and income-distribution systems in about 2,600 local  state-owned enterprises. Hundreds of state-owned enterprises  have been auctioned off or sold.    The number of share-holding enterprises in Jilin province  has  reached 371 so far.    Meanwhile, the provincial government has also attached much  importance to the reform of the price system. The prices of  coal, refined oil, cement and timber are now under market  regulation.    The number of industrial products with controlled prices  have  been reduced from 23 to 12.    As one of the country's largest grain producers, Jilin has  increased its agricultural input and made special efforts to  lighten the burden on local farmers.    In spite of being stricken with serious natural disasters,  the province still managed to get a bump harvest last year, with  grain output totalling 19 billion kg and a growth of 7.1 percent  in the average income of farmers.    Taking advantage of the international exploration of the  Tuman River delta, Jilin has expanded its economic co-operation  and exchanges with foreign countries, especially neighboring  countries in northeast Asia.    The export turnover of Jilin last year topped 1.6 billion  U.S. dollars-worth, and the province actually utilized 650  million U.S. dollars in foreign investment, both substantial  growths over the previous year.    Meanwhile, the improvement of transportation and  communication facilities, and the speeding up of infrastructure  construction have created a better economic environment in  Jilin, the officials said.

0,FT921-10909 ,"FT921-10909 _AN-CBDCGACKFT 920204   FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Energy giants caught in quagmire  -The continuing turmoil in Canada's oil sector      By BERNARD SIMON   IMPERIAL Oil, Canada's biggest oil company, is set to take the knife to itself within a few days in some of the most radical surgery ever inflicted on a Canadian company. If the analysts are correct, Imperial, 70 per cent owned by Exxon of New York, will announce it is closing two, and possibly three, of its six refineries, eliminating a quarter of its 4,200 filling stations, and laying off more than 1,000 workers. Imperial's restructuring, and similar measures now under way at its arch-rival Petro-Canada, confirm that the turmoil enveloping the exploration and production side of Canada's oil industry for the past few years has now spread to the downstream refining and marketing sectors. The shakeout, in the form of acquisitions, asset disposals and partner buy-outs, is profoundly changing the shape of the Calgary-based oil and gas industry. The brunt of the blow is being felt by the integrated giants of the industry, such as Imperial, Petro-Canada and Shell Canada, which is 78 per cent owned by Royal Dutch Shell. Amoco's Canadian subsidiary is also struggling to digest its acquisition five years ago of Dome Petroleum, the crippled giant of the western Canadian industry. 'The big guys are toast and investing in them is not what you do for growth,' says Mr Verne Johnson, president of Lasmo Canada, a subsidiary of the UK-based oil and gas group. Narrowing operating margins and hefty writedowns have recently put all three of the integrated companies in the red. Imperial's CDollars 36m (USDollars 30.8m) operating loss last year was the first in its history. The pain is only partly due to the dip in oil and natural gas prices and weak demand at the pump. The protracted North American gas 'bubble' and a 10 per cent drop in sales of refined petroleum products over the past two years have probably hastened what was the inevitable. The recession has highlighted the high costs of maintaining a diverse portfolio of exploration and production properties, and a coast-to-coast retail network. 'What pays the bills are the discoveries (the integrated companies) made in the '50s and '60s,' Mr Johnson says. 'Their bureaucracies are not able to exploit the opportunities that remain.' The pace in the industry is being set by a band of smaller and more nimble operators. Headed by a new generation of entrepreneurs, they have snapped up the assets put on the block by the industry's giants. Unlike the bulk of US independents, many of the aggressive newcomers are publicly listed, giving them wide exposure to institutional and retail investors. Corporate finance has become a fast-growing business in Calgary. Among the names that are mentioned most often are Chauvco Resources, Morgan Hydrocarbons, Morrison Petroleums, Tarragon Oil  Gas and Canadian Natural Resources. While the big energy companies are looking for ways to slim down, Chauvco, for instance, boosted oil and gas liquids output by 72 per cent in the first nine months of last year. Chauvco's cash-flow and earnings doubled. These companies get their headstart from lower costs. According to the federal government's Petroleum Monitoring Agency, junior oil and gas producers had operating costs of CDollars 26.93 per cubic metre in 1990, compared with CDollars 38.74 per cu metre for the senior companies. The seniors' costs climbed by 6.6 per cent that year, compared with 2.9 per cent for the juniors. Many of the newcomers are foreign-controlled. Despite lingering restrictions on foreign investment in the Canadian energy industry, the stake of US, European and Far East investors has risen markedly. Mr Johnson says Lasmo is still looking 'quite greedily' to buy light-oil properties. The trend throughout the industry is towards specialisation. On the upstream side, producers are increasingly concentrating on specific products, such as conventional oil, heavy oil or natural gas. Mr Jack Pelletier, a corporate finance consultant in Calgary, notes that many companies are also moving away from the joint ventures which were popular in the 1960s and 1970s, preferring to operate a smaller number of properties themselves. In the overcrowded refining and retail businesses, the most successful companies are those putting the emphasis on a regional rather than national strategies. They include Ultramar in eastern Canada, Suncor in Ontario and Chevron in the west. Last week, Pay Less Holdings, a small company which has waged a fierce petrol price war on Vancouver Island, paid well above prevailing market prices for Canadian Turbo, another regional marketer in the west. Mr Frank Sayer, president of Sayer Securities, a Calgary firm which specialises in the oil and gas industry, says that 'changes in the downstream are just starting to match what's been happening in the upstream sector'. Mr Sayer predicts that it will be another year or two before the deal-making begins to subside.

0,FT944-12793 ,"FT944-12793 _AN-EJ4DUACVFT 941031   FT  31 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK must aim to become a key player in information superhighways      From Mr GRAHAM ALLEN, MP   Sir, The space you have devoted to the new information superhighway ('France ponders superhighway gamble', October 28) and its potential benefits and implications for the future ('Information groups warned on multimedia hopes', October 26) underlines the importance of the decisions currently under consideration. The screen may replace the school and this issue is of such technological, educational and economic importance that we must ensure the best possible route is taken to allow it to develop and expand. As the report by the research organisation, Inteco, has pointed out,there will not be appreciable revenues from this industry until the next century. However, this cannot inhibit public and private sector expansion into the communications revolution. The key question is the public/private partnership; for example, can public benefits be negotiated for UK citizens comparable with those Vice-President Al Gore is working on in the US? In the US, Gore is operating within a wholly private sector. Equally, in France where the public sector predominates, the ambition is for the establishment of a network of fibre optic cables linking every household by the year 2015. The EU industry commissioner favours bringing the lead in development of a European information superhighway into the domain of private companies; some other states of the EU would prefer public operators to control national infrastructures. Therefore the question is not one of whether private or public sector dominates, but how both sectors can work together constructively and create the blend which delivers the widest benefits for the citizen. In that positive context a future British government will try to develop plans for information superhighways with a close eye on European and global developments. All excursions into the exploration of such high-tech industry must take account of European competition and industry policies. The potential for exciting development exists and we must ensure that Britain becomes a key player in this new revolution and that the benefits will flow to the greatest number of individuals.

The strike is in protest against the annulment of last year's presidential poll and the arrest two weeks ago of its deposed winner, Mr Moshood Abiola. Mr Abiola has been charged with treason after declaring himself president and is in police custody waiting for a plea for bail to be heard on July 14. The government said yesterday it had made 'special arrangements' to ensure supplies of petroleum products reached filling stations in Lagos and four other southern cities - Ibadan, Engugu, Benin and Port Harcourt - after this week's strike by Nupeng, the blue-collar oil workers' union, left most filling stations dry. It also said that the army would be providing help to ease the fuel shortage and that three military barracks in Lagos were selling fuel directly to the public. In line with a tough stand it has recently taken against civilian opponents, the government said that strikers who disrupted these measures would be regarded as saboteurs. The low official price of petrol in Nigeria, equivalent to some 2p a litre, has led to smuggling abroad of refined products. Military officers have been accused of taking part in the trade. The oil producing companies have maintained normal output of crude despite the strike by Nupeng, but the senior staff association Pengassan has now warned it will go on strike by July 12 unless the government agrees to 'resolve urgently the political crisis' by upholding the result of the presidential election as well as clearing all outstanding debts to joint venture partners, estimated at Dollars 700m (Pounds 461m). Pengassan blames recent job losses in the energy sector on the government's failure to fund its 60 per cent share of the joint ventures. 'Between December and May, 3,000 members or 20 per cent of our membership have lost their jobs due to redundancies by oil service and exploration companies. These are engineers and technicians formerly employed in seismic testing, drilling and maintenance services,' an official said this week.   Countries:-  NGZ  Nigeria, Africa.

He said that Estonia holds that small nations in the U.N.  should have the same right to speak, and hoped China would make  efforts for this goal.    Qian said China has always maintained that all nations, big  or small, should be equal. Small nations are the majority in  the U.N., he said, and the functions of the U.N.

Touching on bilateral economic relations, Meri said that  Estonia enjoys a good investment environment and there is great  potential for bilateral economic cooperation.    The president hoped that China would take positive action  and  encourage Chinese enterprises to do business in Estonia.    Meri said that China is rich in oil resources and that  Estonia has strengths in oil shale exploration and utilization,  hoping that the two countries may conduct cooperation in this  regard.    Qian agreed that entrepreneurs in the oil industry of both  countries should have contacts to discuss cooperation  possibilities.    He said some small Chinese entrepreneurs are doing business  with Estonia at present and that the two governments should give  support to these enterprises.

0,FT924-7031 ,"FT924-7031 _AN-CKRCBAE3FT 921118   FT  18 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Exports add savour to Chile's fruit cocktail - The country leading the southern invasion of northern markets      By DAVID DODWELL   SOUTHERN hemisphere fruit exporters have doubled their sales to the northern hemisphere in the past decade - but Chile's 'exceptional dynamism' has enabled it to grab almost three- quarters of total gains. According to a new study by Mr Jean-Marie Codron in the latest edition of Agribusiness, significant further headway can be expected during the coming decade, though it may be accompanied by rising protectionism, and intensified trade conflict in certain fruits - particularly apples and kiwi fruit in Europe and table grapes in the US. Protection may be best organised in the unified market of the US. But this may be disguised by the use of health and food safety laws, he warns. Best growth will come in currently-closed markets like Japan and South Korea. The gains made by the southern hemisphere exporters - which include Chile, New Zealand, Argentina, South Africa and Australia - have been made possible by new technologies and faster transport as well as substantial investment by multinationals, which have been particularly active in Chile. Mr Codron's study charts the startling emergence of Chile to become the southern hemisphere's dominant fruit exporter. Between 1974 and 1990, its exports of temperate fruit soared from 74,000 tonnes a year to 888,000 tonnes. At the same time, all southern hemisphere exporters together raised exports from 824,000 tonnes to just over 2m tonnes. While New Zealand exporters also boosted sales - from 74,000 tonnes in 1974 to 386,000 tonnes in 1990 (mainly due to demand for kiwi-fruit) - all other exporters from the southern hemisphere either stagnated or fell back. Only Chile has managed significant diversification, ranging from new varieties of grapes to a range of stone fruits like plums, peaches and nectarines. Mr Codron traces a number of reasons for the spectacular growth in Chile's fruit exports: It is close to the US, with its fruit industry built up in direct consultation with Californian professionals. A broad climatic range allows it to produce a wide variety of fruits, across a long harvesting season. Grapes, for example, can be picked from November in the northern Valley of Copiapo to April in Talca province 1,100 km (680 miles) to the south. It offers natural protection against exotic diseases and pests, mainly because of its extraordinary isolated position, with the Pacific to the west, the Andes to the east, the Atacama desert to the north and Antarctica to the south. Availability of fruit during the normal 'low' season allows exporters to use cheap transport and to have frequent and regular ship departures. Multinational investors have given Chile access to 'the most modern channels and the most modern markets', using efficient transport and distribution systems, Mr Codron says. The country 'has forged solid commercial experience which it should be able to draw on when Europe ceases to be a mosaic of markets and regulations'. It has comparatively cheap labour and recently a better record of political stability than countries like like South Africa or Argentina. Chile's success is not without attendant dangers, however. In opting to rely on multinationals 'the country has taken a large risk which could one day turn against it', Mr Codron notes. Chile's success is also attracting the anger of Californians, who are 'ready to resort to any methods. . . by manipulating the quality and phytosanitary (plant health) regulations' to block grape imports in the six weeks leading up the start of their season late in May. In Europe, where the market for grapes is 'still a long way from saturation levels', conflict is likely to be focused on easily stockable products like apples, pears and kiwi fruit. While competition will be 'more threatening', Mr Codron forecasts that southern hemisphere exporters will continue to raise sales, reinforcing Europe as the main export market for southern hemisphere fruits. This is not least because of the ineffectiveness of recent protective measures put in place: 'One wonders whether the European Community is not looking today to withdraw progressively its support from producers', he muses. The damp squib of the past two decades has been Australia, which has seen its exports of temperate fruits slump from 115,000 tonnes in 1974 to a meagre 53,000 tonnes in 1990. Argentina has also stagnated, with exports rising over the same period from 305,000 tonnes to 382,000 tonnes. Both have been complacent, Mr Codron argues, because a combination of a small population and a large area of potential farm land has discouraged intensive farming techniques. Argentina has also been diverted by historic demand from Brazil, a strategic mistake given that country's severe foreign exchange problems, and the rapid growth in the output of its own fruit growers. South Africa, so long a pariah, could become a serious competitor with Chile in Europe now that it has turned its back on the policies of apartheid. Few of the gains of the past 20 years would have been possible without new technologies and speedier transport - particularly for perishable fruit like nectarines, plums and apricots. Fast refrigerator ships now allow Chilean exporters to deliver fruits to Rotterdam in less than 22 days - compared with 30 days or more a decade ago. Journeys to Philadelphia take less than 15 days compared with three weeks. Controlled atmosphere techniques have also been important in extending the growing season for fruit - like early ripening of pears using ethylene, or slowing down the ripening process. The effect of these changes will be intensification of competition in Europe, with southern hemisphere exporters like Chile and South Africa continuing to make headway. The wild card for Chile in particular will be Japan - a coveted but still-elusive market that offers the prospect of making Chile not just the leading southern hemisphere fruit exporter, but one of the most powerful suppliers in the world.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                 SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE FRUIT EXPORTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------   ('000 tonnes - Apples, pears, grapes, kiwifruit, nectarines)  -----------------------------------------------------------------                   1974-76*    1979-81*    1984-86*    1989-90**  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Chile                  74         253         529         888 Argentina             305         324         292         382 South Africa          255         253         309         358 Australia             115          81          60          53 New Zealand            74         101         233         386 Total                 824       1,012       1,423       2,067  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: FAO, USDA.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- *three-year average, **two-year average.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

""It is very important to safeguard the rights of Chinese  fishermen in the area and protect the region's rich marine  resources,"" said Zhuo Youzhan of the Ministry of Agriculture,  which oversees the fishing industry.    The heightened attention on the South China Sea comes after  a  recent fishery inspection of the Nansha Islands [Spratlys], the  first conducted in the area since 1949.    The 37 crew members, sent by the Ministry of Agriculture,  returned to Guangzhou Port in Guangdong Province on May 10 after  a 21-day exploration of 3,398 nautical miles.    During the trip, they enforced maritime regulations and  compiled a survey of fishery resources and weather patterns,  said Zhuo, who is director of the Fishery Bureau.    The data will provide information for the protection and  future development of local marine resources as well as for the  supervision of fishermen in the area, he said.    The Nansha Islands, a traditional fishing ground for Chinese  fishermen, are rich in eel, red porgy, reeves shad, prawn and  other aquatic life.    Every year more than 300 fishing boats enter the area from  Guangdong and Hainan provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Nationality  Autonomous Region. But the lack of proper supervision has led  to repeated disputes over fishing territory, Zhuo said, adding  that this is a top concern.    It is important to develop the rich fisheries with foreign  co- operation, he said, adding that China should increase  seafood production to meet increasing home market demand and  relieve fishing pressure in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and East  China Sea, which have suffered from overfishing in recent years.    The population of favorite ocean delicacies such as croakers  and hairtails there has sharply declined in recent years.

In spite of relatively weak metals prices for nearly all of the past 12 months, he reported that Minorco's operating earnings jumped by 43 per cent from USDollars 139.8m to a re-stated Dollars 200.5m. Earnings before tax for the 12 months to June 30 were lower at Dollars 308.8m, against Dollars 340m, because of reduced financial income and earnings from equity accounted investments as well as higher exploration expenditure. Minorco was finally transformed into an operating company during the past year by the transaction which merged into it the international, non-diamond interests of Anglo American and De Beers. The new assets included a wide range of natural resource and industrial interests in South America, European paper and packaging interests managed by Mondi European Holdings, Cleveland Potash, the UK's only potash mine, and a portfolio of investments based in South East Asia and Australia - most notably a 19.9 per cent interest in Normandy Poseidon, one of Australia's biggest gold producers. The company also bought a 50 per cent interest with Mondi in Aylesford Newsprint, which has started a Pounds 250m expansion project in the UK, while its Terra offshoot is to acquire for Dollars 400m the Agricultural Minerals and Chemicals group, more than doubling Terra's production of nitrogen fertilisers and establishing it as a major methanol producer. Minorco, looking to expand its shareholder base and improve its international profile, has converted its unsponsored American depositary receipt programme into a sponsored programme by appointing Morgan Guaranty Trust as sole depositary. Earnings before extraordinary items were down from Dollars 251.9m to Dollars 221.9m or from Dollars 1.12 a share to 99 cents. Profit after extraordinary items was Dollars 226.3m, against Dollars 339.7m. Minorco is paying a second unchanged interim dividend of 38 cents. In order to change to calendar year accounting, the company is reporting for an 18-month period to end-December. It intends to pay a final dividend of no less than 38 cents.   Companies:-  Minorco.

Although little more than Pounds 200m has been committed so far by the electricity companies they have plans for projects in the US, Portugal and Germany. The electricity, water and gas companies are following the lead of BT, the telecommunications group which was privatised in 1984. Its international plans, which have met with mixed success, culminated in June with its Pounds 2.88bn purchase of a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the US long-distance carrier. However, the international push by the former nationalised corporations may raise doubts about their ability to manage overseas operations and prompt calls for tighter regulation of their international activities. Ofgas, the gas regulator, wants British Gas's international operations included in its remit. Ofwat the water industry regulator, commenting on the water companies' expansion abroad, said: 'We have been doing a lot of work to prevent cross-subsidisation - money from customers' bills being used to finance this expansion.' The electricity companies' move is being led by National Power which expects to invest up to Pounds 1bn overseas by the year 2000 in projects valued up to Pounds 15bn. It recently spent Dollars 160m on Tevco, which owns power plants in the south-east of the US. It expects between 10 and 20 per cent of its earnings could be generated abroad by the year 2000. The National Grid, which operates the transmission system in England and Wales, plans to invest up to Pounds 370m overseas in the next five years. It has already spent Pounds 23m as one of a consortium which has taken over the Argentinian transmission system. Midland Electricity has indicated to the City that it is prepared to commit up to Pounds 200m in overseas investments. International expansion is a large component in British Gas's plans, in the light of commercial and legal challenges to its dominance of the UK market. Since privatisation in 1986 British Gas has spent more than Pounds 1.1bn on foreign exploration and production assets.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT922-8794 ,"FT922-8794 _AN-CELA7AAQFT 920512   FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (17): Shaky, erratic recovery - The diamond industry      By CAROLINE SOUTHEY   THESE are critical and exciting times for Angola's diamond industry as it rides a switchback which has seen production peak at 2.3m carats in 1974 and slump to 714,000 in 1985. A somewhat shaky and erratic recovery will be sustained, say officials from Endiama, the state-owned company, and the government's department of geology and mining. Mr Jose Dias, the department's secretary of state anticipates that production will rise to nearly 1.4m carats next year. The officials believe that foreign investors will respond to improved fiscal terms and a new mining law, introduced earlier this year, which allows private companies a greater role in the sector. The sector's growth in the medium to long term lies in the development of the country's rich kimberlite potential. Most of Angola's diamonds are currently mined from alluvial operations in Lunda Norte, chiefly the Cuango division. At a development cost of some Dollars 1bn, several kimberlite pipes already identified in Cuango might yield production of an estimated 3m-4m carats a year. The recovery from the mid-80s slump began in 1986 when the state operator, Diamang - which had a monopoly on official production - was dissolved and Endiama was established to reorganise the sector. Endiama, still the sole concessionaire, sought to encourage foreign investors back into the sector. Following the peace agreement last year, its policy is beginning to bear fruit. After a five-year break, Endiama early last year returned Angola's diamonds to the international fold when it agreed with De Beers Centenary, the Swiss-based mining and marketing organisation, to sell all its Cuango production through the Central Selling Organisation (CSO), which purchases, values and sells nearly 80 per cent of the world's rough diamond production. The agreement with De Beers also included a Dollars 50m loan to further develop the production from the Cuango region. The loan has now been fully drawn down to finance a seven-year contract with Odebrecht, a Brazilian company, to explore and mine diamond reserves in the Cuango. The project, brainchild of Mr Noe Baltazer, Endiama's managing director, is the most ambitious embarked on by the company. It includes the construction of a high-tech, self-sufficient operational headquarters at the remote site of Luzamba in the Cuango region. 'The Luzamba project is now the centre of gravity of our operation. Most importantly, it involves setting up a huge exploration programme in this area,' says Mr Baltazer. RST International, a subsidiary of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, originally signed an agreement with Endiama to mine diamonds around Cafunfo at the end of 1986 (a year which had seen organised operations almost grind to a halt in the Lunda Norte) and remains in operation, its contract renewed annually. The alluvial operations in Lunda Norte remain particularly threatened by illicit digging and selling. Industry officials estimate that illegal sales of high quality gems could be costing the country as much as Dollars 5m a week. Diamond exports earned Angola Dollars 190m last year, down from Dollars 242m in 1990. Angola, the seventh-largest diamond producer in the world in volume, is capable of 'making it into the first league', according to an industry official. However, according to western experts, the explosion in illegal sales poses a threat to the industry and to Endiama. De Beers, for its part, has had to buy stones on the open market at market rates in an attempt to stabilise supply. A rise in illegal mining, particularly in the Cuango region which produces 80 per cent of Angola's diamonds and some of its highest quality gems, partly explains the rise in illicit sales. Cuango sites have been flooded by thousands of diggers since the peace accord last May which allowed freedom of movement for the first time in 16 years. Illicit trading was further fuelled, western analysts believe, by a law introduced at the end of last year, now under review, which gave individuals the right to own and sell diamonds. However, these factors do not fully explain the increase. 'We could be looking at 13,000 carats a week. That would involve a lot of digging,' says one industry official. In the murky world of illicit diamond dealing, rumours abound while proof remains elusive. Popular theories include Unita releasing its stockpiles following the peace agreement, to Endiama complicity. These problems will be resolved, officials believe, by a restructuring of the industry. Legislation introduced at the beginning of this year paves the way for an end to the state's monopoly of the mining sector. The law envisages that both foreign and local private companies can invest in prospecting and mining. The law covers prospecting and research, exploration and exploitation, and taxation. Mr Dias says private, mixed or state companies can work alongside each other, with state enterprises no longer taking precedence. 'We arrived at the conclusion that state enterprises were fully concerned with administration - and were bad administrators,' he said. However, the reforms may fall short of investor expectations, for mining rights have not been made transferable and saleable, and the government still decides who is competent to operate. Investor confidence has nevertheless been boosted by the news that De Beers and Endiama, are due shortly to sign an agreement which both sides say will set precedents for future deals in the mining sector. The agreement involves De Beers investing Dollars 50m on evaluation of known kimberlite deposits and prospecting for new primary deposits in Angola. The flexible fiscal regime being negotiated as part of the deal is expected to set precedents which will prove attractive to foreign companies, not just mining houses.  -------------------------------------------------------            ANGOLAN DIAMONDS PRODUCTION  ------------------------------------------------------- Year        Number of carats      Value (US Dollars) 1980          1,485,490.00             233,922 1981          1,400,481.00             167,418 1982          1,225,445.00             103,409 1983          1,033,812.00              93,968 1984            906,046.00              57,966 1985            717,768.00              31,913 1986            266,183.70              16,571 1987            871,390,72             106,973 1988          1,044,550.00             185,934 1989          1,315,739.00             234,366 1990          1,132,851.00             232,097 1991            960,558.00             178,229  ------------------------------------------------------- Source: Endiama  -------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page VII  "
0,FT923-10905 ,"FT923-10905 _AN-CG1AVAC0FT 920728   FT  28 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ghana points the way along Africa's golden road - Growing interest in the mining potential of the continent's sub-Saharan region      By KENNETH GOODING   A USDollars 165m syndicated loan is at present being finalised that should enable Ashanti Goldfields Corporation of Ghana to expand production and join the relatively exclusive band of companies that each produce more than 1m troy ounces of gold a year. Ashanti's production boost is part of a gold mining renaissance in Ghana since a new Minerals Code was enacted in 1986, together with incentives and tax arrangements that the mining industry considers very reasonable. Ghana's gold production has jumped from an annual eight tonnes in the early 1980s to 18 tonnes last year. 'Given the outstanding geology and well-organised institutional environment, it is quite conceivable that by 1996 Ghana could be producing between 45 and 50 tonnes of gold a year,' suggests Mr Mark Keatley, senior investment officer at the International Finance Corporation, an affiliate of the World Bank. Not only that, he says, sub-Saharan Africa (which excludes the Arab countries of North Africa as well as South Africa) has the potential to produce about 165 tonnes of gold a year - nearly double last year's 84 tonnes and almost as large as Canada's present output. Past production figures are bound to be distorted, however, because nearly 40 per cent of sub-Saharan African gold production is by small-scale miners, highly entrepreneurial people known variously as artisans, galampsey or pailleurs. Mr Keatley points out that 'they are estimated to produce almost as much gold as the entire country of Chile and quite possibly much more that is not reflected in the official statistics'. At least ten African countries produce gold but about two-thirds of total output is from three countries: Ghana, Zimbabwe and Zaire. Ashanti Goldfields, which is 45 per cent owned by Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate, with the rest in government hands, is Ghana's gold standard bearer. It produced 569,475 ounces last year and expects to move up to 670,000 in 1992 and to sustain 1m ounces a year from 1996. The IFC has also been asked by the government to organise the return of Ashanti to the international stock markets and this will be done 'when suitable equity market conditions obtain', says Mr Keatley. Drawing on the IFC's investment activities in the area and research by the African Mining Unit of the World Bank, Mr Keatley prepared a paper for the recent Financial Times World Gold Conference outlining sub-Saharan Africa's gold potential. He pointed out that much of Africa had the right type of geology for successful gold mining but not every one of its 44 countries had the right 'enabling environment', by which he meant infrastructure, legal systems, official policies and institutional development. Ghana was an example of what was possible with the right enabling environment, Mr Keatley suggested. Since 1986 it had yielded three new world-class gold mines in the Tarkwa basin: Billiton's Bogosu mine producing three tonnes a year; the Terebie mine a similar amount; and the Iduapriem mine, majority owned by Golden Shamrock Mines of Australia, three to four tonnes a year. Elsewhere in western Africa, Mali had recently introduced a Mining Code based to some extent on that of Ghana. In Mali Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia brought a new gold mine into operation in 1990 which is producing an annual 3 tonnes. This would be expanded to 6 tonnes by 1994 under an expansion project in which the IFC is involved, said Mr Keatley. A serious effort was being made to promote another western African country, Burkina, to international mining companies. 'That country should be regarded as a priority exploration target,' he said. Southern Africa's biggest gold producing country is Zimbabwe, which produced almost 18 tonnes of gold last year. Mr Keatley said the country had an exceptionally well-developed infrastructure for the mining industry and it had more than 100 mines. At one end of the scale were mines such as that operated by Lonrho, with output of more than five tonnes of gold a year, and Cluff Resources, Falcon Gold and RTZ, each producing two or three tonnes annually. In contrast many small mines were producing just over 100 kg each a year. Zimbabwe was the only country in sub-Saharan Africa that offered gold mining companies a realistic chance of financing growth through a local stock market. During the past two years Cluff and Falcon had raised the equivalent of Dollars 15m by share offerings to finance mine developments. Other gold-producing countries in southern Africa are Namibia, where the first gold mine opened in 1989, and Madagascar. But the country estimated to have the highest potential was Mozambique. In the Manica area of Mozambique alone there were more than 40 abandoned gold mines with a resource base estimated at more than 50 tonnes. Zaire, in east-central Africa, had two gold-bearing provinces. One in its north east corner has been worked for its gold for two millennia. It might have been a source of gold for Egypt in ancient times. 'It is not implausible that the gold of the Pharaohs was brought down the Nile from this source,' Mr Keatley pointed out. In more recent times this gold area had been neglected. Most of it was leased by the Zaire state gold miner, Okimo, which had not invested much in exploration or development. However, last year the government agreed to sub-lease part of the concession to a South African/Belgian consortium. This joint venture - in which the IFC is a founding shareholder - would eventually produced 2.5 tonnes of gold a year and estimated that sustainable annual output of 14 tonnes could be achieved in five years. The other Zaire gold region, containing the deposits of Twangiza and Namoya, was very difficult to operate in, Mr Keatley pointed out. 'Supplies have to be trucked for two to six weeks through East Africa to reach the mining areas. Hydro-electric power stations have been installed in the mountains but in general the infrastructure is poor. 'On top of these physical constraints, Zaire is presently in the throes of a political and economic crisis unparalleled in its history. All central institutions have practically collapsed. So investors interested in these vast resources need to be well-organised and patient.' Elsewhere in east-central Africa, while countries such as Burundi, Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia have known geological potential, very little commercial-scale gold mining is going on. Mr Keatley suggested that the end of the Cold War, which had devided many African nations into two ideological camps and lead to distortions in economic policies, was very positive. Also, the more relaxed international scene enabled South African mining houses to export their expertise to other parts of Africa. However, there was much catching up to be done because during the 1980s total exploration expenditure in sub-Saharan Africa was only about Dollars 100m a year - 'a major under-investment by all yardsticks'.

Amoco, meanwhile, failed to receive a boost to downstream earnings, though a steady improvement in its chemicals business helped to make up for some of the fall in upstream profits. At Texaco, upstream exploration and production earnings fell by more than half during the period, to Dollars 150m from Dollars 352m a year before, as the price of oil plummetted on world markets. However, downstream operations, which benefit from cheaper oil, reported a rise in operating earnings, from Dollars 139m to Dollars 220m. The result, after special charges and tax adjustments, was net income for the period of Dollars 339m, or Dollars 1.21 a share, compared with Dollars 313m, or Dollars 1.11. After-tax earnings for the year as whole were Dollars 1.1bn, up from Dollars 712m, after a number of one-off items. Before special factors, net income rose by only Dollars 6m, to Dollars 1.13bn. The results reflect 'strong operational performance in the face of crude oil prices which weakened significantly in the third and fourth quarters, and which remain depressed,' said Mr Alfred DeCrade, chairman and chief executive. Amoco reported a fall in upstream earnings in the fourth quarter to Dollars 215m, from Dollars 429m the year before. This was before taking into account a Dollars 120m gain in the latest period from the sale of part of Crestar Energy. Refining, marketing and transportation earnings reached Dollars 259m - buoyed by a Dollars 50m gain from reductions in inventory - from Dollars 202m at the end of 1992. Chemicals, on the other hand, saw a further improvement on the back of higher sales and the benefits from earlier cost-cutting. Net income rose to Dollars 83m from Dollars 18m. For the quarter as a whole, after one-off items, net income rose to Dollars 584m, or Dollars 1.17, from Dollars 548m, or Dollars 1.10, a year earlier. The 1993 net income rose to Dollars 1.8bn, against Dollars 850m, before accounting changes, last time.   Companies:-  Texaco Inc.     Amoco Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The program airs  under the ""Masterpiece Theatre"" banner Sunday -- at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and  15, at 8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24.    The story is adapted from an obscure but classic autobiographical novella by  long-forgotten, turn-of-the century American writer, reformer and crusader  Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Her tale, ahead of its time in its exploration of  sexual politics, mirrors the torpor of an imaginative young wife whose husband  treats her like a Dresden doll.    In fact, this story (from 1892, when most publishers wouldn't touch it) unfolds  like the worst-case scenario of Ibsen's ""A Doll's House"" -- or what might have  happened to Nora if she hadn't managed to flee her obtuse husband and similar  toy-like marriage.    The wife in the psychological horror story (a heightened version of Gilman's  own marriage at the time) is suffering oppressive fears induced by her  hyperactive imagination, boredom and virtual domestic incarceration.    The lazy mood of the production's painterly compositions and writer Maggie  Wadey's faithful adaptation hints without histrionics at the enveloping  madness.    Indeed, the wife's musings and her silences serve to better highlight her  infrequent outbursts. Beware that the tone is so languorous it may drive some  impatient viewers to examine their own wallpaper. But actress Julia Watson in  her high-neck gowns nicely suggests the tension adrift in the quiet mansion and  especially in her attic bedroom.    What the production succeeds at is visualizing the wife's fantasies as she lies  staring into the intricate patterns of her sickly yellow wallpaper. In a  blood-freezing conclusion, with the husband (Stephen Dillon) battering at the  door and the wife ripping at the wallpaper, she fades in and out of the wall  itself.    The sequence, with the now-crazed woman embracing her own becalmed persona, is  eerily and inventively staged by former TV commercial director John Clive,  making his TV drama debut.

The program airs  under the ""Masterpiece Theatre"" banner Sunday -- at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and  15, at 8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24.    The story is adapted from an obscure but classic autobiographical novella by  long-forgotten, turn-of-the century American writer, reformer and crusader  Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Her tale, ahead of its time in its exploration of  sexual politics, mirrors the torpor of an imaginative young wife whose husband  treats her like a Dresden doll.    In fact, this story (from 1892, when most publishers wouldn't touch it) unfolds  like the worst-case scenario of Ibsen's ""A Doll's House"" -- or what might have  happened to Nora if she hadn't managed to flee her obtuse husband and similar  toy-like marriage.    The wife in the psychological horror story (a heightened version of Gilman's  own marriage at the time) is suffering oppressive fears induced by her  hyperactive imagination, boredom and virtual domestic incarceration.    The lazy mood of the production's painterly compositions and writer Maggie  Wadey's faithful adaptation hints without histrionics at the enveloping  madness.    Indeed, the wife's musings and her silences serve to better highlight her  infrequent outbursts. Beware that the tone is so languorous it may drive some  impatient viewers to examine their own wallpaper. But actress Julia Watson in  her high-neck gowns nicely suggests the tension adrift in the quiet mansion and  especially in her attic bedroom.    What the production succeeds at is visualizing the wife's fantasies as she lies  staring into the intricate patterns of her sickly yellow wallpaper. In a  blood-freezing conclusion, with the husband (Stephen Dillon) battering at the  door and the wife ripping at the wallpaper, she fades in and out of the wall  itself.    The sequence, with the now-crazed woman embracing her own becalmed persona, is  eerily and inventively staged by former TV commercial director John Clive,  making his TV drama debut.

Mr David Simon, chief executive, will set out to City analysts the company's objectives for key financial indicators over the next two years: earnings, capital spending, and debt reduction. These will reflect the directors' belief that BP's financial health has been restored to the point where it can develop new growth ambitions. But with memories of the recent crisis not entirely eradicated, the stress will be on 'discipline' and a strong balance sheet. On dividends, Mr Simon is expected to say that increases will be paid when justified by the company's improved performance. In an interview with the FT, Mr Simon - who will take over as chairman of the company next summer - said: 'We now have a 2 1/2 -year track record. However, the group remains totally committed to performance improvement.' The recovery was only 'a gateway to disciplined growth', Mr Simon added. The earnings target will suggest that the company sees substantial scope to boost its earnings well beyond the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) a year target it set in 1992. The key to improved performance will be volume growth, improvements in internal processes and continued cost cutting, according to Mr Simon. Both Mr Simon and Mr John Browne, the current head of exploration who will take over as chief executive in July, believe there are attractive growth options in the upstream and downstream segments of the business. The capital spending target is therefore likely to show an increase over this year's Dollars 3.8bn as the group seeks to expand the business once again. BP will continue to pay down its Dollars 10bn debt until it reaches the level of comparably sized oil companies such as Chevron and Mobil of the US. Mr Simon said BP was uncomfortable with debt levels which caused it to stand out among its peers. 'We want to get back into the woodwork,' he said. Mr Browne emphasised that BP was determined to restore its international reputation: 'It's the heart of our business.' Restored to health, Page 17   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

At present, Petrobras is keeping three probes busy  drilling wells in the Santos basin, and a fourth will be  installed next week.    ""The goal of this effort is to find alternatives to the  Campos Basin in Rio (the company's main drilling site). The  potential for new offshore petroleum discoveries in the Santos  basin is very high,"" said Dimas Dultra Simoes, assistant  superintendent of operations for Petrobras's exploration  department.    According to Simoes, the Santos basin has an estimated  potential of 200 million barrels of oil equivalent. The fields  already discovered in that basin are Tubarao, Coral, Estrela do  Mar, Merluza, and Caravelas. One of the producing wells in the  Caravelas field, 1-BSS-64, has the highest flow rate of any in  Brazil, contributing about 10,000 barrels of petroleum a day.    Of the three wells now being drilled, the 1-BSS-74, located  180 km off Sao Sebastiao, on the Sao Paulo coast, is the first  deepwater well in Sao Paulo. It is 1,140 meters deep. ""That well  is in the final drilling stages. Within the next several days,  we will find out if there is oil there,"" Simoes said. The other  two wells are the 1-BSS-72 and the Caravelas, an extension of  the Caravelas field.    The Santos basin has also shown good prospects as a source  of  natural gas. The Merluza field has an average production of  600,000 cubic meters of gas per day and a potential to reach the  2 million cubic meter/day level. The field has proven reserves  of 13 billion cubic meters of natural gas.    According to Simoes, interest in exploiting the Santos basin  increased after the seismic data survey done by ship from 1992  to early 1993. In that effort, which involved an investment of  $15 million, a radiography was made of the subsoil, surveying  the best sites to drill wells. ""At the moment, Petrobras is  studying an integrated project to boost production in the  basin,"" he said.     "
0,FT942-13604 ,"FT942-13604 _AN-EDXAFAE2FT 940423   FT  23 APR 94 / Travel: Three miles into the African sky - Nicholas Colchester suffers as he walks to the summit of Kilimanjaro      By NICHOLAS COLCHESTER   February is supposed to be the dry season in Tanzania. Yet Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, remained veiled in ominous mist as we drove towards it out of Kenya. Only when we reached its lowest slopes did the old volcano bare a shoulder. We piled out of the bus and gazed up at it. The ridge of ice and black lava seemed miles up. It was in fact three vertical miles above where we stood. What on earth had persuaded 12 tourists that they could walk up that? The answer was Jean-Pierre Brain, a 50-year-old French insurance executive. In normal life, he limited himself to packing opera festivals with middle-aged friends. Now he had coaxed 11 of them, including one Englishman, to share his mid-life crisis and climb Kilimanjaro in style. Dressed more like a golfer than a mountaineer, Jean-Pierre thrust his jaw at the distant summit, as if wondering whether a two-iron would do the trick. The mountain veiled itself again, and stayed hidden from us, bar the odd glimpse, for the next four days. That was on a Sunday evening. By the following Thursday night two of those three vertical miles were below us, and our doubts had become the disbelief of people about to mount the scaffold. It was midnight. We were being given 'early morning tea' in tents perched on a ridge of shattered rock 16,000ft up. The incessant rain that never falls on Kilimanjaro in February had been replaced by the driving snow that so rarely dusts its upper slopes, according to the notes on the Ordnance Survey map. In the ghastly light of miners' lamps strapped to our foreheads, we pulled on every stitch of clothing we had, and struggled, sick and white-faced, out into the night. Our capable French tour-guide, Eric Christin, had already told us what to expect. 'We will climb steeply and slowly for seven hours. We will stick together behind the Tanzanian guide in one group. This will require will-power. Some of you will vomit. If you really cannot go on, tell me and I will send you down with a guide.' The chain-gang set off, at a pace so slow that we joked about it at first. We climbed disembodiedly, inching our personal circles of light up a never-ending snow-slope of 45 degrees. The huge volcanic cone of Kilimanjaro remained invisible above and below us. Thin and frigid air whistled in and out of our lungs, one breath per step. The French chit-chat - a feature of the lower slopes - died. This purgatory continued, almost without pause, for roughly the time it takes to fly the Atlantic. Such a trial permits only the lowest form of thought. An auctioneer from Dijon furnished and refurnished his extensive chateau. I murmured 'Stalingrad, twice as bad,' like a mantra, remembering between throwing up what fun this really was. The reward came at dawn. The lip of the crater became visible not far above us. The huge scale of what we had climbed stretched beneath us, down to the violet mass of Africa. The sun rose behind the science-fiction peak of Mawenzi, Kilimanjaro's little sister. By 8am our troupe had reached the rim of the volcano at 19,000ft. We could gaze into the snow-filled crater, and at the surreal glaciers that surround it. This was Stella Point - but not the top. Light-headed with pride, altitude and lack of sleep, we all elected to climb for another hour, trudging around the rim of the crater to the summit, Uhuru Peak, at 19,385ft the highest point in Africa. Of the 50 other climbers who had been attempting the separate 'tourist' route up the mountain that night, just two stumbled with us to this true summit. Our heartiness verged on the lunatic. Two of the party collapsed on the return march around the crater. But then, to our great relief, it became clear why Kilimanjaro had to be climbed at night. The equatorial sun, grilling down on us with pure ultra-violet, had melted the top of the mountain into a great, barely climbable mound of white slush and black volcanic sand. The three guides seized the weakest members of our party, and ran them down this great, soft scree like marionettes. The rest of us staggered down in pursuit, losing 4,000 hard-won feet in just over an hour. We reached the highest tourist refuge, Kibo Huts, at lunchtime and collapsed on to grubby bunks for a brief doze. But our guide was relentless. The descent had to continue for another 10 shattering miles before we reached our camp. After 18 hours on the march, we were barely coherent. Yet we had 'done' Kilimanjaro. This epic day was the high-point of a deluxe assault. We had avoided the normal, much-trodden Marangu route up the mountain and had taken the more beautiful Machame trail. This required tents and 30 porters. The approach march was reminiscent of Nepal. But Kilimanjaro's succession of climates - from banana groves, through rain-forest, through a moss-zone that would delight any Japanese temple-gardener, through Afghanistan into Antarctica - was more striking and rapid than in the Himalaya. This is because Kilimanjaro shoots abruptly up out of a 3,000ft plain. Though by no means the highest, it is one of the tallest free-standing mountains in the world. It makes its own, relatively benign, weather; and its own flora, including peculiar Senescant trees, which populate the upper slopes like groups of green-haired muppets. The experience was not cheap. Our well-organised 10-day tour cost Pounds 1,000 per person, including two days recovering in Tanzania's game-parks. Tips to the guides and porters, plus entry fees, cost another Pounds 200. The flight cost Pounds 500. And town-dwellers like us had to spend at least Pounds 200 each buying cold-weather clothes, sleeping bags and so forth. The only mountaineering equipment needed was Diamox, a pill that stops altitude sickness. Nicholas Colchester is editorial director of The Economist Intelligence Unit.

0,FT942-10726 ,"FT942-10726 _AN-EEIC5AEVFT 940509   FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (2): Why projects stay grounded - The country's most important economic failing      By STEFAN WAGSTYL   Last month, Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister, visited the bleak sandbanks of the river Jamuna in central Bangladesh to lay the foundation stone of the country's biggest-ever investment - a Dollars 700m bridge. The bridge is sorely needed to link north-west Bangladesh with the rest of the country. Today, lorries must queue all day to cross the river by a three-hour ferry ride. Monsoons, floods and droughts disturb the traffic, as does the constant shifting of the sands in the Jamuna's shallow bed. Bangladesh is crying out for investment. From the Jamuna bridge to automatic spindles in the textiles factories and tilling machines on the farms, the country needs capital to help promote economic growth. Without faster growth, it cannot hope to meet the needs of its swelling population. The government and development organisations monitoring Bangladesh, led by the World Bank, regard the lack of investment as the country's most important economic failing. Moreover, at least as far as public investment is concerned, the problem is not a shortage of funds. It is a lack of experienced and well-motivated politicians and bureaucrats able to implement the projects on the country's books. For private investors political uncertainty, bureaucratic foot-dragging and the poverty of potential consumers all hold back business activities. Local investors have been as slow to commit themselves as foreigners. However, there are signs that a few large private projects now under consideration could come to fruition and perhaps stimulate the drawing up of other proposals. Thanks to the skill of Mrs Zia's government in bringing public borrowing well under control and curbing inflation to about 2 per cent a year, there is plenty of scope for the government to expand the public investment programme. World Bank officials believe that, far from crowding out private investment, an increased flow of public investment would stimulate private activity. The Jamuna bridge is a good example - it will permit farmers in the rural north west to bring more of their crops for sale in central Bangladesh, including Dhaka, while also giving Dhaka-based manufacturers better access to distant markets. Mr Zaifur Rahman, the finance minister, is committed to increasing the ratio of investment to economic output to an estimated 14.5 per cent in the year to June 1994 from 13 per cent in 1992-93. The eventual target is 18-20 per cent. Foreign aid donors would be ready to increase the amount of aid pledged to Bangladesh above the Dollars 2.1bn promised for 1994-95, which is roughly the same as in the past two years. However, with Dollars 5bn in unspent funds in the pipeline, there is no reason to raise contributions. One western diplomat involved in aid projects blames 'a weak government, low quality ministers and civil servants' for the delays in public investment. Among the serious losses Bangladesh suffered in its 1971 independence war was the flight to Pakistan of many senior administrators who were of west Pakistani origin. Nor did the new country's espousal of socialist economic policies enable civil servants to acquire experience of running open economies. Mr Rahman says improved monitoring of schemes will accelerate the investment flow, but diplomats of donor countries say they see little change as yet. The controversy surrounding the Dollars 510m Karnaphuli fertiliser plant, a joint venture between the government, foreign aid donors and Japanese companies, has also cast a shadow over large-scale investments. First conceived in 1980 and coming on stream later this year, the plant has been dogged by arguments about the wisdom of using Bangladesh's scarce gas resources for fertiliser production instead of fuel. Whatever the merits of the dispute, its effect has been to call into question the government's ability to implement mega-projects. However, the donor countries' decision to back the Jamuna bridge scheme, which has also been under consideration for over 10 years, shows they are still willing to take risks in Bangladesh. Similarly, they are supporting a wide-ranging flood action programme to reduce the impact of future floods following those which devastated the country in the late 1980s. By comparison, private sector investments in Bangladesh are mostly small. Factories for garments, leather and handicrafts, rarely cost over Dollars 100,000. The returns can be spectacular - recent investments in the garments industry have seen entrepreneurs recover their money in a year. Mr Jamal Uddin Ahmad, a former deputy prime minister turned business consultant, says: 'Bangladesh generates these small high risk, high return investments. But what we need is to create a more stable environment to encourage more long-term local investment and eventually foreign investment as well.' A handful of larger investments are in the pipeline. Tootal, the British subsidiary of Coats Viyella, which operates a spinning mill in Bangladesh, is building a Dollars 25m extension to increase capacity threefold. Bangladesh Tobacco, an affiliate of BAT Industries of the UK, is considering a Dollars 60m plan for modernising tobacco and cigarette production. In the longer term, foreign companies are interested in investing in telecommunications, transport and energy, if these state-dominated industries are opened up to private investment as the government plans. In oil and gas, Holland Sea Search of the Netherlands and Cairns Energy of the UK are the first of seven international oil exploration groups to have completed exploration and production agreements. Other potential investors include Occidental Oil of the US and France's Total. In electricity, International Energy Group of the US and RP Goenka group, an Indian business group, have proposed plans for building and operating privately-owned power stations - but detailed rules for the entry of private companies have not yet been established. The government hopes to complete a new energy policy, including rules for private sector participation, next month.   Countries:-  BDZ  Bangladesh, Asia.

Libya yesterday denounced the sanctions, which were imposed by the Security Council on Thursday because of Tripoli's refusal to surrender two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Scotland. The ban on new equipment as well as parts and spares for the country's oil transport, processing and export facilities is designed gradually to erode Libya's export capacity. One western oil company executive familiar with the Libyan industry said the sanctions 'were unlikely to be the straw that breaks the camel's back.' But they will close loopholes left over from earlier trade restrictions, he said. The main impact could be felt first in Libya's refineries, where fires and machinery breakdowns are relatively common especially in older facilities. The refinery boilers, furnaces, fractionation columns, pumps, catalytic reactors, and prepared catalysts which are covered by the ban can easily be bought on international markets, although the Libyans 'might have to pay two or three times the going rate' for the items, according to the executive. The ban on air transport to Libya means any urgently-needed spare parts that are acquired will have to be shipped or moved overland from neighbouring countries. The sanctions on equipment such as loading buoys and single point moorings for crude export terminals and flexible and floating loading hoses will reduce Libya's ability to repair any damage to maritime export facilities which commonly during the winter storm season in the Mediterranean. Oil industry analysts do not expect any sudden fall-off in Libya exports, which last month amounted to 1.37m barrels a day. The latest sanctions leave untouched the country's hydrocarbon export revenues, which amounted to Dollars 9.5bn last year - some 95 per cent of its hard currency earnings. And there is little evidence that European countries such as Italy, Spain and Germany which buy the high-quality, light crude oil from Libya would agree to a full oil embargo. The sanctions are also unlikely to have any short-term impact on over a dozen international oil companies with production or exploration operations in Libya.   Countries:-  LYZ  Libya, Africa.

Speaking to mining executives at PNG's annual geology, exploration and mining conference in Lae, Mr Kaputin indicated that after the large ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 857m) Lihir gold mine project was finalised, there would be a moratorium on further mining project decisions. 'Let me advise you that after this project (Lihir), we will hold everything and I have been instructed to use the next six to 12 months to come up with a new policy,' Mr Kaputin said. 'I am not, at this stage, in a position to let you know what my terms of reference are going to be, but we will be visiting a number of countries to examine their respective mining and petroleum policies in order to re-examine our own national policies.' Already, the PNG government has kept the international investment community on tenterhooks over Lihir. Originally, there were hopes that the necessary special mining lease for the project - a joint venture between Britain's RTZ group and Niugini Mining, which is controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain - would be granted by the government at the beginning of 1994. However, the matter has subsequently been bogged down in the PNG cabinet for months, with the dispute apparently centred on whether the state-owned Malaysian Mining Corporation should be brought into the project at an early stage, and what share of the equity should be given to local landowners. Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, recently told parliament that the deal would be concluded 'properly and . . . at the right time'. He added that 'we will not be pressured by lobby groups.' The decision by Mr Kaputin, who took over the mining portfolio in a ministerial reshuffle at the beginning of this year, to put future projects on hold while he reviews PNG's mining policy seems likely to jeopardise further PNG's already-strained relations with parts of the international investment community.

0," LA032989-0052   36961    March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 3; National Desk      1042 words      BUSH SENDS TOP AIDES TO ASSESS SPILL DAMAGE      By DAVID LAUTER and DOUGLAS JEHL, Times Staff Writers      WASHINGTON      President Bush Tuesday dispatched three top officials to Alaska to assess the  massive oil spill there as political controversy began to escalate over  Administration plans to expand oil drilling in an environmentally sensitive  part of the state.    Bush summoned Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, Environmental  Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost  to the Oval Office for an early morning meeting before sending them to Alaska  to ""take a hard look at where this disaster stands.""    Bush said after the session that he had received ""conflicting reports"" on the  progress that Exxon Corp. had made in containing the spill. ""I don't want to  prejudge that,"" he said, asking the top-level team to report back to him on  what additional steps may be needed.    Those steps could include federal civil penalties against Exxon, Skinner said.  The Coast Guard, which is leading federal efforts to combat the spill, will be  responsible for deciding whether Exxon violated federal regulations in its  operation of the oil tanker that struck a reef and ruptured, causing the huge  oil slick. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said that Justice Department lawyers also  will monitor the situation.    With Exxon officials now admitting that the cleanup so far has gone poorly,  Bush said that a federal takeover of the effort is ""an option"" that Skinner,  Reilly and Yost would assess. Under that approach, which Administration  officials currently consider unlikely, the government would pay for the cleanup  and then seek reimbursement from the company. Federal disaster relief officials  Tuesday also were reviewing a request from Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper for  additional federal emergency aid.    Despite the attention generated by the scope of the spill -- the largest in  U.S. history and one of the worst ever -- Bush said he felt no need to review  his Administration's plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil  drilling. ""I see no connection"" between drilling in the reserve and the  contamination in Prince William Sound, Bush said.    Environmentalists, however, who have been battling the drilling plan for  several years, lost no time in making a connection. Opening up the wildlife  reserve to drilling, they stressed, would greatly increase oil shipping along  the tanker route from the port of Valdez through Prince William Sound, the  formerly pristine waterway fouled by about 10 million gallons of oil since the  Exxon Valdez accident Friday.    The oil spill is a ""giant alarm clock"" that should awaken the nation to the  environmental dangers that inevitably accompany major oil drilling programs,  the ""Group of 10"" major environmental organizations said in a statement. Bush's  plan for ""environmentally prudent"" drilling in the wildlife reserve is a  contradiction in terms, they said, and they asked for a new study to be made of  the full environmental impact of drilling.    ""We find no independent scientists who say you can develop the Arctic coastal  plain in an environmentally prudent way,"" said former Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord  Nelson, who now heads the Wilderness Society.    The environmental groups called on Bush to ask the National Academy of Sciences  to conduct the new impact study, noting that Bush already has ordered such a  review of drilling off two sections of the California coast.    Although Administration officials argue that the oil from the wildlife area is  needed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports, environmental  advocates argue that energy conservation measures, such as increasing the fuel  efficiency of new cars, could have the same impact.    Environmentalists have made a long series of objections to drilling in the  reserve, which is the principal calving area for 180,000 migratory caribou and  a breeding ground for 300,000 geese and millions of shore birds.    In addition to the risk of further tanker accidents, they charge that noise and  exploration activity could disrupt wildlife and toxic drilling muds and other  wastes could seriously pollute the areas around the wells.    ""No matter how many precautions are taken, the unthinkable can still happen,""  said Lisa Speer, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.  ""The only way to keep the unthinkable from happening in environmentally  sensitive areas is to keep oil development out.""    While arguments escalated about future policy, Administration officials  continued to try to sort out an appropriate government response to the spill.    Administration officials said that the review team is not likely to recommend a  federal takeover, preferring the current system in which Exxon is directly  paying the costs of removing the oil from the waters and shores of Prince  William Sound.    The company has said that it would cover the full cost of the cleanup, but an  Exxon spokesman Tuesday indicated that the company probably would seek  reimbursement from a special industry fund to cover at least some of its costs.  Under the legislation that first set up the Alaska pipeline system a decade  ago, each of the seven oil companies drilling in Alaska agreed to pay up to $14  million for any cleanup costs. In addition, the companies agreed to set up a  fund to cover up to an additional $86 million in damages for any oil spill.    If cleanup costs and damages exceed $100 million, however, extensive litigation  to establish company negligence might be necessary to obtain more money. In  1978, for example, the Amoco Cadiz, a supertanker owned by Amoco Corp., went  aground on the coast of France during a gale, creating a spill six times larger  than the current Alaska spill. The final damages in that case, about $117  million, were only established last month by a federal judge in Chicago who has  continued to preside over the case despite having retired in the years it has  dragged on.    In part because of that problem, Transportation Department officials said  Tuesday that a government takeover of the clean-up effort would occur only if  Exxon appears unable to handle the task. The federal government would not be  eager to pay the bill until the matter was resolved.

Bush summoned Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, Environmental  Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost  to the Oval Office for an early morning meeting before sending them to Alaska  to ""take a hard look at where this disaster stands.""    Bush said after the session that he had received ""conflicting reports"" on the  progress that Exxon Corp. had made in containing the spill. ""I don't want to  prejudge that,"" he said, asking the top-level team to report back to him on  what additional steps may be needed.    Those steps could include federal civil penalties against Exxon, Skinner said.  The Coast Guard, which is leading federal efforts to combat the spill, will be  responsible for deciding whether Exxon violated federal regulations in its  operation of the oil tanker that struck a reef and ruptured, causing the huge  oil slick. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said that Justice Department lawyers also  will monitor the situation.    With Exxon officials now admitting that the cleanup so far has gone poorly,  Bush said that a federal takeover of the effort is ""an option"" that Skinner,  Reilly and Yost would assess. Under that approach, which Administration  officials currently consider unlikely, the government would pay for the cleanup  and then seek reimbursement from the company. Federal disaster relief officials  Tuesday also were reviewing a request from Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper for  additional federal emergency aid.    Despite the attention generated by the scope of the spill -- the largest in  U.S. history and one of the worst ever -- Bush said he felt no need to review  his Administration's plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil  drilling. ""I see no connection"" between drilling in the reserve and the  contamination in Prince William Sound, Bush said.    Environmentalists, however, who have been battling the drilling plan for  several years, lost no time in making a connection. Opening up the wildlife  reserve to drilling, they stressed, would greatly increase oil shipping along  the tanker route from the port of Valdez through Prince William Sound, the  formerly pristine waterway fouled by about 10 million gallons of oil since the  Exxon Valdez accident Friday.    The oil spill is a ""giant alarm clock"" that should awaken the nation to the  environmental dangers that inevitably accompany major oil drilling programs,  the ""Group of 10"" major environmental organizations said in a statement. Bush's  plan for ""environmentally prudent"" drilling in the wildlife reserve is a  contradiction in terms, they said, and they asked for a new study to be made of  the full environmental impact of drilling.    ""We find no independent scientists who say you can develop the Arctic coastal  plain in an environmentally prudent way,"" said former Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord  Nelson, who now heads the Wilderness Society.    The environmental groups called on Bush to ask the National Academy of Sciences  to conduct the new impact study, noting that Bush already has ordered such a  review of drilling off two sections of the California coast.    Although Administration officials argue that the oil from the wildlife area is  needed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports, environmental  advocates argue that energy conservation measures, such as increasing the fuel  efficiency of new cars, could have the same impact.    Environmentalists have made a long series of objections to drilling in the  reserve, which is the principal calving area for 180,000 migratory caribou and  a breeding ground for 300,000 geese and millions of shore birds.    In addition to the risk of further tanker accidents, they charge that noise and  exploration activity could disrupt wildlife and toxic drilling muds and other  wastes could seriously pollute the areas around the wells.    ""No matter how many precautions are taken, the unthinkable can still happen,""  said Lisa Speer, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.  ""The only way to keep the unthinkable from happening in environmentally  sensitive areas is to keep oil development out.""    While arguments escalated about future policy, Administration officials  continued to try to sort out an appropriate government response to the spill.    Administration officials said that the review team is not likely to recommend a  federal takeover, preferring the current system in which Exxon is directly  paying the costs of removing the oil from the waters and shores of Prince  William Sound.    The company has said that it would cover the full cost of the cleanup, but an  Exxon spokesman Tuesday indicated that the company probably would seek  reimbursement from a special industry fund to cover at least some of its costs.  Under the legislation that first set up the Alaska pipeline system a decade  ago, each of the seven oil companies drilling in Alaska agreed to pay up to $14  million for any cleanup costs. In addition, the companies agreed to set up a  fund to cover up to an additional $86 million in damages for any oil spill.    If cleanup costs and damages exceed $100 million, however, extensive litigation  to establish company negligence might be necessary to obtain more money. In  1978, for example, the Amoco Cadiz, a supertanker owned by Amoco Corp., went  aground on the coast of France during a gale, creating a spill six times larger  than the current Alaska spill. The final damages in that case, about $117  million, were only established last month by a federal judge in Chicago who has  continued to preside over the case despite having retired in the years it has  dragged on.    In part because of that problem, Transportation Department officials said  Tuesday that a government takeover of the clean-up effort would occur only if  Exxon appears unable to handle the task. The federal government would not be  eager to pay the bill until the matter was resolved.    ""At the moment it seems both unwise and unlikely, unless something happens that  changes our mind,"" a senior Transportation Department official said.      Map, OIL DRILLING SITE?

The answer, of course, is that they needn't. But do not try telling that to a railwayman or his friends. For as long as anyone can remember, railways have been run as vertically integrated operations; and that, as far as the railwayman is concerned, is the way they should stay. Thus Geoffrey Freeman Allen, as good a friend as the railways ever had, gets fired up to boiling point over Britain's plan to separate track from trains as part of the privatisation of British Rail. 'It will be astonishing . . . if any Continental European government, let alone its railway, views this as better than a dogma-driven exercise, utterly irrelevant to national need of a well-balanced multi-modal transport system, and a damper of any further technological exploration of rail transport's potential,' he says in his foreword to Jane's World Railways. It is a forlorn cry, and one that scarcely rings true: for as Mr Freeman Allen is obliged to acknowledge, the reality is that separating tracks from trains is catching on all over Europe. The Swedes, the Swiss and the Austrians have already done it, and the Germans, the Dutch and the Italians are planning it. For many (as for Britain), the long-term intention is to open up the tracks to private sector train operators in an attempt to inject competition, enterprise, innovation and investment into the industry. Huffing and puffing apart, however, this volume remains an indispensably handy guide to the world's railway industry. Perhaps what is really worrying Mr Freeman Allen is how long it will remain so; for if European governments' plans really do succeed in creating a golden age for the railways, the proliferation of entries for new track and train operators may lead to the need for a wheelbarrow to carry it around.

Exxon reported net income of Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars 1.07 a share, down from Dollars 2.24bn, or Dollars 1.78, in the same period of 1991. However, Mr Lawrence Rawl, Exxon's chairman, noted that net income had been up more than 20 per cent from the Dollars 1.12bn recorded in the 'more typical' fourth quarter, in spite of lower crude realisations, a weak US market for natural gas and softer economic conditions in many markets. He said the results had benefited from stronger natural gas sales in Europe, improved earnings from worldwide chemicals operations, overseas tax credits and asset sales. Operating volumes were strong, with liquids production, natural gas production, refinery runs, petroleum product sales and chemical sales all higher than in the first quarter of last year. US exploration and production made Dollars 125m, down from Dollars 150m, while foreign production earned Dollars 785m, up from Dollars 721m. Refining and marketing profits slumped from Dollars 256m to Dollars 23m in the US, and from Dollars 1.097bn to Dollars 450m abroad. Chemicals saw profits dip from Dollars 123m to Dollars 87m in the US and from Dollars 100m to Dollars 63m abroad. Texaco reported net income of Dollars 200m, or 68 cents, compared to Dollars 415m, or Dollars 1.51, in the first period of 1991. Revenues dipped from Dollars 10.2bn to Dollars 8.6bn due to lower prices, offset only slightly by higher sales volumes for refined products. Mr James Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive, said world economic weakness had lessened demand for crude oil and petroleum products, with a 15 per cent drop in crude prices since the first quarter of last year. He said Texaco intended to maintain its strong financial position and was reducing its planned capital expenditure for the year by 10 per cent. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum, the Los Angeles based group undergoing a broad restructuring, reported net income of Dollars 98m, or 32 cents a share, down from Dollars 136m, or 45 cents, in the first quarter of last year.

But Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said the company's plans depend on the outcome of an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is due to make its report by the end of July. By the end of this year, British Gas plans to cut around 4,000 jobs in its UK gas business division - about 1,000 more than previously planned - and just over 1,200 among its headquarters staff. The cost-cutting move is being prompted by a squeeze on British Gas's profits from a price cap on household sales and the growth of competition in the industrial and commercial market. Competition and regulatory pressure led to a Pounds 75m reduction in first-quarter profits on sales in the UK, but this was largely offset by lower gas purchase costs and growth in British Gas's overseas operations. Overall, first-quarter profits slipped by Pounds 8m to Pounds 650m after the exploration and production division showed a Pounds 60m increase in profit to Pounds 175m. The UK gas business reported a drop in profit to Pounds 743m from Pounds 789m. Mr Brown said the MMC report would have an important effect on future profitability: 'The ability for the company to expand and prosper depends on getting a fair reward for investment. The alternative is a damaging squeeze on profits.' He said that if the household supply market were opened up to competition, some customers would gain price savings of as much as 15 per cent. But British Gas estimates that only 6m - a third - of its customers would gain and 12m households would end up paying more, some as much as 90 per cent more. In an effort to encourage competitors into the market for high-volume, low price sales - the so-called interruptible market - British Gas is discussing setting up peak sales trading. This would help rivals to balance supply and demand by providing a marketplace for excess gas where large users could buy cheap supplies.

Not only will the mines produce more than 6 per cent of the world's mined copper requirements, the project will also place Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold, which owns them, among the very few companies with gold output above 1m troy ounces a year. The expansion will boost gold production to between 1.2m and 1.5m troy ounces. Freeport said yesterday the project would be completed by the middle of 1996 and, as its cash reserves would be about Dollars 400m by the end of this year, it would mainly be financed from its own resources. The Ertzberg-Grasberg mines have been under constant expansion since 1989. A Dollars 504m scheme which lifted ore processed from 20,000 to 57,000 tonnes a day had scarcely been completed before a further expansion to 66,000 tonnes was announced. The Indonesian company, which is 74.2 per cent owned by Freeport McMoRan, the New Orleans-based natural resources group, said yesterday that the expansion to 66,000 tonnes should be completed in the second half of 1993 at a cost of Dollars 90m. The cost of the proposed expansion to 90,000 tonnes of ore a day does not not include about Dollars 175m for infrastructure work because Freeport expects to sell some of the houses and shops to be included. Mr George Mealey, president of Freeport Copper, said that based on present reserves, the mines would have a 23-year life at a 90,000 tonnes-a-day rate. However, an aggressive exploration programme is continuing and the company expected to find much more copper and gold nearby. The expansion programme still has to be approved by the Indonesian government and is subject to an environmental impact assessment. However, if it is completed, it will put Indonesia ahead of Zambia, which mined about 423,000 tonnes of copper last year, as the world's third-largest producer (but still well behind Chile, 1.8m tonnes, and the US, 1.7m tonnes).  ------------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------ Aluminium      -2,900  to  1,338,500 Copper           +650  to    262,975 Lead           +2,775  to    153,325 Nickel           +228  to     42,960 Zinc             -450  to    347,675 Tin               -65  to     14,585  ------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

The two companies said that they planned to erect a pilot recovery plant in the area early next year to analyse a bulk sample of between 5,000 and 10,000 tonnes of ore. Depending on the results, these tests would be followed by a full feasibility study for a mine. Lac de Gras is just below the Arctic Circle, about 320 km (200 miles) north-east of Yellowknife, the territories' capital. The decision to go ahead with such a large sampling programme is based on the results of drilling last winter which appear to confirm a sizeable diamond deposit. Analysts at Pacific International Securities in Vancouver said yesterday that the grade of ore recovered from one of four kimberlite pipes at Lac de Gras 'puts it into the league of world-class diamond pipes'. Despite such enthusiasm, Dia-Met's shares tumbled by CDollars 9 to CDollars 57 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. The share price had tripled in the past year in anticipation of positive results from Lac de Gras. According to BHP and Dia-Met, a total of 206 carats were recovered from just over 400 tonnes of ore extracted from the four pipes. The results include only stones with a diameter of more than half a millimetre. The companies said that they had found several gem diamonds in the one to three carat range. The proportion of gem diamonds ranged from a low of 6 per cent in pipe number two to 31 per cent in pipe four and 33 per cent in pipe three. Pipe four contains a grade of 17.5 gem carats per 100 tonnes. Pacific International estimates that this is nearly double the grade indicated by a sample recovered from the nearby Point Lake property in late 1991 which set off the diamond stampede in the Northwest Territories. Meanwhile, the Canadian government has announced changes in income tax rules to encourage diamond exploration. Developers of diamond mines will in future be entitled to accelerated depreciation of capital costs, while exploration companies will be able to finance their work by means of 'flow-through' shares which offer substantial tax benefits to investors.

0," LA050690-0114   214852    May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition      Book Review; Page 12; Book Review Desk      1123 words      THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: THE ECOLOGY OF YOUTHFUL MINDS      By Kimberly Olson Fakih, Fakih, whose critical guide to children's books will  be published next year, is a free-lance editor and book reviewer.      In their concern for the environment, parents and publishers, like tardy  teachers on the way to class, are hurriedly unpacking instructive lesson books  and serviceable charts in the hallowed cause of making the next generation  responsible keepers of the Earth.    Perhaps in this context the ecology of children's minds should be just as valid  and hallowed an issue, if only as ground to be prepared for the future. Since  the time when Hilaire Belloc danced, trod and trampled on the cautionary tale,  the moralizing approach that used to strip-mine the children's book vein has  ceased, and this is no time to resurrect it.    As it stands, the only firm rule of the game, intended never to be broken, is  to root out and abolish preaching -- because if adults don't, children will.  When it comes to The Issues, all the classroom interrogations, bandwagon  slogans, ""don'ts,"" ""ought to's"" and various other smarmy messages that kids  love to hate may be lost on their intended audience faster than bumper stickers  on cars speeding down billboard-studded highways.    The best so-called ecology books, then, don't offer children ""Keep Off the  Grass"" signs but foster a regard for fragile, budding nature and tender shoots  of information. If this regard is tended, it may grow with the child, not as a  list of rigid moral imperatives but as a code of mutual coexistence with all  and sundry in our one dwelling place.    Maybe it's asking too much of a book to replicate a child's experience of  listening to the sobering cry of a loon rising off a lake, or viewing a male  emperor penguin peering at his newly hatched young. But even if only within the  span of a few illustrated pages, there is no substitute for the precognitive,  nonverbal communication that takes place when a child gazes back at a creature  of the wild. Such pictures cultivate in children neither pity nor fear toward  the environment and its inhabitants, but give them the chance to see in  nature's survival or destruction their own destiny. The next generation may yet  find out that man is not, after all, the measure of all things.    All the books in this survey, ennobled by their sincerity, aim to communicate  to the best of their abilities. Some are imperfect, beleaguered by their  missions. Others use the ever-welcome gentle touch and circumspection; these  (happily, a majority) do not see in children another frontier for willful  conditioning and are not anxious to endow them with the imprint of civilized  man.    Despite its awkward message, Hey! Get Off Our Train (Crown: $14.95;  unpaginated) shows that John Burningham, at least as an illustrator, is at his  peak. His familiar landscapes, comical and loose-lined, give way to  coal-country, soot-colored skies and impressionistic vistas of a sojourn by  train. But Burningham's usual rebelliousness, so enticing to his regular  readers, in this book turns to pedantry. A boy commandeers a train through a  lesson-filled dream time. One by one, endangered animals expound on why their  days are numbered as they seek passage on the train.    A similar burden of soap-box oratory undermines the unmistakable worth of The  Great Kapok Tree by Lynne Cherry (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $14.95;  unpaginated), whose other illustrations (including those in books for the World  Wildlife Fund series on endangered animals) have been moral-free. Splendid  paintings in tropical colors accompany the story of a young man sent into the  rain forest to chop down a Kapok tree. After a carefully choreographed pelting  of pleas by various animals, the man's eyes are opened: He tosses down his ax  -- perhaps to the detriment of the carpenters' guilds, but environmental  concerns take precedence over all here -- and walks away.    In Barbara Juster Esbensen's Great Northern Diver: The Loon, illustrated by  Mary Barrett Brown (Little, Brown: $14.95; 32 pp.), readers meet a graceful  bird, clumsy only on takeoff, who hits airborne speeds of 60 m.p.h. The author  sets forth a straightforward rendering of facts and refers to the need for  loons' solitude in one slim sentence: ""On a hidden lake there is little chance  of being disturbed by motorboats coming close to the nest."" After the loons  migrate, the sky darkens and the nest fills with snow. It's a sorrowful sight,  that empty home, similar to the hollow cabins that line frozen lakes through  winter.    Jan Thornhill's The Wildlife ABC (Simon & Schuster: $14.95; unpaginated)  never preaches an ecological cause but tantalizes children first with light  verse accompanying an ABC listing of animals (similar to the author's ""The  Wildlife l-2-3"") and then with a section of ""Nature Notes"" full of intriguing  facts: ""A is for Auk/who lives by the sea"" is later shored up by a poignant  description of the last of the Great Auks. The woodcut-like portraits abound  with humorous, human touches; Thornhill includes people in her pictures, taking  wildlife out of a remote realm and depicting it as close as a housefly  dive-bombing the refrigerator.

In their concern for the environment, parents and publishers, like tardy  teachers on the way to class, are hurriedly unpacking instructive lesson books  and serviceable charts in the hallowed cause of making the next generation  responsible keepers of the Earth.    Perhaps in this context the ecology of children's minds should be just as valid  and hallowed an issue, if only as ground to be prepared for the future. Since  the time when Hilaire Belloc danced, trod and trampled on the cautionary tale,  the moralizing approach that used to strip-mine the children's book vein has  ceased, and this is no time to resurrect it.    As it stands, the only firm rule of the game, intended never to be broken, is  to root out and abolish preaching -- because if adults don't, children will.  When it comes to The Issues, all the classroom interrogations, bandwagon  slogans, ""don'ts,"" ""ought to's"" and various other smarmy messages that kids  love to hate may be lost on their intended audience faster than bumper stickers  on cars speeding down billboard-studded highways.    The best so-called ecology books, then, don't offer children ""Keep Off the  Grass"" signs but foster a regard for fragile, budding nature and tender shoots  of information. If this regard is tended, it may grow with the child, not as a  list of rigid moral imperatives but as a code of mutual coexistence with all  and sundry in our one dwelling place.    Maybe it's asking too much of a book to replicate a child's experience of  listening to the sobering cry of a loon rising off a lake, or viewing a male  emperor penguin peering at his newly hatched young. But even if only within the  span of a few illustrated pages, there is no substitute for the precognitive,  nonverbal communication that takes place when a child gazes back at a creature  of the wild. Such pictures cultivate in children neither pity nor fear toward  the environment and its inhabitants, but give them the chance to see in  nature's survival or destruction their own destiny. The next generation may yet  find out that man is not, after all, the measure of all things.    All the books in this survey, ennobled by their sincerity, aim to communicate  to the best of their abilities. Some are imperfect, beleaguered by their  missions. Others use the ever-welcome gentle touch and circumspection; these  (happily, a majority) do not see in children another frontier for willful  conditioning and are not anxious to endow them with the imprint of civilized  man.    Despite its awkward message, Hey! Get Off Our Train (Crown: $14.95;  unpaginated) shows that John Burningham, at least as an illustrator, is at his  peak. His familiar landscapes, comical and loose-lined, give way to  coal-country, soot-colored skies and impressionistic vistas of a sojourn by  train. But Burningham's usual rebelliousness, so enticing to his regular  readers, in this book turns to pedantry. A boy commandeers a train through a  lesson-filled dream time. One by one, endangered animals expound on why their  days are numbered as they seek passage on the train.    A similar burden of soap-box oratory undermines the unmistakable worth of The  Great Kapok Tree by Lynne Cherry (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $14.95;  unpaginated), whose other illustrations (including those in books for the World  Wildlife Fund series on endangered animals) have been moral-free. Splendid  paintings in tropical colors accompany the story of a young man sent into the  rain forest to chop down a Kapok tree. After a carefully choreographed pelting  of pleas by various animals, the man's eyes are opened: He tosses down his ax  -- perhaps to the detriment of the carpenters' guilds, but environmental  concerns take precedence over all here -- and walks away.    In Barbara Juster Esbensen's Great Northern Diver: The Loon, illustrated by  Mary Barrett Brown (Little, Brown: $14.95; 32 pp.), readers meet a graceful  bird, clumsy only on takeoff, who hits airborne speeds of 60 m.p.h. The author  sets forth a straightforward rendering of facts and refers to the need for  loons' solitude in one slim sentence: ""On a hidden lake there is little chance  of being disturbed by motorboats coming close to the nest."" After the loons  migrate, the sky darkens and the nest fills with snow. It's a sorrowful sight,  that empty home, similar to the hollow cabins that line frozen lakes through  winter.    Jan Thornhill's The Wildlife ABC (Simon & Schuster: $14.95; unpaginated)  never preaches an ecological cause but tantalizes children first with light  verse accompanying an ABC listing of animals (similar to the author's ""The  Wildlife l-2-3"") and then with a section of ""Nature Notes"" full of intriguing  facts: ""A is for Auk/who lives by the sea"" is later shored up by a poignant  description of the last of the Great Auks. The woodcut-like portraits abound  with humorous, human touches; Thornhill includes people in her pictures, taking  wildlife out of a remote realm and depicting it as close as a housefly  dive-bombing the refrigerator.    By creating an environment in which readers come to care for emperor and Adelie  penguins and Weddell seals, Helen Cowcher's Antarctica (Farrar, Straus &  Giroux: $13.95; unpaginated) conveys an affecting, subtle message about the  disturbance of habitat.

0,FT933-10146 ,"FT933-10146 _AN-DHECDAE4FT 930805   FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Li Ka-shing starts to crack the whip at Husky Oil - Management changes have brought a mood of optimism at the Calgary group      By BERNARD SIMON   SIX years and several hundred million dollars of losses after his first foray into the North American energy industry, Mr Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire, has quietly begun cracking the whip at Calgary's Husky Oil. His determination to improve Husky's performance was signalled clearly last month with the typically low-key replacement of Husky's Canadian chief executive by an expatriate parachuted into the senior management ranks 18 months earlier from Hong Kong. The new chief executive, Mr John Lau, has worked for the Li group for 10 years and is described by a former colleague as a 'fixer'. Mr Lau says 'there won't be substantial differences' under his stewardship. But the mere fact the former chief executive, Mr Arthur Price, has been moved at the age of 41 to become a 'special adviser' to another Li company suggests a new era is dawning at Husky. Mr Lau has already made an impression as a decisive executive, spearheading the latest of several cost-cutting exercises. His authority is reinforced by the presence of Mrs PC Koh, who was also brought in from Hong Kong last year as vice-president in charge of, among other things, strategic planning. 'Certainly, there are going to be changes,' says one person with an intimate knowledge of the company. He predicts a 'battening-down of the hatches' and a sweeping reorganisation which may include the disposal of Husky's offshore interests in Libya, Indonesia and Vietnam. The volatile North American oil and gas industry has been a big headache for Mr Li. Over the past two years, Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li, has taken write-offs totalling HKDollars 2.2bn (USDollars 283.9m) on its 49 per cent stake in Husky. But Mr Li has so far shown no sign of backing away from his investment. On the contrary, various family-controlled companies have raised their original 52 per cent stake, bought in 1987, to 95 per cent in 1991. This includes Hutchison Whampoa's stake. The remaining 5 per cent is owned by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Li companies have subsequently poured several hundred million dollars of new equity into Husky. Mr Price, who still works out of Husky's head office, insists there is no intention for the time being of joining the stampede among Canadian energy companies to tap the equity markets for funds. Mr Ian Doig, publisher of an oil industry newsletter in Calgary, says Mr Li 'got taken to the cleaners' with his initial CDollars 484m (USDollars 378m) investment in Husky. But based on the price Husky received for various oil and gas properties which it sold recently, Mr Doig says that Mr Li 'is starting to recover some of his initial losses.' Such upbeat comments reflect a widespread impression that, while Husky's problems are by no means over, its fortunes are more likely to improve than deteriorate over the next few years. Husky declines to reveal any sales or earnings figures, but a look at its businesses suggests its shareholders will be getting both good and bad news this year. Husky has benefited from a surge in North American natural gas prices. But these gains are at least partly offset by the depressed sulphur market, caused by worldwide over-supply. Husky is one of Canada's biggest sulphur producers. The news is also mixed from the newly-commissioned Lloydminster heavy oil upgrader on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. The upgrader's construction and financing have pre-occupied Husky for almost a decade. Husky has a 27 per cent stake in the CDollars 1.6bn project, which processes tar-like heavy oil into 46,000 barrels a day of synthetic light crude. From a technical point of view, the long-delayed upgrader is performing splendidly, but the narrowing price differential between heavy and light crude oil has severely eroded its financial performance. Husky and its partners - the Alberta, Saskatchewan and federal governments - were hoping for a gap averaging CDollars 8 to CDollars 9 a barrel. But strong demand for heavy oil coupled with the sliding price of light crude has squeezed margins, narrowing the spread to less than CDollars 5. The damage to Husky will be limited, provided the depressed margins do not last too long. The company has long had a reputation as one of the Canadian oil industry's most politically influential players. The upgrader deal obliges the government shareholders to absorb the bulk of any losses in the early years of operation, or to hand over to Husky more than its proportionate share of profits. However, one of Husky's partners also expresses concern about the upgrader's longer-term economics, saying that price forecasts made in the early days of construction in 1988 may no longer be realistic. Optimism about Husky's future is based largely on its decision several years ago to focus on natural gas and heavy oil. It withdrew from light-crude exploration in 1987, and has consolidated its remaining oil and gas properties, in the process raising about CDollars 600m from asset disposals. Much of its exploration and development effort is now concentrated in the Rockies foothills, west of Calgary. Mr Price claims Husky's gas properties are 'about the best in the business' measured by quality of reserves and development costs. Mr Lau and Mr Price refuse to comment on rumours that Husky's drills have struck a vast reservoir in the foothills. But they do predict that the benefits of work being done now will show up in the company's financial performance over the next three to five years. Perhaps the most telling sign that Mr Li's investment may at last be paying off is the recent acquisition by several other prominent Hong Kong entrepreneurs of Westcoast Petroleum, another western Canadian oil and gas producer. Outsiders suspect these investors would not have made their move without a quiet word from Mr Li that things were starting to look up in Calgary.   Companies:-  Husky Oil.

They and dozens of other remote areas figure prominently in the 'frontier strategies' under which a growing number of companies are ranging beyond their traditional operating areas. But the focus on trying to find very large oil and gas fields in frontier areas has diverted attention from a surge of renewed interest in mature regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. Advances in both exploration and production technology combined with the desire to maximise the heavy investment in the infrastructure of such areas is driving the trend. It has been most evident in the past year in the Gulf of Mexico, where oil production began more than 40 years ago. Exploration of the area dropped sharply in the late 1980s as some of the bigger companies began to look abroad for new reserves. But buoyant US natural gas prices have attracted a large number of independent companies to the region. Their success rate has been enhanced by their ability to gain relatively cheap access to three-dimensional seismic data. This technique, combined with the much greater power of the latest generation of computers, has enabled geologists to 'see' through structures such as salt domes. These structures had blocked views derived from the earlier two-dimensional seismic techniques. The new seismic technology has also helped in the discovery of smaller satellite fields close to existing platforms. Many of these can then be tapped by horizontal drilling from an existing platform. The technique can reach reservoirs as far away as 6km, eliminating in many cases the need and cost of building a new platform. Other new technology, such as tension leg platforms, is allowing companies to move into deeper water. The Mars field, described by Shell and British Petroleum as the largest discovery in the Gulf of Mexico for the past 20 years, lies in 2,933 feet of water. Technology has also played a key role in maintaining production in the North Sea where early fields such as Ekofisk, off Norway, and Brent and Forties in the UK are being re-engineered to prolong their production life. The re-engineering of the Brent field, the UK's largest oil producer, by Shell and Esso, includes a shift in emphasis to gas production. The work, which will cost Pounds 1.3bn and take five years to complete, will add 10 years to the field's production life. Mr John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration, believes the life of North Sea production could extend well into the next century 'even if prices never rise again in real terms'. He says that new technology could push recovery rates as high as 70 per cent of reserves within 20 years, compared with the 50-55 per cent achieved in only a few fields at present. Companies are only now beginning to realise the full scope for cost reductions in the North Sea. The UK Offshore Operators Association, whose membership includes all 36 companies producing oil and gas in the UK sector of the North Sea, believes savings of up to 30 per cent in capital costs of offshore platforms could be made if more attention was given to standardisation of designs and equipment. A recent report contained a series of recommendations detailing new codes and practices. It predicted that substantial cost savings were possible within two or three years if the basic proposals were implemented. Mr Browne believes that a 30 per cent cut in capital costs and a 50 per cent cut in operating costs over the next 20 years 'could raise the total volume recoverable from the North Sea by 25 per cent - from around 60bn barrels of oil equivalent to around 75bn'. The way in which technology and higher productivity can prolong the life of mature areas is unlikely, however, to lead to any sharp falloff in oil company interest in frontier areas. But their sheer distance from the world's main markets and lack of local infrastructure make them a long-term proposition. China's Tarim basin, for example, is 2,500 miles from the coast. Studies suggest it could cost as much as Dollars 6 to move a barrel of oil through a proposed pipeline to China's main markets. A similar level of transportation charges is likely in other promising but landlocked areas, such as Kazakhstan. The political uncertainty surrounding the future of such countries and the need to move oil or gas across sometimes unfriendly borders complicates their development, even if the per barrel cost of producing oil or gas is attractive. The growing competition among countries for foreign investment to help develop their petroleum resources is also likely to exert a strong influence on where oil companies look next. Much of the interest in the world's more remote areas can be traced to the withdrawal or exclusion of many western oil companies from Middle Eastern and Latin American countries as a result of nationalisation. There is no prospect that the old concession system in the Middle East will be revived, but some of the barriers to western oil companies in the region are being lowered. There were reports this year that Kuwait was discussing exploration prospects with western companies, while French companies in particular are positioning themselves to take advantage of opportunities in Iraq once United Nations sanctions are lifted. The prospect that western oil companies could become more deeply involved in the Middle East in years to come has been boosted by the fact that many countries in the region cannot afford to develop on their own the new reserves needed to maintain, let alone enlarge, their capacity. The relatively low cost of much oil in the area has obvious appeal to western companies, but the political risks of the region remain relatively high despite the peace agreement between Palestinians and the Israelis.

Operations at the group's rail, road and marine transport units remained depressed, but the thriving PanCanadian Petroleum oil and gas subsidiary doubled its contribution. Forest product losses were much lower, while property and hotels improved. Mr William Stinson, chairman, said that 'slowly improving economic conditions together with rising efficiency should lead to a return to profitability in 1993'. CP posted a CDollars 2.7m (USDollars 2.1m) profit in the final quarter of 1992, against a loss of CDollars 29m a year earlier, but after special charges the final loss came out at CDollars 254m, or 80 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 887.6m, or CDollars 2.79, in 1991. Revenues were CDollars 2bn, compared with CDollars 2.5bn, but the decline was partly due to disposals. For the whole of 1992, the company posted a loss of CDollars 37.4m before special charges, against a loss of CDollars 16.2m a year earlier. The final loss rose to CDollars 478.3m, or CDollars 1.50 a share, against a deficit of CDollars 913.8m, or CDollars 2.87, in 1991. Revenues fell to CDollars 8.9bn from CDollars 10bn. The 1992 special charges covered continued rail and truck rationalisation and manpower cuts, and a write-down of CP's investment in its US industrial products associate. CP Rail performed poorly because of the recession. The western coal operations were hit by a strike, but have since been expanded by acquisition and should improve in 1993. Telecommunications were not profitable. The group's stake in Unitel Communications, the Canadian telecoms company, has dropped below 50 per cent following the CDollars 150m purchase by ATT of the US of a 20 per cent interest. PanCanadian, with sharply higher earnings from rising oil and gas production, is spending CDollars 430 m on exploration and development this year, up 2 per cent from 1992. CP Forest should return to profitability in the second half of 1993, while Marathon Realty's and CP Hotels' progress may be held back by the slow recovery.

0,FT942-1252 ,"FT942-1252 _AN-EFXC1AHBFT 940624   FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (11): Not much left on the shelf - Energy, the oil's running low, turn up the gas      By KAREN FOSSLI   The era of Norwegian 'elephant' size oil discoveries, as they are known in the industry, is over. While it is too early to write the country's obituary as an oil producer, there is little geological evidence that current levels of oil production can be sustained beyond the decade. Currently western Europe's biggest oil producer, with daily output of more than 2.4m barrels, Norway's ranking would have fallen behind Britain this year had the government not opened the oil taps full-bore, to compensate for a loss in revenue caused by weak oil prices and a weaker dollar. According to forecasts by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy consultant, crude oil production will hit 2.67m barrels a day this year and rise to 2.82m b/d in 1995, before peaking at a daily rate of 2.85m barrels in 1996. In 1993, the state's net petroleum revenue comprised slightly less than 10 per cent of total revenue, while petroleum exports accounted for one third of total exports, and related investments represented one third of total Norwegian investment. Petroleum also represented 15 per cent of GNP. Total capital expenditure in the offshore petroleum sector last year peaked at a record estimated NKr60bn, 7.5 per cent of GDP, and may have added substantially to mainland GDP, because oil equipment goods - production platforms in particular - are, for a large part, manufactured by land-based industry. But there is no immediate prospect of any new, significant oil discoveries being made on the Norwegian continental shelf. The last big discovery - Norne, made in 1986 - is expected to yield peak annual production of around 15m barrels of oil a year, just 12 per cent of that of the giant Statfjord field, discovered 20 years ago, at the dawn of Norway's oil age. The size of new discoveries is expected to diminish to an average 20m tonnes of oil equivalent, compared with 90m tonnes for fields now producing, and 40m tonnes for those currently being developed. Earlier this year, the government proposed a comprehensive overhaul of energy policy, and more recently scrapped immediate plans to sharpen petroleum taxes - both moves in a desperate attempt to stimulate petroleum activities to stem the awaited steep decline in oil output. In a white paper presented in March, the government called for exploration acreage to be expanded by 16 per cent, and for reform of rules for exploring in the Barents Sea, to make it more attractive. It also intends to speed up the process for approving oil discoveries for development, and a number of proposals have been made to streamline licensing rules and management of the state's oil and gas resources. Norway has little choice but to stimulate oil activity; not only is output set to decline dramatically, but stiff competition has emerged from oil regions elsewhere in the world vying for investment. For the first time in many years, foreign oil companies operating in Norway are having to fight for funds from headquarters to maintain investment. Several are even undertaking substantial streamlining operations, in which staff levels are being cut sharply. Earlier this year, the French oil company Total announced a strategic reorientation in which it closed its office in Stavanger, Norway's oil capital, retrenched to Oslo, cut staff from 150 to 100 - all to achieve annual cost savings of more than NKr20m. Total has also warned that interest in Norway's next licensing round, for which new acreage will be put on offer next year, will be kept at a minimum unless the country's draconian tax regime is realigned to reflect the reality of current oil prices. In Norway's 14th licensing round last year, both Esso and Shell refused to apply for high-risk acreage, and subsequently withdrew from bidding in protest against stringent operating conditions. Mobil recently announced that it would complete a reorganisation of its drilling department in August, after finishing its last well as operator. 'With no wells to drill, we cannot justify keeping together a drilling group sized as we are to drill wells and accomplish the myriad of other activities associated with being an active operator,' drilling manager Iain Montgomery told staff. Elf Aquitaine this month revealed plans for a dramatic reduction in staff in Stavanger, and numerous other oil companies are reluctant to embark on new development projects while oil prices remain weak and petroleum taxes high. Investment in the petroleum sector is expected to fall by 8 per cent this year, and will decline dramatically within the next two years unless oil companies commit to new projects. Last year, Norway boosted recoverable petroleum reserves by 259m tonnes of oil equivalent to 5.89bn tonnes, but the increase was due to adjustments to reserves of producing fields and discoveries not yet developed, rather than to exploration success. Out of a total of 18 wildcat explortion wells drilled in 1993, just three small discoveries were made, yielding only 9m tonnes. Optimists, however, point out that 60 per cent of the continental shelf has yet to be opened for exploration. What is certain is the success which Norway is achieving in the transition to becoming an important gas-producing nation. Its share of the western European gas market will soon reach 15 per cent. 'While our oil production will probably reach its zenith in the near future, the large investments in gas-field development will lead to a substantial increase in Norway's gas production from 1995 to the year 2000,' says Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister. Gas production is expected to reach as much as 70bn cubic metres by the turn of the century, while gas sales contracts already amount to more than 50bn cubic metres annually. More than half of western Europe's proven gas resources are found on Norway's continental shelf. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, believes that, while the 20th century was the age of oil, the 21st is set to become the gas era, particularly as concern for the environment becomes the driving force behind the growth of gas consumption.

0,FT942-13179 ,"FT942-13179 _AN-EDZEDAFRFT 940426   FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: First-quarter income drops 28% at Texaco      By PATRICK HARVERSON      NEW YORK   Texaco, the US oil group, yesterday reported a 28 per cent decline in consolidated first-quarter net income to Dollars 202m, or 69 cents a share, as sharply lower crude oil prices offset efficiency improvements, costs reductions and increased oil production levels. The group's quarterly earnings were restated to account for the sale of Texaco Chemical to Huntsman Corporation, concluded last week. If income from the chemical operation was included in the results, Texaco would have earned Dollars 278m in the quarter, still slightly below last year's profit of Dollars 281m. Upstream exploration and production earnings were almost halved to Dollars 120m in the wake of declines in crude oil prices of more than Dollars 4 per barrel in the US market, and more than Dollars 3 per barrel internationally. However, upstream earnings were buoyed by an increase in natural gas prices. Earnings from downstream manufacturing and marketing operations, which traditionally benefit from cheaper oil, rose to Dollars 203m, up from Dollars 171m a year earlier. The group said margins rose in the US market, where the introduction of its new CleanSystem gasoline product boosted domestic sales. Downstream earnings overseas were lifted by increased sales in Latin America and higher margins in Brazil. Capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter rose 17 per cent to Dollars 624m as overall spending on both upstream and downstream operations increased, particularly on drilling on developmental gas projects in the US. Overseas upstream expenditures fell, primarily because successful project completions in the North Sea oilfields continue to feed through into higher production volumes. Although corporate overheads were lower in the quarter, higher after-tax interest expenses pushed up corporate and non-operating expenses from Dollars 99m to Dollars 120m. The results had little impact on Texaco's share price, which rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 65 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Atlantic Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based energy group, yesterday reported a 43 per cent decline in first-quarter profits to Dollars 149m or 92 cents a share from Dollars 260m or Dollars 1.60 a year earlier. Revenues tumbled to Dollars 3.9bn from Dollars 4.67bn. The company blamed the sharp drop in earnings on lower crude oil prices. Arco's downstream refining and marketing operations, however, put in a solid performance, thanks partly to higher natural gas prices.   Companies:-  Texaco Inc.

0," LA081390-0025   261004    August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 1; Column 5; Foreign Desk      2489 words      POLICY ON OIL: A CONTINUING U.S. DILEMMA      By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Risky though the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait is for Western economies, some say  the military confrontation might stand as a mere dress rehearsal for a true oil  crisis that could be far harder to defuse.    The real oil crunch draws closer every day that the world's reliance on oil  from the unstable Middle East grows, these oil watchers say -- a dependence  that has reversed course and climbed dramatically in the last five years.    A steep fall in oil prices that began in late 1985 has made oil more attractive  to use but less rewarding to produce, with the result that demand is up and  production outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is flat.  Thus, the daily appetite for OPEC oil has surged by nearly 50% since then, to  23 million barrels.    In this country, domestic oil output has tumbled to a 29-year low, and imports  of crude have jumped to 50% of consumption -- most of it from OPEC nations --  surpassing the previous high of 45% that prevailed at the time of the 1979 oil  shock. Already the world's oil nations are producing about 90% of the oil they  can, the highest percentage since 1973. And the only nations whose oil output  can be significantly expanded are members of the fractious OPEC cartel, whose  hand is thus growing stronger by the day.    These conditions are widely seen as a recipe for rising oil prices and all the  ills that can result.    ""This one is military,"" says analyst Daniel Dreyfus of the Gas Research  Institute and former staff director of the Senate Energy Committee, referring  to the crisis caused by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. ""The next one will be  economic. It won't take an invasion.""    The invasion has already renewed the familiar debate over U.S. energy policy,  which critics consider to be almost non-existent.    Various segments of the energy industry have proposed a floor on oil prices,  greater access to public land for drilling, dollar incentives to capture more  oil from old fields, a new generation of nuclear reactors, subsidizing oil  exploration in foreign countries friendly to the United States, more federal  funds for energy research and getting clean-coal technology to market.    Consumer and environmental groups want stiffer auto gas-guzzler taxes and a  gas-sipper rebate, higher gasoline taxes, tougher efficiency standards for  motor vehicles, appliances and buildings, a ""carbon user's fee,"" protection of  public lands from drilling and research funds and subsidies for solar, wind and  other renewable forms of energy.    ""We have to look at the whole litany,"" says Philip Verleger Jr. at the  International Institute for Economics in Washington. ""We have to move in lots  of directions.""    But unless oil prices continue to climb, skeptics doubt that this latest  incident will trigger any lasting effort to cut usage, find more crude or wean  the nation from oil toward other fuels -- all of which carry a price tag.  History suggests that the public isn't willing to pay the price until a crisis  is upon it and the damage is done.    Says Dreyfus, ""If somebody assassinated Saddam (Hussein) tomorrow and his  troops staggered back to Baghdad, in two weeks you wouldn't even know it had  happened other than a few people making speeches, the same speeches they've  been making for 10 years.""    Nor is there unanimity that anything dramatic needs to be done. Advocates of  the free-market approach that has stood for U.S. energy policy over the past  decade say that -- given the reality of the Middle East's oil riches -- it has  served the nation well.    ""I frankly think the policy was right. It has avoided pain and cost for the  consumer,"" says Fereidun Fesharaki, once an oil adviser to the Shah of Iran who  heads energy research at the U.S. government-funded East-West Center in  Honolulu. ""We have to accept (the need for OPEC oil) and try to do things to  make sure their economies and ours have mutual interests.""    This predicted oil crunch down the road reflects the same geologic dilemma that  has helped to drive U.S. foreign policy since vast amounts of oil were  discovered in Saudi Arabia in the 1930s, just in time to fuel the world's  burgeoning fleet of cars, trucks and planes.    The Middle East holds about 70% of all known, economically recoverable crude  oil, not counting the old East Bloc nations. The fields are not only the  world's biggest but also the most prolific, the oil is the highest quality and  the cost of producing it is the cheapest.    That imbalance has steadily worsened as the United States, the world's biggest  user of oil, depleted its own once-plentiful reserves. The nation's reliance on  imported oil has since become one of the facts of life that define America's  place in the world.    This dependence has changed complexion from time to time, as oil strikes in  Mexico, China, Canada, Venezuela and other regions outside the Middle East  bolstered the big Alaska discovery of 1968 to help ease the U.S. vulnerability  to the political uncertainties of the Arab world.    But those were minor discoveries -- Alaska's biggest field has already begun  its natural decline -- compared to the oil riches of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,  Iraq, Iran and other Middle East members of OPEC, whose oil politics twice  rocked the Western economies in the 1970s.    The oil jolts of 1973 and 1979 reduced actual supplies by a relatively minor  amount, making them a particularly dramatic illustration of America's need for  other people's crude.    The six-month Arab oil embargo that began in October, 1973, removed an average  of less than 3% of the oil production from world markets while the Iranian  revolution in 1978-79 represented an average cutback of about 4%. By  comparison, today's blockade of Iraq and Kuwait is apparently costing up to 4.5  million barrels of crude per day -- roughly 8% of world production including  the old East Bloc.    The first energy shock bumped crude oil prices from $4 to $12 a barrel, the  second from $13 to $37. The dramatic events helped bring down the presidency of  Jimmy Carter, tore up the landscape with double-digit inflation and soaring  interest rates and triggered a deep worldwide recession that fundamentally  changed the industrialized economies.    But the energy shocks also generated a dramatic response, starting with fuel  economy standards for cars and extending to changes in the personal habits of  Americans. The government imposed conservation programs and subsidized new  industries to develop alternative forms of energy. While the oil industry got  rich from the high prices, it used some of the money to find more oil.    Conservation, fuel substitutions and the recession itself caused oil  consumption to plummet, while supplies surged. The need for imported oil was  reversed, undercutting the OPEC cartel. Prices began to slide in late 1981 and  inflation oozed out of the economy, giving way to the Reagan-era prosperity  that has continued into 1990.    But an outright price collapse at the end of 1985 unleashed forces that have  undone much of the progress on energy efficiency and slowly narrowed the gap  between the world's need for oil and ability to supply it, setting the stage  for the panicky run-up in oil and gasoline prices that greeted the invasion of  Kuwait.    As 1986 unfolded, the price for a 42-gallon barrel of oil nose-dived from $30  to as low as $9 a barrel, sowing the seeds for greater consumption of oil while  putting a damper on oil production and exploration. The low prices and a  free-market philosophy led the U.S. government to relax automotive fuel economy  standards, raise speed limits and dismantle non-nuclear energy research and  subsidy programs.    Meanwhile, thousands of U.S. oil wells were closed as unprofitable, and  industry exploration efforts tumbled. The remaining exploration outlays were  redirected toward the most promising overseas areas where there is often less  environmental opposition of the type that has kept oil producers out of the  Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and some offshore California regions.    The resulting big jump in imported oil entering the United States doesn't worry  everybody.    The Japanese and West German economies have thrived despite their almost total  reliance on imported oil. Free-market economists say Americans should sit back  and enjoy the imported crude because it is cheaper to produce than our own, and  thus save whatever reserves lie under Alaska and off the California shore to  use when foreign sources finally dry up. Meanwhile, the decontrol of prices  since the oil shocks of the 1970s will tend to self-correct the swings in oil  markets, driving down demand and boosting supplies when prices surge.    But many argue there is no free market in oil as long as OPEC is in operation,  withholding oil from the market to prop up prices, and as long as other  governments -- including Japan -- are in the business of subsidizing oil  exploration and development.    ""If the U.S. treated oil as a national security issue and supported oil  production in some way, U.S. production would be a lot higher than it is and  imports would be lower,"" says Joseph Story, a Washington consultant to  oil-producing nations who has long experience in the Middle East.    The 50% oil-import benchmark has been suggested by politicians such as Sen.  Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) as a ceiling for the United States on the grounds of  national security -- an argument bolstered by such incidents as the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait.    Such initiatives have attracted little support in recent years. But the  invasion of Kuwait, after the resurgence of the environment as a major issue in  the United States, could foster debate once again on longer-term energy  solutions.    Under President Bush, a former oilman who also considers himself an  environmentalist, congressional aides see a slight shift away from a Reagan  energy policy described as one of benign neglect. The Bush Administration  restored the maximum fuel economy standards for cars, for example, after the  requirements had been relaxed annually for several years.    ""They're talking a better game on conservation and efficiency, but they haven't  actually done much yet,"" says Jack Riggs, staff director for the House  subcommittee on energy and power.    Bush has ordered the Energy Department to propose options by next year for a  ""national energy strategy"" that would attempt to make sense out of various  contradictory federal policies.    But the Bush Administration made the familiar free-market argument in resisting  demands that the nation tap its 590-million-barrel strategic petroleum reserve  (SPR) to defuse last week's run-up in oil prices -- a position that has been  roundly criticized by the energy community.    ""It says a lot about energy policy,"" says Verleger, who argues that merely  declaring an intent to use the reserve would have undercut the sharp run-up in  gasoline prices. ""The petroleum reserve is the only significant element of our  energy policy, and the Administration didn't use it.""    For all the appeal of such renewable forms of energy as solar and wind power,  which are now being used to make electricity in Southern California, the nation  would have to cut into cars and trucks to make major inroads in oil  consumption. More than 60% of the oil consumed by the United States now goes  for transportation. Despite fuel-economy gains to date, cars and trucks alone  use up the equivalent of the entire output of the nation's oil fields.    One of the few things everybody agrees about is the virtue of natural gas,  which is plentiful and burns more cleanly than oil. It has been described as a  bridge fuel between the oil age and whatever comes after oil. But only a major  role for natural gas to fuel cars -- which is now being attempted on an  experimental basis -- would make a big dent in oil exploration.    Meanwhile, the use of oil to make electricity has been making a comeback  because it has become so cheap, undermining progress made by nuclear,  hydroelectric, natural gas, wind, solar and other cleaner and more plentiful  sources.    Just how much enthusiasm the nation could muster for another round of  investments in alternative energy is open to question. A rash of such ventures  subsidized by the federal government in the early 1980s later collapsed when  they either didn't work or couldn't compete with traditional fuels. It remains  to be seen whether many would take the plunge again unless oil prices climb  much higher than they have so far.    The biggest such undertaking was Unocal Corp.'s oil-shale project in Parachute  Creek, Colo., which has relied on federal price supports that guarantee a  whopping $45 for every barrel of oil that the company manages to squeeze out of  rocks. It has cost Unocal nearly $1 billion and the taxpayers up to $400  million.    Just as a continuation of this week's higher oil prices would tend to make the  economy use less oil, it should encourage oil companies to explore for more  oil. Today's leaner oil industry can find oil more cheaply and be profitable at  lower prices than it could before the mid-1980s price collapse.    The dramatic changes in the Soviet Union have raised hopes that an influx of  Western oil technology could sharply boost oil production there. But Fesharaki,  recently returned from the Soviet oil fields, says it will be decades before  declining production there can be reversed. Experts blame poor drilling  practices, deteriorating equipment, improper maintenance and antiquated  technology for the bleak outlook.    Geologists say that even the best luck in turning up new oil reserves in  Alaska, offshore California, the Far East, the Soviet Union and other promising  areas would not change the overwhelming dominance of the Middle East. The  region's control of an estimated 70% of the 808 billion barrels of oil left in  the world doesn't even include unexplored areas such as the world's only known  ""mega-province,"" in geologists' parlance. That alone is thought to exceed 700  billion barrels -- almost half of it Iraq's.    Already, the only significant oil nations not producing oil flat-out are  members of OPEC. Historically, the higher their share of world markets, the  greater their power over prices. And except for Venezuela and Nigeria, the only  ones that can readily boost output are in the Persian Gulf.    ""This is a long-term problem,"" says G. Henry Schuler, a former Middle East  oilman now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  ""It is not something you can meet with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or with  surge capacity in Venezuela. The problem is over-reliance on the Middle East.""

0,FT933-9897 ,"FT933-9897 _AN-DHFBQAFYFT 930806   FT  06 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador opens oil blocks to private sector      By RAYMOND COLITT      QUITO   IN AN effort to attract capital investment and boost production, Ecuador is opening significant sectors of its petroleum industry to private enterprise. Service contracts for oil exploration and production will be open for bidding during September. The government is also soliciting bids for a project to increase the capacity of the country's two oil refineries and the Trans Ecuadorean pipeline. Increasing the capacity of the Refineria de Esmeraldas on the Pacific coast will cost about Dollars 120m, while work on the Refineria Amazonas is expected to cost Dollars 22.6m. Work on the projects is expected to be completed within two years and four years respectively. The pipes leading from the Amazonian rain forest across the Andes to the Pacific ports are to be fitted with higher capacity pumps, enabling them to transport more heavy crude oil, the principal type of crude discovered recently in the region. Ecuador's new foreign investment regulations give foreign and national investors equal opportunities. Foreign oil companies are still subject to a flat 44.4 per cent income tax for repatriated profits compared with 25 per cent for Ecuador companies. A Bill is to be presented to congress shortly in an attempt to equalise this tax structure. Mr Hans Collin, executive president of Petroecuador, said between 40 and 45 foreign and national companies have shown interest in bidding for the projects in this seventh solicitation round. He estimated that the country's oil industry required about Dollars 5bn in capital investment over the next five years to produce the projected 470m barrels a day by 1995, up from 273,000 b/d last year. Several area blocks which are now open for private sector exploitation in the Amazon region as well as on the Pacific coast had previously been reserved for Petroecuador. Mr Henri Bergasse, general manager of the French company Elf Hydrocarbures Equateur, said there were potentially interesting blocks opening up but that there was a risk of encountering heavy crude oil again. Production and transportation costs for heavy crude are considerably higher than for light crude oil and will thus cut in to profits. The solicitation will likely include Block 22, an area that has been subject to considerable controversy due to its importance as an ecological 'hot spot' and one of the last protected areas for indigenous people of the region.

The South African group, which dominates the world's diamond business, is pushing mining technology to the limit, to explore for and recover tens of thousands of very small precious stones scattered across hundreds of square kilometres of seabed. The Debmar Atlantic, a converted oil exploration vessel, has been turned into a floating diamond mine. It sucks up tonnes of material a minute from which the diamonds are sorted. Then, for security reasons, the diamonds are canned on an automated production line, with technology most commonly used for peaches and pineapple chunks. Each can is filled with a mixture containing up to 1,900 diamonds. De Beers Marine, a wholly owned subsidiary of the group, is the only company operating at these depths. The stones in these Namibian waters are 60m years old and may have travelled 1,500km, washed down the Orange River by thunderous downpours in the Transvaal. To locate the diamonds, De Beers meticulously sampled an area as large as Holland. Only the most durable diamonds survived the trip, according to Mr Graham Rees, DBM's general manager. Nearly every one recovered is of gem quality, which is what makes the considerable expense of fishing them out of the sea worthwhile. DBM has spent about Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) to buy and convert its seven vessels. More than Dollars 50m has been spent exploring since 1991. The Debmar Atlantic uses a huge drill to get at the stones. A short helicopter hop away its sister vessel, the Louis G Murray, is using an under-sea robot crawler, as big as a truck, with hydraulic drills operated electronically from the ship. Last year DBM sucked up 302,754 carats of diamonds from the sea bed, 16 per cent more than in 1992. This year the seabed is likely to yield even more carats, according to Mr Rees. It is impossible to say how much the seabed diamonds are worth but DBM's production last year was about a third of Namibia's diamond output in carats and more than that in value.

City analysts agree with BP, however, that lack of pipeline capacity could hinder production increases and profit potential of the 2bn barrel oilfield. Mr Nick Antill, oil analyst at Hoare Govett, the London stockbrokers, estimated that if production was able to reach 500,000 barrels per day, as would be expected from an oilfield of this size, the contribution to BP's pre-tax profits would be Dollars 525m (Pounds 348m) a year. In the company's first detailed briefing this week on the Cusiana and Cupiaga finds in the Andean foothills of eastern Colombia, Mr David Harding, chief executive for Latin America, said the oilfield was 'very significant for BP and we're optimistic'. The size of the oilfield, which BP confirmed was at least 2bn barrels, increases the group's worldwide oil reserves by 5 per cent. Mr Tony Hayward, exploration manager for BP Colombia said the company was very pleased with its appraisal of the Cusiana field although the latest well to be drilled was dry, which showed that the field did not extend as far south as had been hoped. Piedemonte, a new field to the north of the two finds, is being explored in the hope that the oil-bearing rock structure extends further. Mr Richard Campbell, president of BP Colombia, said BP would soon agree a development plan and financing with its partners for phase 1 of the project. Ecopetrol, the state oil company, will take a 50 per cent share in the discovery as part of Colombian law, leaving BP with a 19 per cent stake, French oil group Total with 19 per cent and Triton, the US oil company, with 12 per cent. The partners will invest Dollars 1.1bn in building a pipeline and upgrading an existing line to transport the oil in order to reach production of 150,000 b/d by 1995. BP will pay Dollars 200m of this overall investment. BP officials refused to put a figure on the level of production that will be reached in phase 2 later in the decade, but pointed out that Ecopetrol has estimated 800,000 b/d.

0,FT931-6548 ,"FT931-6548 _AN-DCACUACWFT 930301   FT  01 MAR 93 / A rich new seam: The UK's latest source of energy      By CLIVE COOKSON   Natural gas trapped in coal seams could give Britain a vast new source of usable energy. Geologists say UK reserves of coalbed methane, as the gas is called, may exceed 1,000bn cubic metres - comparable with the total volume in conventional North Sea gas fields. The oil industry is starting to drill wells to extract the methane, which Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, believes 'could represent a very valuable addition to our future energy supplies'. Yet it has hardly been mentioned in the debate currently raging about coal and gas in the UK. 'There seems to be a conspiracy of silence,' says one operator. 'No one wants to talk about a new huge source of gas at a time when many people think we already have more than we need.' Several technical, fiscal and regulatory obstacles will have to be overcome before Britain can exploit coalbed methane on the same scale as the US, where gas is now flowing at a rate of 30m cu m a day. But it could offer a vital supplement to UK gas supplies early in the next century, when the main offshore reserves are likely to have been used up. The Department of Trade and Industry awarded the first eight exploration licences for coalbed methane in 1991; 27 more followed last year. They cover coalfields in England, Wales and Scotland. UK exploration for methane is led by companies with US experience. Evergreen Resources, based in Colorado, is now testing the first well, Sealand-1 just west of Chester in north-west England, and is drilling a second well south of Rhyl on the north Wales coast. 'We believe Sealand is capable of production but we are still evaluating its commercial possibilities,' says Mr Ian Thompson, Evergreen's UK managing director. A dozen other companies are involved in UK coalbed methane exploration. They include Eastern Electricity, Kirkland Resources, Hillfarm Coal, Puffin Oil, Babcock Energy, Powergen and Conoco. All are drilling well away from collieries which could interfere with gas production. Any well is bound to find some methane because all coal seams contain the gas, adsorbed chemically on the surface of coal particles and filling the tiny spaces between them. The question is whether it can be extracted in commercial quantities. The methane is traditionally regarded as a safety hazard in coalmines. It has to be drained from the seams to prevent explosive quantities building up underground. Although small amounts of gas are sometimes used locally, for example to fire colliery boilers, it is normally vented into the atmosphere  -a waste of energy similar to the flaring of natural gas in an oilfield. From the environmental point of view it is better to extract methane for use as a fuel, because it is a powerful 'greenhouse gas'. Each molecule contributes 50 times more to global warming than a molecule of carbon dioxide. Commercial exploitation of coalbed methane started in the US during the 1970s, stimulated by new federal tax credits for unconventional gas production. Six thousand wells have been drilled in three main areas in Colorado/New Mexico, Alabama and Pennsylvania. The technology developed for extracting methane depends first on creating long fractures in the coal seam to enable the gas to flow more easily. The simplest technique, hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water at high pressure. Then the pressure is reduced at the surface - for example, by pumping water out of the well - to stimulate the flow of gas. Mr Eric Allen, an engineer with LAS Energy, a Canadian methane company, says the technology has improved significantly over the past 10 years. 'With recent advances in completion techniques, many new wells produce at levels which are spectacular by any conventional comparison.' Gas does not flow through coal seams as readily as through conventional sandstone reservoirs, so coalbed extraction generally requires more wells for a given area. But methane enthusiasts say the latest wellhead equipment does not make an obtrusive impact on the landscape. 'Drilling costs are higher in the UK than in the US but all other factors appear to compare favourably with the most productive areas in the US,' says Mr John Garratt, managing director of Puffin Oil, an independent energy company with methane interests in both countries. One attraction of the UK market is that gas prices 'are among the highest in the world'. But Mr Henry Boyd, secretary of the UK Onshore Operators Group, says: 'Coalbed methane will not be a bonanza for anyone. The returns will at best be moderate.' Mr Boyd points out that the outlook for coalbed methane in the UK is overshadowed by uncertainties about the fiscal and regulatory regimes. These are spelt out in a memorandum on coalbed methane prepared by Oil Management Services (OMS), a London consultancy which provides the group's administration. The main fiscal uncertainty concerns the point at which petroleum revenue tax would apply to a coalbed methane field. OMS says the reaction of some US companies is: 'Let us know when the UK works out its tax regime; meanwhile we will go to third-world countries which do know what their tax regime is.' A more fundamental legal question is: who owns coalbed methane? British Coal maintains that its property includes not only all coal in the UK but also the gas trapped within it. The onshore operators, on the other hand, insist that the methane belongs to the crown, although most agree that British Coal's permission is required to drill into its seams. 'Licensees have been outraged at the claims being made by British Coal,' says OMS. 'They did not expect to be required to make substantial additional payments to British Coal as a condition for exercising their petroleum licences.' The operators are lobbying the DTI hard to resolve the uncertainties and encourage methane production. The incentive is not only to provide a new indigenous energy source for the next century; it is also to lay the foundations for a UK industry which could export services and equipment to other European countries seeking to exploit their coalbed methane resources, just as the North Sea fields provided the basis for Britain's offshore oil and gas industry.

In a move aimed at bringing the country back into the mainstream of the world energy markets, Pretoria solicited bids for licences to explore virtually all the country's coastal areas, divided into 18 blocks. Mr Pik Botha, the former foreign minister, who is now minister of mines and energy, told a launch seminar attended by oil and gas companies in London that his government 'sees this licensing round as a major step forward in exploring our offshore potential. 'We cannot guarantee that you will discover gas or oil or both,' he said. 'But we are setting in motion an intensive - and extensive - process of exploration never undertaken before'. Bids for licences have to be submitted by April next year, and Mr Botha said he hoped to have the allocation process complete by November 1995. Exploration programmes will have to be for a minimum of three years and a maximum of seven. International oil companies were active in South Africa until the early 1970s when most of them withdrew for political reasons. Since then, there has only been a small amount of exploration, mainly by Soekor, the state oil company. South Africa produces a third of its liquid hydrocarbons artificially from coal, and imports certain amounts of oil, mainly from Iran. Mr Botha said yesterday that the tariff protection given to the local oil and gas industry would continue because of its important contribution in saving foreign exchange. But he said South Africa was keen to widen its trade relations with energy-producing nations, and deals were pending with various OPEC countries which he declined to name. So far, 19 companies - 17 of them from abroad - had asked for information packs about the blocks on offer. Mr Botha said he was 'very encouraged' by the attendance at yesterday's seminar, which included many of the world's major oil companies. Asked whether South Africa was more secure than other new energy markets that are opening up, such as Central Asia, Mr Botha said: 'As secure, if not better' because of the well-developed state of South Africa's mining technology and infrastructure.

Houston is by no means as depressed as parts of New England or southern California, but it shares with the nation a sense of diminished economic expectations. As Republican speakers in the Astrodome tried to drum up enthusiasm for a second Bush term, the business mood outside seemed as flat as stale beer. The legendary Texan 'can do' spirit that Mr Bush doubtless recalls from his own days in oil exploration is greatly subdued. 'Everybody is sitting anxiously waiting for the national economy to pick up,' says Mr Bob Greer, chairman of Tanglewood Bank, a small local bank that has prospered despite the state's financial crash of the mid-1980s. The outlook is for 'continued tough times', says Mr Bill Gilmer, a senior economist at the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. 'The mood is very cautious and concerned.' Local businessmen are disappointed that Mr Bush has done little to help either the energy industry or real estate - two sectors which nearly sank the region's economy during the 1980s. 'Mr Bush must address economic problems in Texas if he is to carry the state in November,' says Mr Ray Perryman, a Texas economic consultant. Like much of the nation, Houston saw fitful signs of recovery earlier this year. Retail sales rose 6 per cent in the first five months against the same period last year. Car and truck sales also rose modestly. But the momentum of recovery seems to be ebbing and few analysts expect any dynamism in coming months. Announcements of big layoffs at local oil companies have shaken consumer confidence. For a while Houston hoped it might escape the national recession that began in July 1990. The region continued to create jobs until July last year, rekindling the myth that the Texas Gulf coast is immune to national trends. That myth arose because many US downturns have been accompanied by higher oil prices that worked, locally, to offset the drag from national recessions. After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, oil prices soared to Dollars 35 a barrel, giving Houston a lift despite the diversification away from energy during the 1980s. But oil prices swiftly retreated, leaving the local economy exposed to adverse national trends and yet another energy sector shake-out. Job growth has turned negative in the past year and the unemployment rate, at 7.9 per cent in June, is a shade above the national rate. The number of US drilling rigs fell below 600 in July, a 52-year low. This compares with about 4,500 during the boom of the early 1980s. The depression in domestic drilling reflects unexpectedly weak natural gas prices, the removal of tax subsidies in 1986 (which makes Texas much less fiscally privileged than Britain's North Sea) and a shift of exploration effort overseas, partly as a result of tougher US environmental controls. Mr Gilmer says the banking industry has stabilised after a 'central bankers' nightmare' in the late 1980s when nine out of 10 big Texan banks failed as a result of sour energy and real estate loans. Bank profitability is steadily improving but, ominously, bankers are still reluctant to lend. Indeed, as of the first quarter, the total of outstanding loans in the south-west was shrinking. Small businesses - the fount of job creation according to Republicans at the convention - are having particular difficulty obtaining loans, partly because of tighter federal regulatory standards. If you have lost money in the past it is almost impossible to get a loan, says Mr Greer. The chairman of the board of the Houston branch of the Fed, who ran a business renting machinery, was among those recently bankrupted when his bank refused to renew a loan. In the longer term there are grounds for cautious optimism. Mr Skip Kasdorf, head of research at the Greater Houston Partnership (an expanded chamber of commerce) points out that 40 per cent of Houston's economic base is now independent of energy, compared with 16 per cent a decade ago. This means Houston should never again experience a recession as severe as that of the mid-1980s when 13 per cent of local jobs disappeared. Unable to compete with financial and distribution centres such as Atlanta and Dallas, Houston plans to carve a niche in engineering and applied technology. The federally funded Johnson Space Centre (which operates the Space Shuttle) is a magnet for high-tech companies. And although Mr Bush is criticised locally for failing to help the oil sector, he came to Houston bearing one gift: the North American free trade agreement. With 40 per cent of goods sold to Mexico produced in Texas (and 70 per cent transported through the state), the pact offers a promise of better times ahead.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

0,FT923-1372 ,"FT923-1372 _AN-CIWCOADBFT 920923   FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Rand Mines to split into four units      By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent   RAND MINES, which in the past year has been transformed from a diversified mining group into a coal mining business with some marginal gold mines and exploration interests, is putting its operations into four independent business units: coal; property; gold and exploration; and platinum. The South African company last year consolidated its successful coal mining interests in Witbank Colliery and renamed it Randcoal. This company and Rand Mines Properties are already listed in Johannesburg. It has now applied to list the other two units, Goldco and Platco, on the Johannesburg stock exchange. Analysts suggested the impetus for change came from Barlow Rand, Rand Mines' controlling shareholder, which lost patience with its subsidiary's unsuccessful diversification away from its core coal business. In the past year Rand Mines has sold its: platinum interests to Impala Platinum; vanadium operations to Vanadium Technologies; chrome business to Samancor; forestry operations to Sappi, and; granite mineral rights to Genmin. Analysts suggest there is not much left in the gold and platinum operations. Rand Mines retained a shareholding in Barplats, its platinum company, but had to take on millions of rands in debt in the process. The company manages four struggling and marginal gold mines - Blyvooruitzicht, Durban Deep, East Rand Proprietary Mines and Harmony - but has reduced its shareholding in each below 10 per cent. Mr Derek Cooper, managing director of Barlow Rand, said the restructuring would enable the different businesses to be evaluated on their merits without the confusion of cross-subsidisation. Secondly, respective managements could now clearly focus on their businesses without the distraction of other, in some case, unrelated activities. 'Thirdly, it allows investors, including Barlows, to take a view on each business and scale their investment accordingly,' he said. Mr Cooper stressed, however, 'this is not the precursor of an unbundling of Barlow Rand'. Barlow Rand has set up a new division, Barlow Rand Mineral Resources, which will contain the restructured mining interests and Pretoria Portland Cement. The restructuring had been well signalled, and Rand Mines' share price ended unchanged at Pounds 6 yesterday.  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "

Ballard headed up the discovery of two fabled sunken ships, the  Titanic in 1985 and, just last month, the World War II German battleship  Bismarck. In both cases, poignant reminders of human frailty persist on the  dark, cold ocean floor, he says, lingering testaments to the dead, dragged far  beyond air and light by plummeting hulks of steel and iron.    Shoes.    Pairs and pairs of shoes resting on the sea floor as if their owners had just  stepped out of them.    ""People say, 'What was it like to go to the Titanic, particularly out in the  debris area, the stern section where everyone died?' "" Ballard recalls of the  ocean liner that sank to a depth of 12,000 feet in the North Atlantic in 1912,  killing 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew. ""There are pairs of shoes all  over there where people actually came to rest on the bottom of the ocean. Their  shoes are still there. Shoes all over the Bismarck, boots all over the place.  Animals won't eat processed leather. They eat the body and the clothes but they  won't eat the leather.""    Oceanographer Ballard, in Los Angeles to announce that he will host a  television series about underwater explorations and other scientific ventures,  is somewhere in the middle of a long explanation about why he pursues the  sunken past with such avidity. Partly, he concedes, it's for the sensations  that only discovery can provide.      The Moment of Discovery    ""I think the thrill of exploration is to see something, to be the first to set  eyes on something that has never been seen before,"" he says. ""The first time I  saw the Titanic, wow! There it was, this monstrous ship just came out of the  gloom and there it was.""    For Ballard, the moment of discovery is intellectually kinetic -- an instant  when he connects palpably with history. ""The best experience that I can give  that's sort of an analogy is like going to Custer's Last Stand,"" he says. ""To  go and stand where Custer stood and imagine, you know, bad day to be in the  cavalry. That's the sense, it's your hallowed grounds. You sense Crazy Horse  there . . . and you just realize the hopelessness of the situation. Well, when  you're out at the Titanic and all of a sudden it happened right here. It's no  longer abstract.""    Unknown territory, scientific and historic, has been Ballard's country for more  than two decades, perhaps even as far back as his childhood in Southern  California, when he was smitten by accounts of African exploration and became  captivated by the Pacific Ocean. Now, four years after the discovery of the  Titanic catapulted him from mere well-known scientist to global fame, the  47-year-old seems to be in the throes of another transformation. This time  around he apparently is eager to shape both the future and the past with the  technology that he developed in more than a decade of underwater exploration.    Furthermore, he plans to use his new tools as the new host of National  Geographic Explorer, a weekly two-hour program produced by National Geographic  and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. It is the kind of popularizing of science  that Ballard has been criticized for in the past by his peers. But Ballard says  he sees his metamorphosis into TV personality as an educational mission that  may help convince children that science is a ""contact sport.""    Discussing the search for the Bismarck, Ballard obviously savors the contact  with history and science.    Because the Bismarck was engaged in a running battle hundreds of miles from  land when it sank, neither the British nor the Germans were able -- or much  interested -- in keeping precise records of their locations. So Ballard's  expedition had to search about 150 square miles of ocean floor, initially with  sonar and then with remote control, computerized robot sensors and cameras  controlled from a surface ship before locating the wreck June 8. (This kind of  exploration isn't cheap, Ballard notes, joking that ""we had 100,000 pounds of  equipment and 10 vans and six robots and a partridge in a pear tree."")    ""You have to understand that the Bismarck battle was waged in a Force 8 sea --  50-knot winds, 15-foot waves -- (with) overcast and no celestial navigation,""  Ballard says.    The search for the Bismarck -- which, like the Titanic, sank on its maiden  voyage -- was further complicated by the nature of the Atlantic Ocean. The  battleship was in ""16,000 feet of water and it was in a mountain range,""  Ballard says, not without enthusiasm. ""It was in an awful place and it was in  the northern latitudes, up at 48 degrees North latitude, which is not a nice  stretch of ocean -- ever, even in the summer.""    Despite the difficulties, Ballard was drawn to the wreck because, like the  Titanic, it is one of the most famous lost chunks of history to litter the  ocean floor. ""I do it because of the challenge to do it,"" he says. ""But I'm  also interested in the fact that this ship is well preserved. . . . There is  probably more history preserved in the deep oceans of the world than in all the  museums of the world.""    Although it has lost its gun turrets and was hit by numerous shells and  torpedoes, the Bismarck still has touches of freshness, Ballard adds, citing  the ""huge painted swastikas"" on the ship's bow and stern.    In its day, the 50,000-ton Bismarck, with heavy armor, eight 15-inch guns  capable of firing one-ton shells 24 miles and high-performance diesel engines,  was one of the most powerful warships afloat. And briefly it proved to be just  that. Slipping out of its home port of Danzig (now Gdynia) on May 18, 1941 to  attack Allied convoys, the Bismarck soon had much of the British Royal Navy  looking for it. At the time England faced a victorious Germany alone and was  dependent on convoys from America for most of its food and war material.  Discovered by two British heavy cruisers    on May 23, the Bismarck was engaged the next day by two other British warships.  From a distance of 25,000 yards, the Bismarck's huge shells hit the Hood,  starting a fire in an ammunition locker. Within minutes the Hood exploded,  killing all but three of the ship's 1,400 crew members. The Prince of Wales was  also damaged.    Of the Bismarck, ""the British were lucky to get it to the bottom,"" Ballard  claims. In the climactic battle, a ""freak hit"" by a torpedo launched from a  vintage World War I biplane knocked out the Bismarck's steering, forcing the  crippled battleship to ""wait for the British to come and get it."" Of course,  the British came and the Bismarck was sunk in the Atlantic about 600 miles west  of France.    Since the discovery of the Bismarck, Ballard says there has been curiosity  about what actually caused the ship to sink -- British firepower or scuttling  by her own crew. But Ballard believes the evidence makes the point moot. The  British warships had orders to sink the Bismarck, not capture it, and the  Germans were under orders not to let the pride of their fleet be taken as a war  prize, he says.    At 10 a.m. on May 27, the captain of the Bismarck ordered his crew to open the  seacocks on his disabled ship, thus flooding the hull, Ballard recounts. About  10:30 a.m., the Bismarck was hit by three torpedoes from the British cruiser  Dorsetshire and sank three minutes later.      Bismarck's Survivors    ""So it was on its way down and the torpedoes helped -- but it was on its way  down,"" Ballard says. ""If they hadn't opened the seacocks, I'm convinced the  British would have sat there and plunked torpedoes into it until it sank. So  it's sort of academic who sank it."" Only about 100 of the Bismarck's crew  survived. Nearly 2,300 perished, including several hundred who were swimming in  the water after their ship disappeared.    It is that moment that seems to galvanize Ballard.    ""When the Bismarck sank, approximately 800 living souls went into the water and  were alive after the ship went under,"" he says, leaning forward in his chair.  ""And the Dorsetshire came in and began picking up survivors and then someone  thought they saw a periscope and they took off and they left 700 people in the  water alive. . . . Can you imagine the awfulness, the hopelessness, the despair  of the sailor who's just had a ship blown out from underneath him? He's  paddling and freezing to death in this water and salvation is right there and  he's grabbing hold of the hull and the ship takes off.""    Ballard has said he will not reveal the exact location of the Bismarck except  to German authorities. As a ship of war, the battleship belongs to Germany, he  says, although there might be some debate about which half of that divided  country would have the more legitimate claim.    As with the Titanic, Ballard says he strongly believes that such relatively  recent wrecks should be left undisturbed, memorials to those who perished. As  for wrecks from the dim reaches of the past, Ballard argues that they should be  explored only by qualified archeologists intent on broadening historical  knowledge. In fact, he still becomes visibly angry that private expeditions to  the Titanic took some artifacts from the wreck.      Developed Deep-Sea Robots    But Ballard seems to be chiefly an enthusiast, not a critic. In particular he  is a proponent of machines, especially robots. Ballard has headed up the  development of a system of deep-sea unmanned robots -- called the Argo-Jason  system. Equipped with cameras and other sensing devices, the robots are now  capable of plumbing the world's deep waters faster and more safely than the  tiny, slow, manned submarines that previously were the cutting edge of ocean  research and exploration, he says.    While an unmanned robot named Jason Jr. was used in a 1986 expedition to the  Titanic, it was only within the last few months that the leap was made ""to  fully robotic exploration,"" Ballard says, meaning that robots can now be  directed from a surface ship rather than from a manned submarine via a control  cable.    It's a relief that he and others won't have to spend five or more hours per day  ""commuting"" to the ocean floor, which averages 12,000 feet in depth, he says.  Even though he has spent a lot of time in cramped research submarines and  probably will spend more, Ballard is miffed by the inefficiency of the  ""romantic little guys,"" referring to the small submarines.    He explains: "". . . you're spending five hours a day freezing to death in this  little sphere. Our average dive time on the Titanic was three hours a day.  Three hours out of 24 and you've got 50 people and you've got one guy looking  out of a window.""      More Interest in Science    Ballard has been talking about the potential of this technology for years. But  recent advances have made him more convinced than ever that the concept of  ""telepresence"" will revolutionize not only undersea exploration but the way  many people ""travel."" More important, he sees the technology as capable of  rekindling interest in science among American schoolchildren.    ""We're now reaching a point in technology, in imaging devices both acoustic and  visual, fiber optic transmission links, digital enhancement, computer  manipulation, robotics etc, etc. to simulate presence,"" he says in a gee-whiz  way. ""In fact many of us in the technology believe it will become a pervasive  way of people living their lives. In other words, ultimately you won't travel  that much. You'll travel in a telepresence way. We can have this conversation  half a world apart and you'll sense my presence, I'll sense yours. . . . The  idea of the Argo-Jason system is to put you in a room and convince you you're  in a submarine looking out a bunch of windows"" that are in fact video monitors  displaying scenes picked up by robot-mounted cameras.    Ballard, whose professional base is the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on  Massachusetts' Cape Cod, is such a believer in the concept of telepresence that  he's already using it to change the way he lives. He recently built a house  near Montana's Glacier National Park in which he is installing a satellite  antenna so that he can bounce his image and voice into space and back to Earth  for professional meetings and conversations with people far, far away. His goal  is ""to create a place where I don't feel professionally inconvenienced by  living in Montana.""    How much time he actually will spend in northern Montana is an open question,  though, given the demands of the Explorer television series.    With the series, including a program on the Bismarck to be broadcast in late  October, Ballard asserts that he can do his bit to instill a respect for the  past and take millions on magical mystery tours of the kingdoms under the sea.    "". . . 70% of the planet's under water. We've seen less than .1% of 1%. I mean  we know more about the mountain ranges on Mars than the mountain ranges of our  own planet,"" he says.      The Vast Unknown    It is this sense of the vast unknown here on Earth that he wants to  communicate.    ""To me the concept of an explorer has been somewhat diminished,"" he says.  ""People now retrace Hannibal's route in a Winnebago or they walk backwards to  the North Pole. It's sort of become a Guinness Book of World Records type of  thing.""    And he says he wants to do his part to protect good old people-friendly dry  land too.    ""It's very important right now to realize that the Earth is in jeopardy and  we're the first generation that can kill it and we're killing it,"" he says,  leaving the battles of World War II far behind. "". . . This baloney about  living in space is baloney. You send everyone else out there and give me  Montana. I have no desire to live underwater. I've seen the place.""

Ballard headed up the discovery of two fabled sunken ships, the  Titanic in 1985 and, just last month, the World War II German battleship  Bismarck. In both cases, poignant reminders of human frailty persist on the  dark, cold ocean floor, he says, lingering testaments to the dead, dragged far  beyond air and light by plummeting hulks of steel and iron.    Shoes.    Pairs and pairs of shoes resting on the sea floor as if their owners had just  stepped out of them.    ""People say, 'What was it like to go to the Titanic, particularly out in the  debris area, the stern section where everyone died?' "" Ballard recalls of the  ocean liner that sank to a depth of 12,000 feet in the North Atlantic in 1912,  killing 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew. ""There are pairs of shoes all  over there where people actually came to rest on the bottom of the ocean. Their  shoes are still there. Shoes all over the Bismarck, boots all over the place.  Animals won't eat processed leather. They eat the body and the clothes but they  won't eat the leather.""    Oceanographer Ballard, in Los Angeles to announce that he will host a  television series about underwater explorations and other scientific ventures,  is somewhere in the middle of a long explanation about why he pursues the  sunken past with such avidity. Partly, he concedes, it's for the sensations  that only discovery can provide.      The Moment of Discovery    ""I think the thrill of exploration is to see something, to be the first to set  eyes on something that has never been seen before,"" he says. ""The first time I  saw the Titanic, wow! There it was, this monstrous ship just came out of the  gloom and there it was.""    For Ballard, the moment of discovery is intellectually kinetic -- an instant  when he connects palpably with history. ""The best experience that I can give  that's sort of an analogy is like going to Custer's Last Stand,"" he says. ""To  go and stand where Custer stood and imagine, you know, bad day to be in the  cavalry. That's the sense, it's your hallowed grounds. You sense Crazy Horse  there . . . and you just realize the hopelessness of the situation. Well, when  you're out at the Titanic and all of a sudden it happened right here. It's no  longer abstract.""    Unknown territory, scientific and historic, has been Ballard's country for more  than two decades, perhaps even as far back as his childhood in Southern  California, when he was smitten by accounts of African exploration and became  captivated by the Pacific Ocean. Now, four years after the discovery of the  Titanic catapulted him from mere well-known scientist to global fame, the  47-year-old seems to be in the throes of another transformation. This time  around he apparently is eager to shape both the future and the past with the  technology that he developed in more than a decade of underwater exploration.    Furthermore, he plans to use his new tools as the new host of National  Geographic Explorer, a weekly two-hour program produced by National Geographic  and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. It is the kind of popularizing of science  that Ballard has been criticized for in the past by his peers. But Ballard says  he sees his metamorphosis into TV personality as an educational mission that  may help convince children that science is a ""contact sport.""    Discussing the search for the Bismarck, Ballard obviously savors the contact  with history and science.    Because the Bismarck was engaged in a running battle hundreds of miles from  land when it sank, neither the British nor the Germans were able -- or much  interested -- in keeping precise records of their locations. So Ballard's  expedition had to search about 150 square miles of ocean floor, initially with  sonar and then with remote control, computerized robot sensors and cameras  controlled from a surface ship before locating the wreck June 8. (This kind of  exploration isn't cheap, Ballard notes, joking that ""we had 100,000 pounds of  equipment and 10 vans and six robots and a partridge in a pear tree."")    ""You have to understand that the Bismarck battle was waged in a Force 8 sea --  50-knot winds, 15-foot waves -- (with) overcast and no celestial navigation,""  Ballard says.    The search for the Bismarck -- which, like the Titanic, sank on its maiden  voyage -- was further complicated by the nature of the Atlantic Ocean. The  battleship was in ""16,000 feet of water and it was in a mountain range,""  Ballard says, not without enthusiasm. ""It was in an awful place and it was in  the northern latitudes, up at 48 degrees North latitude, which is not a nice  stretch of ocean -- ever, even in the summer.""    Despite the difficulties, Ballard was drawn to the wreck because, like the  Titanic, it is one of the most famous lost chunks of history to litter the  ocean floor. ""I do it because of the challenge to do it,"" he says. ""But I'm  also interested in the fact that this ship is well preserved. . . . There is  probably more history preserved in the deep oceans of the world than in all the  museums of the world.""    Although it has lost its gun turrets and was hit by numerous shells and  torpedoes, the Bismarck still has touches of freshness, Ballard adds, citing  the ""huge painted swastikas"" on the ship's bow and stern.    In its day, the 50,000-ton Bismarck, with heavy armor, eight 15-inch guns  capable of firing one-ton shells 24 miles and high-performance diesel engines,  was one of the most powerful warships afloat. And briefly it proved to be just  that. Slipping out of its home port of Danzig (now Gdynia) on May 18, 1941 to  attack Allied convoys, the Bismarck soon had much of the British Royal Navy  looking for it. At the time England faced a victorious Germany alone and was  dependent on convoys from America for most of its food and war material.  Discovered by two British heavy cruisers    on May 23, the Bismarck was engaged the next day by two other British warships.  From a distance of 25,000 yards, the Bismarck's huge shells hit the Hood,  starting a fire in an ammunition locker. Within minutes the Hood exploded,  killing all but three of the ship's 1,400 crew members. The Prince of Wales was  also damaged.    Of the Bismarck, ""the British were lucky to get it to the bottom,"" Ballard  claims. In the climactic battle, a ""freak hit"" by a torpedo launched from a  vintage World War I biplane knocked out the Bismarck's steering, forcing the  crippled battleship to ""wait for the British to come and get it."" Of course,  the British came and the Bismarck was sunk in the Atlantic about 600 miles west  of France.

Bank loans which went to science and technology sectors  increased from merely 15 million yuan in 1984 to 6.3 billion  yuan in 1993, according to a conference sponsored by the China  Commission for the Promotion of Relations Between Science and  Technology and Banking, which was held yesterday in Nanning,  capital of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.    At present, only about 15-20 percent of the scientific and  technological achievements in China can be put into practical  use, due to the lack of necessary funds, according to the  meeting.    However, banking services related to science and technology  undertakings have been developing rapidly over the past few  years since the People's Bank of China initiated a science and  technology loans project and various professional banks started  similar services.    Banks have become another accelerator for the development of  science and technology following state budgets and funds raised  by enterprises on their own.    In 1984, the Bank of Industry and Commerce and the Bank of  Agriculture took the lead in granting loans to the development  of science and technology, which reached 15 million yuan for the  year.    The figure reached 6.3 billion yuan in 1993 when the  country's finances were in disorder for a time. Of the loans,  1.2 billion yuan went to the ""Spark Program"" in favor of local  economic development, 1.7 billion yuan went to the ""Torch Plan""  in support of the development of high- and new-technology  projects, and 900 million yuan went to a program which is aimed  at the promotion of new technologies among traditional  enterprises.    The other funds went to research programs on the application  of military technology to civil use, application of achievements  of research institutes, exploration of resources, environmental  protection and the development of new medicines.    Under the coordination and support of the People's Bank of  China, professional banks have developed the services for nearly  a decade and have achieved great economic gains.    Statistics from Shenyang, a major industrial city in  north-east China's Liaoning Province, show that high and new  technologies contributed to about 31 percent of the output value  yielded by the enterprises in the city last year, largely  because of support from bank loans.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claims Mobil owes about Dollars 300m in taxes on Saudi Arabian oil bought in 1980 and 1981. A further Dollars 1bn of interest is also being claimed. Mr Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil, yesterday disputed the tax bill. It centres on the so-called 'Aramco Advantage' issue of whether Mobil should have charged its consuming country affiliates higher oil prices for Saudi crude that was obtained below world market prices. At the time, Mobil was a minority shareholder of Aramco. Both Exxon and Texaco, two other former Aramco shareholders, are also involved in litigation with the IRS over similar back tax bills. A decision on these cases is expected from a Washington, DC tax court by mid-year. Texaco, the US energy group, yesterday unveiled a decline of almost 20 per cent in underlying 1991 earnings, reflecting lower crude oil and natural gas prices and depressed demand. Stripping out special items in the fourth quarter, Texaco's profits dropped 37.6 per cent to Dollars 295m from Dollars 475m the previous year. Net income in the fourth quarter of 1991 fell 16.5 per cent to Dollars 324m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, from Dollars 388m, or Dollars 1.40, a year earlier. Revenues declined by 25 per cent to Dollars 9.8bn from Dollars 13bn. For the full year, Texaco had underlying profits of Dollars 1.24bn, against Dollars 1.54bn in 1990. Net income in the year eased 11 per cent to Dollars 1.29bn, or Dollars 4.61, against Dollars 1.45bn, or Dollars 5.18, a year earlier. Revenues declined 8 per to Dollars 38.3bn from Dollars 41.8bn in 1990, reflecting sharply lower crude oil and product prices in 1991 which were partly offset by slight gains in crude sales volumes. Texaco's earnings from exploration and production stood 49.1 per cent lower in the fourth quarter at Dollars 175m, compared with Dollars 344m the previous year. The results were in line with expectations, and shares in Texaco added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 63 3/8 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.  The Financial Times   London Page 23  "

0,FT944-1291 ,"FT944-1291 _AN-ELUC8AB6FT 941221   FT  21 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Black Sea's dark future - The conflict between economy and ecology is coming to a head in Odessa      By MATTHEW KAMINSKI   Arkadia beach on the Black Sea may have snow-white sand beloved by tourists, but it is strewn with rusty metal drums; sludge and algae are visible on the water. Now, a row is brewing over sustainable development in a region so damaged by pollution that it is on the brink of ecological death. After committing itself to a Black Sea clean-up, the Ukraine government has angered environmentalists with plans to build an oil terminal near Odessa, up the coast from Arkadia, to handle up to 40m tonnes of oil per year. The new terminal would help Ukraine reduce its dependence on Russia for supplies. As ministers and parliamentarians bicker over the plan, President Leonid Kuchma last month gave his 'categorical' support for the new terminal now awaiting approval from parliament. The incensed green lobby argues that Kiev takes a cavalier approach to the environment and dangerously promotes large industrial projects, just as the Soviet Union did before Ukraine gained independence in 1991. Valery Mikhailov, director of the Ukrainian Scientific Centre of Marine Ecology, says Ukraine has failed to carry out the necessary environmental impact study required by a declaration signed by all six Black Sea rim states. He adds that Ukraine cannot guard against oil spillage. Opponents of the plan argue that oil terminal leaks and tankers bypassing weak regulation by dumping ballast water into the harbour would jeopardise the health of 800,000 people who visit Odessa each summer. The United Nations notes that the 'illegal discharge of ballast and bilge and accidental spills during loading and unloading' account for far more oil pollution than any land source. 'We should have beaches and resorts here,' says Mikhailov. 'They should put it somewhere else. It is a disaster for Odessa.' Environmentalists fear the threat to the ecosystem: it is on the Odessa bank that about 60 per cent of the sea's fish and 70 per cent of the biomass reproduce. Flexing their new democratic muscle, the opponents have formed a committee to try to block the project. Odessa's city council also protested, by declaring the land could not be used, but it was overruled by the national parliament. According to mayor Eduard Gurvits, the former commercial port city founded by Catherine the Great 200 years ago has to put industrial development first. The situation in Ukraine is matched in Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia and Turkey, which this year approved a Black Sea Convention setting up the legal conventions for maritime pollution control but who all, except Turkey, must deal with the economic legacy of the Soviet Union's collapse. 'They all express the same kind of impotence,' says Laurence Mee, who leads the Environmental Management and Protection Programme of the Black Sea in Istanbul. 'You cannot do anything about the environment when you have an economy that cannot afford it.' Among the world's ecological problems, many of which are in the former Soviet sphere, the Black Sea's are formidable. Industrial waste from 17 Black Sea basin countries fed in by several large rivers, especially the Danube and the Dnieper, has killed fishing stock and devastated animal and plant life. Oil, toxic waste and ship ballast water emitted around the rim compounds the Black Sea's lack of a good drainage system to bring in fresh water. Incoming nutrients, as well as poisons, are killing off species, such as oysters and clams, that would help clean the sea. Yuri Kastenko, Ukraine's environment minister, defends Ukraine's record, pointing to a Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.4m) effort to clean up the Dnieper river. That is not enough, critics say. The Sea of Azov, just off the Black Sea, is even more polluted by steel, coal and other industries of the Ukraine's Donbass region. But as environmental enforcement has failed to improve under independence, local concern is now centring on new oil projects, such as at Odessa, but also an off-shore drilling exploration near the Crimean peninsula by JKX Oil and Gas, a UK-based exploration company working mainly in the former Soviet Union. The UN deems offshore drilling a big potential hazard because of the 'risk of blow-outs, fractured undersea pipelines, and other accidental oil spills' that might further contaminate the sea. This anxiety applies to the new project despite a relatively good aerial monitoring system used in Ukraine. Hamish Curren, general manager of JKX Oil and Gas, concedes that 'the consequences of a major accident are dire, but the chances of that happening are possibly overstated'. He adds that bad experiences of developments under the former Soviet Union, typically drilling in the Caspian Sea, are misleading. 'The philosophy of that kind of operation is very different from what western operators apply.' Included in the Black Sea debate have been efforts to substitute tourism for industry, since both the oil projects are so close to traditional resorts in Crimea and Odessa. During the summer Odessa sponsored a conference on developing tourism. Ecotec, a UK consultancy, found the Black Sea coast 'possesses all the key geographic resources including good climate, an excellent coastline and landscape features' to expand tourism. But the poor environment was a problem. Frank Joyce, chairman of Ecotec, has observed that the local administration must do a better job of tourism planning and coastal zone management along Ukraine's 2,500km coast. The other industry hurt by the environment is fishing. Only five species of fish remain of the 26 caught in the 1960s when the Black Sea was one of the world's mmost fecund sources. Total catch dropped from 900,000 tonnes in 1986 to 100,000 tonnes for all six Black Sea rim countries in 1992. Altogether, the World Bank estimates the cost in bad health, poor fishing and reduced tourism at around Dollars 1bn per year. But as Ukraine moves ahead with the oil terminal, the ecologists throw up their hands. Mikhailov reckons the clean-up would take up to 'two or three times Ukraine's national income'.

The Australian Geological Survey Organization (AGSO) has  released its first report on the petroleum potential of an  offshore area in the Philippines.    The AGSO scientists' report includes 10 new maps, based on  current and previously collected seismic data, and shows the  structure of key horizons at a detailed scale, together with  results of the offshore geochemical survey and analyses of  samples taken from onshore oil seeps and exploration wells.    Findings on three other Philippine offshore basins would be  due for release in March.    ""In the Ragay Gulf Basin, the first of the four offshore  basins, major fault systems controlling the distribution of  hydrocarbon traps are now better understood and have been mapped  more accurately than previously. An important limestone  formation containing possible petroleum source and reservoir  rocks is shown to be much more extensive than was thought  previously, and includes reefal deposits which may provide  attractive targets for future oil exploration. Large potential  hydrocarbon traps in various parts of the basin were mapped with  sufficient accuracy to estimate likely reserves,"" AGSO's project  leader, Dr. Chao-Shing Lee said.    From March to May 1992, AGSO and the Philippine Department  of  Energy conducted a cooperative geophysical and geochemical  survey to evaluate the petroleum potential of four offshore  basins in the Philippines.    The $5 million project was funded by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB). A total of  nearly 3,000 line kilometers of seismic and 5,000 line  kilometers of geochemical data was collected using AGSO's  geoscientific research vessel, Rig Seismic.    ""The new-seismic shooting achieved penetration to a greater  depth than previously, allowing improved definition of key  horizons and structural features,"" Lee said.    In geochemical surveying, a towed 'fish' measures the  concentration of hydrocarbons dissolved in sea-water a few  meters above the seabed. Analysis of the hydrocarbons will  determine whether they are ""fossil"" hydrocarbons such as oil,  gas, or condensate escaping from sub-surface rocks, or the  product of recent biological activity in the water column or  bottom oozes.    ""Zones with anomalously high hydrocarbon concentration mark  the sites where hydrocarbons are escaping from the seabed. By  examining these zones in relation to the seismic data, it is  possible to identify areas where hydrocarbons are likely to be  accumulating,"" Lee said.     "

Cuba will soon hold a new round of talks with British  businessmen, sponsored by THE ECONOMIST. One British analyst  says that this, among other things, indicates that London gives  little importance to Washington's claims of an alleged Cuban  collapse.    There is more: Cuban Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal  confirmed during a brief visit to several European and northern  countries the success of foreign contract oil exploration  enterprises that work in Cuba at their own risk. Several  European sources report that two new agreements have been signed  in London.    Qatar, a small, independent, Persian Gulf country that  produces a great deal of oil, not only has established  diplomatic relations with Cuba but also has decided to send  businessmen to Cuba and to work on mutually beneficial projects  with our country.    The 24th OAS General Assembly has just got underway in  Belem,  Brazil. Brazilian President Itamar Franco expressed support for  the OAS reconsidering its 30-year-old resolution separating Cuba  from that inter-American organization. Outgoing OAS President  Joao Baena Soares has also expressed support for this.    An important group of Colombian legislators, most of whom  are  from the Liberal Party, the current governing party, will send a  message to the fourth Ibero-American summit, beginning one week  from today in Cartagena de Indias, demanding the end of the U.S.  blockade against Cuba. In addition, a group of U.S.  businessmen, intellectuals, and politicians, together with  sectors of the Cuban emigre community, will demonstrate against  the blockade in Washington on 9 June.    Other reports state that Russia and Venezuela are  considering  the possibility of resuming the supply of oil to Cuba through a  formula that would save transportation from Russian ports.    Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will arrive in  Cuba on an official visit on 13 June. Mexico has always  maintained relations with our country, relations that remain in  optimum conditions.    These are the facts, not rhetoric, that demonstrate that  Washington's isolation regarding its anti-Cuban policy increases  every day.     "

Interviewed by the Colombian radio network RCN, Lage noted  that the decision when and if to visit Cuba is up to Gaviria.  Lage also stressed the open dialogue between the countries that  began during President Fidel Castro's visit to Cartagena last  August.    He added that the fundamental purpose of his visit, as was  that of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina in December, is to  further dialogue and the exploration of possibilities to  increase economic, commercial, and political ties that began  when diplomatic relations were resumed in October.    Lage has met with the ministers of foreign commerce and  agriculture and livestock and with the planning chief. He also  held a long meeting with President Gaviria, the most important  aspect of which, in Lage's opinion, was the frankness of the  analysis of bilateral relations, the current situation, and  problems between the two countries.    In his conversation with RCN and statements published today  by the daily EL ESPECTADOR, the Cuban leader recapped the  different economic measures his government has adopted,  including opening to foreign investment, and said all measures  necessary to defend socialism will be adopted.    Lage said tourism and the pharmaceutical industry have  prompted great interest on the part of Colombian businessmen,  with whom he held broad discussions today during a meeting  organized by the Industrialists Association and attended by the  major economic groups.    When asked about the illegal departure of Cubans from the  island, Lage replied that his country's policy is to allow  emigration and that anyone who wishes to leave can obtain a  visa. The United States, on the other hand, denies visas but  then accepts and grants immediate residence to anyone who  arrives illegally in that country.    Lage also noted that the majority of people support the  revolutionary system, which could not continue without this  support. In replying to another question, he said that Cuba is  the most drug-free country in the world, since it has no  narcotics, corruption, or organized crime. Lage will conclude  his visit today as the last leg of a tour that included Brazil  and Venezuelan.     "

But the consortium of oil companies planning to build the terminal stressed it would go ahead only if PowerGen, the electricity generator, was allowed to build a Pounds 580m gas-fired power station nearby at Connah's Quay, which would use gas piped from the terminal. The approval process for the power station has been frozen pending the government's pit closure review; blocking further gas-fired power stations is one option to boost markets for coal. The North Wales project would create more than 3,000 jobs during the construction phase and 200 permanent jobs. Investment for a new gas field in Liverpool Bay, the terminal and the power station would total Pounds 1.5bn in the depressed sub-region of Merseyside, west Cheshire and north-east Wales. Amec, the civil engineering and offshore construction group, said yesterday it would reconsider whether to bid for the Cammell Laird yard, which is due to close when it runs out of work this year. Sir Alan Cockshaw, Amec's chairman, said recently the group would be interested in Cammell Laird if development of the gas field allowed it to shift to offshore and related work. The consortium involved in the exploration and development of Liverpool Bay and which wants to build the gas terminal includes Hamilton Oil, Lasmo and Monument. Yesterday, Mr Ed Blair, president of Hamilton Oil called for rapid Department of Trade and Industry approval for the PowerGen project. The terminal was approved by the Welsh Office after a public inquiry. It was opposed by miners at the Point of Ayr pit, one of the 21 pits affected by the closure review, and by environmental groups. The DTI said yesterday there was 'no connection' between decisions on the terminal, which was a planning matter, and the power station, which needs approval under the 1989 Energy Act. However, the companies involved were sceptical about government departments taking decisions in isolation from each other. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who has been a longstanding champion of Cammell Laird, as both environment secretary and defence secretary, now has to make the decision on the Connah's Quay power station, which in turn will have an impact on pit closure policies.

The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) was launched nearly two years ago by President George Bush as the first comprehensive US policy for Latin America since President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress more than 30 years ago. It placed economic partnership at the centre of post-Cold War relations between the US and Latin American democracies. It stressed regional trade liberalisation - opening up the possibility of a free trade zone from Alaska to Antarctica - reform of investment regimes and official debt relief. Former secretary of state Mr Henry Kissinger called it the most creative international policy measure undertaken by the Bush administration. Mr John Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, a study group based in Washington, described the EAI as the first 'post-aid development policy'. Carrying none of the paternalism of previous US policies towards the region, the EAI was applauded by almost every Latin American leader. Although there were some worries that the US was replacing an insistence on anti-communism with an insistence on neo-liberalism as the basis of policy, it succeeded in addressing current concerns of Latin American governments without proposing resource transfers to the region that the US could ill afford. The launch of the initiative came two weeks after the president's announcement of his intention to seek a free trade agreement with Mexico and appeared to signal a new-found US interest in the region beyond the usual concerns about drugs and immigration. The prospect for a partnership was reinforced by the willingness of the Bush administration to work through the Organisation of American States, an organisation it ignored throughout the 1980s. The culmination of this was the June 1991 Santiago declaration which committed member governments to help defend democracy in the region. Since then, however, some of the good feelings have dissipated. The OAS proved helpless to reverse a military coup in Haiti, was stunned by an attempted coup in Venezuela and divided over how to deal with President Alberto Fujimori's dissolution of Peru's Congress in April. Meanwhile, the EAI also showed signs of losing momentum. According to Mr Mark Falcoff, of the American Enterprise Institute, the new policy had 'fallen from the screen'. Mr Viron Vakey of the Carnegie Endowmentsaid he was 'becoming more and more pessimistic about the policy'. Each of the three parts of the initiative suffered delays: Trade: By October 1991, the US had signed bilateral framework agreements - the first step to a free trade accord - with all Latin American countries except the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Surinam and Cuba. But negotiation of free-trade agreements with other countries has had to await the completion of talks with Mexico and Canada over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which have been going more slowly than expected. Chile will be next in line. Investment: Two new programmes were set up with the aim of encouraging reform of economic policies and investment regulation. The first was an Inter-American Development Bank programme to support investment liberalisation and privatisation, from which countries such as Colombia have already benefited. The IADB was also to administer a Dollars 1.5bn Multilateral Investment Fund to which the US, Japan and the EC would each contribute Dollars 100m each a year for five years. Some EC countries, including Britain, declined to contribute, with part of the shortfall being made up by Latin governments. However, in April, the US Congress refused to vote US funding, which meant matching funds from Japan would be unavailable. Foreign debt: Covering Dollars 12bn in bilateral debt owed by Latin countries to the US, it allowed for interest payments to be paid in local currency for an environmental fund and the cancellation of certain loans through debt-for-equity or debt-for-nature swaps. Although only a modest benefit overall - the savings if fully implemented would amount to Dollars 400m a year - this was potentially important for some countries, such as Jamaica, with heavy government-to-government debt. Some debt has already been reduced, but the vast majority was also held up in April by Congress. These delays have contributed to a sense of frustration among Latin governments and a concern that US interest in the region will prove as transitory as it has in the past. Mr David Mulford, US treasury under-secretary for international affairs, disagrees with this view. Admitting congressional delays were a setback, he said this week that the Bush administration remained strongly committed to the initiative, and would press for passage of the relevant legislation in the current fiscal year. Latin America, he pointed out, was the fastest growing foreign market for the US. 'A strong Latin America is good for the US economy,' he said. Those invited to Washington on June 24-25 are finance ministers from a dozen governments which have benefited either from Mr Brady's bank debt reduction initiative or the EAI, or those expected to benefit in the near future, such as El Salvador and Brazil. Mr Enrique Iglesias, president of the IADB, will also attend. Mr Mulford said the meeting would provide the opportunity for consultation before the summit of the Group of Seven in Munich early next month. While this should help to promote the idea of a hemisphere partnership, finance ministers will also be interested to hear how the US proposes to advance the Enterprise initiative. Interested and probably - given the narrow preoccupations of Congress and Mr Bush's own concerns - sceptical.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

By SUE O'CONNELL, ASSOCIATED PRESS      GLACIER NATIONAL PARK, Mont.      Just west of the rushing whitewater river that marks the western boundary of  Glacier National Park stands a 150-foot oil derrick, a thorn in the side of  environmentalists.    This well is no longer a threat to the ecology of the park. After months of  controversy, drilling was abandoned in late October and the well was capped --  not out of concerns for the environment, but because no oil was found.    Now the oil exploration companies have their eyes on other drilling sites in  the region, and that has environmentalists worried.    National conservation groups have observed for years that environmental  problems seldom observe man-made boundaries. They have warned that the national  parks are threatened from development both inside and outside their boundaries.    The Wilderness Society last year listed parks it considered endangered because  of development. Glacier National Park was on that list, with oil drilling cited  as a major worry.    But the state Board of Oil and Gas Conservation in September voted unanimously  to approve the project after 2 1/2 days of hearings in which four wildlife  experts testified that drilling would affect grizzly bears, wolves and bald  eagles.    The board also heard from 9-year-old Shinnah Sullivan of Whitefish, Mont., who  said she represented a group called Children for Wildlife.    ""Animals have rights too,"" she told the board. ""I bet they would say a lot if  they could talk about this. I worry and wonder if there won't be a place for  them in the North Fork when I grow up.""    But supporters of the well pointed out that it was on private property.    ""When a private landowner can't do lawfully what he wants to on his land, then  we have the true endangered species: the free American,"" said Dan Blomquist of  nearby Columbia Falls.    The board issued a new permit with some conditions covering public safety and  pollution. Board chairman Jim Nelson said the hearings were not in vain.    ""It's clear now that this board has a duty to ensure protection of the  environment,"" he said. ""That's one of the criticisms we've had on this: that we  don't know what is going on.""    Now the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have approved the  drilling of two more wells south of Glacier next summer.    ""All the oil development scenarios have an impact,"" said Riley McClelland, a  Park Service eagle expert. ""A dry hole would have the least impact; however,  with each incremental step in oil-field development, the degree of risk to bald  eagles increases.""    ""The industry thinks that no place should be out of bounds or off limits, but  that's not true,"" said Jim Jensen of the Montana Environmental Information  Center. ""There are places on the earth where dangerous development, where any  kind of industrialization doesn't belong. This beautiful corridor is one of  them.""    The MEIC and another environmental group filed the suit challenging the state's  initial decision to issue a drilling permit, contending that  public-participation laws were ignored.    The well, accessible from a gravel road where deer are a common sight, is just  half a mile from the North Fork of the Flathead River, Glacier's western  boundary and a designated wild and scenic river.    It is the first well to actually be drilled in recent years near the park.  Three others have been proposed but have been delayed by environmental  challenges.    Cenex, the exploration company, received speedy approval of its July  application for the test well because it is located on private land and not  subject to the review process required for drilling on public lands.    In the last decade, concerns have been raised about logging, subdivisions,  roads and -- in particular -- an open-pit coal mine proposed eight miles to the  north of the park in British Columbia.    The coal mine proposal was recently dropped, logging has been scaled back and a  compromise plan was accepted for improving the highway leading to the park.    But proposals for oil and gas drilling remain alive, with little middle ground  evident between the companies proposing wells and the groups opposing them.    Industry officials say modern drilling technology leaves little mark on the  land.    ""I have been a little puzzled by the degree of public reaction,"" said Janelle  Fallan, head of the Montana Petroleum Assn. ""You'd think this was a major  open-pit copper mine that was going to be there 50 years and disturbing  hundreds of acres.""    In fact, she said, the rig takes up a relatively small area that will be  reclaimed once the well is capped.    Joe Keating, director of oil and gas operations for Cenex, said the industry  believed for years that the portion of the Overthrust Belt near Glacier would  not produce oil or gas, largely because the pockets were covered by such a deep  layer of stone that they could not be reached by drilling.    But Keating said speculative geophysical work done in the area during the era  of high oil prices reversed that thinking.    Park Supt. Gil Lusk has criticized the state Oil and Gas Conservation  Division's decision to issue a permit for the Cenex well using criteria applied  to other wells around the state, most of which are located on the range land of  eastern Montana.    Both the industry and the oil and gas board need to realize that ""there's a  hell of a lot different about this area"" of snowcapped mountains and glacial  river valleys, he said.    Lusk stressed that he believes some development might be acceptable near the  park, if it is done properly.    ""There can be industry next to the park,"" he said. ""That's not the issue. The  issue is, is industry willing to invest to make it a good neighbor?""    Lusk cited Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. as a business that has done just that by  installing new equipment to reduce emissions that were blamed for killing trees  and slowing tree growth in the area.    But others believe a balance of development cannot -- or should not -- be  struck.    ""This area is not appropriate for many reasons -- for aesthetics, for wildlife,  for destroying the qualities of why people want to come here or live here,""  said John Frederick of the North Fork Preservation Assn., which filed legal  challenges to both Cenex wells proposed in the area.    Frederick lives in Polebridge, a tiny community five miles north of the well  site. The preservation group he heads also has opposed the British Columbia  coal mine, some subdivision efforts and proposals to pave the dirt road that  leads to Polebridge.

0,FT943-1905 ,"FT943-1905 _AN-EIVD2ABEFT 940922   FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Mexican investors to help restart Cuban refinery - Joint venture to operate Soviet-built facility      By PASCAL FLETCHER      HAVANA   A group of Mexican state and private investors has formed a joint venture with Cuba that will spend Dollars 200m to restart and operate a Cuban oil refinery built by the former Soviet Union. Since the 1990 collapse of Cuba's trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc, the Cuban government had been seeking a foreign partner to help run the refinery at the south-central port of Cienfuegos. The installation, completed at the end of the last decade, was practically unused and is currently idle. Announcing the deal in Havana yesterday, Mexico's secretary for foreign relations (foreign minister), Mr Manuel Tello, said the Mexpetrol group would have a 49 per cent stake in the refining joint venture. The group is formed by state institutions Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomex), and Mexico's Instituto de Petroleo, and by four private companies, Ingenieros Civiles Asociados, Bufete Industrial, Protexa and Empresa de Transportaciones Maritimas Mexicanas. Cuba's state oil company, Cubapetroleo, will control 51 per cent of the venture. Mr Tello said the latest investment by Mexican entrepreneurs in Cuba completed the liquidation of Cuba's remaining Dollars 340m debt with Mexico. Cuba, seeking foreign capital to revitalise its recession-hit economy, has already opened up offshore and onshore exploration blocks to oil companies from Canada, France and Britain. Once operating fully again, the Cienfuegos refinery, which has a capacity of 75,000 barrels a day, will refine crude oil from both Mexico and other countries. The resulting oil products could be sold in Cuba, Mexico or to third-party buyers on a commercial basis, Mr Tello said. Besides earning hard currency, the refining deal is also expected to help Cuba alleviate the chronic shortages of oil and oil products since oil supplies from the former Soviet Union fell precipitously. Mr Tello said Mexican investments in Cuba to date totalled more than Dollars 1bn and included joint ventures in tourism, textiles and cement. Another joint production agreement in glass manufacture will be finalised in two or three weeks, Mr Tello said. Mexico, a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), is one of Cuba's biggest trading partners in Latin America and has maintained strong diplomatic and trade links with the island despite continuing US sanctions against the Cuban government.

All of them are located near coastal areas  of the South China Sea. The Chinese company will send a  delegation to Houston, Texas in the United States to seek  exploration partners. The program was first announced in early  May. By 1 June, more than 10 U.S. oil companies had expressed  interest in bidding for the project.

Senior geologist (Gong Zaisheng) is leading  the Houston delegation. He said he is sure that bidding will be  a success because all of the blocks are rich areas.    [Gong speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation]  (Gong Zaisheng) says seven of the areas are rich in natural gas  before this. China originally reserved the areas for  independent exploration, but due to the lack of funds and the  need for more advanced technology it decided to seek help from  overseas counterparts. (Gong Zaisheng) says that the blocks at  the mouth of the Pearl river have large oil deposits. During  the four day bidding, the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation will not only tell potential investors about the  geology of the areas, but also exchange technology with their  overseas counterparts.    The explorations in the South China Sea are important for  south China which is suffering from a shortage of energy.  According to the English newspaper CHINA DAILY, Guangdong  Province will need to triple its current energy capacity in  order to cope with the rapidly expanding economic growth in the  area. Hainan, Fujian, and Guangxi are also expected to  experience increased demands. At present, the southern  provinces transport more than 1 million tonnes of coal from  north China every year to meet the demand. Geologist (Gong  Zaisheng) says his company is planning to build a long-distance  gas pipeline which will serve major coastal cities. The pipeline  will carry natural gas produced offshore in the South China Sea.  [end recording]     "
0,FT944-4352 ,"FT944-4352 _AN-ELHD0AGPFT 941208   FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (5): Winners yet to appear - Foreign exploration indicates gas could have greater potential than oil      By PAUL GAUNTLETT   A string of disappointing results from oil blocks in Vietnam's southern waters has punctured the optimism of the foreign energy companies which have been prospecting since 1992. Indications are that gas, not oil, could be the country's fuel of the future. None of the eight foreign operators that have drilled in the Nam Con Son basin (an area 350km south of the coastal town of Vung Tau) has struck commercially viable amounts of oil. Many, including big names such as Shell, Total and British Petroleum (BP), are still committed to drilling exploration wells as part of contractual arrangements with state oil agency PetroVietnam, but a major discovery of natural gas by BP in September has shown that the region is not as rich in oil as many firms expected. BP said when it announced the find that recoverable reserves could be about 2,000bn cubic feet, enough to generate electricity for the southern industrial centre of Ho Chi Minh City for 25 years at current levels of consumption. 'The fact that the Nam Con Son Basin is more gas prone than was first thought has become clearer and it could yield more gas discoveries,' said Michael Yeldham, BP chief executive in Vietnam. Vietnam plans to pump 7.1m tonnes of crude this year, up from 6.3m in 1993. Most of it comes from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field, operated by the Russo-Vietnamese joint venture VietSovPetro and which was the country's only producing field until Australian operator BHP started producing small amounts at the Dai Hung (Big Bear) field in October. BHP hopes to have tapped 250,000 to 350,000 tonnes by year's end. Nearly all the crude is exported to Japan and is Vietnam's largest source of foreign currency revenue. However, these amounts are not enough to ensure Vietnam achieves targeted double digit economic growth by 2000. Hanoi is therefore keen to develop gas as fast as possible to increase foreign currency earnings and has charged the State Planning Committee with mapping out a master plan for the gas industry. Under a 'fast track' programme, priority is being given to building the infrastructure needed to bring commercially viable amounts of gas onshore. The first phase was the installation of Vietnam's first gas pipeline early this year by Korea's Hyundai Heavy Engineering. The 107km undersea pipeline runs from the Bach Ho oilfield and is designed to tap gas being flared off at a rate of 3m cubic feet a day. Test flows, due to start in November, were delayed because of an accident which damaged the pipe. The second phase involves the construction of an offshore compression platform and a liquefied petroleum gas plant on the coast near Vung Tau. British Gas and Mitsui last month finished work on a feasibility study for the Dollars 450m project. Industry sources say the speed at which Vietnam can develop its energy sector will depend on financing. Although the technical aspects of the British Gas study are clear, industry sources say there are doubts about how the second phase of the project, and any others, will attract project financing without government support. Vietnam's sovereign debt risk is still high and there is no precedent for large-scale financing. Projects would have to demonstrate sufficient foreign exchange revenues to justify any financing. 'The gas that comes ashore will be two and a half times as expensive as (that in) Indonesia or the Middle East because of the infrastructure needed to bring it ashore,' said Marie Belsey, British Gas Vietnam country manager. BP told the communist party daily Nhan Dan that it and its partners could spend as much as Dollars 1bn building production facilities offshore and an undersea pipeline to make use of the gas in Block Six, where it found gas. Up to a further Dollars 1bn could be needed to develop a market for the gas onshore, it said. Although Vietnam needs the gas domestically for power generation and fertiliser production, the government is also keen to export as much as possible, possibly to Thailand, which is known to be looking at further import sources. However, Hanoi will probably have to wait until next year to see how much gas is offshore. US firm Mobil, returning to Vietnam after a 19-year absence, is testing for gas at the Thanh Long (Blue Dragon) field but with no luck so far. Foreign firms say government planning will be crucial to successful exploitation of the country's gas. Late last month Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister, decided PetroVietnam should carry out a feasibility study looking into building Vietnam's first oil refinery in the poor province of Quang Ngai in the country's central region. The province, 525km north-east of Ho Chi Minh City, is hundreds of miles away from the offshore oilfields. Foreign oil firms were puzzled. A consortium of France's Total and Taiwanese partners had been working on a feasibility study, commissioned by state oil agency PetroVietnam, for a Dollars 1bn plant near Khanh Hoa, close to the oil industry hub of Vung Tau. The issue underlines the difficulty foreign firms prospecting for oil and gas sometimes have in gauging whether commercial priorities take precedence over political considerations as Hanoi decides how best to harness the country's energy resources. The country is also spending huge sums importing refined crude to fuel industrial growth and desperately needs its own refining capacity. PetroVietnam officials hope that as much as a third of the 6m tonnes of crude to be refined at the planned Quang Ngai plant will be shipped from Indonesia or the Middle East. But Danang, the nearest port, is too small to accommodate the kind of traffic anticipated and is not linked to major shipping lanes. Transporting the country's own crude northwards to the refinery from offshore fields off the southern coast of Vung Tau will add further costs. Meanwhile, bids have just closed on a promising oil block in the Mekong basin, closer to Vietnam's coast than the Nam Con Son basin and next to blocks with modestly encouraging finds by Japanese and Malaysian firms in June.

0,FT921-11090 ,"FT921-11090 _AN-CBCA0ABFFT 920203   FT  03 FEB 92 / Arts: An artist inspired - Architecture      By COLIN AMERY   Ben Johnson is one of the few practising artists in the world who is inspired by architecture. This is curious because there was a time when artists were architects and architects were artists. They spoke the same language and understood one another. In his new exhibition, at Fischer Fine Art in London until March 5, the precise observations of this excellent artist are revealed in two guises. The smaller half of the show is a group of abstract analyses of geometric problems; the larger element consists of powerful architectural studies of recent and much older buildings. The artist has called his exhibition Paintings and Diverse Objects, with perhaps the most spectacular object being the remarkable table, which is both a painting and a sculpture. The other intriguing three-dimensional object is the maquette for the giant, colourful mobile for the London headquarters of ITN. The most rewarding paintings are those recently painted in Italy. Johnson is best known for his celebration of the geometry of high-tech buildings and these explorations of classicism represent a newer, calmer phase of work. He has been working in the Palladian villas in and around the Veneto, and there is a new, textural quality in paintings like the one in Fischer's window of the Teatro Olimpico at Vicenza - a stunning picture. His interior views are always formal and cool, but in these Italian subjects an interest in surface decoration is now apparent. Coolness returns to the palette in the long vistas of the corridors at the Cini Foundation in Venice. They suggest both solid architecture and watery infinity. In many of the paintings, light draws the eye in to more eternal realms than those actually painted. Johnson has a sense of universal geometry. It is something he could one day apply to an exploration of the nude figure which, if added to his repertoire, would virtually complete his artistic achievement. As it is, his paintings are resolved, calm and beautiful - and in the present climate, may it be said, bargains for the serious collector of contemporary representational works of art.

And if you think  through the current environmental crisis, you'll see solutions more than  problems -- and signs of new industries emerging.    First, though, it's important to understand that environmental problems are in  many ways an economic signal, a symptom like fever in the body, pointing to  areas where true costs are not being recognized. The environmental movement is  not an enemy of the economic system -- though it certainly attracts its share  of cultists -- but a rigorous accountant of it.    By the same token, industry and technology -- and not a Luddite retreat -- will  solve environmental problems. In fact, it's a fair bet that biotechnology will  be a big part of the environmental solution, just as microchips helped  alleviate the energy crisis of the 1970s.    But that gets ahead of the story. Today is Earth Day, and concern for the  environment is being celebrated everywhere, as it was marked last week by the  White House conference on global warming -- the theory that carbon dioxide  emissions from burning coal and oil have set up a climatic effect that will  increase the earth's temperature and turn farmland into desert, even while  melting ice caps and flooding coastlines.    President Bush called for further research on global warming, while European  delegates wanted immediate action on the problem. ""Bush is right, we don't know  enough about long-term climatic change,"" says Allan Kneese, senior fellow of  Resources for the Future, a Washington research group that has been studying  environmental change for three decades.    Sure, he's right. For curbing carbon dioxide, the United States already has  clean-air laws that are far more rigorous than any in Europe. But the global  climate is a new kind of question on which data is either contradictory or  incomplete. The problem isn't new -- carbon dioxide has been accumulating in  the atmosphere for centuries -- but awareness of it is. And at such times we  have better questions than answers.    Yet the record is reassuring. The first Earth Day, in 1970, was concerned with  polluted rivers and air and came eight years after the late marine biologist  Rachel Carson published ""Silent Spring."" She said pesticides, such as DDT, and  effluent from factories were killing fish and plant life. And though industry  and farm groups initially attacked her, Carson was right. Agriculture had  failed to recognize side effects in DDT, and industry had failed to account  properly for waste disposal. Pollution, in fact, can treble the cost of using  water -- even for industrial purposes.    Now those problems have been solved, not perfectly perhaps, but Lake Erie is  cleaner and edible fish live again in New York's Hudson River. The sulfur and  particulates that were the chief air pollution concerns in 1970 have been  sharply reduced.    So we are addressing other problems, longer in time and broader in geography.  We now see that a power plant in Ohio can send acid rain to Maine; that garbage  leaks poison into soil and water, and toxic waste is lasting.    The problems -- holes in the stratospheric ozone layer above Antarctica --  often seem beyond our power to affect. But environmental history shows that the  human mind comes up with solutions almost as problems appear.    It was that way with energy. In the 1970s, the conventional wisdom said that  energy would be scarce forevermore and economic growth would stall because it  was believed that a 1% increase in energy use was needed to produce a 1% rise  in economic growth.    Then all that changed. Today it takes less than one-half of 1% growth in energy  to produce a 1% rise in the economy, and the trend is down.    What happened? A rise in the price of oil made everyone aware of wasteful usage  -- of less-than-fuel-efficient cars and homes and industrial practices. The  solution was conservation and the downsizing of machinery with the aid of  memory chips and processors.    The United States uses no more crude petroleum today than it did in 1970, and  uses less iron ore and steel, lead and copper. Downsizing caused economic  dislocation -- people lost jobs, some communities were devastated -- but not  economic ruin. Instead, a new economy emerged, based on the use of less raw  material and more plastics (a derivative of petroleum).    The use of plastic in the United States has gone way up as new wonder materials  have reduced the weight in cars and airplanes, drainage pipes and backpacks.    But we are becoming aware of another cost: Plastics do not break down in  nature. ""Plastic simply accumulates in landfills, leading to toxicity,"" says  Barry Commoner, a long-time environmentalist and professor at New York's Queens  College.    The problem is economic as much as environmental. Plastics are relatively  cheap, but that may be because disposal costs aren't being recognized. So now  plastics prices should go up to account for the cost of making them degradable,  and other materials -- glass, recyclable paper -- will regain some markets.    The trend in environmental policy is to stress economic incentives and  preventing pollution as opposed to only reducing it, says James K. Hammitt of  Rand Corp., which advises the government on environmental matters. That means  consuming different fuels rather than putting scrubbers on power plants, and  using recycled or entirely new materials rather than simply cutting back on the  use of polluting materials.    And that policy opens the way for advances in biotech -- the use of living  organisms as commercial products -- in both industry and agriculture. There are  more biogenetic products than ever up for Department of Agriculture approval,  says Alan Goldhammer of the Industrial Biotechnology Assn. in Washington.    They are overdue because the economic and environmental laws of diminishing  returns from chemical fertilizers and additives set in a long time ago. Yields  in U.S. cornfields, for example, grew 5% a year for more than two decades after  World War II -- from 45 bushels per acre to 145. But then they stopped growing,  and since the mid-'70s the soil has demanded more fertilizer and water to  maintain the same yields.    But now environmental accountants are questioning the low prices farmers are  charged for federal water, as well as hazards from chemical fertilizers. So  enter biological products, which can encourage growth by duplicating the crop's  own hormones while conserving water by giving a crop the water-storing  characteristics of a semi-arid plant such as the palm.    Is that tampering with nature? No, it's in the great tradition of U.S.  agronomist Norman Borlaug, who in the 1940s -- working in Mexico as the world  raged in war -- cross-bred shoots of rice and wheat to make them resistant to  disease and weather damage. His work, for which he was given the Nobel Peace  Prize -- brought about the green revolution in Asia, saving millions from  famine and bringing Asia the economic growth we see today.    Will environmental concerns stop economic growth? On the contrary, says Oliver  Nicklin, head of Chicago's First Analysis Corp., an investment firm  specializing in environmental companies, ""you can't have economic growth  without dealing with the environment.""

0,FT934-2522 ,"FT934-2522 _AN-DLND1ABJFT 931214   FT  14 DEC 93 / Land bill leaves Australians unclear where they stand: An Aborigine rights law that pleases few      By NIKKI TAIT   Noel Pearson, a 28-year-old lawyer, tells a group of Australian senators why he, and fellow Aborigines, negotiated a milestone land rights deal with the government: 'It was a salvage exercise - a desperate salvage exercise.' Michael Mansell, speaking for the more radical Aboriginal Alliance Committee, tells the senators that the proposed legislation which has come out of those negotiations and could be passed into law this week, would do little to help his people. Worse, it could impede their rights in some areas. Both men are presenting their views in a Canberra committee room which, with its air-conditioning and wood-panelling, is far from the scorched red earth at the centre of this fight. There, everyone agrees, Aborigine communities with rudimentary education and limited access to information, have little hope of grasping the complex legal tussle that is going on. 'I can't say that half of Aborigines have any understanding of this bill,' says Mr Mansell. The Australian government's native title bill is also perplexing the business community. Lawyers for the nation's mining and resource-based companies have spent weeks scouring the wording and wondering whether money poured into project development would now be secure from lengthy legal battles. 'Let's put it like this. The lawyers haven't found any problems - yet,' says one mining executive, when asked about the likely go-ahead for a stalled multi-million-dollar deal. Summing up the general concern, Mr John Prescott, head of BHP, Australia's largest industrial company, has likened the legislation to 'reading porridge'. For all the confusion, its significance is difficult to understate. In simple economic terms, land-related industries are crucial to the nation's prosperity. Mining and agriculture, for example, account for about 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product and provide more than 60 per cent of merchandise exports. The native title bill represents an attempt by today's Australia to come to terms with a less than glorious aspect of its past. When European settlers first arrived in Botany Bay in the late 18th century, they worked on the premise that land was uninhabited. This was despite an evident indigenous population who were simply 'dispossessed'. This was compounded by decades of shoddy treatment meted out to the Aboriginal community. A law prohibiting racial discrimination came into force only in 1975. Unemployment is high among indigenous people and social conditions are poor. Tensions lurk close to the surface. The death recently of Daniel Yock, a young Aborigine dancer who had been arrested in a Brisbane street brawl, prompted riotous demonstrations, allegations of police brutality, and a public inquiry. The immediate catalyst for some form of native title legislation has been legal rather than moral, however. Last year, the Australian high court decreed that native title could exist where Aborigines had maintained a close and continuing relationship with the land, although it added that land titles acquired under accepted law since European settlement should not be disturbed. The bill is an attempt to marry these two pronouncements. In essence it provides for a system of 'validating' existing land titles. Where this happened, and except in the case of mining leases, native title claims would be extinguished. In the case of mining leases, native title would be allowed to stand alongside an existing lease, then take over when that lease expired. However, where a genuine native title claim was extinguished, compensation would be paid by state or federal government. A system of tribunals would be set up to handle claims and adjudicate on compensation matters. Native title holders or claimants would have negotiating rights over the land in question but no veto right. The compromise nature of the legislation means that its likely practical implications please no one. On the Aborigine side, it is estimated that no more than 10 per cent of the indigenous population would have any chance of successfully asserting native title claims. In most cases, victorious claims would be levelled against vacant Crown land, the largest amounts of which lie in western Australia. This makes all important the federal government's promise of a land fund to help the majority of Aborigines who did not gain from the bill. 'The only way my people in Cape York are going to benefit is via the land fund,' says Mr Pearson, for example. But the dollar amount has yet to be spelt out. Moreover, as more radical voices such as Mr Mansell's point out, even where Aborigines do establish native title they would not get back everything which the land holds. Mineral rights, for instance, would remain with the Crown. While the mining and pastoral industries know that government would pick up compensation costs, this would not prevent long hearings to establish native title rights. In theory, the private sector should be no more than a bystander in this process; in practice, it would probably incur legal and other costs. Meanwhile, the ability of native title claimants or holders to negotiate over developments may lead to unwanted delays. Such uncertainties - and there are others - could affect the availability and cost of project finance, it is argued. The nation's biggest mining companies warned this month that the need to establish the native title position before beginning exploration would divert the industry's investment abroad. 'You'll see the exploration dollar vote with its feet,' says one executive. And for the general public, there is the big unanswered question of how much the compensation claims would cost, but the government refuses to be drawn. One Treasury official has hinted that higher taxes may be down the road. Opposition leaders have warned that the sums, including the land fund, could be considerable; the government says it is impossible to assess, although it expects that the number of successful native title claims would be limited. Judging by opinion polls, this leaves the public as wary as everyone else about the legislation's merits.   Countries:-  AUZ  Australia.   Industries:-  P6541 Title Abstract Offices.

Ministers expressed 'grave concern' about the threat to regional security. 'We cannot any more postpone the urgent necessity to seriously seek a solution,' President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines said in a speech to open the meeting of Asean foreign ministers, 'lest the unsettled situation lead to perilous developments'. Mr Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian minister, said his country viewed the matter with 'grave concern'. The ministers of Asean - grouping Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - raised the Spratlys issue at a meeting yesterday with Qian Qichen, their Chinese counterpart. They also spoke of their worries about the progress of the United Nations peace plan in Cambodia, where the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge faction is refusing to disarm its guerrillas. Most Asean ministers emphasised security concerns and gave second place to economic co-operation. The Spratlys, a scattered group of islets, atolls and coral reefs, have become a particularly sensitive issue since May, when China granted an oil exploration concession to Crestone Energy of the US in an area claimed by Vietnam. Six countries have laid claim to all or some of the Spratlys (China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines), but China passed a law in February reaffirming sovereignty over the islands of the South China Sea and reserving the right to use military force. In his meeting with Asean yesterday, Qian reiterated China's view that territorial differences should be 'shelved' in favour of joint development of the area, but he apparently did not explain how this fitted in with China's recent actions. According to Filipino officials, he suggested a security dialogue with Asean to enhance trust and rejected accusations that China was seeking to fill a power vacuum left by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the closure of US bases in the Philippines. 'It is not necessary for any country to fill up this so-called vacuum,' Qian said on Monday. He also told the Asean ministers that the dispute was being exaggerated, and that it would be better not to discuss it in public to avoid increasing tension. In 1988, China sank three Vietnamese naval vessels and killed 72 Vietnamese in a battle over the Spratlys.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 51m to Pounds 16m in the year to December 31. The profits shortfall included a Pounds 16m loss on a disposal and Pounds 8.4m of restructuring costs. At the interim stage Ocean reported a 10 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 20.8m. Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the company remained cautious about the outlook for its markets. Turnover increased 6.2 per cent to Pounds 1.43bn. But higher costs, and the restructuring charge saw operating profits fall 30 per cent to Pounds 38.1m. The loss on disposal referred to the sale of Ocean's non-UK bulk liquid storage business. Freight and distribution services, which includes MSAS and McGregor Cory, reported a slight fall in operating profits from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 16m, mainly because of depreciation and other costs associated with MSAS's new computer systems. Operating profits from marine services fell more than Pounds 6m to Pounds 24.1m amid falling demand for offshore oil services. Mr Barber said a downturn in the North Sea prompted the company to shift its exploration vessels, mainly to the Far East. Environmental services announced a 21 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 4m. Earnings on a FRS 3 basis were 2p (24.6p). Ignoring the losses on disposals and restructuring costs, earnings were 17.5p. The company is proposing a maintained final dividend of 9.62p to make an unchanged total of 14.33p. The shares closed up 2p at 283p. COMMENT These results were well flagged so the frightening profits fall - in headline terms - caused few ripples in the City. Analysts were slightly disappointed the company was less upbeat about freight forwarding, where computing costs are likely to continue to drag. However, after a gloomy picture at the interim stage, oil services performed creditably thanks to the timely move east. This year a number of factors will work in Ocean's favour, even if the company's caution about its markets proves correct. The company should recoup most of last year's restructuring costs through greater efficiencies while, if the dollar remains stable against sterling, there should be a currency benefit of Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m. Forecast profits of Pounds 44m put the shares on just under 14 times. Until there are more signs of life from its markets, that rating looks about right.   Companies:-  Ocean Group.

Freud saw his own passion for collecting antiquities as extravagant and reckless - a redeeming trait on which he could draw when defending himself against charges of 'petit-bourgeois correctness'. The editors of The Cultures of Collecting are at pains to emphasise that they are concerned with an activity more wild and maverick than mere 'orthodox connoisseurship'. Noah, 'the first collector', is invoked as a figure obsessed with possessing a complete category in each and every of its variations. In Roger Cardinal's essay, Kurt Schwitters is portrayed as a collector untrammelled by established boundaries: Cardinal repeatedly notes the disgusting, filthy and possibly smelly oddments that he assembled for his collages. Many of the illustrations support this sense of a disregard of limits. Anthony Alan Shelton, analysing Renaissance collecting, includes among his striking visual images an engraving of a museum in Naples, in which shells, fish and other such exhibits cover the entire ceiling and spare wall-space. Nicholas Thomas provides an intriguing account of collisions between raffishness and respectability in late 18th-century perceptions of exotic objects. The concept of curiosity, so central to the pleasure offered by such objects, could only with difficulty be rescued from imputations of sexual licence. Elsner and Cardinal, however, choose as their introductory essay a translation of part of Jean Baudrillard's Le Systeme des objets, which hardly encourages a view of collecting as engagingly flamboyant. Assembling objects is, Baudrillard argues, a discreet variety of sexual perversion, a form of fetishism, a retreat from personal relationships. The main problem with this as a starting-point for further discussion is that it deprives the impulse to collect of the singularity that interests the reader in the first place. Like any other human desire, this impulse turns out to be all too easily and directly linked to sexuality and the fear of death. Fortunately, other essays, in examining specific assemblages of objects, establish such connections in more oblique and beguiling ways, such as Susan Stewart's exploration of the complex, poignant process through which a late 18th-century American artist used both his paintings and his museum of natural objects to come to terms with the deaths of four of his infant children.

0,FT944-11191 ,"FT944-11191 _AN-EKHDPAAIFT 941108   FT  08 NOV 94 / UK's first Atlantic oilfield wins development go-ahead      By ROBERT CORZINE   Development of Britain's first offshore oilfield in the deep Atlantic waters west of the Shetland Islands was given the go-ahead by the government yesterday. British Petroleum and Shell plan to spend Pounds 550m on developing Foinaven, the first field in a region that preliminary drilling results suggest may contain 4bn barrels of oil. When fully developed, the region could produce up to a third of Britain's present North Sea output of 2.5m barrels a day. However, the field is in 450 metres of water and in a region, known as the Atlantic Frontier, where weather can be harsher than in the North Sea and sub-surface currents more complex. As a result, production will not be from fixed platforms of the type used in the North Sea. Foinaven's oil will be fed into a large ship, a production and storage unit, moored over the sea-bed wells. The ship will feed a shuttle service of tankers. Production at Foinaven is scheduled to start by the end of next year. British contractors have so far won 72 per cent of the work for developing the field, amounting to some Pounds 400m of the Pounds 550m likely to be spent. Other western European-based companies have won another 20 per cent. Announcing the go-ahead yesterday, Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister, said the development would require 'novel approaches' from the oil industry if the region was to reach its full potential. Mr Eggar also signalled that the government would like a co-operative approach to any pipeline project in the area in order to control costs. The minister said oil industry interest in the region had been unprecedented. Eighteen companies had bid for one of the blocks, the largest number of bidders for any one area. Although exploration is still at an early stage, a report by oil companies identified 11 possible sites for development between 1995 and 2010 at a cost of Pounds 9.5bn. The report concludes that if the eventual reserves proved large enough, a joint pipeline might result in considerable savings on operating expenses. It might also lead to higher recovery rates, according to Mr Norman Smith, managing tor of Smith Rea Energy Associates, one of the report's authors. BP said that the bulk of spending in the North Sea went into fixed platforms. But Foinaven's floating production facility would account for just 35 per cent of spending. New methods of drilling and the complex subsea wells would account for 35 per cent and 30 per cent respectively.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.     Shell Transport and Trading.

The city, rich in geothermal energy sources, has reserves of  underground hot water estimated at 7.876 billion cubic metres,  said an official from the municipal government at a recent  conference.    Baodi County, north of Tianjin, has the city's biggest  reserves of subterranean hot water, which cover a total area of  8,700 square kilometres. Ten of these heat fields, encompassing  3,074 square kilometres, are especially rich.    Tianjin's underground hot water, with temperatures between  25  and 150ëC, is widely used in timber manufacturing, home  heating, greenhouses, heated swimming pools, and scientific  research.    The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has invested  tens of millions of yuan in exploring the city's underground  heat resources. The United Nations Development Programme has  also invested $5 million.    Tianjin has tapped more than 250 underground hot water  reservoirs. The deepest required drilling to a depth of 3,654  metres, and the hottest is 98ëC.    The city uses about 38 million cubic metres of underground  hot water annually, with thermal energy equal to that produced  by 2.5 million tons of coal.    Tianjin is one of the country's biggest underground heat  energy centres. More than 140 overseas experts have visited the  city to consult on the exploration of underground heat resources.    Businesses from the United States, Iceland, France, Italy,  New Zealand and Japan have expressed interest in investing in  the development of the subterranean heat resources.    A contract was signed over the weekend between three Chinese  companies and a Hong Kong firm to set up a joint venture to  build a power station in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province.    The total investment for the project will be 1.84 billion  yuan ($212 million).    The four companies--the State Energy Investment Corporation,  Jiangsu Investment Corporation, Xuzhou Investment Corporation,  and the Hong Kong-based China Resources (Group) Company  Limited--hold 30, 20, 15 and 35 percent of the stake,  respectively.    The signing converts the Pengcheng Power Plant from a  solely-domestic joint venture into a China-Hong Kong venture.  The limited-liability contract has a term of 20 years.    The designed capacity of the power plant is 1.2 million  kilowatts. The first phase of the East China project includes  two units of coal-fired 300,000-kilowatt generators.    The first unit is expected to be put into operation in  September 1996.     "
0,FT943-2512 ,"FT943-2512 _AN-EISF8AC3FT 940919   FT  19 SEP 94 / The oil has not run out: The sector's comeback      By ROBERT CORZINE and GILLIAN TETT   Out of sight and out of mind could be the motto of the UK offshore oil and gas industry as it prepares this week to observe the 30th anniversary of the first North Sea exploration licences. With most production platforms standing far offshore and support facilities concentrated in remote coastal towns, the industry's public profile has slipped below the horizon in recent years. Not so North Sea oil and gas production. In spite of a widespread perception that the UK oil industry is long past its heyday, the sector has this year staged a dramatic comeback with a surge in production that has boosted the trade figures and flattered overall UK economic data. Average oil output for the year so far is up by 29 per cent against 1993, according to figures from the Royal Bank of Scotland, with output recently running at about 2.4m barrels a day. The high rate of growth, which follows years of decline, has taken many City economists by surprise. 'Most people had been aware that oil and gas would expand over the next couple of years,' says Mr Leo Doyle, UK economist at London brokers Kleinwort Benson. 'But they had not expected it this quickly.' The main reason is that a sizeable number of new fields have been brought onstream over the past year and are building up to peak production. Among the larger ones are Scott, operated by Amerada Hess of the US, Enterprise Oil's Nelson field and Alba, operated by Chevron. Most were approved three or four years ago, when oil prices were considerably higher than the present level of about Dollars 16 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend. But the new fields have also benefitted from the extensive cost-cutting undertaken by the industry in recent years, as well as from efficiency gains brought about by new technology. Technology is also helping companies to extend the life of older fields and to exploit small accumulations which in the past were seen as uneconomic, another factor behind this year's surge in output. A case in point is the Gryphon field, 200 miles northeast of Aberdeen and is operated by Kerr-McGee, the US oil company. The 100m barrel field is considered small by earlier North Sea standards, but is typical of the type of fields that will need to be developed if UK production is to stabilise at its new, higher levels. To save money, the company forsook the conventional fixed oil platform, which would have cost Pounds 400m, and bought instead a tanker-like 'floating production and storage unit' for Pounds 260m, according to Mr Roy Phillips, Kerr-McGee's general manager in the UK. The cost advantages of ship-shaped production vessels are such that they are being considered for a number of new projects, including the first phase of development at British Petroleum's Foinaven field west of Shetlands, the most exciting new exploration area in UK waters. The industry's new ability to drill horizontal wells within the seabed has also 'transformed the economics of the field,' says Mr Phillips. Development costs vary according to the field, but many companies have been able to cut them by half with the help of the new seismic techniques and drilling methods. BP for example, with one of the most extensive North Sea operations, has seen its worldwide development costs fall from around Dollars 10 a barrel five years ago to between Dollars 4 and Dollars 5 a barrel. There have been similar reductions in operating costs, with some new North Sea fields reporting costs as low as Pounds 1 a barrel, although about Dollars 5 a barrel would be the average for the central and northern North Sea. That is higher than in onshore fields in many parts of the world, but low enough to ensure that the UK continues to attract the interest of international oil companies. Political stability, proximity to markets and the UK's extensive oil infrastructure are additional attractions. So too is the government's attitude toward the industry, although oil companies were divided last year in their response to a sudden change in the government's taxation regime. It had the effect of removing relief on exploration, but lowering the tax rate on existing fields. That pleased companies such as BP and Shell, two of the biggest offshore operators with extensive but relatively high cost mature assets in need of refurbishment, but was less well received by aggressive explorers such as Amerada Hess, which has just joined the top five North Sea companies according to value of assets. There were suggestions last year that the tax changes were likely to cause some international companies to pull out of the North Sea. But there has been little evidence of that so far. Instead, many US companies, including Amerada Hess, say they want to expand their operations. Conoco of the US this month announced it intends to spend Pounds 400m a year in the UK offshore industry to the end of the decade. Such plans will please a government clearly enjoying the benefits of the present oil boom. Second-quarter oil trade, for example, was Pounds 1.31bn in surplus, its highest level in eight years and nearly three times higher than in the same period last year. This has helped to allay fears that Britain faces a worsening balance of payments as higher economic growth leads to increased imports. For how much longer can the sector maintain this performance? Most experts think output will peak sometime next year, before settling at a somewhat lower 'plateau' level. But that will still leave output above 2m barrels a day until the end of the decade, even if world prices remain depressed. A study this year by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based consultants, suggested that 59 fields likely to be considered for development over the next few years would be economic at the current price of Dollars 16 a barrel. In addition the government's latest licensing round showed strong interest in deep water areas west of the Shetland Islands and off the west coast of Scotland. That should ensure the North Sea continues to produce substantial amounts of oil and gas well into the next century.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Aber Resources, Commonwealth Gold and SouthernEra Resources described the results from their joint venture properties in the Lac de Gras area as 'encouraging.' They noted that micro-diamonds have been found in three of seven kimberlite deposits and that 30 targets remain to be tested. But SouthernEra's share price fell 70 cents on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday morning to CDollars 4.10. Dia Met Minerals, whose discoveries triggered the Northwest Territories' diamond rush last year, lost CDollars 1.50 on the Vancouver stock exchange to CDollars 37.50. Mr John Hainey, analyst at Canaccord Capital in Toronto, said the latest drilling results were 'clearly disappointing' and bore no comparison to Dia Met's encouraging gem diamond discoveries. He noted however, that the results were unlikely to quell the enthusiasm of companies that had flocked to the remote Canadian Arctic in an exploration frenzy rivalling any in North American mining history. Exploration work is continuing at a feverish pace with international mining groups such as De Beers and Teck Corporation continuing to stake new claims. De Beers has declined to disclose the results of its work. Mr Lee Barker, vice-president at SouthernEra, said he had been told that one of two targets drilled by the South African group drilled last autumn intersected a kimberlite pipe. Mr Barker put a brave face on Aber and SouthernEra's latest results. He said: 'We've proven that the cluster has the potential to host some diamonds. I'm as bullish about this as I was a year ago.' The Aber group plans to resume drilling in the spring. Mr Hainey said that surface samples obtained recently by two other companies, Pure Gold and Lytton Minerals, had also been encouraging.  ----------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------- Aluminium     +51,975   to   1,578,625 Copper         -26,62   to     315,775 Lead          +14,650   to     227,200 Nickel         +3,468   to      71,382 Zinc          +30,075   to     487,600 Tin               -20   to      15,365  -----------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Aber Resources.

0,FT933-4547 ,"FT933-4547 _AN-DIHB8AFGFT 930908   FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Demand from oil groups prompts services merger      By RICHARD WATERS      NEW YORK   ONE of the most broadly-based companies in the world oil services business would be created by the planned merger announced yesterday between the Texas-based companies Dresser Industries and Baroid. The all-share offer by Dresser, which values Baroid at around Dollars 850m, was prompted by the growing demand from oil and gas producers for broad-based service companies able to carry out all aspects of an exploration or drilling project. This practice of buying services as a package, which according to Dresser accounts for between 20 and 30 per cent of the market, enables producers to hold down costs and shift more of the project management risk on to service companies. Dresser and Baroid said the services they offered were largely complementary, giving them a broad-based business able to compete with the industry leaders Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, and Halliburton. However, the combined company faces potential anti-trust problems from its prospective share of the drilling fluids market. Through Baroid and M-I Drilling Fluids, a company 64 per cent-owned by Dresser, the two account for more than 50 per cent of the US and worldwide market in fluids. Dresser said it would comply with any directions from the anti-trust authorities to enable the merger to go ahead, including the disposal of part of the combined fluids business. In most other respects the Houston-based Baroid, with turnover last year of Dollars 614m, two-thirds of it overseas, will extend the range of services offered by Dresser, which in 1992 reported post-tax earnings of Dollars 121m on sales of Dollars 3.8bn. Directional drilling and measurement-while-drilling services, provided by Baroid's Sperry-Sun subsidiary, and remote-controlled submarine services both extend Dresser's range. Based on projected earnings from Baroid next year of between 45 and 50 cents a share - from 24 cents in 1992 and a projected 35 cents this year - the merger would only marginally dilute the value of Dresser shares, analysts said. Few cost savings are expected from the merger, though Dresser said the reduction in central overheads would cut costs by between Dollars 12m and Dollars 15m a year. Meanwhile, the development of integrated service companies could lead to an overall reduction in revenues for the sector. Mr Jim Carroll, an analyst at PaineWebber, said: 'It's a very good deal for the oil companies: by getting one company to cover all the services, they can achieve big discounts.' Dresser shares fell Dollars 1/2 on the news, to close at Dollars 22 1/4. Baroid's share price jumped by Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 8 3/8.   Companies:-  Dresser Industries Inc.     Baroid Corp.

THEY BLAME AN  EXCESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM. ACTIVISTS WORRY ABOUT AN ALASKA-STYLE OIL  SPILL.      By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      On the same day Exxon Corp. took a writeoff of $500 million for costs to clean  up oil spilled in the ocean, Chevron Corp. took a writeoff almost as large for  its costs of leaving oil underneath it.    Chevron said it would take the third and largest charge so far in 1989 related  to investment in the $2-billion Point Arguello project, an unsuccessful  10-year-old effort by a consortium of 18 oil companies to produce oil off the  coast of Santa Barbara. The project has become a symbol -- in the industry's  view -- of the costs of environmental activism and regulatory intrusion.    The San Francisco-based energy giant followed Texaco Inc. and Phillips  Petroleum Co., which reported smaller charges on their investments in the  project, which sits idle despite completion two years ago because of continuing  regulatory wrangling in the wake of the Alaskan oil spill. The partners are  paying out $100,000 a day in operating, salary and maintenance expenses,  Chevron said.    The writedowns are a final admission that ""in the present business climate . .  . the project is not worth the investment made,"" according to a Phillips  statement.    Chevron blamed an ""irrational"" regulatory process under which the project has  jumped through the hoops of 44 separate agencies and paid more than $100  million in environmental mitigation measures with no prospect of immediate  production.    Notwithstanding industry arguments, however, blame for the project's financial  problems may also lie with the overly optimistic projections of the oil  companies that came together more than a decade ago to develop an immense oil  field whose reserves are estimated at possibly 300 million barrels.    At the time the project was conceived in 1979, oil was in short supply and  selling for about $35 a barrel. By 1990, companies were projecting prices as  high as $85 a barrel -- about four times their current prices. The project was  planned with such prices in mind; executives now admit that they would have  vetoed the project had they foreseen prices around $22 a barrel, where they are  now.    ""If you want to spread the blame around, the oil industry blew millions of  dollars based on assumptions that oil prices would be a lot higher,"" said  Rosario Ilacqua, an industry analyst with Nikko Securities Co. in New York. ""I  think the economic decision was a mistake.""    Said one Texaco executive, who asked not to be identified: ""I think at the  time, it was the right thing to do. . . . The mind-set of the nation was to get  away from Arab oil and everyone was gung-ho about domestic reserves. . . . But  things change, unfortunately.""    Still, no one faults the oil companies for the delays that have drawn the  project out longer than anyone could have reasonably expected. ""The  environmental pressures tightened up directly in response to the Exxon Valdez  incident, and who the hell could have predicted that?"" asked William Randol, an  industry analyst with First Boston Corp.    The writedowns reported this month:    * Chevron, the lead partner in the consortium, took the largest writedown on  its investment in Point Arguello, reporting Wednesday a fourth-quarter charge  of $445 million. The writedown reflects only part of Chevron's estimated  $800-million investment in Point Arguello.    * Phillips Petroleum Co. said Jan. 17 that it would write down an estimated  $280 million after taxes on its offshore California investments, including  Point Arguello.    * Texaco Inc. said Jan. 18 that it would take a $164-million charge against its  exploration and production earnings for environmental costs and reduction in  the value of its investments. That charge included about $60-million in  after-tax writedowns for Texaco's investment in Point Arguello.    * Pennzoil Co. will report its earnings next week, but would not say whether it  will take a charge on its investment. Two years ago, Pennzoil took a  $225-million charge before taxes partly on investments in non-producing  properties including Point Arguello, said spokesman Bob Harper.    * Of the project's other major partners, neither Atlantic Richfield Co. nor  Oryx Energy Co. took writedowns on Point Arguello in 1989. Arco's main interest  is in the project's onshore facilities. Oryx, formerly Sun Oil, has a  relatively small investment in offshore production. Neither was hurt by the  delays as much as the larger partners.    Chevron and its partners paid more than $500 million in 1979 for the rights to  the Point Arguello offshore leases -- the most ever recorded for such rights.    Oil was discovered in 1981, and the consortium of oil companies invested more  than $2 billion to build three platforms -- Hidalgo, Hermosa and Harvest -- as  well as oil and gas pipelines, onshore treatment plants and a marine terminal.  The project was designed to process 100,000 barrels of oil and 60 million cubic  feet of gas a day.    In May, 1989, the last hurdle to full production was apparently removed when  Santa Barbara County issued a permit to allow tankering of oil from the  terminal at Gaviota to refineries in Los Angeles.    But in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, the Santa Barbara  League of Women Voters and a local citizens group, Get Oil Out, appealed the  permit to the California Coastal Commission, which in August revoked  permission.    ""Alaska showed us that our oil spill cleanup plan here was inadequate,"" said  Carole Ann Cole, a spokeswoman for Get Oil Out, who also invoked the memory of  the devastating platform blowout in the Santa Barbara Channel that fouled  beaches with oil in 1969.    In October, Chevron sued the Coastal Commission and reapplied for a tankering  permit. The county commissioned a study of the relative costs of shipping oil  by pipeline, which found that pipeline transportation would cost much more than  tankering; the county has now ordered a new environmental impact report.    As a result, it is increasingly unlikely that the project will begin production  before 1991, said Chevron spokesman G. Michael Marcy in Ventura.    Despite the delays and virtually no chance of net income from the project, the  oil companies continue to push for eventual production, hoping to realize at  least some cash flow to cover their initial investments. ""Obviously, most of  our costs are sunk and the money's been spent,"" said the Texaco executive.

0,FT943-3331 ,"FT943-3331 _AN-EINDHAF5FT 940914   FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lac loses fight for zinc-lead venture      By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent   A court battle between three big mining companies for control of the Lisheen project in County Tipperary, Ireland, the second-largest zinc-lead deposit in Europe, ended yesterday with defeat for the Canadian group Lac Minerals. This leaves the way clear for Ivernia West, a 'junior' Irish exploration company, to take control of the project. Ivernia's two biggest shareholders, each with 24.5 per cent, are Minorco, the offshore arm of the Anglo American-De Beers group of South Africa, and Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish group. Mr David Hough, Ivernia's managing director, said last night that he hoped his company could now turn away from the courts and concentrate on getting a mine into operation. It might be possible to start production towards the end of 1997, eventually achieving an annual output of about 200,000 tonnes of zinc and 30,000 tonnes of lead in concentrate. The dispute arose because Chevron, like many other international oil companies, is divesting itself of its mining interests and wants to dispose of its stake in the Lisheen venture. It agreed in September 1992 to sell to Lac, one of Canada's biggest gold producers, which also had ambitions to become established in base metals mining. But Ivernia West, which owns the minority interest in Lisheen, claimed to have pre-emptive rights over Chevron's 52.5 per cent. This claim was tested in the Irish High Court and Lac said yesterday that the court had ruled against it and said that Ivernia West did have pre-emptive rights. Lac said it would study the High Court judgment before deciding on any further action. An appeal is possibile, but Lac was recently taken over by American Barrick Resources, North America's biggest gold producer, and analysts said Barrick was unlikely to be interested in pursuing a zinc-lead venture. Minorco some time ago agreed to provide Ivernia with Dollars 72m (Pounds 46.4m) to buy Chevron's share of Lisheen and for Ivernia to sell 50 per cent of the ore body to Minorco in return for cancellation of the loan.  ----------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------- Aluminium            -11,800  to  2,401,550 Aluminium alloy          +40  to  25,760 Copper                  +675  to  370,075 Lead                  +3,400  to  368,175 Nickel                  +750  to  141,618 Zinc                     -50  to  1,236,900 Tin                      -35  to  31,880  -----------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Lac Minerals.

Latest statistics show that Daqing, China's largest  oilfield,  pumped 13.86 million tons in the period from January through  March--100,000 tons more than in the same period last year.    Daqing, whose output accounts for 40 percent of China's  total, will maintain annual production at more than 56 million  tons at least until 1995, and 50 million tons through the year  2000.    Chinese onshore oilfields produced 139 million tons of oil  last year.    In the first quarter of this year, the onshore oilfields  produced 34.33 million tons, up 0.58 percent over the same  period last year.    Output of the Liaohe, Xinjiang and Dagang oilfields during  the first quarter were, respectively, 3.6 million tons, up 5.4  percent; 1.95 million tons, up 10.4 percent; and 1.04 million  tons, up 4.1 percent.    However, production at some other major oilfields dropped as  expected. Most of the country's oilfields, concentrated in  Northeast and Central China, have been exploited for decades.    A senior official from the China National Petroleum  Corporation (CNPC) says he is confident production at the old  oilfields can be maintained. Onshore oil production for this  year is expected to be 140 million tons.    The official said measures will be taken to stabilize or  even  increase production.    CNPC, the country's largest oil firm, intends to beef up  investment and technology development in East China, with  approval from the central government.    Old oilfields in this region are expected to be the pillar  of  the country's petroleum industry until at least the year 2000.  CNPC's goal is to keep annual production in the East at more  than 124 million tons, the official said.    East China reports progress in discovering new oil reserves  and working out techniques to exploit heavy-oil reserves and  oilfields where geological conditions are used to limit  production.    In addition, equipment and expertise to develop shallow  offshore waters on the continental shelf have been worked out.    While trying every means to stabilize production in the old  oilfields, CNPC will accelerate exploration and development in  the Tarim, Turpan-Hami and Junggar basins in West China's  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Billions of tons of oil  reserves in the region are expected to benefit by the national  economy in the next century.     "
0,FT941-7261 ,"FT941-7261 _AN-EBYDJAEUFT 940225   FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Paying a high price for Being in Control - Robert Corzine on the costly demise of the old regional structure in favour of five new businesses / Way forward after pounds 1.65bn restructuring      By ROBERT CORZINE   No one familiar with the UK gas industry ever expected that the task of unravelling the largest integrated gas business in the West would come cheaply. But the Pounds 1.65bn exceptional charge and 5,000 additional job losses announced yesterday by British Gas was the 'mother of all restructuring charges,' according to one City analyst. Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said accounting practices prevented British Gas from phasing in the costs of restructuring over a prolonged period. 'We had to do it in the year in which the decision was taken,' he said. But some analysts suspect that the dramatic announcement may also have been a reminder to the government and to Ofgas, the industry regulator, of the practical implications of the decision last December to abolish, beginning in 1996, British Gas's monopoly on supplying 18m of Britain's 24m households. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided against breaking up the company, and decreed that only the gas transportation and storage business had to be separated by Chinese walls from the trading business. But senior executives decided that five separate business streams were needed to cope with increased competition. Some analysts also detected the influence of Mr Richard Giordano, the new executive chairman, in yesterday's announcement. Although he has assumed a low profile since taking over at the beginning of January and did not attend yesterday's presentation, his appointment was intended to be a catalyst for the radical change of British Gas' corporate culture as well as its cost base. In his written statement Mr Giordano conceded that 'a restructuring of this magnitude will be painful for some,' but ' . . . we will do our best to be fair and generous to those who leave.' The latest announcement brings to 25,000 the total number of job cuts to be made over five years, although most will disappear over the next three years, the company says. There has been scepticism among analysts that the company could actually meet previously-announced cost-cutting targets. But Mr Rogerson and Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, pointed to a fall in employee numbers at the end of 1993 to 76,453, from 82,146 previously, as proof that British Gas is actually implementing its plans. The demise of its old regional structure in favour of the five new national businesses should also help the company to meet cost-cutting targets, according to analysts. The regional structure was well suited to the last 25 years or so, during which British Gas expanded its share of the UK non-transportation energy market from 7 per cent to 50 per cent. But managers of the 12 regions resisted moves which would have eroded their power bases. 'The regions were run like little empires,' according to Mr Simon Flowers, analyst at Natwest Securities in Edinburgh. Severance and pension costs totalling Pounds 1.31bn form the bulk of the restructuring charge, virtually all of which will require cash expenditure, according to Mr Rogerson. The cost per head will be about Pounds 52,000, with pension provisions a quarter of that figure. Other redundancy-related costs include re-training and counselling. Some Pounds 50m has been allocated for training of staff who are staying but who will need to assume additional tasks. The personnel cuts will be made across the new business divisions, say officials. The physical division of the business units will cost Pounds 100m, with an additional Pounds 60m needed to cover payments for leased buildings which will no longer be needed. A total of 2,900 employees will need to relocate. Mr Brown dismissed criticism that action could have been taken much earlier to reduce British Gas's cost base, which will be cut by more than Pounds 600m a year as a result of the restructuring. He said radical action would have been taken much sooner had it not been for the prolonged period of uncertainty while the government decided on the future structure of the gas industry. 'We began looking at restructuring two-and-a-half years ago,' he said, 'but it would have been stupid if we had embarked on it without the clarity of the MMC and DTI decisions.' Mr Brown said it was still not possible to say how much emphasis the company would place on its non-regulated businesses, such as exploration and production and activities outside the UK. Ironically, whatever international strategy emerges is likely to stress British Gas's expertise as an integrated gas company, able to apply its various skills in all segments of the 'gas chain' from exploration and production to processing, distribution and marketing. But Mr Brown said: 'We need to know what the shipping charges and rate of return will be on our UK gas transport business before a clear international strategy can be determined.' Ofgas is to issue a consultation document on the subject in April, with a decision expected by October. The other big uncertainty facing the company is the way in which Ofgas intends to open the residential market to competition. One positive development noted by Mr Brown yesterday was an end to the animosity which marked British Gas's relations with its regulator over the past few years. It coincided with the appointment last November of Ms Clare Spottiswoode as the new Ofgas director general. 'Both parties are now listening to each other', said Mr Brown, who stressed that British Gas was only seeking 'a level playing field' with potential competitors. A consultation document giving detailed options for introducing full-scale competition in the residential market will be published within the next few weeks, with a firm decision on the way forward expected before the summer, when government lawyers will begin drafting a new Gas bill for parliament to consider. Only then will it become clear whether yesterday's action will be sufficient to put British Gas in control of its corporate destiny.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         REFIT FOR THE GAS MEN                         The new structure ....  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            BRITISH GAS PLC                              HQ: LONDON Sir Richard Giordano                                    Cedric Brown      Chairman                                          Chief executive  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Transport and storage MD: Mr Harry Moulson HQ: Solihull Gas transmission, distribution and storage for other units of British Gas and third party competitors on a fee basis.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Public gas supply MD: Michael Alexander HQ: Staines Supplying domestic and small commercial and industrial customers using under 2,500 therms a year.

0,FT942-6095 ,"FT942-6095 _AN-EFAEIAERFT 940601   FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Colombian find shores up Lasmo's bid defence      By ROBERT CORZINE   Lasmo, the independent explorer under siege from hostile bidder Enterprise Oil, yesterday shored up its defence by announcing the discovery of a new find in Colombia. The Revancha 1 well, which was tested at a rate of 6,200 barrels of oil a day, is just 3km from an earlier discovery. Lasmo estimated the combined recoverable reserves at between 50m and 150m barrels. Analysts said the new discovery could be worth some 2p to 5p on Lasmo's share price. But some speculated that finds announced during the bid process might eventually be scaled back. Colombia accounts for about 5 to 7 per cent of Lasmo's output. It has been cited by Enterprise as one of the areas which suffers because of Lasmo's heavy financial commitments elsewhere. Mr John Hogan, Lasmo's chief operating officer, acknowledged that development of the latest discovery was not in the budget. But 'there is always money available for good projects'. He noted that three more exploration wells for the area were in next year's budget. Full scale development is not envisaged before late 1995 or early 1996, by which time Lasmo will have completed its extensive capital programme to develop the Liverpool Bay gas field. The two discovery wells in Colombia are 5km from the Purifacacion field, from which Lasmo is trucking out 5,000 barrels a day. Mr Hogan said the expensive trucking operation, which analysts say can add up to Dollars 5 a barrel in costs, will end later this year when a pipeline with a capacity of 35,000 b/d is completed. Lasmo wants to achieve early production from the new discoveries to generate cash which will be used for the further development of the field. A temporary pipeline might be built to link the new discoveries to Purifacacion as early as next year, Mr Hogan said. Lasmo's 66 per cent interest in the block will fall to 30 per cent when it proves to be commercially viable and Ecopetrol, the Colombian state oil company, exercises its option to back into the deal. Lasmo yesterday retracted an earlier statement which claimed that: 'In the 1990s Enterprise has lost over Pounds 150m in international operations.' It acknowledged that the lossmaking operations mentioned did not include Norway, which '. . . was not lossmaking over the period'. Enterprise pointed out that Lasmo had 'chosen to ignore' 93 per cent of its international production. Norway last year accounted for turnover of Pounds 144m, against total international revenues of Pounds 154.6m. Enterprise has until the opening of the London Stock Exchange today to extend its Pounds 1.3bn bid. See Lex   Companies:-  Lasmo.     Enterprise Oil.   Countries:-  COZ  Colombia, South America.

The newspaper claims that the signing of a contract for oil and  gas exploration in the Wananbei-21 area between the Creston  Company of the United States and the (Hai Heng) Petroleum  General Corporation of China constitutes a violation of  Vietnamese sovereignty. It also demands the cancellation of the  contract and an end to all contract-related activities.    In 1992, the (Hai Heng) Petroleum General Corporation of  China and the Creston Company of the United States signed the  Wananbei-21 contract. This contract has legal authority. The  Wananbei-21 contract area lies within the Nansha archipelago  under Chinese sovereignty. The contract area is 25,155 square  km. The exploratory period under the terms of the contract is  seven years. During the period of contract, the contractor  concerned is resonsible for conducting seismic surveys and  exploratory drilling. The (Hai Heng) Petroleum General  Corporation of China and the Creston Company of the United  States have the right to carry out their normal tasks in that  sea area.    The (Hai Heng) Petroleum General Corporation entirely  rejects  Vietnam's aforementioned criticism and its absurd demand.    It should be pointed out here that in recent years, the  Vietnamese Oil and Gas Corporation has zoned off a number of  lots in China's Nansha Sea area and invited bidding from other  countries. Some foreign companies have signed contracts with it  for oil and gas exploitation. This constitutes a violation not  only of Chinese sovereignty in the Nansha Sea area but also of  the interests of the (Hai Heng) Petroleum General Corporation of  China.    The Chinese Government has on several occasions pointed out  that, pending the settlement of the dispute over the Nansha  issue, [the parties concerned] may temporarily set aside the  dispute and join in exploitation efforts. Therefore, the (Hai  Heng) Petroleum General Corporation of China will welcome any  efforts of the relevant corporations, including the Vietnamese  Oil and Gas Corporation, to cooperate with it in seeking the  possibilities of a joint oil exploitation.    The spokesman said: The (Hai Heng) Petroleum General  Corporation of China requests the Vietnamese Oil and Gas  Corporation to stop all acts that violate the legal interests of  the two aforementioned companies.

0,FT943-5598 ,"FT943-5598 _AN-EICAFAGWFT 940902   FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (13): Satellites the top priority - A look at spaceflight      By PAUL BETTS   On Sunday, July 20, 1969, US astronaut Neil Armstrong, commander of the spacecraft Apollo 11, became the first man to set foot on the moon. As he took his momentous first step he said: 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' But 25 years later, the dizzy excitement of space exploration fuelled by the race in space between the US and Russia has been replaced by the more mundane worries of an industry fighting like many others for continued public and government support to help fund its future development and challenges. Space has become a commercial enterprise, albeit a high-risk one, and many of its remarkable technological achievements are now taken for granted by a population more concerned about jobs and welfare than by new scientific discoveries and the prospect of human beings living and working in space one day. 'I find it rather sad to see around here a relatively small crowd of people. When I've been here in the past it was jam-packed,' said a senior executive of the Anglo-French Matra Marconi Space group. He was speaking moments before the launch in July at Cape Kennedy in Florida of the US shuttle Columbia carrying an international space laboratory inside its cargo bay. The launch was spectacular and successful. The shuttle was blasted into orbit in a great cloud of smoke for a 14-day mission when its seven crew, including Japan's first woman astronaut, conducted life science and other scientific microgravity experiments inside the Dollars 1bn laboratory. But it made little impact in the news. In the US, the big stories were the trial of a famous American football star, floods in Georgia, unemployment figures and the death of the North Korean leader. If the American newspapers relegated the mission to the inside pages of their newspapers, it was lucky to find even the briefest of mentions in the European press. Only the Japanese covered the story in full, reflecting the presence on board the shuttle of the first Japanese woman in space and the determination of Japan to build up a strong presence in the space sector. In Japan, the government space budget is continuing to rise while it is declining elsewhere. The latest victim of budgetary reappraisals in Europe is the Hermes project to build a European manned space vehicle. In the US, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is having to fight for funds every year and many of its space projects, especially the Dollars 30bn space station due to be completed by 2002 and involving broad international collaboration, are living on a budgetary knife-edge. With the emphasis now being placed increasingly on the commercial opportunities offered by space, governments, space agencies and manufacturers of space equipment have been concentrating on the satellite business, in particular for earth observation, meteorology and communications. Governments have also continued to show growing interest in satellites for military applications. The role played by satellites in the Gulf war has further boosted this interest. In turn, competition in the satellite and satellite launch business has intensified. The commercial battle has essentially pitted the US against Europe. In the commercial satellite launch business, Europe has managed to build a leading position during the past 14 years with Arianespace and its Ariane rockets. The French-led Ariane programme has done for the European space industry what the Airbus consortium has achieved in the civil aircraft field: the establishment of a credible competitor to the US dominance of commercial aerospace markets that lasted until the early 1980s. But although Ariane has now taken a share of more than 50 per cent of the commercial satellite launch market, it is facing tough competition not only from US launchers but also from Russia, China and Japan, all seeking to penetrate the western market. With a finite market of around 20 commercial satellite launches a year, the battle for market share has provoked increasing international trade tensions mirroring those in the commercial aircraft market between the US and Europe. The US have accused the Europeans of subsidising its rocket launcher industry, while the Europeans have accused the Americans of cross-subsidising commercial launch operations with their large military satellite market, which to all intents remains closed to international competitors. And both the US and Europe have campaigned against price dumping for satellite launches by the Russians and the Chinese and sought to negotiate trade agreements with these countries. Competition has been equally fierce in the satellite manufacturing side of the business. It has forced leading manufacturers to seek wider partnerships and has led to increasing consolidation in the industry. In Europe, two big transnational groups are being established to create the economies of scale necessary to compete in a tight market. The French Matra group has already merged its satellite activities with those of the UK General Electric Company into a joint venture called Matra-Marconi Space, which is 51 per cent held by the French concern. Matra-Marconi Space is now acquiring the space systems division of British Aerospace in a deal which would create a European space group with annual sales of more than Dollars 1bn. At the same time, Deutsche Aerospace, the aerospace arm of the Daimler-Benz car group, is negotiating to merge its space operations with those of Aerospatiale, the French state-controlled aerospace company. But if the prospects for the satellite business remain secure, even though it is likely to face increasingly competitive pressures, the future of manned space flights continues to be clouded with uncertainty. NASA officials concede that the fate of the US space shuttle will hinge on whether the US-led programme to build an international space station will survive or suffer from government budgetary cuts. The Dollars 30bn project is designed to create a permanent orbiting science institute in space capable of performing long-term research in materials and life sciences in a gravity-free environment. NASA says that this fundamental research will accelerate breakthroughs in technology and engineering that will have practical applications on earth. 'What governments must decide is whether you should continue supporting long-term fundamental scientific research and space exploration or simply go for short-term commercial pay backs,' said one senior US space industry official. The issue is now taking on, once again, an international political dimension. But in contrast to the race between the US and Russia 25 years ago when the two superpowers were competing to outmanoeuvre each other to take the leadership in space, they are now working increasingly together. NASA recently signed a Dollars 400m contract with the Russian space agency to support a joint programme involving the US space shuttle and the Russian Mir space station. The contract also covers co-operation in the planned international space station. This collaboration, which both sides see as consolidating the new post Cold War era, could prove to be the main driving force to keep alive the long-term ambitions of the international space industry.

LEE, Times Staff Writer      Guy Williams, the actor who starred in the popular 1950s television series  ""Zorro,"" has died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, authorities there said Sunday. He  was 65.    Williams' body was found by police Saturday in his apartment in the exclusive  residential neighborhood of La Recoleta. He apparently suffered a heart attack  and died about a week ago, the government news agency Telam reported. An  investigation was begun to confirm the exact cause of death.    The 6-foot, 3-inch second-generation Italian-American, whose real name was  Armando Catalano, was chosen by Walt Disney Studios to portray Zorro on the  small screen in a role made famous in motion pictures by Douglas Fairbanks Sr.  and later by Tyrone Power.    The television series recounted the adventures of Zorro and his alter-identity,  Diego de la Vega, a seemingly spoiled son of a Spanish aristocrat.    De la Vega presented himself, to the chagrin of his father, as a disinterested  and apathetic overseer of a ranch in the section of 1820s colonial California  that was to become Los Angeles. When confronted with injustice, De la Vega  secretly transformed into a Robin Hood-like defender of his countrymen against  the abuses of Spanish overlords.    Zorro identified himself to villains and victims with trademark bullwhip, black  mask, cape and -- perhaps most endearing to audiences -- his signature of using  his foil to ""make the sign of the Z"" at the site of an escapade.    Extensive previous training in fencing helped Williams get the part in the  series, which was produced from 1957 to 1959. It continues to run on the Disney  Channel.    Williams also starred as professor John Robinson in the 1965-1968 series ""Lost  in Space,"" portraying the patriarch of a futuristic family on a space  exploration mission gone awry.      Family in Space    The series followed the family in their sabotaged spaceship as they tried to  find their way home from a neighboring solar system.    Between the two television series, Williams starred in two movies that won him  little attention: ""The Prince and the Pauper"" in 1962 and ""Captain Sinbad"" in  1963.    The son of an insurance broker, Williams grew up in New York City, where he  attended public schools. After graduating from high school, he attended a  military academy. Williams' father wanted him to pursue an insurance brokerage  career, but Williams got into modeling and subsequently acting.    Williams was a frequent visitor to Buenos Aires and had apparently lived there  alone for the last several months.    Williams had two children with wife Janice Cooper, a former model.

LEE, Times Staff Writer      Guy Williams, the actor who starred in the popular 1950s television series  ""Zorro,"" has died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, authorities there said Sunday. He  was 65.    Williams' body was found by police Saturday in his apartment in the exclusive  residential neighborhood of La Recoleta. He apparently suffered a heart attack  and died about a week ago, the government news agency Telam reported. An  investigation was begun to confirm the exact cause of death.    The 6-foot, 3-inch second-generation Italian-American, whose real name was  Armando Catalano, was chosen by Walt Disney Studios to portray Zorro on the  small screen in a role made famous in motion pictures by Douglas Fairbanks Sr.  and later by Tyrone Power.    The television series recounted the adventures of Zorro and his alter-identity,  Diego de la Vega, a seemingly spoiled son of a Spanish aristocrat.    De la Vega presented himself, to the chagrin of his father, as a disinterested  and apathetic overseer of a ranch in the section of 1820s colonial California  that was to become Los Angeles. When confronted with injustice, De la Vega  secretly transformed into a Robin Hood-like defender of his countrymen against  the abuses of Spanish overlords.    Zorro identified himself to villains and victims with trademark bullwhip, black  mask, cape and -- perhaps most endearing to audiences -- his signature of using  his foil to ""make the sign of the Z"" at the site of an escapade.    Extensive previous training in fencing helped Williams get the part in the  series, which was produced from 1957 to 1959. It continues to run on the Disney  Channel.    Williams also starred as professor John Robinson in the 1965-1968 series ""Lost  in Space,"" portraying the patriarch of a futuristic family on a space  exploration mission gone awry.      Family in Space    The series followed the family in their sabotaged spaceship as they tried to  find their way home from a neighboring solar system.    Between the two television series, Williams starred in two movies that won him  little attention: ""The Prince and the Pauper"" in 1962 and ""Captain Sinbad"" in  1963.    The son of an insurance broker, Williams grew up in New York City, where he  attended public schools. After graduating from high school, he attended a  military academy. Williams' father wanted him to pursue an insurance brokerage  career, but Williams got into modeling and subsequently acting.    Williams was a frequent visitor to Buenos Aires and had apparently lived there  alone for the last several months.    Williams had two children with wife Janice Cooper, a former model. A son,  Steven, was born in 1952 and a daughter, Toni, was born in 1957.    There was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.      Obituary      WILLIAMS, GUY    "

China, which expects to assemble 3 million motor vehicles  annually within 10 years, badly needs new kinds of petrol that  can improve vehicle efficiency and reduce air pollution.    ARCO President Mike R. Bowlin said yesterday in Beijing he  is  in the country to conduct negotiations with Chinese government  officials.    ""We'll discuss the possibilities for the cooperation and  market of products to be manufactured,"" said Bowlin, who will be  ARCO's chief executive officer later this year.    China now has 8.3 million vehicles, which consume 25 million  tons of fuel a year. Most of the fuels contain lead.    ARCO, one of the major foreign oil cooperative partners of  China, is the top developer of low-cost petrol in the United  States.    Bowlin said the firm is also interested in coal mining and  generating electricity with coal and natural gas in China.    During his trip, Bowlin is expected to talk with Vice  Premier  Zou Jiahua, high-ranking officials from the State Planning  Commission, and senior executives from the China National  Petroleum Corporation, the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation (CNOOC), the China Petroleum Corporation and the  China Huaneng Group, a central-supported energy conglomerate.    A CNOOC official and Bowlin both announced that the two  corporations will join efforts to develop crude oil outside  China.    Bowlin said ARCO, whose revenues last year stood at $20  billion, will continue to target China as one of its key markets.    Although Bowlin came to China expecting only to conduct  negotiations this time, agreements are expected to be clinched  later in the United States.    ARCO began doing business with China in 1978 and has been  one  of the largest partners with Chinese oil firms so far. It has  already sunk $300 million into oil exploration in China and  expects its investment to increase by $1.2 billion by 1996.    ARCO has signed several contracts and agreements with  Chinese  for developing oil and natural gas in the South China Sea and  exploring for petroleum in the East China Sea.    According to the contracts, ARCO, together with CNOOC and  the  Santa Fe Company, are to annually supply Hong Kong with 2.9  billion cubic metres of gas beginning in 1996.    ARCO discovered the Yacheng 13-1 gas field, the largest  offshore field in China, which contains 100 billion cubic metres  of gas.     "

Mr Ismail al-Ramly, a water resources consultant to the United Nations, says that years of studying the agricultural potential of the sparsely populated Western Desert had convinced him of the potential of the desert oases. He estimates that the Farafra oasis some 400 km (250 miles) south-west of Cairo offers the best prospects, with sufficient water to cultivate about 200,000 acres of land, compared with the present 10,000 acres. Bahariya, some 100 km closer to Cairo, was also a good candidate for vastly increased cultivation from the present about 10,000 acres to a potential of 100,000. The Siwa oasis towards the Libyan border could also support much increased cultivated acreage, Mr Ramly says. The Egyptian expert says that his studies have established that, contrary to theories advanced earlier this century, Egypt's desert water resources are 'self-contained.' In other words, desert aquifers are not re-charged with water from surrounding Libya, Chad or Sudan. Rather, he believes that the water comes from seepage from the Nile at Qena in Upper Egypt where the river forms a giant 'S'. This water has made its way west along 'tectonic zones' to aquifers under what is known as the 'great sand sea' towards the Sudanese and Libyan borders. Mr Ramly has also identified promising areas in the northern approaches to the Dakhla and Kharga oases, south of Farafra and Bahariya. But as yet little detailed work has been conducted in those areas. Investigation of Western Desert water resources has been helped by an enhanced oil exploration programme. Data from oil drilling has enabled Mr Ramly to build up a fairly comprehensive hydrological picture that would not have been possible otherwise because of the cost involved. He estimates that water resources available to Bahariya amount to about 1.8bn cu m, sufficient for 300 years of cultivation. He has yet to complete his evaluation of Farafra. Western desert water is of excellent quality, he says, and compares favourably with that of the Nile. Mr Ramly says large-scale agricultural development of the western desert would require big investments, but he is convinced the returns would be there. For the Egyptian government, struggling to accommodate its growing population within the confines of the Nile valley and delta and to reduce its dependence on food imports, utilisation of the western desert oases may make sense - if the tapping of deep desert aquifers is cost efficient.

Kennecott, whose activities in Canada consist mainly of joint ventures with junior exploration companies, has teamed up with Aber Resources in the area centred on Lac de Gras, about 350 km (220 miles) north-east of Yellowknife, the territories' capital. In exchange for investing CDollars 10m (Pounds 4.3m) over the next five years, Kennecott has obtained a right to a 60pc interest in the project. The Canadian mining industry has been buzzing with rumours about a rich diamond deposit since last November when Dia Met Minerals, another junior company, announced that it had found some small stones under Lac de Gras. BHP-Utah Mines, a subsidiary of BHP of Australia, has rights to a 51 per cent interest in the Dia Met property. Share prices of Dia Met, Aber and other companies involved in the hunt have rocketed on the Toronto and Vancouver stock exchanges. Dia Met said in May that a sample of 160 tonnes of ore yielded at least 90 carats of diamonds, of which about a quarter appear to be of gem quality. Mr Ed McLeod, mining recorder for the Department of Energy and Mines in Yellowknife, said yesterday that sales of claim tags for the Lac de Gras area increased sharply in May and June. A total of 4,243 claims covering 9.6m acres, or 15,000 square miles, were staked by July 15. Another 3,900 sets of tags, each entitling the holder to one claim, have been sold. Mr John Stephenson, president of Kennecott Canada, said evaluation work was still in a 'very early' stage. He said that RTZ might issue more details of its work at Lac de Gras within the next few days. Monopros, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of De Beers, is understood to have expanded its presence in Canada in recent months as a result of the activity in the Northwest Territories. An official of the company, which is based in Toronto, said that it had just started a sampling programme - the first stage of on-the-ground investigation - in the Lac de Gras area. Exploration has also accelerated in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Besides Monopros, the most active prospectors in Saskatchewan are Uranerz of Germany and Cameco, the large Canadian uranium producer. The focus of their attention is an area close to Prince Albert, in the centre of the province.  The Financial Times   London Page 24  "

The US energy group's 19 per cent rise in net income for the period, compared with the previous year, came against a backdrop of lower oil prices which has held back earnings at other oil companies. 'These strong earnings were generated despite soft worldwide economic conditions, weak crude oil prices, and provisions associated with the tax rate increase in the US,' said Mr Lee Raymond, chairman. Net income for the period rose to Dollars 1.36bn, or Dollars 1.09 a share, from Dollars 1.15bn, or 91 cents, on sales down to Dollars 27.9bn from Dollars 30.6bn. On Wall street, Exxon's shares rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 , by early afternoon. While exploration and production profits in the US remained flat, at Dollars 273m, overseas earnings in this area jumped to Dollars 549m from Dollars 468m. US downstream operations, on the other hand, recorded an increase to Dollars 121m from Dollars 31m, while overseas earnings rose only slightly to Dollars 474m. Falling oil prices, while holding back upstream earnings in the US, had been more than offset by the improvement in margins in petroleum products that resulted from cheaper oil, Mr Raymond said. Exxon said the results benefited from lower operating costs, the effects of its asset management programme, under which it sold assets which were marginal or did not fit its long-term plans, and lower tax rates in some overseas countries. Atlantic Richfield (Arco) said net income in the third quarter fell to Dollars 68m from Dollars 332m in the previous year due to the increase in the US corporate tax rate and the cost of settling a legal action. The results were held back by an after-tax charge of Dollars 115m resulting from the effect of the tax rate rise on deferred taxes. The company recorded after-tax charges of Dollars 50m against the costs of litigation. These mostly related to the decision by the US Court of Appeals to confirm a judgment against the company in a class action suit over breaches of energy pricing regulations between 1973-81. Earnings per share fell to 42 cents from Dollars 2.06, on sales down to Dollars 4.55bn, from Dollars 4.83bn. Arco is to reorganise some of its oil and gas operations, resulting in a 'substantial' charge to fourth-quarter earnings, Reuter adds. The group said that it expected to cut between 900 and 1,000 jobs by the end of the transition period. The reorganisation of Arco Oil and Gas Co should result in annual after-tax cost-savings of about Dollars 100m, the company said.   Companies:-  Exxon Corp.     Atlantic Richfield Co Inc.

Anyone who has worked for decades in this mysterious field  feels, together with relief and a feeling of bitterness, that  too many years have been spent in a routine of prohibitions and  inflexible restrictions.    I will not undertake to judge the advisability of the  decisions made a half century ago--the all-embracing  classification of that vast body of human and physical resources  which was put into effect at the dawn of the atomic problem. I  know only that not one of the countries outside the socialist  camp has taken such a step. We must think that we are not the  last ones for purely economic reasons, in order to avoid the  huge unproductive expenditures, to maintain an army of  protectors and the inevitable informers in secret matters. All  the same, the leak of information is already substantial when  there are two who bring it instead of one, unless they are truly  isolated from the outside world, of course. But hundreds of  thousands, if not millions of people, have been counted here.    In 1954, when a program of searches for uranium was  undertaken on a wide scale, a geological technician with a  radiation meter joined our coal geological exploration party in  Ryazan Oblast. And in the core sample of one of the boreholes  selected for measurement, in a plain layer of clay on the side  of the coal-bearing area, a high concentration of uranium was  suddenly discovered. Soon after, controlled drilling was begun  under conditions of strict secrecy. The trust employees stood  watch at the drills and collected and documented the cores, and  we just provided the drilling process. To the puzzled questions  why we were drilling where there is obviously no coal and in a  system that was unprecedentedly dense, the response was for the  needs of the trust, ""but I do not know what kind."" While the  slyly smiling drilling foreman once revealed that his mother had  brought home a tale from the market that geologists had found an  ""atom"" under the village of Zheltukhino.    How can we help but remember the immortal adage, over  200 years old, uttered by the observant Madam de (Stal) after a  trip to our country: ""In Russia everything is a mystery and  nothing is a secret."" The instructional song of the miner  leaving for a health resort could also have been included in the  Vysotskiy repertoire by the head of the first division of the  uranium mine. Quiet Yakov Davidovich Gotman, an honored figure  in science and technology, one of the pioneers of Soviet uranium  geology and discoverer of the unique Aldan uranium mining area  in southern Yakutia, has recounted the absolutely fantastic  story about the information leak. In the late 1940's, he was  sent along with S. Yershov, the deputy minister of geology, and  his colleague B. Petrushevskiy, to Central Asia on assignment.  On the next day, the ""Voice of America"" reported the departure  of three specialists from Moscow for the Central Asian uranium  deposits.    After the country acquired its atomic and thermonuclear  weapons, through the selfless labor of its specialists and with  a little help from the prospectors who were just as selfless,  and was able to stockpile enough of them to annihilate all life  on the planet, secrecy in the geology of atomic raw material was  turned into an indisputable absurdity. But the screws were  tightened even more.    In the first decades of the uranium boom a researcher  working  in the atomic energy field could publish scientific works which  did not deal with uranium with all the publication data,  including the name of the organization in which he was working.  But if reference was made to articles on uranium geology,  mention of the subject of one's research and its geographical  location, as well as one's place of work, was prohibited. The  routine of a scientific institution was also considered a big  state secret, and Anatoliy Shcheranskiy, as we know, paid with a  13-year sentence in the camps at the end of the Brezhnev era for  allegedly divulging such information.    From the mid-1970's, after achieving parity with the United  States, the ban on indicating one's place of work was extended  to all scientists who were working with uranium. Even if the  author of a completely harmless article did not mention uranium  in previously published works. Even when secrets which they  endeavored to safeguard were lost because of circumstances, this  did not stop those in control of universal secrecy. After the  Prague spring was smothered, the head of uranium geology in  Czechoslovakia, Vladimir Ruzhechka, did not return home. In a  book published in Canada in the mid-1970's, he revealed the  uranium resources not only of Eastern Europe, but the Soviet  Union as well. But like a mosquito which continues sucking blood  by inertia when its belly has been cut off, so the illuminated  skyscraper of domestic secrecy has continued to increase the  number of its stories.    The closed nature of the sector was convenient for the  uranium barons to a large extent, making it easier to pump huge  budget appropriations into it. The overexploration of deposits,  linked chiefly with the faulty planning system, which is  inconceivable in other countries, is typical for Soviet geology  as a classic cost-based branch of the economy of socialism.  Wages and bonuses depended not on specific results, but the  running meters of drilling, the cubic meters penetrated, and so  forth. Thus the effectiveness of geological exploration  operations turned out to be less advantageous for collectives  than increasing their volumes.    It is unlikely that the almost unknown venture involving the  mobilization of vast sums and numbers of people in completely  unprepared searches for uranium in the Kodar Range in  northeastern Chita Oblast would have been possible without  absolute secrecy. Based only on a highly radioactive piece of  rock with absolutely no geographical connection (such specimens  are called ""sobakity"" in geological terminology) which was sent  to Moscow, they quickly sent out two camps of prisoners into the  unpopulated high mountains under severe conditions in the late  1940's, and urgently put together a specialized geological  exploration expedition and a second expedition to conduct  scientific support for the operations, organized from scientific  associates of the Leningrad Geological Institute, who were to  remain at the site the year round. At the same time, they  shipped out heavy equipment and began drilling, tunneling, and  so forth in an area that had been given absolutely no geological  study. In the wilderness of the mountainous taiga, out of touch  with communications, the prisoners immediately began erecting  the buildings of a new town. The materials needed were taken in  by a winter road, and by aircraft the remainder of the year. The  results turned out to be poor--at the cost of much effort and  many lives, they found only a number of small signs of ore,  unsuitable for industrial exploitation.    The army of specialists who provided their intellect and  hard  labor and often lost their health to develop the country's  uranium base were the victims of this secrecy. They were  prohibited from traveling abroad, even to ""fraternal countries,""  and from contacts and correspondence with foreign colleagues,  which scientists need like a person needs air. Without  convincing explanations, authorization to participate in  international conferences could be refused, even when they took  place in the USSR, and even when personally invited with a paper  which did not lead to complaints.    When my article on important aspects of the theory of ore  formation, whose conclusions were based on Ilya Prigozhin's  assumptions about the lack of equilibrium in thermodynamics,  appeared in one of the scientific journals, I decided to send a  reprint to the Nobel laureate and soon after received a warm  letter from him, a copy of his last monograph, and an invitation  to visit him at the institute in Brussels.    Dreams about a trip were obviously illusory at that time.  But  it would really be up-to-date for an outstanding scientist of  modern times to publish support for his scientific ideas. It was  during those very years of exhausting opposition from the  powerful (not in number, but opportunities) group of scientific  opponents headed by V. A. Zharikov, the current  academician-secretary of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences],  who was no less omnipotent then as the chairman of the VAK  [Higher Degree Commission] and who successfully blocked my  certification for the doctor of sciences degree for almost 20  years.    Nevertheless, I preferred to remain silent, for the fact  that  I had exchanged letters with a foreign scientist could have been  harmful.    The restrictions on movement and contacts were imposed on  participants in the American atomic project as well. But unlike  our bureaucracy, these restrictions were extended equally to  everyone, from Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the project, to  the ordinary technician. But our uranium ""generals,"" who  possessed incomparably greater information under the ""secret""  classification, very calmly traveled throughout the world. The  wives of the high officials working in the uranium field also  had the same privileges.    The Americans were generously compensated with additional  payments for the inconveniences related to the restrictions.  Additional payment ""for secrecy"" was also stipulated for Soviet  uranium employees by some ancient classified government decrees.  But in accordance with the classicial laws of the Kingdom of  Distorting Mirrors, the payments were received by the directors,  their deputies, chief accountants, and employees of the first  divisions, that is, the ones who forgot long ago how to hold a  geologist's hammer--or never did know how, or how to walk the  hills and dales with a radiation meter and through mine  workings, or to study the radioactive rocks under a microscope.    The farfetched secrecy, in accordance with the laws of  feedback, has hit the system which gave rise to it as well.  There is a wide conviction that the criminals sentenced to death  are not shot but sent to the uranium mines, where they soon die.  This is all a fantasy. Throughout my working life I have spent  innumerable shifts underground not only in uranium mines, but  coal, cobalt, molybdenum, and gold workings as well. I am  prepared to attest to the fact that I never encountered more  comfortable conditions than in uranium mines. A well organized  and strictly controlled ventilation system that provides for  work safety, workings at one's full height, not manholes for  ""abdominal movement,"" and a large number of showers on the  surface, maintained in model sanitary condition...    Of course, the all-powerful Minsredmash [Ministry of Medium  Machine Building] was not ashamed to make use of the convicts'  forced labor on a wide scale. But just in construction and  auxiliary operations. The prisoners were not underground. They  were not needed there, and the uranium mines did not experience  a shortage of a mining work force. Many were attracted there by  the exemplary work conditions, the higher earnings, and the  well-equipped housing with which the ministry's towns and  settlements were always provided. In addition, the radioactivity  of even the rich natural ores is incomparable with the enriched  uranium from the reactors of nuclear power stations, the deadly  radiation which is erroneously attributed to the mines. If one  is looking for places suitable for prisoners condemned to death,  one should look in the coal mines, with their unacceptably low  level of safety equipment.    But what comes with the declassification of uranium, aside  from a belated quiet satisfaction? Its features as a more  ""cosmopolitan"" environment than other ores help to ""get into""  the general natural laws of ore formation. So the tens of  thousands of volumes of handwritten reports by Soviet uranium  workers with the most extensive information, which continue to  remain behind the steel doors of the geological funds, are truly  the property of world science. The titanic intellectual labor of  several generations of specialists, which is capable of standing  up to the competition in any market of scientific knowledge, is  concentrated in them. The only question is whether we are really  able to enter these steel doors.     "

Mr. Filimonov believes that ""the competition was conducted to  the detriment of Russian oil men"" and that the Swiss IMEG  Management S.A. consortium was announced as the winner of the  competition on the basis of unwarranted advantageous rules.  According to Mr. Filimonov, he found out about this competition  only a month before the results were announced and, therefore,  Tomskneft was not able to participate in it. Representatives of  the Geointertek Joint Enterprise, the company that conducted the  competition, told correspondent for KOMMERSANT-DAILY that the  rules governing the competition did indeed change somewhat over  a period of two years, but that the Joint Enterprise did not  hide this fact. According to Geointertek representatives, this  competition was, on the whole, not very attractive to investors,  because the development of disputed deposits would probably be  unprofitable.    The Strange History of the Competition    The first international tender for the barely-explored  Pudinsko-Parabelskiy deposits was presented in the city of  Denver (USA) back in the summer of 1992. At the time, packets  with geological information for tender applications were  purchased by seven foreign companies, and the first results were  to have been received in January 1993. Several companies,  however, in anticipation of preferential tax rates from the  Russian government, asked that the tenders be delayed until July  1, 1993. Preferential rates were not received by that time, and  the tenders--due to unprofitability of the project for foreign  investors--were not offered.    In March 1994, however, after Boris Yeltsin's decree of  December 24, 1993 (""On Issues of Agreements Regarding  Allocations of Production in Using Mineral Resources""), which  changed the tax policy in the oblast, this competition again  became attractive to investors. For this reason, in March of  this year the Tomsk Oblast administration announced an  ""extension"" of the competition with all the former rules still  in effect.    These rules were rather strict. The entire competitive  territory was divided into 20 parcels--""blocks""--and  applications for ""a territory less than one block in size"" were  not accepted, but the amount of the bonus was calculated on the  basis of each square kilometer of a block. It was also assumed  that bonus payments would be made immediately after the results  of the competition have been made known, but in the event a  contract was not signed with the winner, the Russian side had  the right to keep 20 percent of the bonus as a security payment.    Nevertheless, as a result of the competition, the  winner--the  IMEG Corporation--received only parts of the 9th, 10th, and 17th  competitive blocks, the territory of which has known oilfields  amounting to 23 million tonnes. According to data from experts,  these are the most convenient ""pieces"" for which other  companies--that had intended to participate in tenders back in  1992--could have fully competed.    Requests to clarify what the bonus consists of were not  fulfilled either; for example, that a part of the sum was  definitely a security payment. According to the results of the  competition, the consortium is obligated to pay $2.5 million out  of its bonus only ""when an agreement has been signed and  implemented between the Russian and foreign parties,"" and  another $6 million of the bonus to be paid to ""the Tomsk Oblast  fund for social support when a certain level of extraction of  hydrocarbons has been achieved, which will constitute a subject  for negotiations."" According to experts, thanks to the  afore-mentioned ""negotiations,"" the payment of most of the bonus  can be simply delayed for an indeterminate period of time.    [Boxed item]    The Pudinsko-Parabelskiy part of Tomsk Oblast is in the  south  and center of the oblast. It is divided into 20 sections--blocks  that range from 2,000 to 6,000 sq meters each. Approximately 20  deposits of oil and gas are found here. Oil reserves that can be  extracted from them range from 0.4 to 4.0 million tonnes and  more. It has been admitted that development of these oilfields  is not profitable for the Tomsk Oblast oil refineries, but  profits could be made if modern Western technology were to be  used. The total amount of reserve oil that can be extracted for  industrial purposes in the Pudinsko-Parabelskiy area is 28.6  million tonnes; average reserves of oil in the oilfields is 1.6  million tonnes; extractable reserves of gas condensates total  13.1 million tonnes; and extractable reserves of gas total  72,346 billion cubic meters. From a geological perspective, only  30 percent of this section has been studied.]    The Oblast Administration Is Happy With the Results of the  Competition    Only two companies participated in the last competition. The  second one, the Russian Konventsiya Joint Stock Company  together, with its co-investor, the Norwegian firm Skaninvest  (Scandinavian International  Investment), did not provide  information about its financial and technological capabilities.  In addition, Konventsiya proposed $2.2 million in bonus payments  and $10 million for conducting geological exploration work  during 1994-95 in an area of 7,400 square kilometers.    Meanwhile, the IMEG consortium pledged to pay a bonus of  $8.5  million, as well as to spend a minimum of $46 million only on  exploration of deposits in an area of 2,870 sq kms during the  first five years. According to the IMEG proposal, the Russian  share of the project's profits would be 64-66 percent.    According to Vladimir Ponomarenko, first deputy chief of the  Tomsk Oblast Administration, IMEG's victory in the  competition--one condition of which was participation in  developing new deposits for the Tomskneft Joint Stock Company  and the Tomskneftegazgeologiya State Enterprise--will result in  creating new employment, saving the geological service, and  implementing a program for supplying the oblast with gas. In  addition, the Russian side is counting on receiving 25 percent  of the extracted raw material and, moreover, around two thirds  of all payments tied to exploration and development of deposits  will remain in the oblast. The oblast administration estimates  that capital expenditures alone by foreign investors to  implement this project will amount to $300-400 million. A  significant portion of this money will ""settle"" in the oblast.    Tomskneft Is Not Happy With the Results of the Competition    Leonid Filimonov, general director of Tomskneft, announced  at  a press conference, that the day before he had had a ""tough  talk"" about the results of the competition with Viktor Kress,  head of the Tomsk Oblast Administration, who had signed off on  the results of the competition. Mr. Filimonov declared that he  found out about the competition only one month before the  results were announced. So, even if Tomskneft had participated  in the competition, it could not have prepared itself well  enough to compete with the foreigners. More than anything else  with regard to the results of the competition, Mr. Filimonov was  indignant about the fact that a foreign concern became the owner  of a license to develop the territory. Mr. Filimonov believes  that the administration should have given ""a priority to local  forces, to the union of oil men, oil technicians, and  geologists, and then we could have invited foreigners..."".    The head of Tomskneft declared that he ""thinks that the  consortium will not invite me to work, but will invite its own  foreign workers."" In his words, Tomskneft ""is the enterprise  that we are establishing to supply the oblast with gas, and it  should receive a priority license for exploring deposits.""    [Boxed item]    Over the last two years this is already the second scandal  revolving around Russian tenders, organized by the Geointertek  Joint Enterprise.    On November 20, 1992, KOMMERSANT-DAILY wrote that a certain  Commission for Financial and Legal Control and Struggle Against  Corruption, under the then Premier Yegor Gaydar, had been  checking the results of oil tenders in the Republic of Komi,  organized by Geointertek. The competition was won by the  American Occidental Oil Company, which pledged to pay a bonus of  $10.5 million. A check was written for the first $2.02 million.  However, as the Commission found out, in 1992 this money did not  go to Russia. Edvard Gendelman, deputy chairman of the  Geointertek board, deposited the entire amount of the bonus--in  two parts--in the account of the Central Bank in Denver. Then,  according to information from the Commission, ""notwithstanding  the demands of the Central Bank to transfer the given amount to  Russia,"" it was transferred to the account of the Nafta/UK/LTD  Company in the Indosuez Bank in London. But after five days, the  entire sum was transferred to the account of  Ukhtaneftegazgeologiya in Komi.    Members of the above Commission declared that this occurred  thanks to their efforts and pressure on the directors of  Geointertek. The results of the Commission's investigation were  handed over to the prosecutor and the Directorate of Internal  Affairs of Tomsk Oblast, but nothing came of the verification  that took place there.    Meanwhile, the directors of the Joint Venture itself do not  see anything illegal in any of these maneuvers with the $10.5  million. According to Mr. Teplitskiy's explanation, the bonus  was not supposed to be transferred to Russia prior to the  signing of the documents testifying to the results of the  competition. With regard to ""throwing"" the money to London,  well, this was done so that the money could be sent directly  from there to a bank in Komi. According to Mr. Teplitskiy, the  Joint Venture has statements from banks in Denver and London to  the effect that the money could not have been used in any way by  Gendelman. Mr. Teplitskiy believes that the efforts of Gaydar's  commission did not at all facilitate the transfer of the money  to Russia: ""It would have come without all that."" Incidentally,  by decision of the Komi Council of Ministers, for organizing  this competition the Geointertek Joint Venture received about $2  million that came out of the bonus payments.]    Organizers of the Competition Are Happy With Everything    Vladimir Teplitskiy, acting head of the Geointertek Joint  Enterprise, which conducted the competition, told the  correspondent for KOMMERSANT-DAILY that ""the scandal surrounding  the results of the competition was caused by political motives  and attempts by certain forces to compromise Governor Viktor  Kress.""    Mr. Teplitskiy insisted that the rules of the competition  were not violated, but simply changed over these past two years  and were related, in part, to conditions for paying out bonuses.  According to him, even under these new conditions Geointertek  had great difficulty in attracting the attention of foreign  firms towards this competition because the Ministry of Economics  had concluded that the development of these territories was  unprofitable. In any case, Mr. Teplitskiy admitted that studies  of this area were very weak and that it might be possible to  find large oilfields at deeper and older strata, which--for all  practical purposes--have not been studied here at all. Huge  investments are needed for this. For this reason, Mr. Teplitskiy  considers the results of the competition as a great victory, all  the more because the IMEG project will provide work to the  poverty-stricken Tomsk oil geologists.    Be that as it may, in addition to the term ""a block of  territory,"" the rules of the competition also had the term ""a  single block""--an area of 100 sq kms from which large blocks  were formed. According to Mr. Teplitskiy, it was not allowed to  subdivide precisely these single blocks, but any of the large 20  blocks could be subdivided. At any rate, he admitted that it was  possible to have a ""double meaning"" from reading this text.    In Mr. Teplitskiy's words, the announcement about renewing  the competition was published well in advance in the bulletin of  the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the Russian Geology  Committee, so anyone who was interested had time to participate  in the competition. It is true, he admitted, that nothing was  said about changes in the rules or conditions for the  competition in this announcement.     "

Anyone who has worked for decades in this mysterious field  feels, together with relief and a feeling of bitterness, that  too many years have been spent in a routine of prohibitions and  inflexible restrictions.    I will not undertake to judge the advisability of the  decisions made a half century ago--the all-embracing  classification of that vast body of human and physical resources  which was put into effect at the dawn of the atomic problem. I  know only that not one of the countries outside the socialist  camp has taken such a step. We must think that we are not the  last ones for purely economic reasons, in order to avoid the  huge unproductive expenditures, to maintain an army of  protectors and the inevitable informers in secret matters. All  the same, the leak of information is already substantial when  there are two who bring it instead of one, unless they are truly  isolated from the outside world, of course. But hundreds of  thousands, if not millions of people, have been counted here.    In 1954, when a program of searches for uranium was  undertaken on a wide scale, a geological technician with a  radiation meter joined our coal geological exploration party in  Ryazan Oblast. And in the core sample of one of the boreholes  selected for measurement, in a plain layer of clay on the side  of the coal-bearing area, a high concentration of uranium was  suddenly discovered. Soon after, controlled drilling was begun  under conditions of strict secrecy. The trust employees stood  watch at the drills and collected and documented the cores, and  we just provided the drilling process. To the puzzled questions  why we were drilling where there is obviously no coal and in a  system that was unprecedentedly dense, the response was for the  needs of the trust, ""but I do not know what kind."" While the  slyly smiling drilling foreman once revealed that his mother had  brought home a tale from the market that geologists had found an  ""atom"" under the village of Zheltukhino.    How can we help but remember the immortal adage, over  200 years old, uttered by the observant Madam de (Stal) after a  trip to our country: ""In Russia everything is a mystery and  nothing is a secret."" The instructional song of the miner  leaving for a health resort could also have been included in the  Vysotskiy repertoire by the head of the first division of the  uranium mine. Quiet Yakov Davidovich Gotman, an honored figure  in science and technology, one of the pioneers of Soviet uranium  geology and discoverer of the unique Aldan uranium mining area  in southern Yakutia, has recounted the absolutely fantastic  story about the information leak. In the late 1940's, he was  sent along with S. Yershov, the deputy minister of geology, and  his colleague B. Petrushevskiy, to Central Asia on assignment.  On the next day, the ""Voice of America"" reported the departure  of three specialists from Moscow for the Central Asian uranium  deposits.    After the country acquired its atomic and thermonuclear  weapons, through the selfless labor of its specialists and with  a little help from the prospectors who were just as selfless,  and was able to stockpile enough of them to annihilate all life  on the planet, secrecy in the geology of atomic raw material was  turned into an indisputable absurdity. But the screws were  tightened even more.    In the first decades of the uranium boom a researcher  working  in the atomic energy field could publish scientific works which  did not deal with uranium with all the publication data,  including the name of the organization in which he was working.  But if reference was made to articles on uranium geology,  mention of the subject of one's research and its geographical  location, as well as one's place of work, was prohibited. The  routine of a scientific institution was also considered a big  state secret, and Anatoliy Shcheranskiy, as we know, paid with a  13-year sentence in the camps at the end of the Brezhnev era for  allegedly divulging such information.    From the mid-1970's, after achieving parity with the United  States, the ban on indicating one's place of work was extended  to all scientists who were working with uranium. Even if the  author of a completely harmless article did not mention uranium  in previously published works. Even when secrets which they  endeavored to safeguard were lost because of circumstances, this  did not stop those in control of universal secrecy. After the  Prague spring was smothered, the head of uranium geology in  Czechoslovakia, Vladimir Ruzhechka, did not return home. In a  book published in Canada in the mid-1970's, he revealed the  uranium resources not only of Eastern Europe, but the Soviet  Union as well. But like a mosquito which continues sucking blood  by inertia when its belly has been cut off, so the illuminated  skyscraper of domestic secrecy has continued to increase the  number of its stories.    The closed nature of the sector was convenient for the  uranium barons to a large extent, making it easier to pump huge  budget appropriations into it. The overexploration of deposits,  linked chiefly with the faulty planning system, which is  inconceivable in other countries, is typical for Soviet geology  as a classic cost-based branch of the economy of socialism.  Wages and bonuses depended not on specific results, but the  running meters of drilling, the cubic meters penetrated, and so  forth. Thus the effectiveness of geological exploration  operations turned out to be less advantageous for collectives  than increasing their volumes.    It is unlikely that the almost unknown venture involving the  mobilization of vast sums and numbers of people in completely  unprepared searches for uranium in the Kodar Range in  northeastern Chita Oblast would have been possible without  absolute secrecy. Based only on a highly radioactive piece of  rock with absolutely no geographical connection (such specimens  are called ""sobakity"" in geological terminology) which was sent  to Moscow, they quickly sent out two camps of prisoners into the  unpopulated high mountains under severe conditions in the late  1940's, and urgently put together a specialized geological  exploration expedition and a second expedition to conduct  scientific support for the operations, organized from scientific  associates of the Leningrad Geological Institute, who were to  remain at the site the year round. At the same time, they  shipped out heavy equipment and began drilling, tunneling, and  so forth in an area that had been given absolutely no geological  study. In the wilderness of the mountainous taiga, out of touch  with communications, the prisoners immediately began erecting  the buildings of a new town. The materials needed were taken in  by a winter road, and by aircraft the remainder of the year. The  results turned out to be poor--at the cost of much effort and  many lives, they found only a number of small signs of ore,  unsuitable for industrial exploitation.    The army of specialists who provided their intellect and  hard  labor and often lost their health to develop the country's  uranium base were the victims of this secrecy. They were  prohibited from traveling abroad, even to ""fraternal countries,""  and from contacts and correspondence with foreign colleagues,  which scientists need like a person needs air. Without  convincing explanations, authorization to participate in  international conferences could be refused, even when they took  place in the USSR, and even when personally invited with a paper  which did not lead to complaints.    When my article on important aspects of the theory of ore  formation, whose conclusions were based on Ilya Prigozhin's  assumptions about the lack of equilibrium in thermodynamics,  appeared in one of the scientific journals, I decided to send a  reprint to the Nobel laureate and soon after received a warm  letter from him, a copy of his last monograph, and an invitation  to visit him at the institute in Brussels.    Dreams about a trip were obviously illusory at that time.  But  it would really be up-to-date for an outstanding scientist of  modern times to publish support for his scientific ideas. It was  during those very years of exhausting opposition from the  powerful (not in number, but opportunities) group of scientific  opponents headed by V. A. Zharikov, the current  academician-secretary of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences],  who was no less omnipotent then as the chairman of the VAK  [Higher Degree Commission] and who successfully blocked my  certification for the doctor of sciences degree for almost 20  years.    Nevertheless, I preferred to remain silent, for the fact  that  I had exchanged letters with a foreign scientist could have been  harmful.    The restrictions on movement and contacts were imposed on  participants in the American atomic project as well. But unlike  our bureaucracy, these restrictions were extended equally to  everyone, from Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the project, to  the ordinary technician. But our uranium ""generals,"" who  possessed incomparably greater information under the ""secret""  classification, very calmly traveled throughout the world. The  wives of the high officials working in the uranium field also  had the same privileges.    The Americans were generously compensated with additional  payments for the inconveniences related to the restrictions.  Additional payment ""for secrecy"" was also stipulated for Soviet  uranium employees by some ancient classified government decrees.  But in accordance with the classicial laws of the Kingdom of  Distorting Mirrors, the payments were received by the directors,  their deputies, chief accountants, and employees of the first  divisions, that is, the ones who forgot long ago how to hold a  geologist's hammer--or never did know how, or how to walk the  hills and dales with a radiation meter and through mine  workings, or to study the radioactive rocks under a microscope.    The farfetched secrecy, in accordance with the laws of  feedback, has hit the system which gave rise to it as well.  There is a wide conviction that the criminals sentenced to death  are not shot but sent to the uranium mines, where they soon die.  This is all a fantasy. Throughout my working life I have spent  innumerable shifts underground not only in uranium mines, but  coal, cobalt, molybdenum, and gold workings as well. I am  prepared to attest to the fact that I never encountered more  comfortable conditions than in uranium mines. A well organized  and strictly controlled ventilation system that provides for  work safety, workings at one's full height, not manholes for  ""abdominal movement,"" and a large number of showers on the  surface, maintained in model sanitary condition...    Of course, the all-powerful Minsredmash [Ministry of Medium  Machine Building] was not ashamed to make use of the convicts'  forced labor on a wide scale. But just in construction and  auxiliary operations. The prisoners were not underground. They  were not needed there, and the uranium mines did not experience  a shortage of a mining work force. Many were attracted there by  the exemplary work conditions, the higher earnings, and the  well-equipped housing with which the ministry's towns and  settlements were always provided. In addition, the radioactivity  of even the rich natural ores is incomparable with the enriched  uranium from the reactors of nuclear power stations, the deadly  radiation which is erroneously attributed to the mines. If one  is looking for places suitable for prisoners condemned to death,  one should look in the coal mines, with their unacceptably low  level of safety equipment.

0,FT933-3982 ,"FT933-3982 _AN-DIJB0AFYFT 930910   FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Gas static after better second quarter - Regulatory squeeze on margins and OFT requirement hits UK supply activities      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   ALTHOUGH the half year results of British Gas were little changed from the half-way point last year, the overall figures released yesterday masked a continuing change in the company's structure. As foreshadowed by a statement made at the time of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report last month, profits for the six months to June 30 on a historical cost basis were Pounds 634m compared with Pounds 637m a year earlier. That included a second quarter loss of Pounds 16m, a slight improvement on the corresponding quarter's deficit of Pounds 21m. The interim dividend remains unchanged at 6.4p. The result showed a fall in operating profit from UK gas supply from Pounds 809m to Pounds 742m because of the regulatory squeeze on margins and the Office of Fair Trading requirement that British Gas divest itself of a major portion of the industrial market. Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive, said that 59 per cent of the firm contract market and 17 per cent of the market for customers using more than 2,500 therms a year was now in the hands of the competition. Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said that overall gas sales were down 2 per cent, but the result included a benefit of Pounds 36m attributable to the slightly colder weather in the UK over the period. Regulatory actions cost the company Pounds 140m in the first half through enforced loss of market share and price controls. Against this, overseas gas supply raised its contribution from Pounds 94m to Pounds 123m, and exploration and production rose from Pounds 112m to Pounds 196m. British Gas is now active in Argentina and Canada, and expects to sign a major contract shortly in Trinidad. Mr Robert Evans, the chairman, said that the relaxation of the price formula recommended by the MMC 'will do little to restore the profitability of the UK gas supply business. Even with the major rationalisation which we intend to implement, profits from that business will not reach the levels achieved in recent years, and the adverse effects will be felt by the company as a whole.' He said the investment programme, which totalled Pounds 2bn last year, would have to be reduced. However, he believed that the structure proposed by the MMC would introduce 'a measure of stability and clarity' to the industry. British Gas has already warned that the changes being forced upon it will result in the loss of 20,000 jobs over three years. So far this year, 3,000 have gone, bringing the total down to 79,284.

We have now formed two oil and  gas exploration and mining zones. The Bach Ho field began  operations in 1986. Next to go on line was the Rong field, and  very soon, the Dai Hung field will begin supplying many millions  of tons of crude oil per year to the country. This is an  advantage for building and developing Vietnam's coastal economy.  This will attract investment and cooperation from many  countries. But this is also an area that various enemies have  their eye on.    With the new plots and stratagems of the imperialists and  other enemies, our coastal zones in general and our southeastern  coastal zone in particular will always be ""hot"" and very  ""sensitive"" zones. Other countries could and have encroached on  our sovereignty in this coastal zone:    Agreements have been signed with foreign corporations to  carry on oil and gas mining operations along our continental  shelf. But their goal is to gradually occupy the entire eastern  coastal zone. In the name of implementing the agreements, they  will use their naval forces to perform defense tasks and  regularly maintain strong naval forces in this zone with the aim  of creating tension and turmoil throughout it.    ""Scientific research"" and defense flotillas will be sent to  study and reconnoiter the situation along our coast. Ships and  civilian forces will be used to extract marine products around  the drilling zones, which will weaken security, interfere with  our mining activities, and at the same time give them an excuse  to start conflicts when necessary.    It will not be possible to eliminate the enemy's ability to  use limited naval and air forces to surround and isolate our  exploration and mining forces in coastal zones. They will then  be in a position to use offensive weapons to force us to abandon  our oil and gas exploration and mining activities. Although the  forces and combat formulas depend on each enemy, they usually  concentrate on having the advantage in terms of equipment and  weapons, launching fierce and sudden attacks, having  overwhelming strength, and presenting international opinion with  a ""fait accompli.""    The above analysis means that we must strengthen our ability  to defend our territorial sovereignty; protect our national  interests, natural resources, and environment; and defend those  who are living and working at sea. More specifically, we must  build a strong national defense potential at sea and in each  coastal area of the fatherland. We must mobilize the integrated  strength of the entire party, all the people, and the entire  military in the economic, political, national defense, and  security sectors. There must be unified targets and action plans  based on a common strategy and integrated macrocosmic plan of  the party and state regarding building, developing, and  defending our seas. There must be close coordination between  building and developing the economy and resolutely and ably  defending our territorial waters, protecting our natural  resources, maintaining security at sea, and forming a strong and  broad all-people's national defense and people's war front  throughout our territorial waters and in each coastal zone and  in each coastal locality. This front is a major process that  must be carried on regularly and continuously. The contents of  this process must be determined based on the situation and  tasks. It must constantly be improved with respect to  organizational structure, the forces must be deployed  rationally, and capabilities for defending the seas must be  strengthened with the cooperation of the forces existing at sea,  on the islands, along the coasts, and on land in order to  satisfy the requirements and complete the tasks.    In our coastal areas, there are more than 3,000 islands of  various sizes. Some of Vietnam's islands and archipelagoes are  located near the mainland, and others are located far away.  There are 26 coastal provinces and cities, and almost half of  the country's population and more than 6 million laborers are  concentrated in these coastal areas. Almost 240,000 people are  directly involved in making a living at sea in various sectors,  and we have 80,000 ships. Our country's system of islands, in  conjunction with the mainland, forms a multi-level defense  structure. If the entire country and each coastal locality  deploys forces and means rationally; coordinates economic,  national defense, and security matters well; and coordinates  activities at sea, on the islands, and on land closely, then  this will create an unbroken and strong national defense and  security front. This national defense front will be built using  the integrated strength of the entire country and all the  people. This is the basis for defending, protecting,  controlling, and mastering the ocean areas and the precondition  for scoring ""Bach Dang military achievements"" like our  ancestors. The lessons in defending the oceans show that one of  the most effective ways to affirm and implement sovereignty at  sea is to have forces constantly present to defend and exploit  the sea. At sea and on the islands, we must ""gradually exploit  the economic potential of the seas in all respects, develop the  economy on the islands, become masters of our territorial waters  and continental shelf, and exert our sovereignty over our  special economic zones."" [Footnote 3] [Strategy to Stabilize and  Develop the Economy and Society to the Year 2000, Proceedings of  the Seventh Party Congress] This is the direction for the entire  country and a pressing need for our fatherland's southeastern  coastal zone.    In building coastal defense zones, the state and many  coastal  localities such as Khanh Hoa and Ba Ria-Vung Tau have given  attention to strengthening the presence of people and forces  engaged in economic activities and scientific research at sea  and on the islands in these coastal zones. The number of SRV  citizens in the sea areas and in Truong Sa and Con Dao districts  has increased. This is a correct orientation that is aimed at  developing and protecting the economy in conjunction with  solidifying and expanding the national defense and security  front in our southeastern coastal area. But this population is  not large enough to exploit the strengths that exist in the  ocean and on the islands, and it has not really satisfied the  present national defense and security requirements in this area.  If the population of Con Dao District increases fivefold, the  fishing and marine products processing sectors can be expanded  greatly, the strengths concerning tourism and repair and  maintenance services can be exploited, fuel and food can be  supplied to ships, and the cultural and social spheres (schools,  hospitals, theaters, and so on) can be brought into balance. The  party and state and the sectors and localities should implement  favorable policies and practical measures to implement this  policy to enable Phu Quy, Con Son, and Truong Sa to develop in  all respects. That will be both a force for socioeconomic  development that is regularly present on the seas and that  affirms and enforces sovereignty, and a basis for organizing  militia and self-defense units and strengthening national  defense strength. At the same time, this will create the  preconditions for turning the islands and archipelagoes into a  frontline base that our armed forces can use to carry on  long-term operations at sea and to satisfy the combat  requirements when the weather is bad or when the enemy imposes a  blockade.    The state must soon promulgate ""regulations on exploiting  and  controlling the sea"" so that the people and forces at sea have a  legal basis to rely on and can effectively participate in  controlling the seas.    Building mass armed forces at sea is something that must be  given attention in the process of building an all-people's  national defense and people's war front at sea.    In the present multifaceted economic structure, we must  continue to study the organization of coastal militia and  self-defense forces in the economic elements in order to  maintain broad capabilities. However, the militia and  self-defense forces in the state and collective economic  elements must continue to serve as the activists. The localities  in these areas should study the experiences of Ba Ria-Vung Tau  and a number of other coastal localities in organizing the  militia and self-defense forces in the private economic elements  so that their own militia and self-defense forces are of high  quality. When organizing militia and self-defense forces, the  special characteristics of the occupations must be studied  carefully (day, night, seasonal activities), and the coastal  zones (fishing grounds) and activities of each force must be  determined so that the control zones can be organized and  divided in a relatively rational manner. In the southeastern  coastal zone, besides the fishermen from the six coastal  provinces in the zone, many fishing boats from nearby provinces  also come to fish in these waters. When organizing militia and  self-defense forces, attention must be given to this special  characteristic as well as to the fact that international  transport forces are sometimes present in the area in order to  regulate the fishing grounds, deploy the forces rationally, and  prevent sea areas from being left empty.    The use of the equipment and technical means of the forces  at  sea must be studied so that when necessary, they can be equipped  with the means to carry out their economic tasks and support the  military and national defense requirements. This includes  equipment to detect targets (fish), determine depths, fix and  guide targets on and under the water, and information and  observation means.    The naval, air, and other armed forces that are assigned sea  duties must be suitably organized and equipped, and they must  coordinate closely with the border units, coastal militia and  self-defense forces, and local armed forces on the islands and  on shore in accord with the economic and ocean control  regulations mentioned above and the orders of the Ministry of  Defense. The lessons in carrying on operations at sea show that  in order to ensure that the surface warships complete their  tasks, air defenses and electronic warfare must be strengthened.  Concerning this, the experiences in previous wars provide  valuable lessons that must be exploited and applied. The  problems is, we must strengthen training and constantly improve  the combat strength of each force in the joint front based on a  unified plan. As for the coastal militia and self-defense  forces, special attention must be given to providing training in  recognizing shapes and distinguishing targets, and they must be  given training concerning information technology and methods.  Along with training each force, a suitable amount of time must  be set aside for carrying on joint combat maneuvers between the  air force and navy and the other armed forces, the localities,  and the coastal and island defense zones based on determining  what situations might arise and formulating combat operations  plans based on those situations and based on each step from low  to high and from joint operations between two forces to many  forces. Then, the next step is to organize maneuvers involving  all the contents and requirements of building an all-people's  national defense front at sea.     "

He also took the opportunity to talk about oil  exploration and future projects.    [Begin Portal recording] We divided the island, both land  and  sea, into some 26 blocks to search for petroleum. We negotiated  with several companies to invest in this search. This is  related in one way or another to the energy crisis and the  national situation. Why do I say that? Because this is one of  the most difficult business ventures whereby foreign companies  risk tens of millions of dollars in investments in the first  phase and hundreds of millions in the second phase. In one way  or another, these companies have already invested more than $50  million in the Cuban oil business. The amount already invested  in oil exploration is close to $100 million. These companies  make investments. If they find oil they will recover their  investments, depending on the volume and quality of the oil  found. If it is a big field of good quality oil, 90 percent of  it is for Cubans and 10 percent is for the foreign company.  During the investment recovery period, the ratio is 50-50. Once  the investment is recovered in the first years, depending on oil  volume and quality. [sentence as heard]    Of the world's seven most industrialized countries --  meaning  the United States, Japan, Germany, and others -- three are  already investing in Cuban oil exploration; specifically,  France, Canada, and the UK. I do not think it is a secret that  the UK is the United States' most important ally. The UK is a  country whose parliamentary institutions, the House of Lords,  for instance, have publicly addressed its relations with Cuba.  It is interesting to see how some British politicians and  businessmen analyze U.S. policies toward Cuba and how they  perceive that the North Americans have two intentions toward us:  the obvious political intention to try to destroy the  Revolution at any cost, and the economic intention to prevent  other countries from investing here.    The British have taken a step forward. One company has  already hired an (?oil explorer). In short, there are four  countries investing here: France, Canada, the UK, and Sweden.    I am not talking about the U.S. Government. I am talking  about the U.S. oil tycoons and the U.S. oil, mining,  metallurgic, and tourism industries, which have expressed their  concerns about not being able to invest here. They are aware of  this and want to be allowed to invest here because they attended  the meetings we held in Calgary, Canada, and London, where our  comrades made offers. The U.S. companies obtained information  there and learned about what is going on in Cuba. In other  words, they are eager to invest here. I am not talking about  the U.S. Government, whose attitude is determined by other  considerations. But there is a great deal of interest on the  part of U.S. investors. We confirmed it. [end recording]    Minister Portal also explained to Cubans the methods and  techniques used to find oil.    [Begin recording] [Portal] We are currently searching for  oil  in all these blocks. We are using the seismic method in several  blocks. The seismic method is important because it uses the age  and geologic features of surrounding terrain to determine the  best place to explore. If nothing is found, there is no  drilling. This is the first step, a guiding point. Millions of  dollars are invested in the first step. We need specialized  ships for ocean exploration. High technology equipment currently  being used in Cuba is needed for land exploration. The country  has widely used this sophisticated equipment, which adds to the  information that we collected for many years with the former  Soviet Union during ocean and land exploration. We have seismic  information about the geological features of solid minerals and  oil. This information is very useful as we move forward so  quickly. Currently, we have [words indistinct] already hired.    As for the seismic method, we have found formations similar  to those found in other oil-producing countries in some blocks.  These structures must be drilled. Drilling is already under way  at sea. In the next few days, these companies will start  drilling on land. If there were no possibility of....[pauses]  The drilling shows if underground sedimentary rocks that are  about the same age as rocks found in other oil-producing  countries and which are constantly moving as the earth ages are  oil rich or not. There is no doubt that Cuba has oil. It has  enough oil to produce 1.2 million tons this year, and there are  possibilities of producing even more in the future.    That is all I can tell you for the time being about the  seismic method. I repeat: Drilling in those places is already  under way. We no longer have abstract hopes; we now have  tangible hopes.    [Unidentified reporter] What type of hopes...    [Portal, interrupting] I also want to say that if there is  an  oil well, we must determine how much oil it has and then build  three or four more wells, depending on oil volume estimates.  Then we can begin tapping oil. This operation could last two  or three years depending on the features of the place.    These companies perform other tasks that give us an idea of  how promising the Cuban oil industry is. The old Soviet  technique was used in old oil wells that are now being tapped by  foreign companies. Such companies have taken wells that used to  produce 30, 20, 15, or 10 tons of oil and, using modern  technology, significantly increased production to 60, 70, or 80  tons of oil in some wells. This increase that Cuba would never  have been able to produce is shared with that company. Base  production, however, is not shared; it remains ours. It is  shared if production increases. The Cuban oil industry has many  possibilities, and we are enjoying them. Every time you conduct  this type of business in the oil and nickel industry, in mining,  in the search for precious metals, or in tourism with non-U.S.  companies, you feel pleased. It is more than pleasure; it is  the certainty that we will not have to conduct this type of  business with U.S. companies only. [end recording]    Portal also talked about the trust that foreign investors  have in doing business with Cuba.    [Begin Portal recording] These companies have noticed that  we  Cubans are loyal. Cuban loyalty is already a tradition. We are  loyal even to our African ancestors. Regardless of whether the  United States lifts the blockade, serious capitalists and  representatives of prestigious firms sense that when we conduct  business with one of them, we will never betray them, nor will  we break their contracts. Very serious people in the world  approach us. We are 29th on the list of countries where one can  invest safely. Many nations, whose names I refuse to mention,  are below us. I believe the media has already made this list  public; it will probably make it public again. I am sure the  media will comment on it, because it is a very important  achievement. We are close to the United States, and we are the  most promising country to import [sentence as heard]. This  confirms our people's willingness to fight and excel. [end  recording]     "
0,FT932-6577 ,"FT932-6577 _AN-DE0B8AG8FT 930527   FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (8): Diplomatic talks go on - The Falkland Islands      By JOHN BARHAM   ARGENTINA is obsessed with the Falkland Islands. Eleven years after its defeat in the 74-day conflict with Britain, the country's overriding foreign policy aim is winning sovereignty over the islands. In every important speech, President Carlos Menem makes a ritual reference to Argentina's sovereignty over the Falklands. He claims his policy of rapprochement - rather than confrontation - with Britain will enable Argentina to 'recover' sovereignty over the islands by 2000. Mr Menem said: 'We will continue talking. In the world of diplomacy one needs great patience. There is no possibility of taking this conflict over the Falklands to a situation similar to 1982.' His aim is to draw the UK into as close a relationship as possible. Stronger trade and investment links with Argentina would gradually reduce the importance of the Falklands to Britain. Eventually, London will have sufficient confidence in Argentina to consider transferring sovereignty. Several British companies already operate privatised utilities in Argentina. But instead of receding, the Falklands question remains an open sore in bilateral relations. Argentina continually presses for greater involvement in developing the natural resources. In 1991 the UK agreed to co-operate to conserve fisheries. Last year Argentina began to issue fishing licences, muscling in on the main source of revenue. Ordinary Argentines are frustrated that Mr Menem's policy has still not led to any talks over the crucial issue of sovereignty. London has remained unyielding in its insistence that co-operation with Argentina does not imply any recognition of its claim to the islands. The UK foreign office says this policy will change only if and when the islands' fewer than 2,000 inhabitants agree to a change in their status. Last month, Argentina suffered another diplomatic slap in the face when Britain announced it would extend territorial waters to 200 miles around the remote and uninhabited South Georgia and South Sandwich island groups, which Argentina also claims. Oil is emerging as another source of friction. The Falklands are believed to have big oil and gas deposits and Argentina wants to tie Britain into a joint oil regime. London has ignored Argentina's arguments, and last year licensed two companies to carry out seismic exploration in two blocks around the islands. Britain refuses to discuss oil co-operation until studies confirm the region does have hydrocarbon reserves in commercial quantities. There is scant chance of a shift in the islanders' virulently anti-Argentine attitudes. Memories of Argentina's three-month military occupation remain fresh. And Britain has still not lifted its arms embargo on Argentina. London has also successfully persuaded Washington not to sell two squadrons of ageing Skyhawk fighter bombers to Argentina. However, talks are planned later this year to resume training courses for Argentine officers at British military academies.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

In the 1990s, the nation's demand for energy will confront environmental  worries in the wake of the Valdez incident, drilling bans, clean-air laws and  concerns about global warming, the so-called greenhouse effect.    Oil prices that fell in 1986 to about $9 should hold at the current $19 or $20  a barrel at least through the early part of the decade. Such prices would help  the recovery of an industry still reeling from a decade of restructuring,  downsizing and streamlining.    The 1990s could see a modest resurgence of alternative sources of energy --  perhaps even a smaller, safer nuclear industry. But most analysts expect  continued reliance on oil.    New technology should lead to more efficient energy use and improve production  from existing U.S. wells. Currently off-limits areas such as the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge and coastal areas could eventually be opened to  exploration.    But few analysts expect U.S. oil production to turn up again, and the U.S. oil  industry will become more international, with most exploration and production  taking place overseas -- especially in Pacific Rim areas.    The big question will be when oil companies can expect the already overdue  collapse of the so-called natural gas bubble, or oversupply. New clean-air  regulations should increase demand for cleaner-burning gas, which is also used  to make methanol and other alternative fuels. That would lead to higher prices  -- and that would be good news for U.S. companies with sizable reserves.    Because U.S. oil and gas production fell in the 1980s, imports increased, and  that has set the stage for a re-emergence of the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries as a world force -- if it can keep quotas in line.    In any case, national oil companies of countries such as Kuwait, Venezuela and  Saudi Arabia will dominate the worldwide industry, analysts say. Those  companies will continue moving into the refining and marketing end of the  business in the United States and elsewhere.    As the 1980s showed, developments in the oil business can come swiftly and  unexpectedly, and analysts are not ruling out price shocks or shortages later  in the decade.

0,FT924-9893 ,"FT924-9893 _AN-CKCCTAF1FT 921103   FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (1): The worst has passed - World oil production is more closely aligned to demand than for many years. But there are fears of renewed instability once the UN decides to end its embargo on exports by Iraq      By NEIL BUCKLEY   THE WORLD'S oil and gas companies have been living through difficult times in 1992, but there are signs the outlook may be improving. More than ever before, the global oil and gas industry is dominated by questions of balance, and a delicate balance is now returning to some key areas. Oil prices drive the whole industry, and these have generally been firmer and more stable, thanks to a very tight balance between supply and demand, although there was a worrying Dollars 1-a-barrel retreat last week. One of the principal factors that could upset the balance this year is not the actions of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or Middle East politics, but something more mundane: the weather. A colder-than-average winter in the northern hemisphere for the first time in five years could add up to 75 cents to the price of a barrel of oil. That price is already expected to rise close to Dollars 22 a barrel for North Sea Brent crude this winter, and to Dollars 20.50 or more for the Opec basket of world crudes  - close to the target of Dollars 21 a barrel Opec adopted in July 1990. However, with Opec production now within 1m barrels a day of its estimated total capacity, analysts say any short-term disruption in supply  - for example, from the former Soviet Union  - could still produce a price spike of up to Dollars 25 a barrel. That fact illustrates the continuing dominance of Opec over the world's oil markets, but the post-Gulf war era has seen signs of change within Opec. Many believe the organisation is becoming more market-oriented, responding to the changed outlook which sees demand for Opec oil rising in the 1990s, unlike the 1980s when its market shrank. Most members, including Saudi Arabia, are in debt and keen to maximise revenues, and yet they are carefully being nudged by Saudi Arabia into extracting the highest price the market will support, while still ensuring there is enough oil to meet market demand. There is, however, one black cloud on the horizon that threatens to shatter the delicate balance within Opec and the world oil market: the possible lifting of the United Nations ban on oil exports by Iraq. Opec may find itself in 1993 having to absorb 2.5m b/d or more of Iraqi oil, something bound to provoke disagreement. While oil prices are still crucial to oil companies, they must pay increasing attention to gas prices, as gas consumption grows across the world. Here, too there is better news. Balance is returning to the US gas market, and the 'gas bubble' which has severely depressed prices is finally thought to be over. Prices dropped from about Dollars 2.50 per thousand cubic feet in the early 1980s to Dollars 1.63 in 1986, and bottomed out at a mere 90 cents in February this year. They then climbed to a peak of Dollars 2.60 in September  - buoyed a little by the drop in production caused by Hurricane Andrew. They have since settled back to about Dollars 2.40, but supply and demand are seen as being closely matched for the foreseeable future. The only threat is that if prices climb too high, some users might switch to burning fuel oil. The higher prices are especially good news for the exploration and production companies without downstream interest who specialise in finding, producing and selling oil or gas. Natural gas stocks were the best performers on the New York Stock Exchange for the six months to September, according to a recent report by First Boston. Meanwhile, in the UK, the devaluation of sterling in mid-December has helped push the sterling oil price above Pounds 12, compared with an average of little more than Pounds 10.50 for the first half of the year. Expectations of a continued strengthening of the dollar are prompting analysts to reassess their 1993 earnings forecasts for UK independent oil companies, and some of these have seen their share price rise 30 per cent or more since mid-September. The outlook for the major integrated companies, whose activities encompass not only exploration and production but refining and marketing and petrochemicals operations, is less bright. Slower economic growth in the Far East, hesitant economic recovery in the US, and continued weak economic activity and recession in parts of Europe are likely to keep refining and chemicals margins under severe pressure. Such pressures have forced the majors into aggressive cost-cutting, but here, too, they face a question of balance. They must weigh the need to cut costs against the growing necessity of replacing their reserves  - something they have consistently failed to do in recent years. As many of the traditional producing areas such as the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico reach maturity, and no longer hold out the prospect of giant field discoveries, the quest for reserves is taking oilmen into uncharted and often risky territories, from Laos to Colombia. The oil companies' drive for international expansion has conveniently coincided with the opening up of many traditionally closed areas of the world, and many analysts expect there to be virtually no countries where international oil companies cannot operate by the end of the decade. The republics of the former Soviet Union, with the world's sixth-largest known reserves of oil and largest reserves of gas, are proving a magnet for oil companies. But, nearly a year after the break-up of the Union, progress is still sluggish. While a number of new joint ventures have been formed with Russia, the biggest deals have been done with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and the smaller republics seem to be proving more fleet-of-foot than the lumbering Russian bear when it comes to attracting Big Oil. Oil companies must also balance the need for spending on exploration with the investment required to meet ever stricter environmental legislation. The threat of a carbon tax has, for now, receded. But Mr David Simon, chief executive of BP, told September's World Energy Congress in Madrid the estimated cost to oil companies of meeting environmental legislation in the US was between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 20bn, and in Europe Dollars 9.5bn  - equivalent to the net annual income worldwide of Europe's top seven oil companies. Environmental concerns may also alter the global balance between oil and gas consumption. The US energy Bill that finally cleared Congress last month encouraged the use of natural gas as a fuel for motor vehicles and power generation, and gave tax relief to gas drillers. Gas advocates say the US could cut its reliance on foreign oil, its trade deficit, and its emissions to the atmosphere, by switching to a gas-based economy from oil. On the other side of the Atlantic, the decision last month to close 31 of the UK's remaining 50 coal mines (a decision now being reviewed) was blamed on the 'dash for gas' by the privatised electricity generators. The ensuing row has reopened the whole debate about the UK's energy policy. An important plank of that policy has been privatisation, but there have been numerous difficulties stemming from the fact that British Gas, the former monopoly supplier, was sold in 1986 as a single entity. Attempts to speed up the development of competition have had limited success. A series of rows between British Gas and its regulators, the Office of Fair Trading and the Office of Gas Supply, culminated in the decision in August to refer the whole UK gas market to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a wide-ranging investigation. The result could be fundamental changes in the gas industry. The US began deregulation of its gas market in 1984, but the process is still continuing. What is intended to be the final phase, the Federal Energy Regulation Committee's Order 636, is due to be implemented next year. The Order will finally spell the end of the dominant merchant role of the interstate pipelines, allowing hundreds of suppliers to compete to provide reliable long-term gas services without having to own long-distance pipelines. But analysts predict its implementation could be dogged by uncertainty and controversy. European countries are unimpressed with the sometimes clumsy attempts by the UK and US to develop a competitive gas market, and powerful monopolies in many countries will resist any attempts to make similar changes. While the UK said it would use its presidency of the European Community to push for a single energy market, this has been overtaken by a fundamental debate about the future of the Community.

During the late 1950s to the early 1970s there was growth and diversification. The post-colonial era, however, saw an increased state involvement which caused a decline in efficiency and profitability. The 1990s, however, have brought hope of progress. Although statistics are hard to come by, the anecdotal evidence of greater interest in Africa by international resource groups is overwhelming. Most of the work is exploration, but further investment is bound to follow. One reason for the upsurge in interest is that other mining areas are fully exploited. Also, an effective environmental lobby means much of the developed world is becoming increasingly hostile to mining companies. Africa, by contrast, still tolerates some environmental degradation. Favourable policy reforms, however, have also contributed to a healthier investment climate. In Zambia, for example, the government's commitment to market economics and privatisation brought an upsurge in foreign interest. Prospecting licences, mostly for copper and gold, have been issued to Phelps Dodge of the US and South African mining houses including Anglo American, JCI and Anglovaal. In Ghana, liberalised mining investment laws have attracted Dollars 900m of new capital and helped to quadruple the country's gold production to 1m ounces a year since 1986. The government has plans to double production to 2m ounces a year by 1997. Much of the expansion will come from the rich Ashanti mine, but gold deposits in western Ghana have also attracted investors. And in Zimbabwe, Mr Derek Bain of the Chamber of Mines says exploration 'is the greatest it has ever been'. Most hope lies in platinum where BHP, Delta Gold, Anglo, RTZ and Union Carbide all have interests. Mr Alan McKerron, head of Anglo's New mining business division, says the example of Ghana is spreading to other countries. Further bolstering economic liberalisation is the 'conditionality' of multilateral financial bodies. Mr Bernard van Rooyen, executive director of Gold Fields, comments: 'Politicians are increasingly willing, but there is also a degree of compulsion because the only funds are from the World Bank and IFC and you won't get funds if you don't toe the market line.' Mr John Fernyhough, head of South African Sales at SG Warburg in London, argues that there is considerable pent-up interest in Africa among North American mining houses. Given political stability, Mr Fernyhough argues, these companies will pile into Africa. In its 1989 report, sub-Saharan Africa: From Crisis to Sustainable Growth, the World Bank concluded: 'Mineral production could (and should) become an important source of growth in many African countries. But this potential will not be fully realised unless a mutually beneficial partnership is established between government and investors.' That partnership may now be taking shape.

0,FT931-8844 ,"FT931-8844 _AN-DBQC0AEPFT 930217   FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG 'unprepared' for mining boom      By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent   IF RECENT events such as the dispute over ownership of the giant Porgera gold mine caused international investors to turn their backs on Papua New Guinea for a while, it might be a blessing in disguise, Mr Noel Levi, PNG's high commissioner in London, said yesterday. He pointed out that PNG became independent only 17 years ago and in the past few years had attracted well over Dollars 2bn of foreign investment in mining and oil projects while exploration expenditure by foreign companies was running at an annual Dollars 100m. The country had been 'thrown into the mining boom with no preparation' and might benefit from some breathing space. 'Perhaps we need time to reflect on the past decade and to put in place mining laws that are more up-to-date. Perhaps the present laws are not entirely to our benefit.' Mr Levi made it clear, however, that he, personally, wanted the USDollars 760m Lihir island gold project, which aims to develop one of the world's biggest and lowest-cost deposits of the precious metal, to go ahead as quickly as possible. Start-up of this project, in which RTZ, the world's biggest mining company has an 80 per cent stake, had already been delayed from 1992-93 to 1995, he said. 'But if RTZ wants it to happen, it will happen.' Mr Levi also pointed out his government's official policy was to welcome foreign investment 'because the international business community offers technical expertise and financial resources needed to develop our natural resources responsibly to build national prosperity.' At a meeting with institutional investors organised by Prudential-Bache Securities, the financial services organisation, Mr Levi was closely questioned about the Porgera mine. PNG has a 10 per cent stake in Porgera but both the new prime minister, Mr Paias Wingti, and the mining minister, Mr Masket Iangalio, have indicated this should be raised to 30 per cent, suggestions that created a bitter dispute with the Australian partners in the venture: Placer Pacific; Renison Goldfields; and a subsidiary of MIM Holdings. It was suggested by Mr Iangalio on Monday that the dispute would be settled by the end of this week but Mr Levi pointed out that so far the PNG cabinet had not been asked to approve any move to raise the Porgera stake or to allocate money to pay for it.  -----------------------------------       LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ----------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  -----------------------------------   Aluminium  +9,150 to 1,648,450   Copper       +550 to   319,425   Lead         -125 to   235,075   Nickel       +684 to    80,988   Zinc       +1,775 to   539,000   Tin          +190 to    17,120  -----------------------------------   Countries:-  PGZ  Papua and New Guinea, Oceania.

0,FT944-14045 ,"FT944-14045 _AN-EJYD1AEGFT 941025   FT  25 OCT 94 / Chemicals lift Exxon and other US oil groups      By RICHARD WATERS      NEW YORK   A cyclical rebound in earnings from their chemicals businesses helped Exxon and other big US oil groups to report solid gains in underlying operating profits for the third quarter. The overall earnings picture was complicated by one-off factors in both the latest and 1993 periods, however. As a result, net income at both Exxon and Amoco fell, while Arco reported a strong rebound in profits. The US oil majors' latest results come against the backdrop of a rise in oil prices from a year ago. This has lifted upstream exploration and production earnings, despite a fall in natural gas prices. Meanwhile, profit margins in downstream refining and marketing operations were well below the levels hit in the buoyant 1993 quarter, when the groups benefited from a sliding oil price. The improvements in chemical earnings at the three companies in the three months to the end of September showed that the industry's cyclical recovery remained on track. Overall, the US petrochemicals industry has experienced volume growth of 7 per cent over the past year, said Mr Paul Raman, a chemicals analyst at SG Warburg in New York. European growth in the latest period, at some 3 per cent, continued the recovery which had lifted earnings during the second quarter. Higher US prices in the petrochemical products in which the energy groups specialise - principally ethylene, polyethylene, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride - were supported by a fire at an Exxon plant in Texas during the summer. By limiting capacity, this helped to underpin price rises in the industry. Despite this, Exxon said its chemicals businesses earned Dollars 198m (Pounds 125m) in the latest period, up from Dollars 46m a year before (which was struck after a one-off tax charge of Dollars 26m.) 'Chemical product sales were the highest in over two years, and margins also improved,' said Mr Lee Raymond, chairman. Mr Laurance Fuller, Amoco's chairman and chief executive, also pointed to 'higher sales volumes and margins for most (chemicals) products.' The company reported earnings in this sector of Dollars 154m, compared with Dollars 60m in the 1993 period. Analysts expect the bounce in petrochemical earnings to continue in coming quarters. 'We're about halfway through the cycle,' Mr Raman said. Exxon reported net income of Dollars 1.15bn, down from Dollars 1.36bn after Dollars 306m of one-off benefits a year ago. Earnings per share were 92 cents, some 10 cents ahead of expectations. Amoco's net income of Dollars 445m after a Dollars 32m charge for environmental clean-up compared with Dollars 520m a year before, when it benefited from a Dollars 70m gain from asset disposals. It earned 89 cents a share, which was also ahead of market forecasts. Arco's after-tax profits were Dollars 435m, up from Dollars 68m, while earnings per share were Dollars 2.67.

0,FT924-7015 ,"FT924-7015 _AN-CKRCBAFKFT 921118   FT  18 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): General Motors slips as Dow holds ground      By PATRICK HARVERSON      NEW YORK   Wall Street AFTER Monday's sell-off, US share prices continued to weaken across the board yesterday, especially among secondary stocks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12.42 at 3,193.32. The more broadly based Standard  Poor's 500 closed 1.41 lower at 419.27, while the Amex composite eased 2.54 to 384.29. The Nasdaq composite index, again faring worst as investors took profits gained in recent weeks, lost another 6.94 to 627.07. Turnover on the NYSE was 187m shares. There was little economic news of substance yesterday, and attention was fixed on the monthly meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. Recent economic reports have shown that the recovery has gathered pace since the summer, and yesterday analysts did not expect the policy-making FOMC to sanction another cut in interest rates. General Motors slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 30 1/2 in turnover of 1.6m shares on a newspaper report claiming that the company knew about the vulnerability of its pick-up trucks to fires resulting from fuel tank ruptures in 1983, but that it did not take action to rectify the problem until five years later. GM already faces more than 100 lawsuits related to the fuel tank design, and the market fears that the number will rise. Arkla jumped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 9 5/8 in heavy trading after the company entered into a pact to sell its exploration unit to Seagull Energy for Dollars 402m. Arkla also planned to sell some properties to repay debt, and was considering selling its Louisiana Intrastate Gas subsidiary. JWP fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 3 1/4 after the company said it anticipated making a third-quarter loss of Dollars 162m following restructuring and other non-recurring charges which total Dollars 135m. ADRs in British Airways dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 after the airline announced a 23 per cent decline in second-quarter pre- tax profit and a 6.8 per cent drop in passenger yields in the first six months of the year. On the Nasdaq market, Borland International slumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 24 3/4 in turnover of 4.1m shares after the securities house, Lehman Brothers, downgraded the technology stock from 'outperform' to 'underperform'. Other leading technology stocks also ran into heavy selling. Apple gave up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 55 1/4 , Microsoft fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 90 and Sun Microsystems dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 . Canada A late selloff sent Toronto share prices lower in active trading. On preliminary data, the TSE 300 index shed 17.92 points, or 0.55 per cent, to close at 3218.47, as declines led advances 345 to 209. Volume was 39,117,000 shares.

By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      TOKYO      Wataru Tanaka, a science fiction writer and self-described ""aerospace  exploration commentator,"" nearly became the first Japanese to venture into  space. He hatched an outrageous plan four years ago to bring home a surplus  American rocket and blast himself into orbit.    But Tanaka, 58, whose credits include a book titled ""The Taste of Lettuce Eaten  In Space,"" gave up his dream after running into a wall of red tape. He counted  26 laws and regulations administered by six government agencies that made his  extraterrestrial mission all but impossible.    Tanaka's countrymen are not far behind, though. After decades of quiet, modest  research and development that attracted scant notice from abroad, Japan's  official -- and unofficial -- space programs are now reaching critical mass.  The effort could open yet another field where Japanese technological prowess  translates into an economic challenge.    Already, Japan has become the third country, after the United States and the  Soviet Union, to take aim at the moon.    On Jan. 24, a small scientific research institute run on a shoestring budget by  the Education Ministry launched ""Muses-A,"" a lunar orbiter that, if successful,  next month will become the first object from Earth to approach the moon since  the Soviets sent up an unmanned probe in 1976.    And in a peculiar drama that gives a new meaning to the ""space race,"" Japanese  government astronauts and private cosmonauts are competing to see who will be  the first to take a Rising Sun flag to the heavens.    Japan's primary space agency, the National Space Development Agency or NASDA,  is training two men and a woman to serve as payload specialists on the U.S.  space shuttle Atlantis in a flight scheduled for June, 1991.    At the same time, a commercial television network, Tokyo Broadcasting System,  has paid a hefty sum, reportedly $10 million, to Moscow for the privilege of  sending one of its journalists aboard the Soviet space station Mir in a mission  that could come as early as the end of this year.    NASDA, meanwhile, is joining the European and Canadian space agencies in  cooperative development of the U.S. space station Freedom. Japan is building a  $2-billion laboratory module for the space station, which is expected to start  orbiting the Earth in 1998.    On the immediate horizon, the Japanese are focusing their efforts on commercial  satellite launchings and other practical applications, such as last Wednesday's  launch of a marine observation satellite by NASDA.    But they also have long-range plans to send astronauts aloft in their own space  shuttle. The government's Space Activities Commission proposed last June that  Japan try launching its own space station by the year 2010. One of the  country's major construction companies is designing a ""space hotel,"" while  another envisions a lunar resort offering ""zero-gravity games"" to shuttle-loads  of Japanese tourists.    ""This is the destiny of the human race,"" said Akira Kubozono, executive  director of NASDA. ""We Japanese have decided we must pursue manned space  development. It's a dream, a romance. And if new technologies spin off in the  process, we can always benefit by spreading them through industry.""    This bold vision of space development and the commercialization of related  technologies may seem laughable given Japan's meager space budget. In the  current fiscal year, Japan is spending about $1.1 billion on space, or less  than a tenth of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's  $12.3-billion budget. NASDA has 950 employees, as opposed to about 22,000  working for NASA.    But as the Muses-A moon mission demonstrates, impressive results sometimes can  be achieved without astronomical spending. The scientific organization that  launched the lunar orbiter, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science  (ISAS), grew out of a low-key research laboratory at Tokyo University that  pioneered Japan's efforts to escape gravity in 1955 by launching 9-inch-long  ""pencil rockets.""    (A replica of the first Japanese pencil rocket is on display at the National  Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.)    ISAS, which now has a full-time staff of 105 and operates on a budget of about  $145 million a year, has launched 19 satellites since 1970 with essentially  home-grown technology. It made its first interplanetary voyage in 1985 and sent  two satellites to rendezvous with Halley's comet the following year. Muses-A is  designed to test the ""swing-by"" technique, by which the moon's gravitational  pull will be used to catapult a second, tiny satellite into lunar orbit  sometime around March 18.    ""After we finish with the moon in the 1990s, we may be ready to take on Mars,""  said Yasunori Matokawa, an ISAS official.    Tanaka, the writer and failed free-lance astronaut, predicts that it is only a  matter of time before space fantasies start becoming reality here. When a  Japanese finally flies in space, he said, the media hoopla can be expected to  spark a boom in public interest and mobilize vast resources.    ""Once Japanese see something with their own eyes, they can understand it,"" said  Tanaka, who also operates a space cafe in Tokyo called ""Restaurant Goddard,""  after the U.S. rocket scientist Robert H. Goddard, who pioneered liquid fuel  engines.    ""We're not good at imagining things we can't see, and at this point space  exploration is entirely abstract,"" Tanaka said. ""But when the time comes, you  can count on the Japanese to jump out in front.""    Indeed, early signs of space fever are already starting to appear. In April,  Nippon Steel Corp. plans to open ""Space World,"" a so-called ""edu-tainment""  theme park on the site of its shut-down plant in Yawata, in southwestern Japan.    Under the banner of diversification, the world's largest steelmaker will also  run a space camp at the park, modeled after and licensed by the original one in  Huntsville, Ala.    Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. is marketing ""space food"" through the health food  section of a major department store chain, and Uni-Charm Corp., a leading maker  of sanitary napkins and disposable diapers, is now designing products for space  travel. Both these companies, along with Sony and Minolta, have lined up as  commercial sponsors for the Tokyo Broadcasting System's six-day ride aboard the  Mir space station.    Toshio Nakanishi, a network spokesman, said the extravaganza was initially  planned as a stunt to celebrate the commercial broadcaster's 40th anniversary  next year, but it quickly took on a deeper meaning.    ""We thought it was necessary now for a Japanese to go to space,"" Nakanishi  said. ""So far, a total of about 200 people from 20 countries have been in  space, but not a single Japanese. We're way behind, compared to the economic  power we possess.""    The network plans to broadcast daily 10-minute live television spots from  orbit.    Author Tanaka is disturbed by the thought that a television journalist aboard a  Soviet craft may be first Japanese in space, before one of NASDA's  professionals rides on a friendly American space shuttle. (The original plan to  have a Japanese payload specialist fly on the U.S. space shuttle two years ago  was delayed by the Jan. 27, 1986, Challenger explosion.)    ""It's going to be a problem from a historic point of view if the first Japanese  in space rides with the Soviets,"" he said. ""This is a highly symbolic matter.  The United States is our closest ally. We owe our postwar economic prosperity  to America. I don't know where this idea comes from that you can buy whatever  you want with money. We Japanese didn't used to think like this.""    NASDA's Kubozono was somewhat more philosophical about the network's deal with  the Soviets.    ""There's a lot of room in space,"" Kubozono said. ""They're making considerable  noise about who's going to be first, but our aims are completely different.  We're in this for science, not publicity. We may have feelings about it in our  hearts, but we don't need to say anything out loud.""    Adding to the confusion over who might actually be blazing the trail for  Japanese space exploration is the subtle bureaucratic rivalry between NASDA,  part of the Science and Technology Agency, and ISAS, part of the Education  Ministry.    NASDA is the younger of the two agencies, created in 1969 to pursue practical  applications in space, and it receives the lion's share of the space budget.  ISAS is ostensibly confined to scientific research -- Parliament even sets a  limit on the diameter of the rockets it may build and launch, which was only  recently expanded to 8 feet 3 inches.    Yet the division of labor is sometimes blurred. Both agencies are working on  separate projects to develop an unmanned space plane, for example. And the fact  that ISAS invented its own rocketry while NASDA imported technology from the  United States, in a crash catch-up program, appears to be a lingering sore  point for the latter agency. NASDA did not launch its first satellite until  1975, five years after ISAS.    Now, NASDA is exhibiting a stubborn pride -- and commercial interest -- in  sticking to purely Japanese technology in developing the next generation of the  H-II rocket, a two-stage, 108-foot-tall launch vehicle capable of carrying a  two-ton payload.    NASDA's earlier efforts were based on McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co.'s  Delta rocket, and although its current workhorse rocket, the costly H-I, is  about 80% Japanese, key components such as the first-stage engine rely on  imported technology. The compulsion to go it alone has resulted in some serious  problems and delays in the H-II development, however.    Twice last year, the H-II's first-stage engine, the LE-7, caught fire during  tests at NASDA's launch center on Tanega Shima, an island off Kagoshima in  southwestern Japan. The problem, related to regulating the flow of liquid  hydrogen into the combustion chamber, has already delayed completion of the  H-II by one year, to 1993.    Although the engine is similar to those used on U.S. space shuttles, Tomifumi  Godai, NASDA's chief of launch vehicle development, dismissed the idea of  turning to the Americans for help, saying Japanese engineers would be able to  solve the problem by themselves. Godai also insisted that the new rocket would  be a cost-effective launch vehicle, capable of carrying satellites aloft at  internationally competitive prices.    Keeping the H-II development limited to 100% domestic know-how is a crucial  challenge because a bilateral agreement with the United States currently gives  Washington veto power over the launching of third-country satellites when U.S.  technology is involved.    At stake is the potentially lucrative market for commercial satellite  launching, which Arianespace, the European consortium, now dominates. But even  if NASDA overcomes its H-II engine troubles, other barriers to competitiveness  remain, not the least of which is an agreement with local fishermen limiting  launch schedules to two 45-day windows, one in summer and one in winter. Noise  from the rockets supposedly scares away the tuna.    Still, Americans who recall dismissing those first imported fleets of homely  Japanese cars in the 1960s might think twice before laughing away Japanese  ambitions in space. Japan went on to out-finesse the U.S. auto industry, it may  be recalled, after starting very small.    And a familiar name is on the cutting edge of Japan's space technology:  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., the company that built the Zero fighter 50  years ago and more recently lobbied unsuccessfully to go it alone designing  Japan's next generation jet fighter, the FSX.    A co-development agreement to license technology from the U.S. front-line  fighter, the F-16, to Mitsubishi Heavy for the FSX was nearly scuttled in a  last-minute attack by critics in Washington last year. Opponents argued that  the deal handed over key technology that Japan could later use to compete  against the United States in the aerospace and commercial airliner industry.    A residue of mutual suspicion left by the FSX dispute, coupled with unresolved  U.S. frustrations over a contentious trade complaint about American commercial  satellites sales to Japanese government agencies, perhaps colors the atmosphere  in cooperative space development.    According to news reports, Kubozono expressed irritation over delays in the  Freedom space station program when he visited Washington recently. In general,  the Japanese appear to be growing wary of relying on the United States and its  vastly superior experience in space.    ""You can't depend on another country. If you don't have advanced technology of  your own, it's impossible to truly participate in international cooperation,""  said Matokawa of ISAS. ""From now on, I suppose we'll go on relying on NASA; at  the same time we'll have to develop our own independent capabilities.""

We Japanese didn't used to think like this.""    NASDA's Kubozono was somewhat more philosophical about the network's deal with  the Soviets.    ""There's a lot of room in space,"" Kubozono said. ""They're making considerable  noise about who's going to be first, but our aims are completely different.  We're in this for science, not publicity. We may have feelings about it in our  hearts, but we don't need to say anything out loud.""    Adding to the confusion over who might actually be blazing the trail for  Japanese space exploration is the subtle bureaucratic rivalry between NASDA,  part of the Science and Technology Agency, and ISAS, part of the Education  Ministry.    NASDA is the younger of the two agencies, created in 1969 to pursue practical  applications in space, and it receives the lion's share of the space budget.  ISAS is ostensibly confined to scientific research -- Parliament even sets a  limit on the diameter of the rockets it may build and launch, which was only  recently expanded to 8 feet 3 inches.    Yet the division of labor is sometimes blurred. Both agencies are working on  separate projects to develop an unmanned space plane, for example. And the fact  that ISAS invented its own rocketry while NASDA imported technology from the  United States, in a crash catch-up program, appears to be a lingering sore  point for the latter agency. NASDA did not launch its first satellite until  1975, five years after ISAS.    Now, NASDA is exhibiting a stubborn pride -- and commercial interest -- in  sticking to purely Japanese technology in developing the next generation of the  H-II rocket, a two-stage, 108-foot-tall launch vehicle capable of carrying a  two-ton payload.    NASDA's earlier efforts were based on McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co.'s  Delta rocket, and although its current workhorse rocket, the costly H-I, is  about 80% Japanese, key components such as the first-stage engine rely on  imported technology. The compulsion to go it alone has resulted in some serious  problems and delays in the H-II development, however.    Twice last year, the H-II's first-stage engine, the LE-7, caught fire during  tests at NASDA's launch center on Tanega Shima, an island off Kagoshima in  southwestern Japan. The problem, related to regulating the flow of liquid  hydrogen into the combustion chamber, has already delayed completion of the  H-II by one year, to 1993.    Although the engine is similar to those used on U.S. space shuttles, Tomifumi  Godai, NASDA's chief of launch vehicle development, dismissed the idea of  turning to the Americans for help, saying Japanese engineers would be able to  solve the problem by themselves. Godai also insisted that the new rocket would  be a cost-effective launch vehicle, capable of carrying satellites aloft at  internationally competitive prices.    Keeping the H-II development limited to 100% domestic know-how is a crucial  challenge because a bilateral agreement with the United States currently gives  Washington veto power over the launching of third-country satellites when U.S.  technology is involved.    At stake is the potentially lucrative market for commercial satellite  launching, which Arianespace, the European consortium, now dominates. But even  if NASDA overcomes its H-II engine troubles, other barriers to competitiveness  remain, not the least of which is an agreement with local fishermen limiting  launch schedules to two 45-day windows, one in summer and one in winter. Noise  from the rockets supposedly scares away the tuna.    Still, Americans who recall dismissing those first imported fleets of homely  Japanese cars in the 1960s might think twice before laughing away Japanese  ambitions in space. Japan went on to out-finesse the U.S. auto industry, it may  be recalled, after starting very small.    And a familiar name is on the cutting edge of Japan's space technology:  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., the company that built the Zero fighter 50  years ago and more recently lobbied unsuccessfully to go it alone designing  Japan's next generation jet fighter, the FSX.    A co-development agreement to license technology from the U.S. front-line  fighter, the F-16, to Mitsubishi Heavy for the FSX was nearly scuttled in a  last-minute attack by critics in Washington last year. Opponents argued that  the deal handed over key technology that Japan could later use to compete  against the United States in the aerospace and commercial airliner industry.    A residue of mutual suspicion left by the FSX dispute, coupled with unresolved  U.S. frustrations over a contentious trade complaint about American commercial  satellites sales to Japanese government agencies, perhaps colors the atmosphere  in cooperative space development.    According to news reports, Kubozono expressed irritation over delays in the  Freedom space station program when he visited Washington recently. In general,  the Japanese appear to be growing wary of relying on the United States and its  vastly superior experience in space.    ""You can't depend on another country. If you don't have advanced technology of  your own, it's impossible to truly participate in international cooperation,""  said Matokawa of ISAS. ""From now on, I suppose we'll go on relying on NASA; at  the same time we'll have to develop our own independent capabilities.""

The North American Free Trade Agreement would gradually eliminate almost all trade and investment restrictions between the US, Canada and Mexico over 15 years. Side agreements, concluded in August, require the enforcement of environmental and some labour laws, under penalty of fines or sanctions. The US and Canada entered a free trade agreement in 1989, and the pact would thus mainly affect trade and investment with Mexico. Nafta is intended to come into effect on January 1, although a delay is allowed for. The Canadian Parliament has already approved the agreement. The US House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on it today and the US Senate some time after. The Mexican Senate, dominated by the country's governing party, will vote on Nafta after the vote in the US House of Representatives. GENERAL PROVISIONS Tariffs reduced over 15 years, depending on sector. Investment restrictions lifted in most sectors, with exception of oil in Mexico, culture in Canada, and airline and radio communications in the US. Immigration excluded, except some movement of white collar workers to be eased. Any country can leave the treaty with six months' notice. Treaty allows for the inclusion of any additional country. Government procurement opened up over 10 years, mainly affecting Mexico, which reserves some contracts for Mexican companies. Dispute resolution panels of independent arbitrators to resolve disagreements arising out of treaty. Some snap-back tariffs if surge of imports hurts a domestic industry. INDUSTRIES Agriculture: Most tariffs between US and Mexico removed immediately. Tariffs on 6 per cent of products - corn, sugar, and some fruits and vegetables - fully eliminated only after 15 years. For Canada, existing agreement with the US applies. Cars:Tariffs removed over 10 years; Mexico's quotas on imports lifted over the same period; cars eventually to meet 62.5 per cent local content rule to be free of tariffs. Energy: Mexican ban on private sector exploration continues, but procurement by state oil company opened up to US and Canada. Financial Services: Mexico gradually opens financial sector to US and Canadian investment, eliminating barriers by 2007. Textiles: Treaty eliminates Mexican, US and Canadian tariffs over 10 years. Clothes eligible for tariff breaks to be sewn with fabric woven in North America. Trucking: North American trucks could drive anywhere in the three countries by the year 2000. SIDE AGREEMENTS Environment: The three countries liable to fines, and Mexico and the US sanctions, if a panel finds repeated pattern of not enforcing environment laws. Labour. Countries liable for penalties for non-enforcement of child, minimum wage and health and safety laws.

0,FT944-15918 ,"FT944-15918 _AN-EJPAHAEMFT 941015   FT  15 OCT 94 / Travel: So very Kiwi - clean and green - John Westbrooke revisits his homeland      By JOHN WESTBROOKE   The skies over New Zealand are broad, blue and bitingly clear. It has something to do with lack of pollution, and with sea breezes - and, alas, with the ozone layer. It seems very unfair. Fridges and aerosol cans spew out CFCs north of the equator, but the southern hemisphere bears the brunt: a fluctuating hole over Antarctica and a distinct thinning over New Zealand, Australia and Chile. You can still tan, but with care and high-factor sun cream. It is particularly unfair because New Zealand is one of the greenest of countries, and Kiwis the greenest of people. They are devoted to the environment, and they have a lot of it - imagine a land the size of Britain filled with a population of only 3.5m. New Zealand outdoorsmen invented jogging, jet-boating and bungee jumping (and, they claim on fairly persuasive grounds, aeroplanes). Rugby remains the big spectator sport, but most people's pastimes are wide-open-spaces stuff: yachting, running, tramping (the local term for hiking). We went tramping for a few hours along the Marlborough Sounds at the top of the South Island, New Zealand's sunniest region. A fast boat, with dolphins surfing in its wake, took us from Picton to Resolution Bay and the road-free home of John Teutscher, our guide. He generates his own power and grows his own food, and what he cannot provide himself comes on the same boats as we did: meals-on-keels, they call themselves. His wife, he said, was the expert on trees; his speciality was birds. So it proved, as he charmed fantails and bellbirds out of the bushes with what sounded like faultless imitations of their calls. The sun filtered down between branches high above, and through green gaps we caught glimpses of blue water and blue hills along Queen Charlotte Sound. As we reached the halfway ridge, the trees around us were not all natives: early farmers had cleared the land, planted imports and then given up, and it was reverting to such overgrowth as black beeches with honeydew sap - which draw wasps by the dozen. Over the ridge was real evergreen New Zealand bush: silver ferns, nikau palms and big rimu trees, 140ft high and 800 years old. (For the even bigger and older kauri, you have to go to the far north of the country.) At sea level we reached Ship Cove, named by Captain Cook who visited it five times on his three voyages in the 1770s; and we relaxed on the beach, recovered our breath and waited for the boat to pick us up. The isolation is real, and I sympathised with the farm children we met around the sounds, studying by correspondence and going fishing by way of entertainment. Some families bring in paying guests for 'homestays', typically involving transport by boat or float-plane, excellent home cooking, a warm spa pool under the stars. Here you can wake up, watch the morning mist rising over the water, and know you will need binoculars to see the neighbours. We stayed with the Perrets in Bay of Many Coves, lunched with the Robbs in Kenepuru Sound, and visited the Brakenridges' sheep station on Pohuenui Island, all of them miles from one another and delighted to offer hospitality to strangers. From the farm's highest point, we looked around 360 degrees, at more islets and inlets than we could count, alternating fingers of blue and green stretching into the distance. There are only a couple of towns in the area: Picton, the ferry port through which most people drive without noticing, and Havelock, on the next sound. Havelock is little more than a village but two noted scientists began their schooling there: William Pickering, who worked on the US space programme, and Ernest Rutherford, who split the atom - an irony in a country so passionately anti-nuclear. New Zealanders' utopian ideals are encouraged by their remoteness from their neighbours: a 1,500-mile circle round Picton will contain no one else but penguins and Australians. Most native animals are unique, including birds such as the kiwi which have forgotten how to fly as they have nowhere to go. Politicians are free to experiment: the country pioneered the welfare state and votes for women, and is now struggling with an extreme market economy. And the people are as New Age as any Californian. One women's magazine features not only the usual agony aunt, astrological and medical pages but columns by a vet, a palmist, a clairvoyant and a feng shui geomancer, a product of growing immigration from south-east Asia, who answers such psycho-domestic problems as 'My son has painted his room purple and it's giving off bad vibes. . .' One of the elements keeping the country in touch with the world is the wine industry, big and growing. On the plains to the south of the Marlborough Sounds, the sun has proved perfect for ripening grapes. Though not hot enough for reliable reds, the long, bright summers have produced world-beating whites in only a decade. The best known brand is Cloudy Bay but there are 21 vineyards in the region. Most call themselves boutique wineries, and some have restaurants on site where you can sit in the sun, eat, drink and count your blessings. The best known variety is Sauvignon Blanc, but if you feel that drinking it is like being pelted with ripe fruit, there are plenty of elegant Chardonnays and Rieslings as well. The region is rich in food, too: crayfish, apricots, olive oil, strawberries, merino meat and more. It exports pumpkin seeds to America and wasabe - a very hot Japanese mustard - to Japan. There are salmon farms along the sounds, and 350 green-shell mussel farms. Down the east coast is the town of Kaikoura, which was once a centre for the early whalers. Now you can go whale-watching with an operation run by local Maoris who take you offshore to look for seals, dolphins and young, male sperm whales. They sail year-round and claim a 95 per cent success rate, but the best time is early in the morning before the winds spring up. When the boat draws alongside a 50-ton whale lifting its tail in the air before quietly diving, the sight is breath-taking. Very green, very New Zealand. John Westbrooke was a guest of Air New Zealand and the New Zealand Tourism Board. Return fares to Auckland start at around Pounds 900, cheaper at bucket shops. The people are friendly, the roads empty, and motels ubiquitous; but the sun can be fierce: summer is December to March. The Mobil Travel Guides to the country (published by Reed, sometimes available in Britain) are among the world's most exhaustive. The NZ Bed and Board Book (Moonshine Press, New Zealand) is a good guide to homestays.   Countries:-  NZZ  New Zealand.   Industries:-  P7999 Amusement and Recreation, NEC.

0,FT934-9100 ,"FT934-9100 _AN-DKLCNABGFT 931112   FT  12 NOV 93 / UN tightens Lockerbie sanctions on Libya      ByMICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS AT THE UN and MARK NICHOLSON      NEW YORK, CAIRO   THE UN Security Council last night voted to tighten sanctions against Libya in a new effort to bring the two men accused of the Lockerbie airliner bombing to trial in Scotland or the US. The measures include freezing Libyan financial assets abroad, strengthening an existing ban on international air links by closing all foreign offices of the Libyan airline, and halting exports to Libya of oil refining and pipeline equipment. In addition, funds derived from Libya's oil and natural gas sales and from agricultural products must be paid into separate and exclusive bank accounts. Eleven member nations of the Security Council voted for the resolution. There were no votes against it but China, Pakistan, Morocco and Djibouti abstained. Libya so far has refused to hand over the two men accused of blowing up the Pan American airliner which disintegrated over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives. The latest measures will not go into effect until December 1, giving Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, extra time to try to negotiate a solution. The new sanctions are likely to have a psychological rather than an immediate economic impact on Libya, particularly as they leave untouched its hydrocarbon export revenues, which amounted to Dollars 9.5bn last year - some 95 per cent of hard currency earnings. Closure of the state airline offices merely tightens an existing ban on air travel, an inconvenience Libyans have got used to since April 1992. Most of Libya's imports arrive by sea or road. The ban on parts and spares for the country's oil transport and export facilities is designed to erode its export capacity. There were hints last month that Libya might surrender the accused men for trial in Scotland but this came to nothing, ostensibly because their lawyers objected. An offer to hold the proceedings in Switzerland, which Mr Ali Ahmed Elhouderi, the Libyan delegate, repeated at the UN yesterday, has been rejected by Britain. The Libyan delegate insisted that only the venue was in dispute, not the question of holding a trial. The resolution was carefully drafted to cause as little interference as possible with western Europe's economic relations with Libya or with exploration contracts signed recently by Total of France, Eni-Agip of Italy and Petrofina of Belgium. In a bid to protect its own economic interests, including Libya's Dollars 4bn debt-for-arms purchases, Russia at first threatened to block the resolution. President Boris Yeltsin relented in response to personal appeals by President Bill Clinton and Mr John Major, the British prime minister. Russia voted for the resolution, which at its insistence included an affirmation of 'Libya's duty scrupulously to adhere to all of its obligations concerning servicing and repayment of its foreign debt'. Delaying imposition of the new measures until next month was also a Russian proposal.   Countries:-  LYZ  Libya, Africa.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT941-7801 ,"FT941-7801 _AN-EBWDCADQFT 940223   FT  23 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Greening the Gatt   The environment is set to become a big issue in global trade policy. But the question confronting members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is how precisely to deal with it. The solution that seems likely to be chosen at the April ministerial meeting in Marrakesh, convened to confirm the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, is establishment of an exploratory committee on trade and the environment with loose terms of reference. That must be the sensible way to proceed. The 118 nations that took part in the Uruguay Round agreed last December that a comprehensive work programme on trade and the environment should be put to the ministers. Since then they have come to realise that there is no agreement on a committee's precise mandate or lifespan. Environmentalists are understandably unhappy with this, since they fear that such a committee will dodge the issues. Equally understandably, developing countries fear that green attitudes mask a rabid new form of protectionism. Since the international trading regime can only be based on consensus, an agreement to explore issues must be the starting point. What makes this not just essential, but right, are the difficulties of the issues. Environmentalists want, for example, the right to discriminate between identical products, on the basis of how they are produced. They also want the power to impose anti-dumping duties on goods whose production involves low environmental standards. Both these demands, questionable enough in themselves, could evidently turn into excuses for increased protection. Rank hypocrisy is another risk. People in the north complain, for example, about the way developing countries are cutting down their rain forests, so exacerbating global warming. But they tend to forget that the 15 per cent of the world's population in rich countries generates 60 per cent of the gases responsible for global warming. While consistency between trade law and multilateral environmental agreements must be secured, anything beyond that should be approached with caution and humility. The starting point is an open-minded exploration of such questions as the proper diversity in environmental standards, possible remedies for international environmental spillovers and the degree to which product prices reflect their full environmental costs. Any new committee could not do better than start from the principles outlined last December at the end of the Uruguay Round. Among them was the statement that 'there should not be, nor need be, any policy contradiction between upholding and safeguarding an open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system on the one hand, and acting for the protection of the environment . . . , on the other'. This reconciliation is achievable but its negotiation will, like the Uruguay Round, require years rather than months.   Countries:-  XAZ  World.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT931-15893 ,"FT931-15893 _AN-DAJAPAE3FT 930109   FT  09 JAN 93 / Books: Front line socialists      By ZARA STEINER   LOST COMRADES: SOCIALISTS OF THEFRONT GENERATION by Dan S. White Harvard Pounds 27.95, 255 pages DAN WHITE has found an original and exciting theme and has written a compelling exploration of it. He has taken a group of men, Hendrik de Mann in Belgium, Oswald Mosley in Britain, Marcel Deat in France, and Carlo Meirendorff and Theodor Haubach in Germany, and used their intellectual-political biographies to create a composite portrait of a generation of socialists, all of whom served at the front in the Great War. All emerged determined to reject the rule of 'old men' in favour of a new form of socialist politics. De Mann, the most intellectually interesting of the group, and Deat became fascist sympathisers and collaborationists after 1940. Mosley was imprisoned for his fascist activities. The two Germans ended as martyrs in the anti-Nazi resistance. White has done a masterly job in weaving together their disparate yet connected stories, highlighting their common generational experiences without minimising the importance of the national settings which determined their eventual fates. These are all studies in failure. None of these men left any mark on the post-1945 socialist movements. In each case, the experience of the trenches shaped the thinking of these 'front line socialists'. The men of the left became pacifists and political activists after 1918, re-thinking the socialist doctrines of their early youth in terms of a tragedy which none wanted to see repeated. The ex-combatants looked for something more vibrant and exciting than the theories of the past. They sought to create new movements that would go beyond working-class ideologies, Marxism and existing parliamentary forms. All strongly believed in national planning but sought a new economic order that would embrace Europe. They were committed to action, to the cult of leadership, and to the use of propaganda that would energise the passive majority. To the lessons of the trenches was added the new challenge of the fascists with their successful mobilisation of the masses. Yet none of these ex-soldiers succeeded in overcoming the inertia of the socialist parties to which they belonged. Nor could they match the popular appeal of national socialism. Having failed to prevent war in 1939, the more disillusioned chose the path of collaboration hoping that Hitler's New Order might provide a final chance. The more resilient or, perhaps, the truly idealist, joined the Resistance. Even as he traces the wartime careers of de Mann and Deat, White continues to stress the utopian elements in their thought, under-playing, in my view, the moral weaknesses in their arguments which military defeat exposed but did not create. Neither man found himself welcomed either by the German officials or the Occupation governments. Disillusionment came quickly. White has used the generational concept to excellent effect. If the author has treated his subjects too sympathetically, he has provided good reasons for re-examining their roles.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

He added in an  interview with AL-HAYAH that OPEC could restore Iraq's prewar  quota, which was distributed among other countries, without a  price collapse.    The Omani minister, whose country usually undertakes the  role  of coordinator between OPEC producers and other producers,  criticized countries in the petroleum exporting organization for  blaming the current petroleum price declines on nonmember  countries, describing this as unfair, especially given the  tendency of OPEC's production to rise, and the production of  nonmember countries to decline.    Al-Shanfari, who this week accepted the OPEC  secretary-general's invitation to intervene with countries  outside the organization to support petroleum prices, showed no  eagerness to reduce the production of his country, or that of  other producers outside the organization. He emphasized that  OPEC itself needed ""cohesion"" and that OPEC itself was capable  of fixing prices.    The Omani minister confirmed the increase in his country's  production this year, to record levels: 800,000 barrels.    The text of the interview follows:    ['Abd-al-Ghani] This month, in which Oman's national day  falls, and in the light of the drop in petroleum prices, it has  been noted that the Sultanate's production and reserves have  risen. What is the volume of the increase? How can it be  reconciled with Oman's pessimistic expectations in the early  1970's?    [Al-Shanfari] I am pleased to give you a complete picture of  our petroleum production, especially since 1974. It was in that  year that the picture of the future of petroleum and gas was  very bleak. At that time, Omani and international experts  expected that Oman would have petroleum in the years to  come--the years we are now living in.    At the time, we had a petroleum reserve of about 1.5 billion  barrels; our daily production was less than 300,000 barrels.  Today, praise God, and with the guidance and support of His  Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id in the petroleum sector, we have  achieved these excellent results. Our production is now 800,000  barrels per day [bpd], of which 80,000 bpd are for local  consumption. We export the rest (720,000 bpd).    Oman's petroleum reserves have more than tripled, nearing 5  billion barrels. We hope soon to add half a billion more barrels  to the reserve, and I may say that the outlook is now bright. We  are still at the beginning of the road, and I believe that we  have great petroleum possibilities.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] More than one OPEC official has said that  the  petroleum market is now experiencing a new price war, and that  the non-OPEC member countries of the region--among them  Oman--are responsible for this deterioration. Do you agree with  this assessment? Or is it your view that the failure of OPEC  states themselves to adhere to the quotas is behind the rise in  supply, and by extension the price collapse?    [Al-Shanfari] There is much to be said about this, but I do  not want to get into blaming anyone in particular. The fact is  that the global economy is in an unstable state. When  development is slow in this economy, it is difficult to expect  the consumption of large quantities of petroleum. Consumption  grows slowly in the Western world--i.e., the industrialized  countries--at a rate of less than 1 percent. Comparing that with  the countries of Asia, we find that there is a large increase in  consumption, and a greater absorptive capacity; average  petroleum consumption rises 10 percent per year, reaching 14  percent in the case of China.    Thus there are many factors involved in the collapse of  petroleum prices, which taken all together do not encourage the  growth of demand for petroleum. It is also true that some  countries boosted their production capacity, such as the North  Sea countries, Norway and Britain, but honestly, I cannot lay  blame on the countries outside OPEC, because the majority are  countries with small production (with the exception of Russia  and the North Sea countries) that do not affect the global  petroleum markets. Going back to the production of producing  countries outside OPEC will fortify this view; we find that  their petroleum production is decreasing. In 1989, their  production was 43 million bpd, and this year it dropped to about  40 million bpd.    In 1988, the OPEC countries' production was 21.8 million  bpd,  and it rose this year to about 26.9 million bpd.    So--there is a reduction in the petroleum production of the  non-OPEC states, and an increase in the petroleum production of  the organization's member states. Thus it would be wrong and  unfair for us to blame the drop in prices on the non-OPEC states.    Here in Oman, as a coordinating state between the OPEC  member  producers and non-OPEC producers, we do not want to lay blame on  specific parties, and we hope that our brothers in OPEC will not  lay blame on the non-OPEC countries. I can give an example in  this context that some members in the exporting organization  directly boosted their production higher than it had been before  the last Gulf war by nearly 40 or 50 percent. Some countries  that had a daily production of 1.5 million barrels before the  crisis have increased it to nearly two million bpd or more.    Another thing. All indications are that many non-OPEC  producers are decreasing production. China, for example, will  this year become an importing country, and India, too, will  bcome an petroleum importer within months or a year at the most.    Among some OPEC member states there is a lack of agreement  or  consensus, but if there were to be cooperation and some good  will among us, then the price situation would improve. Time is  on OPEC's side; this is what I think and understand from my  experience with petroleum-producing countries inside and outside  the organization. I also say that we must not lay blame on one  another. Let us coordinate with one another, because our dispute  is not in the best interests of producing countries. I want  there to be cooperation and mutual understanding among all  producers.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] There are calls to hold a meeting of OPEC  states and nonmember countries to reach an agreement to support  prices based on the OPEC member states' request for a 5 percent  or more drop in production, as has happened before. Would you  agree, at this time, when we are seeing a retreat in petroleum  prices and revenues, to another drop in your production, or will  you price as you did before to convince Russia and other  producers to lower their production?    [Al-Shanfari] We have no problem going along with these  calls, on condition prices are raised. But we believe that  lowering production without prices being raised would be hard  for a country like Russia, which is facing economic hardship, or  China, whose exports do not exceed 100,000 bpd. That leaves  Oman, Mexico, or Egypt. Is it possible to ask Egypt, which has  enormous economic challenges, or us in Oman, whose petroleum  revenues are insufficient to achieve the government's ambitions,  especially as we want to follow in the footsteps of our brothers  in the Gulf, who produce large quantities of petroleum.    We in Oman need petroleum revenues for the basic necessities  of development. How can our brothers, who produce millions of  barrels, ask Oman to reduce its production by 20,000 or 30,000  barrels?    Even so, we have no objection, and are constantly declaring  our readiness to cooperate. But how can we ask a country like  Egypt, in its circumstances, with a population growth of nearly  a million people every year?    This is why we hope the members of OPEC will do their utmost  to cooperate among themselves. If that happens, they might be  able to solve the current petroleum price problem.    Everyone knows that Norway is not prepared to lower its  production. While they might cooperate with us, it is only  verbally. They are always attending the coordination meetings  that OPEC members and nonmembers hold, just to listen to our  points of view. Britain is the same, except that it does not  consent to attend our meetings, because they have their own  circumsatcnes and policy. I reiterate, in spite of that, our  willingness to cooperate, as non-OPEC producers, but it is up to  OPEC to define or fix prices, so there must be greater cohesion  within the organization. Our belief is that even if we did lower  our production, it would not be much of a help to the current  price situation. All the power lies within the organization.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Would you agree with the view that the  chance  of Iraq returning to the petroleum market is one of the major  reasons for the current drop in global petroleum prices?    [Al-Shanfari] Everyone knows that Iraq is a  petroleum-producing country, and Iraq's quota of OPEC production  before the war is known. Iraq's return to the ""petroleum  producers' and exporters' club"" is something to be taken into  consideration. We in the Sultanate of Oman hope that Iraq will  go back to producing its petroleum. The Iraqi people have  suffered enough. Iraq's quota is known to all, just as Kuwait's  was. Kuwait came back and resumed producing its quota, even  increased it. The Emirates' quota was known, and its current  production is known. Iraq should resume producing, and Iraq's  resumption of production will not mean chaos or disorder in the  global petroleum market. I believe the OPEC countries will allow  Iraq to resume its quota. As to when Iraq will return and what  effect that will have, these matters are hard to predict fully  right now, though our hope is that sanctions will be lifted from  Iraq and it will be able to resume exporting petroleum.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] But what will happen to the market and  prices  in the event OPEC is preventing from granting Iraq its old quota  as soon as the international sanctions are lifted?    [Al-Shanfari] The question of the price collapse might  happen, I believe, if OPEC does not consent to give Iraq its  former quota. Prices would plunge, possibly reaching $10 per  barrel. This would hurt producers. If Iraq is given the quota  that was taken from it, or distributed among some other  countries, I don't think we'll see a collapse of petroleum  prices.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Recently there has been a noticeable  slowdown  in the giant joint ventures Oman had contracted for, for  instance, the construction of an petroleum pipeline from the  Caspian Sea to the Black Sea, or the gas pipeline to India, as  well as the liquid gas project--whose estimated total price tag  is nearly $18 or $19 billion.    [Al-Shanfari] Discussing these projects brings us to the  Sultanate's efforts to diversify its revenue sources at the  local level, into the areas of agriculture, industry, fisheries,  and minerals. We have also begun to diversify these sources  abroad; we have begun to seek out economic projects abroad. We  have actually signed agrements with Russia and Kazakhstan to  build a Black Sea pipeline through Russia. The project is now  ready for implementation. An economic study is now being  prepared, along with the route of the pipeline. We hope that the  study will be adequate, and we will receive it soon. Naturally  we have entered the stage of obtaining of the petroleum  exploration concession in Kazakhstan, and we hope that work will  get under way soon in developing this concession. We have signed  an agreement with the Indian Government to supply the Indian  subcontinent with natural gas from Oman. As the world's second  most populous country, after China, India likewise has a rising  demand for energy, and the same holds true for the other rapidly  developing countries of Asia, such as Vietnam, Taiwan, and  others. The agreement includes the building of a pipeline, and a  study is now being prepared. We hope it will be completed for us  to consider by March/April 1994. The study will definitively  establish the route of the pipeline and its actual cost. We are  negotiating with the Indian Government over the pricing of the  gas, and are working on having the project implemented at the  earliest possible opportunity. We have the strong support of His  Majesty the Sultan in building this pipeline, which will be the  first of its kind in the world--it will be built at a depth of  3,000 meters under the sea.    Economically, it will be a first-class pipeline. It will  allow the planning of other pipelines between the Indian  subcontinent and the Arabian peninsula. We in Oman welcome the  participation and cooperation of our brothers in the region,  should they have the intention. We could work on petroleum  pipelines, because as we have begun with gas we can take on the  building of other pipelines for petroleum.    According to what I have understood from Petroleum Ministry  experts, the main obstacle to this project is technical, in  terms of the means of putting a pipeline 3,000 feet down, but  even this obstacle can be overcome. When the studies are  completed, there will be an international tender for the  construction of the pipeline. There is another project, the  liquified gas complex we are also interested in, which may cost  as much as to $9 billion.    People may wonder how these huge, expensive projects are  funded. So far we have knocked on the doors of international  financiers, because we are still in the study stage, but what I  would like to make clear is that building these projects will  not affect the development process at home. No portion of our  current global investments will be withdrawn; these projects  will be funded through international institutions. I do not  believe Oman will have any difficulty in handling this funding,  because these projects are vital and profitable, and the  Sultanate's economic reputation abroad is excellent, because of  our political stability. Contacts have been made in this regard.  We in the Petroleum Ministry, as well as our brothers in the  Omani Finance Ministry, have received proposals from  international banks and investors, all of whom want to take part  in these projects.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] After your recent visits to China and India,  you announced Omani investments in those two countries'  petroleum industries. What is the nature and scale of the  investments? Will they be in the field of exploration and  extraction, or in petroleum refining?    [Al-Shanfari] On my visit to India, we noticed vast  possibilities in all aspects of work and investment in China. We  are now discussing projects such as obtaining Chinese petroleum  concession regions, building petroleum refineries, and  participating in pipeline construction. We are still at the  negotiation and discussion stage, so right now it is difficult  to say what will be agreed upon. I think we willl be able to get  certain project agreements within about four months.    Turning to foreign investments, we have a project to build  two petroleum refineries in India, and we have also taken a  share in an petroleum refinery in Thailand with Caltex, Inc. We  are thus trying to diversify our income sources, especially  since most of these projects will produce revenues in 10 or 15  years, and at that point will constitute another support for the  Omani economy, which will prevent our continued dependence  solely on petroleum revenues.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do you think that India's recent agreement  with Iran for a natural gas pipeline from Iran to India will  affect the Indian government's commitment to their agreement  with you?    [Al-Shanfari] So far, our agreement is in force, and we are  moving ahead with it. The Indian Government feels that we are  serious about implementing it, and I do not think the Indians  will change their minds. I met with Indian Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao, who asserted his support for the project. Just  last week there were talks with the Indians on the course of the  work. We are now at the stage of implementing what we agreed  upon. We are not speaking of an imaginary project. We hope that  two years from now the Indian subcontnent will have natural gas  from the Arabian peninsula.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Has the Sultanate's petrochemical project,  which will depend on more natural gas energy and discoveries in  the Sultanate, reached the stage of signing an agreement, or is  it still at the preliminary study stage?    [Al-Shanfari] The extent of the natural gas present under  the  Sultanate has begun to become clear. At present we have reached  gas reserves of 20 trillion cubic feet. We have an ambitious  exploration program, and I think there are great possibilities.  I believe continued exploration for gas will make the picture  even clearer. We are able--according to our own experts'  estimates--to double our present gas reserves. We use natural  gas in Oman to provide energy for electric stations. Another  large electrical station will soon be added, in Manah, in the  interior of Oman.    As to the petrochemical complex and other projects, we are  continue to study them, especially as our available gas reserves  are sufficient for the Sultanate's local consumption for more  than 30 years, in addition to covering the liquid gas project's  needs and those of the natural gas pipeline to India.    We believe that within a few months we will add new  quantities of gas. This gas is associated with petroleum  (petroleum liquids) that will be added to our petroleum reserves.      "

The mining industry is a basic industry in China's national  economy, including undertakings in coal, the chemical industry,  nonferrous metals, construction materials, the metallurgical  industry, and geology and mineral resources. China has abundant  natural resources and can be considered a major producer of  mineral resources. At present, the number of minerals that have  been surveyed as being abundant is 151. China ranks third in  the world both in terms of the potential value of its mineral  resources and as a producer of mineral ores. In recent years,  it has considerably raised the output of raw and semifinished  materials which depend on mineral products for their raw  materials. China's output of coal ores, cement, and glass has  been the largest in the world, and its output of steel and  nonferrous metals, crude oil, and gold has been, respectively,  the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-largest in the world. Economists  made the following comment on the issue: The development of the  mining industry has enormously increased China's comprehensive  national strength and has laid a material foundation for  realizing the second-step strategic objective.    While deepening reform and gearing up toward the market,  China's mining industry has been actively seeking international  markets. It has been learned that cooperation in marine oil  exploration, which is generally concerned with international  joint ventures, has continually expanded. The China National  Offshore Oil Corporation has signed agreements with 50 companies  from 13 countries and regions to open up 560,000 square km of  the ocean's area, and foreign companies have accumulatively  invested $3.68 billion of funds. China has made various types  of progress in joint ventures to develop mineral resources with  Brazil, Mongolia, and South Africa. China has jointly launched  more than 30 geological exploration undertakings and surveying  projects for mineral resources with 17 countries and regions.  More than 20 Chinese mineral surveying teams have entered the  international market, and these have contracts for more than 100  projects. China's new nuclear power and nuclear fuel industry  has also begun to enter the international market. A Pakistani  nuclear power project, which was the first nuclear power plant  exported by China, is progressing smoothly.    According to the leaders of relevant departments and  commissions and mining industry representatives attending the  meeting, even though China has made attention-catching  accomplishments in developing its mining industry, it is still  facing an arduous situation with many problems and restraining  factors obstructing its path of progress. Therefore, they  proposed: It is necessary to deepen reform in the mining  industry's structure, particularly to enhance reform in  enterprise and investment, mining rights, and social security  systems.

This will reduce transportation cost to a level  similar to airplanes, and will make many new projects, such as  lunar exploration and solar power generation satellites,  possible. This was the first time a concrete program, including  cost estimates, of reusable space systems has been made public  in Japan. As the enormous cost of massive space development  programs in the 21st century is becoming a problem, NASDA's  estimate will certainly animate the debate on this issue.    This estimate is contained in a NASDA report: ""A Study on  the  Repercussion Effect of Space Infrastructure.""    The report recommends replacing the present transportation  system using disposable rockets with a ""new space  infrastructure"" based on the concept of repeated use. It  proposes a ""space shuttle system"" going back and forth between  the earth and outer space like airliners.    Under this scheme, ""orbit operations spacecraft"" responsible  for maintenance work of satellites, ""fuel stations,"" and  ""inter-orbit transport spacecraft"" moving between different  orbits will be launched in space. All these spacecraft are to  be reusable.    According to the estimate, a shuttle spacecraft (development  and operation cost estimated at $25 billion) and six inter-orbit  transport spacecraft (development and operation cost $7.6  billion) will be developed in 10 years from 1995, and these will  be in service for 20 to 30 years.    As a result, while accumulated cost for the reusable space  system, including development cost, will be overwhelmingly  higher than the original disposable system at the beginning, by  the year 2020, or the 15th year after going into service, cost  for the two types will be almost the same, after which the  reusable system will be more cost-efficient.    Compared to the annual operating cost of $7.5 billion for  the  current disposable system, cost for the reusable system will be  around $2 billion, or about 25 percent. With further efforts to  improve efficiency, it will be possible to reduce cost to 10  percent.    With the new ""space infrastructure,"" it will be possible,  for  instance, to extend the endurance of artificial satellites  dramatically by replacing batteries or refuelling. Furthermore,  since repairs will be possible on the orbit, the extremely high  level of reliability required at present will not be necessary.  This will make lower development and manufacturing cost possible.    The study foresees a project of transporting several hundred  tons of helium 3, a nuclear fusion fuel which is abundantly  available on the lunar surface, to the earth. While the  transportation cost under the old disposable system makes up as  much as one-fourth of the entire world space budget (around $70  billion), under the reusable system, cost will be merely  one-tenth. Therefore, the project ""is possible even without  obtaining new appropriations.""     "

0,FT943-9745 ,"FT943-9745 _AN-EHIE8AE7FT 940809   FT  09 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kennecott under attack over diamond sampling      By BERNARD SIMON      TORONTO   Canadian geologists and mining analysts have strongly criticised Kennecott, the US subsidiary of UK mining group RTZ, in the wake of disastrous sampling results from one of the most prominent properties in the Northwest Territories diamond rush. The results have burst the bubble of euphoria which has enveloped the search for diamonds across a wide swathe of northern Canada during the past two years. Share prices of companies involved in the stampede have crashed since Kennecott announced last Friday that results from the highly-touted Tli Kwi Cho kimberlite pipe were far below expectations. Some of Kennecott's junior partners have lost more than 80 per cent of their market value. For example, Kettle River Resources plunged to CDollars 1.99 early yesterday from CDollars 11.75 just before Friday's announcement. Mr John Idt, analyst at Dominick and Dominick Securities in Toronto, said yesterday the Tli Kwi Cho project was dead. 'Somebody might go back and look, but it will take a few years,' Mr Idt said. Kennecott owns 40 per cent of the DHK joint venture, which was rushing to prove that Tli Kwi Cho could rival the nearby Lac de Gras area, where a consortium comprising Australia's BHP Minerals and Dia-Met Minerals of Canada is expected to give the go-ahead later this year for North America's first diamond mine. 'In hindsight, Kennecott advanced the project too fast,' said Mr Chris Jennings, president of SouthernEra Re-sources, which has a 10 per cent interest in Tli Kwi Cho. 'The mentality of catching up to BHP and Dia-Met cost them a lot of money, and at least a year,' said Mr Jennings. Tli Kwi Cho is about 40km south-east of the BHP project. Criticism centres on Kennecott's decision to go ahead with costly underground tests on the basis of samples which weighed less than 2 tonnes and were retrieved from about 50 narrow-diameter drill holes. Kennecott has spent an estimated CDollars 15m (USDollars 10.9m) on the underground programme which involved bulk samples of 5,000 tonnes. Mr Jennings said that Kennecott had 'assumed an air of secrecy' towards other joint-venture participants. He alleged that the US company refused to allow its junior partners to visit its sampling plant at Yellowknife. He also said that Kennecott failed to carry out a promise to advise them well in advance if results failed to live up to expectations. Two principal kimberlite bodies were analysed from the Tli Kwi Cho pipe. The higher-grade body was especially disappointing, with fewer than 30 per cent of those diamonds more than 2mm in diameter classified as gem quality. Kennecott concluded that the results were not sufficiently encouraging to justify further bulk sampling from Tli Kwi Cho. Mr Jennings, who has wide experience in diamond exploration, said there was an 'outside chance' that the samples were not representative of the whole pipe. The joint venture is, however, now pinning its hopes for diamond exploration on other nearby pipes.   Companies:-  Kennecott Corp.   Countries:-  CAZ  Canada.

Since its founding, the Beijing Copyright Protection  Association has focused on publicizing and popularizing the  Copyright Law. In March 1993, the association organized  training on the ""Universal Copyright Convention and copyright  management"" for people in charge of copyright-related work from  more than 60 publishing houses and press offices in Beijing,  thus enabling them to gain a preliminary knowledge and  understanding of the Universal Copyright Convention, and thus  laying a fairly sound foundation for copyright management organs  to exercise their duties in accordance with the law. The  Beijing Copyright Protection Association also has organized many  forums regarding the Copyright Law for artists and renowned  writers in Beijing, and it has launched publicity and  consultation services regarding the Copyright Law in Beijing's  main streets and public places. This has facilitated Beijing's  enforcement of the Copyright Law.    The Beijing Copyright Protection Association has provided  services for copyright protection and has carried out  explorations and experiments in copyright agency services. Last  September, the Beijing Copyright Protection Association and the  Beijing Copyright Bureau held the first trade fair on book  manuscripts, thus serving as a bridge between writers and  publishers. Nine publishing agreements and 30 letters of intent  on publishing were concluded, and approximately 300,000 yuan  worth of business was conducted. The fair won universal acclaim  from writers and publishers. The Beijing Copyright Protection  Association also has actively investigated piracy and other  infringements on behalf of copyright holders. In 1993, the  association sent its members to Heilongjiang Province, Hebei  Province, Tianjin municipality, and Shanxi Province to  investigate the piracy of ""The Gourd Brothers,"" a book published  by the China Film Press. It helped the publishers recoup part  of their economic losses.    The Beijing Copyright Protection Association also has made  active efforts to mediate copyright disputes. A publishing  house in Beijing had a dispute with the heir of an author, and  the dispute remained unresolved for several years. Last year,  the Beijing Copyright Protection Association mediated the  dispute at the request of both parties and quickly solved it.  According to the feedback of many publishers and writers in  Beijing municipality, the civilian mediation process employed by  the Beijing Copyright Protection Association regarding copyright  disputes is simple, is unlikely to provoke hard feelings, and is  economically acceptable.    After more than a year of exploration and practice, the  Beijing Copyright Protection Association has inducted most of  the publishers and a number of writers in the Beijing area,  thereby initially installing a collective management mechanism  for copyright management in the Beijing area.

The China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) says its overseas  operations are advancing as scheduled.    In the meantime, it says, conditions are suitable for  opening  new areas for petroleum exploration and development.    In an interview with Business Weekly, Zhang Yongyi, CNPC's  vice-president, cited the example of old oil wells in Peru that  have been upgraded by Chinese technicians and are now producing  more oil.    CNPC signed a contract with Petrol Peru last year for  further  development of a 182-square-kilometre block in an old oilfield.  Production at the oilfield, which was discovered in 1874, has  declined after more than 100 years of exploitation.    CNPC, which produces some 140 million tons of crude oil a  year, has mature technology and enough equipment for enhancing  oil recovery, Zhang said.    In a couple of North and Latin American nations, CNPC is  conducting seismic work, Zhang revealed.    In Thailand, CNPC has made progress in developing oil.  Another CNPC official said Chinese are doing preparatory work  for constructing an oilfield.    In Papua New Guinea, CNPC will explore for oil in one block  code- named 160 and another named Kamusi. CNPC is teaming up  with companies from Japan and Hong Kong in the exploration.    After leading a business group to the Central Asian nations  of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan last  month, Zhang said new fields for cooperation will be opened  there. Zhang was travelling with a Chinese Government  delegation headed by Premier Li Peng.    Zhang believes prospects for Chinese co-operation with the  four republics are good since the needs of all five countries  are complementary.    Two letters of intent for closer ties were signed by CNPC  and  the petroleum sectors of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.    More co-operation is expected in the exploration,  development  and trade of crude oil and natural gas.    According to the letters of intent, technical exchanges and  visits to oilfields will be more frequent than before.    CNPC and Turkmenistan reaffirmed their desires to work  together, along with the Japanese industrial conglomerate  Mitsubishi, to develop natural gas.    Construction of a pipeline is being considered to carry  natural gas from Turkmenistan to Japan by way of China. Gas  resources in Turkmenistan are estimated at 20,000 billion cubic  metres.    Zhang cited several advantages for CNPC in improving  petroleum cooperation with Central Asia:    -- Proximity, which ensures convenience in co-operative  exploration, development and trade;    -- Chinese technology, engineering and experience, which  suit  the needs of the four nations;    -- Similar economic and social conditions, which enhance  mutual understanding as the five countries make the transition  from rigid central planning to market economies.

0,FT944-14760 ,"FT944-14760 _AN-EJUCOADDFT 941021   FT  21 OCT 94 / Arts: Delusions of dance - Clement Crisp reviews Momix      By CLEMENT CRISP   Momix is the name of a cattle-food. It is also the name given by Moses Pendleton to the group of five gymnasts he directs, who are offered to the world as dancers. The word 'choreography' is used in the programme to describe their little numbers. The words 'dance', 'illusion', 'satire' are found in their publicity. I would venture that the satire lies in their illusion that they dance. I saw Momix on Wednesday night at Sadler's Wells as a ten day season got under way. I did not see all the programme, finding it impossible to remain for the latter part of Passion, their chief offering, since by then Momix' activities had induced symptoms I associate with having eaten a spoiled oyster. So my comments relate to about two-thirds of the evening. It may be that, thereafter, blazing theatrical genius fired the event. It may also be that the members of Momix (2m; 3f) are Equerries and Ladies in Waiting to the Queen of Peru. The programme offers gymnastic exploits and a few skimpy costumes - stretch fabric - in brief scenas of unfathomable purpose. One man exercises on a table; three girls do a Page Three with balloons; someone is involved with a rope, which gives the audience a chance to giggle. Bodies assume shapes curious but far from intriguing. The accompaniment is rock blare. One number, Alan Boeding's Circle Walker is memorably revived from a previous visit. Boeding has made a handsome structure which is a metal circle whose lower half is set at right angles to its upper part and joined by curved struts. There results a sculptural and free-wheeling object inside which Terry Pexton moves and poses. It is an imaginatively fascinating concept. Pexton becomes an heroic figure, part Icarus as he stands high on the circle's edge, part Sisyphus as he pushes it, both master and prisoner of the wheel, and we see fascinating possibilities for dance and for choreographic exploration of willed and involuntary momentum. It is grown-up activity, a phrase I cannot use about the rest of the evening. The show is, I'd hazard, ideal for those in their early 'teens. There is relentless pop music, played before the performance and in the interval - and also in the Wells' cafeteria. The performers have fine physiques, and there is a topless moment to intrigue the younger lads. Passion, the main item of the evening, has music of vast banality by Peter Gabriel, and, for as long as I watched, was pointless - unless the sight of the cast bent in half and clutching their buttocks was a message about the terrors of haemorrhoids. Perhaps this was the satire we were promised by the advertisements. It certainly wasn't the dance. Momix is at Sadler's Wells until October 29.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT923-6141 ,"FT923-6141 _AN-CH0BVACUFT 920826   FT  26 AUG 92 / British Gas falls into Pounds 82m loss: Warm weather and growing competition blamed for disappointing second quarter      By NEIL BUCKLEY   BRITISH GAS yesterday blamed warm weather and growing competition in the gas market for a disappointing second-quarter fall to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 82m on a current cost basis. The loss compares with a Pounds 183m profit a year ago. The company warned this would reduce full-year profits unless the weather was significantly colder in the second half. The figures were in the mid-range of analysts' forecasts, but the shares fell 5 1/2 p to 237 1/2 p. First-half profits fell to Pounds 778m from Pounds 1.16bn last year. Mr Philip Rogerson, managing director of group finance, said the fall was 70 per cent due to exceptionally warm weather which depressed demand, and 30 per cent to increasing competition and the recession. In UK gas supply, operating profits fell Pounds 200m in the second quarter, reflecting a 12 per cent fall in sales volume. Purchase costs increased 4 per cent, while non-gas costs rose 4.5 per cent - which disappointed analysts looking for signs of cost savings. Mr Rogerson said independent shippers increased their share of the firm contract market to 30 per cent, and British Gas lost business in the interruptible market by customers switching to oil. Operating profits for exploration and production fell to Pounds 2m from Pounds 51m, due to decreased sales and production, and depressed sterling oil prices. However, profits from overseas gas supply rose from Pounds 19m to Pounds 23m. 'This is genuinely a very poor set of figures,' said Mr Steve Turner, analyst at Smith New Court. 'We underestimated the effects of the weather, but it is clear that margins are very badly squeezed and little progress has been made on cutting costs.' Mr Turner is downgrading his forecast for full-year net income to Pounds 1bn from Pounds 1.1bn. Earnings per share for the half-year were 11.7p, against 17.4p last time. Although a change of year-end makes direct comparisons difficult, a 6.4p half-year dividend, compared with a pro forma 6p a year ago, was apparently better news for the City. Based on a 45:55 split between interim and final dividends - which British Gas has hinted at - the pay-out would total 14.2p, compared with a pro forma 13.4p last year. However, while Mr Rogerson said British Gas had not changed its policy of increasing the dividend in real terms, analysts said he indicated the company was changing its thinking on dividend cover - which could imply a lower total payout.

0,FT932-17197 ,"FT932-17197 _AN-DDACLAIDFT 930401   FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (16): On stream, on time - There's nothing else like the Oso condensate field      By DAVID PILLING   THIRTY-FIVE kilometres off the coast of Nigeria, towards the border with Cameroon, waves lap a gleaming structure of pipes, walkways and funnels. To the uninitiated, the edifice - which resembles an aquatic Pompidou centre - might look like any other oil platform. But to those in the know, the Oso field is something special. First, Oso produces not oil, but condensate. Unlike oil, condensate exists in the ground as a gas. As it is forced to the surface, it cools and takes on the qualities of a light crude. Much of the platform's paraphernalia is needed to separate and stabilise the condensate and to re-inject associated gas. Second, Oso represents that rare thing in Nigeria - a mega-project, worth Dollars 900m, that has come on stream. According to Mobil's Mr Jim Massey, executive director for exploration and producing, Oso has successfully left the drawing board because it is 'simply a very good project, both for Nigeria and for Mobil. The drives were there for all sides to make it work.' Mobil discovered the Oso field, which contains 500m barrels of recoverable condensate, as long ago as 1967. But it was not until 1988, when Opec excluded condensate from its quota system, that exploitation became economically attractive. After several hiccups, the project - a 60:40 joint venture between state-owned NNPC and Mobil - won 65 per cent loan financing from the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and export credit agencies of Japan and the US. The remaining 35 per cent was provided in the form of equity by NNPC and Mobil. In June 1990, contracts were awarded to a consortium of McDermott of the US, Bouygues of France and Japan's JGC Corporation. Oso came on stream, on schedule and under budget, last December. The first 600,000 barrels of condensate were piped on to the Olympic Symphony tanker on Christmas Eve and delivered to Mobil's refinery in Beaumont, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico. Condensate, which trades for about the same price as North Sea crude, is refined into petroleum fuel, kerosine and naphtha feedstock for petrochemicals. After nearly four months, Oso was producing 50,000 barrels a day (b/d). On-site engineers were confident that, once 'teething problems' were ironed out, production would reach the planned 100,000 b/d by mid-April. Oso is expected to generate Dollars 12bn during its 20-year lifespan and should recoup its investment within two years. Looking to the future, Mobil has begun engineering work on Oso II, an Dollars 800m project to extract natural gas liquids (NGL) from Oso gas and gas gathered from nearby fields. The NGL would be separated into propane, butane and pentane-plus for export. Oso II has a tentative start-up date of late 1996. But Mobil has so far failed to discover other condensate fields. For the moment at least, Mr Massey says, 'we don't have anything else quite like Oso'.   Companies:-  Mobil Corp.     Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.   Countries:-  NGZ  Nigeria, Africa.

0,FT934-951 ,"FT934-951 _AN-DLVCCAB2FT 931222   FT  22 DEC 93 / Chief executive hails gamble that paid off      By ROBERT CORZINE   The consensus at the London headquarters of British Gas yesterday was that the gamble of placing the company's future in the hands of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the government had paid off. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive officer, said he 'felt totally vindicated in having sought a broader MMC review' than proposed by the government. He said the decisions by Mr Michael Heseltine not to break up the company and to remove the company's mainly residential monopoly by 1998 would 'move us forward towards longer-term regulatory stability and a balance of interests between consumers, shareholders and employees'. Fears of a competitive free-for-all in which British Gas would be left as a supplier of last resort to unprofitable customers were swept away by Mr Heseltine's insistence that all gas suppliers take on social obligations to groups such as the disabled and elderly. The seasonal display of goodwill at British Gas even extended to Ofgas, the industry regulator. British Gas's senior management had engaged in a war of words for much of the past 18 months with Mr James McKinnon, the previous Ofgas director. Relations with his successor, Ms Clare Spottiswoode, have clearly improved. Both sides said yesterday they would work closely to iron out details of British Gas's corporate restructuring and preparations for greater competition. Unresolved issues which will impinge heavily on British Gas's profitability include the question of whether the formula for the maximum price rise allowed should be relaxed. It is set at the retail prices index minus 5 percentage points, a level which British Gas says was appropriate for an integrated company with a secure monopoly, not one facing a big restructuring and early competition. Changes in British Gas's corporate culture clearly influenced the thinking of Ofgas and the government. Ms Spottiswoode said the rejection of the MMC's recommendation of divestment was due in large part to 'rapid changes' in the company's culture. In his statement Mr Heseltine welcomed the corporate restructuring announced last week. It will result in British Gas abandoning its traditional regional structure in favour of five business units. These will focus on: Gas transportation and storage. Public gas supply to mainly residential customers. Contract trading with large commercial users. Installation and servicing of gas central heating. Retailing. The recent appointment as chairman of Mr Richard Giordano, the highly regarded former chairman and chief executive of British Oxygen, also sent a signal to the government and the City that British Gas was moving quickly towards a more commercial culture. The speed and enthusiasm with which that culture permeates the company will be a big factor in preparing the company for future competition. It is likely to be complicated by the company's need for a cost-cutting programme. The DTI decision to opt for early competition puts additional pressure on British Gas to develop non-regulated businesses, including its worldwide oil and gas exploration and production division and Global Gas, which oversees international distribution and power-generation projects.

0,FT922-3962 ,"FT922-3962 _AN-CFIBTAAWFT 920609   FT  09 JUN 92 / Serbia suffers under sanctions      By JUDY DEMPSEY      BELGRADE   THE impact of United Nations sanctions imposed a week ago on Serbia and its tiny ally Montenegro will bite much sooner than expected, according to Serb economists and western diplomats. They say this is because the Serbian government did not build up adequate reserves of raw materials and spare parts, even though it saw how the war in neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina had severely disrupted the entire transportation system throughout the former Yugoslavia. The sanctions have forced the government of Montenegro to introduce petrol rationing which took effect from last Saturday. Serbia is expected to follow suit by issuing ration coupons this week. In Montenegro, private car owners are allowed 30 litres of petrol a month, transport vehicles 400 litres and tractors and taxis 250. In both republics, the price of petrol increased last week by between 80 and 100 per cent. A litre of petrol now costs 750 dinars or one US dollar at the official rate. Serbia's oil fields produce between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the country's total needs. The rest was imported from Romania, Greece, Iran, and the former Soviet Union. A Serb economist yesterday said Serbia might not be able to keep domestic production at present levels. 'We were in the process of concluding contracts for importing exploration equipment to maintain that production. The sanctions put paid to that,' he said. Serbia has abundant hydroelectric supplies. However, the sanctions mean that Serbia will not be able to import turbines from Croatia, one of its traditional suppliers. 'We do not have extra turbines. The sanctions show just how inter-dependent the Yugoslav republics were,' the economist said. He added that petrol shortages will exacerbate food price rises, because petrol rationing could reduce the volume of food supplies coming into Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Belgrade newspapers yesterday reported that the price of 7,200 goods were increased last week. In addition, the agricultural sector depends on imported chemicals and oil derivatives. Mr Andras Vince, a Hungarian economist in Belgrade, said Hungary supplied Serbia with the bulk of its chemical needs. The steel industry is likely to be hit hard by sanctions. Any steel shortages could soon affect the arms industry, and the military effectiveness of the Serbians. For instance, the steel works in Niksic, Montenegro, produces between 250,000 and 280,000 tons of steel a year, including high quality alloyed steel, most of which goes directly to the defence industry. Mr Samo Markovic, an official at the Yugoslav Iron and Steel Federation, said the plant had stockpiled only about 20 days of finished products. 'The steel mills are not self-sufficient,' said Mr Markovic. 'Serbia and the other republics had to import almost all their iron ore and coke from eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and Latin America,' he explained.

By WILLIAM BOOTH, THE WASHINGTON POST      The most dire predictions about global warming are being toned down by many  experts, who now predict that temperatures and sea levels in the next century  will not rise as dramatically as once feared.    While climate researchers tend to agree that our grandchildren will inherit a  warmer world, many scientists are now betting on an average warming of only  three or four degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, the low end  of a range that prognosticators once put as high as nine degrees.    A rise in sea level, one of the most feared consequences of global warming,  also is expected to be far less drastic than previously thought, largely  because of the surprising observation that the polar ice sheets are not  melting, but growing in size. According to Mark Meier of the Institute of  Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, the consensus now is  that sea level will rise by about a foot in the next century, rather than the  three feet that had been suggested in previous studies.    But even if the revised forecast is correct, there would be major effects, the  scientists warn. A one-foot rise in sea level would inundate some shorelines,  moving the water's edge inland by hundreds or thousands of feet. And a global  warming of only a few degrees might upset communities of plants and animals  that have developed over millennia.

Perry points to a recent study by the climate office of National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration that concluded that a slightly warmer, wetter world  would increase food production, enhance forest growth and enlarge water  supplies. An obvious drawback was that billions of dollars would have to be  spent protecting coastal areas from rising seas.    The great uncertainty in predicting global warming and its effects is making  life difficult for government policy-makers. The computer models upon which all  forecasts are based are generated by a small group of scientists who  acknowledge that they do not understand or even recognize all the variables  that affect their predictions, thus compounding policy uncertainties.    ""The things we can say with confidence, the policy-makers are not interested  in. And the things the policy-makers are interested in, we don't know with much  confidence,"" said Jerry Mahlman, director of NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics  Laboratory at Princeton University.    ""Modelers have been thrust into the limelight way too soon,"" said Richard  Cooper, an economist at Harvard University. ""They don't have models today you  can build public policy on.""    The frustration was evident at a meeting Cooper and Mahlman attended recently  at the National Academy of Sciences, where an expert panel was grappling with  the policy implications of global warming. After a long afternoon, during which  the invited scientists displayed graphs with past and future temperatures  bouncing up and down like rubber balls, they were finally begged to put aside  the carefully hedged forecasts and simply make a ""best guess."" While the ranges  of guesses varied, the favorite seemed to be a four-degree increase by the  middle of the next century, when concentrations of carbon dioxide gas -- which  contributes to the ""greenhouse effect"" -- are expected to double.    One reason many researchers are shying away from the worst-case scenarios so  popular a year ago has to do with the climate record itself. While researchers  argue that the oldest records are highly suspect, in general they agree that  temperatures have risen over the past 100 years by about a degree. But there  are tremendous arguments over whether or not this increase is due to an  accumulation of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which trap  heat close to Earth. Instead it may be the result of some other climatic cycle  unrelated to human activity. But whatever its cause, the temperature record is  more consistent with a rise of four degrees, rather than nine degrees, by the  middle of the next century.    ""The new runs do favor the lower estimate,"" said Warren Washington of the  National Center for Atmospheric Research, another top climate modeler.    Two of the most recent climate simulations, done by the National Center for  Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab  at Princeton, suggest slightly lower temperature increases, according to the  scientists who run them.    Both models showed uneven warming in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. In  one run, the region around the Southern Ocean that surrounds Antarctica did not  warm at all. The model showed it cooling, thanks to improved simulations of how  the ocean currents circulate and mix. Another world-class model, run by the  United Kingdom Meteorological Office, cuts temperature rises in half when the  researchers change the way raindrops are represented.    Of course, not all the climate modelers agree with the lower estimates. One is  James Hansen of National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard  Institute for Space Studies in New York. Hansen said he thinks his model and  the observed temperature record are still in keeping with a greater future  increase in temperatures. At the meeting at the National Academy of Sciences,  Hansen stated again that he thinks warming associated with increased greenhouse  gases has already begun and that the Earth will warm by more than four degrees  on average in the next century.    All the modelers stress how uncertain the forecasts are. ""People are hedging,""  Washington said. ""You get put into a defensive position, because everyone wants  the lower estimates.""    Given all the uncertainties, what is known for sure? It is agreed that carbon  dioxide has increased over the last 100 years. Since 1958, when accurate  surveys were begun, carbon dioxide has increased from 316 parts per million  parts of air to 353 parts per million today, an 11% increase. This accumulation  is attributed primarily to the burning of fossil fuels, of which the United  States is the largest user.    The basic phenomena of the greenhouse effect are also agreed upon. It has been  operating for millions of years and is one reason Earth is as warm as it is. In  the last few months, the greenhouse effect was actually measured for the first  time by University of Chicago researchers who used satellites to measure  radiation coming into the atmosphere and bouncing back out to space.    So it is almost universally agreed that Earth probably will warm as carbon  dioxide and other greenhouse gases accumulate. How much it warms is the  question.    Richard Lindzen, one of the most outspoken critics of current projections,  conceded at the recent meeting that temperatures probably will rise, but not by  much. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor said he thinks the  planet will respond to the buildup of greenhouse gases by producing ""negative  feedbacks,"" such as high, dry clouds, that will lift warmed air from the ground  toward the upper atmosphere where its heat will radiate into space,  counteracting a warming trend.    But researchers tend to think that while Hansen's projections may be too hot,  Lindzen's are definitely too cold.    Researchers say it may take another decade or more to settle the issues. At  present, the most common response by government officials and scientists has  been a call for more research and a push to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide  by increasing energy efficiency -- a painless remedy that would provide  benefits regardless of future temperatures.

By WILLIAM BOOTH, THE WASHINGTON POST      The most dire predictions about global warming are being toned down by many  experts, who now predict that temperatures and sea levels in the next century  will not rise as dramatically as once feared.    While climate researchers tend to agree that our grandchildren will inherit a  warmer world, many scientists are now betting on an average warming of only  three or four degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, the low end  of a range that prognosticators once put as high as nine degrees.    A rise in sea level, one of the most feared consequences of global warming,  also is expected to be far less drastic than previously thought, largely  because of the surprising observation that the polar ice sheets are not  melting, but growing in size. According to Mark Meier of the Institute of  Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, the consensus now is  that sea level will rise by about a foot in the next century, rather than the  three feet that had been suggested in previous studies.    But even if the revised forecast is correct, there would be major effects, the  scientists warn. A one-foot rise in sea level would inundate some shorelines,  moving the water's edge inland by hundreds or thousands of feet. And a global  warming of only a few degrees might upset communities of plants and animals  that have developed over millennia.

0,FT931-9737 ,"FT931-9737 _AN-DBLB0ACKFT 930212   FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed outlook for Australian exports      By EMILIA TAGAZA      MELBOURNE   AUSTRALIA'S COMMODITY exports face mixed prospects in the next five years, with mineral and energy resources providing the main boost to the sagging economy. The official forecasting agency, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, says the minerals sector will see a reasonable improvement in prices in the medium term while prices of agricultural commodities will stay relatively flat, then start to drift down again after 1995. Mr Brian Fisher, executive director of Abare, told an annual forecasting conference last week that Australia's commodity exports in 1992-93 would rise 8 per cent to ADollars 47.4bn, thanks mainly to the weaker Australian dollar. Minerals would hold their ground in the 1990s, he said, with several major new projects planned or being put into operation this year. These included the world class Yandi and Marandoo iron ore mines, Mt Keith and Yackabindie nickel mines, and Century and McArthur River lead and zinc mines. Mr Jerry Ellis, executive general manager of BHP Minerals, said that during the last two years, the mineral and energy sector grew 4.2 per cent annually, compared with the average growth of 0.9 per cent of the Australian economy. Abare expects gold production to fall slightly to 238 tonnes in 1992-93, followed by similar declines in the following two years. However, output should grow strongly to 255 tonnes in 1995. Expenditure in gold exploration in the next three years is expected to remain at the current level of just over ADollars 300m. Abare also forecasts strong growth in Australian coal exports despite falling prices. Exports of black coal are forecast to reach 188m tonnes in 2004 from the current rate of 126m tonnes a year, while Thermal coal exports are expected to double in that period to 124m tonnes a year. Asian demand for thermal coal is expected to double from about 96m tonnes in 1996-97 to about 187m tonnes by 2004. Japanese thermal coal imports are also forecast to rise strongly, from 49m tonnes to about 86m tonnes in 2004. Wheat also has a good outlook despite weaker prices. A few days after Australia was forced to import wheat for the first time in more than 40 years, Abare predicted a 20 per cent increase in planting, expecting to result in a significant increase on this year's harvest of 15.3m tonnes. It said there were several factors causing world demand for wheat to outstrip production. On the downtrend is wool, of which Australia has an oversupply despite falling production. Abare forecasts that 1992-93 shorn wool production will fall to 837,000 tonnes in 1992-93 from 875,000 tonnes last year. But Mr Mac Drysdale, chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, told the Abare conference that if wool was a manufactured product the factory would now be closed. 'We have 3.98m bales in the official stockpile. We have a growing unofficial stockpile where growers are holding wool back in stores on farms. We have a semi-processed stockpile and at the same time we have relatively high production figures in Australia,' Mr Drysdale said.   Countries:-  AUZ  Australia.

0,FT921-3356 ,"FT921-3356 _AN-CCNAEADFFT 920314   FT  14 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: Welcome to Beanland, home of the hunter      By KAREN FRICKER   LL Bean, the mythic purveyor of rugged outdoor wear to sophisticated modern American urbanites, has started to woo the British market. From their own front rooms the British can now leaf through a catalogue, pick up a telephone, and order the appurtenances of a simpler, hardier, more old-fashioned way of life. For those who wonder what all the fuss is about Karen Fricker makes a pilgrimage to the LL Bean headquarters in Freeport, Maine, the shrine where Americans go to rediscover the America of long ago. IT IS a good thing that the foyer of the LL Bean Store in Freeport, Maine is filled with benches. Entering the only retail outlet of America's most venerable purveyor of outdoor goods and clothing can be overwhelming. Confronted with the American dream realised the hardiest of shoppers needs a sit-down. Last year 3.5m shoppers visited the Freeport store. For Americans, going to Bean is a primal urge, somewhere between family responsibility  - the required visit to eccentric old Uncle LL, as Reader's Digest has dubbed him, who sends us packages - and pilgrimage, to the shrine of an America we wish still existed. In his indoor trout pond (on the main floor, between men's flannel-lined hunting trousers and Gore-Tex anoraks) Americans can wash away the ignominy of mass-marketing, and rediscover the values LL represents - authenticity, reliability, eco-sensitivity, outdoorsiness, hardiness, honesty. The United States of Bean meticulously cultivates its image, posting narratives about company history and 'Our People' (Bean employees), and letters from satisfied customers (one young man who lives at the South Pole jogs happily around Antarctica in Bean extra-strength thermal underwear). Some features of Bean's old-fashioned America jar the 90s consciousness. Though Bean aggressively markets its greenness - sponsoring outdoor discovery programmes and talks about conservation - it also sells a huge selection of shotguns and plays 'how-to-kill-deer' videos in the hunting department. The company and most of its shoppers see no contradiction. Bean was founded to sell hunting gear to hunters, and that purpose remains, although these days real hunters are probably outnumbered by urban bargainovores who covet the country look, like their British counterparts in Barbours and tweeds. Bean, in keeping with its homey image, used only staff as models until the company was attacked because its catalogue contained only white faces. Public relations director Catharine Hartnett, said this was a reflection of the homogeneity of the applicant pool: 'There's not much cultural diversity in Southern Maine.' In the last couple of years the company has started using professional models, of all races, in its catalogue. Best to ignore these little quirks. Sometimes it has not done to look behind the scenes at Disneyland, either. Bean is better than Disneyland: you get the fantasy, and you can shop too. Frontierland with bargains. Adventureland, and you take the coonskin cap and flannel shirt home. And it never closes. Bean is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Excessive? Perhaps. That's Maine for you. That's America. And bottom line, Bean delivers. Between the fun and not-so-practical bits, the store is full of useful, well-made goods. Does the couple from suburban Boston really need an ice fishing shelter (Dollars 76 - Pounds 43.10)? No, but after testing out the floor sample, they can pick up something they might actually use: flannel sheets (Dollars 28) perhaps, or wool blankets (Dollars 180). Will the Florida family really use sleeping bags guaranteed to - 40`F? No, but they probably will use Bean's own brand mountain bikes (Dollars 240) or a Gore-Tex insulated lunchbox (Dollars 14.95) A latter-day Alice's Restaurant, you can get anything you want at Bean: your can get food pancake mix, smoked salmon, Rain Forest Crunch nut brittle, freeze-dried gourmet meals for camping and Walker's shortbread. You can get socks, you can get skis, you can get postcards (and post them in the store), and you can, of course, get Bean's well-made, durable, natural-fibre clothing: chinos, denims, sweaters, turtlenecks. In recent years Bean has introduced a line of what it thinks is fashionable, upscale clothing, but the results have never risen above the frumpy. The Beanland boom began in the late 70s when the company expanded its annual turnover from Dollars 50m to Dollars 250m, and out-of-town visitors started trickling into Freeport to see what the excitement was about. Canny retailers, wanting a piece of the action, bought property up and down Freeport's main street and opened factory outlet stores, offering seconds and off-season merchandise at cut-rate prices. There are now more than 100 retail stores in the Freeport area, from Dansk housewares, to Bass and Timberland shoes, to quality clothing merchants - Brooks Brothers, Evan Picone, Ralph Lauren Polo - to America's most popular casual clothing chains - J. Crew, The Gap, Banana Republic. Freeport has become the leading example of the new American phenomenon of the town defined by shopping: the factory outlet centre. LL Bean's Freeport store may be important to the American identity, but it plays a relatively small role in the Bean company's total business. Mail-order is Bean's backbone - last year it made up 88 per cent of total sales - and has been since 1912, when founder Leon Leonwood 'LL' Bean sent out the first circular advertising his Maine Hunting Boots - leather uppers sewn on to rubber bottoms, still the company's best known product. Company president Leon Gorman has authorised several international ventures, in spite of his grandfather LL's famous dictum against foreign expansion: 'I'm eating three meals a day now, I can't eat four.' Bean has marketed aggressively to the Japanese and Canadian markets since 1989, and last autumn started advertising its catalogues in the British media. Most recently Japanese companies Seiyu and Matsushita Electrical Industrial Company formed 'LL Bean Japan', a joint venture company that will open five retail stores in Japan exclusively for the sale of LL Bean merchandise. To order the postal catalogue or goods phone 1-207-865-3111, fax 1-207-878-2104. or write to LL Bean Freeport, ME 04033, US. There is a toll-free number in the US: 1-800-221-4221 and a British address for UK orders: PO BOX 54, Swindon, SN5 8LB. Would-be buyers based in the UK should remember to add duty (at 14 per cent) and VAT (at 17.5 per cent) to the cost of orders.  The Financial Times   London Page XV  "

Khasapopoulos]    [Text] Foreign military attaches, mainly European and  American, have lately been seen visiting the Defense Ministry as  a delegation of higher-ranking officers of the National Defense  General Staff [YEETHA] prepares to pay an official visit to  Cyprus to cooperate with Cypriot National Guard officers to draw  up a unified defense strategy. There has not been so much  movement of foreign officials and diplomats at the Pentagon  [Greek military headquarters] since March 1987, during the  Greek-Turkish crisis over the search for oil by the ""Piri Reis""  [Turkish oil exploration ship] in the Aegean.    Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's proclaimed new  strategy of unified defense between Greece and Cyprus and  Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis' meetings in Thessaloniki  with Miltiadhis Evert, New Democracy and official opposition  leader, and Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, during which the  exclusive topic of discussion was the unified defense space  between Greece and Cyprus, appear to have raised concern among  NATO military attaches. The NATO military attaches in Athens  immediately requested a meeting with the ministry's military  leadership for further clarification. It is indicative that the  military attaches of Germany, Britain, and the United States  asked Arsenis if NATO knows about Greece's plans to expand its  defense space. U.S. Ambassador Thomas Niles also asked Arsenis  the same question.    Arsenis' answer is that Greece, as a guarantor power in  Cyprus, is obliged to look after its defense and he stated that  in 1960, Greece did not inform NATO that it was sending the  900-member ELDIK [Greek Forces in Cyprus] to the island, as part  of the Zurich Agreement. Turkey did the same with TURDIK  [Turkish Forces in Cyprus]. Arsenis assured the foreign  diplomats that the military plans being drawn up for Cyprus'  defense are clearly defensive, not offensive. He also noted  that Greece and Cyprus estimate that they face the same threat,  which comes exclusively from Turkey, and must prepare a common  defense.    There has been no official Turkish response yet, despite  Turkey's military delegation at NATO seeking in every way to  learn Greece's plans. But there has been reaction by Britain.  Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind expressed particular interest  in the issue during a recent meeting with Defense Minister  Arsenis in Brussels on the sidelines of the NATO summit.  British Ambassador in Athens Anthony Miles has requested an  official meeting with Arsenis and one of the issues that will be  discussed is the defense of Cyprus, since Britain is also among  Cyprus' guarantor powers.    The first step toward common defense is Lieutenant General  Nikolaos Vorvolakos' appointment as commander of the National  Guard. Vorvolakos is being briefed at headquarters. The second  and perhaps most important step will be the visit this week of a  delegation of military officers to Nicosia to draw up the new  defense plan to cover both countries. The third step will be  National Defense Minister Arsenis' visit to Cyprus during the  second half of February and the last will be the signing of an  accord by Prime Minister Papandreou and Cypriot President  Kliridhis, probably at the beginning of the summer.

According to the newspaper, which is published in this  capital, Foreign Minister Amorim referred indirectly to the U.S.  embargo against Cuba at a lunch with Lage on 3 February when he  condemned some countries' adoption of unilateral measures,  disregarding international law.    According to this publication, Amorim kept reiterating such  actions undermine both Brazil and Cuba's development.    Commenting on this, Amorim said his country rejects the  imposition of extraterritorial law (Torricelli Law) on third  countries, although he did not specifically mention the  Torricelli Law, also known as the law for democracy in Cuba.    Amorim discussed his expectations regarding political  changes  in Cuba, and expressed his support for Cuba's reintegration in  the hemisphere.    He pointed out that Brazil and Cuba can join forces to  overcome their weaknesses, and cited as an example the benefits  that should result from a recent bilateral agreement, by which  the Brazilian market will obtain Cuban medicines.    Amorim said the Federal Government will distribute the  medicines to the poorest people of this country for free.    Amorim also referred to cooperation with Cuba in sugar,  science, and technical areas.    Meanwhile, in an interview by a Brazil news agency, Lage  emphasized that the U.S. blockade against his country has caused  many problems, and he said Latin American rejection of this  aggression is important.    According to the news agency, Lage told Amorim that Cuba is  interested in paying off a $30-million debt with Brazil, making  the medicines' agreement possible. The value of the medicine is  greater than the debt.    Lage noted that the medicines' agreement will also promote  Cuban-Brazilian economic relations, and added that Brazilian  businessmen are interested in investing in Cuba, especially in  tourism, health, agriculture, and biotechnology.    According to JORNAL DO BRASILIA and the Brazil news agency,  Cuba has placed special emphasis on tourism and oil. The  newspaper says Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum], a state oil  company, invested in oil exploration in Cuba, but stopped its  operations. The publication stresses that the Cuban Government  wants Petrobras to resume those activities.    According to the sources, Lage believes his visit to Brazil  will help achieve an increase in bilateral trade.    JORNAL DO BRASILIA says that, according to Lage, in 1992,  Cuban cash purchases to Brazil totaled $47 million, and  consisted mainly of food, spare parts, chemical products, and so  on.    On the third day of his visit to Brazil, Lage will lunch  with  Health Minister Henrique Santillo, then later he will meet with  the vice president of the Brazil-Cuba Friendship Associations.  The itinerary will conclude with a news conference.    On Saturday, Lage and his delegation will arrive in Rio de  Janeiro for a 48-hour stay. Lage's official visit will conclude  on Monday with his departure to Santa Fe de Bogota, Colombia.     "

Such expectations were expressed on the first day of the  year  by President Fidel Castro, who estimated that the sector must  continue to increase crude oil production and that initial  exploration, currently carried out in association with foreign  companies, must begin to show results.    For the first time in 30 years, Cuban oil workers produced  more than a million tons of a oil in a 12-month period.  Specialists describe the oil as dense, viscous, and with high  light hydrocarbon content, which makes it more flammable and  thus harder to control.    The 1.1 million tons of oil expected to have been produced  by  the end of the year would represent savings of $45 million to  the national economy and have helped generate 30 percent of the  electricity used in the country.    In addition, hydrocarbon by-products were used to make  cement  and basic oils, the latter basically used to produce lubricants.    Cuba's record high oil production was the 938,000 tons  reached in 1986. Successive productions were 894,600 (87),  716,800 (88), 718,400 (89), 670,800 (90), 521,800 (91), and  882,100 (92).    According to sources at Cubapetroleo, the drop between 1987  and 1991 was basically due to the depletion of the Boca de  Jaruco deposit, approximately 45 km east of Havana.    This last deposit and the one in Varadero (140 km east of  Havana) were the most important in the archipelago; 20  additional deposits have been discovered there in the last 30  years.    During this period -- according to GRANMA -- 65,000 km of  seismic lines [lineas sismicas] were completed; 1.5 million  meters of deep shafts were perforated; magnetic, radioactive,  and geological surveys [levantamientos] were conducted; and the  use of aerial and satellite photography was regularized to study  the natural oil and gas [gasopetroliferas] possibilities.    Oil prospecting gained strength by the end of last year,  when  11 plots on land and superficial waters in the Cuban insular  platform were offered for international bidding in Canada and  London.    This made possible -- according to TRABAJADORES -- the  securing of a large number of contracts with foreign firms,  including the UK's Premier company (to explore 2,990 square km)  and France's Geopetrol (1,600 km).    Jean Louis Remondin, board member of the French enterprise,  told the local press that he was confident that there were  important reserves of the so-called black gold in Cuba.    The geographic location and the geological and geophysical  characteristics of the territory contradict those who doubt the  existence of more oil in the island, the specialist added.    In addition to the exploration contracts, Geopetrol has  similar agreements to recover and improve the Cuban deposits,  especially those in the Yumuri Valley, Puerto Escondido, and  Martin Mesa, all in the western part of the country.

The Chinese premier made the remarks during his meeting with  Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. presidential national security  adviser here today.    He said that China will not export its own ideology nor its  concept of values; neither will it allow any country to impose  its ideology or concept of values on China.    China respects the internal affairs of other countries and  will never allow any other country to attempt to interfere in  China's internal affairs and detract China from its own road of  development, he stressed.    Li said that China's present policy and road of development,  which are based on prolonged efforts of exploration and  practice, conform to the fundamental interests of the Chinese  people.    The premier said that great changes has taken place in the  world since Brzezinski's previous visit to China more than six  years ago.    China takes economic development as its central task and  pursues a foreign policy of maintaining independence and keeping  the initiative in its own hands, Premier Li Peng said, and these  should be the basic starting point for foreign observers to  understand China.    ""Foreign statesmen will surely make mistakes in their  decision- making if they base their understanding of China  merely on the words or views of a tiny number of Chinese to the  ignorance of the interests and wishes of all other Chinese  people,"" the premier said.    Li said that China's development and growth in its strength  constitute an important factor contributing to world peace,  adding that in international exchange, China strictly observes  the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, posing no threat  to any other country or provoking any disputes or confrontation.    On Sino-U.S. relations, Li said he appreciated President  Clinton's attitude of hoping to see a powerful, stable and  prosperous China and the Chinese Government hopes that Sino-U.S.  relations will gradually improve and develop.    Brzezinski said that China is a very important country, both  regionally and globally, and it is a major factor for world  stability.    He believed that a closer U.S.-Sino relationship would be  good for both countries and this fact cannot be changed by the  differences between them.    Expressing his happiness with China's progress in its  foreign  relations, Brzezinski said that he had carefully studied Premier  Li's recent speeches concerning China's policy of developing  relations with four Central Asian countries, and he believed the  policies were of universal significance.    From a long-term point of view, he said that he was  optimistic about the future of U.S.-Sino relations, which will  occupy a most important position in the U.S. foreign policy.    Prior to the meeting, Premier Li Peng gave a brief interview  to CBS reporter Constance Yu-hwa Chung and answered her  questions on U.S.-Sino relations.     "
0,FT923-2694 ,"FT923-2694 _AN-CIPCHAFFFT 920916   FT  16 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining ministers come under attack - Canadian report confirms increased investment abroad at expense of home budgets   Canada's mining industry will be giving federal and provincial mines ministers a hard time when the ministers hold their annual meeting in the Yukon this month. Top of the agenda will be a report on the investment climate in Canada by a government-industry task force. The report, not yet made public, will confirm that Canadian mining companies are cutting exploration budgets at home while increasing investment elsewhere. 'It's not that the bottom is falling out, but there's a drift away from Canada's attractiveness,' says Mr George Miller, president of the Canadian Mining Association in Ottawa. Others are more forthright. Mr Jim O'Rourke, president of Princeton Mining of Vancouver and chairman of the British Columbia Mining Association, complained in a recent speech that 'the resource industries of the province have been milked and drained to support costly government programmes and a standard of living which makes our operations uncompetitive in international markets.' Evidence of mining companies' unhappiness with the business climate in Canada is not hard to find. Falconbridge, the big nickel producer, has closed its exploration office in Vancouver and moved five employees and their families to Santiago, Chile. A growing number of junior mining companies listed on the Vancouver stock exchange have their operations outside Canada. About 40 Canadian mining companies are now active in Chile, helping to make Canada the biggest foreign investor there in 1991. Others have gone to the US, Mexico, Australia, Indonesia and elsewhere. 'The exodus is now in full swing,' said Mr Robert Holbauer, Cominco's president, in a speech earlier this year. The discontent is greatest in Ontario and British Columbia, which are both ruled by interventionist, social-democratic governments. By contrast, Mr Claude Drouin, general manager of the Quebec Mining Association, says companies in the francophone province have a 'fairly good relationship' with the government. Manitoba recently unveiled incentives, including cash grants, to encourage exploration. The list of complaints is long, but can be grouped into three main categories: high taxes, lengthy delays in getting projects off the ground, and increasingly rigorous environmental assessments. The tax burden on mining companies in Canada is among the highest in the world. But the industry is especially critical of a lengthening list of government levies which bear no relation to profits. These include licensing fees, fuel taxes and the spiralling cost of funding workers' compensation claims. The Ontario Mining Association estimates that its members are exposed to a CDollars 1bn unfunded liability in the province's workers' compensation fund. Muncipalities in the province went a step further recently by suggesting that they be allowed to levy property taxes on underground facilities as if they were on the surface. Sandy Laird, senior vice-president of Placer Dome, the Vancouver-based gold producer, said earlier this year that 'the probability is that future changes will increase, not decrease, the tax burden for the mining industry. From the point of view of tax, British Columbia must be counted as a high-risk region.' The industry also frets about long delays in the approval process for new mines without any assurance that, in the end, the projects will be allowed to go ahead. Mr O'Rourke gives the example of a relatively small garnet quarry in British Columbia, where the provincial government has insisted on a study on markets and competitors before it allows construction to proceed. Placer Dome estimates that the project-approval process lasts an average of more than two years in BC compared to about a year in Nevada and Papua New Guinea, six months in Australia and virtually no delay at all in Chile. 'The stonewalling is the worst of it,' says a Falconbridge official. Besides the usual criticism about bureaucratic inefficiency, applications for mining rights are invariably bogged down by environmental concerns and by disputed aboriginal land claims. 'We're not against the environment,' says Mr Drouin in Quebec, 'but it's difficult to break a rock without creating dust and making a noise.'' The most bitter battle is taking place over the Windy Craggy property, located amid the spectacular mountains of northwest BC Geddes Resources of Toronto has spent some CDollars 50m evaluating what appears to be Canada's biggest copper and cobalt deposit. But the provincial parks service and environmental groups throughout North America are pushing hard to kill the project before a mine is built. Mining executives acknowledge that their complaints might be less strident if commodity prices - and therefore profits - were higher, or share prices stronger. According to a Price Waterhouse study, mines in British Columbia, lost CDollars 1.04bn in 1990 and another CDollars 485m last year. But the companies also say some concerns have little to do with the business cycle. Mr Holbauer said in his last annual report that other countries were seeking to attract mining investment through changes to ownership laws, lower tax rates and minimising red tape.

0,FT931-1210 ,"FT931-1210 _AN-DCZBZAA7FT 930326   FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investment famine blights Filipino mining outlook - The high price being paid for the country's high-risk reputation      By JOSE GALANG   THE PHILIPPINES' mining industry is paying dearly for its inability to attract development capital for over a decade now. Total value of mineral production declined last year by 14 per cent to 20.65bn pesos (Pounds 575m), according to the Bureau of Mines and Geosciences. It blames the fall on low metal prices, increased operating costs and 'poor access to replacement capital'. Copper concentrates output dropped by 8.9 per cent to 521,258 tonnes, which was also only half the annual production achieved in the early 1980s. Gold output declined 12 per cent to 22.7 tonnes the lowest level since 1980. Chromite production also slumped while nickel output was marginally higher. Mining officials say the outlook for the next five years remains bleak, and the industry is likely to miss out on any recovery from the current slowdown in world metals markets. 'Because we have not developed any new ore bodies in the past decade there is nothing to work on,' explains Mr Joel Muyco, director of the mines bureau. He says that risk capital in the local mining sector has been scarce because the country has been considered a high-risk area since the early 1980s in view of the local political and economic crises. Perceptions of instability have countered the attractions of the country's huge proven reserves of such minerals as copper, gold, chromite and nickel. In terms of resource endowment (which indicates the potential for discovering an ore body) the country continues to rank among the highest in Asia. 'When the good times come, we have no new ore bodies to offer,' says Mr Muyco. Much of the available risk capital is now moving towards other mineral-rich countries such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, Mexico and Chile. The Philippines hopes to attract these capital flows, however, with a new Mining Code that allows 100 per cent foreign equity in a local mining venture. This is actually contained in an executive order issued in 1987 by Mrs Corazon Aquino, the former president. Unfortunately, most foreign investors continue to be hesitant because the Aquino order was issued a few months before the country adopted a new constitution, which, among other provisions, limited the exploitation of natural resources to companies with majority Filipino interests. Mr Fidel Ramos, the new president, is set to sign 'any day now' the first financial and technical assistance agreement under the new mining code, according to Mr Muyco. The scheme allows foreign operators to undertake minerals exploration for their own account, instead of acting as service contractors for local groups. They are required to spend a minimum of Dollars 50m, and to reduce their holdings to 40 per cent after recovering their original investments, which could take 18 to 20 years. The first financial and technical assistance agreement authorises Arimco of Australia to explore for copper and gold in a 30,000-hectare (75,000-acre) area in Nueva Vizcaya province in Luzon. A second, with Western Mining of Australia, is already lined up for approval.   Countries:-  PHZ  Philippines, Asia.   Industries:-  P1021 Copper Ores.     P1041 Gold Ores.

The companies have put in bids for building facilities to exploit gold and silver deposits, which are owned by Rosario Dominicana, the state company, in Pueblo Viejo in the island's north. The development of the facility follows the exhaustion of reserves in the oxide zone of the mine, and a decline in the country's gold and silver output in recent years. Bids are being considered from four companies - Davy McKee of the UK, Minproc Engineering and BHP Utah International of Australia, and Paulo Abib/Andrea Gutierrez of Brazil. The favoured company will be granted a Dollars 200m contract. Rosario Dominicana expects that the Pueblo Viejo sulphide zone will yield an average of 1,100 ounces of gold (with 40 per cent silver content) a day. The country expects to earn about USDollars 7bn before the deposits are exhausted. All the companies have presented projects that would take between two and 2 1/2 years to complete. The board of Rosario Dominicana is evaluating the bids, and such is the importance which the government has attached to the venture that the final decision on the award of the contract will be taken by President Balaguer. The development and exploitation of the sulphide zone will reverse the trend in the decline in production of precious metals. Gold production in 1981 was 412,991 ounces, but fell gradually to 138,640 ounces in 1990 and is estimated to have been slightly less last year. 'Gold production has been falling as the oxide deposits have been exhausted and attention has been turned to a transition zone,' says Mr Gerald Ellis, director-general for minerals. That zone will be worked for three years and then the sulphite zone will be exploited for about 25 years. The transition zone will be mined until 1993 and is expected to yield gold and silver worth about Dollars 125m. Earnings from the expanded gold-mining venture will lift the country's already significant minerals sector, now dominated by nickel production. The Dominican Republic is the world's seventh largest nickel producer and the second largest after Canada in the western hemisphere. The country's proven reserves are about 37.8m tonnes with a grading of 1.72 per cent nickel. The only producer, Falconbridge Dominicana, a subsidiary of a Canadian company, has a facility with a capacity of 63m lb a year. The industry, which has overtaken sugar as the main foreign currency earner for the Dominican Republic, has been troubled by domestic and market problems in recent years. The plant was shut in 1988 as the company and the government argued over an export levy. The issue was resolved when the government guaranteed the company's mining operations and exports, while the company allowed the state an increased share in profits. More recently, the industry was affected by low prices and weak demand for nickel. Exports last year are estimated to have been slightly lower that the 67.4m lb exported in 1990, and which were valued at Dollars 262.1m. The reduced production was caused by a cutback in production by Falconbridge in the last quarter of last year because of low prices. 'Several companies are involved in exploration for precious and base metals in other parts of the country,' says Mr Ellis. 'There is some hope of finding another major gold deposit, and several major Japanese, US and Canadian companies are in the hunt.' The companies include the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan and Canyon Resources and Battle Mountain of the US. At the same time, a number of companies is involved in oil exploration as the government attempts to reduce its dependence on foreign oil, and to ensure that its electricity generating capacity is below demand. The company needs about 23m barrels of oil a year, and the government clearly hopes that two ventures will yield oil. Mobil of the US and Once Once, a joint US/Dominican venture are exploring areas offshore and onshore for which they have been granted licences. 'The Dominican Republic has a policy which is favourable to investments in petroleum and mining,' says Mr Ellis. 'The country is willing to welcome any company which comes. The paperwork and the bureaucracy are slow, but we are trying to speed up things.' The bauxite mining industry is in an uncertain state. Mines which were worked by the Aluminum Company of America were closed in 1982 after declining production. The Dominican Republic, a founding member of the International Bauxite Association, a producers' organisation, lost its membership when the industry died. There have since been bauxite shipments from the country when agreed quantities are mined by a local company, Ideal Dominicana, for the Aluminum Company of America. Most of this has been to fill shortfalls in Alcoa's operations, notably in Surinam when that industry was affected two years ago by anti-government rebels. Mr Ellis reported that the Dominican Republic has 15m tonnes of bauxite reserves, and that Alcoa ordered 150,000 tonnes of ore last year. The order was not filled as President Balaguer suspended mining because of increasing local concern over deforestation and other adverse environmental effects. The government has also been trying to expand production of other minerals. Corde, the holding company for state enterprises, is attempting to increase output of gypsum, lifting production which was 75,000 tonnes in 1990, to about 250,000 tonnes a year. There are also plans to lift marble extraction well beyond current levels which average 20,000 cubic metres a year. Limestone production has also fluctuated in recent years, moving from 350,000 tonnes in 1989 to 503,000 tonnes last year.  The Financial Times   London Page 34  "

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been hailed in Athens as a vindication of its long-standing argument that it has the right to extend its territorial waters from 6 miles to 12. Turkey has said that any such move by Athens would turn the Aegean into a 'Greek lake' and would be resisted by force. Greece says it has no plans to extend its territorial waters, but it will not renounce the right to do so. An opinion poll published this week showed that 79 per cent of Turks would support war if Greece declared a 12-mile limit. The quarrel dates from an offshore oil strike west of the Greek island of Thasos more than 20 years ago. The Athens government rejects Turkish proposals for joint oil exploration in the Aegean. The Cape St George, a US cruiser equipped with the latest electronic surveillance devices, was yesterday tracking Turkish warships and Greek aircraft across the Aegean. President Bill Clinton has written to the leaders of both countries urging them to show restraint and avoid the risk of clashes. Mr Mumtaz Soysal, the Turkish foreign minister, said Ankara has assured Mr Clinton that it had taken all possible measures to avoid a clash. Mr Soysal met Mr Karolos Papoulis, his Greek counterpart, in The Hague this week, but there was little sign of a change in positions. Turkey wants across-the-board negotiations on all the issues which it says are in dispute. Greece says the only issue that needs discussing is that of seabed mineral rights, which it wants settled by international arbitration. Relations between Athens and Ankara have also been worsened by the war in former Yugoslavia, where Turkey supports the Bosnian Moslems while Greece has traditional links with the Serbs. Turkey was the only European member of Nato to support the US withdrawal from the arms embargo against Bosnia. Recently, Turkey gave a new thrust to the old antagonisms by accusing Greece of harbouring guerrillas from the separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) fighting in eastern Turkey. The US Navy, in this year's annual intelligence report, described the Greek-Turkish standoff as one of the 'most worrisome situations developing in Europe and the most dangerous to Nato as an institution'. The report says tension in the Aegean has also been stoked by supplies to both countries of new and secondhand ships from other Nato countries. Diplomats said they were alarmed that a hot-line between the two countries, set up after they came close to war in 1987, had ceased to function. Turkey is conducting its manoeuvres this week in international waters in the northern Aegean. About 100 miles to the south, the Greek navy is in charge of a Nato exercise held every year involving ships and aircraft from the US, France, Italy, Spain and the UK.

The previous biggest decline in domestic oil output was 474,000 barrels per day  in 1949.    Alaskan oil production, which had increased almost every year since the start  of production from the huge Prudhoe Bay field in 1977, fell by 140,000 barrels  per day in 1989.    The report said the Alaska decline was exaggerated by maintenance work and  traffic restrictions following the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill last March,  and that the ""underlying decline trend"" in Alaska was about 100,000 barrels per  day.

The report said that while imports from Western Hemisphere sources still  accounted for about 43% of total imports in 1989, imports from the Persian Gulf  continued to grow to 21% of the total.

0,FT932-8300 ,"FT932-8300 _AN-DESCQAG5FT 930519   FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (6): Welcoming magnet for multinationals - Mining plays a crucial role      By LESLIE CRAWFORD   Enormous mineral resources, a welcoming foreign investment regime and sound macroeconomic fundamentals have transformed Chile into a magnet for mining multinationals. The foreign companies flocking to Chile reads like a Who's Who of the mining world: Anglo-American, Bema Gold, BHP, Chevron, Cominco - and all the way down the alphabet to RTZ and Shell/Billiton. The Chilean Copper Commission, Cochilco, estimates that Dollars 5bn worth of investment will be channelled into the mining sector to explore, develop or expand projects. Nowhere else in the world are there so many projects so close to fruition. Chile is the world's leading copper producer: about Dollars 4bn of this foreign investment is being channelled into new copper mines. The country has one-quarter of the world's known copper reserves. Some Dollars 560m in gold projects will move Chile up the ladder of the world's top 10 gold producers. A further Dollars 405m is being invested in non-metallics such as iodine and nitrates. Chile's mining sector plays a crucial role in its economy, accounting for almost half of exports and 15 per cent of GDP. According to some estimates, mining production will increase more than 50 per cent by the year 2000. High ore grades at new mines mean that Chile will also continue to be one of the world's lowest cost producers. One estimate by Cochilco puts copper production rising from 1.94m tonnes last year to 2.18m tonnes in 1994. The mining boom has been several years in the making. General Pinochet, who ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990, wooed back mining multinationals with a liberal foreign investment regime and a mining code which grants property rights over mining concessions. The return of democracy in 1990 did not upset this vigorous activity, as the new government decided to keep the mining and investment codes intact. More than half of Chile's copper is mined by Codelco, the state-owned Chilean Copper Corporation. But Codelco's four mines, including Chuquicamata, the world's largest, are old. Production is in decline, operating costs are rising, and the powerful Copper Workers' Union, with 19,000 members, has blocked management plans to reduce overmanning. Nevertheless, Codelco has a plan to reverse its dwindling fortunes. Voluntary redundancies and a crackdown on absenteeism increased labour productivity by 6 per cent last year, according to Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's vice-president for development. The state concern has also launched an exploration drive to find new reserves. An important breakthrough for Codelco came with the approval of a new law in 1992, authorising the state company to form joint ventures with the private sector. Earlier this year, Codelco invited 20 mining companies to bid for the exploration rights to four of its mining prospects. The idea, says Mr Bande, is to allow Codelco to share the risk of exploration. He expects the first joint-venture agreements to be concluded about the middle of the year. Codelco owns one-third of the registered mining property in Chile. Investment, however, has been limited by budget constraints dictated by the finance ministry. Mr Bande sees the joint ventures as a way of tapping the huge mineral potential that Codelco is unable to develop on its own. In addition, Codelco has completed the basic engineering for Radomiro Tomic, a huge ore body discovered near Chuquicamata. The new mine is scheduled to enter production in 1995. Radomiro Tomic will be a test case for the state-owned copper company. It is the first mine that Codelco is developing from scratch, and the challenge will be to produce copper as cheaply and efficiently as the private sector. Mr Bande says Codelco is in the process of getting the final financial approval for Radomiro Tomic, which will require an investment of Dollars 450m. Once it is up and running, the mine will add 150,000 tonnes of copper to the 1.15m tonnes produced by Codelco's other divisions. Most of Chile's increased copper output, however, will come from private sector projects. Leading the wave of foreign investment, La Escondida - the richest copper deposit in the world - entered production in December 1990. La Escondida is jointly owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ and a consortium of Japanese smelters led by Mitsubishi. The Dollars 900m project was completed six months ahead of schedule - a tribute to the engineering and organisational skills of the mainly Chilean contractors. The mine, located in the Atacama desert, last year exported about 760,000 tonnes of copper concentrates (a semi-refined product equivalent to about 320,000 tonnes of refines copper), making it the second-biggest copper operation in the world. The company is studying plans to increase production by a further 80,000 tonnes - the output of a medium-sized mine - by 1994. It is testing a method to process the extra tonnage into pure copper cathodes, using a new technique which does not require smelting. Exxon Minerals, of the US, is close to completing a Dollars 400m expansion programme at its Los Bronces copper mine which will double production to 200,000 tonnes a year. Cominco of Canada recently wrapped up the Dollars 250m financing to develop its Quebrada Blanca copper deposit in the Atacama desert. It expects the mine will enter into production in 1994 with an output of 75,000 tonnes a year. Phelps Dodge of the US is expanding its Ojos del Salado mine and plans to develop a deposit known as La Candelaria, already being dubbed Chile's new Escondida. Outokumpu of Finland recently sold half of its Zaldivar copper deposit to Placer Dome for Dollars 100m. The Canadian resources group also agreed to finance up to Dollars 400m towards the cost of development. Minorco, an investment company owned by Anglo-American of South Africa, paid the record price to enter a copper project last year. Minorco shelled out Dollars 190m to buy Chevron's (the US oil group) stake in Collahuasi, a copper deposit high up in the Andes, now owned in equal shares by Minorco, Royal Dutch/Shell and Falconbridge. Minorco estimates Collahuasi's start-up date will be 1996-97. The huge sums being paid by multinationals for a share of Chile's mining bonanza reflects the country's growing reputation as a safe-haven for foreign investment. 'The risk factor is not there,' says one diplomat in Santiago. 'Companies are prepared to pay top dollars for good mining projects.' A comparative example: in Peru, Anglo-American's Chilean subsidiary Mantos Blancos recently acquired the rich Quellaveco copper deposit from state-owned MineroPeru for Dollars 12m. The huge price differential between Quellaveco and Collahuasi, for roughly the same amount of copper reserves, reflects the penalty Peru is still paying for its political instability. The wealth of mining projects, concentrated mainly in Chile's desert north, is putting a strain on the country's underdeveloped infrastructure. Finding water in the driest desert in the world is as much a priority as striking a rich mineral deposit. Electricity is also in short supply. Port facilities are deficient. La Escondida chose to build its own port, rather than compete with Codelco for Antofagasta's overstretched docks. Phelps Dodge, which wants to ship La Candelaria's copper concentrates from the small port of Caldera, is encountering opposition from local fishermen. They fear the loading operation will pollute the bay. Environmental awareness is growing in Chile, and the clash between Phelps Dodge and the fishermen of Caldera is by no means an isolated example. Local farming and fishing communities have recently won important legal victories against the polluting activities of mining operations. The government has begun enforcing stricter air and water pollution controls. Several companies, including Codelco, are now investing millions of dollars to clean up their act.

Chinese and foreign specialists and scholars  submitted 65 academic papers to the conference. The papers show  that they share this common understanding: The integration and  development of economics, science and technology, and laws is a  very important research project. Science and technology are the  motive forces for social progress, the economy is the foundation  of social development, and laws are guarantees for social  progress. The integration and simultaneous development of these  three aspects represent a general trend in today's social  development.    In his speech, Justice Minister Xiao Yang said: The  convocation of this international conference will facilitate the  efforts to explore the operational mechanisms for integrating  economics, science and technology, and laws; to search for ways  to groom and train interdisciplinary personnel; and to promote  academic services, peace, and development in the world.  Moreover, it will benefit contacts and exchanges between people  in economic, scientific and technological, legal, and business  circles in various countries, thereby creating conditions for  forging effective links and cooperation in the future.    In his speech, Zou Yu, president of the Chinese Society of  International Economic, Scientific and Technological, and Legal  Personnel, said: The present-day world is characterized by very  close economic contacts between various countries and regions,  and by an extremely rapid pace of interaction between the  economy on the one hand and science and technology on the other.  The development of these two fields should be guaranteed by  law, and it is increasingly urgent to coordinate and harmonize  various laws. This dictates long-term exchanges and cooperation  between specialists and scholars in various countries in  carrying out strenuous, in-depth exploration and studies in a  joint effort to promote social progress and development.    Attending the conference are more than 60 economic,  scientific and technological, and legal specialists and scholars  from such countries and regions as Germany, Canada, the United  States, Australia, and Austria.

Nigeria has almost 10 times the population of its neighbour and for years the Bakassi peninsula has been mainly inhabited by Nigerians, many of them migrant fishermen. Although this area of south-eastern Nigeria produces 90 per cent of the nation's foreign earnings, the dozens of minority tribes in the region have been, on the government's own admission, neglected. Dispossession or pollution of their farming and fishing areas have not been offset by a share of the oil wealth, which has been invested in the north and west of Nigeria. Large investment in exploration deep offshore could make the region even wealthier in the next century. Bakassi also controls the seaway leading to Calabar, the nearest big Nigerian port and the site of a new Export Processing zone. As the Nigerian government prepares for its delayed constitutional conference, the eastern minorities are arguing for a better deal and more autonomy. The military regime suspects that talk of autonomy could lead to secession and the loss of massive oil wealth. Cameroon's largest and most vocal dissident political grouping, the opposition SDF party, has its stronghold near the border region. The mainly Anglophone region produces most of Cameroon's wealth and is home to more than 2m Nigerians. Bakassi was part of the British-governed southern Cameroons from the First World War until 1961 when the territory voted in a plebiscite to join the newly independent Cameroon. In 1975 at the Marua treaty Nigeria's Gen Yakubu Gowon re-affirmed Cameroon's claim to the area, allegedly to thank Cameroon for providing access to re-capture Calabar during the Biafran war. Nigeria's federal survey department published an atlas in 1978 signed by then head of state Gen Olusegun Obasanjo which clearly shows Bakassi to be in Cameroon. Squabbles over the boundary in the swamps led to a clash of troops in 1981 then the row subsided. But Bakassi became an international dispute early this year when Nigeria moved troops into the peninsula to counter alleged raids by Cameroonian gendarmes against Nigerian fishermen. Last month, Cameroon demanded the withdrawal of the troops from its territory and complained to the United Nations Security Council. After a skirmish on February 18 between rival military patrols in the peninsula, with reports of light casualties on both sides, Cameroon asked France for assistance under a bilateral defence pact. France sent two helicopters and 15 troops to the capital Yaounde, a day's drive from the border, at the same time as a senior diplomatic mission including President Francois Mitterrand's special adviser on Africa, Mr Bruno Delaye, to mediate between the two sides. Both Britain and France are advising that the dispute be resolved in bilateral talks, possibly with some assistance from the international court at The Hague, and both believe that a debate before the UN Security Council, of which France this month is chairman and Nigeria a temporary member, would be acrimonious.

Vladimir Orlov, in an interview with a SEGODNYA  correspondent, explained what prompted his meeting with the  president and its possible consequences.    According to the chairman of the Russian Federation State  Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources,  economically useful minerals and products from the primary  processing of these minerals are, and will remain for the  foreseeable future, the basic source of foreign exchange  receipts for the state treasury. Thus, if all of Russia's  material assets now being used are estimated at about $2  trillion, then proven economically useful mineral reserves that  have been entered on the state balance sheet equal about $28  trillion. According to calculations of experts, all the free  capital on the planet is not enough to master Russian fields.    At present, according to all parameters of per capita  consumption of basic strategic forms of resources, Russia lags  behind the West by two to five times. Thus, according to the  president, it is necessary not to take the path of reducing  consumption of resources, but to qualitatively change the  structure of consumption. And, the market will force, and is  already forcing, conservation of resources, in terms of use per  unit of national product. A reduction of the entire mining and  mineral extraction complex is now taking place, necessitating in  the current period the activization of a purposeful state policy  with respect to this issue.    Weak spots in the development of Russia's raw materials base  and ways of overcoming them were discussed in the conversation.  The president emphasized in the first place that Russia, as a  great power, should and does have ""raw materials"" interests not  only in the countries of the CIS but in the whole world as well,  including the world's oceans (in particular, the president, in  the course of the discussion, repeatedly showed interest in the  development of technology and equipment for underwater  extraction of economically useful minerals). In other words,  problems in developing Russia's mineral-raw materials base have  a geopolitical as well as an economic character.    Boris Yeltsin was interested in the reasons for the decline  in oil and gold extraction, and the state of affairs with  respect to other strategic forms of raw materials, especially  those that have remained outside Russia. Of particular concern  to him was how quickly and at what cost the problem could be  solved. In this respect, the president expressed understanding  of the fact that geologists' work yields a return in 10 to 15  years and that the euphoria over the so-called ""excess of proven  reserves"" of mineral resources is quickly passing. Meanwhile,  investments in the mining and extraction industry yield a  sufficiently rapid return. For example, in explored fields, it  is possible to begin industrial extraction of oil in 1.5 to  three years, scattered gold--in 1.5 to two years, and gold  ore--in four to five years (at most seven years).    In connection with this, variants for attracting additional  investment, including by the state, were examined, as was the  question about what is blocking the attraction of domestic and  foreign investment in the country's mining and mineral  extraction complex.    A second set of questions concerned the organization of the  geological service in Russia, which recently has undergone major  changes and, as a result, has broken up into two components. The  smaller of these (15 percent of overall expenditures in geology)  is linked to providing for Federation-wide needs, including  defense, and is financed through the budget. Included here are  drilling of very deep wells, space programs, drawing geological  maps on a small and intermediate scale, predictions of  earthquakes, work in the world's oceans and the antarctic. Work  of this kind is financed through the state budget in practically  all countries in the world.    The remaining 85 percent of geological expenditures go to  providing for current requirements in mining and mineral  extraction, and related branches. These expenditures are  financed through clients' funds.    Measures for state support of the development of Russia's  mineral-raw materials base and geological service will be  discussed on 7 June at a meeting of the commission for  operational questions in the government. In this connection, the  chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology  and the Use of Mineral Resources noted that geologists were less  in need of new budget infusions than of a resolution of the  nonpayments problem.    In accordance with the system introduced as of 1 January  this  year, all payments for utilization of mineral resources and  taxes remain with regional geological enterprises. However, this  has not substantially affected their financial position. By way  of an example, Viktor Orlov [name as published] showed the  correspondent from the newspaper SEGODNYA a letter from the  general director of the association Tomskneftegazgeologiya, Mr.  Frinovskiy, saying that Tomsk oil workers had not paid R6.3  billion for work carried out in 1993. They had only given the  geologists the right to sell part of the oil extracted for R4  billion and to keep the money for themselves. According to the  chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology  and the Use of Mineral Resources, if the nonpayment problem is  solved, then the mechanism developed by the geologists for  fulfilling the work on Federation-wide and commercial orders  will function properly.    Viktor Orlov touched on the possible consequences of  abolishing quotas and licenses in exporting oil. In his opinion,  the consequences of this act will probably turn out to be very  unfortunate for the geologists, who last year extracted about 3  million tonnes of oil and exported practically all of it. In  connection with the reduction in budgetary allocations of almost  90 percent, income from oil exports allowed the geologists only  to support social welfare activities. And, in recent years,  about 30 percent of all expenditures in geology have gone to  these. And, this in spite of the fact that the excise tax rate  for geologists was the very highest--24 percent. Taking into  account that geologists extract oil in absolutely uninhabited  places, where there are no pipelines and the extracted oil has  to be shipped in gasoline tankers and mainly on winter roads,  the imposition of a customs duty of 30 ECUs per tonne can  completely undermine the social welfare sphere. Thus, one of the  questions to be examined by the commission for operational  questions on 7 June will be the abolition of excise taxes. For  now, Viktor Orlov is not taking it upon himself to predict how  the question will be decided.    Work abroad on a commercial basis has become another avenue  for obtaining additional funds for geologists. At present, at  least 10 agreements have been concluded with countries in which  during the USSR era geological exploration work was conducted.  But, geologists then worked using state credits. The new  agreements create not only new working places, but also a base  for supplying Russia with economically useful minerals that are  now in short supply for the national economy. (A classic example  is bauxite, large reserves of which have not been found on  Russian territory for over 60 years.) For at least another 15  years, the country will import certain mineral raw materials.  And, even after that, imports of mineral raw materials could  increase.    In concluding the interview with the SEGODNYA correspondent,  Viktor Orlov pointed to the growing interest in mineral  resources on the part of all regimes. If success is reached in  resolving the nonpayments problem and in adopting the package of  documents talked about above, then the volume of geological  exploration work will achieve the optimal level, which will  constitute half of the most that was achieved in the 1980's.

0,FT922-5107 ,"FT922-5107 _AN-CFBA3AC9FT 920602   FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (3): A puzzle of fiendish complexity - Pollution of the atmospher / Predictions are fraught with uncertainty      By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor   THE THREE most serious pollution threats to the world's atmosphere are global warming, destruction of the ozone layer, and acid rain. Each would be a fiendishly complex scientific puzzle in its own right. In fact they interact - making it almost impossible even for the brightest research groups armed with the most powerful supercomputers to disentangle the effect of individual pollutants. For example, much of the industrialised world is cloaked in a man-made haze of sulphate aerosols - microscopically small droplets and particles that contribute to acid rain. But, according to the latest scientific evidence, this is moderating global warming because the particles reflect some incoming solar radiation back out to space. Scientists are not even sure about the effect of chlorofluorocarbons on climate change. CFCs are undisputed environmental villains because they destroy the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, which protects life on earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. They also contribute significantly to global warming by absorbing solar heat (infra-red radiation). So the international agreement to phase out CFC production will not only save the ozone layer but also help to fight the greenhouse effect. Right? Not necessarily. Recent studies show that the warming effect of CFCs over the past decade has been counterbalanced by their ozone destruction, because a thinner ozone layer traps less heat. The scientists concerned emphasise that their findings are tentative, and even if CFCs turn out to have no net impact on global warming, it is still vital to phase them out as soon as possible because life depends on the earth's ozone shield. The example does, however, illustrate the scientific uncertainties about global warming. There is no doubt that the greenhouse effect is real, in the sense that carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere absorb solar heat which would otherwise be radiated back into space. Human activities have increased the amount of CO in the atmosphere by about a quarter since 1850, mainly through burning fossil fuels and to a lesser extent through deforestation. According to the best estimates, CO represents about 55 per cent of total man-made additions to the greenhouse effect. Other significant contributors include CFCs, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. (Low-level ozone, formed in a photochemical smog as a result of vehicle emissions, is an environmental menace - ozone's proper place is in the upper atmosphere.) Scientists can show that greenhouse gases are accumulating in the atmosphere. What they cannot prove yet is that global warming is already happening as a result. Although the past decade has been the warmest worldwide since meteorologists began keeping reliable weather records in the 1850s - and the average global temperature has risen by 0.5 deg C over the last century - the current warmth could be due to a natural fluctuation in the climate, rather than the greenhouse effect. We may have to wait another 10 years before the effects of man-made change stand out unequivocally from random climatic variations. However, several different supercomputer models of the global climate predict a warming of several degrees over the next century, if industrial activities continue to change the composition of the atmosphere at the present rate. The average temperature is likely to rise by somewhere between 1.5 deg C and 4.5 deg C if the atmospheric concentration of CO doubles. That would raise sea levels by something between 30cm and 1m. The best estimate of the UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is that the average global temperature will rise by 1 deg C by the year 2025 and 3 deg C by 2100, if nothing is done to restrain CO emissions. Sea levels would rise by 6cm per decade - enough to inundate low-lying countries such as Bangladesh fairly early in the 21st century. These predictions are fraught with uncertainty, particularly since the supercomputer models, such as the one at the UK Meteorological Office are only now being adjusted to take realistic account of the key role played by clouds and oceans in climate change. Increasing cloud cover at low levels would reflect more solar radiation back into space and counteract global warming. 'The uncertainties are large and all-pervading,' comments Professor Keith Browning, a specialist on clouds at the Met Office. 'They severely limit the reliability of climate predictions.' And the latest evidence suggests that the oceans may absorb heat from the atmosphere more effectively than climatologists had realised previously. If so, they could delay the full impact of global warming by several decades. In Japan, Dr Hajime Akimoto, a director of the National Institute for Environmental Studies, says: 'The theory of global warming is quite correct. What we cannot predict is the speed at which it will happen.' If the climate change is uncertain on a global scale, the regional variations it will cause in temperature and rainfall are even more speculative. Some meteorologists believe the British Isles could be one of the few parts of the world to escape without any warming, because the exceptional pattern of ocean currents in the North Atlantic would absorb the extra heat. Conversely, continental interiors such as the great grain-growing regions of North America might suffer exceptional warming - with potentially dire consequences for world food supplies. All the uncertainties about climate change and other consequences of atmospheric pollution do not mean that the world should postpone measures to tackle them, scientists say. Most climatologists support vigorous international action to curb fossil fuel burning; to wait for proof of global warming would be too late. Meanwhile, a few imaginative scientists are dreaming up grand 'environmental engineering' projects to repair some of the damage done to the atmosphere. The best-known proposal is to seed the southern oceans with iron, a nutrient that would stimulate marine organisms to grow more vigorously and absorb more CO from the atmosphere. And a group at the University of California is investigating a concept to 'close the ozone hole' by injecting thousands of tons of alkanes (simple hydrocarbon gases such as ethane or propane) into the stratosphere over Antarctica for about a month every year. 'There are many uncertainties underlying this idea,' the California scientists admit, but they say the time has come to start thinking seriously about large-scale technical fixes for the environment.

God willing, may it be a year full  of success. Could you tell our listening friends what important  projects were implemented by the Petroleum Ministry in 1372  [year beginning 21 March 1993]?    [Aqazadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful.    I reciprocate new year's greetings to all our dear people  and  I hope that it will be a wonderful and constructive year for our  country and people, God willing. Regarding the last (?two)  years, we attained considerable success in 1372, which can be  presented in the form of a list:    --The exploration of the Darkhovin reserves, which has  approximately 9 billion barrels of very superior quality light  oil.    --The discovery of a new gas reserve with 20 trillion cubic  feet [as heard] of gas with very rich deposits.    --Regarding drilling, fortunately we have attained a  wonderful drilling record since the Revolution: 300,000 meters  on the nationally.    --In the field of crude oil production, we have raised  Iran's  production capacity to over 4 million barrels. The war caused  extensive damage to the crude oil production industry.  Fortunately, we were able to carry out repairs and  reconstruction and raise our production from 2.5 million barrels  at that time to 4 million.    --Regarding infrastructural projects, one of our most  remarkable achievements was the inauguration -- in the presence  of the esteemed president -- of the Arak Refinery with a  capacity of 150,000 barrels and of one of the greatest  petrochemical units of the country, namely the Arak  petrochemical complex with a capacity of approximately 250,000  petrochemicals, including light and heavy polyethylene, and  propylene.    --In the field of gas piping, in 1372 we were able to  install  250,000 gauges in the houses of the people, and by activating a  new phase of the Kangan Refinery we were able to raise its  output to more than 55 million cubic meters.    --Fortunately, we were successful in expanding our gas  piping  activities in various cities, and in 1372 200 cities had been  covered by piped gas or activities for expanding the gas piping  network had been initiated, which was a massive and valuable  project performed by the National Gas company.    --With all the deficiencies and shortcomings, it was an  appropriate performance compared to other years for the National  Distribution Company [NDC]. Fortunately, we did not experience  any fuel shortages in the colder areas of the country, such as  in East and West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Kermanshah, and Kordestan  Provinces. The situation was most satisfactory throughout the  country, compared to all the years since the Revolution. This  made it possible to have a very rare situation countrywide, and  except for some temporary shortages in some cities, the  situation was most satisfactory.    Fortunately, with the signatures of most of the deputies and  their appreciation of its services, the NDC was able to plan its  activities for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994] in such a  manner that we can resolve the problem of transporting fuel  permanently, God willing.    These activities are a brief account of our projects in  1372.  Regarding the sale of crude oil and our presence in  international markets, the situation in the first six months of  this year regarding prices and sales were favorable and in  accordance with what had been envisaged in the budget. However,  in the second half of the year, with a slump in oil prices, our  income decreased. In general, we had an oil income of $13.5  billion, which was $3 billion less than the forecasts. In view  of the situation in the international market, this level of  income was quite appropriate and we were able to adhere to the  production ceilings stipulated by OPEC, as well as to organize  our exports within that framework in an excellent manner without  any retail problems.    [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, could you tell us what  programs you envision for 1373? If, God willing, you have any  glad tidings for our compatriots, do let us know.    [Aqazadeh] I may state that since the development and  distribution of oil and gas, the expansion of the petrochemical  complexes is the priority of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We  are optimistic that new oil derricks that have been set up for  exploration in the Caspian Sea will become operational next  year. In addition, we will begin drilling wells in the eastern  Mazandaran Sea region, which is one of the most suitable sites  in the country, even though it has not been explored in the past  years.    Our prospecting activities will continue in the Persian Gulf  and [words indistinct] fortunately, we have decided that the  planning and construction of this refinery will be done  completely by Iranians. This work will begin in 1373 and it is  hoped it will be operational in 1375 [year beginning 21 March  1996].    A very important piece of news for our people is the  value-added [arzesh-afzudeh] importance of this unit, as well as  the magnitude of the production of the vast Bandar-e Imam  complex. The glad tidings I have for the people are that this  massive complex, which is the largest petrochemical production  unit in our country and covers all branches, such as light and  heavy polyethylene, propylene, EDC, PVC [preceding acronyms in  English], as well as all other petrochemical products, is  expected to begin full operation in Khordad [22 May-21 June]  this year.    With these complexes going into operation, we will not only  be able to attain self-sufficiency in most petrochemical  departments but will also be able to export $300 million worth  of these products this year. This is also good news for the  factories that provide the raw materials for the petrochemical  complexes, and they should not have any doubts regarding the  sale of their products because we will ensure high-quality  production at an international standard and will thus  permanently eliminate the problems that they have experienced  for so many years regarding petrochemical imports and  fluctuations in foreign exchange income.    On the gas piping situation, as in the past years, we will  expand these activities in various cities of the country, which  is our priority. We hope that this year more cities in the  colder areas of our country will join the gas piping network.    With the functioning of the Sarkhun Refinery in Bandar-e  'Abbas, which has a capacity of approximately 15 million cubic  meters of gas per day, we will be able to cater to the needs of  the Hormozgan, especially of the Kerman Province, its power  station, the peripheral copper industries, the Sarcheshmeh  copper complex, and the cities on this route right up to Kerman.  This will open a new chapter in the piping of gas. With the  development of the refinery and its operation, especially of the  (Karkehraker) unit in Abadan that distills furnace oil and its  products such as gasoline, gas oil, and kerosene, we are  extremely optimistic that 1373 will be a wonderful year for our  people regarding the provision of their fuel product  requirements.    I predict that in the oil industry 1373 will be a grand year  for production, foreign exchange earnings, and the increase in  the efficiency of this great industry of the country. Once  again, I wish to convey my greetings for this new year to the  people, especially to my colleagues in the petroleum industry  who have behind them a successful year, and I hope that this  year they will make the same sublime efforts so that the country  is steered toward economic and political self-sufficiency.    [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, I am extremely grateful that  you have given some of your time for us, despite your  engagements. We hope you will be successful and that in the  course of the year 1373 we will be able to be at your service  again.    [Aqazadeh] Likewise, I am grateful for your efforts and  those of your colleagues at the radio [station] for preparing  and presenting such joyful, wonderful, and useful programs.    [Correspondent] May you be successful, God willing.     "

0,FT933-4283 ,"FT933-4283 _AN-DIIB8AE5FT 930909   FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: 'Patchy' markets leave Ocean static at Pounds 20.8m - Particularly bad conditions in continental Europe      By DAVID BLACKWELL   OCEAN GROUP, the freight, environmental and marine services combine which underwent an Pounds 8m streamlining of its management structure last year, has announced unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.8m for the first half of 1993. That followed a 20 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 789.1m (Pounds 653.4m). Earnings per share and the interim dividend were also unchanged at 9.4p and 4.71p respectively. Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the results were consistent with the group's plans. He described its markets as 'patchy,' with particularly bad conditions in continental Europe. The group was not expecting any help from the world economy this year. Operating profits rose to Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 23.6m) and included Pounds 700,000 from Panocean, whose overseas activities were sold to Royal Pakhoed in March for Pounds 55m including debt. Panocean also contributed Pounds 6.4m to turnover. Net interest payments were Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.8m), reflecting a Pounds 12m increase in net debt to Pounds 63m and the reduction in UK interest returns from the group's Pounds 33m worth of sterling deposits. However, gearing was down from 35 per cent at December 31 to just over 20 per cent following the Panocean disposal. Pre-tax profit included a Pounds 2m benefit from exchange gains, countered by increased costs on the computer system being installed at MSAS, the international freight business. Freight and distribution services, which operate on very fine margins, boosted turnover by just over 25 per cent to Pounds 682.7m for the half, although its operating profit eased from Pounds 8m to Pounds 7.8m. The group expected to see the benefits from its new computer system next year. Marine services contributed the bulk of the profits, with Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 12.6m) from a turnover up 9 per cent at Pounds 63.8m. Mr Barber said the group had moved its oil exploration vessels away from the depressed North Sea to areas of strength in West Africa and south-east Asia. Cory Towage had a good first half and benefited from favourable trading in a number of its markets and from salvage revenue. Results at OIL showed an improvement over last year. Operating profit from the environmental services division was Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.6m) on turnover of Pounds 35.2m (Pounds 32.8m). COMMENT Rarely can a flatter first half have been announced. The company says it is satisfied with its progress since last year's reorganisation, which shed nearly 500 jobs and is expected to reap a full benefit of Pounds 5m by the year end after Pounds 1.5m in the first half. These savings are likely to account for the rise in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 44m, from Pounds 38.1m last year. But the picture is not so rosy if currency gains of Pounds 4m to Pounds 5m are added into the equation. However, the outlook brightens next year, when the benefits of the freight distribution business's new computer system should start to feed through and the Pounds 18m Barcelona distribution centre announced in July comes on stream. Meanwhile the shares are worth holding for their 5 1/2 per cent yield.   Companies:-  Ocean Group.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

It is the main hardship of the so-called special period  in the aftermath of the sudden fall of eastern European  socialism, particularly the fall of socialism in the former  Soviet Union. This lack of oil has had a widespread effect on  all types of transportation services, because Cuba has largely  relied on automotive transportation, which requires not only  fuel, but also lubricants and other important products.    The sugar industry, the most important industry in Cuba,  which is the world's largest sugar exporter, cannot run without  petroleum. However, many sugar refineries are using bagasse as  the main source of fuel for their boilers.    In addition, the country's electrical industry also needs  hydrocarbons to generate energy. Cuba, a small country that  lacks large rivers and waterfalls needed to build hydroelectric  plants, has only two alternatives: thermoelectrical plants,  which also need oil, and nuclear plants. The construction of  the nuclear plant in Juragua, in the central region, was halted  when it was almost finished, because the mighty Soviet state,  which was helping Cuba build its first nuclear plant, suddenly  disappeared. Thus, the Cuban Government is feverishly  negotiating with other countries to complete this project vital  to the national economy. This lack of electricity introduced a  new predicament to the Cuban population, which is exposed to  daily power outages that last several hours, usually at times  when it is most needed.    These brief examples allow us to visualize the problems the  Cuban nation is currently facing, because the world's largest  power is economically blocking and harassing it to subjugate the  political resolve of the Cuban population. Cuba, along with  several European and American countries, has given oil  exploration a large impetus. Cuba has also been able to  significantly increase national crude production since 1959,  when the revolution succeeded.    Oil production is expected to amount to 1.3 million tons  this  year and will continue to grow in the future. Large amounts of  this oil used to generate electricity are too heavy and require  special treatment to reduce the number of breakdowns in the  industry's already worn-out equipment.    Cuba also signed an important agreement with Russia to  exchange 2.5 million tons of oil for 1 million tons of sugar  this year. In addition, a joint operation with Mexico is  already under way to jump start the Cienfuegos oil refinery,  part of whose output will be bought by and consumed in that  country.    After the incident of an alleged meeting that Colombian  guerrillas held in Havana, which jeopardized the recently  established relations between the two countries, there is a  possibility that Colombia will sell some 120,000 barrels of  crude oil daily to Cuba within the framework of a transaction  exclusively regulated by international trade guidelines. Other  efforts are already under way but have yet to materialize. It  is expected that the Cuban economy will experience some kind of  relief this year and will begin surmounting the crisis caused by  the latest political upheavals.     "
0,FT932-12073 ,"FT932-12073 _AN-DD3B1AAMFT 930430   FT  30 APR 93 / Norway's PM in warning on EC entry: David Gardner interviews Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland on the fishing demand Brussels may not grant      By DAVID GARDNER   NORWAY'S determination to retain exclusive right to its rich fishery resources could prevent it from joining the European Community, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, warned yesterday. This confirmed fears that Norway's application for membership will be the toughest to negotiate in the current talks on enlarging the EC. 'On the issue of fish we are talking about a vital issue, something which left Norway outside European co-operation in 1972 and could so so again,' Mrs Brundtland said in an interview. Norwegian voters rejected EC membership in 1972, when the UK, Denmark and Ireland joined the Community. Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway are all negotiating to join the EC. Polls this month show Norwegian opinion running 53 per cent against EC membership, with 36 per cent for and 11 per cent undecided. Mrs Brundtland's minority Labour government is plummeting in the polls ahead of a general election in September which will be dominated by the EC membership debate. The right-of-centre coalition she replaced in November 1990 was brought down by internal differences over Europe. Mr Jan Henry Olsen, Norway's fisheries minister, said in a separate interview that Norwegians 'have no fish to give away'. He said Oslo had already given away too much through restricted fishing rights in Norwegian waters conceded to EC countries when Norway joined the European Economic Area (EEA), set up between the EC and European Free Trade Association countries. Norway's Storting (parliament) was expected to ratify the EEA treaty last night. 'If the EC asks for more quotas it could stop Norway joining the Community,' Mr Olsen said bluntly. The 200-mile limit around Norway's coast is 'our arable land', he added. Mrs Brundtland supported Mr Olsen's hard line, saying: 'Norway was squeezed sufficiently over the EEA treaty and you cannot repeat that. He is not alone in his evaluation.' The fisheries issue alone is certain to spark hostility from fishing nations like Spain, which wants access to Norwegian waters in compensation for unimpeded access for Norway's fish products in the EC single market. But Norway's insistence on reserving half of all exploration rights to its rich oil and gas reserves for its state oil company Statoil, is another point of friction. Draft legislation being prepared by Brussels would outlaw this preference as discriminatory. Oslo will insist the draft directive is shelved until Norway enters the EC, senior officials say. Unlike its fellow applicants which hoped to conclude entry negotiations this year, hold referendums next year, and accede to the EC in 1995, Norway is resigned to a long haul, probably extending well into next year. Although Norway's hardline negotiating tactics have caused dismay in Brussels and provoked the hostility of member states like Spain and the Benelux countries, Mrs Brundtland feels it is better to get the difficulties of Norwegian membership out in the open from the start. For the government to have any chance of winning over the electorate requires 'clear answers around the negotiating questions which have been raised,' she added.

Jiang Chunyun,  secretary of the provincial party committee, emphasized at the  conference the need to seize the opportunity to deepen reform,  face up to challenges, maintain the good development trend of  township enterprises, concentrate efforts to upgrade their  quality and level to a new height, and make township  enterprises, a new force, come to the fore for the second time.    Attending the conference were Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary  of the provincial party committee and provincial governor; Li  Chunting, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and  provincial vice governor; Chen Jianguo, standing committee  member of the provincial party committee and provincial vice  governor; and responsible persons of pertinent provincial  departments.    Shandong's township enterprises continued to maintain the  trend of robust development and created 482.5 billion yuan in  output value last year. The industrial output value they  created was 359.3 billion yuan, accounting for more than 60  percent of Shandong's total.    Jiang Chunyun said: Shandong's township enterprises  registered the fastest and best development rate last year.  Compared with advanced provinces and municipalities, however,  we still lag rather far behind in many aspects. We should  remain clear-headed to note that the endeavor to accelerate  establishment of the socialist market economy system not only  provides a good opportunity and opens up a vast world for  township enterprise development but also brings new challenges.  All localities should continue to regard township enterprise  development as the strategic priority of Shandong's economic  development, add impetus to reform, and make township  enterprises more vigorous in development. In the reform of  township enterprises, we should greatly extend the shareholding  system in compliance with the requirement for establishing the  socialist market economy system; bring property right relations  into better balance; achieve success in the merge and  cooperation between the enterprises of different ownerships and  trades; promote lease, merge, and auction; and do a good job in  the organization and management of enterprise groups. In  deepening the reform of township enterprises, we should put it  in the most important place to emancipate the mind, seek truth  from facts, and change ideas; embrace as soon as possible the  new concepts and new ideas compatible with the socialist market  economy; be brave in exploration and active in pioneering; and  create a new advantage and new pattern of township enterprises  by deepening reform.    Jiang Chunyun emphasized: We should further clarify the  guiding thought and truly shift the work focus of township  enterprises to the improvement of economic efficiency. We  should pay close attention to weak links to facilitate township  enterprises' development of the export-oriented economy and the  tertiary industry. We should further improve the investment  climate, attract foreign funds, and develop the three types of  foreign-funded enterprises. Geared to the world market, we  should broaden our field of vision, make friends with others  extensively, and bring in projects and capital from abroad. We  should adopt preferential policies and feasible measures to  encourage and guide more enterprises to establish plants and  offices outside the country and outside the province in order to  directly participate in the competition of the world and  domestic markets.

This year Cerro, located 2,600 metres above sea level in the Atacama desert 120kms east of the port of Iquique, will produce 40m lbs of copper. Next year output rises to 90m lbs. Mr Colin Macaulay, president, said in London yesterday that Cerro was built with expansion in mind and by 1996, by spending only another USDollars 50m, Rio would lift annual output by half from the present design capacity to more than 130m lbs. He said: 'We could not have brought Cerro into production at a better time' because all the indications were that copper prices would remain reasonably high for the next two years. However, Rio was primarily focused on keeping production costs down well below the industry average and Cerro, by using the low-cost solvent-extraction, electro-winning (SX-EW) technology, would produce cathode copper for about 53 cents a lb until the expansion was completed when costs would fall to about 50 cents. Rio is one of the mining industry's most consistent profit makers but its main source of income until recently came from the Elliot Lake, Ontario, uranium mines. Before Cerro started production, all of Rio's copper - 116m lbs last year - came from a one-third stake in Highland Valley Copper of British Columbia. Highland's cash costs for cathode copper are about 62 cents a lb. Rio first took an option on Cerro from a Japanese exploration group in the early 1980s and intended to develop a mine in partnership with Outokumpu of Finland. But the copper price plummeted and Outokumpu's unions objected to it operating in a country which then was a right-wing dictatorship. 'That was fortunate because then the new SX-EW technology came along which doubled the size of the reserves, is much cheaper and cleaner,' Mr Macaulay said. RTZ, the world's biggest mining company which once controlled Rio, also had designs on Cerro. But when RTZ sold to the public its 51 per cent stake two years ago because of growing conflicts of interest, 'it could not find a legal way to take it away from us,' said Mr Macaulay. The impact of Cerro on Rio can be judged by the company's sensitivity to the copper price - it does no forward selling or hedging but all production is pre-sold to Japanese and German customers on terms based on the market rate. At present a 10 US cents a lb change in the price affects Rio's earnings by 19 cents a share. This will increase to 31 cents a share in 1995 and to 38 cents in 1996 after the expansion. Mr Macaulay said Rio was exploring for more copper in Chile and, like most other copper producers, was talking to Codelco, the state-owned group there, about possible joint ventures or taking over some properties. But this was a slow process because it was politically difficult for the Codelco management and the Chilean government which faced strong union opposition to such moves.   Companies:-  Rio Algom.

The breach became evident at the start of the year when Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan formed their own economic union and gained momentum this week when Kyrgyzstan joined the breakaway grouping, representing open antagonism from a region which had previously valued close ties with Moscow and even opposed the Soviet break-up. The new distaste for and worry about Moscow follow increasingly vocal demands from Russia for part of the wealth in the resource-rich Caucasus and Central Asia, particularly giant oil and natural gas deals under negotiation in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. The demands for percentages and equity holdings in exploration and extraction contracts have been echoed by Russian nationalists such as Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky who insist on reclaiming the empire and the spoils that go with it. In loosening ties with Moscow, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have also moved away from their two Central Asian neighbours, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, both of which have elected to remain as either economic or political satellites. Tajikistan has handed over supervision of both its security and economy to Moscow, while Turkmenistan is pursuing a course of appeasement with Moscow. Kazakhstan, which has the second-largest oil reserves in the former Soviet Union, including two of the world's 10 largest oil fields, has recently altered the tone of its statements on Russia to almost open hostility. Despite Kazakhstan's vulnerability to its northern neighbour, with an ethnic Russian population of 38 per cent, the republic's state secretary, Mr Tulebek Zhukeev, has taken the risky step of publicly denouncing Moscow's 'imperial ambitions'. Mr Zhukeev recently announced his government would charge Russia Dollars 7bn in annual rent for the Baykanur space station and two military test sites. Demonstrating the sentiment behind the pricey demands, Mr Zhukeev declared: 'This will bankrupt Russia.' The Kazakh government has reason to be upset with Russia. While demanding Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 803m) in 1993 debts to Russian state enterprises, Moscow has not paid for huge coal shipments from Kazakhstan's Karagan region. At the same time, raw material shipments from Russia have become unreliable. The Central Asian economic union is meant to co-ordinate economic, monetary and labour policy. It would create a region larger than western Europe, with a combined population of 48m but possessing as much oil and mineral wealth as some leading Gulf states. The grouping will abolish customs procedures and tariffs and co-operate on economic policies. It aims to encourage growth of trade between members. Another motive, however, is to erect a front-line defence against Moscow's growing political demands, including one that ethnic Russian citizens in Central Asia be granted dual nationality, a demand rejected by Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan as an unacceptable infringement of their sovereignty. In short, the Kazakh and Uzbek leaderships want Moscow to back off. This may not be accomplished, said a senior diplomat in Tashkent, but at the least 'the union makes it easier to deal with Russia both economically and politically'.

A public accountant by training and nature, he had never worked for an oil company, or in the higher levels of the private sector, or held elective office, when he was appointed head of Pemex in February 1987. He had spent practically all his working life supervising government spending in the budget and finance ministries. But it was precisely the qualities of a politically loyal, tight-fisted bureaucrat that endeared him to the then president, Mr Miguel de la Madrid, and subsequently to his successor, Mr Carlos Salinas. Pemex, and its union, had a well-deserved reputation for woeful inefficiency, corruption, and over-manning. Mr Rojas was under orders to cut out the fat. That is just what he has done. The Pemex union has been destroyed, and from being one of the most powerful in Mexico, is now probably the weakest. The collective labour contract has been re-written, giving management carte blanche to do as it likes. Mr Rojas expects to have slashed the workforce to 125,000 this year, from 210,000 workers in 1987. The company, which explores, produces, refines, and sells oil, gas and petrochemicals, reckons it has cut operating costs by some 20 per cent since 1986. At same time, oil production is around 2.67m barrels a day, up from 2.51m b/d in 1987, while refining capacity has increased. With labour reforms under his belt, Mr Rojas is now concentrating on the restructuring of Pemex into a corporate holding company and four subsidiaries - exploration and production, refining, gas and basic petrochemicals and petrochemicals. While formally announced a few months ago, the restructuring is the culmination of a long-term (and arguably unachievable) plan: to turn Pemex into a profitable, international oil company, without admitting competition on to its home turf. 'The fundamental philosophy' says Mr Rojas 'is the management of all operations under commercial and international terms . . . We have developed a system of prices that we are going to apply across all inter-company contracts.' Under the new system, cross-subsidies between subsidiaries will be removed, and thus the performance of each subsidiary can be easily evaluated. While a system of transfer prices has been tried before, Mr Rojas says it will now be easier. 'Before we had to have a system of transfer prices that was unreal, detached, separated from real accounting of transactions between divisions; today we have companies and commercial prices. That is one, that is a huge difference we are dealing with.' Each division will have to publish its results separately, which will be compared with those of international companies. Mr Rojas suggests that eventually investment in a division will depend on its profitability, and thus on the probable return on capital. Pemex will start this strategy with the petrochemicals division (the only one open to the private sector). Petrochemical plants that are not profitable will be closed, or sold off; those that are, may receive capital. In this way the efficient parts (by international standards) of Pemex could grow, and the inefficient parts be left to fold. An incentive to be competitive would have been established. The restructuring is above all intended to force Pemex middle management to change its way of thinking. In the past, says Mr Rojas, 'there was no criteria of the maximisation of profits, there was no business criteria in the activities of Pemex. What they demanded of Pemex was that it supply effectively all the hydrocarbon needs of the nation and there is no doubt it did it. No doubt. 'Now we have changed. We not only want supplies, but we want international supplies at international competitive prices. Thus we need not only to be effective, but efficient. This is the change in which we are emerged . . . not only thinking how to do things in engineering terms but how engineering things are profitable in business terms.' Of course as long as Pemex remains a monopoly, efficient business-like parts of the company would have to continue relying on the inefficient parts of the chain for providing basic services. In part to overcome this weakness, Mr Rojas is at the same time forcing Pemex to contract out more and more work to domestic and foreign drilling and construction firms. A host of foreign firms are drilling for oil or building platforms for cash (not prohibited by the constitution); others are bidding to build refineries. Eventually - although Mr Rojas was even vaguer than usual on this - subsidiaries of Pemex might have to compete against private-sector companies to win the business of another arm of Pemex. If so, the Pemex monopoly in effect would have crumbled. While industry observers of Pemex tend to applaud such declarations of Mr Rojas, many remain sceptical. Mr Rojas fought tooth and nail against Mexico's trade ministry to avoid making oil concessions to the US in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Unlike many members of Mexico's government, he appears to be a true believer in the merits of a national, state oil industry. Mr Rojas thus appointed a member of the old guard at Pemex to run exploration and production, the most important division. Mr Rojas remains head of the board of each of the four divisions of Pemex, belying the decentralisation of power the new regime is supposed to encourage. The Pemex holding company will continue to allocate resources, evaluate results, and set company strategy for its four subsidiaries. But Mr Rojas is like all Mexican government officials above all a loyal servant to his president. His given role is to restructure rather than dismantle Pemex, and cut its costs. And in that job, narrow as it may be, he is usually given high marks.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

Michael Thompson-Noel surveys the latest holiday options      By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL   A SHORT while ago I spent a bleak weekend in Vilnius, Lithuania. There is almost nothing to see or do in Vilnius, except go to church, scuttle in search of restaurants - and marvel at the bankruptcy to which the Evil Empire drove its vassal republics before history gave it the heave-ho. So far as I could see, the Lithuanians make nothing, own nothing, and have almost nothing to do. Despite this, they are trying to be cheerful. Here, for example, is an extract from a release put out by Lithuanian Tours, one of the first private travel companies in the country, which is establishing relations with foreign tour operators: 'If you long for wild nature, green forests full of singing birds, swift and clean brooks, golden sand dunes and refreshing sea breeze, you should come to Lithuania . . . It is here that organ, chamber and symphonic music is still highly admired and people gather in concert halls solemnly concentrated and dressed for the occasion. It is here that the Church mass is still held with ancient dignity harmoniously matching elegant, monumental and ornated church architecture.' It will be many years, I fear, before Lithuania makes its mark in the cut-throat world of international tourism. But for those with ancestral connections, or who like to visit places that are 'new' and 'different,' things are starting to stir. Just before Christmas, Instone Travel, London-based, launched a brochure featuring Russia and the republics. 'Russia,' claims Des McGuinness, Instone's managing director, 'offers one of the most exciting and stimulating travel experiences available today. Our new tour programmes reflect and exploit fully the greater freedom and flexibility now to be found in Russia and the republics.' Instone is offering 14-night tours of the Baltic republics, starting in St Petersburg and taking in Tallinn (Estonia), Riga (Latvia) and Vilnius, then Moscow. The all-in price (travel, hotels, meals and guide) starts from Pounds 839 per person for the April 26 departure. Other offerings: four-, seven- and 13-night visits to St Petersburg, Moscow and central Asia, or a trip on the trans-Siberian railway (starting price for 14 nights: Pounds 999). Among the vast array of cruise company brochures, one that catches the eye is Cunard's first Great Rivers of Europe programme, which offers a variety of cruises on the Rhone, Elbe and Danube on purpose-built craft. Example: a 10-day cruise on the Danube Princess from Passau (Germany) downstream to Constanta on the Black Sea, calling at Durnstein, Vienna, Budapest, Kalocsa and Mohacs (Hungary), Belgrade, Turno-Severin (Romania), and Russe (Bulgaria). Prices for seven-day cruises start at Pounds 880, including flights between the UK and Passau or Constanta. A number of cheap and cheerful do-it-yourself holidays is available in the French Country Cruises brochure of Andrew Brock Travel, which says that hire costs of a four-berth boat start at Pounds 446 per week in low season, while a 12-berth boat in peak season costs Pounds 2,286. The brochure details 16 bases for cruising on French canals; the reintroduction of a base in Holland (Loosdrecht, south of Amsterdam), and the start-up of boating holidays in eastern Germany, on the 'waterway wonderland' of lakes and canals in the Mecklenburg and Brandenburg regions. 'The well-maintained locks are rare,' says Brock, 'commercial traffic rarer still, and in the hot central European summers, bathing is a matter of tying up to a tree and plunging into the lake. Now is the time to see it all, before the Russian troops and the Trabants are gone for ever.' A brochure devoted to sea voyages by passenger-cargo vessel can be had from Gdynia America Shipping Lines (London), while the 1993 brochure from Clipper, which organises natural history and cultural cruises, includes several new itineraries. Examples: Antarctica and the Chilean Fjords, Bridging the Bering Strait, and Treasures of Western South America. If you want to go north, study the brochure of Arctic Experience, which specialises in tours to Iceland, Greenland, Spitsbergen, Norway, Finland, Lapland, Canada and Alaska. Its Images of Finland holiday, for example, ranges from the lakes of the south to the high fells of Lapland, and includes two nights in St Petersburg. Short-stay holidays have had plenty of attention in recent years. A useful brochure (because of its brevity) is the Romantic Escapes programme of Made to Measure Holidays, featuring - or so it says - 'some of Europe's finest hotels as well as some less rossetted properties which offer great charm and great food.' It covers obvious attractions like Paris, Venice, Florence and Berlin, but also less rossetted spots such as Annecy, Sintra and Durnstein. The cross-Channel ferry companies are reasonably big holiday operators in their own right. Brittany Ferries, for example, has a series of brochures, including Holiday Homes In France (more than 400 British-owned properties for rent), Holidays and Breaks in France and Spain, and Gite Holidays in France. One of the best of all British travel companies is Cox and Kings, run by the energetic Peter Kerkar. It is probably best known for its Indian and environmental programmes, but is at present devoting a lot of time to South America. In addition to group tours and suggested itineraries for independent travellers, the company's Latin American brochure has a third, themed section divided into five categories: beaches, cruises, rail, and country and city tours. Cuba features in the brochure, alongside Mexico, Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, Argentine, Chile, Belize, Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Bolivia, the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador and Patagonia. A company for which I have a great deal of time is Meon Villa Holidays, which offers top-quality villas in popular European centres. It started out, 25 years ago, by offer ing 30 villas on the Algarve, and now offers 500 villas and apartments in 16 places. Last autumn Meon fixed me up with a villa in northern Majorca. I took my executive assistant and her mother. Everything worked impeccably. Meon's formula - flights, properties with private pools, maids and car hire - and its service, are exemplary. This year, Meon is offering a wider range of properties in Florida and says that overall, many prices in its brochure are lower than in 1991-92. Flights  -daytime weekday whenever possible - are from Gatwick, as well as (depending on destination) Birmingham, Bristol, Heathrow, Luton, Manchester, Stansted and Glasgow. Telephone help is available from Meon staff. Other useful self-catering brochures are those of Classic Cottages (west of England, though it is now seeking French properties); Something Special Travel's Florida Villa Experience, and French Affair, which manages quality rural properties in the Dordogne, Lot Valley, Gasgony, Provence and Languedoc-Roussillon. Its sister company is Corsican Affair. High Places is an independent mountain travel company in its seventh year. New itineraries for 1993 include: Peaks of Ecuador (22 days, Pounds 1,880), Madagascar by Bike and Boat (24 days, Pounds 2,460) and A Trek to Spiti, a newly-opened Buddhist kingdom (24 days, Pounds 1,630). For culture vultures, a useful programme is that of Specialtours, under the wing of the National Art Collections Fund. You need to be a fund member, although non-members can book provided they take out a year's membership, which costs Pounds 15, before departure. Specialtours says it has more than 20 years' experience in arranging cultural tours, and has contacts among curators and collectors, in Europe and the US. Its 1993 tours include A Journey Through Syria, Art in California and Treasures of Berlin and Dresden.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Placer Domer U.S. has submitted to the Ely BLM District Office a Plan of Operations (POO). The POO describes proposed mining operations, including required access, for an area in White Pine County approximately 60 miles northwest of Ely, Nevada. The Buck and Bald Mining District has been active since 1984 with mineral exploration of the area and open pit/heap leach gold mining. There are currently six separate mining operations and five are operated by Placer Domer U.S. The other is Western State's White Pine Gold Mine at the northern end of the mining district. Placer Dome U.S. is proposing to expand their operation at Bald Mountain Mine by opening the Sage flats area and by establishing a new processing plant and heap/tailings facility. The Sage Flat area would be mined and ore transported to Placer Dome's current heap leach facility at the Bald Mountain Mine. The new heap/tailing facility operation would process 2.5 million tons per year and would consist of a new crushing facilities and tailing disposal area. The company also proposes to open a new open pit mine and heap leach facility in the Mooney Basin. This operation would consist of seven pits and would mine ore at a rate of 1.5 million tons per year. These modifications to the mine plan and new mine operations would allow Placer Dome U.S. to operate for seven more years.        The issues expected to be analyzed in the EIS are impacts to: Surface and groundwater, threatened and endangered species, cultural resources, wildlife, wild horses and mine reclamation. Cumulative impacts for the mining district will be analyzed in detail and will cover the complete mining district.           Dated: May 4, 1994.         Thomas V.

0,FT943-166 ,"FT943-166 _AN-EI3DUAEHFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / British Gas strategic review upbeat about dividend rises      By ROBERT CORZINE   British Gas yesterday predicted that a strong underlying performance in its main UK businesses would enable it to increase future dividends. In a rare public review of the company's strategy, senior executives told analysts in London that a progressive dividend policy could be maintained as long there were no more 'regulatory shocks'. Its shares, however, closed 9 1/2 p lower yesterday at 290p. The upbeat assessment of financial prospects contrasted sharply with two dividend warnings British Gas issued earlier this year. Analysts said those warnings were part of the company's negotiating tactics with the government and Ofgas, its regulator, over the planned liberalisation of the domestic gas market beginning in 1996. Mr Richard Giordano, chairman, said the 'dense regulatory fog' which had enveloped the company and resulted in a 'strategic paralysis' was beginning to lift. British Gas was now confident enough to lay out a coherent way forward for the rest of the decade. This was in spite of the fact that the government has yet to decide whether to bring forward legislation this year to open the domestic market. The short-term financial performance would be underpinned by expected improvements in the UK gas business, where Pounds 600m of costs would be removed by 1998 through a radical restructuring in which 25,000 jobs would go. The reforms were running ahead of schedule, according to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, who emphasised there were no 'sacred cows' within British Gas, and that business units which failed to return adequate shareholder value could be sold. A sharp rise in natural gas production from existing offshore reserves in the UK would account for most of the expected growth of cash flow to the year 2000, he said. UK businesses were also expected to receive the lion's share of Pounds 10bn of capital expenditure planned over the next five years. TransCo, the gas transportation and storage business, will absorb 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the total, while the UK exploration and production business would receive about 25 per cent. But the maturity of the UK continental shelf and the domestic gas market meant that long-term earnings growth would have to come from British Gas's international ventures. These would account for 25 per cent to 30 per cent of capital spending to 1999, but they would remain cash negative until the next decade. Mr Brown said the international strategy would be focused on regions where there was growing demand for gas, such as Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe. It would also be 'market driven,' and would involve British Gas forming a number of associate companies with strong local partners. That change in structure was one of the main reasons for the announcement yesterday that British Gas was replacing its earnings-based dividend policy with one based on cash flows. Over the next few years, profits from associated companies are likely to be re-invested, rather than returned in dividends. 'To take full credit for those profits in setting financial policy seems imprudent,' said Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director. The cash-based system would ensure that only actual cash receipts are taken into account. 'It will more accurately reflect the changing shape and risk profile of British Gas and remove any accounting distortions,' he added. Lex, Page 20 London stocks, Page 40   Companies:-  British Gas.

0,FT923-4966 ,"FT923-4966 _AN-CIEAPAEPFT 920903   FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Bombay makes tentative recovery from scandal - Government economic measures could help Indian share prices to rise further      By RC MURTHY   Indian bourses, enjoying their first rally for three months, are awaiting measures from the PV Narasimha Rao administration which, they hope, will stimulate the economy and boost equity values that have languished since a securities scandal broke early in May. New Delhi plans to make the rupee fully convertible, lower interest rates if prices continue to drop, relax controls on the pharmaceutical industry, and announce contracts with international oil companies for oil exploration and production. Most of these decisions are expected to be in place before Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, reviews India's programmes with the International Monetary Fund in Washington in three weeks' time. The 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), India's largest with two-thirds of national trading, is looking back at a slump which took it as low as 2,529 in early August, down 1,938 points, or 43 per cent, from a peak of 4,467 in mid-April, prompted by the seizure of assets of Mr Harshad Mehta and other brokers implicated in the Rs35bn (Dollars 1.25bn) securities scandal. After hitting a six-month low on August 6, share prices have rebounded since then, partly in response to government decontrol of chemical fertiliser prices and as bear operators covered their positions. Gujarat State Fertilisers have gained Rs60 to Rs340 and Zuari Agro Chem are Rs90 better at Rs390. Turnover, which had contracted from Rs3bn a day seen in April to less than Rs400m four months later, recovered to Rs1.72bn by last weekend as institutions and mutual funds bought at lower levels. The market appears to have found its level, for now. Share values moved in a narrow range last week and the 30-share index, at 3,031 last Friday, was around the same level as a week earlier. Yesterday the index closed at 3,040.57, down 29.92. Mr MR Mayya, executive director of the BSE, says the market is healthier now. Selling pressure has eased and the authorities have removed all restrictions on sales. But individual investors have yet to return in force, deterred by the forthcoming rush of rights issues, following the scrapping of capital issues control last month. Some Rs50bn worth of rights issues are scheduled over the next two months. Analysts say, however, that strong fundamentals and the government measures should lift share prices further over the next three weeks. Furthermore, the monsoon rains have been evenly spread throughout the country, improving crop prospects. The question is whether police and income tax authority raids on brokers and finance companies associated with the securities scandal will hamper the market's recovery. A parliamentary committee was set up two weeks ago to inquire into the scandal and the police and income tax authorities may have to co-ordinate with it in the future.

It is that vision -- of mankind planted safely beyond the pale of earthly  limitations -- that has kept the two plant scientists firm in their commitment  to space agriculture despite tight funding and the knowledge that they may not  live to see their research implemented.    ""It's long-range research that really has to be done now to be used later,""  said Bugbee, 38, the principal researcher for the university's controlled  ecological life-support system project.    ""And it's just plain interesting,"" he added. ""Something as complex as a closed  life-support system is just fascinating. We're trying to duplicate all the  functions of planet Earth in a relatively small capsule.""    Bugbee and Salisbury, 62, who serves on the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration's aerospace medical advisory committee, say it could be 30 years  or more before a permanent human colony is established on the moon and another  decade beyond that before Mars is settled.    Nonetheless, they believe that their work will survive them.    ""I don't think we can seriously talk about a permanent colony on the moon or  Mars without talking about (the life-support project),"" Salisbury said.    Plants raised under hydroponics are grown in nutrient-rich solutions rather  than soil.    Although funding for the hydroponic project -- about $130,000 a year since it  was approved by NASA in 1981 -- is minuscule compared with the billions spent  on the nation's manned space flight program, Salisbury and Bugbee point with  pride to its accomplishments.    Simulating as closely as possible the conditions of a lunar or Martian colonial  farm through variations in lighting and atmosphere, the project has grown a  Mexican dwarf variety of wheat with yields of 60 grams of edible wheat per  square yard per day.    That is five times the estimated world record of 12 to 14 grams, Salisbury  said.    Salisbury and Bugbee, believing that they are near the theoretical production  limits for wheat in an extraterrestrial colony setting, say they will next turn  their attention to wheat's performance in zero gravity -- a crucial  consideration for the day when mankind embarks on space voyages too long to be  sustained by stored food.    To that end, they are preparing an experiment for a future space shuttle  mission. NASA has approved the project, but it has yet to be scheduled for  flight, the two said in telephone interviews from the school's campus in Logan,  60 miles north of Salt Lake City.      Food and Pure Air    Salisbury and Bugbee say a space farm could feed the Mars mission's crew and  purify air and water supplies. For example, a 13-square-yard space farm could  feed one person indefinitely.    Looking beyond exploration to colonization of the moon and Mars, the  researchers believe that a farm about the size of a football field could  provide the food and oxygen needs of 100 or more people.    A hydroponic space farm, unlike those on Earth, would not be maintained as one  huge unit but would be made up of a number of self-contained compartments to  guard against the spread of plant diseases. Further, it probably would produce  far more food than needed, ranging from 20% to 100% more, as a hedge against  unexpected losses.

Salisbury and Bugbee, believing that they are near the theoretical production  limits for wheat in an extraterrestrial colony setting, say they will next turn  their attention to wheat's performance in zero gravity -- a crucial  consideration for the day when mankind embarks on space voyages too long to be  sustained by stored food.    To that end, they are preparing an experiment for a future space shuttle  mission. NASA has approved the project, but it has yet to be scheduled for  flight, the two said in telephone interviews from the school's campus in Logan,  60 miles north of Salt Lake City.      Food and Pure Air    Salisbury and Bugbee say a space farm could feed the Mars mission's crew and  purify air and water supplies. For example, a 13-square-yard space farm could  feed one person indefinitely.    Looking beyond exploration to colonization of the moon and Mars, the  researchers believe that a farm about the size of a football field could  provide the food and oxygen needs of 100 or more people.    A hydroponic space farm, unlike those on Earth, would not be maintained as one  huge unit but would be made up of a number of self-contained compartments to  guard against the spread of plant diseases. Further, it probably would produce  far more food than needed, ranging from 20% to 100% more, as a hedge against  unexpected losses.      Wire    "
0,FT943-12561 ,"FT943-12561 _AN-EGYDPAA0FT 940725   FT  25 JUL 94 / First meeting for Asia-Pacific forum      By VICTOR MALLET      BANGKOK   North Korea's nuclear programme, the Cambodian civil war and territorial disputes over the islands and oilfields of the South China Sea will be among the topics of debate today at the launch of an 18-member multilateral security forum for Asia and the Pacific. But the foreign ministers attending the first, three-hour meeting of the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) in Bangkok say they are unlikely to make substantial decisions on such issues until they have reach agreement on the role of ARF itself. The organisation, the first of its kind in Asia, is being founded to discuss Asian security following the end of the cold war. Russia's power in the region has diminished with the collapse of international communism, and the US has withdrawn some of its military forces from the Pacific, while Chinese economic and military influence is on the rise. All three superpowers are members. ARF comprises the six countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - as well as the US, the European Union, Japan, China, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Korea, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea. The various foreign ministers already meet annually for political and economic talks, and regional security has now been added to their list of concerns. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, opened this year's Asean meeting by calling for urgent efforts to avert any armed confrontation that might arise from territorial disputes in Asia. 'The competition for ocean space and resources in the South China Sea is a particularly worrisome prospect,' he said. 'A regional arms race is another concern. The creation of some kind of regional arms control regime can deter arms build-ups.' Some ARF members, led by Australia and encouraged by the US, want to ensure that the organisation develops quickly and begins to take concrete measures to improve security. They also want officials of the member countries to meet more than once a year. China, on the other hand, favours a slower start for ARF, apparently because it does not want to become enmeshed in multilateral negotiations over territorial disputes when it has so much clout in bilateral meetings. Several ideas for enhancing regional security have already been aired ahead of today's inaugural meeting. The first is an exchange of defence white papers, so that each government can understand how the others perceive their strategic interests and the threats that face them. Another proposal is to establish a regional arms register, especially since some ARF members have yet to disclose details of their weapons to the United Nations register. The need to settle territorial disputes is likely to remain near the top of the agenda, especially in and around the Spratly islands in the South China Sea, where six Asian countries have overlapping claims and China and Vietnam have both awarded oil exploration concessions in disputed zones. One suggested solution is a 'joint development zone' for oil and gas modelled on the offshore zone now being exploited by Thailand and Malaysia.   Countries:-  THZ  Thailand, Asia.

0,FT943-15676 ,"FT943-15676 _AN-EGHDJAAYFT 940708   FT  08 JUL 94 / Russia loses confidence of oil majors      By JOHN LLOYD      MOSCOW   Western oil companies attempting to operate in Russia are now scaling back or freezing their operations in the country and even warning of pulling out completely - citing high taxes, restrictive export quotas, bureaucratic delays, and in-fighting and continuing hostility from Russian production associations to their attempts to exploit the vast resources in Siberia and other regions. Though there have been some encouraging agreements, western executives say the conditions do not permit major investments. A range of medium to large projects are now frozen or in doubt. These include: An agreement signed three years ago by Elf Aquitaine to explore reserves in the Volgograd and Saratov regions. This has been stuck in negotiations between local, regional and federal authorities - an impasse which has meant that no exploration work has yet begun. Mr Daniel Lefebvre, the French project manager, said: 'So far it has proved impossible to work in accordance with legal practice. We hope that it will become clearer by the end of the year.' An agreement negotiated by the German company Deminex - a subsidiary of Veba  -also to exploit reserves in the Volgograd region - is delayed because of a lack of guarantees on investment and a fixed tax regime and 'clear commitments to transport the product', according to Mr Fritz Wenzel, a Veba vice-president. A Russian-US joint venture at the Chernogorskoye field in Nizhnevartovsk, in the Tyumen region, is now under threat because the agreed amount of oil to be exported has not been forthcoming, and the largest part of a Dollars 84m (Pounds 55.2m) loan put up by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation has not been disbursed. A senior executive connected with the project said yesterday: 'The problem is the high tax structure and the inability of the government to enforce the reduction of the export tax as promised. 'One arm of the government is trying to enhance tax revenues any way it can and the other is promising reductions to get investments.' The fields in the Tyumen region, still by far the biggest producer, are now encountering severe problems from flooding - but the oil associations are reluctant to invite in western companies in any other capacity than suppliers of technical assistance. Meetings between western European oil executives and officials of regional associations in the town of Surgut earlier this week showed that the Russian producers were deeply reluctant to admit there was a need for the western companies and the executives were confused about how they might find ways to co-operate. Mr Victor Deshura, chief engineer of Surgutneftegas, a regional production association, told the oil executives this week that 'our problems are not just about investment. I don't believe companies should come in here and try to solve our problems. The intellectual level of our own people is high enough.' The region has already repelled efforts by, among others, BP to set up production projects - and seems likely to continue to do so. At the same time, Russian production continues to fall rapidly - as wells go out of production because of flooding or exhaustion, and none are brought in to replace their lost output. The Petroleum Information Agency said yesterday that production in the first six months of the year stood at 145.5m tonnes - 85.5 per cent of last year's level.   Companies:-  Elf Aquitaine.

0,FT944-6929 ,"FT944-6929 _AN-EK0AOAFSFT 941126   FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Bell-ringing and madness - Radio      By MARTIN HOYLE   Given the tendency for the slightest change on BBC Radio to prompt howls of outrage, the quiet revolution that has transformed Going Places (Radio 4, Friday) into a pendant of Breakaway has passed comparatively bloodlessly. Perhaps others felt as I did that the old format, with its emphasis on adenoidal hearties of both sexes devoted to four wheels, reeked of rusticised suburbia and saloon-bar squire-speak. They never seemed interested in places, merely the mechanics of getting there. The programme is now an idiosyncratic travel piece, not a holiday mag like Breakaway but a smaller-scale exploration of the off-beat - Scotland's secret nuclear bunker, for instance, recently opened as a tourist attraction near Anstruther in Fife. Though it was equipped with a broadcasting studio, the locals had no idea it was there. Chillingly, if disaster struck no family, relatives or friends surplus to personnel were to be admitted. As somebody remarked, many of the elite would have preferred to stay outside. The same programme took composer Gavin Bryars to Whitby with its ruined abbey, kipper-houses and Dracula connection. And memories of a west-country childhood stirred within me at the news that a recalcitrant RSPCA official had hijacked the bell-ringing swan of Wells, releasing it where there are no bell-pulls to tug at teatime and where it presumably has to find its own food. The swan-keeper was strangely dry-eyed. 'My wife was more affected than I was,' he confessed, adding that she was 'a cantankerous old thing but wonderful.' (I assume he meant the swan.) The Madness of Kings (Radio 4) was disappointingly lightweight. It was introduced by Christopher Cooke whose exquisite sensibilities, he once confided to The Heritage Quiz, are jarred by such oafishness as the Last Night of the Proms and Gilbert and Sullivan (notably, I imagine, at the Lord High Executioner's strictures against 'the idiot who praises with enthusiastic tone/All centuries but this and every country but his own'). The mini-series on the addling of crowned heads was inconclusive. Caligula perhaps had encephalitis, Hitler Parkinson's. Nero was not so bad, possibly schizophrenic. The Plantagenets had terrible tempers. Ludwig of Bavaria probably didn't do anything with his young men, though his scheme to rob the Rothschild bank in Frankfurt seems a trifle extreme even by today's free and easy royal standards. The programme acknowledged the danger of describing any boo-worthy behaviour by the all-purpose 'mad'; and then proceeded to do so. Its brief necessarily ignored the hysterical repression that led to middle and lower-class 'madness', breakdowns and suicide in Victorian times. There are records of the mass demise in Bristol of an entire below-stairs staff on the death of their mistress. Those were the days. The nostalgia factor still operates in favour of middle-aged DJs. On Radio John Peel drones on after a quarter-century, his vocal dreariness the aural equivalent of fallen arches. The self-consciously quirky choice of music recalls the modishness that had John Mortimer, no less, singing his praises. But then the distinguished QC once referred to Boy George's 'sweet Irish tenor'. He should be on the new matey Radio 3, along with John Peel, Caligula and bell-ringing swans. They will be, reader, they will be.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4832 Radio Broadcasting Stations.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

Summary of Today's Final Rule           EPA is finalizing a revised version of the January 8, 1988 proposal in today's notice. The final rule states in essence that recovered oil from petroleum refinery operations, petroleum exploration and production, and transportation incident thereto, is excluded from the regulatory definition of solid waste if it is subsequently inserted into the petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. The recovered oil thus need not be generated at the site of the refining process_a potentially significant expansion of the proposal. This exclusion applies, however, only if the oil is not managed in land disposal units or accumulated speculatively before it is inserted.       EPA expects that most of the recovered oil affected by this rule will be generated from wastewater treatment operations. As explained below, EPA is narrowing the proposal (which would have excluded petroleum refining wastewaters containing oil that eventually gets recycled) by finding that refinery operations upstream of recovered oil systems involve wastewater treatment, not an on-going refining process. Thus, petroleum refinery wastewaters undergoing treatment should not be excluded from the definition of solid waste. In addition, even if these wastewater treatment operations are characterized as also involving recycling, the operations involve discarded residuals that can be part of the waste disposal problem, and hence the wastewater treatment operations need not be characterized as part of an ``ongoing production process'' for purposes of excluding materials from the definition of solid waste. Once oil is recovered, however, the Agency believes it reasonable to exclude it from the definition of solid waste if the oil is to be reused in the refining process (even though the oil may still require a significant amount of further processing before it can actually be so reused). This is because the recovered oil and its management within refining operations can be viewed as part of the petroleum refining process and not part of the waste disposal problem.           EPA is also slightly amending the regulatory exemption for petroleum coke produced using oil-bearing refinery hazardous waste (see 261.6 (a)(3)(vii), redesignated (a)(3)(vi) in today's rule). The Agency is slightly broadening the current exemption so that it also applies to coke produced by a single petroleum refining entity, but the coker is located at a different facility from where the hazardous wastes are generated.         As a matter of drafting, the principal change brought about by today's rule takes the form of an exclusion from the regulatory definition of solid waste. Specifically, paragraph (12) is being added to the list of exclusions in 261.4 (a). In addition, EPA is removing the regulatory exemption in 261.6(a)(3)(v) which is superseded by today's exclusion, and redesignating the remaining exemptions in 261.6(a)(3) (vi) and (vii) as 261.6(a)(3) (v) and (vi), respectively, in order to maintain consecutive numbering. EPA is also revising two other regulatory exemptions in 261.6(a)(3). Finally, EPA is making conforming changes to 261.3(c)(2)(ii)(B) and 266.100(b)(3), both as a result of today's rulemaking, and to reflect conforming changes that EPA inadvertently omitted during promulgation of the used oil final rule (57 FR 41566 (September 10, 1992)).       IV. Scope of Today's Final Rule           A. Limiting Scope to Recovered Oil From Petroleum Refining, Exploration and Production           As noted above, today's rule excludes recovered oil generated from petroleum exploration, production and refining activities, and from the transportation incident thereto, from being a solid waste when the recovered oil is inserted into a designated point in a petroleum refining process. This section of the preamble discusses why EPA is crafting the exclusion in this manner. More specifically, we discuss why the exclusion does not cover oil recovered in operations downstream from petroleum refining, and why the exclusion does not apply to recovered oil from industries other than petroleum refining, exploration, or production.

ANALYSTS ARE WATCHING CHAIRMAN KENNETH DERR'S EFFORTS TO TURN THE  COMPANY AROUND.      By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITERDrawing,      It was 1984, the year when much of the world's attention was focused on Olympic  achievements in Los Angeles. In San Francisco, Kenneth T. Derr faced an  Olympian task of his own.    Derr -- then president of Chevron Corp.'s domestic unit -- was given the job of  merging Chevron's immense operations with those of Gulf Oil after his company's  $13-billion takeover of Gulf.    The plain-spoken man, who had made his mark early on as a bright, ambitious  executive, admits now that he did not know where to begin. ""I went home after I  got the job, and I took a whole yellow pad . . . and said, 'I'm going to write  down how the hell to go about this,' "" he said in an interview last week. ""I  sat there for two hours looking out the window and hadn't written a thing down,  and I probably went out and played golf.""    The uncharacteristic indecision lasted only briefly, however, and in the end,  Derr rose to the occasion. He and his Gulf counterpart, James Murdy, devised a  method that relied on advice from 37 employee study teams to restructure the  two companies into one, methodically eliminating 20,000 jobs and selling off  about $5.4 billion in assets to cut debt from the deal.    Afterward, the relative speed and smoothness with which Derr and his team  accomplished the task won widespread praise. And the merger propelled Derr to  the top of the company -- first as vice chairman, then last January as the  company's 10th chairman and chief executive, replacing George Keller.    Now, the 6-foot-3 oilman faces an even stiffer challenge: restoring luster to  the nation's third-largest oil company, whose financial performance lags behind  that of nearly all its major competitors.    The San Francisco-based company's condition has left its stock undervalued and  the company vulnerable to a takeover or forced restructuring, analysts say.  Rumors to that effect have spurred heavy trading of Chevron stock in the past  several weeks, driving the stock to new highs -- although the price is still  below where it should be, analysts say.    Derr, normally anything but shy about speaking his mind, will not comment on  the stock market activity. But in the past year he has taken steps to deal with  Chevron's underlying problems. He has vowed to improve efficiency, cut costs,  widen margins and increase the return to shareholders -- including dividends  and capital gains -- to 15% from 8% through 1993.    In the process, he has decentralized decision making and raised the  accountability of Chevron business units -- bringing to the traditionally  bureaucratic corporate culture a new participatory management style, analysts  said.    In a move typical of the company's new aggressiveness, Derr last week ordered  the creation of a stock repurchase program and an employee stock ownership plan  -- which creates a solid defense against takeovers with a novel use of a  Delaware law. Chevron is incorporated in Delaware.      Company Profile    Can the 53-year-old Derr manage a turnaround? ""That's the question mark,"" said  Frederick P. Leuffer, a senior oil analyst with the C. J. Lawrence, Morgan  Grenfell Inc. investment firm in New York and author of a report that strongly  criticizes Chevron's performance.    ""Their strategy and goals are very admirable: to take the company from a  lackluster performer, improve financial results and returns to shareholders,  and make it one of the best operating concerns,"" Leuffer said. ""That's great,  but I'm not sure how they're going to do it.""    Chevron remains impressive in size. With $34.5 billion in assets, it is the  third-largest oil company in the country after Exxon Corp. and Mobil Oil Corp.  In terms of reserves and market capitalization (the market price of its stock  times the number of outstanding shares), it is the sixth-largest in the world.    In some areas, Chevron is unrivaled: It is the nation's largest refiner,  natural gas producer and wholesale marketer of natural gas liquids.    Its total oil and gas reserves remain strong, although they have declined in  the past four years, positioning the company for improvement should crude and  gas prices turn up as hoped in the 1990s.    And its balance sheet is healthy, with $15.2 billion in equity and only $6.8  billion in long-term debt at the end of the third quarter.    But by other measures, Chevron is ailing:    * From 1984 to 1988, Chevron's 10.8% average return on equity lagged behind  those of six major oil companies, according to Leuffer's report. Its 7% average  return on capital trailed that of five competitors, the report added.    * Of seven major oil companies, Chevron exceeded only Texaco in profitability  from its refining and marketing operations from 1986 to 1988, according to  Chevron's own calculations.    * Chevron spent more than any of the other seven oil companies to find and  produce a barrel of oil in the United States in 1988: $6.18, compared to $5.67  for the next highest, Mobil, said Ray E. Galvin, head of Chevron's domestic  exploration and production operations. Worldwide in the past five years,  Chevron's cost of finding and developing new gas and oil reserves, excluding  acquisitions, has been among the highest, Leuffer said.    * For the first nine months of 1989, Chevron's net income was $1.1 billion,  down from $1.6 billion in the 1988 period. Total revenue was $23.9 billion, up  from $22 billion.    Meanwhile, some of Chevron's most valuable domestic oil and gas properties  remain tantalizingly out of reach.    A sizable oil and gas reserve off Point Arguello in Southern California remains  unproductive, despite a total $2-billion investment by Chevron and 17 other oil  companies, as wrangling continues over the best way to transport oil from a new  terminal near Gaviota to refineries in Los Angeles.    The project drains about $500,000 a day in interest alone from the 18  companies. And because the initial investments were made with the hope that  crude oil prices would rise by 1990 to about $85 a barrel, compared to about  $19 now, the project will lose money at least at first, even when production  starts, Galvin said.    In Alaska, response to the tanker Exxon Valdez oil spill has thwarted efforts  by Chevron to drill on leases that it holds in the coastal plain of the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge.    It is ironic that Derr finds himself at the helm of a troubled Chevron as a  result of his work with the Gulf merger. Leuffer called the merger ill-timed  because it came just before the 1986 collapse of world crude oil prices.    Derr disputes that, arguing that the merger has left Chevron with some of its  most valuable assets. But he and other executives freely admit that much of  what Chevron is doing is intended to catch up with its competitors.    ""We perhaps were a little diverted from some activities of improving  efficiencies in our companies because we were trying to bring them together,""  Derr said.      Derr's Style    Whatever Chevron's problems, Derr himself gets high marks from analysts. A  native of Pennsylvania, Derr graduated from Cornell University with degrees in  engineering and business and joined Chevron, in part, so that he and his new  wife could move to California.    At age 34, he was named assistant to then-Chairman Harold J. Haynes, who became  a mentor. At 36, Derr became the youngest corporate vice president in company  history in 1972. Seven years later, he was named president of the company's  domestic operating unit, Chevron U.S.A.    To each of his jobs, the 225-pound executive brought a refreshing affability,  colleagues said. While awaiting the transfer of nearly $2 billion that would  clinch the sale of Gulf's Canadian unit in 1985, Derr put everyone at ease by  organizing a penny-pitching game in a Toronto boardroom.    ""Ken's a friendly guy,"" said Murdy, the former Gulf chief financial officer who  worked with Derr to merge the two companies. ""But I wouldn't confuse his  (appearance) with the get-up-and-go in him. . . . He's a very confident, able  person.""    D. W. (Darry) Callahan, president of Chevron's Warren Petroleum unit, recalled  that Derr could turn the charm on and off during particularly tense  negotiations with a Dutch company in the late 1970s.    ""Ken knew when he could push a little further and when it was time to back  off,"" said Callahan, who was a staff analyst in the talks at the time. ""It was  like a poker game, where you have to know when to keep on your poker face and  when to put on the big smile.""    During the Gulf merger, Derr showed an ability to delegate by farming out the  initial analysis to study teams. The resulting reports ended up stacked several  feet high on every flat space in Derr's office.    But Derr was not afraid to make tough decisions, even if that meant selling off  assets or eliminating jobs to make the merger work, analysts said. During that  time, Chevron divested itself of its East Coast refining and marketing  operations and its European units, while pursuing an aggressive program of  buying oil and gas assets that culminated in the purchase of Tenneco's oil and  gas reserves last year for $2.5 billion.    It is that ability to manage assets that could help Chevron now.    ""Mainly, what he has to do is decide what to do with a lot of non-performing  assets,"" said Rosario (Sal) Ilacqua, an industry analyst with Nikko Securities  Co. in New York.      5-Year Goals    Chevron U.S.A. plans to spend more than $700 million on 15 projects in the next  five years to upgrade refineries and improve yields of gasoline over less  profitable products, said David R. Hoyer, head of Chevron's domestic refining,  marketing and supply operations. An additional $1 billion is to be spent to  upgrade the Richmond, Calif., refinery, he added.    On the marketing end, the company plans to spend $1.2 billion to build new  service stations and modernize old ones, while closing unprofitable locations  to reduce the total number of company-owned stations to 2,500 from 3,500.    All of which is aimed at improving U.S. earnings by $1 a barrel of refined  product, Hoyer said, up from the current $1.20 to $1.28 per barrel.    On the exploration and production side, Galvin said Chevron U.S.A. will  identify and sell off marginal oil and gas properties. Next year, Chevron  U.S.A. should dispose of $300 million to $400 million in such assets in an  effort to reduce costs, he said.    The five-year goal is to raise the domestic exploration and production unit's  return on capital to 12% or 15% from the current 4%.    But some analysts argue that Chevron's programs do not go far enough.    Leuffer suggested that Chevron concentrate on its production side and consider  selling its five West Coast refineries -- including the ones in El Segundo and  Richmond -- as well as its network of service stations.    Unlike Atlantic Richfield Co., which has carved a niche as a cut-price  marketer, or Unocal Corp., which has an image for upscale service, Chevron has  tried to be all things to all people and has lost market share to the others,  analysts said.    British Petroleum, which has sizable oil production in Alaska but no West Coast  refining or marketing, would be the logical buyer of such valuable assets.    But Derr dismisses such suggestions with annoyance. ""Everyone who's a security  analyst or writes for a newspaper knows what the hell we ought to sell,"" he  said.    ""I think (Leuffer's) an idiot if he suggests that,"" he added. ""The West Coast  is the most profitable refining and marketing asset our company has. . . .  Sure, BP'd probably give their eye teeth to (buy) it, but it's one of the most  important single assets this company has.""    The attention on Chevron's condition has fueled rumors that an outsider may try  to force the company to restructure, or might even launch a takeover. Pennzoil  Co., with cash from its settlement with Texaco Inc. in the battle for Getty Oil  Co., is the most discussed possibility.    Most analysts discount the possibility that tiny Pennzoil could muster the $35  billion that would probably be needed for such a bid, which would be the  largest corporate takeover in history.    Nevertheless, the employee stock ownership plan and the repurchase program  announced last week would raise the amount of stock in presumably friendly  employee hands -- a common defensive tactic.    The unusual twist in Chevron's plan is that it would use stock in the  relatively small employee ownership plan to supplement the 11% of stock held by  other employee benefit plans, in effect raising the total held by employees to  16%, said Joseph R. Blasi, a professor at the institute of management and labor  relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey.    Chevron could then use stock in all of the plans to meet the requirements of a  Delaware law that allows holders of 15% of a corporation's stock to block a  takeover, Blasi said.    ""Chevron has clearly discovered something here, to obtain the Delaware defense  without setting up a huge employee stock ownership plan,"" Blasi said. ""It's  likely to influence the future takeover defenses of a lot of public companies.""    Derr will not talk about any defensive aspects of the plan, arguing that the  company had been planning the employee stock ownership program for months to  take advantage of tax benefits.    But, he said with raised eyebrows and a shrug: ""If there's some other benefits,  whatever they might be, well that's OK.""      SAN FRANCISCO Photo, Chevron operates an oil and gas plant at Gaviota.

0," FR940203-2-00142   FR940203-2-00068        This criterion also encourages States to describe State and local performance standards that lead to statewide systemic reform of secondary education. The ``Local Programs'' criterion is intended to elicit a detailed description of the School-to-Work Opportunities system to be implemented at the local level. The Secretaries expect that, combined, these criteria will result in applicants submitting descriptions of State plans that provide for fundamental statewide restructuring of existing education and training programs.       Changes:     None.       Comment:     One commenter who believed that community-based organizations and the human services sectors are currently under-utilized, suggested that a question be added under the selection criterion ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' to read: ``Does the plan describe methods to ensure high school completion by participants such as graduation assistance programs targeting low-achieving and at-risk youth or offering human services in coordination with education and job training?'' One commenter was concerned that occupational and career information and career guidance and counseling be provided and suggested adding a question to read: ``Has the State incorporated into the Statewide plan provisions for the presentation of occupational and career information and career development assistance to all students in all parts of the State?''

Selection Criteria"," FR940203-2-00142   FR940203-2-00068        This criterion also encourages States to describe State and local performance standards that lead to statewide systemic reform of secondary education. The ``Local Programs'' criterion is intended to elicit a detailed description of the School-to-Work Opportunities system to be implemented at the local level. The Secretaries expect that, combined, these criteria will result in applicants submitting descriptions of State plans that provide for fundamental statewide restructuring of existing education and training programs.

Changes:     None.       Selection Criteria_Collaboration and Involvement of Key Partners          Comment:     One commenter suggested adding State officials responsible for special education, vocational rehabilitation, and other transition services, to the list of State level officials with whom applicants are encouraged to collaborate in implementing statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. Other commenters suggested adding a variety of entities to the list of key parties to be involved in the implementation of States' School-to-Work Opportunities systems. Specifically, commenters suggested adding vocational and comprehensive high schools, local vocational education agencies, private industry councils established under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), related services personnel, State Occupational Information Coordinating Committees and other occupational information providers, human services agencies, JTPA operators and educational programs serving farmworkers. One commenter was of the opinion that the involvement of other parties cannot serve as a substitute for the involvement of students, parents, teachers, and area residents in State and local decision-making. The commenter also felt that the statewide system should include as many as possible of the interested parties listed under the criterion ``Involvement by Key Parties.''       Discussion:     The lists of entities under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of the selection criterion ``Collaboration and Involvement of Key Partners'' are not intended to be exhaustive, but, rather, are intended to provide examples of entities that should be involved in developing and implementing a successful School-to-Work Opportunities system. It is likely that the other entities suggested by the commenters also would contribute to the success of State and local School-to-Work Opportunities activities and it would be appropriate for State and local agencies to seek their involvement. In accordance with these criteria, as well as with paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of the priority, the Secretaries strongly encourage the involvement of all groups and entities that can perform useful and productive functions in the implementation of State School-to-Work Opportunities programs.

These landfills receive a wide range of wastes that may contain significant amounts of organic HAP. Furthermore, the EPA estimates that nationwide there are approximately an additional 1,800 construction and demolition debris landfills currently in operation that can be included in this segment of the off-site waste and recovery operations source category. However, the EPA does not expect wastes received at construction and demolition debris landfills to contain significant amounts of organic HAP.         3. Industrial Wastewater Treatment Facilities         Analogous to landfills, many waste treatment facilities are operated by municipal governments and private companies throughout the United States for the treatment of wastewaters. Wastewater treatment facilities accepting residential and commercial wastewaters are considered to be publicly owned-treatment works (POTW). No POTW are included in the off-site waste and recovery operations source category because POTW are listed as a separate NESHAP source category. In addition to POTW, some privately-owned wastewater treatment facilities process nonhazardous wastewaters received from off-site sources. A nationwide survey was conducted by the EPA of wastewater treatment facilities operating in 1989. Using these survey data, a data base excluding POTW was created. The results of this survey indicate that 15 wastewater treatment facilities were operating nationwide which were neither a POTW nor a hazardous waste TSDF but did process wastewaters received from off-site sources that potentially could generate wastewaters containing organic HAP.         4. Recycled Used Oil Management Facilities         Used oils from motor vehicles and other sources potentially can contain organic chemicals, such as benzene, which have been listed as HAP under CAA section 112(b). Although the management of used oils which are recycled is regulated by separate rules promulgated by the EPA under authority of RCRA section 3014, these rules do not address air emissions from used oil management facilities.     The EPA gathered information regarding recycled used oil management practices in the United States for the development of the RCRA standards. This information indicates that approximately 2,800 million liters of used oil enters the commercial used oil recycling market each year. Approximately three-fourths of this recycled used oil is sent to facilities categorized by EPA as ``used oil processors.'' Used oil processors typically collect used motor oil and industrial lubricating oils. These oils are processed to remove water and sediments from the oils. The processors then sell the oil as a fuel for burning primarily in boilers, furnaces, and space heaters. There were 182 used oil processing facilities operating in the United States in 1991. The remainder of the recycled used oil is sent to facilities categorized as ``used oil re-refiners.'' At these facilities the used oil is processed into base lube oil stocks and other products. In 1991, there were four used oil re-refining facilities operating in the United States. Several companies have expressed interest in expanding used oil re-refining capacity in the United States.         5. Oil and Gas EP Waste Management Facilities         There are a variety of wastes and recoverable materials generated during oil and gas exploration and production (EP). The majority of these materials are managed on-site at the production site (i.e., at the location of the well). However, some EP wastes and recoverable materials generated at the production site that may contain organic HAP are subsequently sent to off-site crude oil reclamation and land treatment facilities.     The EPA gathered information regarding EP waste and recoverable material management practices from EPA conducted site visits and existing industry sponsored surveys. Nationwide, approximately 100,000 Mg/yr of EP wastes and recoverable materials are sent to off-site crude oil reclamation facilities. These materials consist mostly of tank bottoms from crude oil storage tanks or produced water storage tanks. In addition, approximately 135,000 Mg/yr of EP waste sludges are managed in off-site land treatment operations.

Wayne defended the proposed restoration project as the only long-term solution  to the lagoon's deteriorating condition. Major surgery is needed, he said.

He admitted that the problems with the  islanders are currently ""the same as those of 160 years ago.""    The foreign minister thus referred to reports that indicate  that the Kelpers [Falklands Islanders] could negotiate the  exploration for oil with Chile, and that in no way will they  accept a joint venture with Argentina.    Di Tella said that this topic ""is in no way new"" because  ""the  British do not want Argentines on the islands, but they do not  have the same reserve for the Chileans.""    In remarks to a radio station, the foreign minister termed  the position of the islanders as ""lamentable,"" and warned that  the lack of contact with the continent ""will in time become a  ridiculous whim.""    Regarding the July 1994 meeting between Argentine and  British  delegations to evaluate possible bilateral cooperation in the  extraction of oil in the area, Di Tella highlighted his  ""pessimism"" on the probability of reaching an agreement.    ""We have said we are willing to cooperate on the oil topic  before seeking a definite solution to the problem of  sovereignty,"" he explained.    The foreign minister said the results of the negotiations  are  negative, adding that Argentina ""will legally oppose oil  exploitation.""    Although he acknowledged that ""until now the Kelpers have  been willing to evaluate the topic of cooperation,"" Di Tella  believes ""this could or could not imply Argentina's presence on  the islands.""    ""With respect to the Malvinas Islands, I believe our overall  relations suffer the same problems as 160 years ago,"" the  foreign minister admitted, adding that the government ""is  treating the situation with much greater importance than before.""    The foreign minister acknowledged that ""very important  progress has been made in communication with the islanders,  despite official resistance.""    ""I have written letters, sent them presents, spoken over the  radio, and publicly acknowledged that we believe it is important  to recognize their way of life. But we are still far from a  normal relationship,"" the foreign minister said about the  Kelpers.    Di Tella did not reject the possibility that Great Britain  may contract enterprises from other countries to extract oil,  although he added: ""This invitation will be difficult for them  because no one will want to participate in a zone that is in  litigation and where Argentina can proceed legally against  anyone who cooperates in the exploitation.""    Asked to name the organizations before which Argentina could  submit its complaints, the foreign minister replied: ""The United  Nations and the courts of the countries that import the oil.""    With respect to the participation of YPF [Government Oil  Deposits] in the bid to exploit oil through the Romano Houston  enterprise, which apparently bought plans of the areas where oil  presumably exists on the islands, Di Tella stated that he did  not know if the area is rich in oil.    Regarding the purchase of plans, Di Tella explained that ""it  was simply a way for YPF to obtain information,"" adding that  ""some very serious people believe there is no oil on the  islands.""    Finally, the foreign minister stated that the agenda for the  July summit ""does not contain the topic of a possible visit of  President Carlos Menem to Great Britain.""     "

ISA, Australia      Fossils found at one of the world's richest archeological sites have led  scientists to fear for the survival of the platypus, a furry mammal with webbed  feet, a beaver-like tail and a ducklike bill.    Michael Archer, one of the scientists who discovered the fossil site in  northwestern Queensland, believes the platypus may be on the same evolutionary  path as the extinct Tasmanian tiger.    ""I would be delighted if it survives 1,000 years, but I would be surprised if  it lasts 100,"" said Archer, professor of zoology at the University of New South  Wales.    Archer bases his theory on information gleaned from 25-million-year-old fossils  of the platypus's ancestor, the obdurodon, which were found at Riversleigh, a  huge cattle station in the parched savannah below the Gulf of Carpentaria.    ""It was a very important find because it was instrumental in telling us that  the platypus is in evolutionary trouble,"" Archer said.    He explained that the platypus that inhabited the lush tropical forests of  Australia millions of years ago had many advantages over its modern descendant.  Over time, the platypus has become smaller, less versatile and less able to  ward off predators, he said.    ""It used to have a huge set of teeth, it was much bigger and inhabited about  half the continent,"" Archer said.    The numbers that remain are impossible to determine, but the platypus has  disappeared from South Australia, where it was common 100 years ago, said  Dominic Fanning, a research fellow at Taronga Zoo in Sydney.    ""Now the (toothless) platypus only exists on the eastern river systems,"" Archer  said. ""It has become too specialized, less able to adapt to the changing  environment.""    Riversleigh, 160 miles northwest of Mt. Isa, an old mining town, has been  recognized as one of the world's richest fossil deposits, yielding perfect  bones, teeth, skulls and sometimes entire skeletons of creatures that roamed  the continent 25 million years ago.    Since full-scale exploration began at the site in 1983, paleontologists have  unearthed at least 200 new fossil species embedded in the hard limestone.    ""Riversleigh has given us a unique picture of about 25 million years of  Australian life,"" Archer said. ""It was our first glimpse of paleontological  paradise.""    Using explosives, crowbars and sledgehammers, the scientists have uncovered  relics of meat-eating kangaroos, tiny koalas, marsupial lions, insects, bats  and a giant 25-foot python, which they have named Montypythonoides.    Archer and his colleagues return to the site once a year to dig for fossils.    ""Every time we go, we find something new,"" he said.    Before 1983 scientists knew of fewer than 70 Australian land mammals older than  2 million years, Archer said.    However, the Riversleigh deposits -- the exact locations of which are kept  secret to guard against scavengers -- have turned up more than 200.    ""The fossils are giving us information to enable us to interpret the past and,  hopefully, to gauge the future. It is crucial that this body of data be  considered when conservation decisions are being made,"" Archer said.    Archer still keeps a memento in his study of one potentially earth-shattering  discovery, a well-preserved human molar embedded in rock 15 million to 20  million years old.    ""The oldest known human fossils are about 4 to 5 million years old, so this was  extraordinary,"" he said. ""We were jumping with excitement.""    This ""astounding paleontological discovery,"" Archer added, turned out to be an  elaborate hoax by one of his colleagues, who had used all his expertise to turn  a recently pulled wisdom tooth into a fake fossil.

""The oldest known human fossils are about 4 to 5 million years old, so this was  extraordinary,"" he said. ""We were jumping with excitement.""    This ""astounding paleontological discovery,"" Archer added, turned out to be an  elaborate hoax by one of his colleagues, who had used all his expertise to turn  a recently pulled wisdom tooth into a fake fossil.

The utility of space ranges  from the commitment of armed forces to the achievement of  general political objectives (such as observation of the  environment, exploration of natural resources, surveillance of  borders, and inaccessible regions).    On 13 May, the agenda of the Council of Ministers of the  Western European Union [WEU] includes consideration of the  decision to pursue the development of an independent European  system of observation satellites. A report on implementation  possibilities has already been completed; everybody is waiting  for Bonn. The Federal Republic has to decide before the May  session whether it wants to commit considerable capital to such  an ""Eyes in Space"" system.    One argument frequently heard in Germany is: Why spend so  much money on European satellite-supported reconnaissance, when  we can rely on our American partners. The United States own the  most efficient systems and German government offices have  received information from U.S. sources on specific occasions.    However, the whole truth includes the fact that this is  based  on reciprocity. The United States expect something in return.  However, such a policy is not permanently compatible with the  interests of European countries since the United States is  currently redefining its foreign and defense policy priorities  while Europe wants to play a partnership role in the  Euro-Atlantic structure on the basis of independence.    Europe needs an independent capability to receive unfiltered  information and to assess developments outside its borders.  Meanwhile Defense Minister Ruehe in a white book released this  week by the Cabinet has also accepted this view. This document  contains the following clause: ""For the early recognition of  regional crises,...and to defend its interests in developing  joint plans within alliances and the United Nations, the Federal  Government requires an accurate, up-to-date view of the  situation."" This calls for various types of information,  including information gained from satellites: Reconnaissance to  assist in the formulation of policy, not in lieu of policy  decisions.    Here is an example from 1986: For several days uncertainty  prevailed whether a second nuclear power plant in Chernobyl was  threatened with meltdown. If European countries had possessed  satellites with multispectral sensors, there would have been no  uncertainty and the European countries could have taken  precautionary measures based on information thus gained.    However, the Federal Republic is still undecided which  department should become ""responsible"" for such an observation  system since there is, so to speak, no ""natural and primary  user"" for this type of information. Independent experts,  therefore, have suggested appointing an intergovernmental  commission, which reports to the office of the chancellor, to  prepare for the decision in May and to develop guidelines for  reorganization within the government. Time is passing rapidly.  The two specific issues are 20-percent participation in the  Helios 2 Project (daylight observations) developed by France  and, second, majority participation (50 percent or more) for a  high-resolution radar reconnaissance satellite. Because of its  technological capabilities as well as its political status in  Europe's center, no other power is as suited as Germany for an  SAR system (active microwave radar). The cost? It has not been  accurately determined. Experts say: In the initial phase  ""several hundred million a year.""     "
0,FT942-7825 ,"FT942-7825 _AN-EEYBKACNFT 940524   FT  24 MAY 94 / Technology: High price to pay for games at work - Technically Speaking      By TOM FOREMSKI   A survey conducted last year by the US magazine Information Week found that 90 per cent of the executives questioned said computer games were available in their office. Sixty per cent said they were played several times weekly within their company. California-based accountancy company SBT estimates that US businesses lose as much as Dollars 100bn (Pounds 67bn) a year in non-work related use of computers. Clearly, computer games should not be played for fun at work. There are enough problems over determining what productivity benefits work-related computer use delivers. While business applications are often described by their creators as 'productivity packages', computer games could just as easily be described as productivity killers. Yet the same leading vendors of business software often distribute games with their software. The most popular game in US offices is the card game Solitaire, distributed free with the Microsoft Windows user interface. And US software mail order companies sometimes package special promotional deals that include business software with free games. Games are also clogging the Internet international network, hampering its use for commercial purposes. The culprit seems to be Netrek, a space exploration game that involves two teams of eight players exploring a computer-generated universe and interacting with each other. It is designed to be played on networks and players say the game is addictive - so much so that at least one US company is trying to work out a way of charging the public to play it. Computer game developers are well aware that many people play their games in the office. As a result, several games have a feature that flashes a dummy spreadsheet on to the computer display at a touch of a button; this is useful for when the boss walks by. However, certain games can be beneficial if used to educate staff and allow companies to explore different business scenarios. California-based Maxis, best known for its Sim series of computer games, uses its game software technology to create applications that model business operations. It has developed a package for Pacific Gas and Electric, called SimPower, that allows management to simulate the impact of their decisions on power consumption. Banning computer games from work altogether would be difficult. But several large corporations in the US such as Sears Roebuck, Coca-Cola Foods and Ford Motor already have restrictions on game playing. Ford uses special software that scans worker's computer systems to make sure there are no games. However, some smaller companies, especially in the US, approve of game playing as long as it is out in the open. Those which actually encourage game playing at work - mostly in the US  - have properbudgets for game purchasing. At some companies, staff at all levels will play games against each other while connected to the office network. This is said to encourage an esprit de corps. Even so, its value in increasing company productivity is still questionable. Anyone who has played computer games knows how easy it is to lose an hour or more without realising it. So while a policy to ban computer games at work will certainly be unpopular, it may be a necessary step. If staff want to relax, a short walk outside will certainly be more beneficial. Studies have shown that computer game players often experience high stress levels during play. And now that computers are so cheap, there are plenty of opportunities for playing the games at home.

0,FT923-2607 ,"FT923-2607 _AN-CIQC8AFAFT 920917   FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (3): State giant fights a losing battle - Bolivia      By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN   BOLIVIAN mining has two faces. There is the public face which is crumbling, and the private face which looks better with each passing day. Unfortunately for cash starved Bolivia, potential private investors take one look at the state mining corporation, Comibol, and get the jitters about the industry as a whole. They should not do so because Bolivia has many thriving private mining enterprises, which are the key to the country's long-term prospects. In the public sector, the present government has introduced a new mining code and opened up Comibol to joint ventures with private corporations. Unfortunately no amount of legislation will reform this loss-making, bloated and inefficient organisation. Relatively strong mining unions realise joint ventures mean the end of their political clout and are fighting them all the way. In contrast, the government is weak, disorientated and coming up for re-election. Comibol's entrenched middle management and technicians, knowing that joint ventures will cost them their jobs, seems to be doing their utmost to delay and dismiss such deals. Since the concept of joint ventures was first touted as the way ahead for Comibol in 1991, only two deals have been signed, though leasing contracts are fairly common. So far, three companies: Minproc, Cominesa, and a subsidiary of Brazil's Paranapanema, are still unable to start up operations due to industrial action. Comibol recently acquired a new president, Mr Marcelo Perez, a committed free marketeer with no mining experience, and the much criticised Comibol board is strongly rumoured to be about to undergo a major shake-up. But while the government continues to refuse to tackle middle management and unions, potential joint venture partners with Comibol can expect much frustration and disappointment. Nevertheless, there is an incentive for change in the form of the World Bank, which has been withholding a Dollars 35m mining credit originally approved in 1989, Dollars 22m of which is earmarked for the restructuring of Comibol. A team from the World Bank has visited Bolivia to evaluate recent rearrangements within the corporation, which, apart from a new president, include a major redundancy programme. The team may release the credit, but is likely to insist on Comibol jettisoning its mining interests and concentrating solely on administering joint venture contracts. There is a view, however, that it would perhaps be better if Comibol was starved of funds and left to die a natural death. Alternatively, under a new government, Comibol might be disposed of altogether. This is the preference of planning minister Samuel Doria Medina, who is convinced that the country's constitution will be altered to allow the full-scale privatisation of the corporation some time next year. In contrast, the Medium Mines Association, an umbrella organisation of medium-sized private mining concerns, continues to go from strength to strength, thanks to its ability to adapt far faster than Comibol to changing market conditions. Rolando Jordan, the Association's general secretary, explains: 'The 1985 crash in tin prices showed us that our industry was built on the basis of continuing high prices. We have learnt our lesson. New mining operations we subsequently embarked on used modern mining techniques and philosophies.' Overall investment in mining continues to rise, from Dollars 53.1m in 1989 to Dollars 80.7m in 1990 and Dollars 96.1m in 1991. Although growth last year was a disappointing 2 per cent, the dynamic period from 1987 to 1990 saw significant increases of between 14 and 53 per cent. Growth in the Medium Mines was around 3.6 per cent for the first half of this year. However, the ground is being prepared for an early revival. Inli Raymi, a subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold, is investing some Dollars 170m in its existing gold and silver operations and investigating a promising copper and gold deposit. RTZ has uncovered a gold deposit in Puquio Norte, which is to be exploited by Comsur - one example of a successful private joint venture partnership. Cyprus Minerals is confident of finalising a joint venture exploration deal with Comibol covering 100,000 hectares in the Los Lipez region. However, Bolivia's traditional production - tin, tungsten, wolfram and antimony - is geared to survival rather than profit at present. Mr Jordan of Medium Mines acknowledges that five of his current 22 members may be forced to drop out of the organisation by the year's end as a result. In contrast, zinc and silver continue to break production records. Copper and gold are also showing some promise. But it is polymetallic seams - containing silver, zinc, tin and lead - which excite the most interest. The problem in this field is that concentrations tend to be small and transport costs will be crucial to determine viability. Indeed, infrastructure in general is perhaps the greatest physical problem facing mining companies in Bolivia. This is a country roughly twice the size of Spain. Yet much of it is without roads, electricity or communications links. Mr Marcial Garcia, exploration manager with Cyprus Minerals in Bolivia, says: 'The government needs to invest in infrastructure before many mining projects can become feasible.' This year's public investment programme is worth just Dollars 470m, although the figure is up on last year and will continue to rise in 1993, according to finance minister Jorge Quiroga. One project which may help is a proposed road which would link Bolivia to the Pacific Coast. And Peru recently granted Bolivia access to the sea through the as yet undeveloped port of Ilo. While labour problems significantly affect Comibol and its joint venture partners, the situation could change as private ownership of mines becomes more established. Unions are utterly opposed to what they call 'privatisation through the back door.' However, individual miners are aware that profitable private companies provide better pay and conditions. Miners in existing private operations are far less prone to industrial action than their public sector counterparts. The message for potential investors in Bolivia is that mining is composed of two separate entities: public and private. Those brave souls ready to tackle the public sector will need ample reserves of patience, perseverance and political skill. In contrast, many private sector ventures in Bolivia do work, and work well.  The Financial Times   London Page 36  "

This amendment became effective as a requirement on September 22, 1988, and is applicable to all certifications issued on and after that date. Individualized notices and published notices shall contain the information specifically set forth in this part 617.        "
0,FT924-7290 ,"FT924-7290 _AN-CKQCNAFDFT 921117   FT  17 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Where miners need a head for heights - Kenneth Gooding on the problem of altitude sickness in the Chilean high Andes      By KENNETH GOODING   THEY CALL it puna in Chile, scoroche in Peru. The mining industry will have to learn new tricks to live with it. Puna is the catch-all term for the very many symptoms caused by what English speakers call altitude sickness. It will have a profound impact on the way mining companies operate in Chile, a country that many see as the most attractive in Latin America for exploration and development. Much of that country's minerals treasure is locked in the high Andes. Some of the best mines and projects are located above 2,800 metres (9,000 feet), the level at which most people begin to feel the onset of puna symptoms. In no particular order these mines include: Coldelco's Andina and Salvador copper operations; Exxon's Los Bronces copper project on the same ore body as Andina; La Coipa gold project (Placer Dome and TVX Gold) and Bema Gold's Refugio project nearby, both in the so-called Marikunga gold district. There is Cominco's Quebrada Blanca copper project. Billiton, Falconbridge and Chevron are partners in the Collahuasi copper project (but Chevron is selling its stake to Minorco). RTZ owns Cerro Colorado, another copper project. Homestake has the El Heuso project, Cominco the Lobo project and Cocar owns Cancan, all seeking gold. Chile also boasts - for a short while longer at least (its owners Billiton, Northgate and Citibank intend to close it at the end of this year) - the world's highest operating gold mine, Choquelimpie, in the mouth of a dead volcano at 4,825 metres (15,777 feet). Billiton is part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group and Shell Chile is helping to finance a study of the effects of high altitude on miners - research that will be of immense value as activity builds up in that country. The air above 2,800 metres is generally described as 'thin'. It contains the same proportions of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen as at sea level but with increasing altitude there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure. The decrease is gradual and proportional up to about 2,800 metres, but rapidly and disproportionately accelerates as higher altitudes are achieved. When high altitude-low pressure air is breathed into lungs adapted to the higher pressures of lower altitudes, transfer of oxygen from air to blood is reduced and the body experiences oxygen depletion. The body is then forced to work harder to take in extra oxygen and in doing so slips back into oxygen deficit again, creating a vicious circle. The symptoms of puna can include one or all of the following (and the list is not exhaustive): headache, gastric problems, nausea, heart arrythmia, listlessness, vomiting, diarrhoea, lapse of memory, anxiety attacks, feelings of insecurity, loss of appetite, insomnia, shortage of breath, muscular cramps, indecisiveness, lack of motivation, obsessive behaviour, persistent colds, sinusitis, sore throat, painful eyes and loss of vision, fevers and inability to concentrate. All of these are particularly unwelcome on mining sites, where so much heavy equipment is used and operators must feel on top of the job. The impact of puna is different for each individual. Mr Jim Platt, Billiton's chief geologist on the Collahuasi project for four years, has produced a paper on altitude sickness based on his personal experiences. He says there is no way of knowing if an individual needed for the current Dollars 40m exploration programme at Collahuasi will be able to work at that altitude except by taking each one there to see what happens. 'There seems to be no pattern. Extremely fit and active people have been known to suffer badly while some overweight, heavy-smoking types feel no effects,' he says. Mr Platt points out that to guard against the short- and long-term impact of puna, companies in Chile have begun to make use of a 'buddy' system. This involves everyone looking out for the health and condition of everyone else, spotting and signalling any observed deviations from the norm or onset of puna symptoms. This system promotes teamwork and safety-consciousnes. Mr Platt suggests the buddy system is particularly important for detecting potentially dangerous psychological symptoms, such as anxiety attacks, feelings of paranoia and insecurity, a sense of entrapment, intense claustrophobia, obsessive thinking and the edge of a nervous breakdown. By the end of this year the study sponsored by Shell Chile and carried out by the Catholic University of Santiago's cardiology department should be available to throw fresh light on this subject. Among other things, researchers have been checking the Choquelimpie employees at the mine, also at Putre which is 1,100 metres lower and where the mining camp is based, and finally in Arica, a sea-level town, in an attempt to identify any with heart problems or others potentially at risk. Mr Patricio Palma, Choquelimpie's safety officer, says: 'We want to know more about how hearts and lungs function at high altitudes to prevent problems developing, possibly with the help of drugs'. It might also be necessary to change working patterns at the mine, he points out. Fortunately, the cure for puna is simple: the patient is taken to a low altitude as quickly as possible. In severe cases time may be vital. The cure is then so rapid and so complete that some of the afflicted immediately want to return to high altitude, unwilling to believe that they ever had difficulties. Mr Platt insists, however: 'They should under no circumstances be permitted to make a return'. Mining companies wanting to establish a fully-adapted high-altitude crew can expect that for every 100 people selected, 30 to 35 will drop out quickly. Of those, two or three are likely to be very ill indeed. The 65 to 70 who remain may also be subject to significant attrition in the medium term either because they cannot put up with the working environment or as a result of delayed puna symptoms. Mr Platt points to the bottom line for many mining companies in Chile: 'When you are planning to staff a high-altitude project, it is likely that twice the required number of personnel will eventually have to be selected to ensure that basic (mining) needs are met.'

0,FT922-5589 ,"FT922-5589 _AN-CE2ATAFOFT 920529   FT  29 MAY 92 / Arts: Sviatoslav Richter      By ANDREW CLEMENTS   The pianist was scheduled to give two recitals in London's Festival Hall this week, as part of a British tour which has taken him to Oxford (where he was awarded an honorary doctorate) and which also includes Harrogate, Birmingham, Cheltenham and Aldeburgh. Sunday's programme of Bach and Brahms was cancelled at three hours' notice - the pianist was suffering from heat exhaustion. However, on Wednesday he did appear, playing to a darkened auditorium as he always does nowadays, his scores spread before him and illuminated by a single lamp. Richter is 77; the stern, measured platform manner has not wavered. He has always been the most introspective of pianists, but, if anything, his playing appears to have become even more inward-looking and intimate over the years. It is less concerned than ever with projecting grand dramatic schemes, much more focused on a minutely nuanced exploration of phrase structure and expressive meaning. If his sheer technical power seems fractionally more effortful than in the past, the range of colour, touch and articulation remains unequalled. Haydn's F minor Andante con variazioni and Beethoven's Sonata Op. 110 made up the first half of Wednesday's programme. The Haydn was presented at a lithe, moderate pace - for this most Schubertian of Haydn's works one had half expected Richter to settle into his most leisurely Schubertian mode. Each half of the main theme was coloured and flecked with glistening detail, the tiniest of rhythmic emphases, and there was never any doubt about the point and purpose of every single phrase. The sonata offered countless points for contemplation, especially the weighty, deliberate tempo for the scherzo, certainly not the allegro molto of standard usage, yet chiming precisely with the pulsing accompaniment to the main theme of the following Adagio, and the extraordinary, unearthly progression, half muffled, half percussive, that marked the mid-point of the final fugue, in which every voice had its own colour, character and purpose. After the interval, Richter started with Chopin's Polonaise-Fantaisie in a performance almost entirely purged of rhetoric, as if conceived for a handful of friends in a quiet dacha, its focus switched entirely from heroic gestures to the meditations of its lyrical core. He then moved on through Skryabin to Debussy. The Skryabin performances (the two Mazurkas of Op. 40 and the Poeme-Nocturne Op. 61) were astonishing acts of re-creation, poetic fantasies that hardly seemed to touch solid ground for a moment. Debussy's L'Isle joyeuse was warmed into life with infinite patience, the edges of its rhythmic shapes gradually hardened, the colours moving from indistinct greys to bright primaries. More Debussy was offered as an encore: 'La cathedrale engloutie' from the first book of Preludes, a sequence of veiled perspectives, controlled with absolute precision. No one plays Debussy's piano music like Richter; no one combines his musical insights with the complete technical command to realise them exactly. But then, no one plays most of the piano repertory as he does, with such love and supreme intelligence.  The Financial Times   London Page 15  "

Official reports reaching the Department of Foreign Affairs  [DFA] disclosed information from the Hong Kong Government that  47 out of 98 ""attacks on shipping"" during the past 18 months  have been traced to Chinese officials.    The information was formally relayed by the Hong Kong Marine  Department to Admiral Thimio Mitropoulos, chairman of the United  Nations International Maritime Organization [IMO] Safety  Committee.    The Hong Kong confidential papers pointing to China as being  responsible for the attacks were compiled from distress messages  picked up by Hong Kong's Rescue Coordination Center since 1992,  the report to the DFA said.    ""About 47 attacks have clearly pointed to Chinese officials'  involvement, identifying police, customs, naval, and army  officers, right down to serial numbers of patrol vessels,"" the  report added.    Hong Kong had wanted to expose China's alleged involvement  in  piracy in the South China Sea to international attention during  Mitropoulos' recent visit to the crown colony.    But the report noted that information on piracy cases  involving China was deleted from an earlier report by Hong Kong  to the Mitropoulos committee, with Hong Kong's foreign office  and security branch intervening to ensure that the marine  department did not mention any Chinese involvement.    Great Britain and its colony, Hong Kong, along with China,  are members of the UN International Maritime Committee.    Foreign affairs officials, who spoke on condition of  anonymity, said that countries with overlapping claims to the  Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, have chosen ""not to  react"" to the report, since this may be a source of instability  in the region.    ""The Philippine Government, on the other hand, would prefer  to have more proof to determine whether the attacks were carried  out by Chinese officials or by renegade Chinese,"" they said.    The sources noted that although the acts of piracy occurred  outside the Philippines' sea-lanes in the South China Sea,  China's illegal activities may ""disturb the equilibrium"" in the  region.    They added, major shipping nations, such as Japan, Norway,  Greece, and other countries in Europe, through big fleet owners,  should take the initiative in asking the IMO to ""take  appropriate action"" against China.    The Philippines, the sources admitted, lacks naval and air  facilities to monitor piracy in its own waters, including the  portion it is claiming in the South China Sea.    Besides triggering another wave of concern over regional  stability, the piracy cases attributed by Hong Kong to China may  further strain relations between them.    Hong Kong's governor, Christopher Patten, has proposed  several constitutional revisions aimed at giving greater  democracy to the crown colony it reverts to China in 1997.    Patten's proposals, which included giving voters the right  to  elect the majority of its legislators in 1995, have irked China.  Hong Kong's expose on China's alleged piracy is the latest in  the series of irritants between the colony and the mainland.    Earlier, China's insistence to push through with its joint  oil exploration of a portion of the South China Sea with the  cooperation of the U.S.-based Crestone Energy Corp. has renewed  tensions in the region.    Vietnam had claimed that the area China wants to explore is  part of its continental shelf.    Philippine officials have expressed concern over the brewing  feud.     "
