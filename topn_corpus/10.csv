They stressed, however, that the stolen material ""does  not include confidential information"" on the plane.    Aeronautics Engineer Francisco Luciano, chairman of the  Cordoba Materiel Area Administration Council, said that the  stolen hard disks contained information on ""the cost of  different plane components, information that was being prepared  for the bidding that the U.S. Air Force is organizing for 12  May.""    The United States will decide, through this bidding, on the  purchase of 700 training planes. The total cost of the deal is  estimated to be worth between $5 billion and $7 billion.    Luciano stressed that the stolen material ""does not have any  other value than the possibility of determining how many hours  you can invest in manufacturing different plane components"" and  other similar data.    He estimated that the materials stolen are only worth around  $10,000, and included a Hewlett Packard laser printer, software  material, a mouse, a CD-ROM, a scanner, diskettes, and office  paper.    Despite the explanation, however, officials here suspect  that  we are confronted with a case of industrial espionage. The  stolen material is not strategic, but could have had no other  destination than that of some company specifically interested in  the plane bidding.    The case is being investigated by Judge Gustavo Becerra  Ferrer, of the Second Federal Court, who took the precaution of  informing President Carlos Menem about the incident.    So far there is no information on court-ordered legal steps,  but it is understood that he has heard the testimony of various  Military Factory officials and employees working in the area of  computers.    It is presumed that the theft occurred on the night between  31 January and 1 February, when factory personnel were on  vacation. The materials were stolen from the office of the  department called Joint Primary Aircraft Training System  (JPATS), which was working on a U.S. Air Force and Navy joint  training program.     "

Tamara is a state-of-the-art  air defense system, which, according to experts, can uncover  even the ""invisible"" U.S. Stealth bomber.    The attempt to obtain secret information on the production  of  Tamara was supposedly made by a certain Czech arms company.  Stodulka did not specify which company it was, nor did he reveal  any details about the espionage attempt. He did indicate,  however, that the arms company wanted to gain access to  information about Tamara by offering jobs to three key HTT Group  employees.    Ludek Stodulka also said that this unnamed company, in  cooperation with foreign competitors, rendered it impossible for  the HTT Group company to export Tamara, which can fetch up to  $17 million, to one Persian Gulf country. The competitors  supposedly thwarted the long-planned deal, which was to have  been the first export of Tamara since 1992, by spreading false  information about the radar's abilities.     "

Alternate British High Commissioner Colin Jennings visited  Foreign Ministry Permanent Secretary Tasos Panayidhis to explain  the presence of British military officers at Larnaca Airport  last Sunday [17 April]. According to information from British  sources, Jennings claimed that the military officers--two of  whom were at the airport with their children--were observing  airplanes landing and taking off. According to the Cyprus  Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC], Lieutenant Colonel John  Anderson, the British military charge d'affaires, was one of the  military officers. He gave his identification to security men  when they asked him for it and left the airport. The British  claim that Anderson was not at the airport last Sunday, but they  have confirmed that he was on a one-week leave of absence from  the High Commission.    Denying reports by other media, a reliable source explicitly  told CyBC that no Cypriot is involved in the case. Government  spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today told reporters that the  government is not handling the case as espionage.    According to CyBC's information, foreign missions in Cyprus  and Greece have recently embarked on a campaign to collect  information on the implementation of the new defense doctrine.  The same sources said Cypriot security authorities are trying  to limit the efforts of foreign missions to collect information  on the National Guard.     "

Ames' wife, Rosario, pleaded guilty to lesser charges of  espionage and tax evasion conspiracy, but her sentencing was  delayed until August 28th, reports said.    In a brief statement released after his sentencing in  Alexandria, Virginia, Ames said ""I bitterly regret the  catastrophe which my betrayal of trust has brought upon my wife  and son.""    Ames, who had been chief to CIA counter-intelligence  center's  Soviet section, said his wife knew of his spying activities  seven- and-a-half years after the beginning of his ""criminal  activity.""    He said his wife had ""pleaded with me to break off the  relationship with the Russians.""    Before today's sentencing, the Ames signed an agreement with  the federal government under which both would plead guilty and  thereby avoid a trial.    Although Ames' wife Rosario's sentencing is delayed until  August, reports said she would serve some five years in prison,  after which she would be able to take care of her five-year-old  son, Paul.    Paul is now staying with relatives of Ames' wife in her  native Colombia.    Under the agreement, Ames also agreed to cooperate with the  government in assessing the damage done to the U.S. during his  years spying for the Soviet Union and then Russia from 1985  until 1993.    Prosecutors accused Ames of selling intelligence about CIA  personnel and operations to the Soviets and later the Russians  in return for as much as 2.7 million dollars.     "

The FIS Refutes Key Theses of a Book on Nuclear  Espionage""]    [Text] Last week, the Russian mass media started  publishing excerpts from the memoirs of Pavel Sudoplatov, a  grand master of Soviet espionage and sabotage in the  1930's-1950's. One of its main sections is devoted to the  intelligence service's involvement in the creation of Soviet  nuclear weapons and contains sensational revelations implicating  the world's key scientists of the time -- Enrico Fermi, Leo  Szilard, and Robert Oppenheimer -- in leaking Western nuclear  secrets to the USSR. Yesterday, your KOMMERSANT- DAILY  correspondent asked Tatyana Samolis, press secretary of the  Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] chief, to comment on  the allegations.    Ms. Samolis told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that  the  FIS chiefs have already worked out their stance on the matter.  They think that some passages in Sudoplatov's book are a  compilation of actual events, half-truths, and pure invention.  The FIS still holds the opinion that Soviet scientists made a  decisive contribution to the creation of nuclear weapons in the  USSR, whereas intelligence efforts, albeit important and  qualified, had only a secondary role to play.    The FIS director's press secretary did not deny that  starting  September 1941 the Soviet intelligence service did receive  truthful information on efforts to create nuclear weapons in the  United States and the United Kingdom, something which helped  solve a number of technical problems and accelerate the process  of nuclear arms development. But events related to intelligence  activity in that area and the roles of many players were  interpreted in too free, often even incorrect, a manner in Pavel  Sudoplatov's memoirs.    Although special services tend to avoid specific comments on  their methods and sources of information, this time Ms. Samolis  categorically denied allegations contained in the book that the  Soviet intelligence service received information on the nuclear  problem directly from as prominent scientists as Fermi, Szilard,  and Oppenheimer.

Theodori Bezhani, Irakli Sirma, and  Kosta Qirja from Gjirokaster; Vangjel Paparisto from Sarande;  and Panajot Marto and Kosta Cavo, resident in Delvine, are now  being held in prison on the serious charge of ""maintaining links  with the Greek secret services."" Some time ago, they had all  faced the preliminary charges of illegally carrying weapons and  of anticonstitutional activities. Following further  investigations, the Tirana Procurator's Office has now declared  its opinion on the six arrested members of the Greek minority.  Those arrested are almost all leaders of local organizations of  Omonia, or people well-known for their activities in the Greek  minority areas.    The news, since confirmed by the Tirana Procurator's Office,  came only one day after the news conference of the leadership of  the Greek minority organization, at which Omonia Chairman Sotir  Qirjazati had one again asked for the highest Albanian state  authorities to intervene to free the six persons under arrest,  and had reemphasized their innocence. The Omonia leadership  also repeated the demands they submitted about one year ago,  including for ""an increase in local self-government."" Among the  most important demands put forward by Omonia are the right to  Greek-language broadcasting and the right to use two official  languages and two national symbols.    All these developments take place at a time when there is an  evident increase in diplomatic efforts to improve relations  between the two states, which have passed through a chilly  period following last month's serious terrorist incident near  the village of Peshkepi. Meanwhile, following their first  meeting in Zurich, the two foreign ministers, Serreqi and  Papulias, have agreed to meet in Tirana in order to discuss the  problems still existing between the two countries. Albanian  President Sali Berisha himself reemphasized his readiness to  assist the good progress of these relations. Replying to a Greek  journalist's question on 19 May, Berisha said, ""I agree to visit  Athens, of course, if they invite me.""     "

The bulky, black-leather Filofax, owned by Major Scott  Turner  who is assistant director of electronic warfare in the Ministry  of Defence, was leaked to various media outlets after it was  found in long grass last week.    The POST said the man who found the Filofax, identified only  as Mike, had decided to release the diary after he saw what it  contained.    ""This is public information. It is important this be  released because we spend millions of dollars on the  organisation this guy works for and it suggests we spy on people  we consider our allies like India,"" ""Mike"" said. One Filofax  entry, under the heading RNZN (apparently a reference to the  Royal New Zealand Navy), says: ""Indian photos [word indistinct]  DSD get them."" The POST suggested that this entry disclosed  some espionage operation against India. It interpreted DSD to  mean the Australian Defence Signals Directorate.    The Filofax includes a diary, work plans for 1994, duties'  lists, notes of meetings with others in the New Zealand  intelligence community, four used train tickets, two business  cards and details of the officer's recent purchase of a house.    Contents of the Filofax show Turner was coordinating with  the  secret Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), which  runs two large electronic listening bases linked into Australia,  Britain and the US.    There are also references such as ""Tropic Twilight -- Cook  Islands Aug-Sep, Intercept range upgrade 2MHz - GHz"" as well as  some action regarding tensions between Papua New Guinea [PNG]  and the Solomons over Bougainville, a PNG province affected by  civil war.    Defence spokesman John Seward said Tuesday the owner was  getting legal advice ""and will seek police assistance to get it  back"".    Seward said electronic warfare was not spying and the  Filofax  was ""not in itself a classified document.    ""Electronic warfare is a long-established legitimate and  widely known part of military operations.""    Seward said the Filofax was the personal diary of a staff  officer although he said he believed it was unusual for a staff  officer to record classified acronyms in a personal book.     "

""Activities by foreign spies in China aimed at subversion,  infiltration, divisiveness and rebellion have not stopped,"" the  Guangzhou party secretary, Gao Siren, told a recent state  security meeting, the official GUANGZHOU DAILY reported on  Sunday. ""Foreign enemy forces have joined hands to encourage  destructiveness, which is a danger to the social stability of  Guangzhou,"" he said.    The mayor of Guangzhou, Li Ziliu, said many people were  lulled into a ""one-sided"" belief that economic prosperity meant  ""not being conscious about secrecy and the movements of the  enemy.""    The warnings follow a special trip to the Shenzhen Special  Economic Zone in April by the director of the State Bureau of  Secrecy, Shen Hongying, who said those regions on ""the front  line of China's opening to the outside world"" caused the  greatest loss of state secrets. ""The frequent foreign economic  exchanges of Shenzhen... have led to arduous and complicated  secrecy needs,"" Shen said.    Chinese leaders have expressed alarm at the frequency of  contacts between foreigners and Guangdong officials, which they  believe has resulted in disclosure of state secrets.    Officials from other parts of China frequently travel to  Shenzhen or Guangzhou to meet foreign couterparts for the sake  of convenience.    China's concept of enemy spies is not limited to  trenchcoated  diplomats poking around military bases. It includes everyone  from foreign businessmen gathering conventional market data to  journalists doing what in most countries would be considered  their regular work of news reporting.    Shen's and Gao's use of the term jingwai (outside the  border)  rather than waiguo (foreign country) in reference to espionage  activities that are supposed to be aimed against China reflects  their belief that Hong Kong and Taiwan people are possibly the  biggest threat to them.    While political secrets remain closely guarded, economic  reform has made it almost impossible for any significant  economic policy or information to be kept secret for long,  despite the best efforts of the secrecy cadres assigned to every  department of both central and local governments.    Gao said stepped up vigilance in guarding state secrets in  Guangzhou was crucial for both government cadres as well as the  common people.    Li dismissed suggestions that stepped up vigilance in  protecting economic, technological, and commercial secrets would  harm Guangdong's economy. ""All such thoughts are badly  mistaken,"" the mayor said, without further explanation.     "

Asked about the BND's future tasks, Bernd Schmidbauer,  intelligence coordinator in the Federal Interior Ministry, says  it will deal with the problems of ""drugs, money laundering,  terrorism, and problems related to proliferation, meaning the  export of instruments and machinery for the production of  weapons of mass destruction, which, in view of the changed  world, is one of the important central points.""    Asked whether the new tasks include dealing with the large  area of industrial espionage, Schmidbauer says: ""It does, as  far as prevention is concerned; it does not, as far as active  industrial espionage is concerned. The FRG does not pursue  industrial espionage with its intelligence services.""    The video shows a ""confidential BND document"" that says ""the  opposite."" It reveals that ""Department I, the most important  BND department, which is responsible for active espionage, is  being restructured. The author of the paper is Volker Foertsch,  head of Department I and a confidant of Minister in the  Chancellor's Office Schmidbauer. This document not only deals  with proliferation, organized crime, and international drug  trafficking. Among other things, the BND work will in the  future be focused on Comp Int, or competitive intelligence -- in  other words, industrial espionage.""    Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, an ""intelligence expert,"" says ""the  creation of such a section in BND Department I means agents from  Pullach will in the future steal foreign companies' internal  secrets to make them available to German firms for competitive  advantages. The BND pursued such activities in the past in  exceptional cases, but is obviously planning to do so  systematically.""    According to ``Monitor'', the BND is prohibited by law from  carrying out industrial espionage abroad. ""But this is  precisely what the service is planning to do,"" says the  correspondent. ""What the BND means by competitive intelligence,  or industrial espionage, is described in an internal working  paper, which demonstrates by a U.S. example what -- as it says  verbatim -- competitive intelligence as such means.""    The video shows a document that deals with the way a U.S.  firm obtains information from the U.S. NSA on the planned  introduction of a new microchip generation by a foreign producer.    The BND ""cooperates closely with German industry, and, in  addition to the Federal Government and federal authorities,  German firms are among its consumers."" Schmidbauer denies this:  ""This has never been the case, and it will not be the case in  the future. Of course, certain information is passed on to  private institutions by the responsible authorities if such  institutions are concerned. This is not the rule, however, but  the exception.""    The video shows an internal BND document ""for official use  only."" Apart from government authorities and NATO, ""we also find  industry as a consumer of BND information.""    Schmidbauer says he does ""not know this document. I repeat,  this would be an activity that would be incompatible with the  legal bases of the Federal Intelligence Service. If such  information really exists, we must examine it and, if necessary,  submit it to the Parliamentary Control Commission.""    According to these documents, the ""BND passes on secret  information to German industry, and intends in the future to spy  on foreign firms as well -- illegally, but in the world trade  war, one does not hesitate to use dirty tricks in this country,  too,"" the ``Monitor'' report concludes.

An opposition MP said the three, all Russian-language  experts, had been dismissed by the Australian Security  Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) on suspicion of having  compromised national security.    Liberal backbencher Ken Aldred, responsible for a series of  disclosures about Russian espionage activities here, claims ASIO  decided not to charge the three with espionage fearing the  embarrassment of another spy controversy.    ASIO, closely modelled on Britain's MI5 domestic  intelligence  agency, has been wracked in recent months by revelations it was  penetrated and compromised by foreign intelligence agencies.    The Australian intelligence operations are now the subject  of  two major inquiries after a series of embarrassing episodes in  the last year, including the arrest of ASIO officer George Sadil  and the expulsion of six Russian diplomats for alleged spying.    Sadil been committed to stand trial on 24 espionage charges.    ASIO's telecommunications and computer networks are said to  have been replaced because they had been bugged by foreign  intelligence and were no longer reliable.    Aldred has also asked Canberra to explain why former Soviet  spy Valeriy Zemskov was allowed to enter Australia after it was  informed he had been exposed to British intelligence by Soviet  defector Oleg Gordievsky as a member of the elite KGB ""special  reserve.""    ""Why did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade push so  hard for his entry and who were members of the influence network  he built of senior Australian public servants?"" Aldred asked in  a parliamentary question Tuesday night.    ""What is the government hiding?""    Aldred told AFP Wednesday that about 30 senior Australian  public servants, ministerial staff and others were currently  under investigation by one inquiry, because of associations with  Zemskov and for other matters.    The latest three Canberra-based agents to be accused were  former colleagues of Sadil and all had been co-operating with  him, Aldred said.    It is believed concerns about their conduct were raised by a  long-running undercover investigation by the Australian Federal  Police codenamed Operation Liver.    In his question Aldred claimed Australia's intelligence  community was ""in a state of crisis"".    He asked if the three had been forcibly retired by ASIO and  if it was true the government wanted them to go quietly rather  than take action against them.    He told AFP Wednesday three separate sources had confirmed  his information which suggested the three, who translated highly  sensitive material including intercepts, had been a serious  threat to national security.

An opposition MP said the three, all Russian-language  experts, had been dismissed by the Australian Security  Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) on suspicion of having  compromised national security.    Liberal backbencher Ken Aldred, responsible for a series of  disclosures about Russian espionage activities here, claims ASIO  decided not to charge the three with espionage fearing the  embarrassment of another spy controversy.    ASIO, closely modelled on Britain's MI5 domestic  intelligence  agency, has been wracked in recent months by revelations it was  penetrated and compromised by foreign intelligence agencies.    The Australian intelligence operations are now the subject  of  two major inquiries after a series of embarrassing episodes in  the last year, including the arrest of ASIO officer George Sadil  and the expulsion of six Russian diplomats for alleged spying.    Sadil been committed to stand trial on 24 espionage charges.    ASIO's telecommunications and computer networks are said to  have been replaced because they had been bugged by foreign  intelligence and were no longer reliable.    Aldred has also asked Canberra to explain why former Soviet  spy Valeriy Zemskov was allowed to enter Australia after it was  informed he had been exposed to British intelligence by Soviet  defector Oleg Gordievsky as a member of the elite KGB ""special  reserve.""    ""Why did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade push so  hard for his entry and who were members of the influence network  he built of senior Australian public servants?"" Aldred asked in  a parliamentary question Tuesday night.    ""What is the government hiding?""    Aldred told AFP Wednesday that about 30 senior Australian  public servants, ministerial staff and others were currently  under investigation by one inquiry, because of associations with  Zemskov and for other matters.    The latest three Canberra-based agents to be accused were  former colleagues of Sadil and all had been co-operating with  him, Aldred said.    It is believed concerns about their conduct were raised by a  long-running undercover investigation by the Australian Federal  Police codenamed Operation Liver.    In his question Aldred claimed Australia's intelligence  community was ""in a state of crisis"".    He asked if the three had been forcibly retired by ASIO and  if it was true the government wanted them to go quietly rather  than take action against them.    He told AFP Wednesday three separate sources had confirmed  his information which suggested the three, who translated highly  sensitive material including intercepts, had been a serious  threat to national security.    ""The government apparently preferred that they just go  quietly rather than have the embarrassment of charging further  people, which would have made the whole system look like it was  falling apart, which it probably is,"" he said.

It was here that Yuriy  Andropov, the chairman of state security worked. After him, no  one else occupied this office, and practically nothing in it has  changed to this day.    But plenty has changed in the structure of the Russian  security services. Names, leaders, and to a certain extent the  personnel have changed. Russian counterintelligence, as the  professionals themselves admit, is not having a very good time  at the moment. Open borders and imperfect legislation do not  help to catch spies -- and this at a time when Russia remains,  as she always was, a huge source of new technology -- a fact  well understood not only by Western secret services but also by  ordinary commercial companies.    [Aleksandr Mikhailov, head of the Federal  Counterintelligence  Service, FSK] ""There are foreign secret services on Russian  territory, and they do periodically forget their sense of  moderation and the fact that they are guests here, and begin to  act fairly openly in their own interests.""    [Correspondent] At the most approximate estimate, there are  about 120,000 foreigners illegally present in Moscow and Moscow  Oblast at the moment. Of course, not all of them are spies. In  any case, the greatest damage is caused not by foreign spies but  by our own ones. We no longer have the concept of a specialist  who is not allowed to leave the country, practically everyone is  allowed to go abroad. But practically everyone here earns God  knows how little, so the market for potential spies here is  bigger than ever.    Vadim Sintsov, alias British intelligence agent Demetrius,  only worked as a spy for about a year, and was uncovered  recently and is now testifying from Lefortovo.    [Sintsov] ""A certain Mr. James Self started working with me.  After a while he introduced me to his receiving side, that is, a  communications officer. They met me in other countries, that  is, not in Russia. But in about the fall, they started to  develop an option for communicating here.""    [Correspondent] Sintsov does not know why, of all the  specialists with access to the information that interested the  British, they chose him. It might be simply that the British  secret services got hold of documents that compromised Sintsov,  and were sure that he would work with them. Sintsov got about  $12,000 from the British over a year -- not much by Western  standards. In comparison with the prices for services of this  kind a few years ago, our spies are getting paid a lot less now.  But there are still plenty of people wanting to share state  secrets with foreign powers. Just last year about 20 agents were  uncovered in Russia.    [Mikhailov] ""In the West, according to our information, a  fairly respectable database on our leading-edge technologies and  our armaments and new inventions has already been formed.""    [Sintsov] ""They were mainly interested in two things, two  areas where I could offer information due to my official  activity. The first was Russian arms deliveries to Middle East  countries, and the second was general issues of the organization  of arms deliveries here.""    [Correspondent] It is interesting, however, that science and  technology may develop, the main methods used by agents from  various countries have not changed over many years and centuries.    [Mikhailov] ""The main weapon, as before, is the agents.""    [Correspondent] Just as before, they use compromising  material to recruit, hiding places that look like canned food,  special writing, and even a password when two agents meet. As  the specialists themselves say, there are intelligence services  from friendly countries, but there are no friendly intelligence  services. Incidentally, just yesterday the FSK detained three  DPRK embassy employees in an attempt to obtain examples of new  armaments, as well as a diplomat from Africa for other espionage  activity.     "

The same  Ames whom FBI agents recently arrested for spying for Moscow.    ""I myself was blown in 1985,"" Gordiyevskiy said in an  hour-long Finnish television broadcast. ""And all these years I  have been trying to find out who exactly was to blame for this  happening. When the scandal of Ames' arrest broke I realized  that he was obviously the one....""    How exactly could Ames have known about the former KGB  colonel's double game if, according to Gordiyevskiy, British  intelligence did not give his name to the Americans? He said  that the most important information he passed on to the British  was sent from London to Washington, but in a ""depersonalized  form."" Nevertheless, based on knowledge of these reports Ames  evidently came to the conclusion that the information was coming  from a person who at that time was working in London and who was  previously in Scandinavia. Thus the KGB determined the source  which was leaking important information.    This supposition, Gordiyevskiy believes, is confirmed by the  following fact. It has now been learned that the Soviet side  transferred the first major reward to Ames' bank account 18 May  1985, while Gordiyevskiy, the KGB station chief in London, was  recalled to Moscow 17 May. In the USSR it became clear to him  that he had been exposed, but he managed to escape abroad.    The former KGB colonel recounted that, as it turns out, he  was acquainted with Ames. After his flight from Moscow he  traveled to the United States several times and met with leading  CIA officers there. Gordiyevskiy now recalls that Ames was  present at these conversations, during which Ames smiled at him.  It is clear that the Soviet Union knew everything that was told  to the Americans.    A large part of the interview was devoted to the Soviet  special services' work against Finland. The KGB colonel  reported that the main agent network was recruited immediately  after the war. At that time the country ""was on its knees,"" so  it was not so very difficult to incline people toward  cooperation.    Agents were recruited from various strata of society. Even  from among church officials. Not to carry out intelligence work  but to make, for example, a copy from the church register needed  by a Soviet Karelian illegal agent concerning his ""birth in  Finland.""    Gordiyevskiy disclosed that the KGB's strongest positions  were in the Finnish Center Party, which formed the country's  government many times. The station later penetrated the ranks  of the Social Democrats and even of the Conservatives.    The KGB station chief in Finland, Gordiyevskiy stated, used  to receive encrypted messages from Moscow containing the main  points of comments which were to be put into the mouths of  eminent Finnish politicians. For instance, he met with former  Finnish President Urho Kekkonen and spoke to him in roughly the  following terms: It is desired that during your visit to  such-and-such a country you could say the following for the sake  of world peace....    ""For your convenience we have even composed the text,"" the  station chief would smile and take a sheet out of his pocket  with the main points typed in Finnish.    The former colonel believes that Finland is now being used  in  work against the Baltic countries. Gordiyevskiy said that  Moscow believes that Western intelligence services are actively  using these states to spy on Russian territory. On the other  hand, Russia wants to know everything about the intentions of  the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian Governments.    At the end of the broadcast the double agent was asked  whether the death sentence pronounced on him back in the years  when the USSR existed had been quashed, and whether he had  received an amnesty from the State Duma, which released Rutskoy,  Khasbulatov, Makashov, and others from custody.    ""No, it has not been quashed,"" Gordiyevskiy said. ""But I do  not want any amnesty from this Red-and-Brown Duma. The death  sentence is my reward and my banner....""     "

The  submarines called at the White Beach Base of the U.S. Navy in  Okinawa on 17 occasions at maximum and frequent the Sasebo Base  in Nagasaki prefecture and the Yokosuka Port.    The brisk activities of U.S. nuclear submarines are related  to the expanded scope of the the U.S. naval espionage against  the DPRK, said ITAR-TASS June 20.    The news agency said U.S. nuclear submarines navigating  along  the shores of the DPRK are specialised in collection of  information about the communications network of the Armed Forces  of the DPRK and every possible eavesdropping of radio  communications.    U.S. nuclear submarines enter Sasebo Port of Japan but stay  on the waters off the harbour for more than an hour, not  anchoring at the wharf, in order to hand over information,  experts say.    The activation of the espionage of U.S. nuclear submarines  near the coast of the DPRK coincides with the intensification of  the U.S. hostile campaign to stifle the DPRK.     "

On June 19, 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in the electric  chair at Sing Sing prison for the crime of conspiracy under the Espionage Act  of 1917. To this day, I am haunted by the poignant images of their last days --  the Rosenbergs, side by side, but separated by the wire mesh of a prison van;  and their young sons, soon to be orphaned, being led away from the prison gate  by their parents' weeping attorney.    And, to this day, we are still haunted by the same questions that pervaded the  Rosenberg case from the outset: Were they guilty? And even if so, were they  fairly tried and duly executed under the law? According Joseph Sharlitt's  ""Fatal Error,"" the latest addition to the substantial literature of the  Rosenberg case, the answer to the second question is a passionate and anguished  ""No.""    Like Louis Nizer, whose ""The Implosion Conspiracy"" was a leading work on the  Rosenberg case for many years, Sharlitt is an attorney who has studied the  legal record in great depth and with a sophisticated eye. But, unlike Nizer,  Sharlitt gained access to new and shocking information about the inner workings  of the Supreme Court in the Rosenberg case; and, unlike Nizer, he concludes  that justice was not done.      'Disregarded the Law'    After studying the final appeals of the Rosenbergs in the United States Supreme  Court, Sharlitt is convinced -- and he convinced me -- that the high court  condemned Julius and Ethel Rosenberg to death in the face of compelling reasons  to overturn the conviction or at least to stay the execution.    ""The Supreme Court rushed the Rosenbergs to the electric chair in violation of  their rights before that Court,"" Sharlitt insists. ""The Supreme Court  disregarded the law, its own traditions, and violated the rules that govern the  conduct of the justices, in its dash to kill this couple.""    At the heart of the book is a fairly abstruse legal argument that was raised at  the 11th hour by a couple of freebooting lawyers who intervened on behalf of  the Rosenbergs.    Essentially, they argued that the Rosenbergs had been tried and convicted under  the wrong law -- the Espionage Act of 1917, which empowered the trial judge  alone to sentence the Rosenbergs to death, instead of the Atomic Energy Act of  1946, which would have required a jury recommendation for the imposition of the  death penalty. If the 1946 act applied to the alleged conduct of the  Rosenbergs, Sharlitt concludes, ""the Rosenbergs were executed illegally.""      Angry, Elegant Treatment    I am deeply impressed by Sharlitt's ability to write plainly and persuasively  about some of the most obscure twists and turns of the law -- ""Fatal Error"" is  a tough, blunt, angry book that never condescends to the lay reader, and never  sacrifices the elegance or subtlety of the law for sake of a cheap rhetorical  point.    (Sharlitt is a seasoned international trial lawyer, and I imagine that he's a  master when it comes to the closing argument before the jury.)    But the real drama in ""Fatal Error"" is Sharlitt's intimate account of the  day-by-day, hour-by-hour struggle of the self-appointed defense lawyers to  bring their new arguments before the justices of the Supreme Court in the last  week before the execution of the Rosenbergs -- and the heartbreaking antics of  the Supreme Court justices and other federal judges in their equally frantic  efforts to toss away a judicial hot potato.    Sharlitt's vivid portrait of the volunteer champions of the Rosenbergs, Fyke  Farmer of Nashville and Daniel Marshall of Los Angeles, is a healthy reminder  that at least some lawyers are motivated by the purest idealism and a  rough-and-ready sense of justice.    And their skirmishes with the Rosenbergs' own lawyers -- who, at first, shared  the opinion of the federal judiciary that Farmer and Marshall were  ""interlopers"" and ""intruders"" -- only heightens the tragic irony of the case.    Sharlitt also reveals how the mean-spirited politics of the high court -- and  not the sober consideration of legal issues -- sent the Rosenbergs to the  electric chair.    William O. Douglas, defying a gentleman's agreement among his fellow justices  to take no further action on the Rosenberg case, unilaterally issued a stay of  execution to permit a fuller consideration of the new issues. The other  justices were hastily recalled from their summer recess in order to overrule  Douglas, and thus to punish him.    ""It is a damning comment on the High Court's conduct during that week,"" storms  Sharlitt, ""that a legal point that had never before been raised, that should  have spared the lives of the defendants, that was wholly correct even though  scores of judges and lawyers had missed it entirely, was summarily brushed  aside by the Supreme Court of the United States because of personal pique of  judge against judge.""      Focus on 'Technicalities'    ""Fatal Error"" is not concerned with the ultimate question of the guilt or  innocence of the Rosenbergs. Rather, Sharlitt focuses narrowly on the  procedures by which the Rosenbergs were tried, convicted and executed, and he  concludes that these proceedings were tainted by legal and ethical  improprieties -- ""a major miscarriage of justice.""    In that sense, ""Fatal Error"" deals with what Dirty Harry might call  ""technicalities"" -- and Sharlitt concedes that his book is ""the brief that the  Rosenbergs were never allowed to write.""    But these are technicalities that go to the very heart of our system of  justice, and Sharlitt's advocacy is simply brilliant. He has a genius for  making the law -- and the Rosenberg case itself -- come alive in novel and  surprising ways. And, even to the casual reader of the Rosenberg canon, ""Fatal  Error"" became indispensable on the first day of publication.

""It is a damning comment on the High Court's conduct during that week,"" storms  Sharlitt, ""that a legal point that had never before been raised, that should  have spared the lives of the defendants, that was wholly correct even though  scores of judges and lawyers had missed it entirely, was summarily brushed  aside by the Supreme Court of the United States because of personal pique of  judge against judge.""      Focus on 'Technicalities'    ""Fatal Error"" is not concerned with the ultimate question of the guilt or  innocence of the Rosenbergs. Rather, Sharlitt focuses narrowly on the  procedures by which the Rosenbergs were tried, convicted and executed, and he  concludes that these proceedings were tainted by legal and ethical  improprieties -- ""a major miscarriage of justice.""    In that sense, ""Fatal Error"" deals with what Dirty Harry might call  ""technicalities"" -- and Sharlitt concedes that his book is ""the brief that the  Rosenbergs were never allowed to write.""    But these are technicalities that go to the very heart of our system of  justice, and Sharlitt's advocacy is simply brilliant. He has a genius for  making the law -- and the Rosenberg case itself -- come alive in novel and  surprising ways. And, even to the casual reader of the Rosenberg canon, ""Fatal  Error"" became indispensable on the first day of publication.      Book Review    "

This was  reported by a diplomatic source that does not wish to be  identified in order to avoid difficulties in office.    Skodaexport Director General Jan Ricica, however, rejects  the  espionage charge. ""Espionage activity is completely  unrealistic,"" he said. He emphasized that following the  intervention of the Czech ambassador to Tehran, Tyl was released  with the explanation that the suspicions had not been confirmed.    Tyl was arrested shortly after the departure of the Skoda  Plzen delegation that had visited Tehran to establish business  contacts and also discussed the possibility of supplying Iran  with modernized T-72 tanks. While some sources place Tyl's  arrest precisely in the context of Skoda Plzen Director General  Lubomir Soudek's business negotiations, Ricica said that such a  connection seem unlikely to him. Nevertheless, Tyl participated  in all Soudek's meetings in Tehran.    The Skodaexport director general also said that he could not  think of any reason for detaining Tyl. ""Since there was no  indication of any links with the Skodaexport business activities  in the course of the incident, we are certain it must have been  a misunderstanding or a case of mistaken identity,"" he declared.    The Skoda Plzen business mission to Iran created suspicion  among some intelligence services that Skoda is trying to acquire  a share not only in supplies of conventional arms, but also of  technology for the Iranian nuclear program.    Tyl was detained by Iranian security on 7 December last  year,  and released five days later. He had worked in Iran for almost  four years. Following the incident, however, he returned home.  The arrest cut his planned stay in Iran by approximately 14  days.    In response to our question, the Iranian Foreign Ministry,  through its Prague embassy, refused to comment on the  circumstances of Tyl's arrest.    According to experts on this area, it cannot be ruled out  that the Iranian security service was attempting to find out  whether Tyl had any information about the Iranian nuclear  program.    Ricica considers Tyl's arrest a thing of the past. He says  he does not expect it to have an impact on future business  cooperation.     "

Owing to the fact that the remuneration I am entitled to  from  that secret service to which you referred has yet not been  remitted to me, I am asking for your support in my efforts to  collect the amount the French secret service owes me in exchange  for the information I offered them about the sessions of the  Supreme Defense Council of the country, and which, according to  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, were ""channeled"" there via your hero, Radu  Petrica Popa, whom the daily you head presented not as a crook,  but rather as a victim of deception.

The same English spy participated in  the mixed team of English-American spies who acted at Larnaca  Airport when an aircraft was transporting war materiel for the  defense of Cyprus. He travels in a ""Land Rover"" with a Cypriot  license plate, and he has been seen many times entering the  Turkish-occupied areas at Dhekelia-Pergamos.    I MAKHI reveals today that: ""He is Major Edwin Dougan, who  is one of the leading members of the British Espionage Service  MI-6, serving (seemingly) at the Episkopi Camp.""    The ""hardcore team"" of the English-American spies who were  arrested by members of the National Guard--and then handed over  to the police--consisted of three officers: Two English and one  American. According to I MAKHI's information, English Maj.  Edwin Dougan of the ""MI-6"" was the ""companion...."" of American  Maj. Scott David Dorney, assistant military attache at the U.S.  Embassy. Coordinator of these two spies was Lieutenant Colonel  John Anderson, who serves as military attache at the British  High Commission.    I MAKHI has information revealing that on the day of his  ""espionage action"" Edwin Dougan was traveling in a ""Land Rover""  with civilian license plate numbers BB495.    Diplomatic sources have revealed to I MAKHI that the ""Land  Rover"" with license plate BB495 has been seen many times in the  past heading for the Turkish-occupied areas and entering these  areas from the direction of Dhekelia-Pergamos.    According to other I MAKHI's information, American Maj.  Scott  David Dorney graduated from the War School of Greece in  1989-1990, speaks Greek fluently, and frequently visits Greece.    However, concerning this serious case of espionage against  the defense of Cyprus and the security of the Republic of  Cyprus, although there is no official follow-up to it--for the  time being--the competent security authorities (Central  Intelligence Service and the Second Staff Bureau of the National  Guard General Staff) ""have not been inactive.""    Every piece of information is evaluated and cross-checked  carefully. It appears that the tentacles of espionage against  the National Guard are long.    What causes concern are that the recipients (as was also  revealed by I MAKHI) of the espionage material are the Turks and  what the spies' aims are.    Meanwhile, the English and American diplomatic spokesmen in  Nicosia deny all this ""about espionage and they do not want to  hear another word....""    Moreover, in order to show that their men are not  spies...they have announced that ""their men are not going to be  sent home...."" In any case, the American Dorney and the  Englishmen Anderson and Dougan have cut their movements to a  minimum, rarely leaving their offices....     "

They described it as one of the greatest  events in spying operations so far.    In the wake of the disclosure of this news, U.S. President  Bill Clinton announced that he has ordered an enquiry and  investigation in order to speedily clarify the details of such  an event.    The subject of espionage and the reason why Russia and  America, under the conditions when the Cold War has already  ended, are trying to get informed of one another's secrets, have  drawn the attention of the world people.    At the end of the Cold War the heads of the CIA and the  Russian intelligence organization, KGB, in their speeches, had  dismissed continuation of the past policies that arose from  mutual distrust and proposed cooperation in various fields. But  facts now show that both countries still lack trust toward the  other. For this reason they continue to make use of their spy  organizations for acquiring secret information on the actions  and decisions adopted by the opposing country.    America is now trying to acquire precise information on  Russian policies in various parts of the world, especially in  the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union and  possibly to create grounds for its political influence in them.  In this regard one may refer to the murder of a CIA official in  Georgia last year. That event roused Moscow's anger, vis-a-vis  America.    It appears that spying measures of America, in order to  penetrate Russia and the newly-independent republics, have led  to the fact that Russia's spy organization too pursues its  operations to counter the rival's designs. However, it often  happens that spy organizations, based on their facilities,  penetrate sensitive administrative and intelligence centers of  the opposing country. Of course such an act, based on  undermining the prestige of one of these two states, may bring  sharp reactions in its wake.    In connection with the disclosure of the recent spying  episode, it appears that Mr. Clinton is extremely wrathful and  it is probable that he may adopt fresh decisions on U.S.-Russian  diplomatic ties. Inflection of this blow on the Clinton  Administration will compel Washington to have a closer survey of  the rulers in Moscow and to adopt caution in its ties. But  despite this one cannot stress the point that America will also  reassess its policies on supporting the reformists and checking  the ultra-nationalists. This is because in such case America  will have to ready itself for return to the Cold War era and  intense rivalry between the CIA and the KGB.     "

Israel in return accuses  Egyptian officials of being behind the assassination of Albert  Atrakchi, former administrative attache in the Israeli embassy  in Cairo. It bases this accusation on Egypt's demand for his  withdrawal before his assassination after accusing him of  involvement in spying activities against Egypt.    The Israeli security delegation's visit will be made under  the cover of searching for the remains of 19 Israeli officers  killed during the October war. But the main objective of the  visit is to discuss the worsening security crisis between Egypt  and Israel. Israel is demanding the release of four Israeli  spies arrested in Sinai last year in return for releasing eight  Egyptians detained in Israeli prisons. One of the important  Egyptian security organs refuses to release the Israeli spies,  who were caught with 24 rolls of film of vital installations in  their possession as well as reports on Egypt's peaceful nuclear  program and the ministries' buildings, activities, and guards.    More than 16 Egyptians in Sinai had reported that the four  spies had contacted them in an attempt to recruit them.    The Egyptian side is also raising the issue of the role of  six Israeli officers in distributing weapons inside Egypt,  particularly in Upper Egypt. The six officers are: Mordechai  'Azar, Benyamin Vataniyu, Ra'ul Farhat, Menahem Raymond, Shoktol  Avraham, and Soson Musa. All of them are members of the Israeli  military intelligence service and were helped by two of staff of  Israel's Cairo embassy to smuggle weapons in diplomatic bags.  The Egyptian security services monitored 12 contacts between  these two employees and 35 Egyptian figures; they arrested 22 of  the latter and seized weapons like those captured with terrorist  groups. Egyptian authorities have asked for the recall of the  involved embassy staff.    Egypt has also protested a new attempt to continue with the  same activities by three embassy employees who were recently  expelled. Israel objected to this expulsion, regarding it as a  non-cordial act.    The talks will also involve the activities of the Israeli  Academic Center. Egyptian authorities have in their possession  documents on research and information collected by the center,  including four documents about the People's Assembly and two  about the cabinet, in addition to documents and other studies on  the ministries of defense, interior, education, economy,  agriculture, industry, and planning.    Egyptian security organs' reports noted that diplomatic  pouches are used to carry information to Tel Aviv. They said  that six Egyptian researchers who cooperated with the Israeli  Academic Center gave Egyptian authorities information and  documents on the center's role and spying activities.    While the United States is trying to contain the crisis  through its Cairo Embassy on the pretext that its escalation  would marginalize the Egyptian role in the peace process,  Egyptian authorities are demanding the removal of the director  of the Israeli Academic Center and an end to Israel's hostile  activities against Egypt.

More  than 30 experts from the economic sector, research and politics  from the entire FRG took part.    The participants expressed themselves very openly, with  criticism and constructiveness, and as complicating conditions  for restructuring the eastern German research landscape they  mentioned:        -  the slim market for research and development work;    -  the great uncertainty about the economic development, which  could last another five to seven years;    -  the barriers to entering the market, which many eastern  German  enterprises must overcome against the established  competition.       The participants in the workshop agreed on the following  recommendations:    1. Industrial research must be retained in its core sectors,  or the process of reindustrialization will be even more delayed.  Industrial research establishments in the new laender need  conditions similar to those of the competing institutions in the  old laender, meaning        -  they need buildings, facilities and real estate;    -  they must be relieved of old encumbrances and old loans;    -  they have claims on equal treatment in the distribution of  research contracts.       2. The governments of the new laender must recognize the  major importance of applied research for the economic  development. They should guarantee proportionate basic or  fundamental financing for efficient RD, in which activity  they  could be guided by the corresponding practice in the old laender.    3. It must be guaranteed that eastern German applicants are  not discriminated against in evaluating project applications. At  present, western Germans dominate in associations and on expert  panels. The chances of experts from the new laender to have a  say should be improved.    4. RD enterprises need a secure financial base in  order to  fully utilize their scope for action. To this end the Trust  Agency should contribute by transferring or conveying property.  Rapid decisions are necessary, primarily for the so-called  research companies.    5. Support for scientific and technical cooperation with  Central and Eastern European countries could open up new demand  for the output of eastern German research institutes.    6. The Working Group of Industrial Research Associations  (AIF) should support activities to found new research  associations and their acceptance as members. The conditions  used so far, which are particularly favorable for project  contracts to RD establishments in the new laender  (""exemption  from self-supplied funding""), should be retained until 1995.    7. The Trust Agency should to a greater extent supply the  industrial RD establishments with guaranteed liquidity  credits.     "

He called for coordinating actions, strengthening unity, and  carrying out all fields of work around the project so as to  foster Suzhou-style efficiency.    Vice Premier Li Lanqing and his entourage arrived at the  lakeside of Lake Jinji in eastern Suzhou, where the Preparatory  Committee for the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative  Committee conducts its business. He heard a briefing on the  park's planning and design. He then braved the rain and arrived  by car at the construction site of a small demonstration zone  developed during the first stage of the industrial park, as well  as the construction site of a road for exclusive use by the  Jiangsu and Shanghai airports, where he inspected progress in  construction work.    In the evening, leading comrades from Jiangsu Province and  Suzhou city briefed Vice Premier Li Lanqing on progress made by  the province and city over the past few months in expeditiously  launching the Suzhou Industrial Park. After hearing the  briefings, Vice Premier Li delivered an important speech.    First, Vice Premier Li Lanqing expressed his satisfaction  with the speed and efficiency with which the Suzhou Industrial  Park had been launched officially in just over two months after  the Chinese and Singaporean Governments officially signed the  relevant agreement. He said: This project is one of  cooperation between the Chinese and Singaporean Governments.  This model of cooperation has never been adopted before; it is  South-South cooperation. The project's success will prove to  the world that South-South cooperation is practical and  feasible. The project represents overall interests. Its  success will also advance reform and opening up in Suzhou, as  well as in Jiangsu and the rest of the country. The Suzhou  Industrial Park's development and construction is a major task  not only for Suzhou but also for Jiangsu and the entire country.  For this reason, central leading comrades, such as General  Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji, are all very concerned about the project. We should  unify our thinking, coordinate our actions, support each other,  strengthen unity, and carry out all fields of work around this  project; we should never compromise our overall interests. Vice  Premier Li emphatically pointed out: A pressing task of the  moment is to do a good job of building the small demonstration  zone. Because the Suzhou Industrial Park's development and  construction is a very complicated task, we must carry out  relevant work carefully and efficiently.    Vice Premier Li Lanqing said: In developing and building the  Suzhou Industrial Park, we should stress both material and  spiritual civilization. We should stress spiritual civilization  in the initial stage of construction. We should uphold  socialist spiritual civilization and should never allow  unhealthy things in. Despite our implementation of a socialist  market economy, we should emphasize spiritual things, such as  the spirit of dedication and the practice of taking pleasure in  helping others. We should not take the market economy to mean  that we can benefit ourselves at the expense of other people and  concern ourselves exclusively with the pursuit of profit.    Vice Premier Li also discussed the issue of learning from  Singapore's experience in economic development and public  administration. He urged the authority in charge of the Suzhou  Industrial Park to explore some experiences that can be promoted  nationwide while taking account of China's realities in  practice. He said: The Suzhou Industrial Park administrative  agency should perform its functions efficiently and in  accordance with laws and regulations, improve the transparency  of its work methods, and foster Suzhou-style efficiency.    In closing, Li Lanqing asked the authority in charge of the  Suzhou Industrial Park to make every effort to open up more  avenues for training skilled personnel. To provide skilled  personnel of various levels for the park's construction, it may  recruit personnel to undergo training in Singapore, ask  Singapore to send people to China to provide training, or  entrust China's institutions of higher learning and vocational  schools to train people with Singapore's assistance. He said  hopefully: To restructure its industry and transform its old  enterprises along with the park's construction, Suzhou should  encourage some technologically advanced enterprises in other  parts of China to set up factories in the park while, at the  same, attracting foreign investment into the park.    Accompanying Vice Premier Li Lanqing on his inspection tour  of the Suzhou Industrial Park were responsible people from  relevant state departments, including Xi Dehua, deputy secretary  general of the State Council; Gan Ziyu, vice chairman of the  State Planning Commission; and Zhao Guanghua, deputy director of  the State Council's Special Economic Zone Office.

Positive vetting of key personnel is being set up for the  first time in the secretariat of the Council of Ministers in  Brussels. The Commission is extending arrangements originally  designed to protect Euratom nuclear secrets.    The moves were disclosed in a letter from Niels Ersboll,  secretary-general of the Council of Ministers, to Alex Falconer,  Labour MEP [Member of European Parliament] for Mid Scotland and  Fife, who led the European Parliament's successful campaign to  fight previous attempts to instigate official secrecy in the  Community.    ""Given its responsibility under the new treaty (of  Maastricht), the Council secretariat will have to deal with  certain classified information (e.g. information relating to the  security policy of member states or information on terrorist  threat) which, as you will understand, necessitates special  precautions to ensure confidentiality and avoid unauthorised  disclosure of material which would seriously damage the security  and interests of member states and their citizens,"" Mr Ersboll  said.    A small number of staff would be ""required to undergo the  security screening which will form part of the proposed security  regime.""    A senior Council official said that positive vetting would  only apply to staff who were given access to sensitive  documents, including security analyses and comments by member  states' diplomatic services on foreign governments.    The vetting will be carried out by the security services of  the individual's own member state or, in the case of foreigners  living in Belgium, by Belgian authorities.    ""The European Union does not itself have the services which  could handle these matters. We are very much in the hands of  the national capitals. They will have to take care of their own  nationals,"" he said.    The Commission is understood to be preparing to increase the  number of offlcials who must be positively vetted before they  can work on the more sensitive parts of common foreign and  security policy, justice and home affairs -- the second and  third pillars of the EU agreed at Maastricht. Hitherto, only a  handful of Commission officials have required positive vetting  by MI5 or other national security services. Routine checks are  carried out at recruitment to ensure that staff have no police  record. But security clearance was only needed for staff with  access to Euratom secrets and a few other sensitive documents.    The Commission's Security Office can handle threats to the  personal safety of commissioners and visiting dignitaries. It  also co-operates with national security services when espionage  charges are made against staff -- such as the current inquiry  into the alleged Stasi connections of a German official in the  Overseas Development Directorate. To add to German  embarrassment, it was revealed yesterday that its ambassador to  Gabon, Rainer Muller, has been arrested as a suspected Stasi spy.    Mr Falconer said he was concerned that a special cadre of  vetted officials was being set up without reference to the  European Parliament, which threw out the Commission's previous  proposals for security vetting of staff.    In 1992 the Commission called for an official secrecy regime  which would have classified its documents ""top secret,"" ""secret""  and ""classified,"" according to their sensitivity. It was forced  to drop the idea by criticism from the MEPs.    Mr Ersboll's letter said the new scheme was much more  limited  in scope. Mr Falconer warned that he could find himself in  conflict with parliament if he did not come clean about what was  being done.     "

Li Tieying, state councillor and member of the  Political Bureau; and Kentaro Kiniwa, deputy director-general of  the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, cut  ribbons and praised the project as a typical example of the  successful cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese  Governments, as well as between the two countries'  entrepreneurial circles.    First Project To Develop Whole Stretch of Land    The Dalian Industrial Park is situated in the Dalian  Economic  and Technological Development Zone. It is the first project in  which Japanese enterprises are developing a whole stretch of  land in China; in fact, it is the first project in which a whole  stretch of land is being developed in Dalian and even in China.  The Chinese side makes up the management committee overseeing  the Dalian Development Zone, and the Japanese side forms the  committee overseeing the projects in the Dalian Industrial Park  (this committee is made up of 22 Japanese enterprises, including  C. Itoh, Mitsubishi, Marubeni Corporation, the Industrial Bank  of Japan, and the Bank of Tokyo). Both sides have established  the joint-venture Dalian Industrial Park Management Company,  which makes a total investment of $65 million, of which the  Chinese side contributes 20 percent and the Japanese side 80  percent. The Chinese side's investment is in the form of the  roads leading to the park, while the Japanese side has  contributed hard currency. The operation period is 50 years,  and the joint-venture company will buy 2.169 square km of land  from the Dalian Development Zone Management Committee for its  use; this land will primarily be transferred to the Japanese  side.    China and Japan Carefully Study Feasibility    The concept of the project was first proposed by the  Japan-China Association for the Development of the Northeast  during its visit to Dalian in February 1988 with the idea of  creating an overseas industrial park for Japan's medium-size and  small enterprises who seek to invest. In 1989, Japan's C. Itoh  Commercial Company, the Bank of Tokyo, and the Marubeni  Corporation expressed their intent of cooperation to the Dalian  Development Zone; in December of the same year, as a result of  the coordination by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade  and Industry, the five establishments of C. Itoh, Marubeni,  Mitsubishi, the Industrial Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Tokyo  formed a close union to establish the Committee Overseeing  Projects in the Dalian Industrial Park and to join forces to  promote the undertaking. Thereafter, the project was upgraded  to an international investment project with active support from  the Japanese Government. The committee inspected the investment  environment in the Dalian Development Zone and carried out  research on related matters, leading to a feasibility report on  the joint development of the Dalian Industrial Park. Hence, the  committee joined hands with 22 influential large companies,  enterprises, and financial institutions in Japan to found Dalian  Industrial Park Company Limited, and former Prime Minister  Takeshita attended the founding ceremony. In early 1992, the  draft of the agreement on developing a whole stretch of land in  Dalian Industrial Park was signed in Tokyo. In 1992, at the  State Council's 101st executive meeting, which was presided over  by Premier Li Peng, the feasibility report on the Dalian  Industrial Park project was discussed and passed. On 5 October  the same year, the official agreement was signed in Beijing, and  Vice Premier Tian Jiyun attended the signing ceremony.    Substantive Progress in Canvassing Businesses and Funds    Since 19 October 1992, projects involving 1.4 million cubic  meters of earth and stone have been completed, 6.5 km of roads  have been built, some pipes and cables have been laid, four  power switching stations have been erected, two heat-suppling  boiler rooms and one heat exchange station have been  constructed, and all are of high quality. The work in  canvassing businesses and funds has also made substantive  progress. More than 300 enterprises specializing in machinery,  electric appliances, chemical industry, and clothing have come  to inspect the area and negotiate contracts, and a large number  of well-known enterprises have come to inspect the projects in  the industrial park, including Yamatake Honeywell Company  Limited, Fuji Electric Company Limited, Toto Limited, and  Konica, which are listed among the ""world's 500 largest  industrial enterprises"" by ""FORTUNE"" magazine. Technologically  advanced companies such as the (Namuko) Company and Takara Shuzo  Company Limited, which are the pioneers in integrated circuit  and genetic engineering, have also come on inspection visits.  Reports have indicated that 27 enterprises have now received  approval to enter the park, and their investments amount to $200  million. Seven of the enterprises have begun work, and it is  estimated that the land allocated for enterprises this year will  reach 60 percent of the total area. Finally, the park is  expected to attract a total of 100 enterprises and over $600  million in investment.     "

A leader of a southern city sighed with regret because  he had not known about the corporation earlier. At a recent  meeting to exchange experience in points selected for  experiments on comprehensive reforms in the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation, convened by the State Commission for  Restructuring Economy, a representative expressed his feelings  as follows: ""A small match (meaning the case of the relocation  of a match factory) has lit up the whole space around.""    We heartily rejoice at such strong repercussions of the  reforms in the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  because, in the course of making reports about the corporation,  we indeed had the feeling of a soft breeze blowing toward us.  However, because the enthusiasm to learn from the Beijing First  Light Industrial Corporation is intensifying, we are worried  that what is learned may be different from what is expected and  that things which should not be stressed, may be stressed.    Our desire and responsibility is to help our readers  correctly understand and grasp this typical example.    The focus of the reforms carried out by the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation is not to enliven the  enterprises but to enliven the assets. The corporation has  pushed reforms a big step forward and such reforms mark the  raising of the curtain of a new stage in the reforms of  enterprises.    ""If I were the boss, what I should consider at present would  be how to enliven all the assets instead of how to save each  individual enterprise,"" said Zhou Dali, deputy director of the  State Commission for Restructuring Economy Distribution  Department, at an informal discussion meeting. ""How should we  change the situation of three one-thirds in state enterprises?  If we concentrate our efforts on saving each individual  enterprise, all enterprises will be half dead. Assets must be  current assets. This is an essential demand of the market  economy. Some enterprises must survive while others must perish  and the disposal of resources should be optimized in the course  of readjusting the structure and layout. Only by enlivening  state assets will it be possible to enliven the overall  situation.""    The shift of the focus from enlivening enterprises to  enlivening assets is a new change and a new demand of reform of  the economic structure. It is also something that makes the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation so prominent. Of  course, this does not mean enlivening enterprises is  unimportant. Enlivening enterprises is the foundation. How can  we enliven assets without enlivening enterprises? However,  enlivening assets is the goal. To attain this goal, some  enterprises which should survive should be allowed to live on  happily, while other enterprises which should perish should be  allowed to die a ""natural and unrestrained death [xiao sa si yi  hui 3469 3155 2984 0001 2585].""    ""Enlivening assets is different from enlivening  enterprises,""  said Li Yuan, director of the State Commission of Restructuring  Economy Distribution Department. ""First of all, in enlivening  enterprises, impetus is often required only once. Such impetus  can be a policy, funds, or technology and if it can last three  to five years, it will be good enough. However, the enlivening  of assets needs a long-term effective mechanism and the  formation of such a mechanism is based on the construction of  systems. Second, the enlivening of assets needs comprehensive  reforms. In the reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation for example, the solutions to the two  major difficult problems regarding the sources of funds and the  placement of surplus personnel must involve the reforms of  various systems, such as the land use system, the personnel and  labor system, the system for training staff members and workers,  and the social security system. Third, since the reforms are  comprehensive, a new role is needed. The person who plays this  role should undertake responsibility for state assets and should  be able to manage state assets with a free hand, in accordance  with the laws of the market economy, in a bid to preserve their  value. However, such a new role should be established through  reforming the enterprise property rights system.""    Bai Jinrong, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal  Committee for Restructuring Economy said: ""The existing  enterprise systems cannot meet the demands of the market economy  on enterprises--to become competitive main bodies which raise  funds on their own, carry out construction and operation on  their own, and assume sole responsibility for their profits and  losses. Nor can they meet the needs of large-scale socialized  production--assets to float and disposal of resources to be  optimized. In carrying out reforms of enterprises in the past,  we always focused our attention on the relationships of  production. However, the universal significance of the reforms  carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  lies in the new path it has explored for enlivening the state  economy--the organic integration, through comprehensive reforms,  of the readjustment of the production setup, the enterprise  organizational setup, the layout of industries, the  transformation of the old urban areas, and the development of  the land resources with the reform of the enterprise property  rights system, with the goal of establishing a modern enterprise  system to realize the unity of the readjustment of the  production relationships with the development of the productive  forces. That is, the unity of reform and development, as we  usually put it.""    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation shifted from  the management of production and enterprises to the operation  and management of state assets. Ever since then, the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation has lost its original meaning  and like ""Yiqing"" and ""Fazhan,"" has become a code name for large  enterprise groups with assets of several billion yuan.    If you agree with the above views, do you accept the  following judgment? The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Committee put forward the establishment of a modern enterprise  system and this enabled the reforms of enterprises in our  country to enter a new stage. With the intensive work carried  out for some time, the curtain of this new stage has been raised  and the opera has started.    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has been  able to carry out operational activities to enliven state assets  thanks to the reform of the enterprise property rights system.  Through authorized management of state assets, the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation has acquired the status of  the representative of the proprietor of assets and, therefore,  can handle affairs which a single production enterprise could  not handle and which government departments should not  handle.    Although there are different views on the comprehensive  reforms of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, we  hold that the sequence of ideas is very clear: The point of  integration of deepening reforms in enterprises with the  development of the productive forces is to enliven assets; in  the market economy structure, enterprise actions should be  dominant ones in enlivening assets; and we must reform the  existing enterprise system, otherwise the property rights  relationship will not be clear and enterprises will find it  difficult to fulfill this task.    Cui Zhian, chairman of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation board of directors, recalled the formulation of the  train of thought on reforms, saying: ""Our new exploration of  reform began in 1991 and the train of thought was really  formulated after Comrade Xiaoping made his remarks in the south  in 1992. The remarks about being beneficial to promoting the  productive forces, beneficial to reinforcing the comprehensive  national strength of our socialist country, and beneficial to  enhancing the living standards of the people have enlightened us  a great deal and have become the ideological weapon for us to  deepen reform. We conducted investigations and made analyses of  our own position and discovered that we were in a very difficult  situation. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  mainly produced daily necessities and any other enterprise could  also do that. Besides, preferential policies were implemented  for joint ventures, township and town enterprises, and open  areas, but we were under the impact of contraband. We had no  strong points at all. What was the way out? We summed up the  experience of reforms carried out in some of our enterprises and  our train of thought became clearer. In the past, the  consumption rate of the No. 3 Glass Plant was great and its  products were of lower grade. After it was moved to Daxing  County and became a joint venture, it introduced advanced  technology and produced high-grade glass products. The price  for each tonne of glass products rose from 1,200 yuan to 8,000  yuan. Then came the lighting device plant which had been a  loss-making plant for many years. After it used the building of  a branch plant to do business, it was able to give jobs to over  100 surplus personnel and to bring in an additional income of 3  million yuan. It was most profitable to develop tertiary  industry in prosperous areas and everybody was able to see that.  The idea of relocating secondary industry enterprises and  developing tertiary industry enterprises, and of moving  production factors out of the Fourth Ring Road to develop  secondary industry at a high level was put forward on this basis.    ""At present, state enterprises commonly face three  difficulties: Funds are in short supply, personnel are  excessive, and assets cannot be enlivened,"" said Cui Zhian.  ""Viewed from the reality of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation, the last of the three difficulties was the crux and  once this knot was untied, the other difficulties could be  overcome. Once the assets were enlivened, there would be money  and more jobs could be provided for the surplus personnel. How  could this knot be untied? We must have the right to operate  assets. To whom should the rights to operate assets be given?  Should they be given to a certain production enterprise? Given  the difficult situation the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation was in, it would not make things any better no  matter which production enterprise was given the right to  operate assets. Should such rights be given to government  departments? But government departments cannot take part in  operational activities. What should we do then? The only thing  for us to do was to change ourselves and shoulder the task.""    ""Unclear property rights relationships are the root cause of  the poor operation of state enterprises,"" said Li Yuan. ""To  solve this problem, the idea of separating the two rights, that  is, separating ownership rights from the rights of operation,  was once put forward in carrying out reforms in the past. This  played a great role in ensuring the right to make decisions on  the operation of enterprises. However, since the state was the  proprietor and the enterprises were operators, it was still  difficult to separate the government from enterprises. The crux  of the problem was to find an appropriate position for the  proprietor in enterprises. Through authorized rights to operate  state assets, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  acquired the status as the representative of the proprietor.  This shows that separating government from assets is an  important condition for separating government from enterprises.""    To enliven assets, we must establish a property rights main  body. The ultimate ownership of state assets belongs to the  state and enterprises only have legal person property rights.  Who then should exercise ownership of assets on behalf of the  state and undertake the responsibility of preserving and  increasing the value of such assets? The Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation has provided us with a train of thought.    The reforms by the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation have both universal and special significance. The  reforms by the corporation have been carried out on the basis of  its own reality. In learning from the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation, we should also proceed from our  respective realities.    There are two direct reasons for the success in the reforms  of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation: The right to  operate state assets and the right to develop land resources.  However, these two cannot be equated with the reform of the  property rights system and the construction of the modern  enterprise system.    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has found its  own position in reform. It has changed from an organization for  the management of a trade into a company of an enterprise nature  for the operation of state assets. ""Can we also do the same?""  This is perhaps the most directly associated thought in some  administrative departments.    Speaking about this question, Li Yuan said, ""Where this new  role can be played should be based on the characteristics of the  respective specific situations and productive forces. In a big  city like Beijing, for example, if such a role is played at a  level higher than the original specialized administrative  department, the range of administration will be too wide. In a  small city, it is perhaps more appropriate for one or two  companies to play this role. Another idea is for the role to be  played by a single production enterprise but this has to be  determined by the scale and capacity of that enterprise. In the  Beijing light industry system, if the role is played by a  certain production enterprise, that enterprise can be enlivened.  However, the role of enlivening state assets of the entire  system will be greatly reduced.""    ""What is more important,"" stressed Li Yuan, ""is to select  the  player of this `new role.' We must take into consideration its  quality and ability, including its sense of reform, its  comprehensive ability, and its operational capacity. Before it  was authorized to operate state assets, the leadership of the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation had already made  numerous attempts at reform. Under difficult conditions, it  constantly optimized the disposal of the production factors and  achieved initial results and valuable experience. Therefore, if  we want to follow its example we should act in the same way and  learn from them properly.""    Whenever comrades of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation talk about the reforms they carried out, they never  forget the support of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and  Municipal Government and the guidance from the State Commission  for Restructuring Economy. In fact, the reforms in the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation have been carried out ahead  of time. It is precisely because of this that some practices are  not completely in keeping with certain existing rules,  regulations, and policies. The Beijing CPC Municipal CPC  Committee and Municipal Government, from the angle of carrying  out experiments boldly, have given special treatment to the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. The right to  comprehensively develop real estate within the system, for  example, has been granted specially.    According to a comrade from the Beijing Municipal Committee  for Restructuring Economy, land is a state asset. The use of  land has to be compensated and has a time limit. The  responsibility for land management is undertaken by special  government departments and specific work is carried out by local  governments. Taxes and fees collected are used for urban  construction. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  has changed the purpose in using land. According to regulations,  the land should be taken back, new applications should be  submitted for examination and approval, and taxes and fees  concerned should be paid. In this respect, there is no  exception for the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation.  However, the municipal government has adopted some relatively  lax policies and flexible practices in the relocation of  enterprises. For example, the amount of money to be handed over  to the state for the sale of land can be handed over by  installments and part of the money can be returned to the  enterprises as reinvestment by the state. In redeveloping the  land originally occupied by the Beijing Match Plant, the land  was converted into 47 million state shares in the Hongyun  Company. At present, the value of this part of the state assets  has increased by 200 percent. In this way, the reforms of the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation acquired the  necessary means and funds for the start. Therefore, in this  sense, it can be said that the attempt to reform the system of  using land has benefited the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation and the credit should go to the municipal  government. This is precisely a concrete action of ""supporting  reform with reform"" put forward by the Beijing Municipality.    Li Yuan holds that the reform of the land use system  centering round the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation  carried out by the Beijing Municipality can meet the needs of  the market economy and has not changed the nature whereby land  belongs to the state. Compared with various practices of using  land to attract foreign capital in some localities and giving  preferential treatment to foreign businessmen and allowing them  to have more profits, the method adopted by the Beijing  Municipality is more normal. The merit of this practice is that  it has demonstrated the value of land assets and has prevented  the loss of land assets. However, the land use system is an  important state system and we should safeguard its solemnity and  authority. Reforms must be carried out in an orderly way, step  by step, and under the guidance of the government departments  concerned.    We should not just focus our attention on land in optimizing  the disposal of resources but should also pay attention to  management, technology, equipment, qualified personnel, and the  ways of combining various production factors. In Beijing,  because differential land rent exists, land resources are very  important. This may not be so in other localities. The reforms  of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation have been  carried out on the basis of its reality. In learning from the  corporation, we should also proceed from our respective  realities.     "

On February 22, the U.S. Government instituted judicial  proceedings against Aldrich Hazen Ames, the former chief of the  CIA's Soviet counter-intelligence branch, and his wife Maria,  charging them with spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia.    Three days later, the U.S. Government expelled a Russian  diplomat from the Russian Embassy in Washington.    It's widely believed that the incident will have a major  impact on Russian-U.S. relations.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher personally handed  an statement of protest to the Russian Embassy in Washington,  declaring that the U.S. could not tolerate Russia installing  spies in its country and describing the incident as a very  serious matter.    Commenting on the case, U.S. President Bill Clinton  suggested  that as a result the U.S. will completely re-evaluate its  foreign policy toward Russia. Many senators in the U.S.  Congress insisted that amendments should be attached to policies  on aid to Russia.    In the last two years, the United States and Russia have  been  seeking a strategic partnership in their relations. In January  their presidents met in Moscow and signed a declaration  announcing that the two countries had entered a stage of  ""strategic partnership"".    However, there are still contradictions and differences  between the two countries on matters of vital interests.    Russia has always claimed that it has ""special interests and  responsibilities"" in the new republics which have emerged in the  territories of the former Soviet Union. Russia has taken it for  granted that it has the right to send its peace keeping troops  into these republics and has taken economic measures to  safeguard its interests in them.    Meanwhile, the United States has been using the carrot of  economic aid to various republics and countries in the area as a  means of containing Russia's influence.    The United States, for example, has supported the three  Baltic republics in their request for the withdrawal of Russian  troops and has offered more economic aid for the Ukraine. It  also signed an accord of ""democratic partnership"" with  Kazakhstan.    Observers here consider that the proposed U.S. plan for  expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),  which it has described as a ""partnership for peace"", poses a  threat to Russian interests in East European countries where it  previously had traditional influence.    So far, the Russian Government has kept a tight rein on its  response to the U.S. spy allegations. The Russian intelligence  agency has also kept silent, despite Russia's known displeasure  about the U.S. decision to publicly announce the allegations and  the charges without consulting it in advance.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in a statement  last Thursday [24 February] that the Ames issue should not be  placed at the top of the Russian-U.S. relations agenda.    Kozyrev said he believed that the issue won't set back the  hopes for a partnership for peace between Russia and the United  States. The Foreign Ministry also expressed its hope that the  issue could be settled before the political and diplomatic  interests of both countries were put in jeopardy.    Sources from Russian intelligence agencies here said they  were bewildered by the dramatizing of the spy issue on the part  of their American colleagues and the U.S. Government.    An official with the Russian intelligence agency said in an  informal talk that spies from the U.S. are also active on  Russian territory and hence the Ames issue should be tackled  within a framework drawn up between the intelligence agencies of  the two countries.    However, press commentators in Moscow are convinced that the  uproar in the U.S. about the issue will have an adverse effect  on the future development of the relations between the two  countries. They believe that the approach now used by the two  sides to calm down the row will, to some degree, dictate where  their bilateral relations will head for.     "

The corporation's  reforms and exploration are still in progress and its experience  is only preliminary. The main reason for a series of reports to  be published on it is that we want the reading public to more  thoroughly understand the basic train of thought of the  corporation's reform. It would never be our aim to encourage  everyone simply to copy the corporation without paying any  attention to his own conditions, neither do we intend to  popularize the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as a  so-called ""model."" Since different localities have different  conditions, the exploration of reform can be and should be  varied, but a common point of departure must be grasped firmly,  which is to develop and strengthen the state-owned economy and  to ensure that the value of state-owned assets can be maintained  and increased. This is also the basic point of the reform  experience of Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation.    Once the train of thought of reform is determined, concrete  work must be done in a safe and discreet manner. Strategic  considerations are not tantamount to tactical operations.  Negative effects may be brought about if one stresses only good  wishes while doing one's work, but disregards the peculiarities  of the time and the situation. For example, we can never take  the flexible use of assets as simply the reorientation of land  use; neither can we set off another upsurge of real estate  development in the name of learning from the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation. State-owned assets cover a very wide  range, and land is only a very small part.    Shortage of funds, overabundance of personnel, and rigid  asset application are the three problems generally being  encountered by state-owned enterprises at present. Under the  guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's southern-tour remarks and the  spirit of the 14th Party Congress, the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation proceeded from reality to blaze a new  trail of comprehensive reforms in asset appreciation,  transformation of industries, transformation of functions,  transformation of the mechanism, and transfer of workers and  staff to other work units, thus finding the key to solving these  three problems.    According to comrades of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation, rigid asset application is the knot of the three  problems, and the others can be solved readily once this knot is  untied. Therefore, although many aspects are involved in the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation's reform, the  enterprise ownership reform remains its nucleus.    How did they untie the knot? What kind of key did they find?  We will publish four reports to answer these questions one by  one. Our reporters still found it interesting to address the  issue after finishing four reports on it. Hence, we will  publish a fifth report, in which the reporter and people  concerned will speak on what we actually get from the reforms  carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation.  Of course, the reading public is very welcome to discuss this  with us. [end editor's note]    ""The starting point of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation is not a premeditated scheme, but practice. Up to  now, they have taken an entirely step-by-step approach to work.""    -- Opening remarks made by a comrade of the Beijing First  Light Industrial Corporation who was familiar with the whole  process of systematic reform    In a football game, ""offside"" means breaking the rules.  In order to find a way out for the enterprise, the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation was unconsciously on the  ""offside""--turning its attention from dealing with products to  dealing with state-owned assets. A fortuitous ""offside"" made an  impact on the whole system.    State-owned enterprises abstain from talking about ""death,""  and so did the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation.  Although the Bankruptcy Law was introduced several years ago,  and the idea of ""euthanasia"" is accepted by more and more  people, after all, owing to environmental limitations, only a  few enterprises have resorted to ""euthanasia."" Many enterprises  originally thinking of an ""easy death"" often give up the idea  because they ""cannot bear such a death"" and they are still  bitterly fighting for their ""mere existence.""    To our surprise, however, the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation miraculously and quietly ""died"" in the past two  years or so, without causing any sloppiness or trouble.    The first case in point was the former Beijing No. 2  Eyeglasses Plant. From 1984 on, faced with increasingly fierce  market competition, the plant failed again and again. In 1991,  the capacity utilization rate was less than 30 percent, the  annual per capita income of workers and staff was a mere 2,400  yuan, and the plant's deficits accumulated to 1.2 million yuan.  At the same time, hundreds of individual household traders  emerged around there who were running eyeglasses industries and  processing eyeglasses, and their business was good. After  conscientiously weighing the pros and cons, the plant decided to  ""transfer"" from the ""secondary industry"" to ""tertiary industry.""  With the support of industrial and commercial departments, in  August 1991, the Beijing No. 2 Eyeglasses Plant was transformed  into a specialized eyeglasses wholesale market with over 500  stalls, which attracted not only numerous individual household  traders in the area, but foreign businessmen as well. The  annual turnover reached 130 million yuan, which not only offset  the enterprise's deficits, but reaped more than 1 million yuan  of profits. Former staff and workers changed their occupations  and acted as security guards, cleaners, and transport personnel,  and the annual per capita income almost doubled. Last year, the  Beijing No. 1 Eyeglasses Plant -- an ""associate"" of the Beijing  No. 2 Eyeglasses Plant which also was running in the red -- was  incorporated into the eyeglasses market. The largest eyeglasses  center in our country will be built here.    The second case was that of the No. 1 Branch Factory of  the Beijing Lighting Equipment Company. From 1988 onward, this  factory -- which produced traditional lamps for civilian,  industrial, and mining use -- was in a predicament. In 1991, it  incurred more than 500,000 yuan in deficits. The company took  notice of the superiority of the No. 1 Branch Factory's  location, in the bustling Xizhimen section, and decided to  rebuild it into a commercial building that would specialize in  selling communications equipment. In August 1992, the building  opened for business. Although it was owned by the state, the  business was privately run and contracted by staff and workers.  In consequence, it reaped 160,000 yuan in profits in 1992 and  over 2 million yuan the following year.    The third case was that of the Beijing Lamp Factory. Owing  to its running in the red and incurring debts year after year,  the factory was incorporated into the Xinhai Instrument Company  in September 1992. The lamp factory's former main production  building was rebuilt into the Caishikou Xinguang Commercial  Building, of which some floors were leased, while some others  were used by the company for sales of instruments and lamps.  Last year, the commercial building reaped more than 700,000  yuan in profits and the income of staff and workers increased by  over 40 percent. Most of the staff and workers were transferred  to a piano plant that was short of labor. In consequence, the  piano plant was able quickly to expand its scale of production  and increase its output, profits, and taxes.    Viewed from the product angle, these factories -- as  enterprises manufacturing certain kinds of light industrial  products -- really are ""dead,"" and they have been removed from  the ""roll"" of secondary industry. Viewed from the enterprise  angle, they are still open for business, and their staff and  workers are still working and being paid because, even though  the ""secondary industry"" is dead, the ""tertiary industry"" was  born. Viewed from the angle of assets, state-owned assets --  which are created by state investment -- are neither dead nor  lost, but reinvigorated with their value greatly increased!    All these things are neither readjustment of the product  structure nor simply industrial transformation, but indicate a  kind of change in nature -- breaking through the barriers of  products and industries, and achieving a transformation from the  running of a certain kind of products to the running of  state-owned assets. Although the transformation was started  unconsciously and at a time when the goal of socialist market  economic reform had not been clearly fixed, real actions were  taken, and they have successfully redistributed resources while  standing in the commanding position of running the main body of  assets and following the market course.    This kind of unconscious ""offside"" practice has not only  reshaped the enterprises' external images and transformed their  internal mechanism, but more important, has had a huge impact on  the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as a whole.    An ""offside"" is often the starting point of reform.  When people are aware of the fact that an ""offside"" precisely  fills the ""gap"" of owners (representatives) of state-owned  assets, ""filling the gap"" will become a strong voluntary  demand.    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, which was  formed and departmentalized according to product categories  during the planned-economy period, once scored brilliant  achievements. Not to mention the ""three renowned pieces"" --  watches, bicycles, and sewing machines -- which were popular,  personnel of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation are  really proud of the fact that the ""Beibingyang"" soft drink and  ""Hongxing"" sorghum spirits monopolized the capital's market for  a long time.    After the policy of reform and opening up was started,  however, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation came  across the problems generally encountered by state-owned  enterprises. Moreover, the corporation was faced with more and  more special problems: Small production scale, obsolete  equipment, overabundance of personnel, and low-technology  products. In consequence, the corporation failed again and  again because it could hardly adapt itself to the intense market  competition. The most distressing problem was that owing to the  expansion of urban districts, many factories that lay between  residential and commercial districts became annoyances and were  urgently required to move elsewhere. However, there simply was  no way to raise 1.5 billion yuan for moving expenses. Up to the  early 1990's, 30 percent of the more than 120 enterprises under  the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation were in the red,  and products manufactured by over 35 percent of these  enterprises were unsalable. From 1990 to 1992, the whole  corporation earned fewer and fewer profits, which dropped from  110 million yuan to 90 million yuan and then to just over 60  million yuan.    As a matter of fact, like all other state-owned enterprises  in the last decade or so, the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation also made constant progress by following the general  trend of reform. It delegated power to lower levels and let  them retain a proportion of profits, changed profits into taxes,  implemented the contract responsibility system, and put the  Regulations into effect, without missing any single link. All  of these reforms played a positive part in promoting the  development of the enterprises, and a small number of the  enterprises still were faring quite well. We should say that  without implementing these reform measures, the Beijing First  Light Industrial Corporation certainly would have encountered  many more difficulties than it did. As far as the whole body is  concerned, however, the situation of the Beijing First Light  Industrial Corporation was becoming more and more grimm. By  drawing on the experience of coastal areas and by  conscientiously analyzing the situation of the enterprises under  the corporation after Comrade Xiaoping had made his  southern-tour remarks in 1992, the decision-makers at the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation concluded:  Objectively speaking, the corporation was being surrounded by  five ""circles"" -- joint-venture enterprises, town and township  enterprises, enterprises in special economic zones, civilian-run  enterprises, and import goods -- and subjectively speaking, the  corporation was still fettered by five shackles -- the petty  production concept, the influence of ""leftist"" ideology, the  sluggish transformation of government functions, the ossified  administrative system, and an inflexible operational mechanism.  In addition, the corporation bore three heavy burdens  --overabundance of personnel, shortage of funds, and  difficulties in making an inventory of assets.    Where does the crux of this situation lie? -- Sluggish  reform. A vertical view shows that in the past, the Beijing  First Light Industrial Corporation based its reform primarily on  improving a single type of product, to the benefit of a single  enterprise, but nothing was done explicitly to set a goal for  preserving and heightening the value of state-owned assets.  Moreover, its enterprises did not have the right to manage the  assets and they need not and could not flexibly distribute  resources within a wider scope in light of changes in market  demand, hence its enterprises could not sustain deficits once  incurred. As far as the ultimate ownership is concerned, the  assets of these enterprises belong to the state, a fact that is  never ambiguous, but in reality, it is very difficult for the  state to be concretely in charge of each of the enterprises,  thus giving rise to the phenomenon of a ""gap"" in the main body  of ownership. Filling the ""gap"" has become a task of paramount  importance in deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises.  One of the important factors accounting for stronger vitality  of joint-venture, private, and stockholding enterprises is  precisely the availability of ownership representatives, and  basically, the nonexistence of the nominal post of ""person-in  charge."" A lateral view shows that past reform attached  importance to making a breakthrough in a single area while  neglecting the importance of promoting corresponding progress in  other areas, hence the short-term effect was prominent, but  after some time, the effect gradually faded and the reform was  subject to various limitations. The market is ruthless, and  market competition at present is, in reality, a competition of  reform. Anyone who is sluggish in reform will become passive  and may be thrown out of the market, which is developing at a  high speed! This is the truth proven by innumerable facts.    Reform must be deepened vigorously! Reform must be  promoted in a comprehensive manner! At a moment when its fate  hung in the balance, the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation had no retreat, but could only make this choice.  How to make things work, however, is a very realistic  problem.    Some people suggested that the 120 or so enterprises could  part company with each other and each seek its own way out.  However, as proven by practice, this method will not work.  Some enterprises can ""fight their way out of the heavy  encirclement,"" but owing to different bases and qualities, a  considerable number of enterprises still, just as in the past  several years, will be in a state of not knowing whether they  can survive or not, and it is inevitable that they will blindly  readjust their structure, thus causing great losses to the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, which is a  state-owned asset. As far as comprehensive reform is concerned,  it is impossible for any single enterprise to accomplish it.  Not to mention other problems, under the present circumstances  in which the social security system is not yet perfect, the mere  existence of several tens of thousands of personnel seeking  reemployment and over 20,000 retired staff and workers is  sufficient to have quite a large impact on social stability.    Could all the work be handled and administered entirely by  the municipal government? Such a practice does not accord with  the reform orientation of separating the functions and  responsibilities of administration from those of management, and  in reality, this will not work. In the past several decades,  the government has played a role of chief factory director  bearing ""unlimited responsibilities."" The conclusion was  reached long ago in history: Facing the volatile market and tens  of thousands of enterprises, the government cannot and does not  have the strength to handle all the work.    The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, with  billions  in state-owned assets, had an urgent need for a genuine  ""person-in-charge,"" and the corporation's more than 100  enterprises were eager to have an ""operator"" to coordinate their  comprehensive reform. It was precisely under such circumstances  that a new role mounted the great stage of the market economy,  and the first company in Beijing for the management of  state-owned assets -- the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation -- emerged as required by the times!

An organ of the Industrial Structure Council, an advisory  body to the international trade and industry minister, held its  first meeting to prepare a set of industrial rules for  protecting the earth's environment in such areas as industrial  wastes and chemical pollutants such as carbon dioxide emissions.    A report to be announced in early June will address the  importance of sector-by-sector responsibility by Japanese  businesses for the disposal of harmful chemicals and byproducts  throughout all stages of business activities from materials  purchases to manufacturing, distribution and the end-use of  products, ministry officials said.    The report will also call for businesses to establish  technologies to enable secondary use of both industrial and  household waste.    The panel will hold three more meetings before releasing the  report entitled, ``An Industrial Vision of the Environment,'' on  8 June.     "

NEDO will  use experimental facilities that produce a phenomenon in which a  micro-gravity environment, like that in outer space, is obtained  when objects fall naturally, and will elucidate the basic  mechanisms of combustion to design the high-performance  industrial furnace and boiler. NEDO will receive grants from  MITI and plans to invest 5 billion in a seven-year effort  starting this fiscal year. The goals are to improve upon the  thermal efficiency of present-day industrial furnaces and  boilers by 30% and 5%, respectively.    Heating furnaces, heat-processing furnaces, aluminum-melting  furnaces, and other such industrial furnaces used today account  for about 15% of the total energy consumption in Japan.  Reducing that energy consumption is also viewed as important  from the standpoint of preventing global warming. On the other  hand, there has come to be brisk research into the details of  combustion in micro-gravity environments, where buoyancy and  convection effects are not felt. Consequently, NEDO decided to  build upon these new research results and develop methods for  increasing combustion efficiency and reducing harmful exhaust  gases by controlling the state of the flame within the furnace.    The Japan Space Utilization Promotion Center will be  commissioned to conduct basic experiments on combustion  phenomena and to develop the control technology. In addition to  the Hokkaido Kami-sunagawa-machi drop-test facility operated by  the third-sector Underground Zero-Gravity Experimental Center  (Sapporo City), NEDO will use Bremen University's drop tower in  Germany, and France's system that uses airplanes for  zero-gravity environment experiments. NEDO will also exchange  information on research results.    The Japan Industrial Furnace Society and the Japan Society  of  Industrial Machinery Manufacturers will be commissioned to  develop a test furnace and evaluate its performance. If the  industrial furnace becomes practical and goes into widespread  use, a rough calculation shows that it will bring about a  5%  reduction in Japan's total energy consumption.     "

He also made a steadfast commitment to  implement the arrest warrants issued for the members of the  Tijuana Cartel, including the brothers Benjamin, Ramon, and  Javier Arellano Felix, thereby to eliminate one of the most  powerful rings engaged in drug trafficking.    The nation's attorney general declared: ""We shall continue  to  intensify our unrestricted battle against organized crime,  particularly the drug traffic; because this battle is for the  health of our children and youth, and for the nation."" He  provided details on the capture of Francisco Rafael Arellano  Felix, who is now confined in the maximum security federal  prison at Almoloya de Juarez, in Mexico State. [passage omitted]    Carpizo MacGregor revealed that the institution, backed by  the society, the National Institute to Combat Drugs, and even  international authorities, is conducting ""an extensive  investigation to locate and apprehend those who are now  fugitives from justice.""    Describing the capture of the oldest Arellano Felix brother  as a victory for Mexico, he claimed that the war against the  drug trade can be won only if the government and society act  together. He noted that such cooperation, through anonymous  reports, contributed greatly to that operation, during which  Luis Enrique Cortes Zatarain, Tomas Adan Velarde Espinosa,  Benjamin de la Pena Farias, and Diego Gonzalez Martinez were  captured as well. [passage omitted]    The assistant attorney for branch agencies and inspection,  Mario Ruiz Massieu, in turn, explained: ""Arellano Felix had been  subject to three previous criminal suits: in 1978, with his  wife, for crimes against health; again in 1988, for the same  crimes; and a year later, for carrying a weapon reserved  exclusively for use by the armed forces."" He added that, in all  three instances, the subject managed to evade the action of the  courts, because one of the orders for his formal imprisonment  was revoked and, on another occasion, the case records were  lost. Despite this, the accused himself declared that he had  been acquitted by a federal judge in Tijuana.    In the assistant attorney's opinion, Ramon, Javier, and  Benjamin Arellano Felix are the heads of the so-called ""Tijuana  Cartel."" He said that the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of  the Republic] has now fully identified the members of that  family who, although not directly linked with the drug traffic,  have been aiding their relatives in money laundering and in  managing the enormous fortune that they possess. [passage  omitted]    Espionage Team To Learn Police Action    During this investigation, culminating in the capture of one  of the Arellanos, it was discovered from the seizures made of  communications equipment and systems that the drug traffickers  had been following the activity, not only of the municipal and  state police, but also of the federal force, step by step, using  monitors.    Their equipment, of the most sophisticated type, besides  tapping phone calls anywhere in the country, also managed to  enter the authorities' restricted frequencies. In this way, the  traffickers were learning first-hand about the action being  planned against them.    Ruiz Massieu commented: ""Through this discovery, it has been  proven that drug traffickers listen to and tape conversations of  PGR public servants. There is further evidence of this in the  case of several employees of the newspaper EL MANANA, in  Reynosa, Tamaulipas, who were remanded, and in the case  involving the Ochoa Bali Hai restaurant. In the confiscated  vehicles, cassettes with tapes of our officials' conversations  were discovered, and some of the spies even attempted to imitate  their voices.""    He remarked that, in view of this situation, the authorities  have changed the codes and frequencies used by the PJF [Federal  Judicial Police]. [passage omitted]    Ruiz Massieu added that the exhaustive investigation of the  Arellano Felix brothers, presumed to be the material  perpetrators of the murder of Cardinal Jose Jesus Posadas Ocampo  and of six other persons, has made it possible to capture and  remand scores of members of various drug cartels. He commented:  ""At the time of his arrest, in order to procure his release,  Francisco Rafael attempted to bribe the police agents with  $100,000. As a result, he was also remanded for the crime of  bribery in the degree of an attempt."" [passage omitted]     "

The  report recommends assignment of the highest priority to the  building of ""research and development infrastructure"" projects  such as data networks and data bases. It also lists as future  development issues nine sectors such as data communications and  energy and environmental technology.    The guide identifies as important construction of technical  infrastructure for MITI-sponsored national projects and  Industrial Technology Institute-sponsored research and  development project-related data networks and data bases and  standards. Additionally, it recommends priority implementation  of work in three sectors: 1) reinforcement of basic and creative  research; 2) response to global and international issues such as  the environment; and 3) research and development that aims at  the enhancement of the public living standards and welfare.    In the way of research and development organizations, the  report recommends that the 15 national research agencies  supervised by the Industrial Technology Institute be treated as  the core organizations for experimentation (COE). It also points  to the need to expand programs such as tax systems and fiscal  investment and loan programs to assist in research and  development work of the private sector.     "

The existing standards, which were created from the  viewpoint of manufacturers and suppliers, will incorporate with  the objective of promoting products that are kind to the elderly  and environment. The new long-term plan will be completed by the  summer of 1995 and will be the focus of ""The 8th Industrial  Standardization Promotion Project"" which will start in fiscal  1996.    The Japan Industrial Standards Investigation Committee  (JISC)  (Kozo Iizuka, acting chairman), which is the JIS consulting  organ, soon will set up a special subcommittee for establishment  of the new program and begin specific deliberations. The  subcommittee will review details of existing standards and how  they are defined with an eye toward the arrival of an aging  society and a growing awareness of environmental preservation  will deliberate on the creation of domestic standards that are  consistent with international standards, and compile proposals  by next year.    Consumer goods such as daily necessities account for about  20  percent of JIS certified products, but many of the existing  standards were created for quality control and to reduce costs  on the manufacturer's side, and there often has been criticism  that they lack consideration for consumer protection. For this  reason, the JISC is proceeding withits review of standards by  revising JIS definition guidelines to include considerations for  the elderlyp.     "

He was summoned to answer  questions regarding accusations of espionage against certain  public personalities as well as with changes at the SRI  leadership. Although the Steering College of the respective  institution was also summoned, Virgil Magureanu was accompanied  only by the head of the Counterespionage Directorate.    The most spectacular case, that is, the case of the former  presidential counselor, Marin Pancea, was clarified with two  precise answers: He is neither a French spy nor working for the  KGB. Asked whether he was not interested in Pancea's commercial  relations, which would have made him a suspect, Virgil Magureanu  said that SRI did not react to this issue. The SRI director  promised to disclose next week where all the information  published in the press originated from.    In connection with other personalities who were accused of  espionage such as Adrian Nastase [executive president of the  ruling party Social Democracy Party of Romania], Adrian Severin  [vice president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation  Front)], Ion Talpes [head of the Foreign Intelligence Service],  and others, the answer was the same, namely, he promised to  disclose those things later. In any event, ""there is no proof  that those persons were spies."" Nevertheless, the SRI director  promised ""we will also see some spies"" without mentioning who  they are, how they were discovered, and what has happened to  them.    Major General Dumitru Cristea, Deputy Chief of the SRI, Will  Be Removed From Office on Grounds of Immoral Behavior    Referring to the issue of demotions at the level of the SRI  leadership, Virgil Magureanu said that his deputy, Major General  Dumitru Cristea, will be removed from his position because of  immoral and scandalous behavior. In his capacity as rector of  the Higher Institute for Information Studies, he had sexual  relations with female students and the father of one of the  girls complained about it to the Parliamentary Commission. The  Commission came into possession of a recorded cassette that  contained the declarations made to the Commission expert by the  respective student. In her statement, the student tells the  entire story in detail. Out of decency, we decided to refrain  from disclosing those details. However, the representatives of  the commission assessed the behavior of the SRI deputy chief as  ""offensively immoral.""    The president of the Parliamentary Commission Vasile Vacaru  also has a recording in which Dumitru Cristea admits all the  allegations, even if he withdrew those statements later.    In this situation, Major General Dumitru Cristea was  summoned  for a hearing to the Parliamentary Commission in Charge of  Supervising Romanian Intelligence Service activity.    SRI Has No Clear Picture About Documents That Were Concealed  by Gheorghe Diaconescu and That Contain Intelligence Data    In connection with the dismissal of the head of the  Counterintelligence Service, Gheorghe Diaconescu, Virgil  Magureanu informed the commission that Diaconescu concealed  documents that contained intelligence data. The SRI still has  no clear picture of the nature of the respective documents or of  the reasons why they were hidden. A response is still expected  from the Prosecutor's Office.    Virgil Magureanu, Director of the Romanian Intelligence  Service Promised Not To Carry Out Any More Changes Without  Previously Discussing the Matter With the Parliamentary  Commission. The SRI Director Denied All Cases of Espionage  Referred to in the Press.    During the hearing, the SRI director mentioned that the  institution, whose chief he is, to this very day, does not have  accurate data that would confirm cases of espionage, as  published in the press. His statement was confirmed also by the  head of the Counterespionage Division of the SRI, who was  present at the hearing. Nevertheless, Virgil Magureanu said  that the SRI is investigating those cases that were brought up  by the press and will present a report to the Parliamentary  Commission.    The Commission asked the SRI director not to carry out any  more changes in the structure of that institution without  previously discussing it with members of parliament. In  conclusion, Virgil Magureanu promised that he will bring before  the commission all those dignitaries who are going to be  replaced, as well as those by whom they are going to be replaced.     "

Technical Guidance    As was stated in Chapter 1, the research laboratories  affiliated with AIST share basic research with each other. One  of the responsibilities of AIST is to widely disseminate the  technology and know-how that has been accumulating over many  years.    In the meantime, AIST research laboratories have been  receiving strong demands for technical assistance and  consultation regarding fundamental and basic research.    Therefore, in 1957, AIST decided to open a technical  assistance center in its main headquarters. Later, it opened  technical assistance centers at affiliated research  organizations. Those parties desiring technical assistance  should contact a technical assistance center (or technical  exchange and promotion center) at any of the AIST research  laboratories.    In accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations Governing  Inventions Made with AIST Technical Assistance, which was  approved by the Diet on February 25, 1972, each research  laboratory must exchange written confirmations with the  organizations with whom it is rendering assistance concerning  how inventions pertaining to said technical assistance will be  administered given the possibility of an invention.    AIST has established what are called liaison committees to  facilitate research exchanges, help with staff training, and  build cooperation with public examination and technology  centers. These were first formed in 1954 in order to raise the  technological level of local industries, particularly growth  industries, and to place more emphasis on RD in local public  research institutions.       1992 Technical Assistance and Consultation   Year                    FY88                        FY89   Research Laboratory     Assist        Advise        Assist        Advise   National Research       21            1089          24            374  Laboratory of  Metrology   Mechanical              75            564           80            480  Engineering  Laboratory   National Chemical       114           1149          92            1024  Laboratory for  Industry   Government Industrial   126           2890          103           2168  Research Institute,  Osaka   Government Industrial   147           1671          134           1240  Research Institute,  Nagoya   Fermentation Research   62            1352          73            1391  Institute   Research Institute      56            329           43            356  for Polymers and  Textiles   Geological Survey of    8             1101          54            1418  Japan   Electrotechnical        118           751           172           700  Laboratory   Industrial Products     45            255           40            208  Research Institute   Research Institute      46            745           38            732  for Environment and  Natural Resources   Government Industrial   35            324           39            336  Development  Laboratory, Hokkaido   Government Industrial   26            935           29            805  Research Institute,  Kyushu   Government Industrial   16            460           16            405  Research Institute,  Shikoku   Government Industrial   22            113           17            100  Research Institute,  Tohoku   Government Industrial   17            178           9             112  Research Institute,  Chugoku   Total                   934           13,906        963           11,849       "

English growers, facing tough foreign competition, need to be sure that storing fruit does not harm its quality, Andrew Fisher writes. To improve storage of fresh produce, Eastern Electricity, the UK power company, is pioneering a technique which uses nitrogen to help establish the right atmosphere. It will work with Domnick Hunter, the water and gas filter specialist, to produce generators for this market. The portable nitrogen generator was designed by Eastern Electricity and developed at the Industrial Energy Efficiency Centre, partly funded by the company. In the controlled atmosphere of a refrigerated warehouse, fruit continues to ripen if the building is less than air tight; if it has to be opened, the sudden rise in oxygen content accelerates deterioration. The nitrogen prevents this. Eastern Electricity: UK, 0473 553416   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2813 Industrial Gases.     P3569 General Industrial Machinery, NEC.

Caused by a mixture of bad luck, bad blood and bad planning,  the breakdown of the dam's lock system has featured the  suspected murder of a ship captain, insinuations of espionage  and millions of dollars in damages claimed by shipping companies.    It also has fulfilled some of the worst predictions about  the  communist-era dam and hydroelectric project, which began  operating in 1992.    ""The impact is tremendous,"" said Karl Brewi, general  director  of the Vienna-based Austrian Danube Shipping Company (DDSG),  which had 30 vessels delayed. Although Slovak dam officials say  80 vessels were stuck in queues--51 upstream and 29  downstream--shipping companies put the number in the hundreds as  crews waited in Hungarian or Austrian ports for the go-ahead.    The most recent trouble at the controversial Gabcikovo  hydroelectric plant--which has been the focus of a  Hungarian-Slovak transborder dispute for years--began Feb. 11  when a Ukrainian tugboat capsized in the dam's right lock. The  captain was found hanged inside the half-submerged vessel.    Slovak police are suspicious of the apparent suicide.    ""A ship has an accident and the captain thinks he must hang  himself in the next couple of minutes?"" said Miroslav Liska,  spokesman for the Bratislava-based Water Development Authority  (Vodohospodarska vystavba), which operates the dam. The captain,  Liska pointed out, was nearing retirement and had just bought a  car that he was bringing home to Ukraine.    ""A Ukrainian who just bought a car would not hang himself,""  he said. ""It shows that maybe he did not hang himself, but was  hanged.""    Slovak police may never learn the full story, because the  Ukrainian crew left the scene shortly after the accident, when  Ukraine insisted on removing the crippled vessel without Slovak  participation. This operation took close to a month, while  Ukrainian ships arrived and then removed the tug. ""We wanted to  remove it immediately,"" Liska said, ""but we were too benevolent.""    During this time, Gabcikovo's left lock slowly ferried the  dam's regular 20 to 30 ships a day back and forth, although it  had been scheduled to shut down Feb. 12 for a routine  inspection, Liska said. On March 20, just over a month after the  first accident, the left lock broke down, bringing all traffic  to a halt.    Shipping companies were outraged to learn that Gabcikovo has  no emergency gate--a standard feature of any lock system. Aside  from criticism about the dam's effect on local farmland and  water tables, this omission supported long-standing claims that  the dam was poorly constructed.    Under the terms of the original Slovak-Hungarian agreement  for constructing the cross-border waterworks, signed in 1979,  Hungary was to build an emergency gate on its side. After  Hungary unilaterally backed out of the agreement in 1992, a move  Slovaks continue to call illegal, no emergency gate was built.  One is under construction now on the Slovak side and should be  completed by late 1995, according to Liska.    Though Slovak dam officials have no explanation for the  breakdown of the left lock, diving teams claim to have found a  cable that may have interfered with the lock's seal. Espionage  is suspected. The final word is pending, however, while the left  lock is fully drained and an investigation is completed.    River traffic started moving again April 27 after the right  lock went back into operation and a Romanian ship passed through  a test run at 11 a.m. The last of the ships stuck in the  month-long queue was expected to pass through by the next day.    With delayed deliveries of steel, iron ore, agricultural  products and liquid fuel, DDSG puts its damages at more than $3  million.    ""It is not correct to operate a lock system like Gabcikovo  without these doors,"" DDSG's Brewi said. Brewi plans to seek  damages from Gabcikovo and expects his Hungarian and Ukrainian  counterparts to do the same. ""They have suffered even higher  losses than we have,"" he said.    One possibility may be to appeal through the technical  section of the Danube Commission, which oversees operation along  the river but has little authority to extract fines. Another  possibility is taking the matter to the International Court of  Justice in The Hague.    In either case, the shipping companies are ready for a  fight.    Gabcikovo has already rejected a $6 million claim from  Ukrainian shipping companies, Liska said. ""I don't think anyone  can claim damages [from road authorities] when a big crash  happens on the highway and the traffic is delayed.""     "

Not many details are available so far for obvious reasons.  Thus, the name of the exposed spy is not given, the same as the  duration of his work for MI-6. But even the smallest pieces of  information available show that a serious damage could be caused  to Russia, because the data conveyed by the SIS agent concerned  the latest developments in building various arms systems, their  tactical technical parameters, funding of defence-related  activities, the present condition and prospects for military  technical cooperation between Russia and foreign countries.    Last year, 20 foreign special agents were brought to trial  in  Russia. The arrest of another spy spotlit an extremely thorny  problem, that of reliable protection of our secrets. This  problem is not new, but it calls for serious consideration and  solution, taking into account the increasing shift towards  industrial espionage in activities of special services,  according to Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service. This  holds true not only about the U.S., British and German secret  services, but also to major Western corporations seeking to  obtain, by any possible means, information about plans of their  rivals, of which Russia [is] a key one. For this reason,  experts note, our country needs a mechanism for reliable  protection of its priorities in the fields of science,  technology and know-how, let alone other specific activities.  Otherwise, it would be more profitable for Russian specialists  to sell their developments to the West, and shortly afterwards  the state would have to use them on a license basis.    The arrest of a British secret agent, who was caught  red-handed on January 15, is not the only case in a series of  spy exposures in russia. Many of them were much spoken about,  the others did not receive such a wide public response. All  this testifies to a continuous confrontation between the Soviet  and the Russian special services and foreign ones, which has  quite a long history. Some events in this history are as  follows.    In the United States: 1978 -- three diplomats were expelled  from the country, 1986 -- the number of expulsions made up 80  diplomats. 1987 -- Marine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree was  sentenced to 30 years in prison for espionage for the soviet  intelligence service. 1989 -- Soviet military diplomat Yuriy  Pakhtusov was declared persona non grata. Last February 1994 --  Russian Embassy counsellor Aleksandr Lysenko was expelled from  the United States.    As for the Soviet Union and Russia, the facts are as  follows:  March 7, 1983 -- U.S. Embassy First Secretary Richard Osborne  was expelled from the country. September 11, 1983 -- U.S.  Consul in Leningrad London Davin Augustenborg were declared  personas non grata. [as received] June 2, 1983 -- U.S. Embassy  attache Lewis Thomas was caught red-handed in Moscow. June 13,  1985 -- U.S. Embassy Second Secretary Paul Stonebough was  declared persona non grata. 1986 -- Over 10 U.S. diplomats were  declared personas non grata. September 7, 1986 -- Charges were  brought against U.S. Citizen Nicholas Daniloff who was detained  on August 30, 1986, during a secret spy action. He was expelled  from the country on September 29. March 1989 -- Aide to the  military attache Daniel F. van Ghandi was declared persona non  grata. February 1994 -- U.S. Embassy counsellor James Morris  was declared persona non grata.    In Great Britain: 1972-1984 -- nine Soviet diplomats were  expelled from the country. 1985 -- former KGB secret police  officer Oleg Gordiyevsky, who was recruited by britain's MI-6 in  1974, was illegally taken from the Soviet Union. September 1985  -- 25 Soviet representatives were expelled from Great Britain.  The Soviet side retaliated by expelling six British  representatives from the country on September 18, 1985. 1989 --  the British Government expelled from the country 11 Soviet  officials and declared another three Soviet officials, who left  the country earlier, personas non grata.    May 1989 -- the Soviet Government expelled 11 British  officials from the country. Three British citizens, who earlier  worked in Moscow, were declared personas non grata.    In France: 1977 -- a Soviet official at UNESCO was expelled.  1980 -- the Soviet consul in Marseilles was expelled. Late  March 1983 -- French authorities expelled from the country,  without any grounds, 47 staffers of the Soviet embassy and other  offices. March 16, 1987 -- seven men were arrested in Rouen on  charges of industrial espionage for the Soviet Union. Failing  to prove their guilt, court had to release the suspects.    This is how the special services of Russia, the United  States, Great Britain and France had been working for the past  several years. And this work is most likely to be continued in  future.     "
0,FT931-4431 ,"FT931-4431 _AN-DCKCYABTFT 930311   FT  11 MAR 93 / Absenteeism higher for British-owned companies      By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff   ABSENTEEISM may have taken over from strikes as the British disease, according to evidence published today by the Industrial Society. It says workers in Japanese-owned companies in the UK take far fewer days off sick than those working for home-owned companies. Sickness absence is two-thirds higher for UK organisations than their Japanese counterparts. The absence rate - the percentage of working days lost a year - is 3.9 per cent for UK companies and 2.35 per cent for Japanese-owned groups. The findings come from a survey of 600 organisations by the Industrial Society following employer concern about levels of absence among workers. Government figures show that more than 200m working days and more than Pounds 9bn in production is lost each year. But the survey also shows that the absence rate for UK companies is down substantially from 5.05 per cent in 1987. The recession was seen by managers to have had a mixed effect - some employees improved their attendance because they feared for their jobs, but others suffered increased stress. The survey found Japanese companies could have greater success in controlling sick leave because of better employee communications about the number of absences and smaller working groups. Japanese companies were more likely to ask candidates about their attendance record at interviews, and find out why employees were away after every absence, however short. Overall, managers did not always believe the reasons for absence offered by workers. More than half of managers felt emotional and personal problems and stress caused more absence than their employees were prepared to admit on certification forms. Wish You Were Here.

The plan is to change from the conventional multifaceted  research and development program to specialization by field  founded on regional characteristics. AIST initiated a  large-scale restructuring in January of this year by  reorganizing its Tsukuba laboratories. This undertaking will  spread to other regions. The objectives are to eliminate  duplicate research as much as possible throughout AIST, to  rationalize research activities while advancing the priority  allocation of research appropriations, and to further strengthen  basic, creative research.    According to AIST, the plan is to establish future research  pillars for specialized fields by having Hokkaido GIRI use the  research resources at its Microgravity Laboratory and perform  research on cold region biotechnology; Tohoku GIRI, research  metals; Nagoya GIRI, fine ceramics; Osaka GIRI, functional  materials; Chugoku GIRI, ocean environment research; Shikoku  GIRI, marine resources; and Kyushu GIRI, natural resources.    Each region has unique characteristics and an established  research base. For example, in Kamisunagawa, Hokkaido, the  invention of materials for use in a microgravity environment is  being tackled based at the only microgravity research facility  in Japan. Also, in the Chugoku region, the closed marine region  of Japan's Inland Sea is used for research on marine  environments. In Kyushu, natural resources like coal and clay  are used to advance research on environmentally friendly  materials.    AIST will revise its administrative rules and change the  name  ``Government Industrial Research Institute'' to ``Government  Industrial Research Laboratory,'' effective October 1 of this  year. It was decided that the change to an appropriate name was  important given the true state of research. With the shift  towards basic, creative research, in addition to advancing  multifaceted research, for instance, in biotechnology, new  materials, and mechatronics, specialization in specific fields  was planned for each research laboratory.    This restructuring will not take place over a short period  of  time, but will proceed over the next five to 10 years at AIST.  The policy is to further the appointment, placement, and  transfer of researchers, and the provision of facilities.     "

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The Foreign Operations Appropriations Act of 1994 contains a provision (section 575) designating $35,000,000 for a ``Ukraine/Russia Stabilization Partnerships Program.'' The Secretary of Energy has been charged with the implementation of the program, which allowed for the inclusion of the other New Independent States (NIS), and is now referred to as the ``NIS Industrial Partnering Program.''         The program will have two principal components. Both are intended to assist NIS institutes with converting from defense to commercial applications thereby reducing the potential for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The first component is designed to engage the scientists and engineers at key technical and scientific institutes of the NIS in non-defense activities. This component is an expansion of unclassified cooperative non-defense research and development activities that have been conducted for some time between individual DOE National Laboratories and individual NIS institutes.     The second component is designed to assist in stabilizing the NIS technical and scientific infrastructure, to encourage the commercialization of NIS technologies, and promote the development in the NIS of market-oriented economies. A number of cost-shared international industrial partnerships will be formed, each involving at least one DOE National Laboratory, one NIS institute, and at least one U.S. industrial entity, whose contribution to the success of the partnership will be critical. A significant portion of the U.S. Government contribution to support the program is intended for NIS institutes to spur follow-on trade and investment by U.S. industry.     In July 1993, DOE sponsored a meeting, involving representatives from the National Laboratories and representatives of U.S. private sector entities with experience in NIS-to-U.S. technology transfer and commercialization. As a result of that, and subsequent meetings, it was concluded that a program of commercial industry-selected partnerships to invest in NIS technologies would be facilitated if a consortium of U.S. private sector entities could be established. The Secretary of Energy would then enter into a cooperative agreement with such a consortium, using the authority, and under the terms set out in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, the Cooperative Research Act of 1984, and other applicable statutes. The consortium would be required to give special attention to the needs of small businesses under the program.     Accordingly, U.S. industry representatives have voluntarily formed and incorporated the U.S. Industry Coalition (USIC) with an interim Board of Directors.   Membership in USIC will be required for participation in cost-sharing projects that involve the section 575 funds. Membership in USIC will be open to all U.S. entities, including universities, consortia, and corporations incorporated in the United States.

The State Council Information Office held a news conference  for Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing today. During the  news conference, Ye Qing, vice minister of the State Planning  Commission, briefed the reporters on these two documents and  answered their questions.    Ye Qing said: The ""Outlines of the State's Industrial Policy  for the Nineties"" and the ""Policy for the Automobile Industry,""  which serves as one of the special industrial policies in the  outlines, are important measures to adapt to the new situation  of China's socialist market economy; strengthen and improve  macroeconomic control; readjust and maximize industrial  structure; and promote a sustained, rapid, and sound development  of national economy.    Ye Qing said: In light of the objective rules of  industrialization and modernization as well as national  realities and structural changes in China, the outlines forward  major subjects needed to be solved when China readjusts and  maximizes its industrial structure in the nineties. The  subjects are: First, it is necessary to continue to strengthen  the farming sector's status as the foundation of the national  economy and comprehensively develop the rural economy. Second,  great efforts should be made to build basic industries and  improve a situation in which basic industries and  infrastructural facilities are backward. Third, it is necessary  to accelerate the growth of pillar industries so as to  invigorate the national economy. Fourth, it is imperative to  reasonably readjust foreign trade system and strengthen the  ability of China's industrial sectors in international  competition. Meanwhile, massive efforts should be made to  develop the tertiary industry and accelerate the development of  high and new technological industry. It is necessary to maximize  the industrial structure and promote industrial and technical  standards so as to have an even better industrial distribution.    The ""Policy for the Automobile Industry,"" which was  promulgated at the same time as the outlines, clearly defines  China's goal for the development of the automobile industry;  policies for industrial organization, industrial technology, and  industrial distribution; as well as policies concerning foreign  funds and foreign trade. This special industrial policy has  been put into force.    In accordance with the outlines' requirements, the State  Council will also continue to examine and approve special  industrial policies for transportation, telecommunications,  construction, electronic, machine-building, and petrochemical  industries; and policies related to foreign funds, foreign  trade, technology, and readjustment of industrial organization.    Ye Qing said: The ""Outlines of the State's Industrial Policy  for the Nineties"" also clearly stipulate the procedures for  formulating industrial policies and their implementing measures.  The outlines stipulate the following rules: (1) The State  Council will decide the state's industrial policies. State  Planning Commission will be responsible for the overall work of  studying, formulating, and coordinating the state's industrial  policies. The State Planning Commission will initiate, with  help from departments concerned, the work of formulating various  industrial policies. (2) It is necessary to set up a reviewing  system for the state's industrial policies. (3) It is necessary  to set up a system that serves to guarantee the implementation  of the state's industrial policies. (4) It is necessary to set  up a system for the supervision, inspection, and appraisal of  the state's industrial policies. (5) People's governments at  provincial level should study and formulate, in accordance with  the requirements of the outlines and local realities, specific  rules for the implementation of these outlines and submit them  to the State Planning Commission for the record.    The outlines also put forewords ""Some Regulations Concerning  the Standards of Economic Scale for Fixed Asset Investment  Projects (First Group),"" which clearly stipulate the standards  of economic scale for a group of fixed asset investment projects.

The plan is aimed at actively  supporting efforts to standardize industrial products in Asia,  which has become the center of the world's growth; at launching  measures for Asia to create international standard  specifications, and at using revised JIS as a guide to maintain  the transparency of trade. To clarify its policy to give  importance to consumers, the ISTA will consider abolishing  standards which attach too much importance to manufacturers.  The agency is to formulate a draft plan for the review by the  end of April. After being discussed by the Japanese Industrial  Standards Committee (chaired by Isamu Yamashita), the plan will  be included in the eighth five-year products standardization  program, which is to come into effect in fiscal year 1996.    The main pillars of the revision will be: 1)  internationalization; 2) a shift of importance to consumers; and  3) the flexible adjustment of JIS to new processes such as  multimedia technology.    Japan has tried to internationalize its industrial standards  primarily through adjusting them to those of the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO). However, because ISO is  composed mainly of European countries, only 20 to 30 percent of  JIS have so far been adjusted to ISO standards. Meanwhile, it  is considered certain that many new products will be developed  in Asia, a region with a strong momentum of growth, and various  problems will crop up concerning new standards. The government  plans to actively participate in the work to establish  international standards by such means as promoting  standardization mainly in Asia and strengthening efforts to have  the ISO approve Asian standards as official ones.    This month, the government started discussions on the  establishment of a system to promote standardization with the  ASEAN Association for Standardizing Quality Control (ACCQ)  [acronym as published], which is composed of six Southeast Asian  nations. With reference to Japan's know-how, they will work out  their own five-year programs for the promotion of  standardization and will carry them out beginning April 1995.    Japan will also work to establish standards for such  products  as hearing aids and walking sticks, which are essential to  living in an aging society and for a rich life. There are  currently no standards for them. On the other hand, it will  abolish standards established to promote exchanges of parts  between manufacturers, and those for mature products such as  sewing machine parts whose shapes are not expected to diversify  any further.

In pioneering  research where preparatory research for projects and  pre-evaluation are performed, five new research problems will be  undertaken next year, beginning with precise polymeric  materials. Of the five pioneering research currently underway,  inorganic materials with high-order structure control will be  elevated to a project next year. The budget for next year  received as 6.2 increase over the budget for fiscal year  1993  for the whole system to 25.9 billion. A 63.4  increase of  about 400 million is planned for pioneering research.    The Industrial Science and Technology Research and  Development Program established this year is integrated into the  older Large Scale RD Program. The pioneering research  program  is set up with the objective of determining which program should  become a project. Pioneering research will last two to three  years with an annual budget of 4 or 5 billion for one theme.    Pioneering research programs which will begin next year are  (1) Precise Polymeric Materials, (2) Accelerated Bio Functions  Fabrication Technology (time machine bio), (3) Human Media and  Expert Machine Technology (tentative name), (4) Next Generation  Metal Resource Production Technology, and (5) Manufactured Goods  Evaluation and High-Level Measurement Analysis Technology.    In the Precise Polymeric Materials research, polymer methods  which precisely control the one-dimensional structure of  polymers and techniques to accurately analyze the structure of  polymer sequence will be investigated and developed. The  essential performance and function of current polymers cannot be  understood by perturbing the chemical structure. The intent of  this research is to solve these shortcomings. A basic technology  of polymer materials for the next generation is expected.    Accelerated Bio Function Fabrication Technology has the  objectives of clarifying the mechanisms of the evolution of  living things and building evolutionary test system with  artificial mutations at the laboratory level. Based on this, it  will be possible to create biological functions for the  objectives of ultra heat resistance and ultra pressure  resistance that are applicable to chemical material  manufacturing processes.    In Next Generation Metal Resource Manufacturing Technology,  metal recycling technology which places a light load on the  environment and conserves energy by using light and bacteria  will be developed. A precision manufacturing system which  collects uniform resources and does not use smokestacks will be  developed. The aim is to effectively use resources and to  contribute solutions to the world's environmental problems.     "

After six months of research, Taiwan's ""Council for Economic  Planning and Development,"" maintaining that the high output  yielded by scientific and technological industries can create  more jobs, increase incomes, and create more business  opportunities, has come up with these plans: 1) Expanding the  Xinzu [Hsinchu] Scientific and Industrial Park in northern  Taiwan to cover parts of Xinzu and Miaoli Counties; and building  a new, 300-hectare scientific and industrial park in Guiren  [Kuijen] township in Tainan, southern Taiwan, and making it a  high-tech zone for the development of biotechnology, precision  instruments, and aviation and space industries. 2. Establishing  one software industrial zone each in Taibei [Taipei], Taizhong  [Taichung], and Gaoxiong [Kaohsiung]. 3. Establishing one  scientific and technological industrial zone each in northern  Xinzu in northern Taiwan, in Yunlin County in central Taiwan,  and in Annan district in southern Taiwan.    On this basis, Taiwan's ""Economic Affairs Ministry  Industrial  Bureau"" has come up with the ""Medium- and Long-Range Plan for  the Development of Industrial Zones in the Taiwan Region.""  Included in the plan is the establishment of additional  software industrial zones, a center in Gaoxiong for disposing of  industrial wastes in southern Taiwan, and a center in the  Zhanghua [Changhua] Industrial Zone for disposing of industrial  wastes in central Taiwan in order to reduce pollution caused by  industrial wastes. According to the ""Industrial Bureau,"" the  plan is meant for bringing about an even development in Taiwan,  and correcting the shortcomings of uneven economic development  caused by the establishment of the majority of  scientific-technological industrial zones in the north.    Of the 140 industrial zones with a total area of 30,761  hectares designated to be developed, the development of 78 with  a total area of 13,108 hectares, has been completed; and nine  industrial zones with a total area of 5,687 hectares are being  developed. Since land acquisition has become increasing  difficult in Taiwan, relevant authorities in Taiwan are  encouraging land owners and private enterprises to take part in  the development of industrial zones so the construction process  can be expedited.    Moreover, in view of the fact that Taiwan's water resources  are deteriorating and water shortages have become increasingly  serious, the ""Council of Economic Planning and Development"" has  completed its ""Plan for the Development of Water Resources,""  deciding that, during the next 20 years, 381.4 billion Taiwan  dollars will be raised for the construction of 18 dams with an  estimated effective capacity of 187,000 tonnes [figure as  received], which is precisely the total capacity of the existing  40 dams in Taiwan. These dams will be developed by stages to  provide the water needed for daily and industrial consumption.  On the average, these dams will be able to increase water  supply by 3.28 billion tonnes of water annually.    Meanwhile, Taiwan is continuing with its six-year ""national  construction plan,"" focusing on 12 construction projects,  including the renovation and construction of secondary and  primary school facilities, the construction of parks and sports  facilities, the construction of local and community cultural  software and hardware facilities, the development of new urban  areas and ""national housing"" projects, the construction of new  roads and parking lots in residential areas, the construction of  business districts, the construction of north-south expressways,  a mass transit system in the Gaoxiong Metropolitan district  (traffic improvement project), the construction of subways in  Taizhong and Tainan cities, and the construction of garbage  incinerators and landfill yards.

The entire system characteristic of the political police has  been organized by the UM 0215 -- the secret service of the  Ministry of Interior [MI]. Under the leadership of the former  interior minister, George Ion Danescu, and his close aide,  General Dan Gheorghe, a few days ago still the chief of the UM  0215 Secret Service, a comprehensive and extremely precise work  method was drafted, which is compulsory for all regional  intelligence services. This method, which we possess,  constitutes an indubitable proof that top officials in the  Ministry of Interior have initiated the most flagrant violation  of the Constitution and the country's laws, thus seriously  jeopardizing our citizens' freedom. We want to specify that all  information obtained from this extensive network of agents is  entered on a daily basis in the computer of the Romanian  Intelligence Service [SRI]. Then this information is used for  political purposes. Thus, SRI is doing its dirty work with the  help of the secret service of the Ministry of Interior. The  astonishing thing is that a parliamentary commission (which  checked unit 0215 some two months ago) discovered a number of  irregularities, but failed to discover the essential thing. The  secret of this monster within the Ministry of Interior has been  carefully preserved so far.    The espionage affair in which Lieutenant General Marin  Pancea, counselor to President Ion iliescu and secretary of the  country's Defense Council, was allegedly involved and the  dismissals of Major General Gh. Diaconescu, chief of the SRI  Espionage Department, and of General Dan Gheorghe, chief of the  UM-0215 within the Ministry of Interior, as well as the  espionage affair made public by Traian Basescu, at the end of  which is General Grylakis [involved in Romanian fleet sale  scandal], seem to be linked by certain threads but also through  mysterious rivalries at the top executive level.    Until the situation as a whole is clarified, we will reveal  to the public the following details about the most serious  political espionage case after 1989. If an earthquake will be  triggered in the Ministry of Interior and the SRI, and in  Romanian society on the whole, ending with the main protagonists  on the accusation bench, then this means that Romania still has  a chance to improve.    Secret Work Method    Here are the things with which the Intelligence Department  of  the Ministry of Interior -- UM-0215 -- dealt beginning 26 March  1993 (when Circular No. 00608801 was officially and secretly  disseminated). We will now summarize some of the compulsory  objectives pursued by the agents at home and abroad:    ""1. Actions against national security; 2. Nationalist,  irredentist, separatist, and racial actions; 3. Actions  regarding the physical life and security of Romanian and foreign  citizens whose security falls within the competence of the  Ministry of Interior (so far nothing abnormal, the above  activities being legal); 4. Specific information about  antiterrorist actions (a strange activity because there is a  specialized antiterrorist unit attached to the SRI, while,  through the nature of things, the Watch and Protection Service  (SPP) performs such activities); 5. Foreign citizens' actions;  6. Romanian citizens actions (and in this connection we will  reproduce and specify certain aspects of the secret work method  clearly revealing what 0215 actually pursued: `F. 63 --  attitudes, positions, assessments; F. 38 -- went abroad for  specialization; F. 39 -- studied abroad; F. 40 -- went abroad  for specialized assistance.'"" Above I have outlined certain  typical activities of the political police. And now further  details). 7. Specific essentials regarding state and  professional interests; 8. Specific essentials of the activity  of information protection; 9. Essentials regarding antecedents;  10. Specific essentials regarding operative information about  Romanians abroad. (And again some information about the method  regarding these ""essentials"": ""F. 12 -- employed at foreign  missions or foreign branches in Romania; F. 81 -- temporarily  resident abroad; F. 101 -- possession of funds; F. 107 -- people  holding dual citizenship."")    We hope that our readers realize how extensive and dangerous  this network is, which has been set up under the guidance of the  generals from the secret unit of the Ministry of Interior.  Circular No. 00608801 is signed by deputy directors -- Colonel  Marica, Colonel Condoiu, and Colonel Stan.    We also want to specify that following dispositions issued  for all regional units in a secret radiogram in May 1993, the  information obtained by this network is no longer passed on to  regional chiefs, but is necessarily entered in the SRI computer.  We doubt that the opposition parties have access to the data  obtained in this way.

In  China, where the telecommunications network infrastructure is  underdeveloped, the demand for mobile communications is  expanding very rapidly as means of communication supplementing  the telephone networks. Given the situation, the companies are  eager to start producing the cellular phones in joint-venture  projects as early as this year. European and U.S. companies are  already operating in China's cellular phone market, with the  U.S. firm Motorola holding 60 percent of the market. As for  Japan, its biggest cellular phone manufacturer, the Matsushita  Communication Industrial Company, is getting ready to start up  its local production in the spring. With the four other  Japanese companies following, intense competition is likely to  flare up among Japanese and U.S. companies.    NEC plans to set up a joint-venture company in China during  the first half of this year and to begin production by the fall.  As a production base, Wuhan is considered to be most desirable.  The initial scale of production by the company is to be 10,000  sets a month.    Fujitsu wants to begin producing its cellular phones within  this year at Nanjing Fujitsu (in Nanjing), which is a joint  venture company set up in 1992 to produce optical communications  systems. It has not decided on the scale of its production, but  once demand expands, Fujitsu says it ""will think about setting  up a new joint venture company.""    Hitachi and Oki Electric Industrial are now holding talks  [with China] with the intention of producing locally their  cellular phones. While they have yet to negotiate on details,  they are likely to be able to set up new companies and start  producing within this year. Oki Electric Industrial probably  will set up its production base in Shanghai.    The number of China's cellular phones is said to have been  less than 1 million at the end of 1992. But China is a country  where less than 2 percent of people have ordinary phones.  Therefore, the demand for mobile communications systems like  cellular phones and pagers is growing rapidly. The total market  for the systems was half a million sets in 1993, and it is  expected to increase to nearly 1 million sets in 1994.    The number of subscribers to cellular phones in Japan is  about 2 million at present. An officer of a major  communications equipment manufacturer said, ""The potential  demand in Japan cannot come even close to that of China."" Thus,  that Japanese industry's venture into China is likely to  increase.    As far as pagers -- which are becoming as popular as the  cellular phones are -- are concerned, the Matsushita  Communication Industrial Co. is now engaged in local production  at its joint venture company set up in Beijing in June 1992. In  addition, NEC and the Casio Computer Co. are set to begin  production at their joint venture companies soon.     "

The goal is  for a prestigious third party to evaluate the results and  progress of joint research at that research laboratory where  researchers from Japan and overseas, and from industry, the  government, and academia have gathered and tackled problems. In  addition, the employment of Russian researchers as public  research employees will also be studied.    The evaluation committee will consist of people with  well-known achievements both as researchers and as research  managers. The members are currently being selected. Beginning  with Japanese scientists who have won the Nobel Prize, 14  candidates are being appointed. Two or three heads of research  institutes in the United States and Germany are expected to  participate.    The content and management system of ongoing research at the  same research laboratory will be discussed every one or two  years. The evaluations of the evaluation committee will be  received as outside opinions; however, the independence of the  laboratory will be respected concerning the progress of research.    AIST will reorganize its national laboratories at Tsukuba.  As  one link, the laboratory was set up in January to undertake  basic research that intersects fields like materials and  information.    To promote joint research with, for instance, foreign or  private corporations, in 1993, 14 foreign researchers have  already been employed as public researchers in 15 national  research laboratories throughout Japan.

This was emphasised by both Deputy Prime Ministel Brigadier  General [BG] (NS [National Service]) Lee Hsien Loong and Chinese  Vice Premier Li Lanqing at a press conference held after the  inaugural meeting of the Joint Steering Council (JSC) for the  Suzhou project yesterday.    Chaired jointly by BG Lee and Mr. Li, who is here on a  five-day visit, the JSC is the bilateral body which oversees the  development of the Singapore-style Suzhou Township. Its members  include ministers and senior officials from key ministries and  agencies of Singapore and China.    Among Singapore's representatives are Trade and Industry  Minister Yeo Cheow Tong; the acting minister for national  development, Mr. Lim Hng Kiang; and Rear Admiral (NS) Teo Chee  Hean, the minister of state for finance.    BG Lee said that Singapore's software transfer programme to  Suzhou should not be treated merely as a commercial investment  project.    While Singapore has helped pay for part of the software  transfer programme, ""finance is not an important part of this  project,"" he said.    If the project could, in some small way, help China prosper,  it would be in Singapore's long-term interest, he noted.    Furthermore, he said Singapore would derive enormous  benefits  by developing ""a long-term understanding with Chinese officials  at many levels who would rise over the years.""    A successful Suzhou, he added, would also ""provide another  outpost for Singapore in its efforts to go regional.""    Under the software transfer arrangement, Singapore will help  provide public administration and management skills needed for  industrial township development to Suzhou officials.    So far, nine officials from Suzhou have been attached to  various statutory boards in Singapore to learn about urban  management as well as economic development and financial  management.    If successful, BG Lee noted, the Suzhou experience could  then  be replicated in other township developments in China.    On its parts, said Mr. Li, China would adopt a very flexible  approach towards the Suzhou project in order to help ensure its  early success.    As an example, he pointed out that the Jiangsu Provincial  Government had decided to make an exception by transferring the  administrative authority of five towns which were affected by  the township project, but which were not part of Suzhou City, to  the Suzhou Municipal Government itself.    That would allow the Suzhou Industrial Township Authority, a  Jurong Town Corporation-style statutory board that will be set  up soon, to have better control over the entire township  development.    BG Lee said Singapore will continue to share its experience  on industrial township development with Suzhou as long as the  latter finds it relevant and useful. But the initiative for the  ""software transfer"" will have to come from the Chinese side, he  noted.    ""You have to decide what is relevant to China's needs which  priority areas to focus on, and how to adapt Singapore's  experience for use in Suzhou. Singapore will proceed as quickly  and as extensively as the Chinese officials want to,"" he added.     "

Lizana and Corpesca [Fishing Corporation] leaders met Diaz  Albonico to express their total annoyance at the measure, which  Lizana characterized as discriminatory, because the Mexicans  have made a basic mistake in definition by believing that anyone  can dump a raw material such as fishmeal.    Asked about Mexico's intentions, Lizana said:    [Begin Lizana recording] Well, we cannot judge a country's  possible intentions when adopting certain measures. But it is  clear, since we are talking about a product freely traded in the  world market, that when you leave one supplier out you let  another supplier in.

He said that on 18 February he met Mexican Foreign Under  Secretary (Rosario Grin) to discuss the discriminatory character  of the measures adopted by Secofi [Commerce and Industrial  Development Secretariat].    [Begin Diaz Albonico recording] The measures are  discriminatory for two reasons. First, because they only punish  Chilean products; and second, because the tariffs or quotas  established for the products are much steeper than the tariffs  that existed before the signing of the economic cooperation  agreement. [end recording]    Diaz Albonico said the previous tariff on fishmeal was 15  percent while today it is nearly 24.8 percent, adding that this  is discriminatory.    According to Diaz Albonico, the Mexican under secretary  showed concern about the problem and talked with Secofi  officials about it. Chilean authorities expect Secofi officials  will be able to visit Chile and investigate the matter at the  beginning of March in order to solve the problem before Eduardo  Frei's inauguration. Diaz Albonico said the Mexican under  secretary believes there is political willingness to drop the  sanction, which is absolutely provisional, and that Chile has  made Mexican administrative authorities aware that the country  does not implement any dumping practices.

Figures released yesterday by Istat, the national statistics institute, showed production fell 7.7 per cent during the first two months of 1993 against the same period last year when there were two extra working days. The worst affected sectors continued to be engineering and transport, followed by textiles and clothing. The only area where production did not decline was foodstuffs.

0,FT943-10555 ,"FT943-10555 _AN-EHDDVAC7FT 940804   FT  04 AUG 94 / UNloved, UNwanted: A fitting fate for the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   You may have missed it, but 1980 to 1990 was the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. It had no impact whatsoever on the continent the first time round, but the perpetrator of this exercise in wishful thinking, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido), appears to work on the principle that Pooh Bear applied to his Hums. Pooh, it will be recalled, managed the first line of Hum without difficulty: 'Sing Ho] for the life of a bear.' It sounded splendid, but what came next? Pooh got stuck, until he had a brain wave. He would sing it very fast, in the hope the second line would just pop out. So will you please welcome the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa. There is not quite the same ring to it, for Unido seems to have been caught napping. The second decade runs from 1993 to 2002. Enough is enough. It is time to abolish a body whose demise would distress only its 1,200 employees and the hundreds of experts and consultants who feed from its Dollars 100m-a-year trough. Unido was introduced to the world on January 1 1967 through General Assembly resolution 2152 (XXI) of November 17 1966. From the start it had ideas above its station, claiming that it had a 'mandate to act as the central co-ordinating body for industrial activities within the UN system'. Like many organisations spawned by the United Nations, Unido has been sustained by pompous jargon and an overriding belief in its own importance. The concept of an Industrial Decade, whatever that means, is given spurious authenticity through the language signalling its creation. The general assembly, we are told, in Resolution 35/668 of December 5 1980, proclaimed the 1980s as the Industrial Development Decade for Africa 'thus giving worldwide recognition to the decade'. Of course, it did nothing of the sort, except for UN bureaucrats. A welter of documents sustained their fantasies, products of seminars and special sessions where the delegates draw their per diems and build nothing more substantial than castles in the air. By 1983 Unido had produced a slim volume of pensees entitled A Programme for the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. The reader is warned that this handbook 'differs in many respects from previous practice, and calls for a firm rejection of isolated piecemeal planning of the past and a clear shift away from over-occupation (sic) with foreign exchange problems external to the region'. So much for Africa's overvalued exchange rates of the era, the single most serious feature of the already evident economic crisis that was destroying the continent. 'The new approach,' the guidelines reveal, 'is also predicated on a decisive move towards the integrated development of the human resources, institutional mechanisms and technological capacities required to assess and utilise the natural resources and raw material endowments of the region, expand local markets, enlarge the range of complementarities and strengthen links between industry and other sectors of the economy.' Of course, these banal exhortations did Africa no service. What they did do was to alert consultants and experts worldwide that here was another UN gravy train. Like the 1970s, the 1980s saw a series of Unido country reports, stupefyingly bland in their analysis, out of date in their statistics, and deferential to autocratic governments and kleptocratic regimes. Like all UN organisations, Unido selects its officers more for their country of origin than their expertise. Thus places were found for assorted econometricians, agronomists and economists, most with dubious credentials. They usually owed their jobs to political patronage, and lived in a world of diplomatic privileges, duty free facilities and hardship allowances. Unlike the World Bank, no one subjects Unido to scrutiny. If anyone cared to assess its policies and proposals over the 1970s and the 1980s, the organisation would emerge deeply discredited. Today Unido has the chutzpah to claim that it 'assists both governments and the public and private sector through technical and investment promotion services, and with policy advice'. The suggestion that this ineffectual agency might assist the private sector, or have any insight into investment, is risible. To be fair, Unido should not be blamed for Africa's crisis. True, it bears the responsibility that attaches to those who stay silent when they should be sounding the alarm. But no one took much notice of Unido and its experts. And that is why no one will miss it.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.  The Financial Times   London Page 15  "

0,FT942-327 ,"FT942-327 _AN-EF2DYAGNFT 940629   FT  29 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Industrial users demand EU sugar reform      By ALISON MAITLAND   Industrial users of sugar yesterday demanded fundamental reform of the European Union's sugar regime, describing it as 'anachronistic'. European consumers paid two to three times more for sugar than the world price, costing them up to Ecu5.5bn extra a year, said the Committee of Industrial Users of Sugar. The committee, which represents companies purchasing and processing 70 per cent of the sugar consumed in Europe, said the current regime, unchanged since 1968, 'rewards producers on the basis of the least efficient, not the most efficient'. The European Commission is due to present proposals for reforming the sugar sector by the autumn. Sugar, along with wine and fruit and vegetables, was exempted from the far-reaching shake-up of the common agricultural policy in 1992. The pressure for reform has been increased by last December's Gatt agreement, which requires cuts in subsidised EU exports of sugar of more than 10 per cent. The committee said European supply far exceeded demand, which meant taxpayers had to foot the bill for export refunds on sales of surpluses to the world market. 'In addition, there is the fact that rigid national production quotas, which are inconsistent with the concept of a single market, block production moving to the best suited areas in Europe,' it said. The committee called for gradual cuts in sugar prices and for liberalisation of the quota system, to enable quotas to be transferred across national boundaries. 'We are calling for progressive, gradual reform, not overnight change, so that all parties concerned can work together to achieve a more efficient sugar regime,' said Mr Tom Harrison, committee president.

0,FT944-2963 ,"FT944-2963 _AN-ELOCSAE3FT 941215   FT  15 DEC 94 / Industrial tribunal reform aimed at reducing delays      By RICHARD WOLFFE   Industrial tribunals will have the power to weed out weak cases under reform proposals put forward by the government yesterday aimed at reducing tribunal delays and raising standards. The change is part of a package of proposals in a green paper which, however, draws back from radical reform of the industrial tribunal system despite calls from both employers and unions for a wholesale review. Both have complained of delays and excessive legal interference. The green paper concentrates on efficiency measures such as imposing time limits on proceedings and deciding on written evidence where both parties agree. Controversial proposals to charge applicants fees to enter claims as a means of discouraging weak claims have been rejected by the government. The green paper says there should be special pre-hearings and cases could also be dismissed during the course of proceedings. It recommends all cases, other than those on unfair dismissal and discrimination, should be heard by tribunal chairmen alone. Tribunals at present have two lay members, in addition to the legally trained chairman, representing the interests of employers and employees. Industrial tribunals' caseloads rose by 150 per cent in the five years to 1993-94 to reach 73,000 cases. The administrative budget has increased by 75 per cent since 1988 to Pounds 26.6m this year. The CBI said the document was timely and that there was room for improvement in the existing service to all users. The Engineering Employers Federation welcomed further proposals to promote voluntary binding settlements as an alternative to a full tribunal hearing. The Labour Party condemned the proposals as 'a sacker's charter' and Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, described the green paper as a 'missed opportunity' to increase security at work and strengthen legal guarantees of justice.

The third  installment of these reports -- ""Hongyun Company Builds the  Bridge"" -- gave an account of the role it has played as a  starter in the reform of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation. It was also this company that had offered the  first expenses for the training of the corporation's surplus  personnel, which has created a favorable ""microclimate"" for  in-depth reform. This article will mainly brief readers on how  the Beijing Match Plant, a breakthrough point of reform in the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, trained and diverted  more than two-thirds of its staff and workers to work elsewhere.    Where lies the difficulty in revitalizing large and  medium-sized state enterprises? The greatest difficulty lies in  the inability to divert numerous surplus personnel to work in  other units because enterprises find it very difficult to absorb  these personnel by themselves and society also finds it  difficult to bear the burden, as the social insurance system is  still unsound. That is why people called this a ""tight knot.""    The Beijing Match Plant, with a staff of 868 people, was a  subsidiary of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation.  It had only 60 people left when it reorganized and moved out of  the urban district to continue its match production. The  surplus personnel all were diverted to other units, but none of  them lodged a complaint against the plant, appealed to the  higher authorities for help, or created trouble. This great  event -- and in Beijing Municipality, at that -- was handled  very smoothly and without causing any disturbance.    How did they untie this ""tight knot""?    Neither society nor enterprises were in a position to  bear the burden of surplus personnel. Hence, the Beijing First  Light Industrial Corporation created an independent intermediary  organization to manage its work force -- an organization that  takes on the responsibility for untying the ""tight knot"" from  beginning to end.    As a matter of fact, the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation succeeded in discovering a starter -- the Hongyun  Company -- for the development of state assets and comprehensive  reform. Meanwhile, the issue of relocation and placement of  labor resources also was resolved, and funds for establishing a  compensatory unemployment insurance mechanism have been  relatively sufficient. However, who will undertake the heavy  responsibility of ""diverting the staff and workers to work  elsewhere""?    In fact, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has  studied the solution of the increasingly serious problem of  redundant personnel over the past few years. There were nearly  80,000 staff and workers in the corporation. Even if the factor  of industrial structure was not considered, the rate of surplus  personnel still exceeded 30 percent. A few years ago, in order  to invigorate the employment system, they optimized labor  organization, which resulted in a reduction of 8,000 people from  among the 80,000 staff and workers. For this reason, the  corporation was at the forefront of the entire municipality in  this respect. However, owing to the unsound insurance system,  excessively scanty amount of unemployment compensation, and the  inability of the untrained personnel to enter the market, most  of the staff and workers returned to their original posts one  after another, and a number of new contradictions were elicited  accordingly.    ""The diversion of staff and workers in state-owned  enterprises should be resolved by way of a market mechanism, but  should not wait until the perfect establishment of a labor  market. Therefore, it calls for setting up an economic entity  that will act as an intermediary for the development and  placement of labor force in keeping with the market law."" This  is a consensus reached by the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation through assiduous exploration of the issue of  diverting staff and workers to other jobs. Consequently, when  the Hongyun Investment Company -- an asset development company  -- was founded, expenses needed for the diversion of staff and  workers were allotted from this company to set up an economic  entity with independent assets: the Beijing Jingqing Labor  Service Development Company. Its duties are as follows: 1) The  management of staff and workers during the removal period to  redevelop the assets of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation; 2) The training of staff and workers to enhance  their quality; and 3) The transition from a centralized job  placement system to a new employment mechanism suited to the  market economic structure through the integration of labor force  employment system with labor insurance system, so as to achieve  the objective of appropriately assigning jobs for staff and  workers in society.    This labor force management intermediary  organization took overall responsibility for unemployment  insurance, training for job transference, and job assignment of  the asset development enterprises [zi chan kai fa qi ye 6327  3934 7030 4099 0120 2814], so that state-owned enterprises were  able to perform the tasks of asset development ""with light  burdens."" In this regard, we may say that it was the Beijing  Jingqing Labor Service Development Company that untied the  ""tight knot.""    The big pot has been broken, and everyone is longing for a  new and fine bowl after being trained. People hope that those  in work can have more pay for more work, that those who are our  of work need not worry about their food and clothing, and that  those who seek new jobs will also obtain benefits. They have  something to wish for and have actually gained something.  Thanks to these ""two wheels,"" the diversion of staff and  workers has progressed at a more rapid pace.    At the end of 1993 when the match plant, with a history of  70  years, was leveled to the ground amid the rumble of bulldozers,  the staff and workers really could not calm their feelings. ""I  can do nothing but dip the heads of matches and package them, so  I am incapable of finding a new job. What am I to live on in  the future?""    Just a couple of months later, the once-agitated and  disappointed hearts were overflowing with beautiful aspirations.  Among the 868 staff and workers, some of the elderly ones  retired ahead of time, others were transferred to work in a new  factory, and it was arranged for the remaining 558 personnel to  receive training for other posts. On the basis of full  investigation and study, the Beijing Jingqing Labor Service  Development Company has made training plans in line with the  requirements of society and of management and service work for  the small residential district built on the site of the original  match plant. Here, the company started 14 training courses,  including business accounting, computer science, enterprise  business administration, commercial services, cooking,  cosmetology, hair-dressing, gardening, driving, automobile  maintenance, tailoring, and so on. After these people were  released from work to receive training for three to 12 months,  those who passed examinations were issued certificates  certifying their qualifications for reemployment, their grades,  and their standard equivalent to technical secondary school  graduates. In this way, they were qualified to participate in  the talent competition on the market, thereby achieving the  ultimate goal of two-way selection between enterprises and  individuals through training so that the superior ones were able  to find new jobs. For this reason, staff and workers were  extremely enthusiastic about attending training courses. Some  said: ""Reform did not kick us out and leave us alone. The  state has spent money on our training, paid our basic salaries,  and prepared us for re-employment. That is why we are most  willing to learn, despite fatigue and hardships, because it is  to our own benefit to learn the skills, is it not?"" Some types  of work -- like driving and hair-dressing -- require higher and  special skills, so the trainees must pay for part of the  expenses. They paid readily, without saying a word.    Without doubt, the opportunity to find an occupation again,  the pressure of obtaining a job based on one's own  qualifications and not by assignment, and the pursuit of a new  profession are powerful driving forces for staff and workers to  keep their minds diligently on their studies. In addition, the  Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company also gave  consideration to appropriate interest stimulation for the  job-awaiting staff and workers, who live on their salaries,  through the following measures: 1) The salaries of staff and  workers who persist in production are higher than their original  levels; 2) Salaries during training are lower than those  received when they were at work; 3) The compensation given to  personnel waiting for employment is larger than social  compensation; 4) Sick and resigned personnel are given a  lump-sum subsidy in an amount generally equivalent to one-third  of their annual income; 5) Those who suspend work and pay while  retaining their posts are granted a lump-sum subsidy, but should  pay unified funds for old age and management fees for keeping  files; and 6) Those who resign and will find jobs on their own  are given subsidies equivalent to their salary income of two and  a half years. Within two weeks of the announcement of these  measures, four people asked for transfers, three resigned, and  most of the students in the driver training course said they  would try their best to find jobs by themselves after the  training.    Overstaffing is not only a tough problem for asset  development enterprises, but also one that state-owned  enterprises wish very much to resolve. In-depth exploration is  being carried out at a new level.    Although students in various training courses had not  obtained their graduation certificates, recruitment units in  society began to call on them, one after another. The  restaurant service training class would finish its course by the  end of April, but a unit told the students that it would come to  recruit more than half of them at the end of March. The  gardening class was in similar circumstances, as a unit readily  announced the recruitment of half the students....    However, personalities responsible for the Beijing Jingqing  Labor Service Development Company did not dare to relax their  efforts in the least. The aim of this company is to take care  of the work to divert nearly 20,000 staff and workers in 32  enterprises engaged in asset development or relocating to other  places. Liang Jingao, general manager of the company, proposed  an even higher goal: The Beijing Jingqing Labor Service  Development Company ultimately should undertake the entire task  of diverting all surplus personnel in the state-owned  enterprises under the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation, so that all these enterprises can shake off their  burdens and ""march with light packs.""    In light of the large numbers of surplus personnel  prominently existing on the Chinese sides [xiao mu ti 1420 3018  7555] of joint ventures at present, they have decided to start  with this, by using for reference the practice of diverting  personnel in enterprises that are relocating. According to this  practice, a joint venture pays an amount in the form of  compensation to a labor service company to discharge the  expenses of training its surplus personnel so that they are  capable of finding jobs again in the labor market. Recently, the  Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company began drawing  up plans to train some 180 off-the-post staff and workers of a  joint venture: The Convenient Foodstuff Factory.     "

Of  that, 60 percent were produced by enterprises held in the state  form of ownership, 38 percent--in mixed ownership, and 2  percent--in municipal and private ownership.    Most industrial enterprises reduced their volumes of  production as compared with January-March of last year. The  decline in production at machine building and light industry  enterprises evokes particular concern: The ""Ishimselmash"" plant  (a decline of 86 percent), the joint-stock companies ""Ishimskiy  Machine Building Plant"" (82 percent), the ""Electromechanical  Plant"" (63 percent), the ""Zavodoukovskiy Machine Building Plant""  (53 percent), ""Krosno"" (57 percent), and the ""Ishimskiy Shoe  Factory"" (by 72 percent). Product output at enterprises of the  ""Russian Timber Merchants"", in the fish and dairy industries and  others has declined by more than one-third.    Enterprises of the ""Gazprom"" concern, AO ""Tyumenenergo,"" PO  ""Yamalneftegazzhelezobeton,"" TOO ""Turbomechanical Plant"" and  others have increased the output of industrial production.    In January-March of this year, the volume of oil and gas  condensate extracted by the oblast's enterprises declined by 8  million tonnes (13.7 percent) as compared with the analogous  period last year.    There was 0.5 percent less natural gas extracted than in  January-March of 1993.    The major gas extracting association Urengoygazprom reduced  its extraction of gas by 4.4 billion cubic meters, or 5.9  percent, as compared with the analogous period last year.    Production volumes of electrical power, synthetic resins and  plastics, wood milling lathes, oil rigs, oil drilling and  geological survey equipment, technological equipment for light  industry, concrete mixers, prefabricated reinforced concrete  structures and parts, building brick and other types of  materials have declined.    At the same time, the rates of decline in the production  volumes of lumber materials and plywood and timbercutting been  reduced slightly as compared with January-February of this year.    Production has increased for diesel fuel, automotive  gasoline, machines for application of mineral fertilizers,  parquet flooring and cement.    The oblast's industrial enterprises produced 31.4 percent  less consumer goods than in the same period last year.     "

The aim of private training programs using ODA funding  has so far been to promote exchanges of technology. But  additional ODA funds will now be used to support a training  program on Japanese industrial property rights, which will be  carried out from this fall by the Japan Institute of Invention  and Innovation [JIII] (an auxiliary organization to the Patent  Office). This is in response to the agreement on Trade Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIP) reached in the  Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which urges  developing countries to establish an industrial property system.  Tokyo plans to assist developing countries mainly in Asia in  establishing the system, thereby exporting Japan's system of  protecting property rights to those countries.    The training program will be carried out mainly by the  Industrial Property Patents and International Cooperation  Training Center, which was established by the JIII on 1 April.    The center will dispatch Japanese private sector patent  specialists to foreign countries and also invite specialists  from foreign companies so that Japan's patent application system  for such products as computer circuits and semiconductors will  take root overseas.    ASEAN will be a main participant in the project. The project  will be funded by a portion of an ODA subsidy (which totals 9  billion yen in fiscal 1993) provided to the Japan Overseas  Development Council (JODC) and the Association for Overseas  Technical Scholarship (AOTS). The subsidy will cover one-third  to one-half of trainees' living expenses during their stay in  Japan.    Developing countries have been trying to establish an  industrial property system following the Uruguay Round  agreement, which obligates them to establish one. The United  States and the European Union have been working to export their  own industrial property systems to developing countries in a bid  to help private companies make inroads into those countries in  the future. Similarly, Japan's training program is aimed at  conforming an industrial property system in Asia to Japan's to  back Japanese companies in making inroads into developing  countries in Asia.     "

Although most of the fall was attributed to a two-day rail strike which led to a drop in coal mining, other key sectors were also lagging. The output of consumer goods fell 0.4 per cent with cuts in car and truck assemblies accounting for about half the total loss. Production of appliances and furniture continued to improve - a sign of the boost given to housing with lower interest rates - but the output of many non-durables, including food and clothing, also declined. The Industrial Production Index had been rising about 0.5 per cent for each of the preceding four months. Although analysts had been expecting a June decline in industrial production, the fall underlined the frailty of the economy and bolstered fears that the recovery might stall or fall into a 'triple-dip' recession. Unemployment, now at 7.8 per cent, is unlikely to show much early improvement, with large numbers of projected lay-offs being announced by the week. Industrial capacity utilisation in June fell 0.4 percentage points to 78.5 per cent. Other reports have indicated similarly lacklustre economic performance, despite sharp reductions in interest rates. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said retail sales went up just 0.5 per cent in June after a 0.4 per cent gain in May. For the second quarter as a whole, production grew at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent, in contrast to the opening period when it shrank by 2.9 per cent.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Shipments also scored the first growth in four quarters with  a 1.9 percent climb, MITI said.    But the readings do not mean Japan's industrial activity  recovered fully, a MITI official said, citing seasonal factors  in the reporting quarter.    In the January-March period last year, industrial output  also  turned higher as corporations stepped up manufacturing activity  before closing their book March 31, the official said.

0,FT932-4305 ,"FT932-4305 _AN-DFJB6AAZFT 930610   FT  10 JUN 93 / Brussels proposes HCFC limits      By ANDREW HILL   THE European Commission wants to set strict limits on the EC's consumption of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which deplete the ozone layer, and end their use by 2014. The Commission yesterday proposed tough restrictions on HCFCs, which are used in the making of foam insulation, and two other ozone-depleting chemicals - adding to a list of limits and bans headed by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). But the Commission is not proposing to outlaw EC production of HCFCs, which could still be exported to developing countries as a substitute for CFCs in refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Use of CFCs has affected the ozone layer, which screens out much ultra-violet radiation, increasing the risk of skin cancer and eye cataracts. HCFCs are 20 times less harmful to the ozone layer than CFCs, but the Commission is still proposing that their use in the EC should be cut to 7,300 tonnes a year from January 1995, and eliminated by 2014. Officials said yesterday the final date might be brought forward if reliable production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the most benign substitute for CFCs, could be established earlier. The plans drew a sharp response from the EC chemicals industry, which criticised the Commission for overreacting when the question of how to limit the more dangerous CFCs had not yet been properly resolved. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EC environment commissioner, hopes the proposals will be approved by EC environment ministers on June 28. He underlined that as in the case of CFCs - the use of which will be outlawed from January 1995 - the Community was improving on the deadlines laid down last November in Copenhagen by the Montreal Protocol, the 93-nation pact on the ozone layer. The Commission also plans to limit the use and production of hydrobromochlorofluorocarbons (HBFCs) and methyl bromides, used for firefighting equipment and soil fumigation respectively. HBFCs will be outlawed by January 1, 1996, while use and production of methyl bromide will be frozen on January 1, 1995 and cut by 25 per cent a year later.

Above him, snipers on top of the 20-storey Mezhdunarodnya building exchanged fire with artillery on the ground. Despite the disruption to business, however, foreign companies were cautiously optimistic about the situation yesterday. They also emphasised that operations outside the Russian capital were largely unaffected. The UK computer company International Computers (ICL), which has been operating in Russia for 25 years, said the expectation among staff and customers was that the situation would soon return to normal. Emergency plans to evacuate staff were in place, but things would have to get 'very much worse' before they were implemented, ICL said. The German chemicals group BASF, which has its office very close to the White House, said its 40 staff had stayed away yesterday. However, work on its two joint ventures in Siberia went on as usual. BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco giant, said: 'We have a staff of 30 in the city, but we have not taken any steps yet to pull them out. They are all staying in their homes for the time being and appear to be safe there.' Flights in and out of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport were unaffected, BA reported yesterday. Russian airspace, the main air corridor between Europe and Japan, was still open. However, BA staff at the airport were staying at nearby hotels last night rather than risk returning to their homes in the city. One western oil company executive said in London yesterday that production was normal at the company's operations in western Siberia. 'We're just carrying out business as usual,' he said. 'We're in Russia for the long term and believe the government will overcome its present problems.' Most companies said their financial exposure to Russia was strictly limited. The engineering contractor Trafalgar House, which has large contracts with the Russian government, said all its Russian business was covered by advance funding. ICL said that on a worst case, the investment it stood to lose in Russia was only Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m.   Companies:-  BASF.     BAT Industries.     ICL.     British Airways.     Trafalgar House.

The business is a market leader in pure lead battery technology used in maintenance-free standby batteries for the data processing and telecommunications industries. It has annual sales of about Dollars 33m and employs 400 people at its manufacturing plant in Warrensburg, Missouri. The deal is a further withdrawal from the batteries market for Gates Energy, which earlier this year sold its nickel-based rechargeable battery business to Ralston Purina's Eveready Battery company. Five years ago BTR's subsidiary, Hawker Batteries, bought Gates' plant in the UK. Yesterday, Mr John Richardson, head of BTR's batteries group, said he expected the pure lead battery technology, developed and patented by Gates, to give BTR a long-term competitive edge.

The industrial arm of Anglo American of South Africa, reported an unexpectedly robust performance in the year to December 31 amid growing signs of recovery in its domestic and overseas markets. The company, whose interests range from chemicals to mining equipment, stainless steel and consumer goods, recorded a 37 per cent jump in pre-tax profit to R647m (Dollars 187m) from R470m, on turnover a third higher at R8.79bn against R6.78bn. The dividend is increased by 7 per cent to 375 cents a share, from 350 centsin 1992. Shareholders have been offered a scrip alternative. A large part of the improved sales reflected an increased shareholding in construction subsidiary LTA. A similar boost is expected in 1994 from an enlarged stake in chemicals supplier AECI. The group's three major unlisted subsidiaries - Scaw Metals, the pulp and paper producer Mondi, and mining equipment supplier Boart - all reported a strong turnround in their main markets in the second half of 1993, with further signs of good domestic and export orders so far thisyear. Net income before abnormal items was up by more than a fifth at R526m, against R354m. Deferred tax credits boosted the bottom line by another R90m. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said the South African economy was heading for growth of at least 4 per cent in 1994. Amic has completed an internal reorganisation to improve financial efficiency and borrowing capacity by maximising the tax base of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Mr Boyd said Amic was embarking on a drive to attract international partners, mainly for new business ventures. In the past year, AECI established a joint venture in explosives with ICI of the UK and entered a partnership with Daewoo, the Korean conglomerate, which is investigating the construction of a R600m colour television tube plant in South Africa.

This was stated by Alviri, secretary of the  Supreme Council for Free Trade and Industrial Zones, in an  exclusive interview with our correspondent. Alviri added: The  import of goods from the free trade zones to other parts of the  country will be subject to import-export regulations.    He described the monetary and banking regulations that were  approved by the Supreme Council for Free Trade and Industrial  Zones yesterday as one of the most important procedural  regulations of the law on free trade zones. He said: Domestic  banks as well as domestic and foreign credit establishments can  be either set or open branches in these zones, while foreign  banks can only have branches in these zones.    The secretary of the Supreme Council for Free Trade and  Industrial Zones also stated that the Iranian banks should have  an initial capital of at least 5 billion rials, while foreign  credit establishments should have at least $4 million to be  established in these zones. Alviri added: Domestic banks and  branches of foreign banks can carry out off-shore banking  activities, which are solely foreign exchange transactions and  will be exempt from the regulations and laws that apply inside  the country.    Alviri added: The banks in the free trade zones should  clarify their situation within a period of six months or conform  their articles of association with the banking and monetary  regulations that apply to these regions. Commenting on the  foreign exchange system that will apply in these areas, he said:    [Begin Alviri recording] Another noteworthy point is the  existence of a single-parity rate in the free trade zone. This  means that we will not have one rate announced by the Central  Bank and another rate that is the free market rate. There will  be a single parity rate system. In other words, the foreign  exchange market in the free trade zones will adjust its rate on  the basis of supply and demand. This will be the official rate  inside the free trade zones and the basis on which all the banks  will carry out their transactions. [end recording]     "

The installed base in France consists of 11,795 robots.    The number of robots installed in 1993 dropped by only 4  percent (974 compared with 1,013 in 1992). The total number of  robots operating in France thus amounts to 11,795 units. This  gave our fellow magazine ROBAUT and the French Industrial  Robotics Association (AFRI) an opportunity to announce the first  upbeat statistics published in a long time. With a warning note,  however, because sales dropped considerably--by 20  percent--after manufacturers engaged in a ""fierce price and  discount battle."" Small to mid-size industries and firms  continued to invest in these automation means, and 407 robots  were installed in their plants in 1993. This is due to the sharp  fall of robot prices (11 percent in 1993 alone).    When the automobile industry sneezes, robotics catches cold:  the depressed market confirmed the saying. For the first time  since these statistics are computed, automobile manufacturers  and their subcontractors accounted for less than 50 percent of  the market (only 46 percent). There is some hope, however.  Several industries claim that they need more robots. The  agrifood industry, for instance, with a 36-percent growth rate  (by number of units), or the electric/electronics industry with  +6 percent, or again the glass/ceramic industry which increased  its purchases fourfold, from 7 to 29 units.    From a technical point of view, four-axis robots and robots  with more than six axes were the most popular with users. The  same was true of robots with Cartesian, spherical, and parallel  axes. Over two thirds of the robots installed in 1993 handle  loads weighing less than 60 kg. Parts handling, remains a major  robot application, although it was hit hard. That was not the  case of pallettization and packaging, a sector which  considerably increased its use of robots, while machine  loading/unloading was far from achieving the same score as in  1992 (it declined by about 50 percent). The feeding of plastics  injection-molding machines made a remarkable leap. On the other  hand, welding (arc welding as well as spot welding) no longer  pays: the number of robots installed is in marked decline. As  for education and research, the number of robots they use  increased threefold.      "

Actually, it uses centrifugal force to achieve  concentrations of up to 50 percent of silicon carbide particles  in its aluminum parts, over a thickness of its choice, and in  parts ranging from 80 mm to 2 m in diameter. This is an original  way of exceeding the 20-percent rate, above which the alloy  becomes too viscous to be cast.    ""When silicon carbide concentrations reach 30 percent, the  aluminum-matrix composite becomes practically insensitive to  friction, its mechanical performance improves, and it can  withstand temperatures as high as 300ëC,"" Luc Lajoye, the  technical manager, explained. This means a tenfold increase of  the application range of light-alloy cylinders. Aerospatiale  already placed a test order for space applications. Sollac also  decided to subject the alloy to severe testing, using it for an  electric collector ring immersed in water heated to over  100ëC.    It was after the completion of the Euram BRITE [Basic  Research in Industrial Technologies for Europe] project,  completed jointly with the Grenoble National Polytechnic  Institute (INPG) at a cost of 12 million French francs [Fr] over  three years, that the PMI developed this knowhow. The  manufacturer makes an aluminum alloy containing 10 percent of  silicon carbide, and centrifuges this alloy to mold it into a  cylinder. Being heavier than aluminum, silicon carbide then  migrates toward the outer perimeter. There, it accumulates in  concentrations of 30, 40 and even 50 percent. ""By varying the  temperature and centrifugation rate, we manage to control the  concentration and thickness of the solidified zone. But we also  vary the particle size (from 10 to 100 fm) to modify the  mechanical strength and wear resistance,"" Luc Lajoye added.  Another distinctive characteristic is that the parts are  strengthened both at the surface and throughout their thickness.  Witness the tests carried out on engine cylinder liners, causing  silicon carbide to migrate and accumulate in a 5-mm thick  homogeneous peripheral zone containing 35-percent silicon  carbide. After the cylinder has cooled, its inside must be  machined to remove about 10 mm and get down to the strengthened  zone. ""Compared with the `Nicasil' surface treatment (using  nickel and silicon carbide), the price is divided by two,"" Luc  Lajoye assured.      "

A check showed that the total tonnage of the industrial  wastes imported from Japan by the Ningbo branch of Haikou  Yongchang Enterprise Company was 1,080 tonnes. Among the  industrial wastes were 300 tonnes of scrapped steel and 780  tonnes of scrapped electric motors and refrigerator compressors.  Toxic materials were found among the imported industrial  wastes. There had been no prior reports on the import of these  industrial wastes to environmental protection departments for  inspection and approval.    Ningbo Environmental Protection Department and Customs had  ordered the Ningbo Branch of Haikou Yongchang Enterprise Company  to stop importing industrial wastes.

The State Statistics Bureau said the country's 357,000 industrial enterprises earned nearly Yn51.3bn (Pounds 5.9bn) from January to May, a 110 per cent increase over the same period last year, the official China Daily newspaper reported. Sales were up nearly 40 per cent to Yn1,104bn and pre-tax profits rose nearly 50 per cent to Yn129.6bn. 'The impressive gains concealed problems that, if not resolved in good time, might drain the economy and stifle market demand,' the bureau was quoted as saying. 'The speed-up in industrial production has been excessive and has created tension between sectors of the economy.' The official Xinhua news agency said efficiency at large and medium-size state enterprises was up 17 per cent. It attributed this to more autonomous management, growth of heavy industry and rising consumption in coastal provinces. Much of the earnings gain came from the enterprises.

The main details are  described below.    The Structure of the Industrial Technology Council's  Industrial Science and Technology Development Section's Meeting    The establishment of a section for each project in the  meeting was agreed to. Since a comprehensive evaluation of the  advanced material processing program, and mid-term evaluations  of advanced chemical processing technology and manufacturing  methods for high performance chemicals (for marine life  activity) are to be performed, an evaluation committee was  established for this purpose.    The Industrial Science and Technology Frontier Program (ISTF)    The purpose of the program was explained and the details of  the research and development were reviewed. It was decided to  extend the research and development period for basic research  and development in the propulsion program for supersonic  transport by two years.    Note:    (1) The Industrial Technology Council was established as an  organization affiliated with MITI on July 25, 1973, with the  task of examining crucial issues related to science and  technology for the mining and manufacturing industry in response  to an inquiry from the Minister of MITI. The head of the Council  is Hiroshi Inose, director of the Japan Information Center for  Science and Technology (JICST).    (2) The Industrial Science and Technology Section, which is  organized as one divisional section, will review the ISTF  Program, which began in 1993.    The ISTF Program    ISTF Office    1. Background    In order to contribute to the advance of fundamental and  original research and development that will contribute to the  future development of industry and society as well as provide  measures to address the quickening pace of society and the aging  society, the former National Research and Development Program  (Large-Scale Project), the Research and Development of Basic  Technologies for Future Industries Project, and the Medical and  Welfare Equipment Technology Development Project were  consolidated in 1993, and a new RD system, the ISTF Program,  begun.    2.

To the layman this would appear to be a huge amount. But the radioactive impact of this release on the most exposed member of the public living near the site is equivalent to that which would take place during a 15-minute flight on a passenger aircraft. The fact that we have such sophisticated measuring devices at Sellafield which can detect such minute amounts should, in itself, be reassuring to the public. Unfortunately, detecting discharges which result in such small dosages requires detailed analysis. That inevitably means a delay between the actual release and its detection. That is why there is a delay in the reporting of such incidents. J R S Guinness chairman, British Nuclear Fuels, Risley, Warrington, Cheshire WA3 6AS   Companies:-  British Nuclear Fuels.

Annual sales are predicted to rise from about 54,000 units in 1993 to more than 103,000 units in 1997. Japan accounts for more than half the world's robot stock, equivalent to 325 robots for every 10,000 manufacturing workers. It is followed by Singapore (109), Sweden (73), Italy (70) and Germany (62). Use of robots is most widespread in the motor vehicle industry, which accounts for between a third and more than one-half of robots in use in countries such as France, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and Britain. Though Japan now has the highest number of robots in the electrical and electronic industry, it remains the world leader by far in the use of robots for vehicle manufacture. In the transport equipment sector, which includes motor vehicles, Japan has 1,000 robots for every 10,000 workers, compared with 167 in Sweden, 110 in France and 63 in Britain. In most countries, especially those with big motor vehicle industries, robots are used most frequently for welding. But in some countries machining is the most common application. In Japan 40 per cent of the robot stock is used for assembly, reflecting the large-scale use of robots in the electronic sector. The potential for expansion of robotics is enormous. Numbers would explode if other industrialised countries were to reach Japan's robot densities and if industry in general were to reach only half the robot density of the motor vehicle sector. If all industries in France and Britain had half as many robots as the motor industry in these countries, the robot stock would more than double. If it reached half the density of the Japanese motor vehicle industry, it would increase more than 20-fold. *World Industrial Robots 1994: Statistics 1983-93 and forecasts to 1997. Sales No. GV.

The Nikkei 225 average ended 154.94, or 0.8 per cent, off at 19,122.22. The index opened at the day's high of 19,232,85 and fell as low as 18,896.48 during the morning session. Investors were worried that the New York stock market would continue to lose ground this week following last week's rise in US long-term interest rates, triggered by firm US labour data. However, market participants were reluctant to sell below the Nikkei 19,000 level due to concern that institutions will come in to support the index. Institutional investors, expected to buy stocks following the turn of the new business year, were absent. Volume stayed flat, at 230m shares, and trading was dom-inated by arbitrage-linked activity. The Topix index of all first section stocks finished 10.80 down at 1,560.38 and the Nikkei 300 declined 1.90 to 285.21. Falls outscored rises by 754 to 254, with 163 issues unchanged. In spite of the rise in the dollar against the yen, high-technology issues were depressed. Matsushita Electric Industrial slipped Y10 to Y1,700 and Sony receded Y40 to Y5,890. Auto makers were also lower, with Nissan Motor losing Y15 at Y814. Arbitrage selling hit banks, Industrial Bank of Japan declining Y10 to Y3,000 and Fuji Bank Y60 to Y2,100. Brokers were lower, Nomura Securities dipping Y30 to Y2,200. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone retreated Y2,000 to Y903,000. Reports that the company may be forced to postpone its increase in city rates, due to the cabinet's concern over the rise in a number of public fees on the economy, prompted selling by some investors. Housing shares were higher on hopes of rising demand. Misawa Homes firmed Y10 to Y1,040 and Daiwa House Industry Y20 to Y1,550. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 189.27 to 21,366.88 in volume of 7.1m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, lost Y100 at Y6,630 on profit-taking. Roundup Wall Street worries gave most of the region a bad day. Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand were closed for holidays. KUALA LUMPUR blamed Wall Street, rather than the central bank's currency losses, as investors liquidated their holdings. The KLSE composite index ended 31.61, or 3.3 per cent, lower at 928.33. Dealers said the market was jittery about the effect of the sharp fall in US bond prices last week on the Dow Industrial average. The day's losers included Genting, Telekoms and Maybank, in thin volumes. Some 114.8m shares worth MDollars 503m were traded. BANGKOK added some domestic political uncertainty, and the SET index closed 35.94, or 2.9 per cent, down at 1,196.59 in wafer thin turnover of Bt2.8bn, against Friday's Bt2.7bn, the lowest of the year. KARACHI noted that foreign funds and local institutions kept to the sidelines as the KSE 100 index fell 62.43, or 2.5 per cent, to 2,448.71 on profit-taking by jobbers. Volume was low, and the jobber selling was described as speculative. MANILA was led down by the big blue chips, Manila Electric and Philippine Long Distance Telephone. Meralco 'B' and PLDT each dipped by about 2 per cent, to 462.50 pesos and 1,700 pesos respectively, as the composite index declined 57.80, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,653.70. SINGAPORE fell in sympathy with the weak US bond market and in the absence of Hong Kong-based fund buying. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 41.78, or 2 per cent, off at 2,039.12. SEOUL staged a technical rebound centred on blue chips, asset play counters and low price/earnings ratio issues, which left the composite index 5.10 up at 860.47. There were rumours that the government may be considering measures to attract foreign investors, but the Finance Ministry denied these and brokers did not foresee an upward trend.

The rate of capacity utilisation in manufacturing rose to 82.8 per cent  - close to the level historically associated with upward pressure on inflation. The Federal Reserve said output in several industries had picked up sharply after weather-related weakness in January and February. But the overall increase in output was held back by a drop in production of motor vehicles following a surge in preceding months. Vehicle output fell to an annual rate of 13m units last month against 13.9m in February, the highest level of output in any month since the 1970s. Industrial output was also depressed in March by a decline in electricity production after an unusually cold winter.

China's Economic Daily said prices of the 16 main industrial raw materials, including steel, timber, rubber, cement and chemicals, rose an average year-on-year 44.7 per cent. Domestic production rose by 13.7 per cent and domestic consumption by 16.2 per cent, while imports leapt 143 per cent. The newspaper put the steep price rises down to rapid economic growth and to the state's 70.7 per cent increase in fixed asset investment during that period. The price increase rose on a year-on-year basis from 31.2 per cent in January to 52.9 per cent in June. Steel product prices rose by 73 per cent in the first half, while consumption rose 33.9 per cent, and production 21.2 per cent. Imports of steel products more than tripled to 11.16m tonnes.

ACTION:     Final rule.              SUMMARY:     As part of the Department of Commerce initiative to streamline export licensing requirements for exports to countries   that are demonstrating increased ability to safeguard reexports of U.S.-origin strategic goods and technology, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is extending to Taiwan export licensing benefits available under the provisions of section 5(k) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA). This action will lessen the administrative burden on U.S. exporters and their foreign customers.         Specifically, BXA is: Providing shorter processing times for license applications for Taiwan; and amending General License GCG to authorize certain shipments of U.S.-origin commodities to Taiwan.     This rule also amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to include new requirements based on the implementation of Import Certificate/Delivery Verification (IC/DV) procedures for Taiwan.     The address for the authority administering the IC/DV system within Romania is also revised by this rule.             DATES:         Effective date:     This rule is effective October 3, 1994.            Grace period:     In lieu of the 45 day grace period provided in 15 CFR 775.10(c)(2), a 90 day grace period will apply to the requirement to obtain the Taiwan Import Certificate to support an export license application.            FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Rodney Joseph, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Telephone: (202) 4820171.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Grace Period        During the 90 day grace period indicated in     DATES    , applications destined for Taiwan will be accepted if supported by a Taiwan Import Certificate from either the Board of Foreign Trade, Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, or the Export Processing Zone Administration, or a Form BXA629P (Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser).           Background         In April, 1994, Taiwan implemented an island-wide IC/DV system. This system extends the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park IC/DV system and makes Taiwan eligible for general license GCG and 15 day/15 day license processing.     The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) requires a foreign importer to file an International Import Certificate (IC) in support of individual validated license applications to export certain commodities controlled for national security reasons to specified destinations. The commodities are identified by the code letter ``A'' following the Export Control Classification Number on the Commerce Control List, which identifies those items subject to Department of Commerce export controls. An IC is an   undertaking by the government of the country of ultimate destination to exercise legal control over the disposition of those commodities covered by an IC.     BXA also requires a Delivery Verification Certificate (DV) on a selective basis, as described in 15 CFR 775.3(i). A DV is issued by the government of the country of ultimate destination after the exported commodities have either entered the export jurisdiction of that country or are otherwise accounted for by the importer.     New documentation practices adopted by Taiwan warrant the inclusion of that country in the IC/DV procedure. This rule amends the EAR by revising Taiwan's entry within the list of countries that issue Import Certificates and by revising the name and address of the Taiwan authorities in the list of foreign offices that administer the IC/DV systems.     The main authority for administering the Taiwan IC/DV program is the Board of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Economic Affairs. There are also two satellite offices: the Science-Based Industrial Park Administration and the Export Processing Zone Administration. If the destination of the export is within the Science-Based Industrial Park or the Export Processing Zone, then one should apply for the IC/DV at the appropriate satellite office.     This rule also revises the Romanian IC/DV authority address to the ``Authorities Administering Import Certificate/Delivery Verification System in Foreign Countries'' table, Supplement No. 1 to Part 775.     Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994.

The proposed modifications are now in  the hands of Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party-Paraiba] and Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party-Parana] -- the rapporteurs of the  Constitution and Justice and Economic Affairs Committees of the  Senate, respectively. The modifications are based on an  agreement approved during the Uruguay round of GATT talks held  in April. The agreement is known as TRIPS (""Trade-Related  Intellectual Property Rights"") [given in English].    Bio-technically, the TRIPS agreement does not impose any  major restrictions on obtaining patents on microorganisms, says  Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao, the National Institute of  Industrial Property (INPI) president. Article 27 of the GATT  agreement states that ""patents will be granted and their rights  will be fully enjoyable, without discrimination over the  involved technological field. Patents may not apply to plants  or animals, but they can apply to microorganisms. In the case  of plants, however, a `sui generis' system can be adopted if  there is no system of patents for plant species.""    This article does not clash with the government suggestion  to  maintain patents on microorganisms but not on plants or animals.    Compulsory licenses: Gusmao said the adjustments  proposed by the government deal with the wording of regulations.  The GATT agreement states that compulsory licenses may be  granted provided they meet domestic market needs, except in  cases of unfair competition as defined by court or  administrative authorities. The agreement adds that the  appropriate authorities may cancel compulsory licenses if the  circumstances that justified the issuance of such licenses  disappear and will probably not reappear. The INPI president  said the bill in the Senate will have to be adjusted as follows:    ""Pipeline"": Article 70 of the TRIPS agreement  provides for a ""pipeline"" system (patent protection on products  being developed and/or those yet to be sold on the Brazilian  market, until the patent in the originating country expires),  even in countries that adopt grace periods before granting the  patent. It also provides for a five-year period of exclusive  sale on such products to prevent imitation.    In case of the ""pipeline"" protection, the government  suggested a modification prepared by Deputy Roberto Freire,  which the Chamber of Deputies did not approve. The government  wants to protect patents that have already been launched abroad,  provided the products -- patented in one or more countries --  have not been sold on the Brazilian market. The text approved  by the Chamber of Deputies says that ""pipeline"" protection will  be granted only to non-patented products.    Domestic manufacture versus imports: Article 27 of the TRIPS  agreement says patents will be granted and their rights fully  enjoyable regardless of the place where the product was invented  or whether the products are imported or locally produced.  Gusmao said this article, which is not very clear, will be  submitted to the new World Trade Organization (WTC). ""Brazil  will respect the WTC decision. The government believes a bill  adjusted to the TRIPS should prevail.    The bill at the Senate conditions a patent to full and  complete production of the patented product in Brazilian  territory, in order to meet domestic market needs, with full use  of the patented process. To assure this ""compulsory local  production,"" the bill provides for the issue of compulsory  licenses to local manufacturers three years after the issue of  the patent.    Gusmao said the government believes ""importation does not  prove the use of the patent."" That is, the patent must be  exploited in Brazil, and not through imports. The government  supports the local exploitation condition, which foments  industrialization.""    Parallel importation: This is the importation of  patented products without the authorization of the patent owner.  Interfarma -- an organization of 39 foreign laboratories -- has  stated that the TRIPS agreement forbids parallel importation.  The government, however, maintains that the GATT agreement  ""says nothing"" about parallel importation. Gusmao said parallel  importation can be admitted only within a common market or a  free-trade zone with reciprocal rights. For example, it will be  authorized in Mercosur [Common Market of the South], through  regulations in the intellectual property rights code of the four  countries. Brazilian, Argentine, Uruguayan, and Paraguayan  authorities analyzed the subject last week.    In its suggested modifications, Gusmao said the government  does not consider parallel importation because it is  inconsistent with the requirement of local exploitation of the  patent.     "

The conferees discussed topics related to developing  and strengthening industrial cooperation between the two  countries, and drafting the necessary decisions and  recommendations that will then be referred to the Joint  Industrial Committee. [passage omitted]    In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, Nasri Khuri said: Today's  meeting of the technical subcommittees is one of a series of  meetings and contacts that these committees are holding to form  the framework of cooperation and coordination between the two  fraternal countries under the provisions of the Treaty of  Fraternity and Coordination and on the basis of the agreements  signed and ratified in accordance with the constitutional  procedures in both countries.    Several committees were formed under the provisions of the  Economic and Social Cooperation Agreement. These committees  are: The ""Joint Industrial Committee,"" which in turn has formed  five technical subcommittees, which are holding their meeting  today; the ""Joint Agricultural Committee,"" which held its  meeting earlier and agreed to establish a subcommittee for  marketing agricultural products, and which will hold its second  meeting on Saturday; the ""Joint Electricity Committee,"" which is  scheduled to meet today, Sunday 13 February; the ""Joint Water  Committee,"" which is discussing several matters relating to  joint waters and which has already held two meetings; the ""Joint  Health Committee"" and the ""Joint Transport Committee,"" which  also held their meetings.    The Joint Economic Committee, which has prepared a general  idea of how to implement the Economic and Social Cooperation  Agreement, will hold its meeting in the middle of next month.    There is also a ""Joint Tourism Committee,"" a ""Communications  Committee,"" a ""Committee for Facilitating Border Procedures,""  and a ""Committee for facilitating Bases for Certificate of  Origin."" We are now in the process of forming a ""Joint  Committee for Labor and Social Affairs"" and a permanent  committee for planning. All these committees are operating  under the supervision of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council and  they submit their results to the Economic and Social Cooperation  Agreement committee, which consists of all the competent and  concerned ministers from both sides in the two fraternal  countries, in order to make the necessary decisions on them  prior to submitting then to the Followup and Coordination  Commission.    We must point out here that within the framework of the  Treaty of Cooperation and Coordination between the fraternal  countries there is a ""Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs,"" and  a ""Joint Committee for Defense and Security."" This is in  addition to the ""Economic and Social Committee."" These  specialized committees, which are stipulated in the treaty, will  begin holding their meetings in a periodic and organized manner  in the near future in order to put the provisions of the  cooperation and coordination agreement into practice and actual  implementation.

The boost to net earnings was helped by a reduction in the Danish corporate profits tax rate from 38 to 34 per cent, a factor in reducing Novo Nordisk's tax to DKr401m from DKr531m in 1991, according to the preliminary report. Earnings per share were up by 26 per cent from DKr27.02 to DKr34.12. An unchanged DKr4 per share (20 per cent) dividend was proposed. Pre-tax profits increased by a more moderate 15 per cent to DKr1.67bn from DKr1.48bn. Sales were ahead by 14 per cent to DKr10.69bn from DKr9.36bn in 1991. The group continued to expand production capacity in both Denmark and abroad, mainly in the US, for its major products, insulin, growth hormone and enzymes, with investment expenditure rising by 45 per cent last year to DKr1.95bn. Trading conditions and instability in the foreign exchange and capital markets may make it difficult to achieve the group's goal of an annual 15 per cent growth in pre-tax income, the report said.

Mr Marc Moret, chairman, said he was confident about the outlook for the year, in spite of the unfavourable economic climate in Europe. 'I can already state that we will be able to look back on a good year. So far, we are well within the framework of budgets set last September, and I can see no reason for any change in the next few months,' Mr Moret said at the group's annual press conference. Mr Rolf Schweizer, vice-president, said all divisions except seeds achieved sales gains in the first quarter, and the 1.4 per cent decline in seeds sales was due to a disposal.

This is a report compiled by an advisory committee for the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry by the Basic Issues  Subcommittee of the Council for Industrial Structure (chaired by  Kotaro Tsujimura). The report designates 12 areas as new and  growing markets: housing, information/communications, energy,  environment, medical/welfare, circulation/distribution, life  culture/leisure, improvement of urban environment, international  exchange, utilization of human resources, support for business,  and new technology for new products. It also recommends further  deregulation and strengthening of the policy to promote  competition in each of these fields. Moreover, it proposes a  shift of the industrial structure away from one dependent on  export industries, such as automobiles and household appliances,  to one determined by domestic demand. It points out that the  smooth transfer of labor among industries is also indispensable  and seeks an active policy for mobility in the labor market.  The Council for Industrial Structure is scheduled to complete  its final report on 16 June. Preceding that, the Council's  Basic Issues Subcommittee will hold a joint meeting on 31 May  with the Special Committee, which is in charge of administrative  arrangements for the final report, and will firm up the outline.    What is noteworthy in the report's content is that the  industrial policy, which up until now has centered on the  supplier (enterprises, public corporations, and so on), is  changed, and a new consumer-oriented point of view is adopted.  As for the hollowing of industries, with the premise of a high  yen and the correction of the domestic-overseas price gap, it  takes the position that we should not worry excessively about  it. That is because ""the move, to some extent, to overseas as  an alternative to importing (hollowing) is a structural  adjustment itself.""    On the whole, the report proposes that policies are  necessary  for: 1) macroeconomic measures which are centered around front-  loaded enforcement of improvements in social overhead capital;  2) microeconomic reforms such as deregulation, correction of the  domestic-overseas price gap, and so on; and 3) smooth  restructuring (restructuring of enterprises), improvement of the  capital procurement market for the growth of new industries, and  so on. If these were to be realized, the real growth rate for  the Japanese economy would be about 3.2 percent annually until  the year 2000. Thereafter, it would be able to maintain about  2.4 percent, and the ratio of the current account surplus to the  gross national product (GNP) would be held to between one and  two percent.    As for housing, among the new/growing markets, it sets a  target for housing costs to be reduced to two thirds of the  current figure (90,000 yen [Y] to Y120,000 per square meter) and  space to be increased by 30 percent (to 40 square meters per  person). This will be done through a review of zoning  regulations and promotion of the introduction of imported  residential buildings which, in turn, will result from reform of  construction standards.    As for the utilization of human resources, to accomodate the  aging population and women's new role in society, the principles  of of the Employment Stability Law's prohibitory regulations  which govern employment agencies are to be reviewed. And at the  same time, the type of jobs to which human resources can be  allocated are to be increased. Further, the tax laws which  involve severance pay and annuities, which have been  disadvantageous for people who change jobs, are to be reformed.  And a diverse employment situation which also includes  non-long term and nonsecure employment is to be developed, and  fluidity in the labor market is to be advanced.    The report takes up deregulation as a significant subject  among new industrial policies. In addition to housing/land,  information/communications, and import promotion, which the  Headquarters for Administrative Reform Promotion is now  studying, the report points out that the field of  finance/securities/insurance should be examined.    Besides deregulation, it mentions the promotion of  competition. It calls for examination of Anti-Monopoly Law  violations as possible causes for a demand to cease undesirable  practices under terms of the Unfair Competition Prevention Law.  Furthermore, it advocates review of prohibitory rules for  bonafide share-holding companies and of merger regulations.  Further, it seeks to improve the corporation partition  provision of the Commercial Law, and to simplify procedures for  the merger/transfer of operations.    As for the nurturing of new industries, it says that reform  of the finance/capital market is indispensable for  diversification of capital fund procurement measures.     "

The ministry said decline in household consumption reflected the sharp increase in spending in April. Household consumption in April grew by a revised 1.8 per cent, partly reflecting government incentives for car buyers. Economists in Paris said spending in May was still 0.6 per cent higher than March and 1.1 per cent higher than the average for the first quarter. Even with flat consumption in June, they said second-quarter consumption should still show an increase of 1.5 per cent over the first three months. John Ridding, Paris Dutch seasonally adjusted manufacturing production fell 2.0 per cent in April compared with March, but non-seasonally adjusted manufacturing production was up 1.9 per cent year-on-year, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. Swedish gross domestic product rose by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 from the fourth quarter of 1993 and by 1.4 per cent compared with the first quarter of 1993, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.

The  figures also indicate that the number of domestic and foreign  industrial firms in Morocco stands now at 6,100.    The figures indicated that the rate of growth exceeded 7  percent in the dehydrated and canned food industries and  amounted to 8 percent in the paper industry. It was 11 percent  in construction materials, 16 percent in tobacco and beverages,  and between 3 and 5 percent in the remaining conversion  industries.    An official at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry   Privatization in Rabat told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that approximately  351,000 workers are now employed as permanent workers in the  conversion industries, and 86,000 workers are employed in those  industries on a seasonal basis. The total number of workers,  which is 437,000, represents about a 3-percent increase over the  total number of employed workers last year.    The ministry official said that total investments in the  conversion industries rose by about 14 percent to DH9 billion.  He added that a worker's average rate of productivity stands now  at DH103,000. The industries with the highest returns are the  tobacco and beverage industries where average worker production  stood at DH980,000. In the pharmaceutical, food, and chemical  industries, average productivity in those industries stood at  DH339,000.    The ministry official said that production at the  government's industrial firms now amounts to about 27 percent of  total industrial production. He added that firms engaged in the  production of food, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals produce about  three-quarters of the total output produced by the government's  industrial firms.    The ministry official [also] said that the value of  industrial exports rose by 4 percent to about DH29 billion. That  is equal to about 63 percent of industrial imports. He said that  the most important export industries were the chemical and  pharmaceutical industries (24 percent of the total), the textile  industry (23 percent), and the food processing industry (19  percent).    The ministry official added that the number of exporting  firms stands at 1,600, a figure which represents about 28  percent of the total number of industrial firms. He said that  these firms contribute more than half the industrial production  and employ about 60 percent of industrial workers.    The number of firms in which foreign investors have a share  stands at about 1,000. These firms produce approximately  one-third of total industrial production.    Investment by foreign capital in the conversion industries  amounts to about 15 percent of total investment in those  industries. The value added to conversion industries stands at  about DH36 billion. That is about 15 percent of the total  domestic added value.     "

ACTION:     Notice of availability.                 SUMMARY:     The proposed action is the disposal of the Pontiac Storage Activity (PSA) Pontiac, Michigan. The 32-acre site is closed and maintained in a caretaker condition. The Army considers PSA unencumbered, meaning no conditions or restrictions have been placed on the PSA property for transfer. A Statement of Condition was issued by the Department of the Army on August 11, 1993, which stated that the site has been fully restored and is available for reuse. The screening process has been completed for PSA with the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, the McKinney Act, and state and local agencies. The City of Pontiac was the only organization showing interest in the PSA property.        As part of PSA's disposal, the Army has worked with Federal, state and local entities in order to identify three reasonable reuse options for the reuse of PSA. These alternatives were evaluated against PSA's existing baseline condition in order to determine an environmentally sound and socioeconomically beneficial use for the property. The baseline was described as the environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the site in caretaker status. The three alternatives considered included: (1) Light Industrial and Commercial; (2) Light Industrial and Warehouse; and (3) the No-Action Alternative, as required by National Environmental Policy Act and AR 2002. Alternative 1, Light Industrial and Commercial, is the local community's preferred reuse of the site.    Alternative 1 was chosen over Alternatives 2 and 3 because it provides the greatest economic benefits for the state and local community, while having no significant impact on the natural or human environment. While Alternative 2, Light Industrial and Warehouse, has even less impact on the human and natural environment than Alternative 1, it does not provide the most beneficial economic gain. Alternative 3, the No-Action Alternative, would provide no economic benefits to the area and no benefit to the Federal government. The property would remain under the care of the Army and may experience some deterioration of buildings and overgrowth of grounds.    Placing the property into the local economy would create revenues for the state and local tax base. In addition, implementation of Alternative 1 would have a positive effect on the regional economy by creating as many as 250 new jobs and increasing local sales volumes. It would not have a significant impact on the population or housing market, public services, and infrastructure. Land use would be compatible with the current zoning of the site. Local traffic flow may be altered in the immediate vicinity of the facility when compared with baseline conditions, but would require only minor mitigative measures to lessen impacts to traffic and transportation. Additional traffic signals and entrances to the site would alleviate impacts to local traffic.    The environmental resources affects associated with the disposal would be insignificant. The topography or geology of the site would not be affected under the proposed activities. Additional parking requirements may cause minor disturbances to soils and loss of vegetative cover, but the impacts would be minor. Water resources would not be affected under the disposal. It is anticipated that the ambient air quality would not be significantly impacted nor the National Air Quality Standards levels would be exceeded. No hazardous materials nor waste generation is expected. However, if they are included in the reuse, the appropriate regulatory requirements would be met. Plant and animal resources effects are expected to be insignificant. No wetlands, threatened and endangered species, and cultural resources exist within the boundaries of PSA. Noise levels are not anticipated to be above background levels and the aesthetic value of the site is expected to remain the same.    Based on the environmental and socioeconomic impact analysis in the Environmental Assessment for the Disposal and Reuse of Pontiac Storage Activity, which is incorporated into this Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI), it has been determined that the disposal of real property and its subsequent reuse would not have a significant impact on the quality of the natural or human environment. Because there would be no significant environmental or socioeconomic impacts resulting from implementation of the proposed action, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required and will not be prepared.

In addition to the private-sector shipyards, there are currently eight Navy-owned shipyards and two Navy-owned ship repair facilities [U.S. Industrial Outlook, 1993].   Employment in the shipbuilding and repair industry_as high as 184,000 in 1981_was 118,000 in October 1992 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS, 1993]. Employment has also declined in government-owned shipyards. In 1990 the five largest firms employed 81,000 workers while the 12 largest firms (all with at least 1,000 workers) employed 98,000 workers [Dept. of Transportation, 1990].   The largest percentage of asbestos work is performed in major shipyards [OSHA, 1991 (Ocken, p. 395)]. OSHA and CONSAD identified a range of 13 to 23 major shipyards as potentially affected by the revision to the asbestos standard [OSHA, 1994]. These establishments employ approximately 74,000 to 80,500 workers, of which an estimated three percent, or 2,220 to 2,415 workers, perform maintenance and repair activities [RTI, 1985; OSHA, 1994].   As shown in Table 2, OSHA analyzed impacts in two areas of ship repair: wet removal/repair and dry removal/repair. Dry removal and repair occur in ship compartments, such as in nuclear powered vessels, where wet methods are infeasible. Based on OSHA and CONSAD's profile of the ship repair industry, OSHA estimates that 18 shipyards, employing 985 workers, are affected by the revised standard.       Market conditions in the shipbuilding industry.     During the 1980s, the shipbuilding industry experienced a sharp decline in output due to (1) competition from subsidized foreign shipbuilders; (2) decreased demand for new ships caused by excess supply; (3) the elimination of some subsidies for U.S. shipbuilders; and (4) a relaxation of the requirements for foreign ships entering the U.S. commercial fleet. No commercial ships were built in the United States between 1985 and 1990, and only four have been built or under construction since 1990. However, due to the requirements of the Jones Act, American shipyards still build all vessels used in domestic commerce_smaller ships, barges, and tugboats. Industry forecasts also predict that the demand for commercial ships will ``increase significantly'' during the 1990s due to the need for replacement of an aging world merchant fleet [U.S. Industrial Outlook, 1993]. It remains to be seen what fraction of this business may be won by U.S. shipbuilders.   In contrast to the declining market for commercial ship construction, the market for ship repair and conversion work is strong. The U.S. Industrial Outlook reports that ``the demand for some ship repair services *** exceeds what is currently available in certain areas.'' In addition, investments by U.S. shipyards to improve, expand, and modernize repairing facilities are proceeding. Investment in fiscal year 1992 was $215 million, contrasted with $176 million for purchases of plant, machinery and equipment in 1991 [U.S. Industrial Outlook, 1993].       Asbestos in Construction       The construction industry is the principal market for asbestos materials and products in the United States, accounting for 68 percent of the asbestos consumed in 1992 [Bureau of Mines, 1993]. Asbestos products used in construction include asbestos-cement pipe, asbestos-cement sheet, coatings, compounds, packings, and roofing products.  With the decline in consumption of raw asbestos in U.S. manufacturing coupled with the introduction of asbestos substitutes into product design, the asbestos construction industry has shifted away from activities associated with installing asbestos products. Instead, in the last decade concern over the public risk presented by damaged asbestos in place, as well as the practical need to maintain aging interior sections in commercial and residential buildings, has directed the asbestos construction industry to the areas of demolition, removal, and renovation. In addition, custodial personnel occasionally come into contact with asbestos during their housekeeping duties.   The construction industry is comprised of a large number of firms: approximately 536,300 establishments in 1987, employing just over 5 million workers [Dept. of Commerce, 1990b]. Of this industry total, 423,500 establishments, or 79 percent, employed fewer than 10 workers, while only 9.3 percent had 20 or more employees. The prevalence of small firms is partially related to the ease of entry into the construction industry. To establish a construction firm generally requires minimal capitalization; many firms, in fact, achieve success by carrying little overhead and adapting their services to industry trends. Furthermore, a sizable share of proprietorships in the industry are composed of self-employed individuals who contract their own services, and who shift back and forth from employee status to self-employment status as opportunities change.   In construction, unlike manufacturing, the typical industry end-product is highly differentiated and is produced at a site selected by the purchaser. Due to this degree of product specificity, each worksite usually has its own pattern of material use, building methods, and number and mix of workers. Thus, considerable variation may exist in actual worker use of, or contact with, asbestos materials and products. Although the occasional use of asbestos products appears to be the norm_particularly given the changing material use patterns in new construction_some workers (e.g. asbestos pipe installers and abatement/removal specialists) continually come into contact with asbestos materials and products.   Worker mobility, resulting in considerable shifting among both job sites and employers is another characteristic of the industry. Workers tend to identify with their craft or occupation, not with their employer [Lange and Mills, 1979]. Cyclical changes in the economy and seasonal work patterns cause variability of job opportunities, with a large portion of workers frequently entering and exiting the industry. Collectively, these factors make it very difficult to estimate the total number of workers exposed to asbestos and the duration of their exposure.   Based upon profiles of the asbestos construction industry by OSHA and CONSAD [OSHA, 1994; CONSAD, 1990], OSHA in this final RIA has estimated the number of construction workers potentially exposed in the areas affected by the standard_that is, where asbestos products are installed, replaced, removed, or managed in place. Affected construction activities are found within the following general sectors: new construction; abatement and demolition; building renovation and remodeling; routine maintenance; and custodial work. Table 3 presents OSHA's profile of the population at risk from occupational exposure to asbestos in construction.

According to data released by the council, the technology  development capability of Taiwan industries is only one-13th  that of Japanese industries. On the scale, which sets America's  technology development capability at 100, Taiwan industries  score just 4.14 points, slightly higher than South Korea's 3.66  points, but lagging far behind Japan's 55.22 and Germany's 21.37  points, the council said.    Council officials attributed the strong competitiveness of  Japan's small and medium-sized industrial enterprises to the  full governmental support and financial assistance they receive.    Subsidies provided by the central or local government for  research and development projects of Japanese small and  medium-sized industrial enterprises are generally about 50  percent of each project, and sometimes more than 65 percent.  Public banks in Japan also offer special low-interest loans for  small and medium-sized enterprises' RD projects.    In addition, 7 percent of their annual RD budgets are  tax  deductible, the officials noted, adding that cooperation between  public research and academic units and the private sector is  another major factor that helps boost the technological  performance of Japanese industries, the officials said.

In situations where these mixtures are a combination of class I and II chemicals, they may serve as transitional chemicals because they offer environmental advantages in that they have a lower combined ODP than use of a class I compound by itself. However, where EPA has identified a non-ozone depleting alternative that reduces overall risk to human health and the environment, mixtures of class I and II substances shall be unacceptable or subject to use limits.       There have been a few instances in which mixtures of class I and II chemicals have been marketed as replacements for class II chemicals. Because the ODP of such alternatives is clearly higher than the class II substances, the Agency is prohibiting the use of any class I and class II mixture as a replacement for a class II chemical. Where the Agency is aware of specific mixtures falling into this category, they are listed by individual use sector below. The remainder of this section presents the initial listing decisions for each of the following end use sectors:              D. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning   E. Foam Blowing   F. Solvents Cleaning   G. Fire Suppression and Explosion Protection   H. Sterilants   I. Aerosols   J. Tobacco Expansion   K. Adhesives, Coatings and Inks       D. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning       1. Overview       The refrigeration and air conditioning sector includes all uses of Class I and Class II substances to transfer heat. Most end-uses in this sector involve mechanically moving heat from a cool region to a warmer one. For example, a car's air conditioner moves heat from the cooled interior to the hot ambient air.     This sector also includes heat transfer end-uses, i.e. those uses of Class I and Class II substances to move heat from a warm region to a cool one. For example, CFC114 is currently used to remove excess heat from a very hot uranium enrichment process to cooler ambient air. Hence, the process requires no additional energy, and does not create refrigeration by mechanical means.       Mechanical systems generally use a vapor compression cycle. However, several alternative cycles have been used for decades; these and other alternatives are being re-examined in light of the phaseout of commonly used CFC-based refrigerants in 1996. Substitutes reviewed under SNAP may use alternative cycles; review is not restricted solely to applications based on replacing the working fluid in vapor compression equipment. Similarly, simple heat transfer end-uses will also be included.     The refrigeration and air conditioning sector is divided into the following end-uses:     Commercial comfort air conditioning;   Industrial process refrigeration systems;   Industrial process air conditioning;  Ice skating rinks;   Uranium isotope separation processing;   Cold storage warehouses;   Refrigerated transport;   Retail food refrigeration;   Vending machines;   Water coolers;   Commercial ice machines;   Household refrigerators;   Household freezers;   Residential dehumidifiers;   Motor vehicle air conditioning;   Residential air conditioning and heat pumps; and   Heat transfer.   EPA has not necessarily reviewed substitutes in every end-use.   The following discussion provides some distinctions among the various end-uses in the refrigeration and air conditioning sector.     a.     Chillers.     CFCs are used in several different types of mechanical commercial comfort air conditioning systems, known as chillers. These chillers cool water, which is then circulated through a building. They can be classified by compressor type, including centrifugal, reciprocating, scroll, screw, and rotary. The selection of a particular compressor type generally depends on the cooling capacity required. Reciprocating and scroll compressors are used in small capacity applications (less than 200 tons), screw compressors are used in medium capacity applications (50 to 400 tons), and centrifugal compressors are used in large capacity applications (greater than 300 tons). The majority of the chillers used in the United States are centrifugal chillers. Chillers have a lifetime of 23 to 40 years. EPA anticipates that over time, existing cooling capacity will be either retrofitted or replaced by systems using non-CFC refrigerants in a vapor compression cycle or by alternative technologies.     b.     Industrial process refrigeration systems.     Many industrial applications require cooling of process streams. These applications include systems designed to operate in a wide temperature range. Included within this category are industrial ice machines and ice rinks. The choice of substitute for specific applications depends on ambient and required operating temperatures and pressures.       c.     Ice skating rinks.     Skating rinks frequently use secondary refrigeration loops. They are used by the general public for recreational purposes.     d.     Industrial process air conditioning.     Ambient temperatures near 200 degrees Fahrenheit and corrosive conditions make this application distinct from commercial and residential air conditioning. Units in this end-use provide comfort cooling for operators and protect process equipment.     e.     Uranium isotope separation processing.     This end-use includes operation of a heat transfer cycle to cool uranium isotope separation processing. Substitutes must meet an extremely rigorous set of criteria to be applicable in this end-use.

Analysis of the plasmid profiles indicated an absence of  plasmids 45-54 TPN in size in several mutants. From studying  these mutants, the authors were able to identify the plasmids  containing the genes for lactose, sucrose, and fructose  fermentation in these microorganisms. Two strains, L.  lactis lactis 90 and L. lactis cremoris ROM,  were identified in which the mutants, deficient in lactose  utilization, experienced phage resistance spectrum changes; in  both cases, the changes consisted of the appearance of phage  sensitivity with respect to various phages. In L. lactis  lactis 90, the genes corresponding to lactose utilization  and the genes participating in phage resistance control were  apparently located on the 53.7 TPN plasmid. This work was  completed, in part, with resources supplied by the Russian State  Scientific and Technical Program ``Priority Directions in  Genetics.''

The principal components of the  pollution over the past 50 years have been compounds of sulfur,  nitrogen, copper, arsenic, and lead. The study involved six  sectors -- three with stands of the pine, three with stands of  the spruce. The sectors were 4, 15, and 25 km from the plant.  Biometric characteristics of the stands fell the closer the  study was to the plant. The atmospheric pollution was found to  have a greater effect on the growth processes of the spruce.  Electrophysiological studies indicated that the conductive  properties of the trees were reduced and that the membrane  system for the transport of water and ions in the tree trunks  (the site of placement of the electrodes) was poorly developed.  Overall, the spruce appeared to be more sensitive to the  pollution than did the pine. References 12: 9 Russian, 3 Western.      "

BNFL, in its submission to the government's review of radioactive waste policy, says this would be the most cost-effective way of dealing with the problem and offers itself for the part. It says: 'BNFL believes that we can, and should, play a major role in this area provided that it does not require us to accept risks which are incompatible with our commercial status.' BNFL supports the main proposals in the consultation document put out by the government in August, which favoured placing most of the UK's more radioactive waste underground. The company says, however, that it has the capacity to hold waste above ground for some years if deep disposal plans are put back. BNFL appeals to the government to pay attention to the costs of waste regulation so that its international competitiveness is not impaired. In another submission to the review the UK Atomic Energy Authority puts itself forward to manage the decommissioning of nuclear installations. Mr Derek Pooley, the chief executive, said this proposal would ensure decommissioning would be 'properly planned and co-ordinated over a long period'.   Companies:-  British Nuclear Fuels.

The survey of 350 workplaces, carried out by the Industrial Society, found that employers were failing to make changes to comply with new health and safety legislation. The report found that only 43 per cent of employers had held a fire drill in the past six months. While nearly three-quarters of the respondents regularly employed contractors, only half included health and safety in the contract or checked the contractor's record on health and safety. Fewer than half monitored contractors' safety performance or imposed penalties for safety lapses. Employers are also reacting slowly to new health and safety regulations which require a written workplace policy on risk assessment, the report says. A year after the regulations came into force only half the organisations questioned had introduced a policy. In contrast almost three-quarters of the respondents had developed new safety policies for visual display units and 60 per cent of those were giving staff training. Mr David Wood, the Industrial Society safety specialist who carried out the survey, said a lack of enforcement officers was allowing many organisations to escape prosecution.

A year ago,  industrial decline stood at 19.3 percent. Russia's State  Statistics Committee told Interfax that the rate of industrial  decline had increased from 23.1 percent to 24.1 percent in  February, and to 27.4 percent in March. In experts' estimate,  volumes of production are being increasingly determined by  demand, not by the availability of resources which was typical  over the previous couple of years.    Production stoppages occurred at almost 5,000 enterprises.  However, whereas at the beginning of last year stoppages were  mostly due to shortages of components, raw materials and fuel,  in the first quarter of 1994 stoppages were caused by the  absence of demand. In the consumer sector, for instance, it is  difficult to sell products because of the population's  re-orientation to imported goods.    The fuel and energy branches have reduced the production of  oil and coal by 9-15 percent (the production of gas remaining  stable), machine-building and light-industry enterprises have  cut down production almost two times, the chemical industry by  25-30 percent, steel industry by 20-25 percent and food industry  by 10-20 percent. In the first quarter of the year, Russia  produced 75.7 Mn [million] tonnes of oil, which is 15 percent  down from the volume produced during the same period last year.     "

The Act now requires that U.S. firms entering into contracts for the sale of weapons systems or defense-related items to foreign countries or foreign firms that are subject to offset agreements exceeding $5,000,000 in value to   furnish information regarding such sales to the Secretary of   Commerce (the Secretary). The Act also now requires the Secretary to establish regulations to collect this information and to protect it from public disclosure unless public disclosure is specifically authorized by the firm furnishing the information. The Act further requires the Secretary to serve as the President's executive agent in preparing an annual report to Congress on the impact of offsets on the United States.     This report will include an aggregated summary of information provided to the Secretary by U.S. industry pursuant to the regulation proposed here. It will address the impact of offsets on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade of the United States.         Rulemaking Requirements       1. This proposed rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866.   2. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 5 to 60 hours per response, with an average of 10 hours, including time for reviewing   instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the   collection of information.

This proposed rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.   4. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is anticipated that the rule will primarily affect large defense contractors that engage in offset agreements with foreign governments. Moreover, the rule is not expected to pose a burden because firms engaging in offset transactions already   must prepare periodic accounts of progress toward fulfillment of offset obligations for the foreign entity that is party to the offset agreement. The information to be collected pursuant to   these regulations is less than that required by these foreign parties. With regard to new offset agreements entered into, the information requested is readily available and will take a minimum amount of time to assemble by the parties involved.   5.

The agency lowered IBJ's senior debt rating from AA minus from A plus, while LTCB's senior debt ratings were cut from A to A minus. SP said substantial write-offs will ultimately be necessary by IBJ to resolve its bad loans to housing loan companies. However, the write-off process has been limited due to IBJ's earnings levels and the limit on the sales of its cross-shareholding portfolio. LTCB's downgrade reflects the large amount of restructured loans, or loans on which the bank has lowered or waived interest to help restructuring, on top of Y731bn in non-performing loans. Meanwhile, SP has also downgraded the claims-paying ability ratings of four non-life insurance companies and two life assurers. Japan's non-life insurance sector is suffering from reduced profitability due to higher loss ratios, insufficient premium rates and greater catastrophe costs. Increased competition is also expected to hurt the country's life assurers. The claims-paying ability ratings of Chiyoda Fire  Marine, Dai-Tokyo Fire  Marine, Nichido Fire  Marine, Nippon Fire  Marine, Yasuda Mutual Life and Meiji Mutual Life were downgraded to AA plus from AAA.

It said production was up 0.6 per cent, compared with a fall of 1.8 per cent in May and an initial June estimate, released late last month, which showed neither growth nor decline. The upward revision is further evidence that a cautious revival may be in process after the country's longest post-war recession. Output was up by a seasonally adjusted 2.7 per cent compared with May. Miti had previously put that figure at 2 per cent. Officials warned that July data could show a fall both on a month-on-month and year-on-year basis. Drought is disrupting water supplies to high-volume users such as the chemicals industry, and overall inventory adjustments have not ended. Of individual sectors, machinery lagged, with shipments down and stocks up. Many consumer industries are benefiting from the hot weather, and Miti singled out demand for sake as a factor in the strong June performance.

The project, which has cost the government NT [new Taiwan]  $6  billion (US$222.22 million) since it started four years ago, has  successfully developed the technology used in the manufacture of  16- megabyte dynamic random-access memory chips and  four-megabyte static random-access memory chips.    ""Transferring the hard-won technology to a private company  would be the best approach to get back the research funds,"" an  official with the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said.    According to the proposal presented by the IDB, the  state-of-the-art technology, together with an experimental  integrated-circuit factory in the Hsinchu Science-Based  Industrial Park, will be transferred to a new privately run  company, in which the government will have a 49 percent stake.    Local enterprises are welcome to bid to take the remaining  51  percent stake in the company, the IDB official said, adding that  prospective investors are required to submit their bids before  June 30.    All the bidders will be judged by not only bidding prices  but  their management and marketing plans, as well as their financial  status, according to the official.    The evaluation will be completed in early September. A  joint-venture agreement will be signed within a month after the  winning bid is made public on Sept. 8.     "

The rise of 41 to 1236p on healthy turnover of 4.4m shares was, however, inspired by US buying rather than new information. US brokerage houses PaineWebber and Goldman Sachs were both bidding aggressively for stock. UK analysts said they had discovered no new causes for optimism in the prospectus and many argued that by the close ICI shares were at best very fairly valued. In fact the performance was a sign of things to come, being more driven by reconsideration of the pharmaceuticals sector than corporate fundamentals. The reconsideration was prompted by an easing of fears over US drug price reforms. There were reports that Ms Donna Shalala, new US secretary of health and human services, had reacted favourably to a proposal by Merck, the world's largest pharmaceuticals group, that prices should be held to within one percentage point of inflation. This compared to some estimates of 30 per cent price cuts and helped stocks pick up across the board. Glaxo moved ahead 19 to 599p, Wellcome added 30 at 764p and SmithKline Beecham gained 24 to 468p in the 'A's.

Therefore, how a state or  organization steals or protects secrets demonstrates its overall  management ability. And it often serves as a key factor  determining victory or defeat.    In the Sixth Republic era, President No Tae-u and Kim  Yong-sam, then chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP],  frequently waged such war against each other. The first  confrontation came in about April 1990, shortly after the  three-party merger. At the time, Pak Chol-on, then minister of  state, who was wielding real power as President No's virtual  alter ego, fired the first shot with his remark: ""If I open my  mouth ...."" Kim Yong-sam responded by facing President No at  Chongwadae over a Manila envelope he carried with him. Taking  out a document from the envelope, he said to the president,  ""Such covert operations against me...! I might as well take to  the streets and die at the hands of people, but not at your and  your men's hands.""    The document he pulled out was a top-secret plan concerning  a  so-called operation to incapacitate YS [Kim Yong-sam], which  President No had been briefed about by So Tong-kwon, director of  the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP], a few days  earlier and which he asked his chief secretary, No Chae-pong, to  study. The president was so shocked that he sent for his  physician following YS's departure. NSP Director So lost face  with the president and No Chae-pong, the chief secretary, came  under a secret NSP investigation. Chongwadae staff would recall  that the incident made President No realize, with fear, YS's  terrible destructive power for the first time.    In another round, YS found himself the loser. In the summer  of 1991, he went to Cheju, ostensibly on vacation. While there,  he staged, in part openly, a demonstration demanding an early  nomination by the president for him as the DLP's presidential  candidate. President No had repeatedly cautioned YS to refrain  from raising issues relating to a political agenda as the  president still had 19 months to serve. And this defiance by YS  infuriated the president.    President No called in YS, who had just returned from Cheju,  to show him a document--a list of campaign pledges prepared by a  research institute run by YS' close aide. The list began with ""I  will thoroughly liquidate the military culture.""    ""Do you think that you should be allowed to do things like  this already?"" President No demanded. The revelation enraged YS.  He summoned the aide and told him to ""get lost--to America or  wherever.""    There was a time YS implicitly showed off his information  gathering power to President No. In about September 1991, when  Chongwadae and the NSP were unaware of opposition merger  negotiations under way between Kim Tae-chung and Yi Ki-taek, the  president heard for the first time what was going on from YS at  one of their weekly meetings. The result was that the president  took action against the NSP officials concerned, censuring them  for the blunder. ""No one knows better about Kim Tae-chung than I  do,"" said YS to the president, with evident pride.    Leaks of secrets in the Sixth Republic were so bad that  people called the Administration a ""water-like government.""  Former President Chon Tu-hwan, then in exile at Paektamsa, a  Buddhist temple, was fully aware of visible and invisible  pressures which Chongwadae and the NSP were then applying on him.    A typical case was the ""Lake Leman plan"" designed to banish  Mr. Chon overseas against his wishes to return to his Yonhuidong  home. Upon discovering the plan, Mr. Chon, taking it as the last  straw, phoned to President No protesting vehemently. He also  kept a recording of the telephone conversation.    Espionage war like this waged between the present and former  state leaders shows how easily core secrets and information of  the government can be leaked in a climate that mixes up public  and private interests. At the same time, it raises concern over  the fact that our state secrets are being utilized more as tool  of internal power struggle than for national security, because  the loophole can lead to leaks of national security secrets.    Chongwadae is said to be extremely sensitive to security  these days in the wake of a secret visit to Korea of James  Woolsey, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),  which was exposed by press photos. There was also a case of a  Korean military officer on active duty leaking military secrets  to a Japanese correspondent. In yet another case, information on  a top-secret strategic process in the North-South dialogue was  exposed by an opposition assemblyman. Chongwadae's concern over  the continued divulgences is understandable.    It is a matter of course that each nation has its secrets  that, for the sake of protecting and preserving its security and  interests, cannot be divulged to others. Especially in advanced  countries, national security and diplomatic secrets,  confidential internal memos and personnel regulations of  administrative organizations, and business and personal secrets  are strictly excluded from the objects of the freedom of  information by law. At the same time, there are established  criteria governing what are state secrets and who should protect  them, as well as the balance of the freedom of information and  that of speech.    In comparison, Korea seems to have many problems with its  management of state secrets, in principle and in ability.  Deplorable indeed are abuses of such secrets for the mere  convenience of the ruler, the slack discipline and the lack of  ethical standards in this country, as seen in the Sixth Republic  case of a Chongwadae senior presidential secretary for  diplomatic and security affairs--a symbol of national security  itself--who could easily seek asylum overseas.    If the present civilian government can restore the control  of  state secrets to where it belongs by correcting the flaws and  disorder of the Sixth Republic, and without curtailing the  people's right to know, the accomplishment will by itself save  the regime from criticism of ""incompetency.""    It can be said that the teaching of Han Feizi that ""plans  succeed when secrets are kept, conspiracies fail when secrets  leak"" is a wise saying touching at the cardinal point of  information control capability.

The Union is  seeking the six-month delay because of marked imbalances between  the Argentine and Brazilian economies. ""If protective measures  are not taken,"" it warns, ""Argentine productive activity will be  totally replaced by Brazilian imports.""    Seven Asymmetries    Argentine manufacturers point to at least seven areas in  which there are cost differences compared with their Brazilian  counterparts.    These are the so-called ""asymmetries,"" the euphemism used to  avoid mention of something even more formidable: the advantages  which Brazil extends to all manufacturers to help them penetrate  the Argentine market.    The Argentine Industrial Union's missive spells out a few,  while avoiding the mention of a source of irritation to Minister  Domingo Cavallo: Nowhere is any reference made to the gap  between the Argentine rate of exchange and the constant  devaluation in Brazil. It merits only passing mention even  though it is the favorite argument used by Itamar Franco's  government to counter demands made by Argentine industry.    The UIA cites the following Brazilian economic factors that  affect Argentine manufacturers:    1) the enormous difference in the cost of electric power,  which the UIA believes has resulted from the failure to amortize  government investments in the hydroelectric plants that generate  over 90 percent of all electricity used in Brazil;    2) the extremely high rate of tax evasion, which Brazilian  authorities put at a minimum of 55 percent;    3) competition between Brazil's states to attract  investments  by granting high tax exemptions to investment and production  projects;    4) the lag in real wages;    5) financial benefits for exporters that charge the daily  exchange rate while paying for consumable expenditures,  services, raw materials, and personnel at the old rate;    6) the existence of subsidies in certain cases where raw  materials are supplied by government-owned enterprises; and    7) long-term financing for sales of capital goods at very  low  interest rates.    For the first time, the association of Argentine businessmen  has demanded officially that the government temporarily suspend  all of the central issues of the integration treaty with Brazil.    The drastic and unusual request is included in a document in  which the Argentine Industrial Union warns of a grave danger to  the entire Argentine economy. It emphasizes that if special  safeguards are not put in place, ""productive activity will be  totally replaced by Brazilian imports"" in many manufacturing  sectors.    Brandishing these dramatic arguments based on the manifest  economic imbalances of Brazil and the productive disadvantages  of our own national industry, the manufacturers are urgently  demanding drastic measures to check the wave of Brazilian  imports.    In other words, they are asking for time and do so in the  following terms: ""It is imperative that we draft necessary  amendments or extend the transitional period provided for in the  treaty, which essentially grants sufficient time so that our  main Mercosur partner may make indispensable adjustments in  order to coordinate its macroeconomic policies with the  remaining countries.""    The demands are included in a letter which the Argentine  Industrial Union has sent to the head of the Ministry of Economy.    The five-page letter is dated 18 November and spells out the  negative effects suffered by Argentine business. Jorge Blanco  Villegas delivered the letter to Minister Domingo Cavallo in  person.    It states textually that: ""It is our view that the  deep-rooted asymmetries currently existing between Argentina and  Brazil and which are commercially favorable to the latter will  increase immediately, aggravating the problems and harm suffered  by many Argentine industries.""    The manufacturers therefore ask that ""play be halted""  throughout the process of integration with Brazil. They are  specifically asking for a general postponement lasting  approximately six months.    They do so straightforwardly: ""We propose to set a period  ending on 30 June 1994 (rather than 31 December) in order to  enable the countries involved to draw up new schedules for the  Mercosur commercial liberalization and special lists.""    In case any doubt should remain, they continue: ""We also  propose the date of 30 June 1994 for determining the common  foreign tariff and new guidelines for sectorial agreements.""    The following are among the urgent measures requested by the  manufacturers' association:    1) temporary suspension of the commercial liberalization  schedule, meaning that the deadline of the end of December would  be removed;    2) temporary suspension of the reduction in the list of  exceptions so that the 20 percent set for the end of this year  would not take effect;    3) modification of the Las Lenas schedule to permit a fairer  and more appropriate drafting of the common foreign tariff; and    4) a modification of current guidelines for sectorial  agreements.    The manufacturers' association issued its strong demand in  order to mediate the internal dispute raging in the government  over Argentina's position vis-a-vis Brazil.    The Foreign Ministry intends to implement the agreement to  the letter. Such is the gist of the position taken by Minister  Guido Di Tella and Secretary Hector Gambarotta. In contrast, the  Ministry of Economy is more sympathetic to problems caused by  the invasion of imports because it throws the convertibility  plan off balance.    In the letter, which is signed by top-ranking officials  Jorge  Blanco Villegas and Eduardo Faena, the Industrial Union paints a  dark picture of the effects which integration will have on  production if the government fails to take protective measures.    Those effects include the following:    Brazil's imports are replacing efficiently made local  products.    Small and medium-size industries have curtailed their  productive capacity because of the wave of imports.    Other manufacturing sectors have postponed and abandoned  reconversion programs because of the commercial advantages of  complementing sales with the same products imported from Brazil.    Tempted by temporary marketing advantages, some industrial  sectors are totally replacing their production with imports,  maintaining their share of the market and profits while gaining  the added advantage of simplifying business.    All these difficulties stem from the unequal process of  bilateral trade. Manufactured goods make up 90 percent of all  purchases from Brazil. Argentina's exports of manufactured  products comprise only about half (47 percent) of all goods sold  and include agricultural products.    The UIA therefore emphasizes that the problems and ill  effects suffered by many industrial sectors will be complicated  as of 1 January and become even worse if no changes are made by  the beginning of 1995.    The manufacturers argue that there is little time left and  that a decision is urgent. They do not want to condemn Argentina  to the role of supplying fuel and grain.     "

The ministry of finance has given banks a greater role in bond markets, while existing securities houses will be allowed to establish trust banking subsidiaries and be given more freedom in foreign exchange dealings. IBJ Securities is capitalised at Y25bn (Dollars 232m) and will have an initial staff of 138, while LTCB Securities is capitalised at Y20bn and will have a staff of 85. Norinchukin Securities has a capital of Y15bn and 42 employees. The banks had prepared several months ago for the establishment of the securities subsidiaries, but were awaiting approval from the finance ministry, which still has great influence over the entry of companies into new markets. The ministry is expected to review deregulation early next year and consider giving permission to a broader range of banks to open subsidiaries. The ministry has also indicated that, after two or three years, banks may be allowed to deal in stocks, although that is opposed by brokers. The new securities subsidiaries are expected to begin trading later this month, and are likely to concentrate on winning new business in the underwriting of straight bonds, increasingly popular among Japanese companies seeking to diversify their sources of funds.

The tour began  with a visit to the Qatari Steel Company, a steel plant that  utilizes more than 100 workers and produced more than 7 million  tons of steel in 1993.    A management delegation representing this steel company  visited Cuba recently and expressed its interest in establishing  cooperation in this field with the Cuban Government. The Cuban  foreign minister reiterated to the Qatari company Cuba's  willingness to encourage an exchange of expertise in this field  in which the island has a considerable infrastructure.    Robaina and the delegation accompanying him also visited the  Qatari Fertilizer Company, which was founded in 1969 and is  considered the largest ammonium manufacturing company in the  Middle East. This Monday, the Cuban foreign minister will be  received by Amir Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the Qatari chief  of state, and will also meet with the ministers of foreign  relations, health, and finance.    In addition, tomorrow Robaina will officially inaugurate the  new Cuban Embassy in Doha, which will be in charge of relations  with Oman and other Gulf emirates with which Cuba recently  established diplomatic relations. Relations between Havana and  Doha received significant encouragement during the last few  months as a result of the visit of Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad  Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabir Al Thani to Cuba.

The battery reportedly  suffered no loss of performance even after 200 repeated charging  and discharging operations.    Until now, solid electrolyte batteries have demonstrated  poor  ion conductivity and weak current output at room temperature.  The solid electrolyte battery which GIRI has developed resolves  these problems by employing a solid electrolyte called  tetramethyl-ammoniumhydroxide pentahydrate which is known to  have good hydrogen ion conductivity.    The tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate battery  maintains its hydrogen ion conduction properties even when  melted and recooled. When this material is used as the  electrolyte, the battery uses nickel hydroxide for the positive  electrode and a hydrogen-occluded alloy for the negative  electrode. When the hydrate is melted and enclosed, the gap  between electrolyte particles, and the electrical resistance  between the electrolyte and electrodes, decreases. As a result,  a high current density of 10 milliamps per square centimeter is  obtained.    The solid electrolyte battery suffered no loss in  performance  even after being subjected to repeated charging and discharging  up to 200 times between temperatures of 0C to 40C.  When the battery was left to stand for one day after being  charged, however, electrical output dropped and it could not be  used at temperatures greater than 40C, so GIRI says it  plans to try and resolve this problem in the future.

The group said abnormal losses of ADollars 10.6m mainly comprised a restatement of future income tax benefits in anticipation of a proposed reduction in the rate of corporate taxation from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. The board said the lack of sales growth reflected the lack of any worthwhile recovery in the Australian economy. The profit improvement followed higher productivity, lower costs, and the closure of lossmaking businesses. The closures included an ephedrine plant in Newcastle, an advanced ceramics factory at Rockingham in Western Australia and plants at Rhodes, NSW, all of which had been making losses. ICI said prices for its chlor-alkali and sodium cyanide products remained at historically low levels because of world over-supply. Plastics prices also remained low and dumping continued to be 'a significant problem'. The directors said the full-year result would 'satisfactorily exceed' last year unless trading conditions worsened, but 'significant improvement depends mainly on recovery in the Australian economy and international petrochemical prices'. The directors declared an interim dividend of 7 cents a share, up 2 cents. The board said the increase reflected the directors' intention to increase the interim dividend as a proportion of the total dividend.   Companies:-  ICI Australia.   Countries:-  AUZ  Australia.

0," FR940725-0-00128   FR940725-0-00019        While OSHA supports the need for training requirements, OSHA agrees with the position of the majority of commenters that the competent person criteria contained in 1915.7 achieve the same result, that is, a highly trained individual who has knowledge of the unique aspects of shipyard operations and the ability to carry out and perform the required atmospheric tests. The criterion in paragraph (c) of 1915.7 requires the shipyard competent person to have the skill and knowledge necessary to perform atmospheric testing. Because each shipyard is unique, how much training a shipyard competent person must have and how often it must be repeated is left to the employer who is in the best position to determine what skills and knowledge must be reinforced and what resource information needs to be presented. As such, OSHA is of the opinion that by continuing the previous competent person criteria, employers will ensure that the necessary training will continue to be provided to shipyard employers who are so designated as competent persons. Furthermore, OSHA believes that this performance-oriented approach will allow the most flexibility in ensuring the availability of competent person services and in ensuring that the unique conditions in each shipyard can be addressed.   Paragraph (c)(1) is the same as previous paragraph (b)(1) except that the competent person is now required to be able to understand and carry out the written or oral instructions left by the Certified Industrial Hygienist as well as the Marine Chemist and the Coast Guard Authorized Person. Certificates issued by the Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist, or Coast Guard authorized person are written instructions. OSHA had proposed to separate the requirements to understand certificates and to carry out verbal instructions left by the Marine Chemist or Certified Industrial Hygienist or Coast Guard authorized person but the Agency has concluded that the requirements are sufficiently interrelated that they can continue to be listed together in paragraph (c)(1).   Paragraph (c)(2) continues the requirement of previous paragraph (b)(3) that competent persons have a knowledge of Subparts B, C, D, and H of part 1915. OSHA did not propose to change this requirement, and has made only an editorial change in order to improve clarity.   Paragraph (c)(3) is the same as old paragraph (b)(4), requiring that competent persons have a familiarity with the structure and knowledge of the location and designation of spaces on the types of vessels on which repair work is done. OSHA did not propose to change this requirement but in the final rule reflects OSHA's decision to expand the scope of Subpart B to cover all phases of shipyard employment.   In paragraph (c)(4), OSHA continues to require competent persons to have the ability to use and interpret the readings of oxygen indicators, combustible gas indicators, and carbon dioxide indicators, but consistent with the proposal, the Agency has added a requirement that the competent person be able to calibrate the testing equipment and that the equipment not be limited to these monitors.   The proposed language in paragraph (b)(3) was performance-oriented in that it did not limit the testing equipment to the types recognized specifically in paragraph (b)(2) of the previous rule. As new technologies develop and new chemical hazards are encountered in the shipyard working environment, it becomes necessary for competent persons to use new types of environmental monitors and detectors. Skill in the use of this new equipment is necessary for competent persons to be able to identify sources of hazardous exposures in shipyard employment. In addition, OSHA believes that in order for the competent person to have the ability to read and interpret the readings of any type of chemical indicator that may be needed to test atmospheres in the shipyard, a competent person must be familiar enough with the instrumentation to capably calibrate it.   In paragraph (c)(5), OSHA continues the requirement contained in the first portion of paragraph (b)(5) in the previous rule. Paragraph (b)(5) of the previous rule contains two requirements and OSHA has decided to divide the previous rule into two separate requirements in the final rule: Paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(7). Paragraph (c)(5) requires that competent persons must have the capability to perform the tests and inspections required by Subparts B, C, D, and H of part 1915. The requirement in the final rule is consistent with the language proposed in paragraph (b)(6) of the proposal. There were no comments objecting to this change and OSHA considers it to be editorial.   In paragraph (c)(6) OSHA is adding a new requirement to the final rule that coincides with shipyard industry practice. Paragraph (c)(6) requires competent persons to have the ability to evaluate spaces after a test to determine the need for further testing by Marine Chemists, Certified Industrial Hygienists, or by the U.S. Coast Guard authorized persons. OSHA has added this new language to make it clear that there may be atmospheric conditions present in the shipyard that can not be evaluated effectively by a person trained only to the competent person level and that more highly trained individuals may be needed to accurately evaluate an atmosphere. In such cases, OSHA believes this new language would make it clear that an individual such as a Marine Chemist, a Certified Industrial Hygienist, or a Coast Guard authorized person must be called for assistance.

Copley, which last year earned Dollars 12.3m after taxes on sales of Dollars 52m, is an important opening for the bidder's Hoechst Roussel Pharmaceutical Industries subsidiary, which last year reported sales of Dollars 600m in the US and claimed a 1.1 per cent market share. The share of generics - out-of-patent products - in the US prescription drugs market is expected to grow 14 per cent a year until the end of the century, according to Hoechst. It based its forecast on planned US health reforms, aimed at improving treatment for 36m Americans not covered by health insurance, partly by increased use of cheaper generic drugs. The move is also a further step in restructuring at Hoechst, which suffered a 31 per cent decline in profits in the first half of this year. At the end of May the group said it was to sell a majority stake in its viscose and acrylic fibres operations to Courtaulds of the UK. If the deal is concluded, Copley will take over the manufacture and distribution of Hoechst Roussel products as their patents expire, the German group said. Hoechst, which has no generics business in Germany, said the first drug affected would be a treatment for diabetes.   Companies:-  Hoechst.     Copley Pharmaceuticals Inc.

""Under the industrial policy, until the end of 1995, no  projects domestic or foreign involving the making of whole cars  will be approved,"" while restrictions on imports will continue,  the vice minister of the State Planning Commission, Ye Qing,  told reporters.    Foreign companies will instead be encouraged to invest in  factories producing components and spare parts to promote the  backward sector's technological upgrading, Ye quoted the  Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry, issued by the  State Council, as stipulating.    ""We welcome extensive cooperation with foreign partners in  the sphere of component parts,"" the official said, revealing  that any companies involved in successful projects in this  sphere would be given priority when China freed up restrictions  on assembly plants after 1996.    The extent of such liberalisation would depend on China's  economic development and the market demand for family cars at  that time, he said, defending the moves by saying the domestic  industry remained in its ""infant stage"" despite 30 years of  development.    The new policy also outlines moves to rationalise and  upgrade  technological levels in the sector, while encouraging  localisation of component purchasing by offering preferential  treatment to factories buying more than 60 percent of their  parts domestically within three years, Ye said.    Rationalisation is to focus on restructuring the country's  120 scattered, small-scale car plants into bigger groups  producing better quality vehicles, of which most are to be  family cars, he said.    The country's 1.18 billion people now own only 8.3 million  cars, with family vehicles accounting for only small proportion  of China's auto output of 1.18 million units last year.    ""By 1996, we will satisfy 90 percent of the domestic market  demand and over half of auto output will be cars,"" he said.    By 2000, basic restructuring of plants into ""three big and  three small"" conglomerates would be complete, with the three  major groups ""accounting for the majority of sales on China's  domestic market,"" he said.    Ye said the three groups -- which reports say are to produce  five million cars by 2000 -- would be centred around plants in  northeastern Changchun, Shanghai and central Wuhan that have  joint ventures with Germany's Volkswagen-Audi, Volkswagen and  France's Citroen respectively.    Although he did not explain how the restructuring would  affect other existing foreign-funded car assembly projects in  China, foreign carmakers here played down the implications of  the policy paper.    Most major international players are already manufacturing  cars here, they said, adding they were now stepping up  involvement in projects making components and establishing links  with key members of the ""big three"" to ensure their position in  China after 1996.    Of greater concern to foreign manufacturers are the  continuing restrictions on imports. Foreign cars now face  import tariffs of 150 percent.    The Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry was the  first of a series of specific policy statement due to be issued  under the Framework of National Industrial Policy for the 1990s,  also released by the State Council recently.    Other policy papers are to include such sectors as  transportation, telecommunications, construction, electronics  and machinery, petrochemical, foreign trade, foreign investment  and technology, Ye said.

The log-jam has been responsible for a dramatic slowdown this year of foreign investment in India. The fund manager, Martin Currie, is to raise an additional Dollars 150m through an issue of convertible preference shares in the Indian Opportunities Fund. The IOF, managed jointly by Martin Currie and Indian merchant bank Indbank, raised Dollars 100m in an initial placing of ordinary shares last July. A further tranche planned for earlier this year had to be postponed after difficulty arose at custodial banks in India. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, the leading custodial bank in India, which acts as Martin Currie's custodian, told its customers it was temporarily unable to handle any further increase in foreign investments in India. Custodial banks hold share certificates for safe keeping, collect dividends and follow instructions to pass shares to new owners when they are sold. In India each share has its own certificate and the volume of paper this creates has raised serious administrative burdens for large, active institutional investors. Martin Currie has struck an agreement with Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, which acts as a sub-custodian for several large US banks.

Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, told the Commons in a written answer that, since the start of the second public consultation on Thorp in August, the government had received letters from the Irish Republic and Denmark about the application of the European directive on environmental impact assessments to Thorp. He added that Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands had also written to the UK about Thorp and the environmental impact assessments required under international marine pollution recommendations. Ministers are expected to announce within days whether they will give the go-ahead to the Pounds 2.8bn plant. They have already said that they are 'minded' to grant a licence. British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, has said that the alternative of launching a public inquiry could delay start of operation by months and would undermine its profitability. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said yesterday: 'It would be nonsense for the government to give the plant the nod only for the European Court to rule it illegal later.' Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group which has mounted court challenges to the government's handling of the Thorp decision, said yesterday it believed that full environmental impact assessments should be carried out before a decision was made.

The list of proposed projects includes a project for the  production of heat-formed steel blocks, with a gross investment  (not counting land) of 888.9 million Saudi riyals [R] ($236.3  million), with R822.4 million ($219.6 million) needed for  machinery and assembly, R37.4 million ($10 million) in  pre-production costs, and working capital amounting to R25.1  million ($6.7 million), with a construction period of 30 months.    The project's profitability is estimated at a 22-percent  average private return, 34-percent average private return on  invested capital (for easy loans) and net present value (at an  average 10-percent discount) of R861 million, or $230 million;  an annual return on investment of 30 percent, an operating  margin of 45 percent, annual operating profit of R219 million  ($58.5 million), and annual cash flow of R267.4 million ($71.4  million). One million tons of steel blocks would be produced per  year, on three daily shifts, over 330 days, which is the number  of days of annual operation. Products would be sold in  international markets, especially the Far East, Europe, America,  and Canada, noting that the size of the local market is expected  to reach 3 million tons by the year 2000, with export market  volume to reach 100 million tons by the same year.    Another project will produce 200,000 tons of iron rolls.  These would include finished elongated rolls, reinforced beams,  and light sections, with gross investment (not counting land) of  R353.2 million ($94.3 million), of which R265.7 million ($71  million) is for machinery and assembly, R51.1 million ($4  million) for buildings and civil installations, and R45.9  million ($12.2 million) for pre-production costs.    Working capital is R26.5 million ($7.1 million), with  construction time of 20 months, with project profitability of  22-percent average private return, 26-percent average private  return on invested capital (in case of loan), and net present  value (at an average 10-percent discount) of R285 million ($76.1  million), 25- to 29-percent annual return on investment,  29-percent operating margin, R74.9 million ($20 million) annual  operating profits, and R102.8 million ($27.5 million) in cash  flow.    The project study defined the geographic marketing area as  the Western Province of Saudi Arabia, which represents 95  percent of sales, with 5 percent of sales for export markets on  the basis of an estimate of the Western Province's market volume  of more than 1 million tons per year. The proposed opportunities  also include a project to produce  acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene or ABS products, for the  manufacture of high-quality and specialized products. Production  would be about 30,000 tons per year: 10,000 tons of commercial  products per year and 20,000 tons per year of specialized  commercial products. Gross investments (not counting land)  would be almost R261 million ($69.7 million), of which R222.5  million ($59.4 million) would be for machinery and assembly,  with a working capital of nearly R16.8 million ($4.5 million).  Pre-production costs are R21.7 million ($5.8 million), with a  construction period of 24 months.    The sale price per ton would be R5,868 ($1,567) per  factory-delivered ton. Marketing operations would include the  GCC states, which represent 63 percent of sales, with 37 percent  going to international markets. The volume of the Gulf markets  in this area was an annual 24,000 tons in 1991.    The other 14 projects include a project to produce  high-efficiency dehumidifier units, with a gross investment  (excluding land) of nearly R9.98 million ($2.67 million); a  project for electric engine insulators, with a gross investment  of nearly R1.02 million ($275,000); a project for polystyrene  sheets for packaging and wrapping ""tabak"" [tobacco; as  transliterated] at a cost of almost R2.03 million ($540,000); a  project for the press-method manufacture of stainless steel  products, costing $16.4 million; a project for the manufacture  of steel castings products, with a gross investment cost  (excluding land) of almost R74.1 million ($12.5 million). The  list also includes a project producing plastic pellets for  health use with a gross investment of nearly R28.5 million ($7.6  million); a project to produce a rubber compound for covering  the floors of flatbed trucks, with a gross investment of R21.7  million ($5.8 million); a project producing paper pulp and paper  from palm trees at a total cost of nearly R67.4 million ($18  million); a project to produce synthetic diamonds for industrial  uses, with an investment of R35.23 million ($9.41 million); a  project for reinforced concrete bricks with a gross investment  (excluding land) of 15.3 million ($4.1 million); a project to  conform light aluminum products, with a gross investment of  R11.32 million ($3.02 million); a project to produce flexible  enamel-coated copper wire with a gross investment of nearly R4  million ($1.1 million); and a project to produce products  extracted from used motor oils with a gross investment  (excluding land) of R28.7 million ($7.7 million). The final  project produces complete sets for computer cleaning, with a  gross investment (excluding land) of R2.14 million ($570,000).     "

""The construction of an industrial waste treatment centre  reflects self-reliance in handling its own hazardous and toxic  wastes,"" President Suharto said during the inauguration of the  industrial waste treatment centre in Cileungsi, south of Jakarta.    The waste treatment centre, managed by P.T. [Company  Limited]  Prasada Pamunah Limbah Industry, is jointly owned by the  Bimantara Citra Group, the Waste Management International of  Britain, and the Environmental Impact Management Agency  (Bapedal), a government body.    The president said the construction of the hazardous waste  treatment centre also shows that Indonesia is committed to an  agreement reached during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro,  Brazil in 1992 on environment-oriented development.    He also said that the well-guided management of industrial  waste would make Indonesian products more competitive at the  international market on the grounds that many foreign countries  had issued import regulations and requirements linked to the  conservation of nature.    Attending the ceremony were First Lady Tien Suharto, House  Speaker Sutejo [name and title as published], State Minister for  National Development Planning/Head of the National Development  Planning Board Ginanjar Kartasasmita, and Minister of  Administrative Reforms T.B. Silalahi.    Earlier, State Minister of Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmaja  reported to the president that as many as 23 companies handed  over 43 kinds of wastes to the Waste Treatment Centre (PPLI)  which has the capacity to process some 88,000 tons of waste.

Toyota sent two executives to China on Sunday for talks with  Tianjin Automobile Industrial Corp., the officials said.    The two executives are Akira Takahashi, senior managing  director for production technology, and Akira Yokoi, managing  director for external affairs.    During their visit until Thursday, they will hold talks with  Tianjin officials over the possibility of forming a joint  venture, they said.    Moreover, the two Toyota officials will obtain information  on  China's policy on the participation of foreign capital in new  passenger car manufacturing operations expected to be introduced  in 1996.    Toyota's car production in China, if realized, is expected  to  encourage other Japanese and foreign automakers, industry  analysts said.    Already, Ford Motor Co. of the United States and Mitsubishi  Motors Corp. of Japan have declared their intent to move into  the Chinese market.    Toyota has supplied state-owned Jinbei (Gold Cup) automotive  in Shenyang with commercial-vehicle technology.    But it believes Tianjin Automobile Industrial would be the  most appropriate production partner among China's eight car  producers, since the company is expected to form the ""core"" of  the Chinese auto industry in the future.    Tianjin has been turning out cars in a tie-up with Daihatsu  Motor Co. of the Toyota group.    Chinese officials say China plans to create six or seven  conglomerates by the year 2000, each capable of churning out  300,000 cars a year. These would be further reshuffled into  three or four giants in the early decades of the next century.     "

Mr Schenck, who said Knoll was to cut its labour costs by 15 per cent, added that his forecast excluded any charges incurred by workforce reductions. He attributed two-thirds of the blame for the slump to the German government's clamp on health service costs. Knoll, which earned DM113m (Dollars 68m) net last year, will also seek economies by reducing spending on research and development by around 10 per cent, in contrast to the usual practice of increasing budgets by a similar proportion. Turnover in the nine months to the end of September had fallen 5 per cent to DM1.48bn despite a 3 per cent increase in foreign sales which accounted for 77 per cent of the total. Domestic turnover had dropped 7 per cent overall, although revenues from drugs affected by a government-imposed price freeze and prescription limits had fallen 14 per cent. Mr Schenck protested that although drugs accounted for only 15 per cent of the statutory health scheme's costs, manufacturers were having to bear 20 per cent of the cuts. Leading German research-based pharmaceuticals makers had suffered falls in sales of between 9 per cent and 27 per cent in the first eight months of the year, he said. Mr Schenck also revealed that Knoll had stopped all research and development work on a genetically-engineered cancer treatment, TNF, which which had not proved 'significantly effective' in clinical trials.

Four institutions in Los Angeles and one each in San Diego and San Francisco  were among the names on a list sent out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,  which regulates banks and insures bank deposits.    The FDIC notice said these ""banks"" apparently were operating illegally and  added: ""Any proposed transactions involving any of the listed entities should  be viewed with extreme caution.""    A federal banking regulator said a bank in the Southwest discovered Thursday  morning that it had lost $36,000 in a scheme involving a fraudulent cashier's  check drawn on one of the institutions, located on Montserrat in the West  Indies. The regulator declined to identify the victimized bank and asked that  his name be withheld.      Few Legitimate Uses    The regulator said the number of entities operating as banks in the United  States without proper authorization or license has increased substantially in  recent months.    Many banks on the FDIC warning list are located in Montserrat, where  authorities have sold more than 200 bank charters in recent months, according  to U.S. regulators. The names on the charters sound official and are often  similar to those of established institutions.    The charters are re-sold at high mark-ups by organized businesses to U.S.  citizens, who then operate them in this country, according to testimony at  congressional hearings conducted in 1985.    Although neither selling nor buying such a charter is illegal, experts told  Congress there are few legitimate uses for these banks and they said many are  used in illegal schemes, including issuing worthless cashier's checks and other  types of financial instruments.    In the case that came to light Thursday, a customer at the Southwestern bank  cashed a $36,000 cashier's check drawn on Lux International Bancorp in  Montserrat. The U.S. bank held the check for several days, assumed that it had  cleared and gave the customer the cash.    By the time the bank discovered that no funds had been received to honor the  check, the customer had disappeared.    For several months, federal law enforcement officials in California and other  states have been investigating similar schemes involving worthless certified  drafts drawn on nonexistent Mexican banks, including two of the 43 entities  cited by the FDIC.    The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington also is  investigating off-shore banks and provided the names that the FDIC issued  Thursday.    James R. Dudine, an enforcement official with the FDIC in Washington, said the  number of successful frauds pulled off using the questionable banks is  relatively small.    ""Most banks are astute enough not to get caught with this sort of stuff. But  there are some real dangers,"" he said.    Most of the U.S. names on the list were not listed with telephone operators.    One institution on the list is Banco Commercial Arabe in Los Angeles. Robert M.  Talcott, an attorney for one of the institution's principals, said it does not  function as a bank, but as a financial services company that arranges loans and  joint ventures. He said the company is in compliance with appropriate  regulations.

Dr. Panya Sonkhom, the Director of the Department of Medical  Sciences of the Ministry of Public Health, said that 116 water  samples had been taken from the waterways which pass by the  various factories in the Maptaphut and Laemchabang Industrial  Estates and flow close to populated areas. The samples had been  taken each month for 14 months [sic] from March 1991 to February  1992. They were analyzed for toxic chemicals which would be  dangerous to the health of the people in these watersheds. The  analysis did not find any PCB's in any of the samples, but lead  was found in 37 of the samples or 31.7 percent, and mercury was  found in 19 of the samples or 16.4 percent.    Dr. Panya said that among the samples in which lead and  mercury were found, there were samples which exceeded the  standard for the maximum level allowed for waste water, namely,  there was one sample with lead over 20 micrograms per deciliter,  and there was one sample with mercury over 0.5 micrograms per  liter. Even though this survey did not find any PCB's, a cancer  causing substance, and found lead and mercury which exceeded the  standards set in only one sample each, nevertheless the  department would continue to check for toxic chemicals in the  environment, and it had requested assistance on a continuing  basis from other units involved to help keep track of  environmental pollution in order to support the development of  the eastern seaboard and to avoid health hazards for the people  in this area in the future.

0,FT933-717 ,"FT933-717 _AN-DI1CRACEFT 930928   FT  28 SEP 93 / 'Nuclear dustbin' charge levelled at Thorp operator      By BRONWEN MADDOX and CHRIS TIGHE   NEARLY 90 per cent of foreign radioactive waste sent for reprocessing at the controversial Thorp plant in Sellafield, Cumbria, could remain in the UK permanently, Greenpeace claimed yesterday. The pressure group, which does not want the Pounds 2.8bn plant to be given a licence to start operation, argues that Sellafield will become a 'nuclear dustbin' for foreign radioactive waste if Thorp is given the go-ahead. The claims are contained in a 40-page report commissioned by Greenpeace from Large  Associates, London-based consultants, and published today. The report says that British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, gave evidence to the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee suggesting it has agreed to send back only 11 per cent of foreign waste. The report further claims that BNF wants to send back no more 1 per cent of foreign waste, measured by volume. Under a policy known as 'substitution', BNF plans to send customers more highly radioactive waste in exchange for keeping bulky low and intermediate level waste - saving the customer transport costs. BNF said last night that contracts signed since 1976 allowed it to return all waste produced. Cumbria County Council is expected to back the start-up of Thorp when all 83 councillors meet next Monday, the last day for public consultation on the project. However the working party to the council, whose views are based on independent research commissioned by the council, recommends that start-up should go ahead only if the plant can be shown to meet all safety criteria.

Shanghai has set 12 percent for this year's GNP growth rate  and the total industrial output value will have a growth rate of  over 15 percent at least. In January this year, the industrial  output value totalled RMB 19 billion, 13 percent up over the  same period of last year.    Experts in Shanghai consider the reason for the rise in  industrial production there was that the impact of macro-control  and relevant reform measures adopted by the central government  had eased in Shanghai and the economy there had started to  operate as expected. In addition, achievements in the  utilization of funds, market development and reform of  state-owned enterprises were also part of the reason.    Production and marketing of Shanghai's industry increased at  the same pace from January to April this year. The total  industrial output value from January to April increased by 14.6  percent over the same period of last year and the total sales  value was 15.1 percent up. The ratio of production to sales was  95.74 percent and in April this ratio reached 97.5 percent.    Experts, however, warned that the tasks of curbing inflation  and reducing enterprise losses remained arduous. Shanghai Mayor  Mr. Huang Ju said recently that pushing forward sales was the  principal task. Meanwhile, arrangements for funds, utilization  of foreign capital, and municipal engineering projects should  also be well handled while certain reform measures would be  implemented at the proper time.

0,FT943-3797 ,"FT943-3797 _AN-EILDEAFVFT 940912   FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (12): More anchor at Subic - Industrial estates are reflecting economic revival      By JOSE GALANG   The economic recovery of the past two years has stirred activity in various parts of the country, particularly in the industrial estates being put up to capture investment flows. The most notable is the Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone, which is rising from the former US naval base along Subic Bay on the western fringe of the main island of Luzon. Since its conversion into an industrial estate in November 1992, the Subic zone has signed up 73 companies to set up a range of industrial and commercial operations within the 6,000-hectare facility. Of these, 44 have actually started operations. The Subic estate sits between a deep natural harbour opening up to the South China Sea and a mountain range. These features, industrial planners say, make the facility an ideal anchorage. Having been a jump-off point for American military operations in the region, the zone has an airport, shipping berths and a well-maintained road network, along with fully-operating utilities (power station, telecommunications, water and sewerage systems) and structures that can quickly be converted into warehouses, residential buildings and offices. All these make the area ideal for investors in a hurry. Its location also makes it suitable for ventures aiming at the Asian market. Subic's twin military base, Clark Field, located to its east in the central Luzon province of Pampanga, has also seen increased interest in recent months. Thirty-five companies have formalised deals with the Clark Development Corporation to set up shop in the zone. Clark is initially developing a core area of 4,440ha, of which 1,620ha have been roped off to become an aviation centre and another 1,020ha for industry. The project will be expanded by another 23,600ha to accommodate light and medium industrial and agro-industrial ventures. The aviation complex will include an international airport, to be developed from the facility left behind the US air force that withdrew from the area just before the June 1991 eruption of nearby Mount Pinatubo. Like Subic, the Clark industrial estate offers locaters immediate infrastructure facilities, including a power plant, telecommunications and a water system. Incentives await locaters in Subic and Clark. There is exemption from taxes and duties on all imports of capital goods, machinery, raw materials and finished goods; exemption from local and national taxes except for a final 5 per cent corporate tax on gross income; and tax holidays of four to six years. A highway to link the two industrial zones with metropolitan Manila is near completion, and will reduce travel time within the area. Closer to metropolitan Manila are the privately-run industrial parks that have sprouted in the Calabarzon area, which groups the five provinces surrounding the national capital - Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon. In 1990, the government designated regional industrial centres (RICs) in each of the 12 regional groupings outside metropolitan Manila, leading to the Calabarzon concept. The Calabarzon project aims to create a business corridor south and east of the national capital, to capture the city's overspill population without causing additional poverty and other social problems. The corridor has a combined land area of nearly 16,230 square kilometres, or 5.4 per cent of the whole Philippine land area, and a population of 6.35m. It is already accommodates a range of manufacturing operations set up by big US, Japanese, South Korean and European groups. The area also has an industrial base composed of oil refineries; manufacturing operations in industrial gases, non-alcoholic beverages, paper products, flour and feeds, metal products and other consumer goods; shipbuilding; food processing; and power generation. Among the first industrial estates that are now offered to investors are: Dasmarinas Industrial Estate, Gateway Business Park, GMA Industrial Estate, Cavite Industrial City, Laguna International Industrial Park, Laguna Technopark, Light Industry and Science Park of the Philippines, along with the government-run Cavite Export Processing Zone. Farther out of the capital, the government has identified the following growth centres: The Cagayan-Iligan corridor, in northern Mindanao, which is being developed as a heavy industrial centre, and a major agro-industrial and trade centre in view of its access to hydro-power sources and industrial base. el,3.5 The north-west Luzon quadrangle, said to be a potential financial centre and tourist haven, given its proximity to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Japan. The Cotabato-Davao-Zamboanga crescent, which is being promoted as an agribusiness centre to become a major exporter of fresh and processed food and other products. The Panay-Negros pole, in the central Philippines, now being developed for light and medium manufacturing activities specialising in furniture, jewellery, toys, handicrafts, kitchen and hardware. The Leyte-Samar zone, also in the central Philippines, which is being considered as another heavy industry centre, because of its access to geothermal and hydro-power sources. The west-central Luzon zone and baselands, which may be tapped to specialise in ship and aircraft manufacturing and repair, warehousing and transshipment, defence industries, and other light-to-medium industries.

Together with Han Xikai, deputy secretary of the provincial  party committee; Zhang Ruifeng, vice governor of the provincial  government; and Cui Weilin, vice chairman of the provincial  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference and chairman of the provincial education commission,  Comrade Jiang Chunyun arrived at Shandong Industrial University  at 0830. They first watched the exhibition on the achievements  made during the monthly scientific and technological campaign  organized by the Communist Youth League committee of the  university as well as the achievements made in the first applied  scientific and technological invention contest, and fully  affirmed the achievements. Then, they went to the [words  indistinct] laboratory and heard the introduction of the  situation. At the mess hall of the university, the comrades,  including Jiang Chunyun, tried to understand, in detail, the  situation relating to the varieties of dishes and the prices of  the food. Comrade Jiang Chunyun visited two student dormitories  and the houses of two teachers to understand their living and  housing conditions. After that, at the sports center of the  university, the comrades, including Jiang Chunyun, held a forum  with representatives of teachers and students of the university.    After hearing the reports by the university leaders and the  speeches by some teachers and students, on behalf of the  provincial party committee and the provincial government,  Comrade Jiang Chunyun set forth five requirements for how to  improve the work of the institutions of higher learning.    First, the institutions of higher learning should cultivate  more skilled persons for the development of the socialist market  economy. To suit the demands of the socialist market economy,  universities should cultivate more qualified skilled persons in  a rapid manner so as to satisfy the needs of the socialist  modernization.    Second, institutions of higher learning should bring into  full play the advantages of wisdom and intelligence so as to  make greater contributions to Shandong's economic and social  development. We should positively explore ways for linking  science and technology with the economy, accelerate the  transformation of scientific and technological findings, and  make greater contributions to comprehensively implementing the  strategy of relying on science and education to rejuvenate  Shandong and the provincial strategic goals for economic  development.    Third, the deepening of reform has injected new vitality  into  the higher education. The reform of the higher educational  cause should be conducive to the adherence to the school-running  orientation of socialism, the mobilization of the broad masses  of teaching and administrative staff members' working  enthusiasm, the cultivation of increasingly more skilled  persons, the stability of the campus order, and the  self-development of institutions of higher learning. According  to the requirements of the socialist market economy, we should  further readjust the structure of specialized courses, optimize  teaching contents and teaching methods, pay attention to the  students' quality and ability, and make the students better suit  the social demands.    Fourth, we should show concern for the working, studying,  and  living conditions of the teachers, the students, and the  administrative staff members; and realistically help solve their  practical difficulties and problems. The party committees and  governments at various levels and relevant departments should  pay attention to helping schools eliminate difficulties and do  more concrete and good deeds for the teachers and students.  Appropriate jobs should be arranged for the students graduated  this year so that they will bring their talents into full play.  The school should issue certificates of graduation to the  students who are not covered in the recruitment quotas so long  as they pass the examinations. The province will allocate  special funds to subside the small number of the students with  living difficulties due to the price hikes.    Fifth, we should adopt realistic and effective measures to  maintain the stability of institutions of higher learning. The  departments concerned and all social fronts should proceed from  the overall situation of social stability, carry out the system  of responsibility for stability, and ensure the university  should have a stable social environment. We should guide the  broad masses of teachers, students, and administrative staff  members to take the overall situation into consideration,  observe discipline, and concentrate energy on their teaching and  studying. The broad masses of teachers and students should  consciously resist the influence of bourgeois liberation and  corrosive ideas; firmly foster accurate ideals, convictions,  outlook on life, and outlook on value; and be persons of the new  generation with ideals, morality, education, and a sense of  discipline.    Jiang Chunyun finally urged that the broad masses of  teachers  and students of the university should work and study hard; build  the university into a center especially training senior  engineers and technicians, a high-tech research center, and a  new high-tech development center; and make greater contributions  to Shandong's economic development.

In 1993, the company posted profits of FFr405m. It attributed the increase to improved trading conditions in its main markets and a 30 per cent reduction in financial charges. Turnover rose 3.6 per cent to FFr27.69bn, although the increase was much stronger in the company's industrial activities. Operating profits climbed to FFr1.48bn from FFr1.34bn. According to Schneider, the first six months brought a strong contribution from its US activities. However, industrial operations in Canada incurred losses. In Europe, economic conditions improved, although the French market remained mediocre and the company incurred exceptional costs from the merger of its Merlin Guerin and Telemecanique operations. Schneider's Spie Batignoles division, which includes its construction and property activities, continued to suffer losses, although the deficit was reduced during the first half, to FFr59m from FFr70m. The company said the operating environment remained relatively weak, but that charges from the division would be lower for the full year than in 1993. Financial charges were reduced to FFr630m from FFr906m during the first half. Schneider said the reduction reflected a lower debt burden, resulting from a capital increase last year and the sale of non-strategic assets. It said it expected to finalise shortly the creation of a joint company which pooled its robotic operations with those of AEG of Germany.   Companies:-  Schneider.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

Adelaide Steamship, formerly the group's flagship, announced a net loss of ADollars 61m (USDollars 43.5m) for the six months to the end of December, compared with a loss of ADollars 69m for the comparable period of the previous year. The company said earnings before interest and tax rose 23 per cent to ADollars 241m, while financing costs fell 13 per cent to ADollars 290m. However, the deficiency in shareholders' funds grew by 13 per cent to ADollars 620m. Mr George Haines, managing director, said the result included an abnormal loss of ADollars 107.8m, mostly related to provisions against the value of the group's UK property portfolio, held through Markheath, a 61 per cent subsidiary. 'Adsteam directors have deemed it prudent to make a one-off full provision against the group's Markheath involvement,' Mr Haines said. Mark-heath's discussions with its banks were 'proceeding constructively'. Other companies in the group also fared badly. David Jones, the up-market retailer, lost a net ADollars 59m, compared with ADollars 53m, and Tooth and Co, the industrial group, lost a net ADollars 58m, compared with ADollars 40.5m. The bright spot was Industrial Equity (IEL), owned by Adelaide Steamship, David Jones and Tooth, which re-ported an improvement in net profit to ADollars 79m from ADollars 27m. IEL said the improvement would have been larger but for the ADollars 19m cost of deferring the flotation of its Woolworths supermarket subsidiary, and ADollars 6.4m in other abnormal charges.

It is being published to provide a deeper  understanding of the role of AIST laboratories.    This is the 32nd annual laboratory research plan published  by  the AIST going back to 1962 and is reported to provide the most  in-depth look at AIST laboratories.    Looking back at the previous year, we noted that many  countries around the world anticipated last year to be a major  turning point. An international accord was reached at a  UN-sponsored conference on the issue of environmental protection  versus economic growth in June in Brussels in which countries  agreed to work with one another under the banner of ""sustainable  development."" Turning an eye toward the domestic front,  meanwhile, we note that a Five-Year Plan was enacted in June to  have the standard of living in Japan match that of the major  powers in the world in terms of building an economy in which  people experience a real sense of being rewarded for their work.  This has been the result of both re-examining the  mass-production, consumer-oriented society that Japan has  created, and, together with that, recognizing the importance of  establishing a foundation of growth built on a harmonious  relationship between the environment and society.    Working on that basis, the MITI AIST has produced a  comprehensive industrial science policy for 1993 that should  contribute to continued growth and popularity of science and  technology in Japan.    In 1993, in particular, we note the opening of the new  National Institute for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research  (NAIR), a new research laboratory that promotes joint research  between government, industry, and academia, between different  scientific disciplines, and between countries. This year also  marks the start of the National Institute of Materials and  Chemical Research (NIMC) and the National Institute of  Bioscience and Human Technology (NIBH), which were both  established to attract researchers in relevant fields of  research to conduct research in the area of substances and  materials and biotechnology-related fields. In addition, many  earlier research projects were reincorporated into the  Industrial Science and Technology Frontier Program (ISTF) and  New Sunshine Project. Besides the radically new RD project  system, the agency has been formulating various policies to form  a three-pillar support structure to promote cooperative  international research.    The agency has also been actively working to increase  funding  of the Japan Key Technology Center that was founded to promote  development of private-sector technologies, and has initiated  joint private-sector research projects in regional areas such as  the local Large-Scale Project centered around public examination  and technology centers that promotes technologies with a local  character to them, and on standard basic research aimed at  raising the standard of living in Japan to that of other  advanced countries.    The RD being done in science and technology in Japan  has to  be further consolidated in the future, not merely to sustain  economic growth in Japan but also to sustain the growth of the  international economy as a whole, and in that context, AIST  research laboratories are being counted on to play a major role  to make this happen. The great expectations being placed in AIST  research laboratories creates complex circumstances for them to  operate in, but we believe that it is still possible to energize  research activities and produce even more outstanding results.

Total industrial production output value at  the township level and above was 3.0478 billion yuan, an  increase of 7.6 percent over the same period last year. At  present, industrial development trends in our province have the  following features:    1. Heavy industry still occupies an important position in  the overall industrial production, and in particular, the  production of non-ferrous metals smelting industry and the iron  smelting industry have increased further. In April, the total  production output value of heavy industry reached 2.167 billion  yuan, 11.7 percent more than that of the same period last year.  Heavy industry's sales volume was 2.021 billion yuan, up 6  percent over the corresponding period last year. Its production  and marketing rate was 93.2 percent.    2. The production of summer beverages, like beer and  alcohol-free soft drinks, has developed more rapidly. The  production of energy products also has maintained a better  momentum. In April, generated energy was 1.37 billion kwh, an  increase of 36.3 over the same period last year. Production  output of raw coal was 4.09 million tons, 17.4 percent more than  that of the same period last year. Production output of natural  gas was 26.36 million cubic meter, up 400 percent over the  corresponding period last year.    3. Production costs have increased by a wide margin, and the  deficit situation remains serious. According to the results of  investigations made in 201 large and medium-sized industrial  enterprises, there were 123 deficit-making enterprises,  accounting for 61 percent of the total. The newly increased  deficits occurred mainly in the machinery, chemical, and light  industrial sectors. Therefore, they face a very strenuous task  of turning from deficits to profits.     "

Under the policies, China will, through industrial  restructuring, pinpoint the development of agriculture,  infrastructure and basic industries, electronics and machinery,  petroleum and petro-chemicals, trade, as well as the auto and  building industries, said Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State  Planning Commission, at a press conference.    Ye said that the ""framework of national industrial policy in  the 1990s (FNIP)"", worked out by the State Council, China's  highest governing body, laid down important policies on the  direction and targets of the country's structural adjustment in  the 1990s.    He said China encourages direct foreign investment in  infrastructure and basic industries. Investors in the transport  sector are expected to be given first priority in developing  real estate along the facilities they build.    To promote trigger industries, China will increase input  into  technological advancement in electronics and machinery, oil and  petro-chemicals, automobile and building industries. Those  sectors will also enjoy priority in issuing bonds and shares, Ye  said.    China will also readjust import tariffs in accordance with  the industrial policies to boost foreign trade, he said.    Under the just-issued policies, the vice-minister said,  China  will also rationalize the industrial organization, promote  technological upgrading, adjust economic location, continue to  develop service sectors, and accelerate the growth of hi-tech  industries.    According to Ye, the State Council will, in the near future,  spell out specific policies for such infrastucture and key  industries as transport, telecommunications, construction,  electronics and machinery, petro-chemical industry, foreign  trade, foreign investment and technology, so as to speed up  development of those sectors.

The company's process engineering subsidiary yesterday signed an exclusive memorandum of understanding with Chinese Offshore Industrial Corporation, a state-owned shipbuilding group. The two companies are finalising joint-venture terms. The agreement covers construction of on-shore petrochemical plants as well as off-shore oil and gas production facilities for use in China. The deal will also enable the joint venture to build advanced deep-water floating production vessels in China for sale worldwide. Amec will contribute half the venture's costs. In return for enhancing its strategic position in the Chinese market, Amec will transfer technology for management of projects and engineering design. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said: 'Although technology transfer was an issue, it was clear that many key skills and abilities already exist in our partner's organisation.' The venture will develop a joint facility at Huang Pu shipyard in Guangzhou province in southern China, capable of building modules of up to 5,000 tonnes each. COIC also has the ability to build large floating production platforms at a 300,000-tonne dry dock in north-east China. Amec is already building accommodation modules in partnership with COIC for Phillips Petroleum platforms in the South China Sea. Amec is one of Britain's biggest manufacturers and service providers for the UK oil and gas industries. Demand for North Sea off-shore platforms for has fallen sharply in the past 18 months. Amec has been seeking to use its technology to expand abroad.   Companies:-  Amec.     Chinese Offshore Industrial Corp.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     CNZ  China, Asia.

Marco Antonio Slim Domit, director of the leading financial  group Segumex-Inbursa, has said the implementation of NAFTA will  result in growth in the assembly plant industry. He said ""30  new industries have already opened this year, and it is expected  140 other plants will open before the end of the year."" This  represents a 19.2-percent increase over 1993.    Industrial specialist John Christman has reported the  industry ""could be worth approximately $28.5 billion"" by  December. The big winners, he added, ""will be the auto  industry, textiles, and garments,"" the exports of which are  expected to hit $20 billion by 1999. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO  in Spanish 26 April 94 p 22)    Carlos Eduardo Represas, president of the Private Sector  Economic Studies Center, has said economic growth and investment  projects for 1994 have already been affected by interest rate  increases and pressure on exchange rates. Following his  participation in a seminar entitled Mexican Industrial Policy,  he proposed the government devise a number of economic, social,  and political measures aimed at restoring confidence. Represas  denied, however, the current conditions forecast a drastic drop  in the currency exchange rate. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in  Spanish 27 April 94 pp 1, 31)    Herminio Blanco, under secretary for international trade  negotiations of the Commerce and Industrial Development  Secretariat, Secofi, has reported Mexican exports to the United  States increased 23 percent during the first quarter of 1994.  This, he said, ""is a result of NAFTA."" The assembly industry,  for its part, increased exports by 28 percent during the same  period. Blanco said Mexico deems workers' rights and the  environment to be very important issues, but ""we will never  accept their being used for the imposition of measures for  commercial protectionism."" (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish  27 April 94 p 22)    Secofi Secretary Jaime Serra Puche has said foreign  investments reached $5.22 billion during the first quarter of  1994, 89 percent higher than the same period in 1993. During an  impromptu news conference following his participation at the  seminar on Mexican Industrial Policy, he said oil exports were  20 percent higher in March and could reach 25 percent under  NAFTA. He reported, however, foreign investment in general  dropped approximately 50 percent in March with regard to January  1994. While U.S. imports from other countries rose 11 percent,  imports from Mexico grew twice as much. Serra Puche concluded  generally speaking, ""implementation of NAFTA and lower import  tariffs have produced encouraging results for the country.""  (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 7)    Imports of computer technology increased 28 percent,  following the implementation of NAFTA and the lifting of trade  tariffs. Mexican computer and software exports, meanwhile, are  relatively low in comparison to imports. Industrial leader  Antonio Medina Mora said the industry will require more  financial support to reach its goals. Projections for 1995,  under the present free trade market conditions, show $2 billion  in sales. Software is expected to grow by 28 percent, services  by 18.9 percent, and hardware by 16.6 percent. (Mexico City EL  FINANCIERO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 26)    The financial group Asemex-Banpais has stated $4.95 billion  was transferred out of the country during March. He added  international reserves dropped to $24 billion compared to the  $29 billion available in January and February. The main routes  were through the Mexican stock market, with 36.24 percent of the  total, and the currency exchange market, with 34.69 percent.  Banking notes, negotiable documents, and open shares followed.  The group noted, however, that ""even if all economic agents  were to trade in their pesos for dollars, the reserves would  still be sufficient to cover the demand;"" therefore, the  document concludes, ""there is no call for a devaluation of the  peso."" (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 27 April 94 p 17)    The Bank of Mexico has reported loans granted to the  manufacturing sector dropped 3.5 percent during the first month  of the year. The bank granted loans totaling 60.43 billion  pesos in December 1993. That amount dropped to 58.17 billion  pesos in January 1994; this, the report states, affected other  areas such as insurance, accounting services, rentals, and other  related activities. Credit requests from these fields dropped  proportionally. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 27 April 94 p  19)    The government and private sector's firm control over labor  unions has prevented Mexican workers from freely and  democratically organizing unions, while 5 to 6 million people  are unemployed, and approximately 12 million have part-time  jobs. This information was disclosed by the Authentic Labor  Front, FAT, and corroborated by the Confederation of Mexican  Workers (CTM). Furthermore, according to FAT, workers' buying  power has deteriorated, and their meager participation in  nongovernment unions proves there is a lack of freedom in that  respect. (Paris AFP in Spanish 0943 GMT 28 April 94)    The National Chamber of Electrical Appliance Manufacturers  [Caname] has disclosed the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE)  has substantially reduced its local acquisitions to control its  budget and reduce its foreign loans, which dropped from 2.8  billion new pesos in 1991 to 1.4 billion pesos in 1992 and 1.2  billion pesos in 1993. Caname says that due to the problems  that emerged with the implementation of NAFTA early this year,  the CFE's local purchases totaled 132 million pesos, which is an  insignificant figure. Meanwhile, CFE imports in 1993 totaled  453 million pesos, down from 665 million pesos in 1992. (Mexico  City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 April 94 p 32)    The Mexican Telephone System (Telmex) has reported the loss  of 718.75 million pesos during the first quarter of 1994 due to  fluctuations in the exchange rate and a substantial increase in  interest rates in the United States over the past few months.  In its quarterly report, the company has disclosed its net  profits during the same period amounted to 1.850 billion pesos  (approximately $560 million), 14.3 percent less than it earned  in 1993. An EL FINANCIERO study indicates investors recovered  some of their confidence, but the uncertainty of the past few  months still had an effect; nevertheless, Telmex sales, up until  March, totaled 6.630 billion pesos (approximately $2.09  billion), 13 percent more than during the same period in 1993.  (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 April 94 p 10)    A report by the Indosuez Bank presents Telmex as the most  attractive telecommunications company on the Latin American  market. Indosuez says compared to other Latin American telephone  companies in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Peru, Telmex  offers the best value. The comparison was based on the  macroeconomic conditions of each country, the possibilities for  growth, corporate efficiency, debt, and the flow of funds. The  purchase of Telmex shares was strongly recommended in the report  because the company is rapidly replacing its old lines with  digital equipment. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28  April 94 p 10)    In an immediate response to the reduction of treasury bond  interest rates, the Mexican stock market closed with an increase  for the second consecutive day, thus accumulating a two-day  advance of 6.38 percent. On 27 April, the index of prices and  quotations increased 48.65 points, 2.13 percent, closing at  2,332 points and 78 trading units. Financial analysts have said  the stock market is reacting favorably to the agreements signed  by the economic secretaries and ministers of Mexico, Canada, and  the United States to strengthen the currency. (Mexico City  Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 28 April)    The Mexican Network of Action In Response to Free Trade has  said the first quarter of NAFTA negatively affected Mexico. The  agricultural and forestal sectors suffered adverse economic  effects, the country's trade deficit increased by 20 percent,  and there was an unexpected increase in imports of consumer  goods. The group adds complaints of labor rights violations  were also filed at the NAFTA Labor Commission based in Dallas.  Network representative Bertha Lujan says her organization will  demand the renegotiation of NAFTA. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in  Spanish 29 April 94 p 59)    Today during a meeting with the leaders of small- and  medium-sized businesses in Mexico City, Commerce and Industrial  Development Secretary Jaime Serra Puche said Mexico's exports to  the United States increased 22 percent during the first two  months of 1994. He explained this is due to NAFTA and is very  encouraging for Mexico. Serra Puche said that during the first  quarter of 1994, foreign investment in Mexico amounted to $5.2  billion, which will increase as Mexico increases its products on  foreign markets. He added Mexico intends to strengthen trade  with the Central American nations. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in  Spanish 29 April 94 p 57)    A report by the Presidency of the republic indicates that  thanks to NAFTA, nonoil exports increased during the first  quarter of 1994, achieving a growth rate of 23.9 percent.  Imports increased overall by 19.7 percent, surpassing overall  exports, which increased by 17.5 percent. The report indicates  the effect of releasing tariffs was reflected in the growth of  bilateral trade with the United States, which increased 22.4  percent, and trade with Canada, which increased 48.5 percent.  Meanwhile, nonoil agricultural exports in January and February  surpassed those of the same period in 1993 by $1.4 billion.  (Mexico city EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 29 April 1994 p 24)     "

The volume of Japan's industrial waste dumped at sea  accounts  for two-thirds of the world's total.    The government reviewed its dumping in light of the revision  in the convention on the prevention of marine pollution by  dumping of wastes and other matters. Even so, it decided to  endorse dumping of about 80 percent of industrial waste  currently dumped at sea, the sources said.    The material includes construction waste, sewage sludge and  fluid from the manufacture of clear distilled liquor, they said.    The government judged that most industrial wastes dumped in  the ocean corresponds to materials still permitted by the  revision, the sources said.    The convention was revised at a signatory nations' meeting  in  November. Exceptions to the ban include materials such as  dredged waste, sewage sludge, uncontaminated inert geological  materials and uncontaminated organic materials of natural origin.    The revision leaves each country to judge what will  correspond to the exceptions.    Currently, Japan annually dumps about 4.4 million tons of  industrial waste, including 2.8 million tons of sludge and 1.3  tons of waste fluid, they said.    The government decided to ban dumping of waste fluid from  photo processing and some sludge from sewage and construction,  but the volume of the industrial wastes to be reduced will be  not more than 900,000 tons, or 20 percent of current volume,  they said.    The sources said the decision is a provisional measure  because the convention may ban all industrial waste dumping  without exception after 1996.     "
0,FT944-6860 ,"FT944-6860 _AN-EK1C5ABXFT 941128   FT  28 NOV 94 / Malaysia ban 'cost power contract'      By CHRIS TIGHE   Malaysia's ban earlier this year on placing government contracts with UK companies has cost Parsons Power Generation Systems a contract worth more than Pounds 100m, says the company's parent, Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group. The contract, for two 500MW steam turbine generators for the new Port Klang power station, would have helped Parsons overcome the orders gap it faces. Negotiations with the Malaysian authorities were halted when the trade ban was imposed in February, after the Sunday Times newspaper alleged bribes had been offered to senior Malaysian politicians by a UK company. The ban gave Parsons' US rival, General Electric, an opportunity, and it was announced last week that it had won the contract. Mr Richard Maudslay, managing director of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, said: 'We were very close to winning it. These things happen. You have to get on with it. It's unfortunate but we will still continue to be active in the Malaysian market.' He said that previously the Gulf war halted a contract with the Iraqis. The loss of the Port Klang prospect reduces Parsons' chances of clinching new orders soon enough to avoid further job cuts. Manufacturing work on existing export contracts finishes next summer. Its main Newcastle upon Tyne base employs 2,100 people, but 400 jobs are going over the next month and 200 temporary jobs are to be phased out. Hopes of avoiding further redundancies hinge on winning an order from Singapore for two 600MW steam turbine generators for the Tuas power station early next year, and reaching agreements on at least one of three Indian power station projects.

This decision was reached at a routine  conference of the council of CIS industrial enterprise chief  designers.    ""Some 5,000 plants in six of the biggest Commonwealth  countries will be able to pass their customers information on  the parameters, cost, and terms for selling their output, and to  obtain similar information on other producers' materials and  products,"" Leonid Gancharik, chairman of the chief designers'  council and general director of the ""Tsentrsistem"" Science and  Production Association in Minsk, said. ""Subscription to the  service will make it possible to obtain regular thematic  information without any additional request being made, along  with an analysis of the market situation regarding availability  of goods and their price. Above all, shipments of output under  intergovernmental agreements will be placed under operational  control.""    The creation of this global information network is very  important today. Simply reducing crosshauls and ""freeing up""  middlemen will have enormous benefits -- accurate knowledge of  the market situation plays a fundamental role in the fate of  enterprises. Similar information structures have long been in  operation in many industrially developed countries.    Any enterprise with ordinary telegraphic communications, a  phone line with a modem, or a fax can link up with the system.  These information ""nerves"" will join up at republic and  regional centers. For instance, there will be 12 of them in  Russia, linked by high-speed modems. There will be no ""main""  center in the system -- all of them will have absolutely equal  rights and technical capabilities. Nor will any country have  priority in obtaining, processing, and transmitting important  production and economic information.     "

Interviewed at Beijing  Airport, Zhou Guangzhao said that the scientific and  technological circles on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should  further learn from each other's strong points to supplement  their shortcomings in order to develop both sides' science,  technology, and economies.    [Zhou Guangzhau] ""The delegation that visited Taiwan this  time consisted of 25 members, including eight CAS academicians.""    Zhou Guangzhao said: The 25 members of the delegation,  including experts from CAS, relevant universities, the General  Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of  Metallurgical Industry, and the China National Nonferrous Metals  Industry Corporation, as well as experts from a few domestic  iron and steel corporations who are in charge of technology,  took part in the conference on science, technology, and industry  of both sides for 1994. At the conference, experts from both  sides delivered many reports on iron and steel and materials and  exchanged information in this area, touching especially on the  prospects for cooperation in the field of rare earths.    Zhou Guangzhao said: Scientific and technological experts  from mainland China attended the conference at the invitation of  Taiwan's Institute of Industrial Technology and iron and steel  companies; they were warmly welcomed as compatriots by their  counterparts in Taiwan; while in Taiwan, they visited the Taiwan  Central Research Institute, the Taiwan Institute of Industrial  Technology, the Iron and Steel Corporation in Gaoxiong, Taiwan's  Qinghua University, Jiaotong University, the Xinzhu  Science-Based Industrial Park, and the Palace Museum of Taiwan.    Zhou Guangzhao noted: Mainland China's iron and steel output  has topped 80 million metric tons, and further efforts will be  made to expand production. In addition to expanding the output  quantitatively, efforts will also be made to promote development  qualitatively.    He said: There has been notable development in Taiwan's iron  and steel industry in recent years. Although the island's steel  output is much lower than ours, their technology is more  advanced. To bring about a massive development of the iron and  steel industry in Mainland China in the future, we can invite  Taiwan counterparts to participate in certain forms of  cooperation, including cooperation in learning from the  automated management system for the iron and steel industry  developed by Taiwan.    [Zhou]: ""I think scientific and technological personnel from  both sides are very enthusiastic about strengthening  cross-strait scientific and technological cooperation.""    Zhou Guangzhou, president of CAS, said: Scientific and  technological personnel from both sides of the strait are every  enthusiastic about strengthening cross-strait scientific and  technological cooperation. The Taiwan counterparts we have met  have demonstrated great interest in expanding cross-strait  cooperation. There are many problems in scientific and  technological cooperation, however, that require further  improvement. For example, we are all Chinese, and we all hope  for the peaceful reunification of China. However, at present  there is no direct air service. Actually, the flight time from  Beijing to Taipei is less than two hours, but to go to Taipei,  one must go through Hong Kong. Wang Fosong, vice president of  CAS, had planned to go to Taiwan, but he was unable to go  because of his status. Many people in Taiwan have expressed  their dissatisfaction with this. I believe many obstacles will  be overcome in the days to come.    Zhou Guangzhao: First, we hope science and technology  circles on both sides will strengthen cooperation and exchange  in the area of personnel and information. In the future, both  sides should cooperate in earnest. On the one hand they should  cooperate in transforming scientific and technological  achievements into productive forces and expanding the production  of rare earths in China, which occupies an advantageous position  in the world's rare earth resources. This is because Taiwan  needs rare earth materials in developing its high technology.  Taiwan can join us in making further studies on investing in  the establishment of a rare earth joint venture enterprise. At  present, science and technology circles of Mainland China and  Taiwan are conducting further consultations on relevant projects  for this year. Responsible persons from the Taiwan Institute of  Industrial Technology will soon visit the mainland. It is  expected that some agreements on cooperation projects may be  concluded by the mainland and Taiwan.    [Zhou]: ""I had always wanted to visit Taiwan. I had also  heard many stories from people who have visited Taiwan, but to  go there in person is different from hearing from other people.  I really felt as if we were one family. I felt the cordiality  and the warmth. They gave us a warm reception.""    In conclusion, Zhou Guangzhao stressed: Through this visit  to Taiwan we have gained some personal experience. Taiwan's  science and technology circles have overcome difficulties,  welcomed their counterparts from the mainland without a hitch,  and successfully convened this beneficial conference. With  actual deeds, they have expressed their strong desire to push  for closer scientific and technological cooperation between both  sides. Taiwan has made great progress in developing high  technology, especially in the area of computers and  microelectronic chips. Their methods of introducing new  technologies, making use of them, and assimilating them are  worth emulating by the mainland. Both the mainland and Taiwan  have their strong points in developing science and technology.  We should strengthen cooperation in this area.     "

Team briefing has failed as a management tool because it is a one-way channel of communication - top downwards. It offers no facility whatever for ideas and information about the performance of the business to flow from the workforce back up to senior management. The Industrial Society used - perhaps it still does - to promote team briefing by saying it was a technique modelled on the way the Roman army briefed troops before a battle. Doing business in Britain today may feel like fighting in a battlefield, but all the evidence is that successful companies are the ones tha harness the goodwill and enthusiasm of their people to the future growth and vitality of their business. Management tools that simply pander to the autocratic style of management that is all too prevalent in British companies merely contribute to the continuing failure of those companies to climb out of the recession and hide the ineptitude of chief executive officers who, unfortunately, lack leadership skills required of Roman generals.

0,FT944-3088 ,"FT944-3088 _AN-ELOCSABLFT 941215   FT  15 DEC 94 / US inflation tepid despite rapid growth      By MICHAEL PROWSE      WASHINGTON   US consumer price inflation remains subdued despite further evidence of robust economic growth, official figures indicated yesterday. The Labour Department said consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent last month and by 2.7 per cent in the year to November - in line with market projections. The 'core' consumer price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components and thus provides a better guide to underlying trends, rose only 0.1 per cent last month and by 2.8 per cent on an annual comparison. Over the past three months core consumer prices have been even better behaved, rising at only 2.3 per cent a year. The encouraging inflation figures were not expected to dissuade the Federal Reserve from pushing short-term interest rates higher in coming months, although they reduced pressure for a rise next week. Separate figures from the Federal Reserve yesterday indicated the economy was rapidly absorbing spare productive capacity. Industrial production rose 0.5 per cent last month, bringing the gain in the past year to 5.7 per cent. Manufacturing output rose 0.8 per cent last month and by 6.7 per cent on an annual basis. The rate of capacity utilisation in manufacturing rose to 84.4 per cent, well above the long-run average. Production gains were broadly based with output of consumer goods, business equipment and construction supplies rising 0.6 per cent, 0.7 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively last month. Figures yesterday also showed a small increase in the current account deficit to Dollars 41.7bn (Pounds 26.7bn) in the third quarter from Dollars 37.9bn in the second period. While agreeing that immediate prospects for economic growth and inflation are excellent, many US forecasters have reservations about the outlook for 1995.

Meadows, Donella H. Meadows is an adjunct professor of  environmental and policy studies at Dartmouth College.      PLAINFIELD, N.H.      Earth Day is at its best at the neighborhood level, with nature hikes and trash  pickups -- but it's bigger than that. It brings forth resounding speeches by  politicians, some of them sincere, but it's bigger than that, too. There are  Hollywood events, TV specials and ads telling us how various corporations love  the planet, but it's much bigger than that.    Every school in Thailand is planting a tree; every church in Costa Rica is  giving an Earth sermon; there are concerts in the Soviet Union, a rain-forest  roadshow in Japan and a beach cleanup in Tanzania -- but I think, and hope,  that Earth Day is bigger than all that.    If we're wise and lucky, Earth Day 1990 can be one of those peoples'  demonstrations, like the ones in Berlin and Leipzig and Wenceslas Square, that  launch a revolution. The revolutionary opportunity is not the turnover of one  government for another, nor even the establishment of a new idea of government.  It's bigger than that. The potential revolution is equivalent to only two  others in human history -- the Agricultural and the Industrial revolutions.    About 8,000 years ago, when there were just 10 million people in the world,  some hunter-gatherers started domesticating animals, cultivating plants and  founding humanity's first permanent settlements. They altered the face of the  planet and the thoughts of humankind.    For the first time it made sense to own land. People who stayed in one place  could accumulate things. The ideas of wealth, inheritance, trade, money and  power were born. Some people lived on excess food produced by others and became  full-time potters, toolmakers, musicians, scribes, priests, soldiers or kings.  Thus arose, for better or worse, the division of labor, experts, armies and  bureaucracies.    As its inheritors, we think of that revolution as a great step forward. At the  time it was a mixed blessing. Agriculture was not a better way of life, but a  necessary one, because of increasing population and decreasing game. Settled  farmers got more food from an acre of land, but the food was of lower quality  and less variety and it required a lot more work. Farmers became vulnerable, as  nomads never were, to weather, disease, pests, invasion and oppression from  their own emerging ruling class. Since they no longer moved away from their  wastes, they experienced humankind's first environmental problems.    The Industrial Revolution was also a brilliant adaptation to the problem of  populations growing beyond their technology and resource base. Agriculture was  a response to wildlife scarcity; industry to land and energy scarcity. Around  1750, when there were 800 million people in the world, the Industrial  Revolution began with science and coal and led quickly to steam engines and  capitalism (and later to capitalism's dissenting offshoot, communism).    Again, everything changed. There were roads and railroads, factories and smoke.  The cities swelled. Again, the change was a mixed blessing. Human labor became  harder and more demeaning. The environment turned unspeakably filthy. The  standard of living for most workers was far below that of a yeoman farmer. But  work in a factory was better than starving on the crowded land.    It's hard for us to appreciate how profoundly the Industrial Revolution changed  human thought, because we still think its thoughts. Historian Donald Worster  described the thought-revolution:    ""The capitalists . . . promised that, through the technological domination of  the Earth, they could deliver a more fair, rational, efficient and productive  life for everyone . . . . That meant teaching everyone to treat the Earth, as  well as each other, with a frank, energetic, self-assertiveness . . . . People  must . . . think constantly in terms of making money. They must regard  everything around them -- the land, its natural resources, their own labor --  as potential commodities that might fetch a profit in the market. They must  demand the right to produce, buy and sell those commodities without outside  regulation or interference . . . . As wants multipled, as markets grew more and  more far-flung, the bond between humans and the rest of nature was reduced to  the barest instrumentalism.""    That bare instrumentalism engendered incredible material success and, in a  world that now holds more than 5 billion people, severe environmental  degradation. It created the necessity for the next revolution, the one we  celebrate with Earth Day.    Few of us picking up trash and carrying Earth banners think we're participating  in a thoroughgoing revolution in human culture. But some of us suspect that's  the direction our concern will take us. We know it is impossible to go on  finding, moving and wasting oil, leveling forests, paving land, dumping poisons  and multiplying our numbers. A new way of life, a new set of thoughts must be  found.    Earth Day coordinator Denis Hayes clearly hopes to launch a thought-revolution:  ""I would really like to create a situation where people become more  introspective about themselves and think more carefully about purpose and  meaning in life. There is a sort of mindless, heedless rush -- an enormously  acquisitive preoccupation with more and more and more. I hope people will begin  to question our purpose and come up with more satisfying answers.""    A more satisfying answer is already here in the idea of sustainability -- a  word that has just surfaced in the discourse of the industrial world. It means  using the planet's resources in a way that permits future generations to have  some, too.    It's as impossible for us to describe a fully sustainable world as it would  have been for the farmers of BC 6000 to foresee present-day Iowa or the English  coal miners of 750 to imagine a Toyota assembly line. We only know that a  sustainable world would be highly efficient in its energy use. It would  respect, reuse and recycle materials. It would have a stable population. Human  needs for community, identity and self-respect would be met directly, rather  than with expensive material substitutes. The thoughts in people's heads would  be about harmony with nature, rather than conquest.    Like the other great revolutions, an environmental revolution will require  sacrifices and lead to enormous gains. It too will change the face of the land  and human institutions, hierarchies, self-definitions, cultures. It will take  centuries.    If it happens. There is no guarantee, of course. There were hunting-gathering  tribes who spurned the idea of agriculture and either died out or were engulfed  by powerful settled neighbors. There are agrarian societies that still resist  the industrial mind-set. An environmental revolution can't be piecemeal,  however, because the ecological problems it must solve are global. Humankind  has to pull off this revolution as a whole -- or sink as a whole into the  ecological and economic impoverishment of a culture that has failed to adapt to  historical necessity.    William D. Ruckelshaus, former administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency, recently wrote about the enormous nature of the challenge:    ""Can we move nations and people in the direction of sustainability? Such a move  would be a modification of society comparable in scale to only two other  changes: the Agricultural Revolution of the late Neolithic and the Industrial  Revolution of the past two centuries.    ""Those revolutions were gradual, spontaneous and largely unconscious. This one  will have to be a fully conscious operation, guided by the best foresight that  science can provide . . . .

C. Tsai]    [text] Taipei, March 18 (CNA) -- The government on Friday  [18 March] pledged to accelerate the development of the Changhua  Coastal Industrial Zone in central Taiwan, where 15 domestic  steelmakers are planning to establish a steel complex.    Officials of the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under  the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the bureau recently  gave a green light to the building of a large thermal power  plant in the zone by the state-run Taiwan Power Company.    Completion of the power plant will help ensure a sufficient  supply of electricity in the industrial zone, the officials  stressed.    The IDB will do its best to continue building the reclaimed  land in Changhua County into an industrial area in order to meet  the strong demand in Taiwan for land suitable for industrial  purposes, they said.    A total of 83 manufacturers of everything from precision  machinery to computers [words indistinct] applied to open plants  in the industrial zone, they added.    Meanwhile, the Taiwan Steel and Iron Industries Association  announced that 15 steelmakers have decided to join hands to  build a steel complex in the zone.    Coordinated efforts will help reduce development costs of  the  steel complex, thereby increasing the competitiveness of the  domestic steelmakers, he elaborated.    He said the complex will help make Taiwan self-sufficient in  steel. Taiwan imported 15 million tons of steel products last  year, making it the world' third-largest steel importing country.    The spokesman said that the 15 steelmakers are planning to  invest NT$30 [New Taiwan dollars] billion (us$1.13 billion) in  the five-year project, which will occupy an area of about 200  hectares for the production of a dozen steel products.    The IDB officials, however, said that they cannot promise  that the steel complex will be completed as planned by the  steelmakers because construction of the industrial zone itself  might cost more money and take longer than expected.

This project  investment company will set up a joint venture with a major  European integrated circuit company to engage in the manufacture  of chips and the finishing process for grad-scale integrated  circuits in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. It is estimated that the  entire production scale will entail a total investment of over  $1 billion (about 7.7 billion Hong Kong dollars).    Wang Dianpu, director of the Shenzhen Saige [6357 2706]  Group, a major shareholder in the Chinese investment company,  indicated when attending a meeting marking the establishment of  the project's Chinese investment company in Shenzhen yesterday,  that the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Grand-Scale Integrated Circuit  Project is a national-level high-tech project which was approved  by the State Planning Commission in July 1991 and which has the  backing of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and relevant leaders of  the State Council. After more than two years' preparation, the  project's Chinese investment company, namely Shenzhen Saige  High-Tech Joint-Stock Investment Company Limited, was finally  set up in Shenzhen with a registered capital of 280 million  yuan. The company has the following five shareholders: The  Shenzhen Saige Group as the assets trustee for the Shenzhen  Government (with a 62.2-percent shareholders' rights); the  Shenzhen New Industry Investment Company Incorporated (with 7.1  percent shareholders' rights); the Shenzhen Urban Construction  Group (with a 12.5-percent shareholders' right); the Shenzhen  Zhongcheng Electronics Industrial Investment Joint-Stock Company  Limited (with a 10.7-percent shareholders' right); and the  Shenzhen Changhe Industrial Company Limited (with a 7.1-percent  shareholders' right; this company is a joint venture between  Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Holdings Limited, Hutchison Whampoa  Company Limited, and relevant companies in Shenzhen). Wang  Dianpu also noted that it is just a temporary arrangement that  the company consists of the aforementioned five shareholders  only and the company plans to invite a number of major  enterprises in Shenzhen to be shareholders.    Wang Dianpu pointed out that the Shenzhen Saige High-Tech  Joint-Stock Investment Company Limited, during the coming  period, will place stress on developing the design, manufacture,  packing, testing technology, and supplementary industries for  grand-scale integrated circuits. To this end, the company will  make full use of all preferential policies granted by the state;  develop new and high technology; carry out diversified  operations; uphold the orientation of internationalizing  investment, product, market, technology, able personnel, and  management; and explore and create a new pattern for China's  new- and high-tech industries. From a long-term point of view,  the company plans to turn itself into a pluralistic  transnational company with real economic strength.    The Shenzhen-Hong Kong Grand-Scale Integrated Circuit  Project  will be developed by phases in the form of a Sino-foreign joint  venture. The first phase of the project includes the  establishment of a factory and design center in Shenzhen's  Futian Bonded Zone for the finishing prossess for grand-scale  integrated circuits, which will occupy an area of 37,000 square  meters. The joint venture will introduce world first class  production equipment and technology for the design, packaging,  and testing of integrated circuits of all kinds. The designed  production capacity in the first phase is expected to be 318  million pieces of packaged integrated circuits and most of the  products will be sold overseas. Entailing a total investment of  nearly $1 billion, the project will be jointly developed by the  Chinese investment company and an international first class  microelectronics company. The integrated circuit packaging and  testing factory for the joint venture will have the country's  highest output volume, largest production scale, and most  advanced technologies. The establishment of this project is of  great strategic significance to enhancing the level of China's  electronic industry, narrowing the gap between the electronic  technologies of China and the world, building up an electronic  industrial base in southern China, and to pushing forward the  industrial development of the Zhu Jiang Delta.    The second phase of the project includes the establishment  of  a world standard factory in Hong Kong for the initial processing  of grand-scale integrated circuits, thus turning the  Shenzhen-Hong Kong region into China's integrated circuit  production and export base. It has been learned that a 34,000  square meter factory for this purpose will be set up in Hong  Kong's Tai Po industrial town, which the Saige Group purchased  earlier. Recently, Hong Kong's Industrial Department planned to  withdraw the land as no construction had been carried out on it  long after the purchase; however, the Industrial Department  recently agreed to an extension. An investment of over $1  billion is needed for both the initial and finishing processes  to develop to an appropriate scale. At present, the first phase  of construction has entered the contract-signing stage and the  foreign partner is a first class major European integrated  circuit company.    Both the Chinese and foreign parties have agreed to examine  and approve the Chinese and English versions of three contracts  in early February; examine memorandums and the constitution of  the joint venture; and sign the three formal contracts upon the  approval of the boards of directors on both sides. According to  relevant plans, after the factory for the finishing process is  set up in Shenzhen's Futian Bonded Zone, it will first engage  itself in processing materials supplied by clients to gain  initial economic results; it will then expand the production  scale according to market changes and attain rollover  development relying mainly on the efficiency of the joint  venture. The finishing process is expected to be put into  production next year.     "

An open, painful economic policy helps to make clear with  the  help of competition, which companies are able to survive, but it  naturally has a negative effect on the farm industry, he said.    Tohver, speaking at a meeting of the Estonian Union of  Scientists Thursday [14 April], drew parallels with the  situation of the first years of the 1918-40 Republic of Estonia,  when a similar lack of capital and structural crisis hindered  economic development.    Industrial sector accounted for 33 percent of Estonia's GDP  in 1993, and no major changes are likely to happen this year, he  said. He added that the share of industry in the GDP of Finland  and Sweden, for example, was about one-fourth.    Industrial output in the country dropped 27 percent in  comparable prices last year when compared with the year before.  The decline was as big as 30 percent in state and  municipally-owned businesses.    Also the uptrend in industrial output recorded at the end of  last year again turned to a modest decline in the first months  of 1994. The output level at the end of March equalled that of  last year's late summer.    A big decline -- from 250,000 in 1985 to 175,000 in 1993 --  has taken place in the number of people occupied in the  industrial sector. About 10,000, or 6 percent of the total  work force in industry, were employed by private companies in  the sector last year. But they gave 26.5 percent of the total  output.    Only the farm industry increased its share in the country's  total industrial output. Energy sector kept its positions,  whereas all others showed decline.     "

Mr Jean-Claude Leny, chairman, told Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, that, in spite of the fall in profits, Framatome had performed better than expected last year. The group experienced a sharp fall in sales to FFr12.5bn in 1992 from FFr14.2bn in 1991. Framatome received a substantial nuclear order, its first for some time, at the start of this year and late last month won a Dollars 120m steam generator replacement contract from Asco of Spain for its Framatome-Siemens consortium. However, Mr Leny warned that 1993 would be more difficult than 1992 because of the continuing economic pressures. He said he did not envisage a recovery until 1994. Mr Leny was concerned that Framatome's position in China, one of the few buoyant markets for nuclear reactors, could be imperiled by the row between France and China over the sale late last year of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets to Taiwan by Dassault, the French state-controlled aircraft maker. The Framatome chairman told Les Echos that French companies 'have not yet stopped paying' for the damage to Sino-French relations. However, there were signs this week of an improvement when Alcatel, the telecommunications equipment division of Alcatel-Alsthom, the state-controlled industrial group that owns 44 per cent of Framatome, won Dollars 400m of contracts in China. Alcatal Alsthom saw net sales rise to FFr161.65bn in 1992 from FFr160.08bn in 1991. The group said it had suffered from the strengthening of the franc after the autumn currency crisis. The level of orders was virtually stable at FFr166bn last year, against FFr165.3bn in 1991.   Companies:-  Framatome.     Alcatel Alsthom.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

Owing to the larger number of shares in issue, earnings per share fell by 15.6 per cent to 617 cents, from 731 cents. The dividend, however, was maintained at 350 cents a share. Turnover rose to R6.78bn, from R6.46bn, but operating earnings fell to R295m, from R434m. Amic's share of earnings from associates rose to R210m, from R206m, and income from investments and interest rose to R93m, from R78m. Of the main operating subsidiaries, Highveld Steel was hardest hit, with attributable earnings falling by 26 per cent to R71m, from R96m. Mondi, the unlisted forest products offshoot, posted a 54 per cent fall in attributable earnings to R51m, from R110m. Earnings of associates AECI and Dorbyl fell by 12 and 22 per cent respectively. Although earnings at Scaw Metals, a wholly-owned subsidiary, fell by 9 per cent to R76.5m from R84m, it was still the largest contributor to Amic's earnings. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, defended the performance of Mondi, saying many of its main international competitors were making large losses. He said temporary machine shutdowns, mothballings and closures had been necessary to keep tight control of inventories and working capital. A feature of the year was a review of the structure of Amic. The objectives were threefold: to make the group more financially efficient; to rationalise industrial interests held jointly with Anglo American; and to reduce the group's exposure to commodity cycles. Although Mr Boyd predicted another difficult year, he anticipated earnings would bottom out in 1993.   Companies:-  Anglo American Industrial Corp.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The result, more than double the L742bn lost in 1991, reflected the recession, which has cut demand for primary petrochemical products, and continuing severe price competition. Sales, adjusted for disposals, fell by 8.2 per cent to L11,155bn EniChem said prices for primary petrochemicals products had fallen between 10 per cent and 20 per cent last year as a result of weak demand and overcapacity. The Italian market had been hit particularly hard owing to the slowdown in the auto, building and textile industries. EniChem's losses, which included L300bn in provisions for environmental protection measures, came in spite of indications last year that the group might be able to contain losses to within L1,000bn due to cost-savings and a big cash injection from the Eni parent company. However, the group's finances appear to have deteriorated steadily during the year. Operating losses deepened by L231bn to L308bn in spite of lower raw material prices and attempts to contain fixed costs. Meanwhile, interest costs, adjusted for disposals, rose by a further L131bn to L893bn in 1992. Total group debt rose to L7,391bn from L7,004bn, in spite of the cash injection. EniChem has been struggling to restructure to reduce costs. The workforce was cut by over 4,000 employees last year, contributing to a L80bn saving on the wage bill. In July, formal approval is due for a plan to merge 10 wholly-owned subsidiaries with the EniChem parent company, which is forecast to produce annual savings of about L200bn   Companies:-  Enichem.

0,FT932-8728 ,"FT932-8728 _AN-DERDAABRFT 930518   FT  18 MAY 93 / Nuclear industry cautioned on safety      By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent   THE nuclear industry has not paid enough attention to the role of human error when setting safety standards, the Health and Safety Commission, the government advisory body, says. In two reports published yesterday the commission urged the industry to 'maintain safety standards in the face of competing pressures' - such as the pursuit of profit. Human error was responsible for the incidents at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, the world's worst nuclear accidents, as well as the Clapham rail disaster and the Piper Alpha oil explosion, the commission argued. Professor Terry Lee, a member of the commission's advisory committee on the safety of nuclear installations, which wrote the reports, said that a 'step change' would be needed to bring about a 'culture of safety' in the nuclear industry, although technological standards were already extremely high. Nuclear site operators felt that they had 'got as far as they can with introduction of technological fixes and now are on a plateau', he added. He recommended that the emphasis shift to people. He said that even small details such as employees' 'age and being maritally contented' may be relevant to safety. Professor John Hockney, chairman of the commission's advisory committee, expressed concern at the growing amount of nuclear waste stored at nuclear sites. 'We are not saying it is unsafe, but we would rather have it in one place,' he added. The committee is anxious because plans for an underground store for nuclear waste to be built by UK Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste disposal company, are progressing so slowly. The Pollution Inspectorate's report on the public consultation about Thorp, British Nuclear Fuels' controversial nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, now appears unlikely to reach Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, before the end of the month.

Worldwide efforts, mainly in the United States, are  underway to standardize multimedia communication formats and the  objective of the committee will be to establish a forum to  coordinate future interconnectability of the wide variety of  equipment expected to be offered by manufacturers. The objective  is to seek expansion of market potential by providing for user  convenience.    The temporary name of the research committee will be  ""Multimedia Promotion Research Committee [MPRC]."" The initial  call for the committee was made by the Communications Industry  Association of Japan (chaired by Jun Jinguji, president of Oki  Electric Industry Co., Ltd.) and NEC, the two firms mentioned  above and Hitachi, Ltd., Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric  Corporation, Oki Electric Industry Co., Ltd., Sony Corporation,  Sharp Corporation, Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., and Matsushita  Communication Industrial Co., Ltd. have been fonfirmed as  participants.    The research committee will coordinate multimedia standards  for newly developed information telecommunications equipment and  is expected to submit proposals to the government concerning  deregulation and legislation necessary for building the  next-generation communications network infrastructure to be used  by multimedia companies. The 11 companies and three related  organizations including the Communications Industry Association  of Japan, the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, and  the Japan Electronic Industry Development Association have just  established a preparatory committee which will decide on the  activities to be handled by the research committee.    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications estimates that  the multimedia industry will expand into a huge market covering  hardware, software and services valued at 123 trillion yen by  the year 2010, and electrical, information and communications  companies are actively engaged in product development.

An umbrella agreement was signed at the weekend in Beijing with the Chinese Ministry of Chemical Industry and subsidiary agreements with prospective partners. Ventures include plastics manufacturing, the production of tanning agents and dyes, and the packaging of photographic film. Mr Dieter Becher, a Bayer board member responsible for Asia, announced the establishment of a holding company in Beijing to oversee Bayer's business in China, one of the first such foreign holding companies on the mainland. Mr Becher said: 'Bringing our best technologies here is the best way a company like Bayer can contribute to the development of an advanced chemical industry in this country.' Bayer's announcement follows a visit to China earlier this month by Chancellor Helmut Kohl aimed at boosting the German business presence. Agreements signed during the Kohl visit totalled more than Dollars 2bn and included the sale of six Airbus A340's and a contract for the construction of an 18-kilometre underground link in Guangzhou. Bayer's decision to establish a presence in China also reflects growing competition among chemicals and pharmaceutical companies for a share of a booming market. Mr Becher said Bayer's exports to China totalled DM520m (Pounds 206m) in 1992, but 'it would be difficult to increase this on the basis of imports alone'. Bayer's umbrella agreement with the Chemical Industry Ministry covers co-operation in planning and construction of chemical plant, and in engineering and technology transfer. The German company will also manufacture Baygon, its well-known insecticide, under licence with the Huabao Group in Guangdong province. Marketing starts next year. Projects under consideration include production of pharmaceuticals, and animal health and crop protection products.   Companies:-  Bayer.     Huabaco Group.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

BNFL's two largest foreign customers, Germany and Japan, are reconsidering the wisdom of reprocessing nuclear waste. The chairmen of the German electrical utilities are engaged in discussions with politicians to reach a consensus on energy policy. These discussions include ceasing reprocessing in favour of the cheaper option of direct storage. BNFL's contracts include clauses enabling its customers to withdraw from reprocessing. The Japanese government has been rocked by international protest surrounding the recent plutonium shipment from France - a taste of things to come if Thorp begins operation. Technical problems with the Monju fast breeder reactor and widespread fear of regional political instability caused by Japan's plutonium surplus, has prompted a reappraisal of its commitment to the plutonium path. For these and other reasons, not limited to Germany and Japan, the likelihood of BNFL obtaining contracts beyond the first decade of Thorp's operations is remote. Further, it is doubtful whether existing contracts for the first decade will run according to BNFL's plan. The UK government's refusal to underwrite BNFL's contracts with Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear is a sign that BNFL's optimism is unwarranted. Thorp's profit seems destined to change from meagre to negative. The question facing the UK government is whether to operate Thorp and create a costly decommissioning problem (even using BNFL's minimal estimate of Pounds 900m) or to recognise that times have changed since 1977 when the go-ahead for Thorp was given. The only rational conclusion is to scrap Thorp. Richard Le Coyte, nuclear campaign, Greenpeace, Canonbury Villas, London N1 2PN   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

It suffers great  damage if it does not protect itself against illegal spying, he  said at the presentation of the 1993 Constitutional Protection  Report in Bonn yesterday.    The FRG interior minister criticized with unusually harsh  words the increasing activities of Eastern intelligence services  in industrial espionage. It is ""virtually crazy"" that countries  which have ""nothing to eat"" are spying on other people. This  practice does not fit into friendly cooperation.    The best and most effective prevention of industrial  espionage is, according to Kanther, the security check law,  which has come into force these days. The recipient countries  -- often states in the areas of crises in the Near and Middle  East -- often use their intelligence services or other  acquisition organizations, which work like intelligence  services, to acquire illegally goods that are relevant for  armament, the Constitutional Protection report says. The  incorrect declaration of goods, the forging of end-user  certificates, or the diversion of goods via third countries to  cover up the true recipient are typical. The recipient  countries of technologies, which are subject to export  restrictions, also use their official or semiofficial  representations in the FRG for illegal acquisition. For German  companies it is not always clear, the report says, that their  products are to be used for military purposes, in particular if  they are not subject to export restrictions.    Another possibility to get access to protected technology or  the corresponding know-how in Germany lies in the establishment  or purchase of companies or the purchase of shares in German  companies, the report adds. In particular smaller companies  that are in economic difficulty could become the target of  foreign intelligence services or similar organizations.  Counterintelligence pointed to corresponding efforts by the  Russian intelligence services already in the past. [passage  omitted]     "

More than 60,000 people died in thousands of incidents  across  the country between January and October.    And Zou described the toll in lives and damage as  unprecedented.    Governments at all levels should make every effort to stem  the rise, he said on Tuesday to the third national  tele-conference on industrial safety since July.    He also called for new laws to protect workers and to punish  firms which put them in danger.    Protecting workers has an important role in China's economic  development, said Zou, adding that governments and enterprises  must do all they can to solve any problems.    ""While the workers are making contributions to our country,  we must bear responsibility for their safety,"" said Zou.    The tragic rise in the number of accidents was particularly  marked in foreign-funded firms and collectively-run mines.    Zou called for new laws on industrial safety to be drafted  as  soon as possible and for the powers of watch dog groups to be  strengthened.    And he stressed that any accident caused by negligence or  bureaucracy must be punished severely.    Safety inspections should be carried out regularly, he said,  adding that they should target accident black spots such as  foreign- funded or township enterprises.    He also hoped the press could improve public awareness of  the  importance of industrial safety by high-lighting major accidents  which claim many lives or cause severe damage.    Labour Minister Li Boyong blamed the accident figures on  poor  discipline, management, and operation and lack of proper  supervision.    Li also accused some managers of going for higher output at  the expense of their workers' safety.    He also attacked the illegal practice of dismantling firms  safety supervisory departments as they restructured their  managements.     "

Most observers are bullish about prospects. ICI is benefiting from its exposure to the buoyant US and Asian markets, and the recovery in the UK. The only fly in the ointment is continental Europe, but US groups that have already reported second-quarter results have noted some upturn in demand there. Bayer, the German group, also issued bullish forecasts this month. The continuing improvement in demand will mainly help the industrial chemicals division and regional businesses. Prices for some of ICI's important products - such as PVC, titanium dioxide and PET - have been rising strongly in recent months. Brokers Kleinwort Benson expect the industrial division to post operating profits of Pounds 35m to Pounds 54m, with the regional businesses registering about Pounds 15m. Analysts will be listening out for chairman Sir Denys Henderson's comments about whether the upturn is driven mainly by rising demand. Another explanation is that the recent strong growth has partly been the consequence of stock-building, with customers buying supplies in advance of possible price rises. The only business that could report lower operating profits is the paint division. Brokers Kleinwort Benson are expecting flat results at Pounds 32m, but James Capel is predicting a fall year on year, because of a squeeze on prices in the UK decorative market. Raw material prices, essentially pigments, have also been rising, putting pressure on margins. Most analysts expect the interim dividend to remain unchanged at 10.5p.

'There is just no market for the 30 to 40 per cent increase in British capacity that the new factory would bring,' said BTC's director-general, Mr John Wilson. Under-utilisation was running at about 20 per cent in the European textile industry, he said. The Pounds 157m Belfast factory for Hualon of Taiwan is the largest project ever handled by Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board and would employ 2,000 workers to produce about 23,000 tonnes, of polyester-cotton fabric a year. The IDB yesterday welcomed the commission's decision and said it was optimistic that the project would proceed, although contracts had not yet been signed. Hualon is one of the Far East's leading textile manufacturers, with sales of Pounds 500m in 1992. Much of the output from the Belfast factory would be for downmarket garments, about 40 per cent of which are currently imported into Europe. The company argues that with many European producers having abandoned this market to switch to higher-quality products, the new factory would be substituting imports rather than displacing European producers. However, the BTC says there is 'no proof whatsoever' that Hualon will limit itself to low-cost products. 'The investment is vast and they are going to have to find a huge market for such gigantic volumes,' said Mr Wilson. He also disputed the number of jobs that will be created. 'Up to 2,000 jobs in an area of high unemployment is certainly a compelling case,' he said. 'But there has been no explanation of where these jobs will come from. We find Hualon's figures startling in that the factory will be highly capital intensive.'   Companies:-  Hualon Corp.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Not true. BNFL would only have such fears if we doubted the professionalism and integrity of the regulatory bodies concerned, namely Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, or if we did not believe in Mr Major's government's commitment to economic growth, which is incompatible with turning Britain's second largest industrial project into this country's largest white elephant. As we entertain neither proposition, we remain confident that we shall obtain the necessary authorisations from HMIP and Maff to enable this environmentally sound project, with its Pounds 9bn of firm advance orders, to start up. Could I correct three factual points in your editorial. First, contrary to the misinformation put out by Greenpeace, which it has agreed not to repeat, there is no credible risk of our German or Japanese customers withdrawing from their contracts. On the contrary, the chairmen of the two German utilities claimed by Greenpeace to be considering their position have written to me to confirm that they intend to honour their contracts. Second, BNFL has not suggested the decommissioning costs of Thorp will be Pounds 1.2bn, but rather Pounds 750m in 1989 money or about Pounds 900m in January 1993 money. Third, we have repeatedly made it clear that these decommissioning costs will be fully written off over the first 10 years of Thorp's life. We expect the plant to be in operation for at least 20 years and, as in the case of BNFL's Magnox power stations, it could well be profitably extended further.

The index, released today, shows that monthly growth in recruitment accelerated to its highest level in the index's three-year history, providing further evidence of economic recovery. Purchasing prices were reported to be up significantly, however, possibly indicating inflationary pressures. The purchasing managers' price index was 57.8 per cent. The index, which surveys 250 purchasing managers, measures changes in economic performance between consecutive months, with any figure above 50 per cent implying a monthly rise. The reported rise in prices is slightly at odds with the Confederation of British Industry's most recent survey, which implied a more modest growth in prices. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, the organiser of the index, said the main reason was that rising factory demand was creating shortages of vital manufacturing components. Pulp and steel were said to be in particularly short supply, affecting the prices of production and packaging materials. The shortages are feeding through to delivery periods. The suppliers' delivery times index fell to 42.7 per cent - its lowest recorded level. The institute said the fall reflected shortages in many sectors. These trends appear to tally with the broader output figures, which showed that the engineering and vehicle manufacturing sectors - significant users of steel - had recorded the highest level of monthly growth of any sector, with the output index at 68. Strong growth was recorded in timber, paper, textiles, and food and drink, as well as in the office machinery and electrical sectors. The chemical industry, rubber and plastics processing, and mining performed worse, with monthly output growth reported to have slowed. Monthly Trends.

And last year's sales were 42 per cent up on 1992, the State  Statistics Bureau said yesterday.    Encouraged by the rise in profits and sales, Chinese  factories have been busy gearing up industrial production since  the beginning of the year, according to bureau economists.    Output in January this year jumped by more than 33 per cent  over the same period last year.    The bureau has not released sales and profits for this  January. But January's sales of finished products were 1.3 per  cent up on the corresponding month in the previous year.    However, the loss-making factories which are sitting on  large  amounts of raw materials and stocks still pose a big headache  for China's industrial development.    Most loss-making factories are State-owned enterprises.    And over one quarter of firms in the State-dominated heavy  industry sector reported operating losses last year.    The performance of these loss-makers was considered  particularly poor given that more than 68 per cent of last  year's profits were generated by heavy industry.    Industry will have to improve efficiency as well as gear up  production, according to the bureau.    Industrial production should slow down a bit this year due  to  the government's brakes-on industrial development policy, which  aims to safeguard the health of the national economy.    The central government's targeted growth of industrial  production should be slightly above 20 per cent this year, which  is essential for ensuring a 9 per cent of GDP growth in China,  official sources say.    The bureau also said that the industrial production in  coastal areas is better than that of the country's land-locked  regions.    Industrial enterprises in East China's coastal Shandong  Province topped last year's output and sales league in the  country.    However, Shanxi Province, a major coal producer in North  China, came bottom, according to the bureau.     "

When  the State Council recently promulgated the ""Outline of State  Industrial Policy in the Nineties,"" people might not have  anticipated that in the next decade, a comprehensive rural  economic system integrated with agriculture, trade, industry,  communications, construction, and service trades will gradually  take shape to facilitate an all-around development of the rural  economy; that the strains on infrastructure and basic industries  will be greatly alleviated to help the national economy develop  at a more solid and substantive pace; that along with the rapid  rise of a number of pillar industries, many people will move  into new living quarters and drive privately owned vehicles,  telephones and family computers will no longer be in exclusive  use by a small number of people, and foreign trade mix and  conditions will be improved markedly and China will play a  bigger role in the global economic and trade arena; that  thriving high- and new-tech industries will bring about a  noticeable improvement in the organizational structure and  pattern of industries; and that there will be a big leap in the  level of industrial technology. All of these will become  materialized under the guidance of industrial policy, the target  that the macroeconomic regulation and control is aimed at.    China has launched an important program of applying  industrial policy to guide the national economy to embark on the  optimal course while bringing into full play the role of markets.    I.    To use simple language, industrial policy is aimed mainly at  readjusting industrial structure.    In any country, industrial structure always takes shape in a  given stage of economic development. Take, for example, China's  pace-setting industries: In the 1960s and 1970s, light  industrial products consisting of dozens of components, such as  bicycles, watches, and sewing machines, became the dominant  groups of consumer goods. In the 1980s, machinery and  electrical products consisting of several hundred components,  such as color television sets, refrigerators, and video  cassettes, were the vogues of the times. Since the beginning of  the 1990s, especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave his talks  during his southern tour, the Chinese economy has developed  rapidly. What Chinese people on the street feel right now is  that the traditional consumer goods are saturated and urgently  need to be replaced by groups of higher quality capital- and  technology-intensive consumer goods; and that electronic  products, automobiles, residential houses, and other new  products will become leading consumer goods.    With the scale of the Chinese economy being multiplied  several hundredfold as compared with the beginning of the PRC,  the previous simple management system of a planned economy has  become outdated, while the establishment of a socialist market  economic structure is not yet complete. As a result, aimless  development, redundant construction, and low efficiency have  occurred from time to time. On the one hand, much new capital  continues to be invested in traditional industries whose  products have already saturated the markets; on the other, new  industries which have not reached the threshold of large-scale  production cannot turn out highly competitive products. Take  the automobile industry, for example. China has over 120  automobile plants, more than the total number of plants in the  world; however, its total output is less than that of a single  model manufactured by a foreign automobile company. If such a  situation characterized by laxness, chaos, and poor quality  remains for a long time to come, taking part in international  competition can only be an empty slogan.    Under the circumstances of developing a socialist market  economy, the government policymakers and economists are  anxiously trying to seek a new, effective control and regulatory  means.    They are attracted by the experiences of other countries: A  few newly developed nations, with foresight in the process of  developing a market-oriented economy, have their central  government draw up an industrial policy to standardize and  encourage industries which can serve as the foundations and  pacesetters for the national economy, thereby creating a healthy  situation characterized by both competition and a clear-cut  direction of development and making optimal and rational  allocation of resources. For example, Japan and Korea have  successively developed their automobile and electronics  industries from weak foundations. However, both countries  relied on the assistance and interference prescribed in the  state industrial policy to concentrate national resources and  prioritize the development of their industries. Through  assiduous efforts, the Japanese and Korean automobile and  electronics industries have come to dominate international  markets while bringing along the rapid growth of the national  economy and creating world-acclaimed economic miracles.    II.    Some people once suggested that since China wanted to  introduce a market economy, it was not necessary to formulate an  industrial policy as everything would be regulated by market  mechanisms. However, more experts held that simple market  regulation would inevitably lead to loss of resources and  opportunities, which were precisely the things China should  treasure. Besides, simple market regulation could not guarantee  the long-term development of agriculture and infrastructure.  Needless to say, the Asian countries with the same oriental  cultural background as China's had their central government draw  up a guiding industrial policy. Even the United States, which  is known for its free market economy, drew up an industrial  policy for developing space aviation and other high-technology  several decades ahead of time. These two views finally  converged on one point, that is, industrial policy and market  mechanisms are complementary to each other. On the one hand,  industrial policy aims to apply economic means to guide the  direction of industrial development, to change relations between  different relations so as to remedy defects and shortcomings of  market mechanisms, to coordinate and accumulate necessary  capital within a short period of time for carrying out some  major projects having a bearing on the overall situation, and to  promote the optimal allocation of resources. On the other hand,  maintaining the normal operation of market mechanisms and  promoting fair, equal, and open competition constitute the  important functions of industrial policy.    China first tried to formulate its industrial policy in the  late 1980s. In March 1989, the State Council, in the light of  needs at that time, promulgated the ""Decision Concerning the  Main Points of the Current Industrial Policy."" The ""decision""  outlined specific names of projects which the government would  support or restrict in the four areas of production, capital  construction, technical transformation, and foreign trade; as  well as a guarantee system. Strictly speaking, it was a policy  aimed at achieving short-term targets at that time, but it still  attracted extensive attention from many international  organizations and economic sectors abroad.    Since the early 1990s, the center of global economic  development has shifted to the Asian-Pacific region. Along with  China's further opening up and absorption of huge foreign  capital, the country has become a new economic growth point of  the Asian-Pacific region. Moreover, in the transition from a  planned to a market economy, the central government has been  required to conform with international economic trends in both  macro and micro economic operational mechanisms to provide  farsighted guidance for changes in industrial structure and to  accelerate the pace of China's modernization toward the 21st  century. Thus, the formulation of an industrial policy for  long-term allocation of resources was placed on the State  Council's agenda.    In line with the State Council's decision, the State  Planning  Commission took the lead in studying and coordinating the  formulation of an industrial policy. As the commission has been  changing its functions from drawing up annual plans and  allocating financial and material resources to drawing up medium  and long-term plans, the study and formulation of industrial  policy in the 1990s has become a major task of the commission.    Since 1992, the State Planning Commission, in a bid to pool  collective wisdom, invited economists and representatives from  departments, localities, and enterprises to various forums; and  convened a national industrial policy work conference. The  State Council's leaders personally participated in discussions  and listened to opinions at the conference.    Using as reference foreign countries' successful experiences  in formulating and implementing industrial policy and in the  light of the actual conditions in China, the basic principles  for the state industrial policy in the 1990s have been drawn up:  1) They conform with the objective law governing the process of  industrialization and modernization; 2) they conform with the  demand for establishing a socialist market economic structure;  3) they underscore the key areas and focus on solving major  issues having a vital bearing on the overall situation of the  national economy; and 4) they are feasible and can guarantee the  implementation of industrial policy through economic, legal, and  necessary administrative means.    In the process of formulating industrial policy, experts  conducted a host of research on verification of proof, data  analyses, and prediction of trends. After revisions to 14  drafts, the current ""Outline of State Industrial Policy in the  Nineties"" took shape. After discussion and approval by the  State Council's 16th executive meeting, it was promulgated for  implementation.    III.    The promulgated ""Outline of State Industrial Policy in the  Nineties"" contains a group of documents, mainly consisting of  two parts: 1) A framework of programmatic documents of a  guidance nature, which involve only agriculture, basic  industries, infrastructural facilities, and pillar industries,  and which allow enterprises and the market to play their optimum  role in the development of a number of key industries such as  foreign trade; 2) a series of practical special industrial  policies drawn up on the basis of the ""outline."" For example,  the ""Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry"" and other  special industrial policies on transportation, communications,  construction, electronics, machine-building, petrochemical  industries, and foreign trade, which will be drawn up  successively.    The entrepreneurs of several automobile groups from all  parts  of the country said: The ""Industrial Policy for the Automobile  Industry"" has enabled China's automobile industry to have a  direction and basis for healthy development since its  establishment over four decades ago. The annual production of  whole sedan manufacturing plants shall not be below 150,000  units; encouragement of the policy of investment and financing  through various channels; encouragement of the policy that  individuals should buy automobiles; discouragement of the policy  of depending on the state to buy automobiles; encouragement of  the consumption policy of using small automobiles; overall  planning for related industries; and other safety policies on  roads, car parking facilities, and inclusion of teaching of  traffic knowledge in elementary schools, which are stipulated in  the industrial policy, will have a decisive impact on the  reorganization and rapid development of China's automobile  industry.    Whether the state industrial policy drawn up by the central  government in consideration of overall and long-term interests  can be successfully turned into a giant motive force for the  development of the economy in the nineties depends on a secure  implementation system. According to the arrangements of the  state, the implementation of the industrial policy will depend  mainly on the departments in charge of various trades; however,  it will be implemented under the overall coordination of the  State Planning Commission. Meanwhile, the establishment of a  secure system for the implementation of the industrial policy  and a supervision, checking, and evaluation system should be  speedily completed. Economic administrative departments dealing  with planning, finance, banking, taxation, customs, foreign  trade, securities, industrial and commercial administration, and  management of state-owned assets will coordinate with one  another to form a force to push forward the smoother  implementation of the state industrial policy.    According to a disclosure by an authoritative source, in the  future when the state is drawing up economic policies, it will  give preferential treatment to industries just as it gave such  treatment to regions in the past. Morever, the state will  render necessary support to important industrial projects being  built in central and western China.    The scientific guidance provided by the industrial policy  will play a sacred role in stimulating the development of  China's economy.     "

This will mark  a new stage in China's international commercial satellite  launching service. By 2000, China will have launched 30  satellites for overseas countries or regions.    According to a briefing by an official of the China Great  Wall Industrial Corporation, a number of commercial satellite  launching contracts are being implemented, and new contracts are  under negotiation. This year, China will also use Long March-II  E rockets to launch another satellite, the ""Asia-Pacific Two,""  for the APCSC and the (?Plutus) B 3 communications satellite for  Australia. In 1995 China will launch three satellites for  overseas clients -- it will use a Long March-II E rocket to  launch the ""Asia Two"" communications satellite for the Asia  Communications Satellite Company Limited; a Long March-III B  rocket to launch the ""International Satellite 7 A,"" a heavy-duty  communications satellite, for the International Satellite  Organization; and a Long March-II E rocket to launch ""(?Aicosda)  One,"" a high-power, direct- transmission satellite for the  United States.

After 1996 China will use an improved  version of the Long March-II C rocket to launch a number of  low-orbit iridium communications satellites for Motorola  Corporation of the United States.    The China Great Wall Industrial Corporation official said:  China's commercial satellite launching service and cooperation  in the manufacture of satellites constitute a useful supplement  to the international market, and also provide a new choice for  international satellite clients. This is also a responsibility  and obligation China should undertake for the peaceful  development and utilization of outer space resources.     "

The Ministry of Industry  has prepared a comprehensive plan, and the Board of Standards  and the Industrial Regulatory Agency will take part in  implementing this plan. The purpose is to protect the Egyptian  consumer and assure production quality, in order to guarantee  that all goods available in the Egyptian market are in  compliance with specifications. Actions will be taken against  companies and factories that produce goods that do not comply  with specifications, and the rights of Egyptian consumers will  be safeguarded.    Dr. Ibrahim Fawzi, the Minister of Industry and Mineral  Resources, says that implementation of a comprehensive plan to  protect the Egyptian consumer and assure production quality will  begin in mid-April 1994. He added that the Ministry of Industry  and its various agencies in the quality control field--the Board  of Standards and Production Quality, and the Industrial  Regulatory Agency--will participate in executing this plan.    Clearly, quality has become a basic element in the  production  process, especially with the application of free economic rules,  marketing mechanisms, and the increased growth of private sector  activity. Consequently, the importance of the role of  competition among goods in the Egyptian market has increased.  Minister Fawzi stressed that ""we welcome honest competition.  However, whenever it is not honest, if--for example--some  merchants lower prices at the expense of quality, in order to  increase the competitive possibilities of a specific product by  illegal means, the role of specifications takes over.  Specifications make clear the acceptable limits for the level of  desired quality for each product."" He added that if simple  production defects are found in manufactured goods, that must be  explained to the consumer and a distinction made between  first-class and second-class goods. This can be done with regard  to goods that are not connected to the citizens' health or  safety, such as products of pottery and china for example, when  the defect in its manufacturing is simple and would not affect  the product's capability to perform its consumer function.    ""As for goods dealing with the citizen's health and safety,  their production specifications must be strictly adhered to. Any  deviation from these specifications will result in speedy  actions that could lead to production stoppage for the  violators."" He added that the Board of Standards' role will  basically be to issue standardized specifications for products.  ""That will give assurances about the quality of goods entering  the Egyptian market, both for goods manufactured locally or  imported from abroad. This will result in stopping the  importation of leftover and surplus goods and preventing  attempts to bring them into the country, as if they were  first-class goods for sale at lower prices, passing them off as  products of a first-rate importer at a lower price than similar  goods produced locally and with better quality.""    The Minister of Industry stressed he will also be  continuously supervising the issuance of specifications, through  interaction with modern international developments and trends in  the industrial arena. He added that the Board of Standards will  issue compliance and quality seals. ""Goods manufactured locally,  as a condition for their circulation, must obtain the compliance  seal. These products basically include goods related to  citizens' security and health. The seal of compliance spells out  the basic specifications required for the manufacture of these  goods.    ""There are also other products that should obtain the seal  of  excellence. This is optional for the factories and companies,  which can ask that their products be given this symbol, after  giving assurances that these products are superior and more than  meet the minimum required specifications.    ""The new system with regard to goods that obtain the seal of  excellence includes the requirement to specify the advantages  that these goods have, which lead to their obtaining that  symbol. This gives the consumer an opportunity to learn about  them and confirm their fulfillment of those advantages in a  practical way. If any consumer finds a defect in the conditions  set forth for these goods that are marked as quality products,  he can submit a complaint. If he finds any product with defects,  the buyer can also complain either to the Board of Standards,  the Industrial Regulatory Agency, or the Ministry of Industry.  They will contact the manufacturing plant or company and take  the necessary actions to safeguard the consumer's rights.""    Dr. Ibrahim Fawzi added that, if complaints occur regarding  goods that do not meet specifications, the Industrial Regulatory  Agency will take the required actions to confirm the complaints'  accuracy. If that is confirmed, several agency experts will  inspect the plant or company that produced this merchandise.  That is done in complete cooperation and coordination with the  Board of Standards. When defects in certain products are found,  the required actions will be taken against the factories that  produced these goods. This includes withdrawing the seal of  compliance. This seal is a basic requirement for merchandising  these products. This applies to goods for which this symbol is  compulsory. The seal of excellence will also be withdrawn from  any product that has obtained it, when it is proved that it  violates specifications. The new system includes, for each  specified period of time, lists of goods that have received  seals of excellence and compliance, as well as products from  which those symbols were withdrawn. Periodic inspections will  also be made of products that have received the seal of  excellence. Samples will be selected at random and tested to  ensure they adhere to the required conditions.    The Minister of Industry stressed the importance of the  Egyptian consumer's right to obtain quality goods. This is basic  to the protection of the consumer and the quality of products.  The Ministry of Industry and its specified agencies are ready to  offer any assistance required by the consumer in this regard.     "

Though technopolises were meant to be like America's Silicon  Valley, they're degenerating into industrial parks. Problems  such as inadequate control by MITI and the use of technopolises  as ``good causes'' by regions and by politicians snaring public  works projects are behind the retreat from the original concept.    The concept of the technopolis, which started under the  jurisdiction of MITI in 1983, was to aim for innovation based on  the fostering of start-ups and industry-academia cooperation  rooted in the region.    However, today, ten years later, the reality of the  technopolis is very different from the original concept.    Local Governments Put Local Revitalization First,  Regionalism and Nurturing of New Industries Second    The biggest problem is that often the technopolises have  almost become industrial parks not very similar to the research  parks of Silicon Valley on which they were modeled. As local  governments put local revitalization first, they persist in  pursuing factories from Tokyo and Osaka companies, putting in  second place the nurturing of regional distinctiveness and new  industries. The corporations are under the influence of their  headquarters, which is fine when times are good. However, when  the economy plunges, people are quickly recalled and plans are  quickly cut. This makes it difficulty for long-term research to  survive.    Take Hamamatsu City in Shizuoka Prefecture, one of the 26  designated technopolis regions. Its geographic conditions are  favorable and it is blessed with local industries such as  musical instruments and motorcycles. Even here the business plan  is behind schedule.    Toda Industrial Park is at the core of the city's  technopolis  plan. The parceling out of the 100-hectare industrial park began  in March 1990. As the bubble economy still lingered then,  companies were very interested in entering the park. Before two  years were up, the park was 100% parceled out to 68  companies.    However, of the 68 companies, nine have yet to begin  building  one to two years after obtaining the land. That is because  companies had to reconsider totally their investments in plant  and equipment when the economy declined immediately after the  companies signed their contracts.    The sales contract the companies signed with Hamamatsu  includes an obligation to be in operation within three years of  obtaining the land. Companies which do not fulfill that  condition must pay a penalty or return the land to the city. If  this rule is strictly applied, companies will suffer and  Hamamatsu will lose companies it wooed. As a last resort, the  standard of ``operation within three years'' was changed to  ``construction begun within three years.''    However, since prospects are poor for economic recovery in  the latter half (October 1993 to March 1994) of this fiscal  year, meeting even the revised standard will be a tall order for  the companies. The three companies with an October 1993 deadline  have not submitted their applications for architectural approval  and cannot start construction in time. The remaining six  companies with deadlines in April 1994 or January 1995 are  conferring with Hamamatsu on how to meet the construction start  deadline even with scaled down plans for first stage  construction.    Retreat of Companies has Begun to Stand Out, a Region That  Hasn't Attracted Even One Company    Cases of companies giving up on technopolises have begun  appearing as the business climate has worsened. Automotive parts  manufacturer Shin Kobe Plastic had planned to build a factory at  Hiroshima's Chuo Technopolis, but in July 1992 it completely  retreated from the plan and returned the land to Hiroshima  Prefecture. ``Based on the direction of the automotive market,  we must give up on constructing a new plant,'' explained the  company to the prefecture.    The prefecture, which had attracted the company, was  devastated by the cancellation of construction plans. But the  Hiroshima company Mazda, which uses Shin Kobe's products,  suffered a rapid downturn due to the declining demand for  automobiles. There is nothing to be done to relieve the sorry  plight of companies which rely on Mazda.    The problem is not only with Shin Kobe. Last year two other  companies gave up on technopolis plans. Automotive seat belt  manufacturer Takata had acquired land in the prefecturally  operated Taguchi Industrial Park and Daiure, a processor of  urethane for automotive seats, had planned to build a plant in  the prefecturally operated Chiyoda Industrial Park. Both  companies returned the land to the prefecture. Both were hurt by  the recession in the automotive industry.    Hiroshima Prefecture has many automotive parts manufacturers  and subcontractors to large-scale heavy industries such as  ship-building and steel. One purpose of getting the technopolis  designation from MITI was to lessen the prefecture's reliance on  existing industries -- such as automobiles, ship-building, and  steel -- by encouraging location of high-tech industries such as  electronics and machinery in the technopolis. There were some  positive results. The national brewing laboratory and  Matsushita's research laboratory were lured to the technopolis.  But mostly companies in the automotive industry wanted to enter  the technopolis during the bubble era. As a result, there was  insufficient industrial diversification. That's one reason the  current recession has hurt very badly.    Hiroshima and Hamamatsu are in the top three of the 26  technopolises in terms of value of manufactured goods shipped.  They were blessed from the outset with a concentration of  industries such as autos and instruments, moreover they have big  cities nearby. It is noteworthy that companies are giving up  even in these two regions. There are many regions with worse  conditions that cannot even attract industry.    ``In 1984, on the occasion of the moving of Akita Airport,  three industrial parks were created,'' according to Akita  Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. ``The good economy  continued and companies were locating as expected. Last year was  the worst. Not one company was attracted to the technopolis. The  severe conditions are continuing this year.''    ``We are working hard to attract companies with inspection  tours and explanatory meetings, but we get a very bad feeling  from the corporate side. Last year we attracted eight companies,  but this year we're stuck at one,'' according to Yamaguchi  Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section. The majority of  technopolises are having varying degrees of difficulty in  attracting companies due to the sluggish economy.    Introductory Pamphlets are Virtually Indistinguishable:  ``Electronics, Biotech, New Materials ...''    A diagram (see below) of the changes in number of corporate  locations in the technopolis areas which make up more than ten  percent of Japan's newly established factory locations, shows  that in 1990, driven by the bubble economy, there was a record  of 474 new sitings in those 20 earlier regions designated from  1984 to 1986. This is more than twice the number in 1981.    However, since 1991 the downturn in the economy has been  accompanied by reconsideration of plans for excessive investment  in plant and equipment. The number of new locations has dropped  35% in the two years since 1991, falling to 307 cases in  1992.  Corporate appetites for investment in plants and equipment are  expected to decline further this year.    ``If industrial parks are filled up, that's a kind of  business success. But the technopolises were based originally on  the ideal of Silicon Valley. Despite that, they've become  something very different from nurturers of new industries. There  is a need to reconsider how technopolises differ from industrial  parks.'' This is at the heart of the problem, according to Ichio  Hiramoto, assistant division chief of the social welfare  division of Mitsubishi Research Institute. As an urban  development specialist, Hiramoto has experience with drafting  plans for large scale development projects such as the  technopolises.    The content of introductory pamphlets for the various  technopolises are virtually indistinguishable, particularly in  the fields that they want to develop. They have sweeping goals  in electronics, software, biotechnology, new materials and so  on. It's almost as if their goals were cut by cookie cutter.  There are very few prefectures with the individuality to say  ``if we don't go into that area, we'll lag behind in research in  that field.''    Yamagata Prefecture Achieves Success With Research Focus,  ``Make a Distinctive Plan that Doesn't Follow the System''    Of course, there are also individualistic approaches.  Yamagata Prefecture decisively narrowed the target for its  research and development, thus overcoming its geographical  handicap.    Life support technologies, such as the development of an  artificial heart and prevention of aging, are the pride of  Yamagata. Yamagata ``aims to be second to none in Japan'' in  research related to living bioradicals such as active oxygen  which is said to be closely related to damage to living  organisms from causes such as cancer and aging, according to  Yamagata Prefecture's Industrial Promotion Section.    In November 1988 a life support technology research and  development organization was set up as a voluntary organization.  It has become a cooperative development project involving 70  companies and 120 university researchers. A Bioradical  Laboratory was built as the core facility with 4.5 billion  raised by the prefecture. The laboratory drew Fumio Inaba,  professor emeritus of Tohoku Institute of Technology from  neighboring Miyagi Prefecture and began a public-private jointly  funded Bio Light Information Laboratory.    It was possible to attract personnel due to good narrowing  of  the research goal and legwork. Yamagata succeeded in creating a  somewhat different kind of attractiveness with its living body  radical research.    ``A prefecture like ours (with poor geographic conditions)  couldn't survive if we did the same thing as everyone else. It  is important to create a distinctive plan for a local area  rather than to be lead by the national system,'' says the  Industrial Promotion Section persuasively.    There are examples of other local governments where several  tens of pre-existing researchers have been collected in a  foundation or in the tertiary sector to create unique  cooperative research between corporations and local universities.    There are many cases in which practical research results  have  been achieved. For example: Kumamoto Prefecture's apparatus  using optical sensors for non-destructive continuous sweetness  testing of mandarin oranges and the Shin Niigata-Nagaoka  technopolis' sub-micron super accurate CNC lathe.    However, unfortunately the technopolises cannot be compared  to America's Silicon Valley, which gave birth to many companies  like Intel that will bring forth a new generation and which has  become a world-wide mecca for the computer industry.    Designated Regions With Inflated Egos, Development From  Perspective of a Single Unit of a Bloc is Indispensable    Why have 26 locations spawned such similar plans?    In 1984, the year after the establishment of the Technopolis  Law, MITI began approving development plans based on prefectural  applications. This is what MITI officials familiar with the  circumstances back then say.    At the project stage the technopolis was distorted into  something completely different from the original concept. MITI  meant to select two to three sites from across the country in a  strict selection process and create very pure research parks  which would serve as national models. However, at the  application stage there were many prefectures which said that if  other prefectures did it, then they wanted to do it. Then the  local Diet members got involved. As a result, 26 locations were  designated representing more than half of the prefectures. For  the Diet members the technopolises were a way of extending the  public works budget for highways and maintenance. Most local  governments used the technopolises for ``good causes'' and ended  up with plans very different from the original intention.  Regional egos and the machinations of politicians have warped  the concept of the technopolis.    MITI itself does not control the budget for developing the  technopolises. The localities have been chartered by MITI to be  in charge of the benefits of public works. Another problem is  inadequate control by MITI which designated 26 regions even  though that contradicted its purposes.    This is not just a problem with the technopolises. It's also  a problem since then with MITI's Key Facilities Siting Law and  its Regional Core Cities Law. Twenty-three locations have been  designated under the Key Facilities Siting Law and 44 (almost  all of the prefectures) for the Regional Core Cities Law. ``Most  of Japan's model development undertakings are influenced by  various dynamics during the implementation stage and tend to get  uniformly watered down across the country,'' says Mitsubishi  Research Institute assistant division chief Hiramoto. The  technopolises reproduce the problems of Japan's administrative  organization on a smaller scale.    The fact of 26 designated regions cannot be changed. ``The  topic for debate is how to deal with role allocation and mutual  cooperation among the 26 regions. It's necessary to think about  how to use limited manpower and funds efficiently. For this  purpose it's necessary to overcome the existing prefectural  framework to think of development from a perspective as one unit  of a bloc,'' says Yoshikazu Iwasaki, chief researcher of the  research division of Japan Industrial Location Center which  deals with research and drafting of development plans.    For example, the seven prefectures of Kyushu and Tohoku's  six  prefectures have each received a technopolis designation. It's  natural that they'll compete in attracting companies to the  region.    In Kyushu at the end of the first phase of the technopolis  plan in 1990, Kumamoto, which had quickly succeeded in  establishing an image as the mecca for the semiconductor and  related[?rinkuu?] industries, achieved 98.9% of its goal  for  industrial shipments whereas on the opposite shore Nagasaki  contented itself with 69.9%.    Nagasaki Prefecture has little flat land and limited  resources, so it would be difficult to locate there industries  such as semiconductors which require large quantities of water.  Prefectural per capita income languishes at forty-fourth among  the prefectures. A major cause of problems has been the reliance  of the local economy on shipbuilding. ``In reality Nagasaki is  equipped with highways and an airport, so in terms of access it  compares favorably, but it has a poor image compared to Kumamoto  and Fukuoka,'' according to Nagasaki Prefecture's Industrial  Promotion Section.    Nagasaki Prefecture appears poised to begin capitalizing on  its shipbuilding skills by fostering local companies in the area  of machine processing and on its long coastline by developing  marine environmental protection technology and ocean bottom  exploration technology.    However, this approach won't work unless it collaborates  with  the neighboring prefectures. If Kyushu's prefectures can  cooperate to attract industries suited to their technical  specialties and geographic characteristics, then development  will occur in a balanced way across Kyushu and companies will  see the advantages of locating in Kyushu.    Corporations Also Need to Change Their Thinking and Move  Toward Research Exchange Unhampered by Company-First-Ism    In the beginning there was no industry clustered in the  U.S.'  Silicon Valley. Stanford University, a second-tier university,  played a role when an industrial park was built near the  university. That was the beginning of Silicon Valley. Now about  2,000 companies have their headquarters in Silicon Valley which  has become a research park whose researchers spin off start-ups  and nurture them into full-blown companies.    ``The biggest difference from Japan is the existence of  ``software programs'' for nurturing promising companies.  Innovation won't come from splendid buildings built from a  public works mentality,'' according to Mitsubishi Research  Institute's Hiramoto.    In Silicon Valley, university researchers may turn into  entrepreneurs the next day and personnel move frequently between  companies. Rather than start off with a building and an  organization, they pull together the people and organization  most suited to fostering development. This is how Silicon Valley  supports creativity.    In Japan, by comparison, even when companies cluster  together  they're separated by company-first-ism. There's little exchange  of research and little technological impact on local companies.  ``There are forums set up by local governments or foundations,  but they are generally little more than social gatherings.  Research exchange across corporate boundaries won't happen just  because people dance the bon odori together,'' said the head of  a laboratory located in a technopolis.    To turn the technopolises into something substantial, it  isn't enough to simply address administrative problems. Change  must be made to corporate research customs and to the  characteristics that make Japanese poor at exchanges.              Figure                  Figure         "

It is also believed to have offered to indemnify the Belgians against legal action from Dounreay for breach of contract. In order to allow the speedy import of the spent fuel into the US, the US Energy Department has waived the rule requiring an environmental impact study to be carried out before it can be imported. The Dounreay plant, where the experimental fast-breeder reactor is due to close next year, is concerned that the US could make similar moves with other consignments of spent nuclear fuel in Europe, wiping out Dounreay's reprocessing business. It hopes to win a contract to reprocess a further 500 rods from Belgium, giving it a total of Pounds 15m-worth of business. It now fears it might have to close the reprocessing plant with the loss of 40 jobs. The Clinton administration opposes reprocessing because it increases the stock of weapons-grade uranium. The Studiekentrum voor Kernenergie, which operates the BR2 reactor at Moll in Belgium, is close to deciding whether to accept the US offer, which is understood to involve a price of about Dollars 4,000 (Pounds 2,700) per rod compared with the Dollars 20,000 cost of reprocessing it.

0,FT933-15124 ,"FT933-15124 _AN-DGKANABQFT 930710   FT  10 JUL 93 / Nadir deceived PPI auditors      By ANDREW JACK   MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, illegally deceived the auditors to Polly Peck International about his interest in a Turkish bank and failed to disclose his holding in the 1989 PPI accounts. The 1988 accounts of PPI show that Mr Nadir had an interest in both Impexbank, based in Istanbul, and the Industrial Bank of Cyprus (IBK). The 1989 accounts refer only to IBK. Mr Nadir continued to hold Impexbank shares  -allegedly bought with Polly Peck money - until he sold his interest in 1991. He deceived the auditors, Stoy Hayward, by stating categorically that he did not hold shares in Impexbank, in contravention of the 1985 Companies Act. The act requires disclosure of any transactions related to directors of a company and makes deceiving the auditors an offence. Impexbank was used to channel at least Pounds 158m of the Pounds 371m Mr Nadir allegedly removed from PPI between 1987 and 1990. The details are contained in a letter from Mr Nadir to his auditors and believed to be in the possession of the Serious Fraud Office. In response to a specific request from a senior audit partner, Mr Nadir signed a letter on PPI notepaper in April 1990 - six months before PPI went into administration - stating that he had no beneficial interest in the shares of Impexbank during 1989. He also said he had no beneficial interest in the shares of AN Graphics, the Turkish printing and publishing company that has stakes in many of the PPI Turkish businesses. Mr Nadir attempted to gain control of AN Graphics shares just four days before PPI went into administration. Last week PPI administrators won a ruling in the Manx courts that the transfer of shares from Voyager, a PPI subsidiary, to Mr Nadir was illegal. The shares were apparently transferred in exchange Pounds 8m from Mr Nadir, which the administrators say was never received by PPI.   Companies:-  Polly Peck International.     Impexbank.

Of 98 companies which responded to the survey, 25 said they had abandoned collective bargaining in one or more areas of the company but only 10 had abandoned collective bargaining for all workers. Fifteen cited performance pay as the main motive for abandoning collective bargaining, 12 said collective bargaining was no longer relevant for the employees concerned, and 10 said there was already a low degree of union membership among the people involved. Asked to rate the success of de-recognition in terms of its impact on such things as employee commitment and productivity most said it had been 'fairly successful' a few 'very successful' and very few 'fairly unsuccessful'. De-recognised unions often kept some form of representative or consultative rights, especially over disciplinary and grievance procedures. Sixteen organisations claimed to have introduced personal contracts, but these appeared to vary little within individual organisations. The highest levels of sickness absence from work in spring 1993 were recorded in Yorkshire and Humberside, the latest Labour Force Survey says. Four per cent of men and 6.1 per cent of women were absent because of illness or injury for at least one day in the week during which the data was collected. In all regions - except East Anglia, which had the lowest rate of sick leave  -the levels of sickness absence for women were higher. Overall, 4.2 per cent of men were absent for at least one day in the week of the survey compared with 5.4 per cent of women.

Vice Governor Wei  Minxue presided over the meeting. Governor Gao Yan made a  report entitled ""Fulfilling All Tasks on This Year's Industrial  Economy."" (Zhu Tao), deputy secretary general of the State  Economic and Trade Commission, made a speech in which he called  for efforts to launch the activities among all enterprises in  the country.    This meeting was devoted to extensively mobilizing all  enterprises in the province to profoundly launch the activities  of transforming mechanisms, strengthening management, tapping  potential, and improving efficiency, which should be combined  with all items of this year's industrial work. The purpose of  the activities is to guide all enterprises to voluntarily  transform operational mechanism around the establishment of the  modern enterprise system, to consciously strengthen and improve  management and operation, to promote technological progress, to  comprehensively improve the quality and economic efficiency, and  to enhance the adaptability to the market and the abilities to  copy with changes and participate in market competition in order  to effect a sustained, rapid, and sound development of the  province's economy under the new situation of comprehensively  deepening reform and opening even wider to the outside world.    Governor Gao Yan offered four opinions on the basic tasks of  this meeting and on the realization of the objective of pushing  the economy onto a new height this year. 1) The opinion on the  current economic situation of the province; 2) launching the  activities of transforming mechanisms, strengthening management,  tapping potential, and improving efficiency by regarding it as  the major task of this year's industrial economy; 3) going all  out to organize well the industrial production in the second  quarter; and 4) strengthening leadership and paying attention to  implementation.    Governor Gao Yan stressed: Transforming mechanisms,  strengthening management, tapping potential, and improving  efficiency are interrelated. The transformation of mechanisms  is the foundation for establishing the modern enterprise system.  Only by transforming mechanisms can enterprises turn the  pressures from the market into the internal motivation to  strengthen management, promote technological progress, and  improve the expertise of laborers and economic efficiency.  [Words indistinct] launching the activities is an important  part to establish the modern enterprise system and is a useful  exploration to guide enterprise work under the new situation.  The launching of the activities is of great immediate and  strategic significance in promoting the province's reform,  opening up, and economic development, in maintaining the  province's social stability, and in building a developed border  near-the-sea province.    The meeting also pointed out the goal of the activities as  follows: Autonomy should be put in place among the 428 large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, that are covered by  the three-year plan, and the inventory and check of the  stockpiles and capital of these enterprises should be completed.  State enterprises should begin to carry out the program of  making their management embark on a new height in three years,  and a good foundation should be laid. Among state-owned  enterprises, the enterprises with advanced management should  account for 20 percent, the enterprises up to standard in  management should account for 50 percent, and the enterprises  under standard in management should account for 30 percent or  lower. Most enterprises should establish the policymaking,  information, development, and other management systems and  should enhance their abilities to overcome unfavorable factors,  to keep breast of the changes in markets, and to restrict  themselves. The profit- and tax-yielding rate of the capital of  the industrial enterprises exercising independent accounting  should be raised by 2 percentage points. The per capita labor  productivity of these enterprises should be raised by 14  percent, the comprehensive energy consumption for each 10,000  yuan of output value should drop by 3 percent, the turnover of  the funds retained from their profits should be accelerated, and  the marketing rate of their products should reach 97 percent.  The range of unprofitable industrial enterprises covered by the  budget should drop by 5 percentage points, and the amount of  deficits should decrease by 10 percent.     "
0,FT933-15977 ,"FT933-15977 _AN-DGFC3AFRFT 930706   FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Amic, Daewoo establish white goods joint venture      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   ANGLO AMERICAN Industrial Corporation (Amic) of South Africa and the South Korean Daewoo group have established a 50-50 joint venture to manufacture high-value consumer goods and exploit international technology markets. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman of Amic, the industrial arm of the Anglo American group, said the deal with Daewoo was part of Amic's strategy to reduce its dependence on cyclical commodity markets. The alliance with an Asian partner is an important one for Anglo, which has traditionally found its partners in Europe. Daewoo-Amic, the new company, will make an initial investment of about R20m (Dollars 6m) to take a 29.99 per cent stake in Gentech, a company that manufactures and distributes household electrical appliances. The basis for the venture includes growth potential in the southern African white goods market and Daewoo's extensive technology base and exposure to consumer durables. The establishment by the new company of a local colour picture tube (CPT) manufacturing facility for televisions is also being considered. Giving the reasons for the Daewoo tie-up, Mr Boyd said Amic needed Daewoo's specific technology and international marketing skills to establish itself 'boldly in downstream consumer industries'. Daewoo saw South Africa as a developing consumer market, and needed Anglo's financial partnership and operating skills. South African companies suffered during the sanctions era from the lack of transfer of technology. Anglo often said it was seeking joint venture partners. Part of Amic's reason for seeking a Korean partner was the idea that Korean investors were more willing to accept the risks of the South African environment than US, Japanese or European investors. Korea is also felt to be better attuned to the needs of developing countries, particularly regarding how to use labour-intensive manufacturing methods without sacrificing international competitiveness. Altech, Amic's electronics associate, has a tie-up with the French group, Alcatel, while Samcor, the motor manufacturer in which Amic has a 19 per cent stake, has close ties with Ford.

Thanks largely to cost-cutting and currency gains profits before exceptionals are expected to have doubled to between Pounds 270m and Pounds 300m. Analysts' estimates for 1993 are in a tight range and attention will focus on the company's comments about the state of its major markets. It is expected to be quite positive about the US and UK but to report that continental Europe remains very tough both in terms of volumes and prices. Even if German interest rate cuts continue few observers expect much recovery this year and a stronger pound would make ICI's life more difficult. The recent failure of European manufacturers to agree on a restructuring of ethylene production underlined the deep-rooted problems of an industry dogged by overcapacity. Analysts will be expecting an update on ICI's own restructuring programme, which has meant hefty rationalisation costs over the past three years. In 1992 the combined group reported a loss of Pounds 384m after exceptionals of Pounds 949m. There are expected to have been further provisions last year including a Pounds 100m charge associated with the proposed disposal of its American composite materials business and Pounds 30m for the closure of Electrochlor, its indirectly owned PVC manufacturer in Argentina. Analyst Ian John at NatWest Securities predicts FRS3 pre-tax profits of Pounds 107m after exceptionals. Analysts have been downgrading their forecasts for the current year and, unless ICI is more bullish than expected, most are likely to maintain their view that the shares are now discounting its medium-term recovery potential. The City is expecting unchanged dividends of 27.5p compared with underlying earnings of about 22.5p.   Companies:-  Imperial Chemical Industries.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Accountants KPMG Peat Marwick developed the system in conjunction with the Manchester hospitals and hopes to sell it to other NHS trusts that want to break away from the centralised pay and grading structure. The Manchester trust employs about 6,000 people and has more than 450 types of job. The new computerised evaluation system is highly complex because each department has very different skill requirements for apparently identical job titles. The system will form the basis of a single pay spine for all the trust's medical and non-medical staff. A progress report by Industrial Relations Services, the research group, says that the Manchester trust has not yet moved to local bargaining for basic pay and conditions. The trust has, however, created 'single-table' bargaining for its 22 staff organisations on non-pay matters discussed at local level. These are for grievance procedures, which are covered by deals replacing NHS agreements. Mr Richard Sugden, trust personnel director, says that the success of the trust will largely depend on how well it manages its pay bill, which accounts for 70 per cent of costs.

The government has disregarded the trade unions' earlier  readiness to share the burden of problems, said Schulte. ""Now  is the time for the strong to carry more than the weak, now is  the time to finance out of the coffers what has too long been  financed out of the pockets of employees,"" he said. ""The social  sphere cannot be cut any further.""    Schulte criticized the Social Democratic Party of Germany's  [SPD] announcement that it would investigate all social  benefits. ""I doubt whether it is a good idea for the SPD to seek  agreement with the community of employers. After all, the SPD  needs the votes of employees,"" he said. He warned the Christian  Democratic Union against letting itself be dragged into a  maelstrom of radical market forces.    Schulte reiterated his call for new rules governing the  management of assets in the eastern laender and for a  reconstruction program for that part of the country. He  demanded an investment program involving economic growth and  increased employment, and priority for public and private  investments. A coordinated state industrial and scientific  policy is a prerequisite for an ecological and economic renewal  of the industrial society, he said.    ""To reduce mass unemployment, which the trade unions still  consider to be the cancerous tumor of a modern industrial  society, it is essential to wage an educational campaign to  improve the qualifications of workers and to share available  jobs by shortening working hours,"" said Schulte. ""Part-time  work only stands a chance of success if a return to full-time  work is possible and pensions are guaranteed.""    Schulte countered the corporate concepts of lean production  and lean management [preceding five words in English] with a  call for greater voting rights by employees at all levels.  ""Employees should have greater rights to reach decisions  concerning working time and conditions,"" said Schulte.     "

The sabotage of high-tension pylons by leftist guerrillas who call themselves,  ironically, the Shining Path is plunging Peruvians into darkness and cutting  dangerously into the nation's industrial output.    Power rationing has become a daily headache for millions of people in Lima and  other major cities that depend on hydroelectric power that is brought over the  Andes.    Lima has a new sound -- the almost constant hum of thousands of portable  gasoline generators.    Its streets are in almost constant gridlock because traffic lights are out.  Restaurants and house wives complain of food spoiling because refrigerators  aren't working.    Landlords are slashing rents for the upper floors of high-rise apartment  buildings to entice renters worried about climbing the stairs when elevators  stop.    Since July 28, 1980, when the first high-tension pylon was blown up in the  mountains near Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima -- as President Fernando  Belaunde Terry was giving his state-of-the-union address -- 1,205 towers have  fallen, according to the state power company Electroperu.    A total of 335 were felled last year alone and more than 100 have been toppled  since municipal elections in November, when the rebels blew up 80 in one week  in an effort -- largely unsuccessful, as it turned out -- to disrupt the  voting.    The rainy season that lasts from January to May in the Highlands is making it  difficult for repair crews to reach toppled towers, and Electroperu says it  does not know how long power rationing, which began in mid-November, will  continue.    ""The whole system is a shambles,"" said Jose Dibos of the National Industrial  Society. ""We are running into an almost continuous situation where power  outages have to be accepted as a way of life.""    The Shining Path took up arms in 1980 to bring down Peru's elected government  and install a peasant-worker state patterned on the ideas of Mao Tse-tung of  China.    The government said more than 17,500 people have died in the violence and  economic costs have surpassed $15 billion.    Damage to the electrical system has cost the country more than $600 million,  including repairs and lost electrical output, according to Electroperu. The  company said it costs about $20,000 to replace a tower.    The Industrial Society's Dibos said the electric company has been able to  maintain a ""precarious balance"" only because industries are operating at 50% of  capacity due to the country's economic problems, which included 2,775%  inflation last year and a 12% drop in the gross domestic product.    But he said the damaged power grid is a ""time bomb"" that is costing industry  millions of dollars in lost production and ruined materials and equipment.    One of the hardest hit areas is the glass industry, whose ovens need a  continuous supply of power to allow for the slow heating and cooling required  to make glass.    The Industrial Society said glass production has dropped by half.    ""It's almost impossible for an industrial user to predict when he is going to  get power and for how long,"" Dibos said.    Most of the power supplied to Lima, where a third of Peru's 22 million people  live, comes from Electroperu's hydroelectric dam on the Mantaro River in a  mountain valley 165 miles east of Lima.    Three interconnected lines carry power over the Andes to the coast, each  passing through guerrilla country. One of the three has been down since 1987,  when Electroperu withdrew its repair crews after guerrillas burned 10 company  trucks and threatened to kill workers if they returned.    An Electroperu spokesman, Jose Acevedo, said repair crews on the other two  lines know they are being watched.    ""They watch them from a distance, and as soon as they finish raising a tower,  the terrorists come in and blow up another one,"" he said.

The Anglo American-owned chemicals producer reported a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to R347m (Dollars 102m) in the year to December 31 against R270m in 1992. Turnover climbed to R5.97bn from R5.55bn, including exports worth R649m against R643m, to leave the operating margin unchanged at 8 per cent. Although operating profit improved to R467m compared with R432m, the figure is still below levels five years ago. Financing costs benefited from lower domestic and overseas interests rates and fell to R120m from R162m. The group's extensive capital programmes and higher working capital needs pushed net borrowings R116m higher to R858m by the year-end. A R75m expansion project at subsidiary SA Nylon Spinners was completed in the year, while spending accelerated on the the group's R270m joint venture with the Industrial Development Corporation to make lysine, an ingredient in poultry and pig feed. AECI is committed to new joint ventures with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) - which has swapped its 25 per cent holding in the group for a 51 per cent interest in AECI's explosives business - and Sasol in a R400m project to merge the groups' upstream and downstream petrochemical operations. However, earnings growth at AECI remains hobbled by its 25 per cent stake in loss-making Soda Ash Botswana, plagued by operating difficulties and a slump in local demand for soda ash and strong overseas competition. AECI suffered a R12m investment loss and is considering making a provision of about R140m for present and future investment in the project which will be set off against proceeds from the deal with ICI. Attributable earnings, lifted by a R31m one-off tax credit, climbed to R237m from R164m, equivalent to 153 cents a share against 106 cents. Total dividend is unchanged at 58 cents.

'We will buy the fuel in Britain if we can,' said Mr James Hann, chairman of Scottish Nuclear. 'But if we cannot get it at a reasonable price we will go overseas.' Although BNF is the world's only AGR fuel supplier, Scottish Nuclear is investigating the possibility of financing the creation of AGR fuel production facilities at the foreign companies. It is understood to have made informal approaches to companies in the US, Japan and France. BNF and Scottish Nuclear agreed in principle early last year on fuel supplies and the reprocessing of spent fuel covering the next 15 years. In a big departure from established practice in the UK nuclear industry, it was agreed that Scottish Nuclear could store its spent fuel on its sites in dry stores instead of sending it for reprocessing to BNF's Pounds 5bn Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) at Sellafield in Cumbria. Scottish Nuclear recently gave evidence to a planning inquiry into its application to build a dry store at Torness, Lothian, and will soon apply to build one at Hunterston, Ayrshire. Scottish Nuclear's decision to cut the amount of fuel it sends for reprocessing was a serious blow to BNF. Scottish Nuclear is stepping up pressure on BNF as part of a drive to reduce its Pounds 400m annual operating costs by about a quarter over the next three years. Its agreements in principle with BNF, which cover contracts worth about Pounds 2.7bn, have not been signed. Scottish Nuclear made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 14m in 1991-92 and expects to double that in the year to March 31. Although there is no nuclear levy in Scotland, it sells its power to Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric on long-term contracts at above the market price for electricity.

The deal involves one Y500 share in the private Mitsui Pharmaceuticals being swapped for 10 Toyama Chemical shares of Y50 par value. The merged company, to be formed on October 1, will be capitalised at Y18bn (Dollars 162.6m). While the new company is supposed to be owned equally by Toyama Chemical and Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, the merger is essentially a takeover by Mitsui group companies. Mitsui Toatsu, a chemicals company with an 80 per cent stake in Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, will have a 23 per cent stake in the new company. The deal shows the influence of keiretsu, or corporate families, in Japan. It was arranged by Sakura Bank, the core institution of the Mitsui group, which had a 4.9 per cent stake in Toyama, a common level of shareholding for a main bank in Japan. Toyama, strong in antibiotics, has struggled in an increasingly competitive Japanese market, and reported a pre-tax loss of Y6.3bn in the year to the end of November 1991, though it made a profit of Y3.6bn last year after a recovery in sales. The Japanese government is gradually lowering drug prices under a national health insurance scheme, putting pressure on the industry to restructure. Meanwhile, the Mitsui group has been attempting to build a pharmaceuticals operation comparable to the large companies run by the Sumitomo and Mitsubishi keiretsu groups. Sales at Mitsui Pharmaceuticals last year were Y20.8bn, less than half those of Toyama Chemical, and well below the Y422bn last year at Mitsui Toatsu, which has a broader based business including industrial chemicals and plastics. Before October 1, Mitsui Pharmaceuticals will issue 3m new shares to facilitate the swap. The two companies have already made their first profit forecast, suggesting sales in the year to end-March 1994 will be Y60.5bn, rising to Y75bn in the following year, while pre-tax profit will rise from Y4.5bn to Y5.5bn over the same period.

It is now clear that plutonium would be produced at Thorp in quantities far exceeding the capacity or the willingness of electrical utilities to consume it (Letters November 8, 11 and 15). No matter] BNFL continues to press the government for permission to operate Thorp, arguing it can make a profit by holding utilities to reprocessing contracts negotiated at a time when uranium seemed to be scarce and plutonium the only way to keep electricity-generating reactors running. Now that non-weapons-usable uranium fuel is clearly in ample supply, is there no way to avoid switching on Thorp and compounding the plutonium danger? Britain's prime minister, John Major, can still opt for prudence and sanity. Instead of turning on Thorp's plutonium spigot and hoping for the best, he can engage in some enlightened market testing. At Sellafield, there are already more than 30 tons of plutonium extracted from the spent fuel of reactors operated by British nuclear utilities. Since these reactors are not technically suited for recycling plutonium, why not offer it to BNFL's utility customers in Japan and Germany to test the true demand for plutonium before reaching a decision on Thorp? At this point, they seem to support the start-up of Thorp so long as the resulting plutonium and radioactive wastes remain in Britain. The likely result of market testing will be no demand for plutonium in commercial power reactors (they run on uranium), very little demand for plutonium in RD activities, and a very large demand (and large fees) for continued storage of spent fuel at Thorp until permanent repositories can be opened to dispose of the unreprocessed fuel in the countries of origin.

Along with being useful for fixation and  recovery of atmospheric CO[.sup]2[/], which is a cause of  global warming, this also has applications in systems for  converting hydrogen into methanol and transporting it.    The gold catalyst experiment was carried out by Masaki  Haruta, the head, and Hiroaki Sakurai, a researcher, of the  Catalytic Chemistry Laboratory of GIRI, Osaka. When a mixture of  CO[.sup]2[/] and hydrogen gasses under a pressure of 50  atmospheres was passed through iron oxide affixed to gold,  approximately 5% of the CO[.sup]2[/] combined with hydrogen  to form methanol. The gold and iron oxide exhibited the greatest  activity at 250ëC. Copper and zinc oxide is known as a  catalyst for converting CO[.sup]2[/] into methanol, and the  gold catalyst has the same synthesis efficiency as this. In  addition, the copper catalyst exhibits the greatest activity at  a temperature of 300ëC, and at 250ëC, the gold/iron  oxide catalyst is more efficient.    Following this, GIRI, Osaka plans to mix in aluminum oxide,  etc., and make smaller granules of gold to increase the  activity. Conventionally, gold is considered to have poor  chemical activity and not to be useful as a catalyst, but  recently researchers have learned that it converts carbon  monoxide (CO) into C0[.sup]2[/] at a temperature of -70ëC  and can separate out the odorous components of trimethylamine.    Methanol is a basic chemical product that is also raw  material for thermosetting resins, but recently conversion of  hydrogen, which has the danger of exploding, into methanol for  transportation has attracted attention. The ``WE-NET Concept''  proposed by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) is a project for using the solar energy of overseas  deserts to separate water and generate hydrogen and react the  hydrogen with CO[.sup]2[/] to generate methanol for  transportation, and practical research is being started this  year.

The Energy Intensive Users Group, which includes some of the largest companies in the UK, is to see Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, early next week. A spokesman for British Steel, which belongs to the group, said his company wanted to learn more of the government's plans. Members of the electricity pool, the regulated market through which all electricity has to be sold, have decided to write to the Department of Trade and Industry about the reports. Although the DTI stresses that no decisions have been taken, it is believed to be considering a plan to allow ICI to bypass the pool and buy power direct from a generator. This could save it up to 20 per cent on its electricity bills. ICI says that unless it can buy power more cheaply, it may have to shut down its chlorine plant at Runcorn, Merseyside, with the loss of 7,000 jobs. Mrs Margaret Thompson, the pool's chief executive who will be sending the letter, said yesterday that members felt the pool was 'a big and complicated issue', and they wanted to ensure that the DTI understood the implications of making an exemption. The pool's 30 members, representing generators and distributors, are worried that the government could create an unwelcome precedent. They are already under pressure from their customers to match any ICI deal. The pool was established in the late 1980s, before the privatisation of the electricity industry. Prices are set every half-hour throughout the day on the basis of bids placed by power stations. The price paid by the pool includes charges for running the electricity system and ensuring that enough capacity is available to meet peak demands. Power sold through the pool also incurs the nuclear levy, adding about 10 per cent to electricity bills.   Companies:-  Imperial Chemical Industries.     Energy Intensive Users Group (UK).

After five years of foot-dragging by successive US administrations, a draft Department of Energy report has recommended that the US should immediately take back spent nuclear fuel from nine European research reactors, some of which could be forced to shut if they were unable to dispose of some of their used fuel. The US stopped taking back the fuel in 1988. In the view of Europeans, it thus reneged on a decades-old bargain by which the European research reactors agreed to convert from high-enriched uranium, which could be used to make bombs, to low-enriched uranium. If the US were seen not to be keeping its side of the nuclear bargain, that could seriously weaken its efforts to persuade other countries to renew the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is due to be reviewed at an international conference next year. US and European officials say they are confident that remaining objections by some environmentalists - and from the state of South Carolina, where the spent fuel would end up - can be resolved by the end of March under an accelerated procedure to assess the environmental consequences. 'In general, we are feeling very confident that we will be able to initiate the spent fuel acceptance that is proposed in the environmental assessment,' says Mr Charles Head of the US Energy Department. This would allow shipment of up to 448 fuel elements to begin this summer after a five-year gap, relieving the reactor operators' short-term problems. However, a longer-term solution will require the completion of a full environmental impact statement. This is a bureaucratic obstacle course expected to drag on at least until the end of 1995. Meanwhile, some reactor operators are growing increasingly irritated at US unreliability. 'They haven't kept to any time limits,' complains Dr Klaus Singer, director of Denmark's Risoe reactor.

Hazardous waste, ICI's main priority, was cut by 26 per cent from 475,000 tonnes in 1991 to 350,000 tonnes last year. That represents a fall of 48 per cent since 1990. Over the same period non-hazardous waste was cut by 9.7 per cent. Waste production overall has fallen by 14 per cent since 1990. The group aims to reduce wastes by 50 per cent by 1995, using 1990 as a baseline. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said: 'The achievements made to date are impressive and are a credit to the individual skills, determination and enthusiasm of everyone in the group.' The group was nevertheless fined and prosecuted 21 times for environmental incidents, including seven times in the US, four times in continental Europe and five times in the UK. The total number of prosecutions and fines was 26 in 1991 and 30 in 1990. Sir Denys said there was clearly much to be done in this area. ICI restated its emission figures for 1990 and 1991 to exclude water evaporation at a plant in Pakistan and deep well injection in the US. Earlier figures given by the company for all emissions had been 8.627bn tonnes for 1990 (restated at 6.012bn), and 8.31bn tonnes in 1991. Between 1991 and 1992 capital expenditure on environmental measures increased from about Pounds 130m to about Pounds 170m while environmental operating costs rose from about Pounds 180m to about Pounds 170m. Non-hazardous waste disposed on land fell from 1.47bn tonnes in 1991 to 1.468bn last year. Non-hazardous emissions to air dropped from 297,000 tonnes to 280,000 tonnes over the same period. Non-hazardous wastes to water fell from 3.484bn to 3.068bn. Energy consumption fell 12 per cent during 1992 compared with 1990.   Companies:-  Imperial Chemical Industries.

0,FT934-6843 ,"FT934-6843 _AN-DKWCOADJFT 931123   FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp - surplus in dispute      From Mr WILLIAM WALKER   Sir, Mr Yasutaka Moriguchi of the Science and Technology Agency's Atomic Energy Bureau says (Letters, November 15) 'the prospect that Japan will have no surplus of plutonium, including that from Thorp, is strictly maintained'. He cites figures of plutonium supply and demand contained in the Atomic Energy Commission's report of August 1991 on nuclear fuel cycling in Japan. Unfortunately, the demand estimates in this report are no longer regarded as credible inside or outside Japan. They imply that, between 1991 and 2010, 10-20 tonnes of plutonium will be consumed in fast reactors. But the Monju reactor is having teething troubles, and no site has yet been found for the larger Demonstration Fast Breeder Reactor. They imply that close to 10 tonnes will be consumed in the Demonstration Advanced Thermal Reactor, construction of which has not yet begun and for which the utilities have little enthusiasm. And they imply that 50 tonnes of plutonium will be used to fuel conventional thermal reactors, when utilities have serious qualms about the political and operational viability of this programme, and when total consumption to date has been 44 kilograms in fuel assemblies tested in the Mihama and Tsuruga reactors. My assessment (Letters, November 11) that Japanese plutonium surpluses could approach 20 tonnes by the year 2000 and 40 tonnes by 2010 if current reprocessing plans are implemented may therefore be conservative. But if Mr Moriguchi is correct and no Japanese surpluses are in prospect, why did Mr Kaneko (November 8) decide to draw attention to the need to store Japan's plutonium 'for some time' at Sellafield? Do their statements become compatible if a distinction is drawn between Japan's plutonium surplus and the surplus located in Japan, the idea now being to keep the latter to a minimum by holding the former in Britain and France?

(JAIF) (Chairman, Takashi Mukaibo) held in Hiroshima  ended on 15th. During the three-day conference, it became  obvious that Japan and Europe are anxious and the United States  is critical toward commercial use of plutonium. Both Japanese  and European officials involved in nuclear power activities  countered with evidence of inadequate non-proliferation measures  in the U.S. The JAIF emphasized non-proliferation issues  through the meeting which was held at the site where the first  atomic bomb was dropped. The meeting also produced reassurance  of `cooperation' between Japan and Europe in the use of  plutonium, an issue which has become critical with the  achievement of criticality at the prototype `Monju' fast breeder  reactor.    The meeting featured a session on `Nuclear Power Generation  and Plutonium' during which the pros and cons of the commercial  use of plutonium were vigorously debated.    C. E. Paine, a senior staff member of the American Natural  Resources Protection Association stated, `It is a fact that  nuclear bombs can be produced with plutonium generated by  nuclear reactors.' He objected to the separation of plutonium  from spent nuclear fuel by saying, `If plutonium stockpiles  increase, it is difficult for nuclear inspectors to keep up with  their job.'    On the other hand, Atomic Energy Bureau' s Nuclear Fuel  Division Director Yasutaka Moriguchi of the Science and  Technology Agency, criticized the direct disposal of spent fuel  by the U.S. saying, `Plutonium mines will be created.'    Cogema Vice President J. L. Rikoh [phonetic] from France was  obviously displeased with the U.S. Government and said, `If the  U.S. does not like the separation of plutonium, they should stop  exporting uranium.    Belgium nuclear fuel company Cynatom [phonetic]'s Special  Advisor P. Felbeek [phonetic] indicated inadequate U.S.  non-proliferation measures saying, `Japan and Europe are not the  cause for concern. The problem lies in the United States which  lacks definite safety measures for its militarily used  plutonium.' He insisted that the plutonium gained as a result  of dismantling nuclear weapons `should be mixed with uranium  fuel and burned in reactors, from the economic perspective.'    Mitsubishi Materials Vice President Isami Akimoto said,  `there are neither facilities nor personnel left in the U.S.'  even if they wanted to burn the plutonium obtained through  dismantling of nuclear weapons. He also stated, `The  traditional policy of the U.S. for elimination of plutonium for  use in peaceful nuclear power generation has failed.'    In response to these comments, U.S. Nuclear Management  Research Insistute Director P. Rebensol [phonetic] (general  participant), who opposes the use of plutonium by Japan  proposed, It is not necessary to use plutonium if enriched  uranium obtained through dismantling of nuclear weapons is  reserved for later use. However, Tokyo Electric Power Company  Vice President Makoto Ikegame arugued, `Uranium is a buyers'  market. Therefore, it is not necessary to create reserves. It  is not even worth considering such a proposal unless there is  some specific measure planned (after the uranium researve is  used).'    STA' s Moriguchi also opposed the uranium reserve proposal  saying, `It represents short sighted thinking.' Differences in  focus between Japan, where plutonium has a place in their  long-term energy strategy, and the U.S., which is most concerned  with the negative impact of what they consider the immediate  threat of nuclear proliferation, were obvious.    Hiroshima Declaration of Non-Proliferation Treaty    On the 15th, the final day of their annual meeting, the JAIF  adopted the `Hiroshima Declaration' which appeals for the  elimination of nuclear weapons. The declaration included the  statement that `indefinite extension without any general future  perspective on the elimination of nuclear weapons is  problematic' for extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)  . The declaration contrasted with the Japanese Government' s  position in support of indefinite extension of the NPT. It may  have some impact on future discussions of the NPT extension  issue.    During the press conference after the meeting, JAIF Chairman  Takashi Mukaibo said, `Our main objective is to eliminate all  nuclear weapons. We cannot agree to indefinite extension of the  NPT while those who own nuclear weapons do not eliminate them.'    Former Prime Minister Hosokawa supported indefinite  extension  of the NPT at the UN General Session in September 1993. He  obviously tried to eradicate the `groundless suspicion' of Japan  owning nuclear arms. The JAIF reiterated their demand that  nuclear weapon owning countries eliminate them.     "

Overseas customers would be given the option of taking an additional quantity of high-level waste resulting from the reprocessing of fuel in place of bulkier intermediate and low-level waste. Countries with Thorp contracts signed since 1976 are required to take back waste which results from reprocessing. BNFL has made its evidence available to the public following the publication earlier this month of the committee's study on substitution, which was ordered by ministers to help its review of nuclear waste management. The report supports BNFL's claim that the radiological impact on the environment of substitution would be neutral. It says, however, that if BNFL is to be given the option of offering substitution there is a case for a 'small additional quantum of vitrified (glass) waste to be returned over and above that calculated on radiological grounds alone'. BNFL said yesterday that it welcomed the committee's advice to the government and said it should be possible to implement substitution in a way that accommodated the committee's suggestions on additional waste being returned abroad. The government is likely to decide in the next few months, as part of its review of the nuclear industry, whether to allow substitution. It will face strong representations from environmental groups such as Greenpeace which oppose Thorp's operation and the transportation of nuclear waste materials. They will be concerned about the increase in transportation of high-level waste if substitution is implemented and will dispute claims of a neutral effect on the environment. BNFL started commissioning Thorp this year after a long legal battle. It plans to start returning waste to overseas customers around 1998.

No Entry!"":  Even today production facilities here are kept behind seven  seals, and the barbed wire fence and awesome sign are no mere  stage props. But there are no secrets behind these gates.  There is waste ground. The gates are opened only very rarely.  The predecessors of the present plant created a very dangerous  neighborhood here -- a radioactive dump of their own waste, and  what is more, directly on the banks of the Moskva river, as you  can see.    Unidentified man carrying radiation counter:  Right by the gate -- 10 microroentgen... Uh-oh --  132...520...divided by four that is 130.    Varebrus to camera over video of snowy landscape:  Not a negligible quantity. Incidentally, this is not just a  dump. The land belongs to the Kolomna museum. If you dig, you  can find up to 1,300 microroentgen per hour. And on the surface  up to 650. Not everywhere, of course. Just in certain places.  Waste emitting more than 300 microroentgen is subject to burial  at a special facility near Sergiyev Posad. Initially, nothing  was known about this danger, subsequently it was kept secret,  and now, when it would be possible to remove this filth --  uranium, thorium, and radium lie buried under the snow here --  the money has run out. So production managers from the present  polymetal plant have themselves sounded the alarm.    V. Sotskov, deputy director for safety and emergency  situations, identified by caption: The simplest solution  would be if the waste could simply be taken away. But, as I  have already said, it is technically impossible to dig it up, or  cover it up somehow. The bank will be destabilized and the  deposits will slide into the Moskva river.    Varebrus: True, the radioactive substances would  not dissolve in water. But they would accumulate in the silt  and pass into fish. And so there is only one solution -- look  for and find the money necessary to protect our health.

0,FT931-6593 ,"FT931-6593 _AN-DCACUABMFT 930301   FT  01 MAR 93 / Dispute delays Sellafield plans      By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent   TENSION IS rising in government departments over the question of whether British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site will be used to store other countries' radioactive waste for many decades. The Trade and Industry Department received a report from the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee before Christmas saying that Sellafield could be used for long-term waste storage, but the department has so far refused to discuss the implications with the Environment Department. BNF has repeatedly rejected charges that its Sellafield-based Thorp plant for reprocessing nuclear fuels, which has taken nearly 10 years and Pounds 2.8bn to build, would become a 'nuclear dustbin'. It argues that most of its overseas contracts require customers to take back reprocessed waste. The latest tension arises over a BNF 'waste substitution' proposal - which means customers will take back only the 'radiological equivalent of their waste'. Under this proposal large volumes of waste would be left at Sellafield. BNF wants Thorp to start operating soon. Unless the waste substitution plan is implemented, however, this may not happen. Japanese customers, who with German customers account for much of Thorp's order book, have made preparations to take back only a small amount of highly radioactive waste. While some customers have said publicly that they are committed to their contracts with BNF, others are increasingly apprehensive about taking back the reprocessed waste because of the high storage and shipping costs and political sensitivity. Environment Department officials have been refused some details of BNF's customer contracts by the Trade Department on grounds of commercial confidentiality, making an assessment of long-term waste storage at Sellafield more difficult. Before Thorp can start operating it needs authorisation from the Pollution Inspectorate. According to one official the inspectorate is unlikely to submit its recommendation to the Environment Department before May because the decision has become so sensitive that 'we need to be seen to get every dot and comma right'. BNF has claimed that if Thorp does not go ahead the UK will lose Pounds 900m in profit in the next 10 years. Officials are concerned, however, that difficulties over sending reprocessed waste back to customers could undermine those projections.   Companies:-  British Nuclear Fuels.

The Double Challenge: Upheaval in Germany's Industrial  Research Infrastructure--Requirements for Political Action    1. Upheaval in Germany's Industrial Research Infrastructure    Industrial research is an important element for a  competitive, modern industry; it combines knowledge of basic  research with the requirements of industrial production.  Industrial research is therefore an essential part of the  technological innovation capability in the economy.    The industrial research infrastructure in the united Germany  today faces a double challenge:    Challenge 1: Industrial research needs a technical and  functional adjustment to the altered tasks; this is a result of  the progressive technological development and altered dynamic of  the world market, which further reinforce the pressure for  innovation in industry. First, new subject concentrations are  emerging in research and technology, to which the industrial  research establishments and government RD funding measures  must  react. Second, it is becoming clear that industrial research  institutions today, more than before, must be understood as  active intermediaries in networks of various industrial partners  and research establishments, and that in so doing basic research  and application development must cooperate more closely than  before--in local as well as globalized industrial connections.    Challenge 2: Simultaneously, an internal German adjustment  of  capacity and structure is necessary. As a result of the change  in systems, industrial research in the new laender has lost its  customers almost completely and is in total upheaval, and  largely in dissolution as well. The sharp economic decline of  the global economy, which now has also reached western German  industry, further led to reduced utilization of western German  industrial research as well. Despite the already completed  downsizing in eastern Germany, the declining demand is today  faced with a relatively large overall German supply potential  for industrial research that lacks industrial contracts. To this  is added a structural problem: Both research systems contributed  similar strengths and weaknesses; today a heated, cutthroat  competition is under way, in which eastern German suppliers are  clearly finding poorer starting conditions.    In order to assure an overall German industrial landscape  that is aimed at the future, is innovation-oriented and benefits  industrial competitiveness, two urgent tasks must be mastered at  the same time:        -  In the short term: The creation of improved competitive  conditions for the remaining industrial research establishments  in eastern Germany--assuming that an approximately equal  distribution between old and new laender is politically intended.    -  In the medium term: A stocktaking, specific adjustment and  further development of the entire German industrial research  landscape.       The following part of the research report called ""Industrial  Research Establishments in the FRG With Special Consideration of  Structural Adjustments in the New Laender"" is meant as a  contribution to the discussion of requirements for political  action in this field. In the following the outlined discussions  will be shown as having several steps.    The argumentation rests on results of the studies, carried  out jointly by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems Technology  and Innovation Research (ISI) and the Institute for Economic  Research Halle (IWH) in 1991/92 on this subject, which are  documented in the other sections of the research report, and on  assessments of newer results of innovation research.    2. Restructuring of Industrial Research: Elements of New  Political Efforts    A debate on the future of industrial research in Germany  must  take the following aspects into account:        -  Support for research and technology is a long-term  investment and does not help overcome the current economic  crisis.    -  New technological concentrations and the increasing  interlinking of technologies will mark industrial research  services in the future.    -  New functions of technical research and industrial innovation  are developing.    -  Regions need a mix of industrial research at the ""middle""  level  of technology and a ""wide range.""    -  Industrial research in eastern Germany needs preferential  treatment in order to have a chance to adjust to the double  structural change.    -  A stocktaking and specific restructuring of the  entire German industrial research landscape is  necessary.       These aspects can only be briefly commented on in the  following. A systematic analysis and the design of future  structures for industrial research in Germany will require  significantly greater efforts than were possible within the  framework of this underlying study.    Support for Research and Technology Is a Long-Term  Investment and Does not Serve to Overcome the Current Crisis    The discussions outlined here for the support of research  and  technology are not suitable for helping to overcome the double  crisis of the German economy in the early 1990s, which consists  of the basic adjustment crisis of eastern German industry and  the current economic slump in the western German economy.    Strengthening the technological innovation capability of  industry is a permanent task, whose results become effective  only in the medium and long term. Planning horizons for  stabilization, reorganization and expansion of the industrial  research infrastructure must therefore have a perspective of at  least five to ten years. The buildup of the existing  infrastructure in the old laender took place over three decades  before it reached its present size, and the establishments were  able to assume their present functions in the scientific and  industrial innovation system.    For the infrastructure plans for industrial research in the  area of the new laender today this means--after an urgent,  initial guarantee of a minimum potential in the upheaval phase  of 1989/72, as was shown by the fate of many ""research  companies""--that the foreseeable requirements must be the  determining ones at the end of our decade and in transition to  the next millennium. These requirements cannot be exactly  specified in advance, however, partly because the positions of  the German economy in the world market in five years and later  are uncertain, and partly because technological developments  cannot be adequately assessed. However, we can indicate a few  elements in the foreseeable shifts in concentration and altered  function of industrial research in the coming years.    New Technological Concentrations and Their Increasing  Interlinking    In the last few years the question of the potential  development of science and technology is again being discussed  and studied in leading industrial nations, above all in the  United States and in Japan, as well as in Europe and in other  OECD nations. A whole series of studies on evaluating the  so-called critical technology fields for the medium-term future  have now been published. They contain more or less extensive  lists of technologies (for example the Commerce Department of  the United States: ""Emerging Technology: An Appraisal of the  Technical and Economic Possibilities,"" 1990; ""Report of the  National Committee for Critical Technology"" of the United  States, 1991; Ministry of Economics of the Netherlands:  ""Experiment in Technology Forecasting,"" 1991; Economic Planning  Agency, Japan: ""Technology and Products in the Year 2010,"" 1992;  Science and Technology Agency, Japan: ""Future Technology in  Japan,"" 1992). Such studies were produced with the general  objective of being able to concentrate research activities and  government followup measures to those areas of technology, where  a decisive influence on the future problem-solving capability of  the national economies in question is addressed. Such studies  are also under way in Germany at this time (one with medium-term  and one with long-term perspectives), which have not yet been  concluded, however.    What information regarding the innovation process from  medium  and long-term perspectives, and thus for the tasks of industrial  research, can be obtained from such studies, and what  bottlenecks can be perceived? This is, of course a prognostic  and synthetic question, to which there is no ultimate answer,  founded on data.    In general terms, the innovation cycle can be sketched as  that of ""intelligent"" technology. The universally cheap resource  of petroleum in the postwar era is replaced by the universally  cheap resource of the ""chip.""    In the discussion of bottlenecks, greater attention must be  paid to the demand factors. Technology monitoring (and sometimes  also technology policy) is tempted to limit itself to the  description and consideration of the potential supply of natural  science technology solutions and the institutions which offer  them. Which technology and which research infrastructure will be  important in the future depends to a great extent on the  anticipated social, ecological and economic problem pressure,  from which important demands on the science and technology of  the future are formulated.    For the purpose of clear arrangement and description, it is  possible to distinguish those fields of technology, which in all  corresponding foreign studies are regarded as essential for the  future innovation capability (a new assessment by the ISI and  the project sponsor, the Federal Ministry for Research and  Technology [BMFT], undertaken at the request of the BMFT, will  soon appear):        -  Advanced materials,    -  manufacturing and production technologies,    -  information technology and electronics,    -  biotechnology,    -  and, above all, technologies in their respective overlapping  areas, such as microsystem technology, nanotechnology, molecular  electronics.       Technology at the beginning of the 21st Century cannot be  divided according to conventional aspects, however; this applies  particularly to application areas. Applications such as future  telecommunications result from progress in both microelectronics  and photonics and are not conceivable without contributions from  software development. This cooperation by technologies is not  basically new, but is spreading more and more and now requires  consequences for the research, technology and innovation  policies. It must be studied whether the research infrastructure  (including the industrial one) and the existing research  administration in Germany must be adapted to the objectively  existing interlinking.    New Functions of Technological Research and Industrial  Innovation Develop    The OECD recently stressed (as a result of its  ""Technology/Economy Program"") the altered role of industrial  research in the industrialized nations: As an ""intermediary  body,"" it will in the future not only provide the transfer of  knowledge from research to industrial application, but must also  feed back the requirements of industry to basic and  long-term-oriented research. Beyond that, it will have to meet  the--seemingly paradoxical--double challenge of being  increasingly active ""on the spot"" in local technology-oriented  networks as well as cooperate in ""globalized"" technology  development contexts (""techno-globalism""), since the production  of knowledge and innovations more and more frequently takes  place in international connections.    This is the result of a structural change for technological  innovations, which now no longer takes place in ""new"" technology  fields (such as modern biotechnology), but on a broad front, and  to which the industrial and industrially applied research in the  new laender must also submit (see also Box 1). Michael Gibbons  of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) spectacularly called  this supplementation, observed by many innovation researchers,  of the innovation process by a second mode the ""transition from  mode 1 to mode 2 of the knowledge production:"" Mode 1 describes  a more traditional, ""linear,"" discipline-bound, primarily  internal (within a company or research institute) manner of  producing technological innovation through ""applied"" research  and development (which in certain fields will continue to be of  importance); mode 2 describes a new form of science-based  innovation processes, which overcomes the conventional  separation of pure and applied research. Elements of the new  form of science production are:        -  Research in connection with application and application  development with feedback to the research base,    -  production of ""transdisciplinary"" knowledge,    -  heterogeneous form of activities and participating actors,    -  variety of organizational and institutional forms,    -  immediate industrial utilization of the possibilities of new  technical facilities and equipment in research,    -  greater demands for quality and efficiency control.       To begin with, these are very general conclusions, which  need  more precise analysis and specification for individual fields of  technology, research institutions and various industries. It is  certain, however, that a view, organization and promotion of  industrial research that is largely oriented toward traditional  divisions of industrial branches, such as dominates traditional  ""joint industrial research,"" will no longer do justice to the  interconnected character and ""transdisciplinary quality"" of  increasingly science-linked innovation processes.    Box 1: Market Opportunities for Eastern German Industrial  Research: Modern Technological Strategies Necessary.    In a market for industrial research in Germany, which is  overcrowded in some fields and which furthermore is marked by a  decrease in research contracts from the economy and restrained  government support for industrial research, it is particularly  difficult for these establishments and enterprises in the new  laender to become permanently established: In view of the  extremely unfavorable starting conditions (interrupted relations  with former industrial partners, the lack of capital, uncertain  property conditions, obsolete facilities, the danger of losing  qualified personnel) they regard themselves as exposed to a  fierce, cutthroat competition, although in part they are highly  efficient and willing to achieve.    A future-oriented market strategy includes market analyses  and operating systems, sufficient investments and long-term  business strategies, particularly innovation and technology  strategies. It is precisely in these areas that eastern German  enterprises have major shortcomings. Short-term survival  strategies (such as low-price policies) do not create any  prospects. What is decisive is the correct positioning of one's  own work with respect to the demands of technological  innovations in industry--right now these are undergoing a  radical process of change: World-market-capable products from a  high-price economy such as the German (and other western  European ones) will be even more technology-intensive in the  future than in the past. The ""technological intensity"" of the  products today increasingly also includes intelligent  interconnection of technologies of very different origin; at the  same time, more and more often knowledge from basic scientific  research flows directly into the development process for new  products (or methods).    The growing ""interlinking of technology"" and  ""science-basing""  creates new challenges for industrial research and development;  small and medium-sized enterprises, above all, thus end up under  pressure to adjust and are looking for support. Industrial  research establishments can provide help here and thus find a  market, if they meet the following demands:        -  Technological interconnection. Intelligent  products require the combination of the most varied  technologies; industrial research must visibly be able to  practice interface management.    -  Interdisciplinary cooperation. More than before,  representatives of various disciplines in the engineering  sciences, the natural sciences and technology management must be  ready for and capable of cooperating.    -  Network orientation. One enterprise is increasingly  less able to offer all the know-how about technology-intensive  products: Formal and informal cooperation between various  partners (companies, research facilities, engineering bureaus,  etc.) in technology networks becomes more important.    -  Simultaneous regional and global orientation.  Industry-related research needs strong roots in the regional  research and industrial environment, but in the respective field  of expertise it must maintain active connections with leading  worldwide developments, for instance through international  research cooperations.       Regions Need a `Mix' of Industrial Research at the `Middle'  Level of Technology and a `Wide Range.'    The conclusions in the preceding step do not make regional  potentials in industrial research at the ""middle"" technological  level, which are frequently based more on the traditional,  ""linear,"" model, superfluous. Practical experience proves--and  many innovation and regional research studies confirm--that they  continue to form a stabilizing element in modern industrial  structures, whose backbone are active, company-internal RD  potentials.    In the old laender such capacities have been built up over  decades with massive use of public funding from the Federal  Government and the laender; many of these research  establishments today form the foundation for continued  development toward ""science-based"" technological innovations.    Which ""mix"" of industrial research establishments from  various fields of technology and with varying technological  ""range"" is regionally or nationally necessary? It would take a  great deal of expense systematically to compare, quantitatively  and qualitatively, the existing infrastructure of industrial  research in the old laender with the establishments in existence  right now in eastern Germany, in order to draw conclusions for  planning decisions; this expense could not be justified in the  framework of the analyses undertaken for this report.    But just a glance at the industrial research infrastructure  ""mix"" of an old land, which is very active in this respect,  makes it clear how large the gap is that yawns between the  situation there and the conditions in the new laender (see Box  2). The desire to build such an infrastructure from scratch in  each of the eastern German laender would take an extraordinary  effort.    Box 2: Industrial Research in the Old Laender--Example:  Baden-Wuerttemberg    The beginnings of government support for industrial research  in the region of the Land of Baden-Wuerttemberg go back far into  the 19th Century. Today, the land (9.6 million inhabitants)  counts the following among its industrial research  establishments:        -  13 Fraunhofer Society institutes,    -  10 joint industrial research institutes,    -  Eight contract research facilities at universities,    -  Two large research establishments,    -  about 100 transfer establishments of the Steinbeis Foundation  (usually) at technical colleges.       These facilities are financed by research income (contract  research, research funding) and by institutional funding from  the Federal Government and the land (in proportions varying  according to the institution).    The Fraunhofer Society institutes in Baden-Wuerttemberg  (1,500 employees) work in the following fields of work, among  others: Information technology, production automation, biomethod  technology, energy technology, construction technology, sensor  technology, materials. The budget of the Baden-Wuerttemberg  institutes was DM 300 million in 1989, approximately one-third  of which was financed on the basis of industrial cooperations.    Divided by industry, the joint industrial research  establishments operate in the following fields: textile and  process technology, clothing industry, textile chemistry,  chemical fibers, tanning, pigments/paints, industrial glass,  precision mechanics/watch technology, microtechnology, fine  metals/metal chemistry, synthetics. The budget volume for these  establishments was DM 46 million in 1989, DM 14 million of which  were based on industrial cooperations.    The contract research institutes at the universities (""An  institutes""), which have only been around for a few years in  this form, are active in the following sectors:  microelectronics, information science, natural sciences-medical  research, laser technology in medicine, application-oriented  knowledge processing, solar energy and hydrogen research,  manufacturing technology. In 1989 the budget for these  institutes was DM 49 million, DM 18 million of which came from  cooperations with the business sector.    The large research establishments (Stuttgart Research Center  of the Aerospace Research Institute, DLR, in the fields of  materials, construction methods, energetics, and Karlsruhe  Nuclear Research Center, KfK, in the fields of environmental  technology, materials research, handling technology, microsystem  technology, nuclear technology), earned about DM 30 million in  income in 1989 through industrial cooperations (with a total  budget of DM 780 million). In connection with the shrinking  institutional support for these establishments from the federal  government, they will make efforts over the next few years to  expand their share of the contract research market.    The technical advisory services and transfer centers of the  Steinbeis Foundation (founded in 1971), in the which professors  and graduates from technical colleges in the region offer  technological advice and development projects in the fields of  flexible automation and production technology, process  technology, electronics/microelectronics, software engineering  and CAD/CAM, in 1989 earned more than 90 percent of their DM 65  million budget from industrial cooperations.    Industrial Research in Eastern Germany Needs Preferential  Treatment in Order to Have a Chance to Adjust With the Double  Structural Change    The collapse of industrial research in the new laender has  already taken on dramatic proportions. Of the approximately  75,000 researchers active in industry at the beginning of 1990,  at the present time--as reported by representative surveys at  the beginning of October 1992--no more than 15,000 are left in  the new laender. The number of industrial researchers in the new  laender, compared to the old laender, has thus reached a ratio  of 1:15. While in the old laender there are seven researchers  for every 100 industry employees, in the new laender there is  only one. In addition, it must be taken into account that of the  remaining RD employees one in three works in a job creation  position.    So far, it has not been possible to halt the decline of  RD  potentials. An extensive inquiry among privatized research  establishments and privatized enterprises gave the result that,  from the end of 1991 until April 1992, a 25 percent decrease in  RD potential took place, and these companies feared an  additional decrease by mid-1993 by up to 60 percent. In Trust  Agency enterprises, as well, a more rapid drop in RD  employees  than in general employees is taking place, as confirmed by  reports from the Trust Agency itself.    About half of all industrial RD employees in the new  laender  are still working in Trust Agency enterprises. Although the  Trust Agency is trying to enforce preservation of the RD  potential when selling the companies, increasingly more buyers  of industrial enterprises are refusing to take over RD  employees. The number of enterprises which function as ""extended  workbenches"" for their mother companies, is growing.    The present development in industrial research runs counter  to the desirable industrial buildup in the new laender. Where  there is a lack of creative research there is also a lack of  innovation, and where no innovations are being brought out there  will also be little investment. Successful innovations presume  immaterial investments and result in material replacement,  rationalization, and expansion investments. For that reason  RD  must not be regarded as a labor policy task, but as a necessary  investment for the future.    Although basically an original task for the economy, the  federal government and the laender agree that in view of the  extent and the special problems of structural change in the  economy in the new laender, the process of restructuring and  reorganization and expansion of efficient RD potentials  must be  accompanied by subsidies over a longer period through government  measures. In this sense many attempts at economic and technology  policy are being made to promote the innovation capability of  eastern German enterprises. The BMWi [Federal Ministry for  Economics] and the BMFT are making a large amount of funding  available. But it is still not clear whether these subsidies  will also be available in the medium term (three to five years)  as a prerequisite for self-supporting reconstruction in the new  laender.    In the future it will primarily be the laender which must  bear special responsibility in this process. A glance at the  abundance of existing subsidy measures being offered by the  governments in the old laender (see Box 3) makes it clear how  much eastern Germany still needs to catch up, although the  governments in the new laender are apparently becoming active in  this field, as was documented at another place in this study.    A research landscape is soon destroyed. Rebuilding it is  many  times more expensive than keeping it. For this reason it is  proposed        -  that research potentials be supported on site for a  longer, but defined period of time. The research establishments  need fundamental or basic financing (decreasing), since only a  minor part of the overall costs can be financed from project  support;    -  that a gradually decreasing financial subsidy be assumed for  the next three to five years for the enterprises still under  Trust Agency management. Limiting the subsidy to enterprises  with fewer than 1,000 employees is here counterproductive for  maintaining the RD potentials.    -  that the subsidy rate in certain cases be increased to 80  percent for enterprises, which due to their limited financial  opportunities cannot generate the required 50 percent of their  own funding and for that reason cannot claim any subsidies;    -  that equal starting conditions be created for eastern German  industrial, independent, research establishments by conveying  ownership of the movable goods as well as property needed for  the business. In addition, cancellation of old debts and  liquidation loans is indispensable.    -  that the support of contract research from west to east (AWO)  be expanded. Utilization of eastern German industrial research  by companies in the processing industries in the old laender has  been less than satisfactory until now. With exactly DM 50  million (as of August 1992), one can only speak of a beginning  of support in awarding contracts to researchers in the new  laender. Measured by the annual amounts given away by  enterprises in the old laender to external research  establishments, the above amount, at not quite one percent, is  very low;    -  that the equality of eastern German RD facilities in  competing  for the granting of contracts be assured. To that end, more  eastern German scientists should also sit on expert panels.

In  the former GDR industrial research was organized completely  differently, but it also had--something which is crucial  here--comparatively high-quality research resources, above all  in human capital.    Today, more than two years after the German unification, the  all-German industrial research is facing a challenge with  respect to volume: The uncontrolled decline of industrial  production in the new laender is accompanied by a continued  cutback in industrial research in eastern Germany. The sharp  economic slump in the global economy, which has now reached the  western German industry as well, also causes a shrinking demand  for the services of western Germany industrial research.    To this is added a structural problem: A comparison of  technological specialization models in eastern and western  Germany for the year immediately before the unification shows  that both research systems demonstrate similar strengths and  weaknesses, so that there were scarcely any positive  complementary effects. On the contrary; a violent cutthroat  competition began, in which eastern German workers clearly had  the inferior starting conditions.    What could have happened even at the time of the German  unification must take place now: The entire German industrial  research infrastructure should be subjected to a thorough  stocktaking        -  on the demand side, meaning with a view to the  foreseeable (as well as desirable with respect to industrial  policy) industrial demand for research work,    -  on the supply side, meaning with a view to existing and  development-capable potentials,    -  institutionally, meaning with a view to proven or obsolete  financing, organization and cooperation models,  respectively.       Since this has already in part been done as regards the  eastern German infrastructure, this challenge applies  particularly to the western German system. It should be  connected with the attempt to describe the entire German market  for research and development services in terms of quantity as  well (see Box 4).    Several reasons argue in favor of such a revision:        -  Until now there has been no sufficiently detailed, in  terms of quantity and quality, and at the same time clear  picture of the entire German infrastructure of industrial  research, but such an overview represents an indispensable  foundation for planning and decisions in research and innovation  policy.    -  There are accumulating indications that the spending for  research and technology development in Germany is stagnating or  even declining. The public research budgets have grown  disproportionately with the German unification, that is to say,  in relative terms they have shrunk. Research spending by the  economic sector hardly grew in real terms in the last three  years--after high growth rates in the 1980s--and the number of  employed research personnel in the old laender from 1989 to 1991  dropped by 2.9 percent a year (according to the Expert Report on  Economic Statistics 1992). Under these conditions there is also  a stagnation of external RD spending by enterprises--and  hence  the field of action for industrial research.    -  The system of government actors is fragmented; there is a  lack  of coordination between department politics and of a clear  division of duties between regional, national and European  RD  policies.    -  There are scarcely any long-term and strategically designed  guidelines, either in industry or in research and technology  policy.    -  The mobility between the subsystems of the research system  (for  example between industrial research, economic research, academic  operation) and in international connections is insufficient.    -  The politically offered incentive systems are now no longer  sufficiently capable of adjustment or creative; it is felt that  their concepts are no longer specific enough.       In the event the proposed extensive stocktaking of the  business-oriented research system should finally lead to a  reorganization, several factors are unavoidable:        -  A restructuring of industrial research must take place  with a view to the position and opportunities of German industry  in the world market. In so doing, one must balance which  weaknesses in the technological performance profile can  realistically be overcome by the industry and by government  support for industrial research, and which market sectors will  remain unconquerable.    -  The existing industrial structures and industrial  concentrations in eastern and western Germany, insofar as they  are competitive or harbor strong potential for future success,  must be treated as constants in the decision about research  infrastructures.    -  The restructuring must treat German industrial research as a  part of the larger infrastructure of the European Community and  also with a view to Central and Eastern Europe.       It is of basic importance here that the state cannot  ""execute"" this restructuring process but should primarily  moderate and, during recognizable bottlenecks, provide support  through institutional funding for necessary research facilities  and time-limited subsidy programs.    Box 4: Development of the Market for Research and  Development in the Old Laender    An exact description of the market for RD services  creates  difficulties in several respects, which are mentioned elsewhere  (see PROGNOS/ISI: ""RD Cooperations by Small and Medium-Sized  Enterprises, Basel/Karlsruhe, 1991). Including the new laender  makes little sense, since the corresponding data are still  incomplete and the dynamic of negative change continues to be  strong (See Expert Report on Economic Statistics: ""Research and  Development in the Economy, Results and Assessments 1991-92"").    The data available for the old laender show stagnation,  after  impressive growth in research spending in the economy in the  1980s and an absolutely and relatively significant growth in  external research tasks since the beginning of the 1990s. This  is undoubtedly a reflection of the slowdown in economic growth.  Experience in innovation research (""interlocking technologies,""  ""science-linking"") allows for the assumption, however, that the  proportion of external RD spending (about 10 percent)  reached  today will no longer decrease but perhaps might even grow.    More precise analyses here show that the predominant part of  external company spending flows not to government-supported  research infrastructures but to other companies--a clear  indication of the interconnection of industrial technology! As  is well known, the entry into the RD market is made easier  for  government-supported institutions through programs which offer  financial support for cooperation between industry and science.    Under these framework conditions it cannot be anticipated  that eastern German establishments should rapidly be able to  capture, on their own, an appreciable share of the all-German  RD market.

The rate cut for the site in north-west England takes effect next month. It could prompt other large users in England and Wales to seek reductions. Although this would be welcomed by industry as a benefit of privatisation, water companies would make up any shortfall by raising prices elsewhere, including charges to domestic users. Ofwat said ICI approached the regulator about a year ago to discuss tariffs at the site and was followed by several other big users. Gatwick airport negotiated a 25 per cent tariff reduction from East Surrey Water, which came into effect at the start of April. Tariff reductions are not automatic and big users need to show that the costs of supplying them are lower. ICI argued that it was supplied at Runcorn directly from North West Water's trunk mains rather than the more expensive household distribution network. ICI is the UK's largest industrial user of water with annual water bills of more than Pounds 20m. The North West Water agreement will save a 'substantial six-figure sum' each year, the company said. 'If these circumstances apply elsewhere, we will expect similar treatment,' said an official. ICI has been a leading critic of rising utility prices since privatisation. The company is still in discussions with the government about lower electricity prices for its Runcorn site, where its main product is chlorine. The discounts were welcomed by Ofwat as 'correcting imbalances' between water users. In the past, industrial users and owners of large properties have subsidised small domestic users. But the cuts will be attacked by water companies, under pressure to keep prices down yet improve water and sewage quality. Mr David Highet, director of communications at North West Water, warned that the lower charges for big users could mean higher bills for consumers. 'The money has to come from somewhere,' he said.

The radioactive waste management advisory committee's 13th annual report, published yesterday, said that 'disposal of radioactive waste is very unlikely to take place in the repository any earlier than 2010', more than three years after the target date. The vast underground caverns, to be constructed by UK Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste-disposal company, are intended to take up to 2m cubic metres of low- and medium-level waste from the UK's Magnox nuclear reactors and from British Nuclear Fuels' Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield - if the controversial plant is approved. The committee yesterday warned it might be difficult to find 'unequivocal evidence' of the proposed store's environmental safety because of the complexity of the geology and underground water flows near Sellafield. Nirex said yesterday: 'We have set a target that we believe is technically feasible, but it is conditional on factors not under our control, in-cluding ground conditions'. It added: 'We agree that the geological suitability of Sellafield is open to question. That is why we are spending such a lot of time and money investigating it.' Professor John Knill, the committee's chairman, repeated the committee's belief that there were 'no compelling waste management reasons' for a reprocessing plant such as Thorp. He questioned whether BNF's proposed policy of 'radioactive substitution' at Thorp would be environmentally neutral, as BNF claimed. BNF has reached informal agreements with Thorp's foreign customers to store permanently the low and medium-level waste from reprocessing their fuel, but to send back a 'radiological equivalent' of high-level waste. The pact is intended to reduce transportation costs. Prof Knill said: 'The full range of tests to prove that substitution is environmentally neutral has not been carried out - at least, we have asked for these tests but have not seen them.' Because different types of waste had different rates of decay substitution that was neutral at one time might not be at another, he said. BNF said yesterday it regarded substitution as environmentally neutral and had provided the committee with all the data it had requested.   Companies:-  UK Nirex.     British Nuclear Fuels.

This  development is based on the development project entitled ``Super  Environmentally Resistant Advanced Materials'' under MITI's Next  Generation Industrial Basic Technology RD System. It is a  technique for freely deforming and processing intermetallic  compounds, which are notoriously hard to process, into complex  shapes. GIRI, Nagoya, established this technology in a series of  manufacturing steps by first using an injection molding machine  to mold commercial titanium-aluminum powder and then sintering  it in a vacuum furnace. GIRI, Nagoya, plans to develop new  materials in the future with this process.    The Super Environmentally Resistant Advanced Materials  Project is an eight-year project running from 1989 to 1996, and  development proceeds through an industry-academia-government  joint structure. The intermetallic compounds targeted for  development are strong at high temperatures such as  titanium-aluminum (1100C), niobium-aluminum (1800C)  and the like. Their applications are likely to include  aeronautics and space, such as the super plane that is expected  to appear in the 21st Century, new forms of energy, etc. GIRI,  Nagoya, conducted its RD on injection molding and metallurgy  with powders of intermetallic compounds based on the injection  molding process for ceramics that it developed from 1981 through  1988.    This new process consists bringing together commercially  available titanium-aluminum powder, an injection molding machine  used for plastics, and a vacuum furnace. Researchers mixed wax  and resin as binders with the powdered alloy at 150C,  formed pellets, injection molded, removed the binder by  evaporation, and sintered the product in a vacuum furnace.  Injection molding of metal powders has been performed with  stainless steel for use as parts in watches, etc., but this is  the first time it has been accomplished with an intermetallic  compound.    Because the main goal of this project is not development of  new materials, the sample pieces do have good material  properties, but the fact that this manufacturing process enables  titanium-aluminum injection molding is a major step forward.  Researchers plan to continue studies from the standpoint of  material properties by adding strengthening elements, etc., in  the future. The features of this injection molding/sintering  process are that the work environment is good, material losses  are small, complex shapes are possible, etc. It is attracting  attention as a new method to be used in place of precision  casting.

To date, Reliance, which in 1992 became the first Indian company to offer global depositary receipts, has confined its international fund-raising to equity-related issues. Lack of official approval for debt issues was a competitive constraint, Mr Ambani said. 'You cannot ask Indian companies to become global while tying up our arms and legs.' Reliance's dependence on equity funding - net gearing is only 8 per cent - has pushed up its cost of capital and forced it to seek projects with an exceptionally high internal rate of return. Its current hurdle rate is 22 per cent in dollar terms. The addition of some debt funding, albeit cautiously, to its balance sheet would help bring its cost of capital closer to that of its main international competitors. Mr Ambani said he did not expect government approval for corporate debt issues before next year, but Reliance would be ready when it was granted. It has already sought a confidential credit rating from Standard  Poor's, the US credit rating agency. Though Reliance's current capital programme is fully-funded, the group plans to diversify within India and aims to raise overseas turnover to between 10 and 15 per cent of sales within the next three to four years, from 2 per cent at present. This could involve the establishment of overseas manufacturing plant, something which the govern-ment is starting to encourage. Reliance this week announced a 146 per cent increase in interim net profits to Rs5.1bn (Dollars 162.5m), in spite of a slight slippage in gross margins to 18.8 per cent from 19.4 per cent. This was blamed on a scheduled plant shut-down. Net profits were boosted by a sharp increase in investment income and a fall in depreciation charges, to Rs1.3bn from Rs2.1bn. Depreciation is likely to continue at a lower level, reflecting a change to Indian accounting rules, allowing assets to be depreciated over their full economic life.

He was  formerly a diplomat and a CIA official.      WASHINGTON      President George Bush triumphed at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  summit last week because he jettisoned a sterile Cold War ideology that marked  the first four months of his Administration and adopted new thinking that can  lead to genuine disarmament.    The President has moved ""beyond containment"" in response to evidence that  Mikhail S. Gorbachev has repudiated Soviet policies of expansionism and is  moving to demilitarize U.S.-Soviet competition. But partial military  disarmament will not be enough to end the Cold War. While it has been fueled by  an arms race, it has also been waged by clandestine paramilitary and political  operations and espionage. Bush should maintain his initiative by proposing  negotiations to terminate the clandestine war.    After 45 years of profound distrust on both sides, continuing secret operations  will be a barrier to stable coexistence. Throughout the Cold War, both  Washington and Moscow used each other's clandestine operations to measure true  intentions. No matter how much peaceful rhetoric was contained in the speeches  of superpower leaders, evidence of covert action and espionage was proof of  continuing aggression. These operations manifestly increase tension.    Two recent news stories are instructive. Over the weekend of May 20, the  British government expelled 11 Soviets -- eight diplomats and three journalists  -- as spies. In a typical tit-for-tat response, the Soviets expelled an equal  number of British diplomats and journalists from Moscow. Gorbachev's ""new  thinking"" has not yet changed the habits of the KGB. This event soured  British-Soviet relations. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an early supporter  of Gorbachev's programs, said the continuing espionage revealed ""that many  things remain the same. I'm disappointed . . . they have revealed their true  colors.""    The other concerns John Le Carre, the former British secret agent, who has  written some of the best Cold War spy novels. His latest book, ""The Russia  House,"" will be published in the Soviet Union. The book focuses on how  intelligence services, both East and West, block attempts, on both sides, to  end the Cold War. Le Carre says that spies will find new ways to keep anyone  from doing them out of their jobs by launching new espionage plots. All of this  resonates with the spy ousters in London and Moscow.    The 40-year record of clandestine operations, on both sides, is not impressive.  In fact, those operations have often caused serious setbacks to the security of  both superpowers. The Soviets were thrown out of Yugoslavia, Egypt, Ghana and  Guinea -- in large measure because KGB operations attempting to overthrow the  indigenous regimes were publicly exposed. With Egypt, the Soviets lost a  strategic Middle East base when the head of Egyptian intelligence was revealed  to be a KGB agent planning a coup to replace Anwar Sadat. The United States,  too, has sponsored numerous failed secret operations with disastrous  consequences, including the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the Iran-Contra  fiasco.    Even the so-called covert successes have, in time, often produced horrendous  negative repercussions. For example, in the period from 1969 to 1971, the most  important Soviet foreign-policy negotiation was with Chancellor Willy Brandt of  West Germany. It resulted in the recognition of East Germany. This agreement  did more to reduce the risk of war than any diplomacy since the end of World  War II. Shortly after, however, the West Germans discovered that an East German  spy, directed by the KGB, had long been employed in Brandt's offices. Brandt  was compromised and he resigned -- much to the embarrassment of the Soviet  government.    In 1969, when Chinese and Soviet forces engaged in border clashes, the Soviets  demanded that the Chinese negotiate. They refused. So the KGB launched a covert  operation, spreading rumors that the Soviets were about to launch a preemptive  strike to eliminate Chinese nuclear capability. The Chinese were intimidated,  and agreed to talk, but also began ""Ping-Pong"" diplomacy. In 1971, Henry A.  Kissinger made his secret trip to Beijing and soon President Richard M. Nixon  arrived to sign the agreement re-establishing relations between the United  States and China. Thus, a successful Soviet covert operation paved the way to  U.S.-Chinese rapprochement.    A covert operation claimed as one of CIA's greatest successes was the overthrow  of President Mohammed Mossadeq of Iran and restoration of the shah in 1953.  Mossadeq had been popular; the shah was not. His power came from secret police,  the military and U.S. assistance. The ensuing revolution brought with it  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's religious fundamentalism. This unfortunate turn  of events for the United States was rooted in a so-called successful CIA  operation.    During the height of the Cold War, covert operations were marginal at best;  today, they have become an anachronism. Gorbachev and his associates are  determined to dismantle Stalinism. They have rejected the goal of worldwide  communist states run from Moscow. They want to disarm by more than 50% and they  want to demilitarize competition with the West. They urge a ban on direct or  indirect military intervention in Third World disputes, including the use of  covert paramilitary forces. Thus, Gorbachev's policies are removing the  rationale for clandestine warfare. When it becomes clear that both sides have  given up the goal of winning the Cold War, it will be apparent that new  clandestine operations are counterproductive.    The process may have begun. Earlier this year, Jack Matlock, U.S. ambassador to  the Soviet Union, was invited to an unprecedented private meeting with KGB  Chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov. A recent unofficial joint study prepared by  U.S. and Soviet experts dealt with measures to end the Cold War. The Soviet  delegation noted that essential trust between the powers will not be possible  until espionage and covert operations have ended. The Soviets observed that as  long as there was a danger of war, every method of obtaining reliable  information was used -- but they noted that an important means to replace  espionage will be on-site inspection. In the past, the Soviet Union opposed  on-site inspection, fearing U.S. espionage. They have reversed that position by  accepting comprehensive provisions for verification.    After pressing the Soviet Union to accept on-site inspection for more than 30  years, some U.S. leaders are now expressing hesitancy. CIA Director William H.  Webster recently observed that the comprehensive verification procedures  proposed by the Soviet Union ""could be difficult if not dangerous."" Of course  they will be difficult, but if the Soviet Union is willing to open its defense  industry to U.S. inspection, it would be unconscionable for the United States  not to reciprocate.    Espionage may be the second-oldest profession, but it is also a hostile act.  Furthermore, it is no longer necessary. A combination of disarmament agreements  verified by on-site inspection and technological intelligence will provide  better security than at any time during the Cold War. Through the precision  cameras of space reconnaissance, the United States has photographed the entire  Soviet Union in minute detail. This information, when combined with electronic  interception, radar, code-breaking and computers, provides excellent  intelligence about Soviet military capabilities.    Now it is time to launch the negotiations to end the clandestine war. High  priorities should be given to removing intelligence personnel from embassy  staffs and U.N. delegations. Spy masters, operating under diplomatic cover,  have been a major source of distrust and an impediment to diplomacy. The  phasing-out of clandestine operations is difficult but essential, in order to  proceed simultaneously with political and disarmament negotiations.

There were some errors in it which I am happy to correct. First, the tribunals are independent judicial bodies and it is I, not the Department of Employment, who shoulders responsibility for their location and removal. Second, I have no plans to move the London North Tribunals from their present address in Woburn Place, WC1. It is one of the two largest tribunal centres in the country and will continue to serve the needs of the greater part of London. Third, it is necessary to move the London South Tribunals because the end of the lease of their premises is in view. Their catchment area, at present, stretches to the south coast and will eventually include the area of the Brighton Tribunal office. I therefore decided that a move out of central London had a number of advantages both as to cost and to site the tribunals more centrally in the region they will serve. The fact that one of the present chairmen tells your reporter that we are all 'hopping mad' may have a little to do with their personal convenience. The region's catchment area remains to be reconsidered and it is a little premature for the chairmen to decide that the move will be inconvenient to the tribunal users. I am confident that most users will find the move rather more convenient and accessible.

0,FT931-7919 ,"FT931-7919 _AN-DBVBWADBFT 930222   FT  22 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: ICI's splitting headache   Having christened its pharmaceuticals side and reformed its management structure, ICI is just one small step from the giant leap of demerger. The performance of its shares since the scheme was hatched last summer suggests some scepticism of the practical benefits of separation. Even allowing ICI the benefit of the doubt on that score, there is a danger its enthusiasm will cloud its judgment on timing. In the absence of a remarkable turn-around in the final quarter, ICI can scarcely afford to pay a maintained dividend for 1992. Cutting the Pounds 400m pay-out would be easier to present as part of a demerger package. But distributing a reduced dividend between the two sides of the business will not be easy. Chemicals barely nosed into profit in the third quarter. A cyclical chemicals business might be forgiven for paying an uncovered dividend at this stage in the cycle, but over-capacity and a looming European recession make it far from clear when this side of the business will be in a position to pay its way. One way of assuaging such fears would be for ICI to endow the chemicals balance sheet with cash, or ask the pharmaceuticals side to bear a greater share of the dividend. That can only be at the expense of Zeneca's rating. The plan to raise Pounds 1bn cash for the group as a whole on a fancy drugs-company multiple already looks dated. Glaxo now stands on a yield and price-earnings multiple close to the market average. Since Zeneca is suffering from the patent expiry of its biggest-selling drug - and has a less promising research pipeline - it might be expected to trade somewhat lower. By pricing its rights at a heavy discount, Zeneca could doubtless attract underwriters to the issue. But the arithmetic suggests that a cash call from a unified ICI would make more sense. By delaying demerger until the prospects for both sides of its business are clear, ICI would leave itself open to accusations of dithering. But fear of being seen as indecisive is never a good reason for action.   Companies:-  Imperial Chemical Industries.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Recent encouragement by UK ministers for farmers in the UK to establish agricultural co-operatives, like their counterparts in many member states of the European Community, focuses the spotlight on the inadequacies of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts which is the principal legislation under which agricultural co-operatives are registered. There have been a number of innovations in co-operative law in other European countries in recent years. These include the issue of non-voting shares or limited voting shares as well as financial instruments, similar to the permanent interest bearing shares issued by building societies, which might be traded on the stock market. Such improvements to co-operative law also appear in the proposal for a European co-operative statute which was issued in March 1992 by the European Commission. If the UK government seeks to enlarge a strong agricultural co-operative sector in the UK then it must ensure that co-operative law, in the form of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, becomes a modern and effective business medium while retaining co-operative principles. This will only happen if the Treasury gives a clear green light to its immediate update and to improving the resources of the Registry of Friendly Societies to examine legislative change.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a slight 0.29 off at 3,906.03, while the more broadly based Standard  Poor's 500 slipped 0.70 to 471.06. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite firmed 0.84 to 477.68 and the Nasdaq composite added 3.50 at 782.70. New York SE volume, at 318m shares, was heavy. Advancing issues led declines by 1,165 to 949. Overnight rallies on many foreign stock markets provided a positive tone for Wall Street, which was already cheered by Monday's rebound from a 96-point rout in the final session of last week. The Dow climbed about 10 points within minutes of the opening bell. However, in the absence of any leading economic news, share prices could not sustain their forward momentum. News of a 4.2 per cent gain in fourth-quarter non-farm productivity barely raised a ripple. Instead, investors were distracted by the US Treasury market, which continued to lose ground in the wake of the Federal Reserve's move to tighten short-term interest rates on Friday. The bench-mark 30-year issue was down  23/32 at 97 13/16 in late trading, amid concern over the issuance of new supply by the Treasury. Among the blue chips, heavy gains by some stocks were nearly balanced with hefty losses by others. Caterpillar powered Dollars 3 1/2 ahead to Dollars 108, while General Motors was lifted Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 . Sears Roebuck dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 after the retailer disappointed investors with its fourth-quarter operating results. By contrast, Allied Signal forged ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 77 3/8 after posting fourth-quarter net earnings of 41 cents a share, against 32 cents a year earlier, and boosting its dividend by 16 per cent. Alcoa, another Dow Industrial component, showed no signs of stumbling. It climbed a further Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 79 3/8 as investors followed through on Monday's announcement of deep production cuts. 3M appreciated Dollars 1 to Dollars 105 7/8 . In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer was marked down Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59 3/8 on warning of lower profits in the first quarter, following a sharp slowdown in sales growth in the final three months of last year. The bearish sentiment spilled over into some other drug stocks. Schering-Plough declined Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 60 3/4 . Consumer products companies, which have stayed out of the limelight in recent weeks, resurfaced with falls. Philip Morris shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 and Procter  Gamble Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 57. On the Nasdaq, America Online surged Dollars 3 to Dollars 73 1/2 , after a Dollars 5 3/4 rise the previous day. The company, which offers information services through home computers, announced a strategic alliance with NBC late on Monday. Among other technology issues, Sierra On-Line jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 22 7/8 on strong earnings, but Microsoft fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 78 3/4 . Canada Toronto showed a slightly firmer bias after fairly active trading. The TSE 300 index ended 3.5 up at 4,452.2 and rises outpaced falls by 435 to 346. Volume was 70.8m shares. The 14 stock groups were evenly split between rises and falls. Industrial products added 1.3 per cent and mining 1.2 per cent, while conglomerates and real estate also posted gains exceeding 1 per cent. Pipelines declined by 1.1 per cent. Brazil Sao Paulo was 4.6 per cent ahead by the close as investors awaited a congressional vote on a major element of the government's anti-inflation programme, which was approved by congress later that day. The Bovespa index gained 3,926 at 88,799, while turnover came to Cr176.8bn (USDollars 344.5m). Late yesterday Brazil's congress approved a key part of the government's economic stabilisation plan, voting in favour of a Dollars 16bn emergency fund.

ACTION:     Proposed Technical Amendment.               SUMMARY:     EPA is proposing a minor amendment to the rules for Boilers and Industrial Furnaces (BIFs). EPA believes that this amounts only to a technical amendment (because it reflects the Agency's intent as expressed either in the BIF rule or preamble), but is soliciting comment to assure opportunity for public participation. The amendment would add certain mercury-bearing wastes to the list of wastes that can be burned in metal-recovery furnaces pursuant to 40 CFR 266.100(c) without triggering the substantive BIF requirements.       Because the proposed amendment is minor, the comment period is limited to three weeks. After considering any public comments it receives and revising the amendment accordingly, the EPA may finalize it in the Land Disposal Restrictions Phase II Rule, scheduled for promulgation in July 1994. The Phase II LDR rule was proposed September 14, 1993 (see 58 FR 48092).             DATES:     Comments must be submitted by July 12, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Amendment of Boiler and Industrial Furnace Rules for Certain Mercury-Containing Wastes        The final BIF rule conditionally defers regulation of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces that burn hazardous waste solely for legitimate metal recovery. See 266.100(c). The rule provides three tests for the determination of burning solely for legitimate metal recovery. The heating value of the waste cannot exceed 5000 Btu/lb (if so, the waste is considered to be burned partially for energy recovery), the concentration of appendix VIII organic constituents in the waste cannot exceed 500 ppm (if so, the waste is considered to be burned partially for destruction), and the waste must have recoverable levels of metal.      The Chlorine Institute has informed the Agency that there are certain mercury-bearing wastes that can in fact be processed for mercury recovery but would be inappropriately classified as being burned for the purpose of energy recovery because their fuel value may exceed 5000 Btu/lb. These wastes, proposed to be listed in Appendix XIII to Part 266 by today's notice, are activated carbon, decomposer graphite, wood, paper, and protective clothing from the electrolytic mercury cell process used for the production of chlorine. These wastes can contain from hundreds of parts per million to percent levels (in some cases, as high as 45%) of mercury. (See in the RCRA docket for this notice the letter dated May 13, 1994 from the Chlorine Institute, Inc. to Matthew A. Straus.) The wastes also are already subject to a LDR treatment standard that requires recovery of mercury as the method of treatment. (See Table 2 in 40 CFR 268.42, D001 High Mercury Subcategory.) Under these circumstances, the Agency believes that it would be anomalous to consider these wastes to be burned for a purpose other than metal recovery based on the Btu content.     EPA notes that these wastes can only be recovered in devices that are either: (a) subject to the mercury National Emission Standard (NESHAP) found at 40 CFR Part 61 Subpart F; (b) subject to a Best Achievable Control Technology (BACT) or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) standard for mercury imposed pursuant to a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permit; or (c) subject to a state permit that establishes emission limitations (within the meaning of section 302 of the Clean Air Act) for mercury. (See Table 2 at 268.42, D001 High Mercury Subcategory, and 55 FR at 22570 (June l, l990).) Thus, air emissions from these devices should already be sufficiently controlled so that further RCRA regulation is unnecessary at this time. 55 FR at 22570. Consequently, this proposed amendment is consistent not only with EPA's intent in promulgating the deferral for metal recovery devices in the BIF rule, but is consistent with the Agency's determination in establishing LDR treatment standards for high mercury wastes that air emissions from mercury recovery devices were adequately controlled provided any of the three conditions set forth above (and in the rules) are satisfied.

Fernando Cortina Legarreta, president of the Confederation  of  Industrial Chambers, has said the economy's ""slow"" growth rate  will have little impact on job creation, illustrated by the fact  only a number of jobs comparable to the number lost in 1993 will  be created this year. He has said activities in other  production sectors will increase in the coming months and will  speed up until the GNP reaches 3 percent near the end of the  year. He has said the industrial sector is not seeking  refinancing, similar to that in the agricultural and livestock  sector, for its overdue loans and that the private sector and  the Association of Mexican Banks are talking to outline specific  financing plans for every productive sector. (Mexico City LA  JORNADA in Spanish 1 Mar 94 p 43)    According to the Mexican Stock Exchange, the Mexican  Government's internal debt increased by 40.3 billion pesos from  January to the first half of February 1994, a 31.5-percent  increase over the balance at the end of 1993. Most of the debt  increase during the period was incurred by the placement of  Treasury Bonds, through which the federal government obtained  approximately 26.2 billion pesos; this amount is equivalent to  65 percent of the internal debt increase during the period.  Circulating bonds representing the government's internal debt  amounted to 168.1 billion pesos up to 16 February, one of the  largest figures since September 1991. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in  Spanish 2 Mar 94 pp 60, 48)    As a result of the economic recession, 75 percent of the  states experienced a negative employment rate at the end of  1993. According to the finance group Bancomer, the number of  individuals registered at the Mexican Social Security Institute  (IMSS) was considerable, and 70,000 new jobs were opened.  Bancomer reports in the east, where agricultural and livestock  activities are predominant, 13,206 unemployed individuals were  reported; in addition, IMSS has reported 29,000 jobs were lost  due to the henequen crisis. Also, 641 new jobs were created in  Chiapas, 2,730 in Oaxaca, 4,334 in Quintana Roo, and 2,333 in  Campeche. Furthermore, 1,783 jobs were lost in Tabasco, 21,461  in Yucatan, and Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Hildalgo, and Puebla lost  8,273 jobs. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 2 Mar 94 p 16)    The National Banking Commission, Banamex, has reported as a  result of a reshuffling of accounts in the banking system, low  interest rates offered by banks, and the consistent loss of  salaries' purchasing power, the number of savings accounts  dropped by 61.45 percent in just 24 months. Conversely, the  number of time deposit accounts increased from 2,462,000 to  2,542,000, and the number of checking accounts increased from  3,510,000 to 4,453,000. Banamex experienced the greatest loss in  accounts. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 7)    Banamex's preliminary figures for 1993 show a deficit of  $2.2 billion in the basic chemistry sector. This figure, one of  the highest sector deficits in modern history, represents 20.7  percent of the total deficit. A large portion of last year's  imports were products that require neither high technology nor  large capital for the construction of new plants. For instance,  the importation of fertilizers increased by 113.84 percent, to  $151.3 million; essential oils to $35 million; chlorine to $2.5  million; tanning extracts to $14 million; medicines to $185.2  million; and dyes and varnishes to $178.9 million. (Mexico City  EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 8A)    According to Mexico City's National Chamber of Commerce  (Canaco), sales by more than half of Mexico City's businesses  dropped by approximately 39.1 percent last year, due mainly to  the economic slowdown. Only 13.4 percent of businesses saw  their sales increase by 13.1 percent. Interviewed businessmen  have said the economic slowdown was the largest problem,  particularly during the second half of the year. Some of the  businessmen have interpreted the occurrence to the economic  crisis, lack of liquidity, loss of purchasing power, and  recession. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 24)    Mexican Petroleum, Pemex, has reported the corporation ended  1993 with a positive commercial balance of $100.3 million.  Pemex has reported the sale of petrochemical products in 1993  was $17 million higher than in 1992 as the result of exporting  3,627 tonnes of greater value-added goods. During the same  period, Pemex marketed in various countries 1,232,800 tonnes  worth of goods, which brought $202.6 million into the treasury;  conversely, Pemex imported petrochemical products worth $18.4  million less than in the same period of 1992. (Mexico City  NOTIMEX in Spanish 0312 GMT 4 Mar 94)    A free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa Rica will  become effective on 1 January 1995.

A new foreign investment law that complements  NAFTA was enacted on 27 December to open to foreign investors  approximately 700 fields formerly reserved for Mexicans.  (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0405 GMT 4 Mar 94)    Gilberto Jimenez, National Council for Foreign Trade  president, has reported foreign investments worth $3.5 billion  arrived in the country during the first two months of the year.  A sizable portion of the money was invested in agriculture and  livestock, basic products, food, automotive, and electricity  industries. Most of the investment was made in the Mexican  Stock Exchange, however. He has also reported the commercial  deficit will continue to steepen due to increased exports. The  deficit is expected to reach $12 billion this year; in addition,  exports increased by 17.7 percent over last year's figure.  (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 4 Mar 94 p 11)    The Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development and  the Bank of Mexico have reported trade with other Latin American  countries increased by 118.9 percent between 1988 and 1933.  They have said during that period regional imports grew by  253.8 percent, while exports rose by 64.6 percent. According to  the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development and the  Bank of Mexico, Mexican exports to Latin America totaled $2.9  billion, which represents 10 percent of total exports. The  report concludes the largest trading partners of Mexico are  Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1700 GMT  7 Mar 94)    The economic slowdown in 1993 had an adverse impact on  companies that sell their stock at the Mexican Stock Market  (BMV). At the close of last year, 50 percent of the companies  operating at the BMV registered losses. On average the  companies operating at the BMV registered a 2.42-percent growth  rate. The 215 companies that sell their stock at the BMV  increased their assets from 37.4 billion pesos to 41.3 billion  pesos, a 10-percent increase. Meanwhile, the sector most  affected by the economic slowdown in 1993 was electronics, which  fell by 238.44 percent. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 7 Mar  94 p 19)    Financial experts have told EL FINANCIERO in the next few  months the peso will stabilize and revalue against the dollar.  After ruling out the risk of a devaluation, the experts have  admitted following a reduction in interest rates the slide rate  of the peso has increased. Meanwhile, sources at Moodys Brokers  have warned as long as yields remain low and the Stock Market is  not competitive, the demand for dollars will grow in border  states. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 10)    Mexicans have purchased $150-million worth of used cars in  U.S. states bordering Mexico, taking advantage of the new decree  by the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development which  allows importation of models to 1990.

Shopkeepers next to the Hong Kong joint-venture factory said  they saw the bodies of eight workers covered in blankets next to  huge mounds of rubble. Soldiers, Public Security Bureau (PSB)  officers and hospital workers were searching for an estimated 40  others early this morning.    Another 40 were in hospital, many with broken limbs.    The Yue Sun Textile Factory -- a joint venture between a  Hong  Kong merchant and the Zhuhai Qianshan Industrial Company is in  the Qianshan Industrial Zone about eight kilometres north of the  Macao border. It is one of the largest in Zhuhai.    Two weeks ago in nearby Shenzhen 11 people died when a  partially-built plastics factory collapsed.    PSB officers were refusing to comment but sources at the  scene said the workers were ordered back into the factory  yesterday by their Hong Kong bosses to salvage cotton damaged in  the blaze which gutted the factory on Thursday. They said  workers could be seen throughout all six storeys of the building  as it crumbled into a three-storey pile of rubble about 2 pm.  Rescue work was delayed for 30 minutes after debris caught fire  at 9 pm. Diggers and cranes moved in, allowing a human chain  formed by survivors to reach one man, screaming as his head  popped above the rubble.    Shopkeeper Chang Kamyick, 18, said: ""On the third floor I  saw  at least 20 workers. I heard a huge bang like an earthquake and  I turned and saw the building collapse within two minutes.    ""Ten workers ran out but others were trapped. One man only  had his head above the rubble. He yelled for help and a digger  went in to rescue him.    ""Many workers joined hands to pull him out. Others stayed to  look for survivors. Minutes later officials arrived to help.""    Other sources at the scene said the fire-damaged building,  which supported heavy machines on its middle floors, appeared to  be weakened after a four-hour downpour. Maintenance worker,  Liang Yuyang, 25, who was pulled unconscious from the wreckage  and rushed to hospital, said that when the building had  collapsed around him he had thought it was the end.    ""I had been going round the edge of the site, when suddenly  I  felt as if a water fall was gushing around me.I thought I was  already dead but I woke up in the hospital a few hours later.""    Mr Liang had been taken to the Xiangzhou Hospital in the  back  of a truck before being operated on for multiple injuries  including a broken leg. He said he had been working for around  one year and until yesterday had felt that the management was  good. Earlier in the evening the Mayor of Zhuhai, Liang  Guangda, visited some of the victims in the Xiangzhou Hospital.    Labour groups in Hong Kong reacted strongly, criticising the  decision to allow the workers to re-enter the factory before  ensuring it was safe.    ""It was irresponsible behaviour,"" said the chief executive  of  the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims,  Chan Kam- hong.    A fire had raged through most of the factory building on  Thursday, but no casualties were reported. Firemen from Zhuhai  and nearby cities put out the fire at dawn yesterday, and  workers returned to remove damaged yarn from lower floors.  Others were working outside the building. At about 2 pm after  torrential rain and strong winds, the front half of the building  collapsed. Zhuhai public security authorities sent hundreds of  officers and firemen to rescue the victims, and sealed off a  section of the highway to Guangzhou for ambulances and rescue  vehicles.    A spokesman for Zhuhai City People's Hospital said most of  its patients had minor injuries. Many had been treated and  discharged. Factory director Yeung Chi-kwong refused to comment  on why workers were allowed back into the scorched building,  saying management still had to clarify many questions. He said:  ""We can't answer your questions at the moment, because of  administrative reasons.""    Zhuhai residents gathered to see whether relatives were  among  the casualties.    The factory was one of the largest in Zhuhai and employed  more than 2,000 workers, most of them from Sichuan and Hunan  provinces. Portuguese news agency Lusa in Macao said it was a  300 million yuan (HK$267.6 million [Hong Kong dollars] )  investment.    Zhuhai Labour Bureau director Guo Boquan said preliminary  investigations showed the fire had been related to welding.     "

But it warned that while prices for many of its goods were rising, those 'nearer the consumer', such as paints, 'remain very competitive'. Its shares fell 12 1/2 p to 786 1/2 p. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said demand in most markets looked 'more promising than for some time. Activity in the US, UK and Australian markets remains generally firm. Recovery in continental Europe appears to be under way and even the Japanese economy seems to have bottomed. Robust growth in the rest of the Far East continues.' Third quarter pre-tax profits, excluding exceptional items, rose 82 per cent from Pounds 72m to Pounds 131m. Sales for the same period rose 8 per cent from Pounds 2.16bn to Pounds 2.35bn. Including exceptional items, such as the costs of closing the Canadian paints business, pre-tax profits were Pounds 143m, 59 per cent higher than a year earlier. Earnings per share for the quarter were 11.1p against 7.5p in 1993. ICI's polyurethane businesses were among the star performers in the third quarter. The materials division, of which it is a part, saw trading profits more than quadruple from Pounds 3m to Pounds 14m. Trading profits for the first nine months were Pounds 61m, compared with Pounds 19m for the same period of 1993. Third-quarter sales rose from Pounds 386m to Pounds 440m. ICI's biggest division, industrial chemicals, which includes petrochemicals and fertilisers, also performed strongly thanks to some 'sharp and swift' price rises for its products. Third-quarter trading profit rose to Pounds 71m from Pounds 21m as sales edged up from Pounds 902m to Pounds 977m. Nine-month profits totalled Pounds 180m compared with Pounds 80m in 1993. The poorest performer was paints, where third-quarter trading profits climbed from Pounds 34m to Pounds 37m on sales barely changed at Pounds 451m. Paints is one of the ICI's few businesses which sells directly to consumers. ICI said such businesses 'faced higher raw material costs and a limited ability to raise selling prices.' ICI is to spend Pounds 100m on a new plant in the Netherlands to make methyl diphenyl diisocyanate, a component in polyurethane manufacture.

Many efforts have been made for RD  on MCFC power generation system since the early 1980s in the  United States of America, Japan and Europe.    The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in  the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has  organized a national project (Moonlight Project) aiming for new  energy systems, in which MCFC project has been promoted in  cooperation with New Energy and Industrial Technology  Development Organization (NEDO) and their contractors. MCFC  Research Association was established in February 1988 to  accelerate the RD on stack operation, plant system and  equipment, coal gasification combined system, and new materials.    At present, a second-stage plan targeting the development of  a 1000kW class pilot plant is being conducted. In order to  achieve this target, 100kW class stacks by external reforming  type cells, peripheral equipment and system control technology  are to be developed and assessed by FY93. Then, the fabrication  of the 1000kW pilot plant will immediately start and a  demonstration test will be completed by FY97.    The current status of RD for MCFC power generation  system  are presented here.    1. MCFC Power Generation System    A basic power generation system of LNG fueled-MCFC is  illustrated in Figure 1. The system consists mainly of reformer,  stack, AC/DC converter, gas recycle blower (high temperature  blower), and heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).              Figure 1. Basic System of MCFC Power Generation        A gas mixture of LNG and steam is fed at 800C and 3ata  to the refomer tube packed with Ni catalyst on which reforming  reactions take place to form hydrogen rich gas. The resulting  gas is introduced to the anode and hydrogen reacts with  carbonate ion from cathode through electrolyte to generate  electricity. The anode exhaust gas is to the reformer and is  catalytically combusted to produce heat needed for endothermic  reforming reactions. The combusted gas containing carbon dioxide  is fed to the cathode. The cathode exhaust is recycled by the  high temperature blower to recover heat produced in power  generation. Energy in the cathode exhaust from the recycle line  is recovered by the turbine compressor and HRSG. Compressed air  by the compressor is fed to the cathode and oxygen reacts with  carbon dioxide and electron from anode to form carbonate ion.  Steam from HRSG is mixed with LNG at the inlet of the reformer.    2. Demonstration Tests at Akagi Research Laboratory (Akagi  Stack and System Square)    Akagi 3S was constructed in October 1990 by MCFC Research  Association to test 100kW stacks and 1,000kW plant equipment,  for example, reformer, high temperature blower, turbine  compressor, and HRSG by this September.    2.1 100kW Class Stack Operation Tests    NEDO is developing two 100kW-class MCFC stacks (multiple  large capacity type and rectangular large capacity type).    The test is intended for the confirmation of the performance  of these stacks. The target values of 100kW stacks are initial  cell voltage of 0.8V at 150mA/cmsup 2/sup  and decay rate of  less than 1/1000 hours.    Taking the test results into consideration, four 250kW fuel  cell stacks will be designed and manufactured as the main  component of the pilot plant.    2.2 1000kW Class Fuel Processing Subsystem Tests    The tests are aimed at confirming the performance of the two  newly developed reformers, namely: heat exchanger type and  two-stage catalytic combustion type (Figure 2). These reformers  produce hydrogen rich gas to be supplied to fuel cell anode.  Heat for processing reaction is obtained by the catalytic  combustion of low calorie anode exhaust gas. The tests with full  scale (1000kW) capacity are now proceeding.              Figure 2. Outline of Two Types of Reformer        The heat exchanger type consists of catalytic combuster to  produce 1200C gas and reformer tubes.    The anode exhaust is introduced to the first combuster and  combusted on a Pd/Alinf 2/inf Oinf 3/inf -ZrOinf 2/inf  catalyst to produce a gas of 1000C followed by secondary  combustion on thermally conductive SiC. A reforming catalyst of  0.24msup 3/sup  are packed in 6 reformer tubes of 165mm in  diameter. In case of the 1000kW plant, LNG of 141kg/h is fed at  S/C of 3 and hydrogen rich gas of 1154Nmsup 3/sup /h is  produced.    The two-stage catalytic combustion type consists of 16  reformer tubes of 165mm in diameter which are directly contact  with two combustion catalyst bed. The tube is a dual column type  and contains a reforming catalyst of 0.5msup 3/sup . The  configuration of the combustion catalyst bed was simulated from  physical and basic experimental data and verified by a 100kW  test plant. The start up time within 3.5hrs and NOx emission of  4ppm at steady state have been confirmed.    2.3 1000kW Class Stack Peripheral System Tests    The installation of the test apparatus was finished in  August  1993.    The performance of the newly developed high temperature  blower and cell differential pressure control will be tested. A  part of the control equipment and the high temperature blower  are completely manufactured.    Demonstration tests are intended to confirm: (1) optimum  differential pressure control method between the anode and the  cathode, (2) heat resistance and performance characteristics of  the high temperature blower, etc.    2.4 1000kW Class Heat Recovery System Tests    The full scale test facilities were constructed in August  1993.    Demonstration tests will be performed on the turbine  compressor for producing compressed air by means of the kinetic  energy of the cathode outlet gas and HRSG for producing the  steam for fuel processing reaction with recovered heat of the  turbine outlet gas.    Demonstration tests are intended to confirm:    (1) performance characteristics and emergency shutdown  characteristics of the turbine compressor, etc.    (2) heat conducting characteristics, load response and  startup/shutdown characteristics of HRSG.    Afterward    The development and demonstration of the 1000kW class pilot  plant as the ultimate target of the phase-II RD project of  the  MCFC power generation system will be started soon based on the  interim report of the Evaluation Subcommittee of the Energy  Conservation Technology Development Committee in the Industrial  Technology Council, an advisory organ for the Minister of  International Trade and Industry.    In order to enhance our activities for the construction of  the pilot plant, the research and development including fuel  cell stacks development was unified to our association and the  members from electric utilities was newly joined our association  in May 1993.    Acknowledgment    This work has been performed under the sponsorship of the  New  Energy and Industrial Technology Organization.     "

0,FT944-1751 ,"FT944-1751 _AN-ELSDLABMFT 941219   FT  19 DEC 94 / Conservative Party Funding: Gentlemen's clubs where money is on tap - How the Conservative party raises money from industry has long been one of the great puzzles of UK political life. In a special report, Peter Marsh, with William Lewis, Jimmy Burns, Roland Adburgham and Robert Peston, unravels some aspects of the mystery      By PETER MARSH, WILLIAM LEWIS, JIMMY BURNS, ROLAND ADBURGHAM and ROBERT PESTON   On Budget day three weeks ago the Treasury's economic measures were not the only talking point for a small group of Tory MPs from the west Midlands. A few hours before Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, addressed the Commons the MPs trooped into the Hyde Park Hotel in London's Knightsbridge for lunch with 12 top industrialists from the region. Behind talk about road links and the engineering industry the gathering had a deeper purpose for Major Peter Poncia, a Conservative Central Office official. As the industrialists munched cheese sandwiches and sipped white wine Maj Poncia watched out for people he might tap for money - all in the cause of reducing the Tories' Pounds 15m overdraft and putting the party in good shape for the next general election. Maj Poncia is secretary of the little-known Midlands Industrial Council, which arranged the November 29 meeting and is one of 10 such groups organised by the Tory party. The councils are a curious hybrid of gentleman's clubs and money-raising agencies. They are the focal points in a secretive network of several hundred Tory-supporting business leaders, drawn from all strands of industry but with an accent on individualistic, wealthy entrepreneurs who identify with the free enterprise cause. Many of the councils have been active since the 1950s but the extent of their activities has not been fully revealed. Most meet several times a year, often over dinners or lunches with Tory ministers or MPs. The occasions give Conservative-leaning industrialists the impression that they are helping to guide policy. Money is rarely mentioned at these sessions. That comes later, when the secretaries or council members follow up contacts with discreet requests for cash. The councils accept gifts from individuals but most donations come in the form of corporate gifts. The councils are thought to have been behind about 40 per cent of donations to Conservative Central Office in recent years, equivalent to about Pounds 3.3m a year. Lord Laing, former chairman of the United Biscuits food company and joint Tory party treasurer between 1988 and 1993, said: 'The councils use the old boy network and peer pressure. Each council aims to have 10 to 12 members. Each person would know another 10 or 12 people and (suggest) they make a donation.' Membership lists of the 10 councils, which have never been published, include several self-made millionaires. Sir John Hall, the miner's son who developed the Gateshead MetroCentre, Britain's biggest retail park, is a member of the Northern Industrialists Protection Association, the industrial council for north-east England. Names linked with the network range from representatives of big, publicly quoted companies to less well-known private groups. They include, for instance, Mr Colin Hope, chairman of materials company TN, who is on the north-west council, and Mr Harold Williams, chairman of Practical Car and Van Rental of Birmingham, who is chairman of the Welsh council. The Birmingham-based Midlands council - there is a separate East Midlands council - is among the most productive, raising an estimated Pounds 500,000 a year. The chairman is Mr Gareth Davies, chairman of Glynwed, a big Midlands engineering company which has given Pounds 274,000 to the Tories since 1986. Other members of the Midlands council include Mr Gary Allen, chief executive of the IMI metals company, which has given Pounds 215,000 over the past eight years, and Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN engineering group, which has donated Pounds 185,600 over the same period. Another powerful group is in the north-west, where the chairman is Lord Wade, a well-connected cheesemaker and former Tory party joint treasurer. The council is thought to raise about Pounds 300,000 a year. Across the Pennines an active fundraiser is Mr Charles Fenton, chairman of Bradford-based textile maker British Mohair Holdings, and chairman of the West Yorkshire Industrialists' Council. Mr Fenton said he was always on the lookout for successful companies. Mr Fenton said: 'If you hear of people drinking champagne and saying whoopee then it's reasonable to make an approach.' About three years ago Mr Fenton contacted Mr Jeff Whalley, a Yorkshire entrepreneur who is chairman of FKI, a Halifax-based electricals group, which had not previously given to the Tories. Mr Whalley joined the council and FKI has given a total of Pounds 105,000 to the party in the last three years. Mr Whalley said the Tories had made a success of the economy. 'If I thought they were doing an awful job I wouldn't back them.' The councils' secretaries are key people. Like Maj Poncia and Mr Lee they are Conservative Central Office officials. They report to Mr Richard Warner, a former banker who is head of Central Office's treasurer's department, which is responsible for finding donations, and are through him linked to Lord Hambro, chairman of Hambros merchant bank and chairman of the party's board of treasurers. Broadly equivalent to the council secretaries are three Conservative officials - in Edinburgh, Windsor and Newmarket - who raise money from industrialists in their regions, where there are are no fundraising councils as in other parts of the country. These three are thought to raise a further Pounds 700,000 a year, making an annual total of about Pounds 4m flowing to Central Office from the regions. Of the seven secretaries - two cover five councils between them - four have army backgrounds. The pattern of recruitment was set by Maj Gen Sir Brian Wyldbore-Smith, director of the treasurer's department for 22 years until 1992, on the grounds, as he explained, that military people are 'considered honest and amiable' and therefore get on well with executives. During Sir Brian's tenure the treasurer's department raised Pounds 122m - worth about Pounds 225m in today's money - from individuals and companies. Most senior cabinet ministers have addressed at least one fundraising dinner or lunch in recent years. Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, attended such a function last month at Manchester's St James's club as a guest of the north-west council. Mr John Major was the main guest at London's Cafe Royal in 1991 at a function which attracted 250 people. This was organised by the City and industrial liaison council, in effect the industrial council for London and the south-east, whose activities in a normal year are expected to lead to gifts of Pounds 1.5m. Ministers generally play a passive role, however. Few have first-hand knowledge of who gives what. The councils may clash with Tory constituency groups which can feel aggrieved that cash from local industrialists is going to the party's head office rather than helping its regional efforts. One of the party's constituency party agents said councils and constituencies sometimes tried to tap the same source. 'It's a question of who gets there first.' Not every council member sees his - few women are involved - main role as fundraising. Mr Grant Watson, a partner with Bristol surveyors Alder King and until two years ago chairman of the south-west council, said: 'There were some good social occasions. We had a lot of fun.' Mr Peter Foden, chairman of Cheshire-based ERF truck maker and a member of the north-west council for 25 years, said: 'The money doesn't buy favours, just the opposite. Industry has had a rough few years.' Most people in the network say raising money is getting more difficult.

0,FT942-8246 ,"FT942-8246 _AN-EEVAPABIFT 940521   FT  21 MAY 94 / Industrial groups propose Pounds 100m Tees clean-up      By CHRIS TIGHE   One of the UK's biggest estuary clean-up projects, intended to help transform the polluted Tees into a salmon river, has been proposed by Northumbrian Water and Imperial Chemical Industries. Northumbrian has this week submitted to Cleveland County Council a planning application for an effluent treatment works on a disused ICI waste-disposal site to deal with sewage from 400,000 Teesside residents and industrial discharges from ICI's Wilton petrochemicals complex. The eventual Pounds 100m cost of the two-phase project will be borne by Northumbrian from its capital programme. ICI will pay fees for each tonne of waste treated. Industrial development turned the Tees' lower reaches into one of Britain's filthiest waterways. It has improved since the 1960s due to environmental improvements by industry. But ICI, which has spent Pounds 100m since 1990 on environmental upgrading on Teesside, and Northumbrian are under pressure to do more. At present the National Rivers Authority, the watchdog, permits ICI's Wilton site a biochemical oxygen demand - a measure of river oxygen depletion due to pollution - of 80 tonnes a day, but has said it must be reduced to 50 tonnes by 1996. ICI hopes to achieve much of this cut by using the proposed plant to treat its pta (pure terephthalic acid) waste before discharge. To meet the authority's goal of bringing migratory fish back to the Tees by 1996, Northumbrian needs to change its Teesside sewage disposal methods. The first Pounds 50m stage of the project includes construction of a Pounds 35m underground transfer sewer along the Tees' south bank, so sewage is discharged nearer the river mouth. The second stage will include a higher standard of sewage treatment to meet the European Urban Waste Water Dir-ective, due to come into effect in the year 2001, and treatment of more ICI effluents. Mr Doug Shearer, Northumbrian's general manager of projects, said the plant would not involve incineration or the import of waste - both contentious issues on Teesside. It would use conventional biological treatment methods. 'Sewage is a wonderful food, the bugs love it,' he said. Cleveland County Council said there would be extensive consultation before a decision. The go-ahead is subject to the consent of the boards of both Northumbrian and ICI Chemicals and Polymers.   Companies:-  Northumbrian Water Group.     Imperial Chemical Industries.

The fund should give a strong boost to General Electric's power plant manufacturing business as it fights for global market share against rivals such as Europe's Asea Brown Boveri. Cash-strapped governments in developing countries, particularly in Asia, are increasingly willing to allow private sector capital to finance new electrical power plants. The venture represents a further shift in Mr Soros's investment strategy which has been mainly concentrated on volatile debt, equity and currency and commodity markets. Last year he moved into property. GE Capital and Quantum Industrial Holdings, a new fund to be managed by Soros Fund Management, will each invest Dollars 200m in the new venture, called Global Power Investments. The International Finance Corporation, the private financing arm of the World Bank, will be the third founding partner. The IFC's planned Dollars 50m investment is awaiting formal approval. The partners plan eventually to raise Dollars 2.5bn in equity finance from a wide variety of investors, ranging from businesses with interests in the construction or operation of power projects to passive investors. The initial focus will be on Asia - particularly China, India and Indonesia  -and on Mexico. GE Capital and various partners are in advanced discussions about projects in these countries. The fund is believed to be the first of its kind, although vehicles have been formed before now to invest in individual developing world power projects. Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE Capital, said the venture was an outgrowth of GE Capital's existing power financing business, which has focused mainly on the US market where it has financed more than Dollars 7bn of projects through a mixture of debt and equity. Mr Wendt said Mr Soros's involvement stemmed from a friendship between a senior GE Capital executive and an associate of Mr Soros. 'Mr Soros has not only a large amount of money at his disposal but a keen understanding of the rest of the world,' Mr Wendt added. 'He is a true international investor. Marry that with GE's international activities and we think we have an excellent combination.'   Companies:-  General Electric Capital Corp.     Quantum Industrial Holdings.

ACTION:     Notice of extension for submitting Showcase Demonstration project proposals.              SUMMARY:     On Friday, October 7, 1994, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published a notice inviting participation in Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Projects (59 FR 51186). DOE is interested in obtaining proposals from industrial electric motor system end users for projects that are intended to demonstrate and ``showcase'' electric motor system energy efficiency, productivity, and environmental improvement in varied industrial or municipal facilities and settings. Projects selected by DOE will become ``Showcase Demonstrations'' and are part of a larger, Federally-sponsored (DOE) program that is an industry-driven collaborative effort called MOTOR CHALLENGE. The experiences and successful results to be gained from the Showcase Demonstrations will be used to encourage other U.S. industrial companies with similar applications to adopt efficient electric motor systems, and therefore, to increase the market penetration of efficient electric motor systems on a widespread basis within the U.S. Todays notice announces an extension for the submission of Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Project proposals.           DATES:     The extended dates to guarantee consideration are: preliminary proposals must be received by March 1, 1995. Preliminary-proposals shall be considered as meeting the deadline if they are either: (1) received on or before the deadline date or, (2) postmarked on or before the deadline date. Preliminary-proposals which do not meet the deadline will be considered late applications and may not be considered. The preliminarily-accepted Showcase Demonstrations are projected to be announced by approximately April, 1995 and will be asked by DOE to provide final-proposals. The final proposals scheduled due date is approximately May, 1995. DOE is expected to finalize Showcase Demonstration project selection by approximately June, 1995. The initial Showcase Demonstration Workshop is scheduled to take place in June, 1995. It is envisioned that selected projects will have a duration of no more than 18 months, and therefore, projects are expected to be completed (the project's costs and benefits defined and validated) by November, 1996.

Speaking at a work meeting on straightening out the problem  of circulating fund shortages among major industries and trades  in the northeastern region here today, Yang Changji, vice  minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission,  said: Leading comrades in both the party's Central Committee  and the State Council have been constantly attaching importance  to reform and development of state-owned enterprises. For  years, although conditions of state-owned enterprises have  improved following the introduction of various state policies  and measures, certain problems remained. Currently, due to the  problems of circulating fund shortages, sluggish products sales,  and overstocks experienced by some state-owned industrial  enterprises, defaults of goods payments among enterprises have  become relatively serious.    Yang Changji said: The causes leading to the current mutual  indebtedness among enterprises have both similarities to and  differences from those of the past. The similarities involve  investments in fixed assets, fund shortages, behind-schedule  funding, and unsuccessful local fund-raising, while one  difference is that more and more funds have been diverted to  enterprises in producing finished products this year. Wanton  price revision by some enterprises and overall rises in  production costs are new causes.    He said: The general principle for solving the problem of  mutual indebtedness among enterprises should be strengthening  macroeconomic regulation and control, deepening reform, and  taking measures aimed at effecting a permanent solution to the  problem, under which enterprises themselves will be playing a  leading role in seeing that no new debts will be incurred while  exercising stricter control over fixed asset investment,  restricting production, reducing stocks, and promoting sales.  In the meantime, we need prompt actions that may bring quick  results, including using the smallest possible amount of credit  loans to improve cash flow, solving the problem of circulating  fund shortages among major industries and trades, and  guaranteeing the normal production of state-owned enterprises as  well as social stability.    It has been learned that major industries selected for  solving the problems of circulating fund shortages are coal,  metallurgy, nonferrous metals, electric power, chemical  engineering, and forestry. Since March, the State Economic and  Trade Commission, the People's Bank of China, the Industrial and  Commercial Bank of China, and the Coal Industry Ministry have  managed to help the metallurgical, electric power, and chemical  engineering industries settle goods payments due to 20 provinces  and municipalities and 75 major coal mines. The estimated  clearance of over 4 billion yuan will help alleviate the coal  industry's fund shortage problem to a certain degree.  Currently, thorough investigations into the problem of  circulating funds shortages in the five industries of  metallurgy, electric power, nonferrous metals, chemical  engineering, and forestry in the northeastern region have  completed.    Yang Changji emphasized: In settling the goods payments of  enterprises among each other, we should lend support to  enterprises whose products are in demand and marketable and  refrain from injecting funds into enterprises with slow product  sales and overstocks. In the meantime, strict checks should be  conducted to ensure that no circulating funds will go to fixed  assets, that all loss-making activities caused by fixed assets  investment will be stopped from top to bottom, and that funds  designated for settling debts will not be diverted to  engineering works and equipment under both infrastructure  construction and technical transformation programs. We should  intensify efforts to prevent new debts and, in particular,  enforce strict settlements when dealing with some enterprises  which simply refuse to pay without reason. Practices of  unreasonably holding or returning bills or refusing to pay  without grounds should be rectified conscientiously.    Addressing the meeting, Zhang Xiao, president of the  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, disclosed: In a bid to  ease the conditions of enterprises' fund shortages, banks have  enlarged their margins for loans involving circulating funds  since the second quarter. Recently, the State Council also  adopted a policy of handling loans involving circulating funds  on a case-to-case basis. With all these measures, the problem of  circulating fund shortages among enterprises should be  alleviated. She also pointed out: In solving the problems of  circulating fund shortages and mutual indebtedness of goods  payments among enterprises, the only way out is to exercise  stricter control over investment in fixed assets and excessive  rises in consumption funds and the enforcement of the policy of  ""restricting production, reducing stocks, and promoting sales""  against unmarketable products -- and not to rely on relaxation  of the money market.

In retrospect, Stihl also favors the employers' spectacular  cancellation of the metal industry's vacation compact. ""It was  necessary for the employers to give this unequivocal signal to  emphasize the seriousness of the situation. Such a sledgehammer  approach is sometimes needed when dealing with trade unions to  help them understand economic realities.""    Stihl said that this time the metal industry had been able  to  avoid disproportional increases for low-wage groups, which in  the past had contributed to a steadily rising unemployment base.  In the course of such mistaken wage policy, wage groups I and II  had been abolished. Thus, an important potential source of  employment was voluntarily eliminated. It would help facilitate  reincoporation of the unemployed if these two wage groups were  resurrected.    It is unfortunate that the Industrial Trade Union of Metal  Workers resisted an increase in the 13/18 percent ratio of  employers with a 40-hour workweek. An increase in this ratio is  necessary to strengthen research and development in the German  metal industry. ""It is still true that in Japan research and  development engineers and other highly qualified employees work  up to 600 more hours a year than in Germany. In the long run, we  cannot afford such a disparity.""    The current differentiation in the workweek in the metal and  electrical industry could be regarded as adequate, especially  since many companies have not taken full advantage of all the  options offered by the wage agreements. ""And for that I would  criticize the corporations; they demand greater flexibility  without taking full advantage of existing rules.""    Opening Wage Negotiations to Corporations Is Not Rescindable    The Hannover secure employment agreement, which opens the  way  for plants to negotiate wages, is limited to two years. There  will now be many deviations from collective bargaining  agreements. Stihl thinks that it will be impossible to rescind  such variations after two years to return to an industry-wide  wage agreement. ""The opening for the plants must and will  continue to exist; the traditional industry-wide wage agreement  cannot be maintained since it no longer meets the needs of a  widely varied industrial structure.""    However, Stihl opposes wage agreements differentiated by  metal branches. After all, industrial branches can develop wage  policies tailored to their needs since the plants now have that  opportunity. In the course of time, the in-plant agreements will  show certain patterns for each industrial branch since there  will be an internal exchange of information within each branch.  That should be enough. The overall metal-industry association  should not become the manager of the varied collective wage  arrangements of the different branches of the metal industry.  ""Because then, it would become necessary for the overall  metal-industry association to subdivide into numerous branch  associations. It is an advantage that we only have a few  associations in Germany which negotiate with the trade unions  independently. Thus, the authority to negotiate is consolidated  in the metal industry's overall association. But to allow as  many associations as possible to consolidate, the collective  wage agreements should only contain minimum provisions.""    If the economic climate improves again, the works councils  will try to rescind the wage sacrifices to which they have now  agreed. This will create many conflicts within plants, and the  Works Council Statute has not provided the machinery to resolve  such conflicts.    The president of the German Industrial and Trade Association  is convinced that the metal industry's Hannover wage agreement  will create a precedent for the public service sector. ""The  signals emanating from the collective bargaining agreements of  the Industrial Trade Union of Metalworkers--the largest  industrial trade union in Europe and even the world--have always  determined subsequent agreements with other trade unions.  Actually, the agreement with the Public Services,  Transportation, and Traffic Trade Union should fall  significantly short of that of the metal industry.""    Stihl called on German industry to pay more attention to  college and university graduates. His firm is currently  conducting an 18-month training program for such graduates with  reduced pay in which they can gain work experience and augment  their expertise.    Stihl commented on the dispute about nursing-care insurance,  which industry considers to be badly conceived. If it fails,  there is a chance that it could be reinstituted under private  law, which is the only approach industry approves. ""The  political contortions that an amazed public has been exposed to  hurts the reputation of all parties."" That a team of experts is  now supposed to find a mode of compensation, ""is simply another  harebrained idea in a long series of strange ideas that have  been advanced on this subject.""    Commenting on the economic programs that the political  parties have now evolved, Stihl said they all seemed acceptable  at first glance. For instance, if the German Social Democratic  Party [SPD] calls for greater fiscal economy or for relief for  industry, one can support the idea. However, when it comes to  financing, it becomes apparent that the SPD wants to resurrect  preoccupation with envy. It talks about ""unwarranted income,""  and wants higher taxes on the income of top management.    Politics Cannot Produce Jobs    This is not the way to finance the government, just as  politicians cannot solve the unemployment problem with work  programs. ""There is only one primary labor market and all  political attempts to stimulate employment by artificial means  are bound to fail.""    Instead of becoming entangled in employment policies, the  government should cut expenses. ""There is no reason why Germany  needs to pay for 16 land governments, 16 landtags, 16 land  administrations and more than 600 Bundestag representatives.  Consolidation is just as urgently needed here as in industry.  However, contrary to political institutions, industry attacks  its problem with great zest.""    Stihl criticized the ""remarkable lack of scruples,"" the  United States demonstrated to create the tools to apply pressure  on Japan's trade policies. It is, of course, correct as always  maintained that the type of surplus Japan achieves in trading  with North America can only be explained by the fact that  Japanese markets are not so open as is always claimed.  Distribution channels in Japan are firmly in the hands of large  conglomerates which can control the success or--more often--the  failure of an importer. Thus, one does have a right to demand  that Japan become more open. But according to Stihl such demands  for openness should apply to the whole Western world and not  just bilaterally to the United States.    German industry welcomes the expansion of the European Union  with the addition of the nordic states and of Austria. These  states are aware of the need for stability and favor free trade.  However, this expansion creates a need for reform within the  European Community. Sixteen countries can no longer be subjected  to Brussels' penchant for regulations but must be treated in  accordance with the principle that only those acts are  legitimate that member states cannot perform for themselves.

The  Yanji Industrial and Communication Material Trading Company of  Jilin Province and its Korean counterpart has recently reached  an initial agreement, where the said company will invest 370  million yuan to jointly develop Chongjin Port in the DPRK. This  is one of the starting moves to develop a big golden triangle in  Northeast Asia.    Chongjin Port is a free port of the DPRK opened to the  outside world. It is located in DPRK at the edge of the big  golden triangle of the Tumen Jiang in northeast Asia, the  development of which has been decided by the UNDP [United  Nations Development Program]. It is also the starting point for  a Eurasian railroad, which holds a vital position in the  development of a big golden triangle of the Tumen Jiang in  northeast Asia.    As disclosed by a relevant source, the Yanji Industrial and  Communication Material Trading Company began to contact relevant  parties of the DPRK in many ways last year, and reached an  initial agreement to jointly develop and use Chongjin Port.  According to the agreement, the Chinese company will be  responsible for the transformation and extension of the East  Chongjin Port, and the period for cooperation and use will be 50  years; both sides will be collectively responsible for the  construction of the Hoeryong-Chongjin Highway with a total  length of 95 km and a hotel with an area of 30,000 square  meters. The total investment amount from the Chinese side for  the extension of the port and the construction of a highway and  the hotel will be 370 million yuan. After Chongjin Port comes  into use, ships from countries and regions including the ROK,  Japan, the United States, Taiwan, and Hong Kong will be allowed  to enter and exit the port, and the DPRK will provide  preferential terms and other measures of guarantee.    The handling capacity of the port after expansion will  increase from over 1 million metric tons now to over 20 million  metric tons. Certainly, this will substantially promote economic  cooperation and trade exchanges in Northeast Asia and the world.  In the meantime, it will also alleviate a shortage of ocean  transport among the countries of the Northeast Asia region,  activate the economy in the big golden triangle, and expedite  the development of the lower reaches of the Tumen Jiang.

But in a second decision, greeted with relief by many environmental campaigners, the judge ruled that Greenpeace was legally entitled to bring its challenge, and was not just 'a meddlesome busybody'. The local pressure group Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment, based near Sellafield, described the ruling as 'good news and bad news'. The group was 'disappointed' that testing had been ruled legal, but it welcomed the decision that Greenpeace's challenge was legitimate. Mr Andrew Lees, director of Friends of the Earth, a pressure group which has recently won leave to bring court actions about drinking water quality against water companies, said that yesterday's decision on Greenpeace's right to bring the action, was 'very important' for environmental campaigners. 'BNF had the cheek to argue that organisations such as Greenpeace had no right to go to court to try and protect the environment,' he said. 'But if we did not, who represents the butterflies and frogs?' Greenpeace, which argued that the testing prejudged the government's decision whether to give the plant a licence to start full operation, is considering an appeal against the decision to allow preliminary testing to continue. Mr Justice Otton ruled that nuclear industry regulatory authorities - the Ministry of Agriculture and the pollution inspectorate - had acted rationally and lawfully when they gave the go-ahead in August for testing. Mr David Bonser, BNF's divisional director for Thorp, yesterday said: 'I am very pleased that jobs have been safeguarded and that we can carry on with the commissioning of Thorp.' Thorp's future is now the subject of a public consultation, which ends on October 4. A decision on whether the plant will get the go-ahead to start full operation is expected later in the year. Environmental groups' right to bring court actions has been challenged before. In 1990, a court ruled that the Worldwide Fund for Nature did not have 'sufficient interest' to apply for a judicial review against a decision by Poole Borough Council in Dorset to build a housing estate on a heath, home to several rare species.

The survey was released as Manpower, the employment services company, forecast that the recent gradual upswing in confidence about job prospects would continue into the last quarter of the year in spite of rises in unemployment in July and August. The organisation's regular quarterly survey of more than 2,000 employers showed that 23 per cent forecast job increases and 16 per cent job losses. The Industrial Society survey shows that enjoyable work, good pay and a sense of achievement rate more highly than job security among employees. It found that one in three employees in the south are dissatisfied with their work. Public-sector employees are most satisfied and those in the financial services and engineering sectors least. Only 17 per cent of employees said they could contribute to their full potential at work. Ms Christine Garner, head of the society's southern region, said: 'Job security is a concern for everybody, but not an expectation for anybody. People know they no longer have jobs for life.' A good relationship with the boss, good terms and conditions of employment, a good working environment and status have even lower priority than job security. Manpower said: 'Overall the trend which emerges from the forecasts of this quarter continues to bear a distinct similarity to the same period 10 years ago, when the UK was emerging from the 1979 recession.' The survey showed that only one region, East Anglia, was forecasting a decrease in job levels for the last quarter, compared with six regions for the same period last year. The public sector was the worst-affected sector for job prospects for the seventh consecutive quarter, with the service sector the most optimistic. The manufacturing sector saw the greatest improvement over last year with a swing from a net balance of minus 4 per cent to a positive net balance of 7 per cent. It is 11 times harder to get a job now than when Mr John Major, the prime minister, left school in 1959, a Labour party survey says today. Mr Frank Dobson, employment spokesman, says research shows there were two people after every job then. The figure is now 22.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The decision surprised analysts and institutional investors. 'After the departure of chairman Pat Rich earlier this year, this is rather unsettling. There have been a few too many changes,' said one analyst. The industrial gases and healthcare group said Mr Clubb, 53, had resigned. 'There is no question that he has been pushed. He wanted a change of life-style, away from executive to non-executive,' said Mr Christopher Marsay, BOC's investor relations manager. 'There will still be plenty of continuity at BOC. Mr Clubb will still be available to us as a consultant, and the heads of our three divisions remain in place.' Mr Clubb, who joined the company from British Satellite Broadcasting in 1991, will leave at the end of September. A successor had not been appointed, and was likely to be found outside the company, said Mr Marsay. Mr Rich resigned as chairman in April for reasons of ill health. He was replaced - in a non-executive role - by BOC's former chairman, Mr Richard Giordano, who had stepped down only two years earlier. Mr Giordano is also non-executive chairman of British Gas. Mr Alexander 'Pat' Dyer, 61, former executive with Air Products, the US industrial gases group, took over the role of chief executive from Mr Rich last year. Analysts speculated yesterday that Mr Dyer might have clashed with Mr Clubb. Mr Clubb will succeed Mr Rupert Hambro as chairman of Tiphook after the company's annual general meeting, which is expected in September. Mr Hambro will remain on the board as a non-executive director. Mr Hambro, who joined Tiphook in 1990, took over as temporary as chairman in March, after Mr Robert Montague, the group's controversial founder, stepped down but remained chief executive. Tiphook escaped liquidation in March by selling its biggest asset, its container business, to Transamerica, the US financial services group, for an initial Pounds 673m. Tiphook still has debts of about Pounds 500m. Mr Hambro said: 'Ian Clubb's wide financial experience will add much, in particular, to the strengthening of the group's financial disciplines. 'With the sale of the container business behind us, the company is now making some headway. The management continues to concentrate on reducing costs, maximising cash flows and winning new business.'

DoE officials, who will spend the next few weeks assessing the replies, said they reflected both strong support and opposition to the plant. The latest consultation focuses on the economic case for the Sellafield plant, and on wider questions of the proliferation of plutonium and nuclear weapons capability. Thorp, which has taken Pounds 2.8bn and nearly 10 years to build, is waiting for a licence to start operation. It is designed to take used fuel from nuclear reactors and separate out the reusable uranium and plutonium. British Nuclear Fuels, Thorp's owner, delivered 12,000 of the letters in favour of the plant from its employees and Cumbria residents yesterday. Mr Nick Johnston, secretary of the Windscale branch of the GMB general union, said that BNF had also gathered 22,000 signatures to petitions backing the plant. However BNF added that there might be overlap between letters and petitions. The DoE has received several hundred letters from Japan, many of which are understood to oppose the plant. Japanese power utilities make up the largest single tranche of BNF's order book for the next 10 years. The DoE has also received about 40 letters from Ireland, opposing the plant because of fears of radioactivity crossing the Irish Sea. Yesterday Greenpeace brought traffic in Whitehall to a standstill as it organised a demonstration outside the gates leading to Number 10, the residence of Mr John Major, the prime minister. Wearing black paper one-piece suits and party masks designed as skulls heads, 600 Greenpeace volunteers lay down in the road. Greenpeace, which said that 44 protesters were arrested, claims that 600 people worldwide will die from radiation discharged by Thorp in the first 10 years of its operation. BNF has maintained that the plant poses no risk to health. The first public consultation into the plant, which ended early this year, concluded that the environmental and health risks were insignificant. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said yesterday that he hoped that the decision on Thorp's licence 'will be settled by Christmas'. The High Court is expected to expected to deliver its judgment on Friday on the case of two families who claim to have suffered from exposure to Sellafield radiation.

0,FT942-2466 ,"FT942-2466 _AN-EFSAXAABFT 940618   FT  18 JUN 94 / Nuclear site clean-up costs more than double to Pounds 8.2bn      By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor   The cost of cleaning up the UK Atomic Energy Authority's nuclear sites has more than doubled, according to government estimates released yesterday. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said the authority's liabilities were now estimated at Pounds 8.2bn, against a previous estimate of Pounds 3.4bn. That consisted of about Pounds 6bn to decommission the authority's own sites, and a further Pounds 2bn for fuels and wastes and for cleaning up British Nuclear Fuels sites. Mr Eggar said that the increase was because of: Inclusion of new costs - for example, looking after sites during the various phases of decommissioning, which can last 100 years. Costs for assessment studies and research and development. The completion of fuller studies of dismantling costs and the volumes of waste created. Greater allowance for contingencies. The authority's sites are mainly experimental nuclear reactors at Windscale, Dounreay, Harwell and Winfrith. Since April, responsibility for decommissioning has been with UKAEA government division. The remainder of the authority, renamed AEA Technology and comprising the technology and consultancy operations, is now being prepared for privatisation. Its sale value has been estimated at Pounds 250m. Mr Derek Pooley, chief executive of UKAEA government division, said yesterday he hoped the decommissioning work could be completed below the estimates. 'It's our job to get the costs down,' he said. The actual, or discounted, cost of the UKAEA clean-up will be Pounds 5bn. It is normal practice in the nuclear industry to set aside financial provisions well before they are needed, and allow them to grow with compound interest. The discount rate used is 2 per cent. The latest estimates suggest that the total undiscounted cost of decommissioning the UK's existing nuclear installations will be about Pounds 22bn-Pounds 23bn. A year ago, the National Audit Office put the total cost at Pounds 18bn, using the AEA's earlier estimates. But it warned that those estimates were 'understated because of optimistic assumptions and significant omissions'. The British Nuclear Industry Forum, a trade group, said the new AEA figures had no bearing on estimates for other nuclear installations owned by Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two state-owned utilities. The government is conducting a review of the nuclear industry to see whether further expansion can be financed by the private sector. Decommissioning costs are one of the key issues determining the economic viability of nuclear power.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The RSPB, backed by a majority of UK fishermen, is campaigning for controls on the upsurge in industrial fishing in the run-up to tomorrow's fisheries debate in the House of Commons and next week's meeting of the European Union's council of fisheries ministers. Industrial fishing fleets catch small shoaling fish such as sandeels, capelin and sprats, which are usually eaten by larger fish, seabirds and dolphins. The small species are turned into fertiliser or feed for livestock and farmed fish. This type of fishing, carried out mainly by Denmark, now accounts for about 50 per cent of the total catch from the North Sea by weight, says the RSPB. Landings of sandeels, which are not subject to quotas, have doubled over the past 20 years to 800,000 tonnes a year and represent half the industrial fishing catch in Europe. The UK charity is calling for quotas for sandeels and for a ban on all industrial fishing in areas where fish are spawning or where there are important colonies of seabirds or other wildlife. It also wants the UK to stop granting licences for industrial fishing and says the European industrial fishing fleet should be phased out by decommissioning vessels. Fishery scientists have calculated that yields of commercially valuable fish such as cod and haddock on the Dogger Bank, an important North Sea fishery, would increase by 10-20 per cent if the Danes stopped catching sandeels there. Mr Euan Dunn, RSPB marine policy officer, said: 'Fish stock enhancement is a compelling argument for the government to press for controls on industrial fishing, especially at a time when it is investing heavily in other measures like decommissioning to reduce fishermen's impact on roundfish stocks.' One model for regulation is a government plan for restrictive quotas when the sandeel fishery off the Shetland Islands is reopened next summer, he said. The fishery was closed in 1990 after a sharp fall in stocks, which had a crippling impact on breeding of arctic terns, kittiwakes and puffins. The Scottish Office is proposing a quota of 3,000 tonnes, based on the two lowest annual catches of sandeels in the area before its closure.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Yugoslav government, in an attempt to restore confidence, claimed the new dinar would be fully convertible, and backed up by DM500m (Pounds 195.3m) in hard currency and gold reserves. It would be pegged at a rate of one German D-Mark. However, yesterday inhabitants of Belgrade waited in vain for the new banknotes to arrive in the Serbian capital. The payment of pensions was postponed. There was scant hope of converting dinars into hard currency after reports that the procedure would be complicated and take days. Shopkeepers closed their doors, grappling with the complicated task of introducing two accounting systems. The economy of the rump Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - has been devastated after 20 months of United Nations sanctions, nearly three years of war and the collapse of trade between the former Yugoslav republics. Inflation ran at 1m per cent for December alone. Industrial production has dropped by about 60 per cent in relation to three years ago. Almost half the 2.4m non-agricultural labour force is without jobs. The average monthly wage last year fell to DM10 from DM550 in 1990. Last autumn, with inflation in the trillions, the government slashed 15 zeros off bank notes in a bid to keep the dinar in use. Old dinars, which yesterday were trading at 13m for one new dinar, will remain in circulation. But D-Marks have virtually replaced the national currency, and 'markici', the Serbian nickname for pfennigs, are likely to remain the most treasured commodity. Belgrade economists said the government's reform programme failed to tackle the economy's main problems, such as the need to cut public spending, subsidies and military spending. Instead it relies on steep tax rises, especially in the tiny private sector, to raise money for the empty state coffers. The programme will levy a range of new taxes on businesses, which some companies, already hit by UN sanctions, fear will drive them out of business. Mr Jurij Bajec, an economics professor at Belgrade University, cautioned: 'This programme has a chance if the government takes it very seriously and acts very responsibly.' Mr Danijel Cvjeticanin, an economics professor, said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was afraid to shut loss-making factories. 'Most workers are idle but are still paid. The state will now be forced to pay social benefits rather than individual businesses.'   Countries:-  YUZ  Yugoslavia, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

Traders remained worried about further US interest rate rises, which would slow the US economy and corporate earnings growth. Investors appeared to be selling shares and opting for the higher income from bonds. The shares sell-off continued this morning when the Tokyo market opened. The Nikkei 225 average fell about 200 points in early trading. Brokers said selling was across-the-board. US shares fell again yesterday after steep stock market falls in Europe and Asia. At one stage, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 30 points, with computerised selling programs again responsible for much of the decline. The market later rallied and at the end of the second busiest trading day of the year, the Dow closed only 3.36 down at 3,674.63. Meanwhile, the price of the key 30-year US Treasury bond closed up almost three-quarters of a point, pushing the yield down to 7.94 per cent, its first dip below 8 per cent this month. The Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point last week - the sixth rise this year - appears to have been a watershed. So far this year, the Dow average of 30 leading stocks has outperformed the broader US market, but investors have now decided to sell the big industrial, or 'cyclical' stocks, which make up much a large part of the Dow. They fear the earnings of these companies will suffer as the Fed's rate increases slow growth next year, and believe government securities offer more security and better returns at the moment. Mr Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Kidder Peabody in New York, said: 'I think people feel it's more attractive to put their money in the bond market right now.' In London, the FT-SE 100 index opened about 40 points lower and, with no relief from early Wall Street trading, ended 51.2 points down at 3,027.5, its fifth-largest fall this year. Other European markets fell by about 1 per cent to 2 per cent, with the Dax index in Germany down 1.6 per cent in after-hours trading. Asian stock markets reacted badly to Tuesday's Dow decline. Hong Kong led, with the Hang Seng index dropping a further 4.2 per cent after Tuesday's 3.8 per cent decline.

These funding  measures, which are specially tailored to the needs of small-  and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs], were launched back in 1990  and 1991 and have already achieved initial positive results in  terms of the stabilization of industrial research in the new  federal laender. The [word omitted in original] of industrial  research in the new federal laender was primarily up to private  industry, stressed Federal Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger,  although the radical changes that the new laender were currently  undergoing necessitated a substantial commitment on the part of  the state over a transitional period. The three special  measures concerned consist in:    1. Funding for RD Staff Expansion    SME's receive subsidies equivalent to 50 percent of the  salaries of scientists and engineers newly recruited to set up  or expand their in-house RD capability. Since 1990, 932  mainly  small, innovative businesses have been funded to the tune of 45  million German marks [DM], making it possible to secure 2,800  industrial research jobs.    The deadline for applications for inclusion in this measure  has been extended to 31 December 1995.    2. Contract Research East    Also since 1990, SME's have been receiving 50-percent  subsidies when they award RD contracts to specialized  RD  contractors in Germany and abroad. This offer of funding has to  date been taken up by 863 businesses for 1,273 RD contracts.  Subsidies totaling DM110.4 million have thus set contracts for  an overall value of DM225 million in motion.    3. Contract Research West-East    This measure supports research facilities and firms that  obtain RD contracts from elsewhere, in particular from the  original federal laender and eastern Europe, with 35- to  40-percent subsidies. The rate of take-up is particularly  brisk, and the trend is extremely satisfactory. The measure  helps the research facilities in the new federal laender to  adapt to market requirements. Since 1991, 485 facilities have  taken advantage of this program to win a total of 1,024 RD  contracts for an overall value of DM208 million, the BMFT  [Federal Ministry of Research and Technology] share amounting to  DM80.8 million. Between them, these two varieties of contract  research contributed to the preservation of about 2,000 jobs in  industry-oriented research in 1993.    The deadline for applications for inclusion under these two  measures has been extended to 31 December 1994, after which  firms may apply to the nationwide ""Joint Research in the SME  Economy"" program, which has recently been relaunched by the BMFT  and, if initial impressions are anything to go by, is really  gathering momentum.

Mosenkova, engineer, Institute of High Temperatures at Russian  Academy of Sciences; UDC 621.181:629.9]    [Abstract] A method has been developed for waste-free  removal of sulfur dioxide from exhaust gases emitted by  metallurgical plants and power plants into the atmosphere. As  the sorbent is used sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, either  of these two compounds being chemically more active than the  conventionally used analogous calcium compounds. The new method  is not only almost waste-free but also more efficient, inasmuch  as up to 95 % or even more of the SO[.sub]2[/] content will  be removed, and simpler than the conventional one. The processes  taking place are reaction of the sodium compound with sulfur  dioxide in the presence of oxygen, which results in formation of  sodium sulfate and sodium sulfite, followed by reduction of both  these salts by methane, carbon monoxide, or molecular hydrogen.  The principal end product is sodium sulfide, which by treatment  with carbon dioxide and water vapor will be converted into  sodium carbonate and hydrogen sulfide. A pump feeds sorbent from  a storage tank into the flue duct for removal of sulfur,  whereupon the clean exhaust gas pass through a dust trap-  separator cyclone chamber into the air while the sodium sulfur  salts are precipitated into an extractor into which also water  is injected. Their water solution is fed into a centrifuge, from  where they are loaded for sorbent regeneration while residual  ash falls out. The equipment in such sorbent regeneration plant  consists of:     -  evaporator    -  centrifuge discharging water    -  Claus furnace discharging sulfur    -  afterburning furnace for sulfur dioxide + hydrogen sulfide  mixture    -  scrubbing chamber    -  methane combustion chamber with air injection and    -  melting chamber (1200ëC) for sodium sulfur salts  including  makeup sodium sulfate    -  methane incomplete-combustion chamber with air injection and    -  sodium sulfur salts reducing chamber (900ëC)    -  carbonizer with carbon dioxide and water vapor injection    -  two collector tanks, one for sodium sulfur salts coming in  from  the user and one for sodium carbonate going out to the user  respectively.     Inasmuch as installation of such an equipment in every  plant and  especially in small ones is costly, regional centralization of  the treatment is proposed: one sorbent regeneration plant to  collect on tank trucks sodium sulfur salts from all users in the  region and to deliver to them on tank trucks regenerated sodium  carbonate. Such a scheme is demonstrated on a radial grid with  the sorbent regeneration plant at an optimum location within the  Tula-Ryazan-Tambov-Lipetsk perimeter. Figures 3; references 10.     "

0,FT943-581 ,"FT943-581 _AN-EI1EIAFZFT 940928   FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below 19,500 to five-month low      By ROBERT PATTON      BY TOKYO   Stocks plummeted in thin trading to their lowest levels since April as arbitrageurs unwound positions following a plunge in index futures prices, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average fell 345.47 to finish at 19,468.89, the first close below support at 19,500 since April 4. After reaching the day's high of 19,822.16 during the morning, the index declined to a low of 19,404.18 in the final half-hour of trading. On September 19, when the Nikkei 225 last approached the 19,500 mark, public funds moved in to arrest the decline. This time, public funds, comprising state run postal savings and insurance, seemed to remain on the sidelines. Volume was an estimated 231m shares, little changed from Monday's 239.41m. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 22.46 to 1,562.75, while the second section lost 5.59 at 2,231.43 in volume estimated at 5.99m shares. Losers surged ahead of winners by 769 to 227, with 159 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE Nikkei 50 index gained 2.63 at 1,279.43. As on Monday, most traders stayed on the sidelines, reflecting uncertainties surrounding the US-Japan framework talks and Tuesday's meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee. Yesterday was also the last trading day for delivery of September index futures. The thinness of the market made it vulnerable to a wave of afternoon selling that began with futures traders closing positions. The ensuing decline in futures prices triggered dumping of speculative stocks and unwinding of arbitrage positions. The resulting price slide was accelerated by index-linked selling and rumours that Morgan Stanley was cutting the weighting of Japanese stocks in its portfolio. Japan Telecom, being closely watched ahead of next month's listing of Japan Tobacco, fell Y30,000 to another low of Y4.02m. Other telecommunications stocks were mixed. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dipped Y1,000 to Y884,000, but DDI, which lost Y8,000 on Monday, rallied Y7,000 to Y878,000. Steelmakers suffered losses in some of the heaviest trading of the day. Nippon Steel, the volume leader, edged down Y2 to Y385. Kobe Steel slipped Y5 to Y326, Kawasaki Steel lost Y6 to Y432 and NKK ticked down Y1 to Y289. Electricals also came under fire. Matsushita Electric Industrial receded Y30 to Y1,600, Fujitsu Y10 to Y1,040, Hitachi Y10 to Y955 and Oki Electric Industrial Y5 to Y755. In Osaka, the OSE average slid 257.66 to 21,843.87 in volume of 36.3m shares. Roundup Lassitude afflicted several of the region's equity markets, as investors sat on their hands in advance of yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington. However, there were one or two winners. HONG KONG closed mildly weaker in drowsy trading, the Hang Seng index easing 33.39 to 9,610.24 in turnover down from HKDollars 3.50bn to HKDollars 2.85bn. HSBC, the most active issue, lost 25 cents at HKDollars 87.50. It was followed by Hongkong Land, down 10 cents at HKDollars 19.35, while Hong Kong Telecom was 10 cents off at HKDollars 15.50. Sino Land, the most active of the new index entries on Monday, retreated 12.50 cents to HKDollars 8.625, and Johnson Electric declined HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 21.50. SYDNEY was nervous about interest rates as the All Ordinaries index dipped 16.2 to 2,013.8. Resources issues were dragged down by falls in the golds sector following a bullion price decline in New York, and by lower commodity prices in the US. The gold shares index dropped 46.5, or nearly 2 per cent, to 2,343.8. Newcrest Mining lost 29 cents at ADollars 6.50 and Placer Pacific 5 cents at ADollars 3.93. SINGAPORE took a last minute dive and the Straits Times Industrial index relinquished 9.97 to close at 2,289.84. The fall was caused mainly by a loss of 60 cents in Cycle  Carriage to SDollars 12.80, and a 30-cent retreat to SDollars 11 by Sembawang Corp. Before that, investors seemed to believe that the Federal Reserve meeting could yield at most a 50 basis-point increase in interest rates, and that this would be acceptable. MANILA combined fears of another rise in US interest rates with worries about delays in the implementation of the value added tax (VAT), which could put more pressure on the Philippine government deficit. The composite index ended 9.93 down at 2,934.27. BOMBAY, also risk-averse, fell on fears of a plague attack in western India. Following Monday's halt in trading, the BSE 30-share index lost 51.97 at 4,444.56. SEOUL registered a strong rebound in blue chips as the composite index finished 6.89 better at a new closing high of 1,052.01. In spite of the rise, declining issues outnumbered gainers by 452 to 367. KARACHI, similarly, majored on index heavyweights as the KSE 100 index rose 17.48 to 2,237.65.

SUMMARY:     This notice advises the public that a decision on the proposed South Tongue Point Land Exchange and Marine Industrial Part Development Project has been made and that the Record of Decision Document is available.                FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Benjamin Harrison, South Tongue Point EIS Team Leader, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Eastside Federal Complex, 911 NE 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 972324181 or David Blum, South Tongue Point Project Coordinator, Oregon Division of State Lands, 775 Summer Street NE., Salem, Oregon 97310.            Individuals wishing copies of this ROD should contact the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (Service) Portland Regional Office. Copies of the ROD have been sent to all agencies and individuals who previously received copies of the Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statements and to all others who have already requested copies.               DECISION:     The Service's decision is to implement the Preferred Alternative, Alternative A, as it is described in the Final EIS for the South Tongue Point Land Exchange and Marine Industrial Development Project. This decision is based on a thorough review of the alternatives and their environmental consequences.          Other Agency Decisions            A record of Decision will be produced by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). The responsible officials at the Corps will adopt the Final EIS as part of the permit process required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.        A Record of Decision will be produced by the General Services Administration (GSA). The responsible officials at GSA will adopt the EIS in order to comply with National Environmental Policy Act requirements for the disposal and exchange of Federal properties.               RATIONALE FOR DECISION:     The Preferred alternative has been selected for implementation based on consideration of a number of environmental and social factors. Alternative A has been selected as the preferred alternative because: (1) The land exchange provides the most durable means for protecting wildlife habitats and exchange wildlife populations; (2) the development component avoids significant adverse environmental impacts; and (3) the project will result in significant economic benefits in a economically depressed area.            Alternative A was selected because it balances resources protection with water dependent development. The preferred alternative provides a net benefit for wildlife and benefits for the local economy. The land exchange is the most practical means available to secure and protect additional lands from incompatible uses within the administrative boundary of the Refuge. Migratory bird and resident wildlife populations will benefit from additional secure habitat and be enhanced through wildlife management programs which could not be implemented without fee title ownership. The development component has been carefully designed to minimize adverse environmental effects. Wintering bald eagles will benefit from compensatory measures designed to enhance foraging opportunities. A net gain in wetlands will be realized through successful implementation of mitigation measures.        Implementation of the Preferred Alternative extends the protection of the environmental resources and maintenance of environmental quality beyond what would be achieved under either of the other two alternatives. Alternative B was not selected as the preferred alternative due to the significant impacts expected to resident bald eagles. Alternative C, the No Action Alternative, was not selected as the preferred alternative because it would not result in the Service increasing habitat protection within the Refuge.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:                  A. Background        In 1979, the U.S. Government declared the property known as South Tongue Point near Astoria, Oregon, to be excess to the Federal inventory. In 1981, the State of Oregon contacted the Federal Government regarding a possible exchange of property involving South Tongue Point and State-owned islands in the Columbia River.    In May 1989, the U.S. Navy contacted the Oregon Division of State Lands (Division) in regard to the possibility of homeporting mine hunter coastal vessels at South Tongue Point. At the time, the Division was studying the feasibility of acquiring South Tongue Point and developing the site as a marine industrial part in conjunction with the Federal Government's proposal to exchange property with the State of Oregon. The Navy's interest led to the development of a master plan for the marine industrial part at South Tongue Point, with the Navy as the first proposed tenant.    The GSA is proposing to convey approximately 130 acres of land at South Tongue Point near Astoria, Oregon (Section 12, T.8N., R.9W.), administered by the Corps to the State of Oregon. In exchange for the Federal land, the Division is proposing to convey approximately 3,930 acres of State-owned land within the administrative boundary of Lewis and Clark National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge), to GSA which will in turn transfer those lands to the Service. An additional 950 acres of State-owned land within the Refuge is proposed for Service management under a long-term cooperative agreement.    The State is proposing to develop a multitenant shallow draft marine industrial park moorage facility for a variety of water-dependent and general industrial uses. Water-dependent uses would have water access by means of pile-supported piers. General industrial uses would be located in upland areas without water access.

Individuals wishing copies of this ROD should contact the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (Service) Portland Regional Office. Copies of the ROD have been sent to all agencies and individuals who previously received copies of the Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statements and to all others who have already requested copies.               DECISION:     The Service's decision is to implement the Preferred Alternative, Alternative A, as it is described in the Final EIS for the South Tongue Point Land Exchange and Marine Industrial Development Project. This decision is based on a thorough review of the alternatives and their environmental consequences.          Other Agency Decisions            A record of Decision will be produced by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). The responsible officials at the Corps will adopt the Final EIS as part of the permit process required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.        A Record of Decision will be produced by the General Services Administration (GSA). The responsible officials at GSA will adopt the EIS in order to comply with National Environmental Policy Act requirements for the disposal and exchange of Federal properties.               RATIONALE FOR DECISION:     The Preferred alternative has been selected for implementation based on consideration of a number of environmental and social factors. Alternative A has been selected as the preferred alternative because: (1) The land exchange provides the most durable means for protecting wildlife habitats and exchange wildlife populations; (2) the development component avoids significant adverse environmental impacts; and (3) the project will result in significant economic benefits in a economically depressed area.            Alternative A was selected because it balances resources protection with water dependent development. The preferred alternative provides a net benefit for wildlife and benefits for the local economy. The land exchange is the most practical means available to secure and protect additional lands from incompatible uses within the administrative boundary of the Refuge. Migratory bird and resident wildlife populations will benefit from additional secure habitat and be enhanced through wildlife management programs which could not be implemented without fee title ownership. The development component has been carefully designed to minimize adverse environmental effects. Wintering bald eagles will benefit from compensatory measures designed to enhance foraging opportunities. A net gain in wetlands will be realized through successful implementation of mitigation measures.        Implementation of the Preferred Alternative extends the protection of the environmental resources and maintenance of environmental quality beyond what would be achieved under either of the other two alternatives. Alternative B was not selected as the preferred alternative due to the significant impacts expected to resident bald eagles. Alternative C, the No Action Alternative, was not selected as the preferred alternative because it would not result in the Service increasing habitat protection within the Refuge.           SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:                  A. Background        In 1979, the U.S. Government declared the property known as South Tongue Point near Astoria, Oregon, to be excess to the Federal inventory. In 1981, the State of Oregon contacted the Federal Government regarding a possible exchange of property involving South Tongue Point and State-owned islands in the Columbia River.    In May 1989, the U.S. Navy contacted the Oregon Division of State Lands (Division) in regard to the possibility of homeporting mine hunter coastal vessels at South Tongue Point. At the time, the Division was studying the feasibility of acquiring South Tongue Point and developing the site as a marine industrial part in conjunction with the Federal Government's proposal to exchange property with the State of Oregon. The Navy's interest led to the development of a master plan for the marine industrial part at South Tongue Point, with the Navy as the first proposed tenant.    The GSA is proposing to convey approximately 130 acres of land at South Tongue Point near Astoria, Oregon (Section 12, T.8N., R.9W.), administered by the Corps to the State of Oregon. In exchange for the Federal land, the Division is proposing to convey approximately 3,930 acres of State-owned land within the administrative boundary of Lewis and Clark National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge), to GSA which will in turn transfer those lands to the Service. An additional 950 acres of State-owned land within the Refuge is proposed for Service management under a long-term cooperative agreement.    The State is proposing to develop a multitenant shallow draft marine industrial park moorage facility for a variety of water-dependent and general industrial uses. Water-dependent uses would have water access by means of pile-supported piers. General industrial uses would be located in upland areas without water access.             "
0,FT933-13605 ,"FT933-13605 _AN-DGSCZAABFT 930719   FT  19 JUL 93 / Doubts over effectiveness of Japan-style work practices      By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff   PENT-UP resentment from British workers over the imposition of Japanese-style working practices could have a 'devastating effect' on industry as the recovery continues, according to a report commissioned by the government and due to be published tomorrow. The review of the influence of Japanese companies on UK labour practices finds 'little evidence that Japanese-style international competitiveness can be achieved in Britain by copying some, or even most, Japanese working methods'. It also raises questions about the effect of having to 'work as hard as humanly possible' on the quality of employees' lives. The study, conducted for the Department of Employment by Industrial Relations Services, an independent pay and conditions research group, says British manufacturers are using the threat of Japanese competition to push through reforms in working practices. The report's author, Ms Sue Milsome, says this tack has proved more persuasive than the more accurate 'but less compelling' argument that 'competitive pressures demand changes in working and management practices'. Labour law reforms and the recession have probably had more influence on working methods in Britain than the example of companies like Nissan, she says. The report warns that the introduction of some working methods favoured by Japanese companies could increase British industry's vulnerability. For example, 'just-in-time' production means companies do not keep buffer stocks. A sudden stoppage by workers could mean immediate lay-offs in other plants, as happened during the 1988 Ford strike, the report also says. It warns: 'At some point . . . the British economy will recover. If there is a great deal of pent-up resentment against Japanese-style working practices, and the fragility of production systems has been increased . . . worker dissatisfaction leading to industrial action could have a devastating effect.' The study also points to the current debate in Japan over karoshi - death through overwork. Karoshi, it says, is mainly as a result of the large amounts of unpaid overtime performed by Japanese workers. It concludes that the Japanese economic miracle, which has so impressed western observers, is probably coming to an end. 'It may be that Japan's employment practices, in particular, will be jettisoned as Japan becomes a mature economy, so British employers should be wary of imitating practices that are only appropriate in a climate of ever-increasing growth.' The impact of Japanese firms on working and employment practices in British manufacturing industry. Industrial Relations Services, 18-20 Highbury Place, London N5 1QP.

Although the monitoring started on 1 January, it was  increased on 21 February. The Army has continued to intercept  and record EZLN short-wave radio communications in the jungle,  the mountains, and the city.    Communications were intercepted and the exact position of  the  EZLN delegates and Subcommander Marcos at the cathedral during  the peace talks were pinpointed with laser sound-wave emission  and reception systems, high-sensitivity microphones, and a  satellite. Using this same system, Military Intelligence  monitored the EZLN delegates' private conversations, their  plans, and decisions.    A high-ranking Mexican Army officer, who asked to remain  unnamed for security reasons, confirmed these monitoring  actions. ""Not even Camacho himself is aware that we know  everything he said. We know everything. What the Zapatists  thought is the only thing we still do not know,"" he said. The  officer said that Military Intelligence installed a  sound-tracking system using high communications technology  imported from the United States.    With the aid of a map of the Cathedral of Peace and a laser  system, the Army pinpointed the living quarters of the EZLN  delegates and Subcommander Marcos, as well as the dining and  meeting areas. ""Sound waves reached us via a laser that was  inside the Cathedral. The laser beam captured sounds, words,  phrases, and entire conversations, and relayed them back to us,""  he said.    During an interview with the officer, he detailed the  Military Intelligence's tracking and monitoring systems. The  Cathedral of Peace was the monitoring target. That is where  negotiations were held beginning on 21 February between Peace  Commissioner Camacho, 18 EZLN delegates, Subcommander Marcos,  and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz.    By tracking the Cathedral by satellite, Military  Intelligence  located the living areas, the delegates, Subcommander Marcos, as  well as the security personnel. The officer added that there are  still temporary military ""bases"" in San Cristobal de las Casas  and the 31st Military Zone. He said there are boards with radio  communication sets, scanners, and telephones at these bases.  Other boards hold laser beam systems, parabolic antennas,  monitoring and reading systems, and microphone recording systems  called ""small birds,"" which read sounds from inside the  Cathedral.    Four Military Intelligence members work 24-hour shifts at  each base. They wear earphones and are in constant  communications with the main base. The information is gathered  with the high-sensitivity systems. The military prepares a daily  report on the conversations monitored and sends it to the 7th  Military Region in Tuxtla Gutierrez. The same report is sent to  National Defense Secretary Antonio Riviera Bazan.    The monitors receive sound waves at the monitoring stations,  the location of which the officer failed to mention. ""The  systems currently in use and during the talks include very  sophisticated microphones planted in the outer walls of the  Cathedral of Peace. They are very well concealed. They pick up  information through the walls,"" he said. ""The only way we could  not listen would be if the walls were covered with lead. The  laser beam could not penetrate them then and magnetic waves  could not pass through.""    The Mexican Army's actions are carried out clandestinely. A  cease-fire and the suspension of military actions were agreed  upon by the EZLN and the commissioner to begin the negotiations.    Espionage Activities    In addition to espionage activities aimed at taping private  conversations and negotiations between the delegates and  Subcommander Marcos, they also scan EZLN communications in the  jungle and mountains and from there to the Zapatist  communications center in San Cristobal de las Casas.    Even before 1 January, the EZLN had been using a short-wave  radio system of clandestine radio communications. Military  Intelligence intercepted these EZLN classified conversations.  They currently have a file with cassettes including  conversations revealing their codes, locations, and activities.  EL NORTE was able to obtain some of the cassettes taped by the  military. Officially, these activities ""do not take place"", just  like these cassettes ""do not exist."" The cassettes procured by  EL NORTE were forwarded, along with others, to the 7th Military  Region. Each of the cassettes are numbered and carry the date  when they were taped. Approximately three cassettes carrying  Zapatist conversations are taped daily.    Taped Messages    Some of the taped messages say: ""Copy... we must go to the  watch tower... pending the saints and check on the men with the  large hats"" [Copiado ... hay que ir al mirador... pendiente de  los santos y checar a los sombrerudos]. Some of the cassettes  examined by EL NORTE's correspondent includes several codes  indicating the names of bases, leaders, and information  exchanges as well as cattle rustling activities and even the 18  February arrangements to transport the Zapatist delegates to the  cathedral. Most of the messages are either in tzeltal or tzotzil  [Indian dialects], with a few in Spanish.    Some of the conversations taped include events like the  CNDH's [National Human Rights Committee] visit to several  Zapatist regions, the presence of reporters, and some EZLN  activities. There are also talks on changing clandestine  communications channels and cattle rustling activities.    These are some EZLN conversations taped by Military  Intelligence and transcribed by EL NORTE:    1. ""They were beaten up or something like that, over. I  am being asked if they can go ahead with the preparation of the  record even if it is for its sake, over...    2. Affirmative, but together with the CNDH.    1. Copy...    2. Together with a copy, and send that bastard with the  milk because they left and the only thing you know about is the  presence of the federales.    1. Send the big ears over there. If possible, try to  brand them. At the house of the big hats, there are cots,  refrigerators. Take all you need since you can use them. I do  not know how many can come over here either.    2. I do not know, copy.    1. Come on Thursday. Well, if you can make it on Friday,  it is to stay.    2. Buffalo says to go to crab [cangrejo]. They had the  contract. We were the only ones to fail, but he knows why. I am  going to send someone to represent me. You are going to have a  talk with the contractor and he is going to tell you what he  needs.    2. Copy.    1. If you know that the number of the base, try to get it  out of him.    2. If you are hungry just get a hold of a big ears. There  are salt bags there, use them.    Codes -- big ears mean cattle, buffalo is the EZLN leader,  Zapatist soldiers are known as workers, and maseca which means  base -- are part of the communications system. According to the  taped conversations, the Zapatist bases are identified by names  of saints and EZLN operations are coordinated by contractors.    Marcos: We Were Already Aware    At one of the EZLN camps located in the jungle, Subcommander  Marcos pointed out that they were already aware of Military  Intelligence surveillance. ""We knew we were being taped and  spied on during the dialogue and that is why we took some  precautions. We, as well as the mediator, were aware they were  taping our conversations and everything else we said in private  with the commissioner,"" the subcommander said. ""We are also  aware that intercepting our communications right now is contrary  to the cease-fire and contrary to what they say is a search for  peace."" As a result of the eavesdropping, the subcommander  indicated that they began to modify their codes as well as  taking other measures.     "

The Nikkei 225 rose 434.34 to 19,393.94 as the yen fell to the Y105 level on continued buying of the dollar by the Bank of Japan. The index registered a day's low of 18,826.68 in the morning before rising to a high of 19,415.14 in the afternoon on index-linked buying. However, some analysts were ambivalent over a continued rise in share prices. 'There is not much significance in the rise, since volume was so low,' said Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel. He thought that the yen would not weaken much further, and that it could remain at current levels for at least another month until a decisive breakthrough was made on trade talks between the US and Japan. Volume was 220m shares, against Friday's 265m. In spite of a sense of relief over the yen's weakening, most investors remained inactive. Large-lot buying by foreign investors, seen during the past month, was also absent. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 12.85 at 1,569.96 and the Nikkei 300 added 2.55 at 290.51. Advances overwhelmed declines by 661 to 327, with 188 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.69 to 1,307.11. Arbitrage buying supported bank shares. Industrial Bank of Japan improved Y10 to Y3,200 and Sakura Bank moved ahead Y20 to Y1,470. The yen's decline supported export-oriented high-technology shares. Sony advanced Y80 to Y6,110 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y20 to Y1,720. Toyota Motor was also strong, rising Y60 to Y1,930, while Honda Motor appreciated Y40 to Y1,660. Telecommunications-related stocks gained ground, with buying focused on the multi-media theme. Nitsuko, the most active issue of the day, climbed Y70 to Y1,410 and Fujitsu Y26 to Y1,010. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone added Y14,000 at Y914,000. Sega Enterprises fell Y60 to Y7,220 on continued pessimism over its earnings following a downward revision in profits last Friday. Pioneer Electronic slipped Y10 to Y2,570. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 168.20 to 21,264.40 in volume of 41.3m shares. Roundup There were mixed performances from the region's markets yesterday, although Hong Kong's decline was almost mirrored in Australia. HONG KONG closed sharply lower on institutional selling. The Hang Seng index fell by 369.43, or 3.4 per cent, to 10,456.45. Turnover slipped to HKDollars 4.3bn from Friday's HKDollars 4.7bn. Profit-taking was evident in the banking sector, where HSBC Holdings surrendered HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 116 and Hang Seng Bank receded HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 70.50. The property sub-index dropped 791, or 4 per cent, to 18,616, with Cheung Kong declining HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 43 and Sun Hung Kai Properties retreating HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 58. AUSTRALIA was dragged down by sharp falls overseas and weaker futures and bonds, and fell 2 per cent to its lowest level in a month, the All Ordinaries index finishing 44.7 down at 2,178.5. Worst hit were media and some resource stocks, particularly coal. News Corp fell 40 cents to ADollars 10.08 and the Nine Network 8 cents to ADollars 5.84 as the media index weakened 3.1 per cent. SINGAPORE moved cautiously higher, with many investors remaining absent ahead of tomorrow's budget. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 16.60 to 2,350.87. SEOUL moved upwards for the third consecutive session, helped by activity in blue chip issues, and the composite index added 13.07 at 946.00. Kepco, the electricity utility, and Posco, the steel manufacturer, gained Won800 and Won2,000 respectively at Won31,100 and Won64,200. TAIWAN eased back in the lowest day's volume seen so far this year. The weighted index receded 29.93 to 5,783.89 in turnover of TDollars 42.2bn. MANILA declined in late trading, influenced by the fall in Hong Kong and a setback in PLDT in New York on Friday. The Manila composite index shed 39.8 to 3,005.6 in turnover of 779m pesos, compared with Friday's 1.3bn pesos. PLDT, which lost Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 74 5/8 in New York on Friday, dropped 1.4 per cent to 2,140 pesos. JAKARTA fell 2 per cent, blaming overall bearish sentiment and increasing foreign sell orders as the JKSE index dipped a further 11.02 to 543.76. KARACHI anticipated more foreign buying as it rose on government incentives for the energy sector, the KSE-100 index closing 26.86 stronger at 2,375.41. BOMBAY climbed 5.5 per cent, the BSE index ending 214.48 higher at 4,129.52 in expectation of further economic reforms, including fiscal concessions to industry in the national budget next Monday. Brokers said that budget rumours included a reduction in corporate taxes, the raising of tax limits on individual incomes and full convertibil-ity for the rupee on current account.

That is, Yamaguchi is a compact  combination of all the elements found throughout Japan. It has  mountains, forests, and seas, including the Japan Sea and the  Inland Sea. It has both beach and ski resorts. It has farms as  well as fishing villages and fishery combines. It possesses  various industries in all fields, ranging from textiles, iron  and steel, chemicals, and petroleum, to electrical machinery,  machines, automobiles, and semiconductors.    The scale of the prefecture is also about medium among all  the prefectures and metropolitan areas, with a population of  1,560,000, ranking 25th in the nation. The total production in  the prefecture is 4,467 billion, ranking 23rd in the nation.    The living environment of Yamaguchi Prefecture is especially  outstanding. It is a world far distant from the urban commuter  hell, and daily life is filled with a beauty of nature that  cannot be experienced in the big cities. For example, it takes  only three minutes to walk from my house to the river where  fireflies abound, and whichever town or city you visit in the  prefecture, the amount of green that one sees is completely  different than in Tokyo or Osaka. The roads in the prefecture  are in excellent condition,and traffic congestion is rare, so it  takes about one hour to travel from the capital, Yamaguchi city,  to any location in the prefecture, and everywhere one can easily  get in touch with nature.    As everyone knows, the Meiji Restoration, which constituted  the beginning of modern Japan had its origins in Yamaguchi. Even  now, the remains of the warriors of the Choshu clan are found in  many locations throughout the prefecture, beginning with Hagi,  and one can sense in daily conversations that the sense of pride  of the Choshu warrior resides in the consciousness of the  prefecture's citizens.    Thus one has the opportunity to come in frequent contact  with  good points of Japan and her people that cannot be sensed in  Tokyo.    In every Japanese industry from now on, no matter in which  field, display of creativity will be of major importance, and  the source of this creativity is people. Such people will first  be able to display their creativity if they are placed in a  living environment such as that of Yamaguchi, which abounds in  ``prosperity and riches.''    Yamaguchi, The Industrial Prefecture.    Yamaguchi has followed the typical pattern of growth of  industry in modern Japan up to the present time. During the  policy of industrial growth of the Meiji Period, the first  cement plants were constructed. Before the war, there was a navy  depot, and the prefecture was a base for supplying the military  in shipbuilding, coal, and fuel oil production. After the war,  the prefecture, being on the western end of Honshu in the  Pacific Belt Zone, contributed greatly to the economic growth of  our country, forming a large coastal complex centered in the  Shunan area, and served as a major base for our country's  chemical and heavy industries.    In 1964, the Shunan Region was designated as a special zone  for establishing industry, and Yamaguchi Prefecture, along with  the Ube and Onoda regions, where cement manufacturing and  chemical industries have flourished, and Shimonoseki, where  shipbuilding has predominated, have taken the lead in the growth  pattern for Japan's economy, and has firmly established the  image of an industrial prefecture. During the first and second  oil shocks, it was severely impacted, and much time was needed  for recovery. In recent years, in order to raise the level of  industrial structure, it has made great efforts to attract  processing and assembly industries and the most modern of plants  are now in operation producing semiconductors, automobiles, and  the like.    However, as before, it still relies greatly on chemical and  heavy industries such as chemicals, steel and oil, and has  tended to lag behind in transforming its industrial structure.  The weight of industrial shipments in the country has dropped  from two percent at the time of the second oil shock to  currently about 1.5 percent. Consequently, it is very desirable  for Yamaguchi to regain its authority as an industrial  prefecture by raising further the level of its industrial  infrastructure.    Towards Establishing Yamaguchi as a Technology Prefecture    In our view, the key to restoring authority to Yamaguchi as  an industrial center lies in technology. Since receiving  acceptance of the plan for a technopolis in Ube in 1984, an  all-out effort has been under way to develop high-level  technology and industry based on this plan and at present, on  the basis of the second phase of the development plan approved  for 1992, we are establishing Ube New City as a core strategic  base. Even the Fourth Long Range Prospectus for Development of  the Prefecture, compiled in 1988, called for plans for a  high-technology belt, and assigned first priority to making  technology the nucleus of development of the prefecture. Of  special note as one implementation of the development plans for  the prefecture, we must cite the establishment of the Japan  Ultra-High Temperature Materials Research Institute (JUTEMI) and  Japan Ultra-High Temperature Materials Center (JUTEM).    The center and the institute received funding for a  Mechanism  for Development of New Energy and Industrial Technology based on  the Improvement of RD Infrastructure Law and began  operation in  April 1992 receiving funding also from regional public  corporations in Yamaguchi and Gifu prefectures and from private  corporations. They have attracted a world authority in this  field, professor emeritus Ryohei Tanaka of the Tokyo Institute  of Technology. They offer outstanding, world-class test  environments for studying new materials under ultra high  temperatures.    Our mission is to have it grow as a focal point for  research,  emanating from Yamaguchi, extending out to the world at large.  While we have made substantial progress in developing the  center, general awareness of it is low, so we are concentrating  on seeing just how to publicize it and plan for increasing its  utilization. In order to establish and cultivate sophisticated  urban service industries that will contribute to development of  a high-level industrial infrastructure, we were authorized to  develop a ``brain center'' concept in June 1992, and we are  currently engaged in implementing the plan. Also, in order to  place a major emphasis on cultivating local human resources in  software, we are constructing an optoelectronics software park,  pursuant to the regional software law    This is the tenth year since Yamaguchi was designated by the  Technopolis Law.    In March of this year, we formulated a basic plan for  technology development for the prefecture, with a view towards  the year 2000 (the Intertech Yamaguchi Plan), based on the  realization that technology-centered industrial development will  reach its second stage, which will be a large step forward.    According to this scheme, we will establish a concrete base  for developing technology in the hardware area, and a creative  core technology for the prefecture in the software area. We are  thus aiming at raising the level of technology in Yamaguchi  prefecture as a whole, by promoting technology exchange that  focuses on the industry-wide dimension, using this as leverage  to establish a high-level industrial infrastructure. We also  wish to create long-term employment opportunities, emphasizing  our young people in particular.    We are just now beginning to evaluate, on the basis of this  conception, how we should basically provide for and complete the  existing industrial technology centers in the prefecture in  order to create a core technology base for the prefecture.    At the same time, we are making great efforts to promote the  science and engineering that form the foundations for industrial  technology. The Yamaguchi Prefecture Council for the Promotion  of Science and Technology, whose members include Dr. Heisuke  Hironaka of our prefecture, is currently formulating a policy  for promotion of science and technology in the prefecture. We  have established a regional foundation for the promotion of  science and technology and using this as a basic source we have  established a prize for the promotion of science and technology  and are also vigorously supporting basic scientific RD. We  are  also fully aware that one major issue is to determine just how  we can, through exchanges among the corporations, skilfully  utilize the very high level of accomplishments in technology and  technical personnel possessed by the large corporations in our  prefecture in order to raise the levels of small businesses.  Currently, we are providing various kinds of support emphasizing  mainly technology development projects, in such places as the  Shunan Regional and Local Industrial Promotion Center, and the  Yamaguchi-Bofu Center for Promotion of Industrial Arts and Local  Industries.    In particular, in order to form a high quality technology  complex consisting of regional small businesses with high  technical sophistication, to support them in venturing into new  fields, we are in the process of implementing as a management  resource the Plan for the Activation of the Shunan Regional  Small Business Complex, which was approved on 31 March of this  year.    We are deeply involved in a project for constructing of a  town built of new materials aimed at producing an environment  that will make it easy for machine parts manufacturers that  provide technical support to industries to manifest their  creativity. and in a project to construct large-scale, high  standard industrial parks that are appropriate to industrial  activity in this age of technology. In this fashion, we are  striving hard to establish Yamaguchi as a Technology Prefecture  and in Yamaguchi, we have the Engineering Department of  Yamaguchi University which boasts a the largest enrollment of  new students in the Chuubu-Shikoku area numbering 640. Soon the  Yamaguchi Junior College Branch of The Science University of  Tokyo will become a four-year institution. We also have  educational institutions such as the industrial high schools in  Ube and Tokuyama, which are very well equipped for technology  education. By aggressively strengthening collaboration among  industry, government, and academia we wish to promote the  development of industry based on these technologies.     "

The  practice of transforming operating mechanisms or establishing a  modern enterprise system encapsulates the second section of the  ""Decision"" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee: We should advance enterprise-related work and  enterprise reform on all fronts, and all state enterprises  should effectively implement the ""Regulations Governing the  Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial  Enterprises"" and the soon-to-be-promulgated ""Regulations on the  Supervision and Management of Property in State-Owned  Enterprises,"" focus on changing their operating mechanisms, and  create conditions and lay the groundwork for establishing a  modern enterprise system. The numbers ""10,000, 1,000, 100, and  10"" give concrete expression to achieving breakthroughs in key  areas in the current enterprise reform. This means achieving  breakthroughs in key areas to promote overall reform through the  pioneering role of some enterprises and through supplementary  reform in some cities. The number ""10,000"" undergirds this  effort.    The number ""10,000"" means fully granting approximately  10,000  state enterprises the 14 types of operational rights which  enterprises are supposed to enjoy according to the ""Regulations  Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned  Industrial Enterprises."" It also means making great efforts to  realize the transformation of operating mechanisms, effectively  implementing the ""two sets of rules,"" and completing the  appraisal of fixed assets and working capital, so as to lay a  solid foundation for establishing a modern enterprise system and  for advancing toward the market. This is completely consistent  with the goal set by the State Council of increasing the  proportion of well-run large and medium state enterprises from  one-third to two-thirds by the end of the ""Eighth Five-Year  Plan.""    In implementing the ""Regulations Governing the Change of  Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,"" we  should mainly carry out four tasks: 1) Promulgating and  implementing supplementary rules and regulations; 2) continuing  to intensify publicity efforts, investigating and dealing with  cases in which the ""Regulations Governing the Change of  Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises"" are  violated and retaliatory action is taken against enterprises,  and exposing those cases in the news media or even investigating  legal responsibilities; 3) continuing to promote the  transformation of governmental functions, granting enterprises  operational rights, and accelerating the reform of government  bodies; and 4) encouraging enterprises to turn inward, combine  their operational rights and responsibilities, and use the  rights at their disposal to transform their operating  mechanisms. To carry out these tasks, we should focus on  granting enterprises the right to independently conduct export  trade and to refuse to share financial charges, improve  procedures for examining and approving applications for  permission to independently conduct export and import trade  through simplified formalities and greater efficiency. We  should allow enterprises, which have been granted the right to  independently conduct the export and import trade, to enjoy the  same power as foreign trade enterprises in terms of export  licenses and quotas. We should consider the effort to halt the  practice of collecting unwarranted fees an important aspect of  the anticorruption struggle. All localities and businesses  should formulate specific measures in light of their actual  conditions to halt the practice, publish those measures, and  allow enterprises to oversee the implementation of those  measures. We should make active efforts to create conditions,  and guide and assist enterprises in instituting self-control  mechanisms so they will operate in accordance with the law and  assume responsibility for their own profits and losses and for  preserving and increasing the value of state assets. This year,  all localities and departments should uncover and nurture a  number of exemplary enterprises which have successfully changed  their operating mechanisms, and which are well-managed and  efficient, and they should sum up and promote the advanced  experiences of these enterprises.  In implementing the ""two sets of rules,"" we also should  primarily carry out four tasks: 1) Further tracking,  ascertaining, and correctly understanding the situation, and  promoting the implementation of the ""two sets of rules"" and the  Finance Ministry's ""Circular on the Question of Harmonizing  Policies on Implementing the New Enterprise Financial System"";  2) Aligning the ""two sets of rules"" with the ""Interim  Regulations on Enterprise Income Tax"" and other new tax codes,  and promptly addressing the common problems of enterprises in  implementing the new tax system; 3) Continuing to perfect the  enterprise financial and accounting system in accordance with  the demands of the ""Company Law"" and the new tax system; and 4)  Actively searching for a management accounting system with  Chinese characteristics that meets the demands of a modern  enterprise system.    Enterprises should perfect their cost accounting system,  enhance their capacity for continued development, and ensure  that the value of state assets is preserved and increased.  Backbone state enterprises which can cope with the situation  may quicken the pace of depreciation after obtaining approval to  do so. To the extent permitted by state policies, state  enterprises may raise money through various channels to  supplement their capital, and wholly state-owned enterprises,  which have been around for a long time and which will be exempt  from delivering their after-tax profits to the state in the near  future, may increase their common reserve funds and public  welfare funds with the surplus money in accordance with the ""two  sets of rules.""    During this year's appraisal of fixed assets and working  capital, we should bring 10,000 large and medium state  enterprises within the scope of our appraisal, and these include  pilot enterprises that will implement the system of appointed  supervisory boards and the modern enterprise system, all state  enterprises in the 10 cities designated for experimenting with  the practice of ""optimizing the capital structure and  invigorating enterprises,"" and two-thirds of large and medium  enterprises in all localities whose fixed assets and working  capital have not been appraised. We should take care to  coordinate efforts and solve problems in the course of  implementation to ensure that the task of appraising fixed  assets and working capital is completed with good qualitative  and quantitative results. Along with the transformation of  governmental functions, we should improve our work in appraising  fixed assets and working capital and give full rein to the roles  of certified public accountants, registered auditors, and other  intermediary agencies in society.    The plan for ""transforming the operating mechanisms of or  establishing a modern enterprise system in 10,000 large and  medium state enterprises, 1,000 key enterprises, 100 different  types of large and medium state enterprises, and enterprises in  10 cities or prefectures"" is a new concept for improving large  and medium state enterprises in the new situation. We should  seriously study and publicize the ""Decision"" of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  ""Company Law,"" and increase our understanding of the importance,  urgency, and arduousness of changing the operating mechanisms of  state enterprises and of establishing a modern enterprise  system. The principal leaders of economic and trade commissions  in all localities should concentrate on undertaking meticulous  efforts, organizationally and in terms of leadership; they  should devote painstaking and major efforts to tracking the way  the ""two sets of rules"" are implemented in 10,000 large and  medium state enterprises so as to make substantial progress this  year.

0,FT931-831 ,"FT931-831 _AN-DC1AGADSFT 930327   FT  27 MAR 93 / Markets: Investors find silver cloud's dark lining - Wall Street      By NIKKI TAIT   LOW INTEREST rates and a recovering economy are what every stock market likes best. Wall Street has both at present, in fairly ample measure. But even the sunniest situation will have its share of shadows, and this week the political upheavals in Russia cast a prolonged cloud across US stock markets. For the first three days of the week, share prices generally moved lower, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall to around the 3,445-mark on Wednesday night. That was some 26 points below the previous Friday's close. There was a certain amount of logic behind the concerns. If President Boris Yeltsin was replaced by hardliners, ran the reasoning, cutbacks in US military expenditure would probably be postponed and the Clinton Administration's economic package would be jeopardy. But the reasoning ran a little thin in places, and the overall impression was of a market reacting more to the threat of uncertainty, than to specific, delineated dangers. It is also worth noting that the market was standing at near-record levels going into the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its all-time closing high on March 10, when it peaked at 3,478.34, and when the week's trading began on Monday morning, it was still standing at 3,471.58. In a market that has enjoyed a good rally, the scope for little nervousness is that much greater. Still, by the end of the week, Boris Yeltsin was still walking his tightrope, and Wall Street responded at first enthusiastically and then with a little more care. As moves to impeach Yeltsin looked increasingly unlikely on Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15.94 points, recouping much the losses seen earlier in the week, while the more broadly-based Standard  Poor's 500-stock index showed a 2.82-point advance to 450.88. But at the opening on Friday, the advance was a modest five points and traders were warning that a sagging bond market, fearful that interest rates may edge higher, plus continued volatility in the international arena, could curtail the market's upward momentum. The main corporate story of the week - the move of Louis Gerstner from the chairmanship of RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco group, to International Business Machines, the computer behemoth - had muted stock market implications. RJR Nabisco, which is in the throes of a complex 'targeted stock scheme' and a Dollars 1.5bn capital raising exercise, acted quickly to realign its management structure, filling Gerstner's shoes without introducing new blood. Its shares, clouded by all the difficulties currently surrounding tobacco stocks, remained at the Dollars 8 level. IBM shares showed a little more reaction. They fell early in the week, but this was attributed as much to pricing pressures on the group's mainframe business and the spill-over effect from the profits warning by Amdahl, another US computer systems company. On news that the intensely-watch management issue had been finally resolved, IBM shares gained Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 51 5/8. The situation in the pharmaceuticals sector was a lot less happy. Shares of many mainline drug makers - already under pressure for months - tumbled again, when Merck announced its first-ever job reduction programme. Cutbacks in the automotive, defence and aerospace industry have been on a much larger scale than Merck's decision to cut 1,000 jobs. The New Jersey-based drug company blamed the situation on the increasingly competitive environment in the US, and the worldwide effort to contain healthcare costs. It also said that the impact of this deteriorating environment would tell on its first quarter results, and analysts scaled back their expectations. Merck's shares fell sharply, down Dollars 2 1/4 to a 52-week low of Dollars 34 3/4 on Wednesday, but the damage was more widespread than this. Pfizer lost Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 57 5/8, Schering-Plough tumbled Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars Dollars 56 1/2, Glaxo slumped Dollars  3/8 to a year-low of Dollars 17 5/8, Bristol-Myers Squibb eased Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 57 7/8, and so on. The drug manufacturers have had more than their fair share of worries but another ailing industry - the US airline sector - saw a rare gleam of light in mid-week. Airline stocks rallied across the board, and helped account for a gain of over 20 points in the Dow Jones transportation average on Tuesday. The reasons were various: the national commission set up to examine the industry's problems was formally approved by the House of Representatives, domestic traffic looks more healthy, and the savage price-wars which devastated the industry's fortunes last year have abated.  ----------------------------- Monday      3463.48 -  8.1 Tuesday     3461.83 -  1.62 Wednesday   3445.38 - 16.48 Thursday    3461.32 + 15.94 Friday      3439.98 - 21.34  -----------------------------   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Gorbatkina, All-Russian  Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining and  Angarsknefteorgsintez Production Association; UDC  66.097.3:665.654.2]    [Abstract] Zeolites with a pentacyl structure, such as  TsVK, TsVM, TsVM, and ultrasil, are the main catalysts used in  hydrodeparaffinization or selective hydrocracking of n-paraffin  hydrocarbons. To produce high-quality transformer oils from  paraffin raw materials, these catalysts must possess not only a  high splitting activity but also a sufficient hydrogenating  activity. Most hydrogenating heterogeneous catalysts contain  either noble or rare earth metals or else group VI metals.  Catalysts containing a nickel-molybdenum complex have a higher  hydrogenating activity than do catalysts into which metals have  been added by coextrusion or impregnation. Deposition of a  nickel-molybdenum complex on solid carriers (aluminosilicates or  zeolites) helps increase their hydrogenating activity and thus  helps decrease the content of hydrogenating metals in the  catalyst. A catalyst's isomerizing activity and its ability to  redistribute hydrogen (thereby reducing the yield of unsaturated  compounds) increases in the presence of small quantities of  wide-pore zeolites (mordenite or ultrastable Y). Tungsten helps  increase a catalyst's hydrogenating activity in relation to  polycyclic aromatic compounds, and zinc and chromium reduce  metals' migration and thereby increase their dispersion and the  stability of a catalyst's operation. Zinc facilitates  aromatization of paraffins, and chromium compounds possess an  independent hydrogenating activity. These and other laws were  used to develop a new catalyst, SGK-5, which is designed to  replace the combination SGK-1 plus type AKM hydrogenating  catalyst. SGK-5 contains nickel and molybdenum as its  hydrogenating components. SGK-5 is simpler to use than the SGK-1  + AKM combination; however, it has not been possible to fully  hydrogenate unsaturated compounds in the presence of SGK-5  (despite the fact that it has a higher hydrogenating activity  than the SGK-1 + AKM combination). For this reason, studies were  undertaken to increase the hydrogenating activity of SGK-5.  Eight different versions of SGK-5 were produced and compared.  The comparative tests established that catalysts containing 16  to 20 percent (wt) nickel-molybdenum complex have a high  hydrogenating activity coupled with a high yield of target  fraction. When the nickel-molybdenum complex exceeds 20 percent,  the zeolite content decreases, which has an unfavorable effect  on the product pour point. Catalysts based on type TsVN zeolite  were found to result in a target fraction with a low pour point.  Type TsVM-III zeolite and wide-pore zeolites resulted in  somewhat of an elevation of the product pour point; however, the  addition of dealuminized mordenite had a favorable effect on  yield of the target fraction. Roasting just at 340ëC did not  result in adequate activation of the zeolite component of the  catalyst or (consequently) the necessary product pour point.  Staged roasting at 340 and 500ëC proved optimum. Tables 2;  references 18: 14 Russian, 4 Western.     "

Much of the increase was accounted for by about 600 cases brought by domestic staff against four Northern Ireland health boards, claiming equal pay with porters. Overall, almost 90 per cent of the applications involved just six employers. The study found that the average wait for cases to be determined by tribunals is just less than 17 months, although cases can take much longer. Two cases settled last year, both without the need for a tribunal ruling, took almost four years and six years to resolve. Long waits reflect the complexity of the legislation. The Equal Opportunities Commission has argued that existing equal pay and sex discrimination legislation should be replaced by a single, more simple act. The principle of equal pay for equal value means that an individual can claim equal pay with someone of the opposite sex, even if they are in a different post in the organisation, if it can be argued that the work makes equal demands. There were 1,313 applications on those grounds last year - the most since 1987, the study found. Equal Opportunities Review No 44, July/August 1992.

This  resulted in the clinching of a deal for 798 smuggled automobiles  which passed the border with no trouble. In order to defray the  costs of the transaction, the Qinzhou Commodities Corporation  Head Office and the Beihai Industrial Supply and Marketing  Corporation actively raised money, and entrusted Chen Zuheng  before the case was discovered to collect in succession eight  sums of money totalling more than $11.2 million and deliver them  to Ning's Yisheng Corporation in Hong Kong.    After the case was discovered, they also mutually colluded,  and continued to falsely create automobile original  manufacturing site documentary materials, and provide false  information on nature of their trading, to conceal their  smuggling.    The ""798"" smuggled automobiles case caused the country  tremendous economic loss. In November of 1993, the Guangxi  District Discipline Committee and the Supervisory Office  conducted a rigorous investigation of the entire case. The four  people involved, including Pei Yuchun et al., have been expelled  from the party and administrative disciplinary measures have  been taken against them. Because of their violations of the law,  the case has been handed over to judicial organs for  investigation. Others bearing major responsibility have also  been punished through expulsion from their posts in the party,  placement on probation within the party, and some have been  relieved of their administrative positions.

ACTION:     Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review and partial termination.                 SUMMARY:     In response to a request by a petitioner, the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan. The review covers four firms and the period April 18, 1991, through August 31, 1992. The review indicates the existence of margins for the firms.        As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between United States price and foreign market value.    Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.            EFFECTIVE DATE:     February 1, 1994.            FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Todd Peterson or Thomas Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 4824195 or 4823814, respectively.        Background        On September 20, 1991, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan (56 FR 47737). The Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' on September 11, 1992 (57 FR 41725). On September 21, 1992, the petitioner, Consolidated International Automotive, Inc. (Consolidated), requested that we conduct an administrative review for the period April 18, 1991, through August 31, 1992. We published a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'' on October 22, 1992 (57 FR 48202), announcing an administrative review of King Kong Corporation, San Shin Hardware Works Co., Ltd. (San Shin), Gourmet Equipment (Taiwan) Corporation (Gourmet), Chu Fong Metallic Industrial Corporation (Chu Fong), and San Chien Electric Industrial Works, Ltd. (San Chien).    On January 8, 1993, the petitioner withdrew its request for review of San Shin. Therefore, we are terminating the review. We were unable to identify an address for King Kong Corporation. We sent questionnaires to Gourmet, Chu Fong, and San Chien. We received a response from Gourmet and conducted a verification at Gourmet's office September 22, 1993, through September 26, 1993.    On May 26, 1993, the petitioner alleged middleman dumping of the subject merchandise. Based on information compiled during the review process, the Department determined to apply best information available (BIA) to Gourmet and the two non-respondents. Therefore, the Department did not initiate a middleman dumping investigation (see Use of BIA, Middleman dumping allegation, and Transhipment allegation memos to Holly Kuga, Director, Office of Antidumping Compliance).    On June 11, 1993, the petitioner alleged that the respondent was shipping the subject merchandise through Canada to the United States. We examined data provided by the U.S. Customs Service which showed no evidence that the Canadian buyer resold the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of review (POR) (see Use of BIA, Middleman dumping allegation, and Transhipment allegation memo to Holly Kuga, Director, Office of Antidumping Compliance).    The Department has now conducted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).

The leading 225-issue index fell 67.70 to 20,357.94 after a day's high of 20,379.74 and a low of 20,244.82, barely changed on the week. The yen's rise to a record Y103 level against the dollar in overseas markets, also kept investors away. Volume totaled 200m shares against 238m. Arbitrageurs were seen placing small lot buy orders. Declines led advances by 611 to 307, with 224 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 7.23 to 1,654.59 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 67.7 to close at 20357.94. Traders said that overseas investors remained buyers of financial stocks, especially trust banks, which are considered to be laggards among bank issues. 'The stocks are fundamentally risky, and we expect a shift away from the stocks in about a month,' said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson International. Mitsui Trust and Banking rose Y20 to Y1,260 and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking advanced Y10 to Y1,420. However, investors took profits on most commercial banks. Bank of Tokyo fell Y30 to Y1,800 and Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y70 to Y3,400. Exporters were weak on the rise in the yen. Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y10 to Y1,350, Sony fell Y30 to Y4,420 and Toyota Motor fell Y10 to Y1,660. An overnight fall in gold prices on overseas markets prompted a fall in mining stocks. Sumitomo Metal Mining fell Y40 to Y1,010 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting lost Y20 to Y532. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 74.85 to 22,295.10 in volume of 25.8m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets went their own ways yesterday. HONG KONG continued to derive benefit from the better-than-expected results from HSBC's Midland Bank with domestic and foreign demand driving the market higher. The Hang Seng index ended 89.23 or 1.2 per cent higher at 7,396.77, for a 5.8 per cent rise on the week. Cheung Kong climbed HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 27.80 and its afilliate Hutchison Whampoa was up 40 cents to HKDollars 22.00. Jardine Matheson was up HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 59.50. But most active HSBC Holdings came under pressure from profit-taking after its 5 per cent surge on Thursday. It ended 50 cents down at HKDollars 79.50, but its Hang Seng Bank unit climbed HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 61.50. NEW ZEALAND saw a rise in Telecom mask an otherwise corrective day and the NZSE-40 capital index reversed an early 13.4 point fall to end 2.13 higher at 1,895.99, up 4.4 per cent on the week and another three year high. Telecom, 8 cents ahead at NZDollars 4.00, is seen as a major beneficiary from a tax reduction to foreign portfolio investors, announced earlier this week. BANGKOK was broadly higher in an extended bull run that surprised many analysts. The SET index advanced 10.58 to a five-month high of 958.84 in heavy turnover of Bt8.93bn. Property, media and electrical issues led the rally which has lifted the index by 7.7 percent over the past eight sessions. SINGAPORE was lifted by some late buying ahead of the long holiday weekend, and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 9.62 to 1,871.25, for a 3.5 per cent rise on the week. SYDNEY was hard hit early in the session by the gold price slump which left the All Ordinaries index 36 points lower initially. However, shares subsequently clawed back some of the losses and the index ended down 23.1 at 1,842.2, little changed on the week. Selling was on low volumes and mainly by smaller investors. Gold stocks recovered slightly from early selling, but still finished down 188.1 or 8.11 per cent at 2,131.4. Poseidon Gold shed 35 cents to ADollars 4.45, Placer Pacific 28 cents at ADollars 3.00, Homestake 26 cents to ADollars 2.02 and Newcrest 42 cents to ADollars 4.18. TAIWAN finished lower, as late profit-taking erased early gains. The weighted index, which gained more than 20 points in early trade, ended down 29.59 at 4,025.93, 0.8 per cent up on the week. Cement stocks, which had recently lagged the market, were the only gainers. Taiwan Cement rose 50 cents to TDollars 51.5. MANILA gave up some of its recent gains in response to the lower bullion price and the composite index dropped 16.95 at 1,743.97, a 0.4 per cent fall on the week. Benguet, the country's biggest gold producer, eased 1.25 pesos to 17 pesos. SEOUL was sharply lower as large-capitalisation shares shed early gains and individual investors remained in the sidelines. The composite index dipped 10.57 to 721.48, a 1.2 per cent fall on the week.

0,FT923-8052 ,"FT923-8052 _AN-CHQBDAESFT 920813   FT  13 AUG 92 / Absenteeism due to illness passes 500m days a year, report says      By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor   ABSENCE from work through illness in Britain passed half a billion days for the first time last year - nearly double the annual figure of a decade ago - a report published yesterday claims. The report, by Mr Rowland Goodwin, a stress expert, is based on an annual sample of doctors' certificates conducted by the Department of Social Security. Female absenteeism has risen especially fast, by 111 per cent, since 1982 when self-certification was introduced, compared with a rise of 55 per cent for men. Self-certification allows employees to stay off work for slightly longer without a doctor's certificate. A sick note signed by a doctor is needed only if the illness lasts over a week. Under the old system a doctor had to be consulted after three days. However, Mr Goodwin, of the Greater Manchester Industrial Mission, a church-based organisation, said self-certification was not necessarily to blame for the increase in absenteeism, and that the rate fell slightly after self-certification was introduced. There is no single explanation for the increase, according to Mr Goodwin, but he points to the ageing workforce and increasing pressure at work. He also claims that 35 per cent of the overall total of days lost is stress-related. His report concludes: 'At half a billion days per year, the cost to the health service and the loss in terms of efficiency and productivity at the workplace must now be taken seriously.' The report's findings provoked some scepticism, with Ms Lucy Mason of the Robens Institute for occupational health at Surrey University questioning Mr Goodwin's categorisation of stress-related diseases. The Confederation of British Industry said it worked out absenteeism only in money terms. Its latest figure, calculated in 1987, puts the annual cost to the economy at Pounds 5bn.

EPA intends to integrate these enhancements into one model for actual use.       A. Area Source Algorithm       Today's action proposes to replace the area source algorithm in the Industrial Source Complex model (ISC2) with a new one based on a double integration of the Gaussian plume kernel for area sources.   (1)     Short-term algorithm: ISCST2.     A previous EPA study 5  indicated that the currently implemented ISCST2 area source algorithm, based on a finite line segment approximation, estimates concentration distributions with limited accuracy, especially for receptors located close to the area source. An independent but later evaluation confirmed these findings.    6,7     These studies suggested that the integrated line source algorithm for modeling impacts from area sources provides a better treatment of near-source geometry than that currently recommended in ISCST2, and a reasonable far-field behavior. Based on these performance evaluations and limited field data, the integrated line source algorithm is a candidate to substitute for the current ISCST2 area source algorithm. Responding to public comments received at the time supplement B was proposed, steps were taken to develop and test this algorithm. In the new algorithm, 8  the ground-level concentration at a receptor downwind of all or a portion of the area source is given by a double integral in the upwind and crosswind directions. The integral in the lateral direction is solved analytically. The integral in the longitudinal direction (i.e., the summation of the contributions from the line sources in the upwind direction) is approximated with a Romberg integration technique. 9  The new algorithm, essentially equivalent to PAL 10  and the convergent mode of the FDM 11  integrated line source algorithm, has been shown to perform very well in terms of efficiency and of the reasonableness of the results. 12         5     Environmental Protection Agency, 1989.

(1)     Short-term algorithm: ISCST2.     A previous EPA study 5  indicated that the currently implemented ISCST2 area source algorithm, based on a finite line segment approximation, estimates concentration distributions with limited accuracy, especially for receptors located close to the area source. An independent but later evaluation confirmed these findings.    6,7     These studies suggested that the integrated line source algorithm for modeling impacts from area sources provides a better treatment of near-source geometry than that currently recommended in ISCST2, and a reasonable far-field behavior. Based on these performance evaluations and limited field data, the integrated line source algorithm is a candidate to substitute for the current ISCST2 area source algorithm. Responding to public comments received at the time supplement B was proposed, steps were taken to develop and test this algorithm. In the new algorithm, 8  the ground-level concentration at a receptor downwind of all or a portion of the area source is given by a double integral in the upwind and crosswind directions. The integral in the lateral direction is solved analytically. The integral in the longitudinal direction (i.e., the summation of the contributions from the line sources in the upwind direction) is approximated with a Romberg integration technique. 9  The new algorithm, essentially equivalent to PAL 10  and the convergent mode of the FDM 11  integrated line source algorithm, has been shown to perform very well in terms of efficiency and of the reasonableness of the results. 12         5     Environmental Protection Agency, 1989.

For receptors near ground level and within or near the area     #     source, the normalized modeled concentrations generally matched the wind tunnel measured concentrations to within     #     20%.

I thank my counterparts in the British parliament for answering my and my colleagues' open letter to them by submitting a motion in the House of Commons stating that it is a matter of urgency that our two governments 'negotiate an acceptable outcome to prevent the production of surplus plutonium' at Thorp. I would like to clarify that our open letter (the number of Diet members signing has now increased to 18) does not dispute the Japanese and British governments' policies. Rather, we ask them to explain logically why there are so many contradictions on this issue if their figures and assessments are indeed reliable. Japanese plutonium is already in surplus even without Thorp. The Science and Technology Agency, responding to my request, released on October 1 the most comprehensive information to date on current stocks, showing it at 4,530 kgs. Nearly three tonnes of this belongs to the electric utilities with no concrete plans to implement its use. Japan's policy of having fuel reprocessed abroad is very much a waste disposal policy. Because of Japan's experience with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, people rightly fear the effects of radiation. Siting of new nuclear power plants takes an average of 24 years. Nuclear waste disposal sites are wanted even less. To have been able to ship in excess of 5,000 tonnes of nuclear spent fuel to the UK and France for reprocessing has been a blessing to the Japanese nuclear industry. Japanese utilities remain silent about the fact that all waste produced after reprocessing at Thorp is due to return to Japan. Ethical Japanese will be obliged to inform you that there are no plans whatsoever for re-accommodating the low and intermediate level waste generated by reprocessing at Thorp. BNFL argues that this waste will be 'substituted' for high level waste, but this scheme is not in place. Also, our government has never admitted such proposals are being discussed. Both the Japanese and British governments are ignoring important realities. Good politics as well as good science must start from looking at realities as they are. Members of the Japanese Diet as well as the British parliament, therefore, have a duty to awaken our two governments to objective facts so that they would negotiate on Thorp.

0,FT932-12610 ,"FT932-12610 _AN-DD1B4AAMFT 930428   FT  28 APR 93 / Andreotti loses immunity, attacks Mafia probe      By ROBERT GRAHAM and HAIG SIMONIAN      ROME, MILAN   AN Italian Senate commission yesterday agreed to waive the parliamentary immunity of Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times Christian Democrat prime minister, bringing him one step closer to being investigated by Palermo magistrates for alleged collusion with the Sicilian mafia. It is the first time the commission has agreed to waive the immunity of such a prominent politician in a case of alleged links between the world of politics and organised crime. Mr Andreotti, aged 74, has been in public office since the founding of the republic and is seen in Italy as the symbol of the political establishment long controlled by the Christian Democrats. Yesterday he issued an angry statement repeating his view that the investigation by Palermo magistrates was a conspiracy to denigrate him. He added: 'I have absolutely no fear of the truth and will vigorously use every means to unmask these incredible machinations.' The 215 strong Senate, of which Mr Andreotti is a life member, must conduct a secret ballot to validate the decision. Yesterday,the voting of the 23 person commission was split according to political loyalty. The eight Christian Democrat members abstained, backed by two Socialists and the president of the commission, while one Liberal voted against him losing his immunity. Mr Andreotti revealed on March 27 that he had been notified by Palermo magistrates they wished to investigate him for alleged links with the mafia. The Senate commission has been hearing the case since April 14, and has four times been sent extra documentation from Palermo. The thrust of the Palermo magistrates' case is that Mr Andreotti has acted as the point of reference for the Sicilian mafia, Cosa Nostra, in Rome especially to influence the course of court cases against senior mafia members. The evidence is based extensively on testimony of former mafia members co-operating with the authorities. Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of Italy's publicly-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, yesterday admitted to having paid L26bn (Pounds 11.05m) in illegal contributions to the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties, Haig Simonian writes from Milan. Mr Cagliari said the system of illegal funding preceded his tenure as chairman, which began in 1989, but admitted he had not sought to stop the payments. Earlier this month, Mr Franco Reviglio, his predecessor as chairman between 1983-89, was notified by magistrates that he was under investigation for allegedly receiving illicit funds. The news triggered Mr Reviglio's resignation as finance minister in the former Amato government. Mr Cagliari has been detained in Milan's San Vittore prison since March 9 on allegations of corruption and illegally funding political parties. At the weekend, magistrates investigating political corruption added new charges of falsifying company accounts.   Companies:-  Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.

The surge in output suggests China faces serious difficulties bringing growth down to a target of 9 per cent this year compared with 12.8 per cent in 1993.

First of all, domestic investment, particularly in the  manufacturing sector, remains sluggish.    Vice Economic Affairs Minister Li Shu-jeou said the number  of  newly established factories declined in the first quarter of  this year and their aggregate paid-in capital also dropped as  compared with the year-earlier. Machinery imports, an effective  measure of investment activities, registered a 6 percent  decrease during the January-March period.    Li said difficulties in land acquisition remain the greatest  obstacle to private investment here. According to a recent  survey by the US-based McKinsey consulting firm, Taiwan's  industrial land prices are the second highest in Asia, behind  only Hong Kong.    Li added labor shortages, inadequate government incentives  and a growing ""anti-commerce complex"" have also discouraged  manufacturers from making new investments at home. He cited a  recent proposal by a township chief to levy ""community  development taxes"" on the construction sector and the forced  closure of the Makro Shopping Center in the Kaohsiung Industrial  Zone as examples of the so-called ""anti-commerce complex.""    Wang Chao-ming, a minister without portfolio, said he is  worried about possible power shortages because of the long delay  in construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant and  growing labor-management conflicts over work hours and insurance  issues.    ""If these problems cannot be resolved properly, our  industrial production and overall economic growth will be  adversely affected,"" Wang noted.    Kuo Wan-jung, also a minister without portfolio, said  Taiwan's foreign trade has become even more unbalanced, with its  reliance on the Mainland Chinese market increasing.    Taiwan's foreign trade surplus declined by nearly 70 percent  in the first four months of this year compared to 1993. Worse  yet, its trade deficit with Japan reached US$4.56 billion  between January and April. Taiwan also incurred a US$760  million trade deficit with Europe, while its trade surplus with  the United States shrank to US$893.9 million. Taiwan managed to  register a US$5.62 billion surplus in its trade with Hong Kong,  a major conduit for indirect Taiwan-Mainland China trade, during  the four-month period.    ""All these figures point to changes in Taiwan's trade  picture, with its exports to advanced countries, such as the US,  Japan and European nations, declining while its reliance on the  mainland market is rising,"" noted Kuo.    She also called attention to potential inflationary  pressure,  saying the nearly 2 percent depreciation of the new Taiwan  dollar in recent months and rising oil and raw material prices  in the international market may destabilize local commodity  prices which would hinder economic growth.    However, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for  Economic  Planning and Development said he remains optimistic about  Taiwan's economic prospects. ""Our economy is undergoing a  structural change, with technology-intensive industry playing an  increasingly important role,"" Hsiao noted.    Industrial production rose 6.2 percent in the January-April  period and heavy industry output grew an even more impressive 8  percent from the year-earlier level, he added.     "

Matsushita is introducing their forte of AV  technology into personal computers, and further strengthening  their information home electronics field. The shipment of  personal computers for multimedia which can process graphics and  audio in addition to character data is expanding year by year,  and IBM Japan, NEC, and others are also planning to introduce  products which have a television function. If a communications  service for both is begun in the future, there also are  expectations that the ""television personal computer"" will become  the favorite multimedia terminal within the home, and  competition has begun between home electronics and personal  computer manufacturers concerning the new market.    The DOS/V specification personal computer ""Woody"" which  Matsushita Electric Industrial is putting on sale is standard  equipped with audio multiplex television tuner, stereo speakers,  and a CD-ROM device (read only memory using compact disk).  Besides being able to see television on a 14-inch personal  computer screen, CD-ROM, music CD's, and ""photo CD's"" that store  photos on CD's also can be enjoyed.    Television programs can be received even while operating the  personal computer. For example, a news program is shown in a  corner of the screen while preparing a document with word  processing software. In order to digitize the analog television  video, the necessary scene is made into a static graphic and  introduced as data video in the document, and can be stored on a  hard disk. Use by beginners is assumed and recording of graphics  is performed by a simple button operation.    The price is 358,000 yen for the model which carries a  170-megabyte hard disk, and 398,000 yen for the 340-megabyte  model. They are set at a rather high price compared to  multimedia personal computers equipped with a CD-ROM device.  ""The target is the young age group of students up to 31 years  old. Rather than enjoyment by the whole family, demand for one  machine per person is expected."" (Mutsuo Miyake, manager,  Computer Division, Matsushita Electric Industrial) They are  scheduling yearly production of 50,000 machines.    IBM Japan soon will put on sale a television personal  computer carrying a television tuner with ""PS/V vision"" as the  basis. With price on the mid-300,000 yen level, it will directly  run up against the new products of Matsushita Electric  Industrial. NEC also believes that ""The color screen of a  personal computer can be applied to television, telephones, and  facsimile. We will be steadily introducing information equipment  in the home"" (Director Yuki Takayama). The time has not yet been  decided, but it appear that they will introduce a television  personal computer within the year.    It seems that they will proceed quickly in the future with  ""making a personal computer home appliance"" that incorporates  various functions such as a telephone and facsimile.     "

[Gerster] Good morning.    [Announcer] Mr. Gerster, the above-mentioned exposure [of  the  two U.S. KGB spies] caused surprise throughout the world. Do  you share that surprise?    [Gerster] Not at all. We knew, and of course know, that the  KGB is still spying to the same extent, especially in Germany.  The strange thing is that it has been split up; three  different, and I say this in quote marks, [word indistinct]  departments have been formed out of an originally single KGB,  which conduct espionage both abroad and at home.    Efforts are being made for official contacts; there have,  for  example, been contacts with the Bundestag Parliamentary Control  Commission in order to organize the secret service, shall I say,  according to a Western model, that is, democratically and on the  basis of a state based on the rule of law. But we know,  incidentally, that not only Russia, but other states in East  Europe are conducting espionage to the same extent and that, if  you like, while the policy of detente has certainly had  consequences for the military sphere, it has not for the  intelligence services.    [Announcer] Would you like to hazard a guess as to the  extent  of KGB espionage here?    [Gerster] That is always a matter for speculation, as you  know. If we knew everything we could put an end to this dreadful  game. But I can say that as far as we know, there has been  absolutely no change in the level [of espionage]. What is  surprising is that it is not only old comrades who are, for  example, placed in Germany as spies, but we know, for example  from the MfS [Ministry for State Security] sphere, that is, the  GDR State Security Ministry, that individual employees -- not  just three out of five, but a somewhat larger number -- have for  example gone over to the Soviet Union and have offered their  services to the intelligence services there. That means that  the repertoire of people prepared to spy in Russia has become  bigger rather than smaller.    [Announcer] If the scope of espionage activity has therefore  increased, can one then say that the focus of the espionage has  switched to other spheres?    [Gerster] I know that another East European state, which  really is making efforts toward democracy, directs over 50  percent of its efforts specifically at Germany.    [Announcer] Which state do you mean?    [Gerster] I do not want to name it. The only positive thing  from our point of view in this case is that although these  efforts are continuing, financial resources are limited. (?As  you know) we are making efforts for a type of security  partnership with the East European states -- this (?concerns)  NATO -- which naturally also has an effect on the EC. I think  one should try -- the Germans cannot do this on their own -- to  convene a type of conference with the East European states in  order to hold talks and make it clear to them that there cannot,  on the one hand, be efforts for cooperation with the EC and a  security partnership with NATO, while simultaneously virtually  continuing subversive actions. I think this really must be made  an international issue and that we have every reason, especially  as a target of these espionage efforts, [words indistinct].    [Announcer] Can one assume that the targets of espionage  have  moved more from the military to the economic sphere?    [Gerster] One cannot say that. Both spheres are affected,  whereby there were always two main pillars in East European  espionage, economic espionage on the one hand, and on the other  espionage in the political sphere, thus not only in the  military, but in the overall political sphere.    [Announcer] Let us stay with economic espionage. Is it in  fact still worth finding out things through espionage in the  West, given that there are now numerous cooperation, training,  and further qualification agreements between the East and West?    [Gerster] Let me put it this way. Democracy is still very  fragile in Russia as well. What the official policies pursued  by President Yeltsin and others are really aimed at, namely an  opening up and real friendship with the democratic states of the  West, has obviously not yet sunk into those who over decades saw  us purely and simply as the enemy and are simply (?carrying on).  It is probable that with the efforts for a market economy and  democracy and survival in increasingly democratic conditions,  conditions are so tense there that the spheres of classic old  defense mechanisms, the old mistrust of all these have not yet  been dismantled.    Therefore, I repeat that we have deliberately, as the  Parliamentary Control Commission, offered our services. The  former KGB held a conference over a year ago, when experts from  the democratic parliaments of Germany, England, France, the  United States, and other states were (asked?) to Moscow to  advise them. What astonishes me is that all these good talks had  no results at all.    [Announcer] Perhaps they did have the result that the  Western states will help modernize the KGB?    [Gerster] Definitely not. We are not development aid workers  in matters concerning the revamping of the Russian secret  service. Rather we are helping --and this is a task for  parliamentarians -- to make it clear to people that  parliamentary control, that is transparency, is for example, the  duty of a secret service, or at least that it is conducted at  the very core of parliament in our country. It is necessary,  and efforts are made to avoid arbitrary acts and mistakes in the  secret services. Thus, it is if anything a lesson in democracy  and not a lesson in the technicalities of intelligence activity.    [Announcer] You have clearly shown, Mr. Gerster, that the  secret services of the Eastern states are still active here in  the West. Is it not the other way round too?    [Gerster] First, I think the fact that states should  (?conduct) information work on world developments is obvious.  Second, worldwide, I should say -- the Federal Intelligence  Service still exists after all -- but an intelligence service on  the basis of a democratic state is not an aggressive institution  but an information organization and continues (?to be so).    [Announcer] But the KGB spy in the CIA also only wanted  information?    [Gerster] Well yes, your question is justified. There is a  difference. What for example the KGB was well-known for in past  years, that it used illegal methods -- you can be sure that that  is not possible in a democracy that gathered information  legally, made it available it to the government, but [word  indistinct]....    [Announcer, interrupting] ...but not according to the laws  in  which the espionage is carried out?    [Gerster] Well, all right, but the democratic laws are much  more narrow, much more strict, and much more restrictive.  Therefore, I would prefer the Federal Intelligence Service to  work under the laws of the Federal Republic than under Russian  laws, with all due respect.    [Announcer] In view of the indignation about the exposure of  a KGB spy in the United States, don't you think that this  indignation is at least in part hypocritical?    [Gerster] I would not say that, because you can be equally  certain that we have not placed any agents in presidential  offices, in the office of Russian president, nor in the  political leadership. Our acquisition of information is partly  based on publicly available sources. The Western intelligence  agencies have always worked differently to intelligence services  in communist states. They should (?do) it on a different basis  in the future. To put it in a somewhat slangy way -- the  Federal Intelligence Service is as a rule significantly more  harmless than the public assumes, and I say that not to absolve  myself, but in complete awareness of what I am saying.

The debate  was enhanced by topics as important as Latin American  integration in industrial property [propiedad industrial] and  what the subcontinent could do in light of the new challenges  posed by the revamping of the international legal order, which  is gaining strength.    Regarding the use of the patents cooperation agreement,  which  began (?in May) 1978 under the auspices of the Intellectual  Property World Organization [Organizacion Mundial de Propiedad  Intellectual], the participants discussed some of the advantages  to the countries that adhere to it, including the right to  defend claims on inventions in more than 60 countries and the  extension of the time granted to applicants before entering the  national phase; these advantages allow for further development  of the invention, marketing, and facilitate a better financial  condition in order to meet other expenditures. Here, one needs  access to an extensive technological bibliography. Jesus  Sanchez Lima, from the United States, has commented on the  treaty and the North to South transfer of technology.    [Begin Sanchez recording] I look at it from a perspective  different from other participants in this field, many who  primarily.... [pauses] regarding the lobbying by the (?First  World) against the Third World. Though I believe in the patents  system and think these limited monopolies granted to the  inventors are the most effective way to stimulate inventions, I  believe, nonetheless, there must be a limit to those monopolies.  Those limits in many countries that are forced by economic  reasons to join treaties like GATT and NAFTA may not yield the  expected results. [end recording]    During the international seminar emphasis was also placed on  the overlap between copyright or industrial property, which  provide protection to artistic and literary works, and  inventions and patent rights. There was a consensus to consider  a possible legal system, at both the national and international  levels and to establish the principle of a single right over  goods and materials. In conclusion, here is the opinion of one  of the Cuban experts who attended the meeting.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] It has challenged us  to exercise our intelligence, and by that word I mean the  intelligence of those who live in Cuba. It has made us think  beyond what we are used to thinking and even open ourselves to  the challenges our domestic policy of promoting foreign  investments in certain sectors are posing. Matters we had not  considered, including in our legislation, are discussed here as  the problems other legislations have. They will not be problems  for our laws, because we have been forewarned. In a general  sense, the [word indistinct] is highly positive. [end recording]    This seminar also served to explore the future report that  will contain the steps Cuba has been taking against legal  regulations on industrial property and the expectations it  offers Latin America by adjusting its laws.

Hazard Statement       Fish and molluscan shellfish may be harvested from waters   that are exposed to varying amounts of environmental   contaminants. Industrial chemicals, pesticides, and many toxic   elements may accumulate in fish at levels that can cause public   health problems. Concern for these contaminants primarily   focuses on fish and shellfish harvested from fresh water,   estuaries, and near-coastal waters rather than from the open   ocean. Pesticides and herbicides used near aquaculture   operations or for other purposes may contaminate fish and fishery   products.   Federal tolerances or action levels are established for some   of the most toxic and persistent contaminants that are found in   fish and fishery products shipped in interstate commerce. (These   contaminants and their corresponding limits are listed below.)   When products exceed these limits, FDA can seize the contaminated   fish and fishery products.   States often use the limits for deciding whether to issue   consumption advisories or to close or classify waters for   harvesting. Molluscan shellfish waters are controlled by the   State Shellfish Control Agency (SSCA) or the equivalent in   foreign countries that have Memoranda of Understanding with the   United States that permit them to export molluscan shellfish to   this country. If local or regional contaminants are not covered   by federal limits, contact local health departments to decide if   contaminant levels in fish and fishery products are of public   health concern.   The control measures provided in this section are   appropriate for the control of methyl mercury contamination in   fish, where such contamination is the result of industrial   contamination in a harvest area. Recommended controls for the   problem of open ocean species, such as swordfish and shark,   concentrating methyl mercury from their diet and its diffuse   presence in the environment are provided in the ``Mercury'' hazard   section.       Critical Control Point: Receiving       There are five options for control at this critical control   point.       Option 1       Where the firm receives wild caught fish, other than   molluscan shellfish, directly from the fisher or from a supplier   that has credible knowledge of the harvest area location (e.g., a   tender or related company that pools fish from various fishers),   the following applies:      Control Measures       1. Find out the harvest area location for each lot or batch   from the fisher upon receipt.   2. Find out whether the harvest area is closed to fishing   by foreign, Federal, State or local health authorities due to   known instances of chemical contamination.   3. Reject fish that have been caught in a closed area.       Example       ABC Fish Co. has contacted the State Department of   Health and learned that the Long River is closed to   commercial harvest above Lookout Point, including its   tributaries, due to the presence of chlordecone   (Kepone    TM    ). The species affected are croaker,   bluefish, and striped bass. ABC Fish Co., which   processes these species, will reject any of the listed   species originating from the area.          "

The amount of radioactivity released by the materials  already  imported has not actually been measured but both company and  state officials believe the concentrations of radioactive  elements are so low as to pose no danger to public health.    However, for safety's sake, the materials will reportedly be  transported to Bangkok today to be used by the Office of Atomic  Energy for Peace (OAEP).    Thai Tantalum Co Ltd imported the waste last year as raw  material for the extraction of tantalum pentoxide and columbium  pentoxide -- used to make electronic capacitors -- at its  factory in the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate.    But company president Yut Eamsa-at said it was only a ""free  sample"" and had not been used because it was low-grade. He  agreed yesterday not to import any more of the substance.    Officials from the Department of Industrial Works' Office of  Hazardous Substances (OHS) were informed about the shipment and  issued Thai Tantalum an import licence. But they were not told  that it contained radioactive substances, or that it came from a  hazardous waste site.    ""We believe Thai Tantalum was just looking for cheap raw  materials and they are not interested in importing any more of  the waste,"" OHS Director Virah Mavichak said yesterday. ""The  amount of radioactivity is believed to be low, but we are  unhappy that it came from a waste site. So we will revoke the  import licence.""    According to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)  documents, the shipment originated from a hazardous waste site  in Muskogee, Oklahoma which contains roughly 21 tonnes of  thorium and nine tonnes of uranium, both highly radioactive  substances. The waste site belongs to Fansteel Inc, a former  producer of tantalum and columbium products which now supplies  Thai Tantalum with technical expertise.    Thai Tantalum officials yesterday could not say for sure how  much radioactive matenal was in the waste brought into Thailand.  According to Jim Hill, a former employee of Fansteel now working  as Thai Tantalum's lab manager, the thorium and uranium were  unevenly distributed through Fansteel's sludge ponds, which were  ""the size of a football field"" and contained 13.4 million kg of  mostly solid waste.    An X-ray analysis of the imported materials carried out by  Hill revealed with ""90 percent certainty"" that uranium and  thorium made up less than 0.2 percent of the sludge, or 5.5 kg.  He said some of the standards needed to carry out the analysis  were lacking.    However, Thai Tantalum has never actually measured the  radioactivity of the imported materials, or of the estimated 60  kg of radioactive materials it puts in its state-of-the-art  landfill every day, because it does not have a geiger counter.    But Yut sought to assure the public that the low  concentrations of radioactive material, combined with the  factory's hi-tech waste treatment system, meant that the area  was safe. The company's former plant in Phuket was burned to  the ground in 1986 by protestors afraid of being exposed to  radioactivity.     "

0,FT932-16906 ,"FT932-16906 _AN-DDDAIAAHFT 930403   FT  03 APR 93 / Marlboro price cut knocks shares on Wall Street      By MARTIN DICKSON      NEW YORK   PHILIP MORRIS declared an all-out price war in the US tobacco industry yesterday by slashing the price of its Marlboro brand to protect its market share from the rise of discount brands. The decision sent the company's share price sharply lower on Wall Street and contributed to a 2 per cent fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock market was also upset by an unexpected fall in US employment and a drop in bond prices. The cut - possibly by as much as 20 per cent - in the price of America's most popular cigarette and one of the world's most valuable trademarks is restricted to the US. It is expected to have little immediate effect on Philip Morris's international operations, which include an estimated quarter-share of the European Community market. A packet of Marlboro costs on average Dollars 2.15, nearly twice that of discount cigarettes at around Dollars 1.20 a pack, according to Philip Morris. Analysts think Marlboro will be cut by about 40 cents, narrowing the gap between the brand and the cheapest pack of discount cigarettes from around Dollars 1.06 to 66 cents. On the New York Stock Exchange, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 68.63 lower at 3,370.81, Philip Morris stock fell more than 20 per cent, or Dollars 15 1/4 , to Dollars 49 3/8 . This erased about Dollars 13.5bn from the group's stock market valuation. RJR Nabisco dropped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 6 3/4 and American Brands fell Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 30. In London, BAT's price tumbled 71p to 928p on exceptionally heavy turnover as traders feared the move could dent the UK group's profits. Philip Morris, which is the American cigarette market leader with an estimated 43 per cent share, said it expected operating earnings from its US tobacco business to be down as much as 40 per cent in 1993 because of its new strategy. Some analysts cut their 1993 earnings forecasts for the group from around Dollars 6.45 a share to around Dollars 5 a share. Mr James Johnston, chairman of RJR Reynolds Tobacco, the second largest US tobacco company, with a 28 per cent market share, said it intended to remain fully competitive and would take 'appropriate action' to protect its market share. The move follows a gradual erosion of Marlboro's brand share, which dipped to around 24.5 per cent of the US market in 1992 from 25.8 per cent in 1991 as smokers switched to cheaper branded cigarettes and generic varieties with no brand image. These discount cigarettes, substantially less profitable for the manufacturers, have seen their share of the US market grow from about 19 per cent in 1990, to about 36 per cent last year.

The Electronics  Research and Service Organization (ERSO), one of ITRI's  departments, will be the parent body of the new manufacturer. It  has completed the development of a new 16-MB DRAM chip using  0.5-micron technology. The process will use 200-mm wafers. The  production line created by ERSO for trial production of the chip  will be expanded for full-scale production purposes. The  manufacturing facility is located in the Hsinchu High-Technology  Park. The name of the company, the size of its investment, and  the annual output, are still undecided. The possibility of a  funding consortium consisting of several manufacturers is now  being explored.    ERSO is one of 11 subdivisions of ITRI. Its Submicron  Project  includes 0.5-micron CMOS (16 MB DRAM) development and also  0.35-micron and smaller CMOS development by National Nanodevice  Laboratories, established in 1992.    The 0.5-micron 16-MB DRAM chip was designed by Etron  Technology of Taiwan. Etron's founder, Nicky C. C. Lu, is a  former IBM DRAM designer. According to Mr. Lu, the 16-MB DRAM  chip is a first-generation chip, with an area of 100  mm[.sup]2[/], in a 400-mil package. A stacked memory cell  design will be used. The technology for the more recent trench  process is not yet available in Taiwan. The second-generation  chip will be a synchronous DRAM for high-speed data  transmission. An attempt will be made to use the  ``lead-on-chip'' (LOC) technology. The search for an existing  manufacturer who can implement this technology is now under way.    The TI-Acer company of Taiwan is now producing 4-MB DRAM. In  Phase 1 of the Fab 1 stage, 1500 units a month of 0.8-micron  technology 150-mm equivalent chips will be produced. Phase 2 is  scheduled to get under way in 1995. The total output will be  24,000 units per month. Mosel Vitelic, a DRAM-oriented company  that produces for the Taiwan electrical engineering industry, is  setting up a clean room to meet 0.5-micron standards. Operation  is expected to begin this year. Taiwan's largest LSI producer,  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC), plans  to produce DRAM under the Fab 3 stage, which began in December  1993.    Taiwan's Department of Economics is backing this effort to  create a DRAM project from existing enterprises and government  research organizations. In December 1992, the ministry  designated 66 systems and components as key projects for  stepped-up effort in order to replace imported products. The 66  designated products are grouped into three ranks. Rank A  consists of products for which the Department of Economics has  created a technology development project team and is carrying on  the RD. Rank B consists of technologies for which a  subdivision  of the Industrial Office has created a development plan for  joint implementation by two or more enterprises. Rank C consists  of projects in which enterprises are investing, with government  support in order to facilitate production.     "

0,FT942-6385 ,"FT942-6385 _AN-EE4DFABRFT 940531   FT  31 MAY 94 / The Hualon Project: Big assumptions made on costs and demand      By JENNY LUESBY and GUY DE JONQUIERES   Hualon says its proposed plant near Belfast aims to compete with Asian producers' exports of polyester, polyamide and polycotton fabrics to Europe. The plant is to be built in four phases. It will initially dye and finish imported fabric, then weave and finally spin the yarn for fabrics to make low-cost clothes. However, the plant's viability and claimed benefits for the Ulster economy depend on questionable assumptions: That Hualon can compete with Asian producers on price. That there will be a sufficient market for its products. If the plant is to undercut Asian producers, its costs will need to be lower than theirs. But although its start-up costs are being subsidised, it is hard to see how this will be achieved. Savings on transport costs will be negligible because Hualon plans to import its raw materials from its own plants in Asia. And while Ulster's Industrial Development Board says the plant's technology will make it one of the most efficient producers in Europe, the same technology is already used by Hualon and many other producers in Asia. Meanwhile, the plant's labour costs will be considerably higher than its Asian equivalents. The British Textile and Apparel Confederation, which opposes the Belfast plant, estimates that with the proposed technology and output levels it would require only 950 jobs, rather than the 1,800 promised in the case that was put to Brussels. A 1993 index of labour costs in the spinning and weaving industry showed the Irish wage cost per operator hour to be 80 per cent of that in the UK. But in Taiwan, Malaysia and Vietnam the labour costs were only 57 per cent, 12 per cent and 4 per cent of those in the UK. Other producers have relocated output to other sites such as Turkey, Hungary and Egypt, where labour costs are 26 per cent, 16 per cent and 4 per cent respectively of the UK's. On the demand side, the odds also seem stacked against Hualon. European consumption of woven fabrics is contracting rapidly as clothing manufacturers, which buy most of the industry's output, move production to lower-cost countries. In the six years to 1993, total consumption fell 14 per cent. The decline is likely to gather pace after the recent deal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to end the Multi-Fibre Arrangements, which have long restricted cotton textiles and clothing imports from low-cost countries. Furthermore, the market appears to be contracting fastest at the low-cost end of the clothing industry, where Hualon has chosen to compete. European producers have tried to fight competition by offering greater flexibility and speed of delivery. Hualon will find this difficult because of its bulk-run production methods, which cannot be tailored to particular orders without raising costs considerably.   Companies:-  Hualon Corp.

Speaking at the meeting, Vice President of the People's  Bank of China Dai Xianglong urged that all banks and relevant  departments should prepare sufficient funds for the purchase of  summer grain and oil-bearing crops in a timely manner so that  farmers will not be given ""IOU's.""    Dai Xianglong called on all localities to seriously  implement  the responsibility system of supplying funds for the purchase of  summer grain and oil-bearing crops. Under the unified  leadership of governments at all levels, banks and relevant  departments should ensure funds for the purchase of summer grain  and oil-bearing crops. All branches of the People's Bank of  China should supervise the supply of money in addition to  coordinating the work of supplying purchasing funds. Before the  end of June the supply and management of funds for the purchase  of grain and oil-bearing crops will be the responsibility of the  Agricultural Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank. Beginning  1 July, the Agricultural Bank will undertake sole responsibility  for supply and management.    Dai Xianglong stressed: To ensure the needs for purchasing  funds, all banks should strengthen unified management and ensure  the orderly use of funds. The branches of specialized banks  should ensure payment, ensure funds for the purchase of grain  and oil-bearing crops in various localities, and grant other  loans in accordance with plans and policies and the amount of  available capital. Should there be a surplus of funds, it  should be used under the unified management of banks of a higher  level. He said: Serious efforts should be made to strengthen  management to ensure the prompt supply of funds for the purchase  of grain and oil-bearing crops and to prevent the diversion of  purchasing funds for other purposes. Specialized banks and  their branches, and the People's Bank should ensure their funds  and short-term loans are first used for payment and purchasing  of grain and oil-bearing crops. The People's Bank will allocate  an additional sum of 6 billion yuan to the Agricultural Bank to  be used for purchasing farm and sideline products.    Dai Xianglong pointed out: It is necessary to strengthen  control over the size of purchasing funds. When funds for the  purchase of state-controlled farm and sideline products such as  grain and oil-bearing crops are insufficient, purchasing  authorities may obtain loans first and report the borrowing to  the state later. He also stressed: It is necessary to  strengthen the management of markets for grain and oil-bearing  crops in coordination with relevant departments by applying the  means of credit and account settlement. Granting loans to  support rush purchasing in other localities and selling and  buying grain and oil-bearing crops outside the prescribed limits  must be strictly prohibited.    In conclusion, Dai Xianglong urged all banks to do a good  job  in supplying and managing funds for the purchase of summer grain  and oil-bearing crops, and to satisfy the farmers by avoiding  the practice of writing ""IOU'S"" due a shortage of purchasing  funds.

0,FT944-5244 ,"FT944-5244 _AN-ELECYABPFT 941205   FT  05 DEC 94 / After the peace, the fight for jobs: Northern Ireland has much riding on its investment conference      By STEWART DALBY   More than 40 per cent of Northern Ireland's workforce is employed by the British government. Many of the jobs in the security sector - up to 20,000 - will be lost if the IRA and loyalist paramilitary ceasefires prove durable. The province's unemployed total of 100,000 would jump 20 per cent unless jobs are replaced. That is why so much is riding on the success of the international investment conference which takes place in Belfast on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is hosting the event and will be backed by US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown. Invitations have gone out to leading international companies, organisations which have contributed funds in the past, local political leaders and leading EU trade officials. Northern Ireland has an urgent need to attract inward investment and it is prepared to pay generous incentives - as the controversial Pounds 61m grant to help the textiles group Hualon set up a plant has highlighted. The Industrial Development Board, which dispenses grants, has a powerful array of lures to attract foreign companies. A Northern Ireland incentives package can, in theory, amount to between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of total costs - though in practice it is usually far less. The IDB claims that in 1993-94 the government contribution to new investment was 21.5 per cent for both domestic and inward investment. The IDB says that since 1986 overseas investment has totalled Pounds 1.6bn, involving 265 projects and creating 22,702 jobs. The gross cost per job assisted in inward investment promotions in 1993-94 was Pounds 27,424 - meaning Northern Ireland has one of the most expensive job creation programmes in the UK. The IDB argues that it is necessary to spend money. The image of violence has been a powerful deterrent to new companies, but the province is also perceived by many outsiders as having a peripheral position in the UK. It has a population of 1.5m and therefore a small domestic market. Its economy is poorly integrated with that of the republic and the Irish Sea separates it from the mainland UK market. In trying to sell the province to investors, Northern Ireland officials argue that there are other factors apart from grants and incentives which make it attractive and offset its remoteness. Industrial land costs Pounds 40,000 an acre compared with Pounds 185,000 in the English Midlands and upwards of Pounds 400,000 in London. Construction costs are much lower. According to European Commission figures an index of office construction costs puts Northern Ireland at 65 compared with 100 for Britain and 113 for Belgium. Residential property is cheaper too. A detached house costs Pounds 57,202 in Northern Ireland compared with an average UK price of Pounds 94,315. The workforce is educated: Northern Ireland has excellent schools, with a higher rate of A-level passes than any other part of the UK. Wages are 16 per cent lower than in mainland Britain. The province can offer 50 per cent cash grants for buildings - more generous than either Wales or Scotland. It can also offer cash grants for machinery and equipment, training and job creation. If a company wants to rent rather than build a factory there are grants for up to 100 per cent of rental costs for up to five years. There are also product development grants, marketing grants, and grants for relief on loans. Although the province is handicapped in comparison with the Irish republic by having to levy corporation tax at the UK rate, companies making taxable profits of less than Pounds 250,000 pay a 25 per cent rate. There are allowances for depreciation on machinery and equipment and for the construction costs of industrial buildings. However, next week's investment conference is likely to be hampered by the haste with which it has been organised. An official at the British consul general's office in the US said: 'When we got the guest list our first reaction was 'Wow] - we haven't got time.' US companies are drawing up boardroom budgets and preparing for Christmas at this time of year. We think it is too short notice.' A guest list of US corporate 'possibles' was sent to the consul general only in early November by the Industrial Development Board and invitations began to be sent on November 18. When the speeches are over, those who have been able to accept the invitation will be invited to visit factory sites and companies which have already chosen to set up in Northern Ireland.

The failure  of the Credit and Industrial Bank of Prague and the subsequent  closing of the Bohemia Bank brought about defensive reflexes  within society; the confidence of the populace in the entire  system is melting away like ice in the summer sun.    The nervousness is currently concentrated upon the so-called  small banks, which are those that have recently come into being  and whose basic worth is about 1 billion korunas [Kc] or beneath  that level. On the other hand, large institutions are perceived  as being safe and secure.    Except that this is also a matter for discussion. Not even  the giant posthumous children of the monopolistic financial  system that existed under the socialist economy are in ""as cozy  a situation"" as it may seem. Recently, reports reached the  public regarding some of their heavy mistakes--for example, the  payment of a forged check for Kc60 million by the Bank of  Commerce and a mistake involving precious gemstones that,  provided it is confirmed, could cost the Investment and Postal  Bank Kc500 million. Experience indicates that only a fraction of  what goes on in the banks ever reaches the public eye.  Accordingly, one cannot only figure that even the large  institutions engage in failed ventures, but also that there will  very likely be more such ventures than have currently become  known.    The current lack of confidence in small banks is, moreover,  nurtured by uncertain reports regarding their uncertain  financial situation. And so a single exemplary case is  sufficient. And two failures within the short period of six  months--that is simply too much. And what today's published  report regarding the difficulties being experienced by the AB  Bank will be cannot even be estimated.    For purposes of confidence in the system, it is immaterial  that both cases--the Bohemia and the Credit and Industrial  Bank--are special cases and do not have a whole lot in common  with pure banking. In the case of the Credit and Industrial  Bank, this is obviously a matter of fraudulent activity to  benefit selected clients of the institution; in the case of the  Bohemia Bank, the culprit was illegal foreign operations by part  of the management of the firm.    The Czech National Bank has hardened conditions for doing  business in the industry in recent months. It increased its  oversight over individual institutions, imposed higher standards  that banking houses must meet. Thanks to this move, six  institutions are now under heightened control--the Czech  National Bank assigns them tasks and makes recommendations to  their management teams and compels them to strengthen the  financial position of their bank.    When the business boom began in 1990 and in the subsequent  years, it turned out that the large institutions were far too  cumbersome, do not know how to expand their services with  sufficient speed, and are proving ineffective in terms of  distributing their resources--in other words, lending money  where there is an interest in such loans. And small and medium  business entrepreneurs were interested. There was more demand  for loans, which exceeded the supply of available money. In  other words, the large corporations were not striving in any way  to attract this clientele. The market reacted in a natural  way--small and medium-size banks began to come into being.    However, since that time, the situation has changed. The  supply of money has increased and is probably even greater than  the demand for new credits today. The large banks were also  faced with tough competition--a number of enterprises that had a  reputation and good plans turned their backs on them and their  high interest rates. They either borrowed money abroad or issued  bonds. The large banks began to find that the world is not only  colored a rosy pink and had to begin paying attention even to  those clients whom the black-garbed sheriffs never even allowed  in the building before. Of course, this is contributing to the  worries of the small banks--in order to succeed, they must lower  their loan rates. And this is precisely a problem for them.    When the small banks needed money for credits, they were  compelled to acquire primary resources, the best of which were  time deposits from the populace and from enterprises. And  persuading a customer to deposit money precisely with their  institution meant paying higher interest rates than were being  paid by the large institutions.    In other words, the small banks were offering better  conditions for depositing money, and, consequently, on the other  hand, they also made more costly loans. As the interest of the  large institutions is expanding, so the operating room of the  smaller ones is shrinking--and the fact that they apparently  have more pleasant personnel, are more flexible, etc. does not  alter much in this situation. The fundamental economic rule of  price will have its way.    Thus, the small banks have no choice but to rapidly become  larger. Many are working arduously at this task--never before  have there been so many reports regarding increases in basic  worth that have followed each other so rapidly as has been the  case in recent months. But that will not be enough. The Czech  National Bank, which is guarding the health of the banking  sector, knows very well that the structure of the financial  institutions is unsuitable and is planning to bring about a  change in the structure through new regulations. And so there  will clearly soon be a wave of mergers and fusions involving the  smaller banking houses. Overall, perhaps the number of banks  will shrink, but this is not a pity. For this price, the  financial institutions will buy back the confidence of the  population, which they had lost in part.     "

0,FT932-3104 ,"FT932-3104 _AN-DFPCDABOFT 930616   FT  16 JUN 93 / Protest against ICI claim is backed      By GARY MEAD and PAUL ABRAHAMS   THE Advertising Standards Authority yesterday upheld four out of five complaints brought by Greenpeace, the environmental group, against Imperial Chemical Industries. The complaints related to ICI's claims about the environmental impact of Klea 134a, its substitute for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The rulings are a significant embarrassment for the British group. It has invested more than Pounds 250m developing the substitute for CFCs, which are believed to be a significant factor in the depletion of the ozone layer surrounding the earth and will be banned by the end of 1995. Greenpeace alleged that ICI had underplayed the extent to which Klea 134a would contribute to global warming. ICI's claims about Klea 134a were published last October in The House magazine, distributed to MPs and parliamentary staff. In spite of the ASA rulings, ICI yesterday rejected Greenpeace's demand for publication of an apology. It said that the advertisement had been factually correct, that any changes required were essentially semantic and that the ASA had agreed the company had not intended to mislead. The ASA had consulted the Meteorological Office for independent advice on the accuracy of ICI's claims. The ASA, an independent watchdog on printed advertising standards, supported ICI's claim that the direct impact of Klea 134a on global warning was 90 per cent less than that of the CFCs it replaces. But it upheld Greenpeace's challenge to the group's claim that Klea 134a would never contribute more than 1 per cent of the total man-made greenhouse effect. Greenpeace maintained that Klea 134a would contribute at least 6 per cent. ICI argued yesterday that its figures were accurate and supported by a German parliamentary commission. The ASA said it had discounted a report from one independent body which was found to have contained some errors. The same source said a general problem with the advertisement was that ICI had selected from several equally possible scenarios the one most favourable to its own case. The ASA described ICI as 'extremely co-operative' in the case. The ASA also ruled that ICI's claim that 'Klea 134a is at least as energy-efficient as any other alternative likely to be commercially available in the foreseeable future' was insufficiently supported by independent evidence. ICI said yesterday the ASA had acknowledged that the technical report it had used to make this particular adjudication was out of date. The company argued that a recent German consumer-testing agency had shown that Klea 134a consumed three times less energy than the most efficient propane or butane refrigerators. The ASA also upheld the complaint against ICI's claim that 98 per cent of global warming comes from electricity used by refrigeration equipment. This is true of domestic refrigerators, but not retail equipment which accounts for more than half of CFC use. The body also said ICI's claim that recycling programmes could prevent any emissions was unsubstantiated.   Companies:-  Imperial Chemical Industries.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The flotation began last Wednesday and by Monday a total of  20 billion yuan ($2.3 biilion) worth of three- and five-year  bonds will be issued to 10 financial institutions, said Yao  Zhenyan, president of the bank.    Instructed by the People's Bank of China, the central bank,  these institutions will also buy 8 billion yuan ($920 million)  in bonds next month.    The bank is planning to issue 65 billion yuan (S7.5 billion)  in bonds this year. The rest will be sold in three batches in  the second half of this year, Yao said.    The institutions buying the bonds are the Shanghai and  Shenzhen branches of the People's Bank of China, the Industrial  and Commercial Bank, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank,  the Construction Bank, the Communications Bank, the Everbright  Bank, the Industrial Bank of the China International Trust   Investment Corp and the Post Saving and Remitting Bureau.    The paperless bonds cannot be traded in the market or among  banks, but they can be used as collateral when borrowing money  from the central bank.    The issue of financial bonds is an important way to ensure  that the bank, which went into operation on July 13, has enough  capital to support the country's key construction projects.    More capital will come from the national treasury, which has  promised 50 billion yuan ($5.75 billion) of registered capital  over the next four years.    Relying on the financial bonds and State allocations, the  bank this year is planning to supply 80 billion yuan ($9.2  billion) in low-interest loans for infrastructural construction.    About 40 per cent of the loans is expected to be granted in  the first half of this year, Yao said, adding that the money  raised through the bonds will be channelled to projects within  several days.    The bank's loans will be used for developing the country's  key infrastructural projects and the basic but overburdened  industries that have been hindering economic growth.    This year's beneficiaries include 345 large and medium-sized  construction projects such as the giant Three Gorges Dam, the  Beijing-Kowloon railway and some big power stations.    To raise more capital, Yao said, his bank is quite willing  to  co-operate with international financial sources.    At first, the bank will be responsible for the relending of  some loans from foreign governments and international financial  organizations.    It is also likely to issue bonds overseas if it gets the  approval, of the State.    Yao said many overseas financial institutions have expressed  their wishes to help the bank issue overseas bonds.    Furthermore, Yao said, the bank will also seek commercial  loans from overseas banks.    He said the bank will set up some affiliates in foreign  countries in the future.    Establishing the State Development Bank is an important part  of the country's financial reform. It is aimed at ensuring the  smooth flow of capital to key State projects and providing the  central government with a powerful tool to rein in excessive  investment in fixed assets.     "

Taking this opportunity, I wish to say a few words.    The year 1993 saw the collapse of bubble economy, a huge  wave  of the rising yen which almost swept us away, a continuing  recession, and it ended without showing any sign of recovery  from the recession. What we are seeking in the year 1994 is what  will free us from this recessionary economy. The conditions in  the United States, on the other hand, are very different from  those of Japan and the European countries. It has come out of  the recession and is currently showing steady economic growth.  One of the factors which has contributed to the U.S.'s economic  recovery is that the country is attaching great importance to  the technology learned from Japan. This is especially evident in  recent improvement evident in the quality of the U.S.-made  automobiles, and it is the automobile industry which made it  possible for the U.S. economy to achieve growth. This tells us  that emphasis on technology will be essential especially during  recessionary times.    Needless to say, development of industrial technology  changes  not only industries and economic activities, but also our mode  of living. These changes, conversely, will become a motive power  necessary for the development of industrial technology. Demand  for industrial technology will grow not only as a part of the  means of dealing with the recession, but also as a means of  dealing with the problems of environment on a global scale, of  energy, and of resources.    After viewing the future prospects, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry has revealed its own visions in  various areas. In order to meet the challenge of the future, the  Agency of Industrial Science and Technology has also reorganized  its research institutes and put into effect its various plans,  such as starting the industrial science technology development  system and the New Sunshine Project. In order to give this idea  a form, our association is devoting its effort to fulfill our  role as ""a technological bridge linking government and industry""  since its establishment.    As the noteworthy topics of 1993, we would like to mention  that a party of the English House of Common (a Science  Technology Commission mission) and a survey committee from  Malaysia and Mexico came to us seeking the answer to the  question of ""How the technology owned by the country is  transferred to the private sector."" These people were  interested in the problems associated with state-owned  technology transfer, especially that of patents; technical  exchange among the industrial, academic, and governmental  sectors; and transfer of state-owned technology to small- and  medium-sized businesses. The visits of theses overseas parties  made us aware of the importance of the tasks assigned to the  association.    As expectations to industrial technologies grow bigger, we  feel that we must make every effort to achieve our mission as a  bridge linking government and industry while reviewing the  association's work and its systems.    I shall be grateful if all of you, members and associates,  will give us your guidance and support, and with this I wish to  conclude my speech and wish you all a very happy New Year.     "

(a)     Purpose    _(1)     General toxicity.     This subchronic inhalation study is   designed to determine a concentration-response relationship for   potential toxic effects in rats resulting from continuous or   repeated inhalation exposure to vehicle/engine emissions over a   period of 90 days. A subgroup of perfusion-fixed animals is   required, in addition to the main study population, for more   exacting organ and tissue histology. This test will provide   screening information on target organ toxicities and on   concentration levels useful for running chronic studies and   establishing exposure criteria. Initial information on effective   concentrations/exposures of the test atmosphere may be determined   from the literature of previous studies or through concentration   range-finding trials prior to starting this study. This health   effects screening test is not capable of directly determining   those effects which have a long latency period for development   (e.g., carcinogenicity and life-shortening), though it may permit   the detremination of a no-observed-adverse-effect level, or   NOAEL.      (2)     Specific health effects assessments (HEAs).     These   supplemental studies are designed to determine the potential for   reproductive/teratologic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and neurotoxic   health effect outcomes from vehicle/engine emission exposures.   They are done in combination with the subchronic toxicity study   and paragraph (c) of this section or may be done separately as   outlined by the appropriate test guideline.               "

At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.15 at 3,683.95, but the more broadly based Standard  Poor's 500 was 0.11 easier at 461.79. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite lost 0.66 at 460.03, but the Nasdaq composite gained 2.85 at 754.39 after reversing an earlier downward trend. NYSE volume was 286m shares. The uncertain mood which has dominated Wall Street recently was underscored by investors' jittery reaction to the first in a series of economic reports this week which are expected to indicate robust growth during the final three months of the year. Stock prices dipped immediately after the release of the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence, which surged to 71.2 this month, compared with a consensus forecast of about 60. Separately, the index of business activity by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago showed one of the biggest monthly gains in the survey's 25-year history. The fresh data served to exacerbate anxieties among bond traders, who fear the economy's gathering strength could be a signal of higher inflation. In late trading the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue had fallen nearly a point to 99 9/32 , yielding 6.298 per cent. But the mood on Wall Street was not as bleak as in the bond market, and equity prices began to inch higher as the morning progressed. By early afternoon the Dow Industrial index was up nearly 20 points, before slipping to leave a more modest gain at the close. With crude oil prices firming after hitting a three-year low on Monday, energy shares regained lost ground. Exxon was Dollars 1 better at Dollars 62 3/4 and Amoco gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 53 1/2 . Atlantic Richfield, up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 103 3/4 , and Mobil, Dollars 1 1/8 firmer at Dollars 76 1/8 , were given an extra lift when investment analysts raised ratings on the issues. By contrast, transport companies, which are the heaviest users of petroleum products, gave back some of their recent gains. AMR, parent of American Airlines, lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 66 7/8 and Delta shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 . On the Nasdaq, Dell Computer advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 27 1/8 after better than expected earnings for the third quarter. Technology Solutions added Dollars 1 at Dollars 9 after its directors approved a stock repurchase plan. Canada Toronto showed no clear trend in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index, after Monday's drop, closed 9.9 ahead at 4,180.2, but falls led rises by 423 to 383 after volume of 57.6m shares valued at CDollars 709.8m.

The Chang Jiang River, China's longest, flows across Jiangsu  and cuts by Nanjing, capital of the province, and Zhenjiang,  Yangzhou, Nantong, Changzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou Cities, to form a  belt which covers an area more than 400 km in length and 100 km  in width.    This area has seven open ports which have more than 20  berths  able to accommodate ships of at least 10,000 dwt [deadweight  ton].    With thousands of industrial enterprises, it generates about  80 percent of the gross domestic product in the province.    Since 1991 Jiangsu has invested billions of yuan in building  up the industrial belt along the valley.    So far, the seven cities in the valley have formed a chain  of  modern industrial installations, covering raw materials, energy  development, processing and high-tech. They account for one  tenth of the country's total industrial output.    In addition, these cities boast complete telecommunications  and transportation networks.    A provincial official in charge of the economy said that  Jiangsu has opened eight state development and bonded zones, as  well as international tourism and holiday areas over the past  few years.    Investors from more than 100 countries and regions are  busily  setting up enterprises or exploring land for development.    A survey shows that the provincial government has approved  the establishment of 18,000 foreign-funded enterprises,  involving a total investment of more than 16 billion U.S.  dollars. Included are over 60 noted trans-national corporations.    Meanwhile, China's first high-tech industrial chain has  opened in the Jiangsu section of the Chang Jiang River Valley.    With a total area of 38.38 sq [square] km, the chain  includes  four high-tech industrial zones in Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi and  Changzhou, respectively. The chain also houses more than 700  high- tech project?nvolved in the fields of electronic  information, the combination of machinery and electrical  appliances, new materials and bio-engineering.    The Suzhou High-Tech Industrial Development Zone has more  than 100 projects run by both Chinese and foreign investors.  Each of the projects has an investment topping 10 million U.S.  dollars.    According to the official, about 100,000 rural industrial  enterprises in the Chang Jiang River Valley in the province are  paying attention to upgrading themselves technically.    The technology and equipment of more than one half of them  have reached the advanced Chinese standard and even  internationally in some cases. One tenth of them have  co-operated with overseas business people in forms of joint  ventures or technical co- operation.    According to the latest statistics, the annual industrial  output value generated by rural industrial enterprises in five  counties, including Wuxi, Jiangjin and Wujin, in the river  valley has surpassed 20 billion yuan each, ranking them among  the leaders in the country.    One new feature is the Sino-Singapore joint development of  the Suzhou Industrial Park.    The two sides have decided to spend 20 billion yuan on  developing a 70-sq-km area into a industrial park consisting of  a modern industrial zone, a high-tech zone, an industrial  processing zone and an industrial town.    So far, the park has concluded contracts on building more  than 60 projects with Singapore, involving a total of 1.6  billion U.S. dollars.     "

The world still is feeling the aftershock of a tremendous  historical change which effectively ended the structure built by  the East-West Cold War. Regional conflicts are breaking out in  various areas of the world. Finally freed from the problem of  military security, the United States and Western European  countries are giving their domestic economic issues their first  priority. Triggered by the worldwide economic recession, these  countries are moving toward regionalist and protectionist  economy. Thus economic frictions increasingly are becoming  acute. In spite of this, Japan was strongly urged to maintain  and strengthen its free-trade system, to assist in the recovery  of world economy, and to play a leading role in dealing with  problems on a global scale, including those of global  environment, in a responsible manner.    The Japanese economy, however, is far from robust, as  indicated by weak consumer spending and drastic cutbacks  business is making in capital investment. Combined with these is  some worrisome turn of events, such as the drastic rise in the  value of the yen, which further exacerbates our recessionary  economy. Judging from the maturity of the Japanese market,  combined with the clouded future outlook and the sense of being  blocked in, it now appears that it will be a long time before  the Japanese economy can come out of the recession. These  conditions may eventually affect the industry's RD divisions  hitherto considered sacred. Moreover, with the rising value of  the yen, Japanese companies are increasingly moving their  manufacturing bases abroad, creating concern for eventual  deindustriarization of Japan. The question we face now is one of  how Japan can maintain its technological base which thus far has  supported its economic development.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is keenly  aware of the importance of Japan's role as a leading member of  the international community in achieving full economic recovery  and in meeting the challenge of the 21st century, full of  vitality and richness, while overcoming restraining factors of  aging society and the problem of energy versus environment.  Our future actions will be focused on the theme of ""a  contribution to outside world and a reform within Japan."" In  other words, we will be reviewing the past economic structure  and be prepared to endure the pains accompanying such a reform  in part. It is important that we take down ""creatively"" the  existing systems suffering from structural fatigue so that,  through change and investment, we can achieve further economic  development.    It is especially essential for Japan to open up a new  industrial field and maintain its vitality. In order to achieve  this, we must promote original basic RD, searching for  technical seeds which will be the ""seed"" of a new industry.  Original basic RD will enable Japan to contribute not only  to  its own economic and technological development but also to  international development, as well, by dispatching to the rest  of the world the knowledge gained.    Moreover, in dealing from the overall standpoint with global  environmental problems and the limits imposed by resource and  energy, we feel that our solution to these problems must be  based on the findings of RD. It will be necessary to  transfer  energy and environment technologies that will be developed by  Japan to other countries.    To be in line with MITI's basic policies, AIST has built up  its RD systems by the following means: (1) the creation of  the  Industrial Science and Technology RD System by combining the  existing Large-Scale Industrial Technology RD System with  the  RD Project of Basic Technologies for Energy and Industrial  Technology Development Future Industries; and (2) creation of  Exploratory Energy and Environment Technology Development  Project (New Sunshine Project) by combining the New Energy  Technology RD (Sunshine Project), the Energy Conservation  Technology RD (Moonlight Project), and the Research  Institute  of Innovative Technologies for the Earth (RITE). Moreover, we  have changed the designation of each region's industrial  technology test laboratory to governmental industrial technology  research institute and, at the same time, reorganized and  improved its research setup. Moreover, with the enactment and  enforcement of laws regulating the RD of ""medical welfare  equipment and tools"" and promotion of their use, we have put  into effect a new policy designed to aid private sectors engaged  in the RD of ""medical welfare equipment and tools.""    For fiscal 1995, AIST will continue pursuing the following  measures designed to deal with both international and domestic  problems mentioned previously.    First of all, in order to strengthen the structure of the  RD  systems, we will continue to work on the industrial science and  technology research and development guidelines which both  generally and specifically present the direction and course of  RD which MITI will pursue. Moreover, we will continue  improving  AIST's research facilities and equipment so that solid  advancement will be made in the fields of creative basic RD  and  the research undertaking closely connected to people's  livelihood.    Secondly, we will work on achieving full capabilities of our  industrial science and technology RD systems. The creative  basic RD; the New Sunshine Project designed to deal with  energy  and global environmental problems in appropriate fashion;  RD of  medical welfare equipment and machinery, a type of RD  designed  to achieve comfort and abundance in life, will be conducted  under the government research institutes and industrial science  and technology RD system (more commonly known as the  ""industrial technology system""). Moreover, we will pursue the  type of research and development using excellent regional art  and craft technology. We will continue to promote regional  large-scale projects and other regional technology RD aiming  for the establishment of a unique industrial technological  foundation. Also, under the industrial technology system now  entering upon its second year, we are planning to start a new  RD project on ""synergy ceramics.""    Thirdly, in order to ensure the medium- and long-range  development bases, we will support the private sector's  industrial technology developments. We will promote RD  through  financial investments and a system of taxation. In order to step  up the private sector's experimental research in basic  technology, we will provide support through the Japan Key  Technology Center. We will also continue to work on a measure  designed to support small- and medium-sized businesses' unique  technology development which will emerge as Japan's next  generation of industries.    Fourthly, we will reorganize and improve Japan's RD  foundations. In order to step up the type of RD efforts  extending throughout Japan, we must improve industrial  technology networks through which research manpower and research  data can be obtained. Moreover, in order to carry out RD  effectively, as a preliminary step, we will conduct basic  research for the purpose of providing guidance. Moreover, we  will proceed with the reorganization of the research system  dealing with the foundation of standards, aimed at achieving the  kind of society which will provide people with a comfortable and  enriched lifestyle as well as a harmonious environment. The  reorganization of the system used in the preservation and  creative utilization of the industrial technological history so  that the historical materials can be put to use in training of  superior research personnel.    Finally, international research cooperation through the  advancement of international joint research projects involving  the United States and other advanced countries, developing  nations, the former Soviet Union, and eastern European  countries; the Human Frontier Science Program; and the Subsidies  for International RD Cooperation (funded by a NEDO grant).  Moreover, we will continue working on a measure which will  enable us to actively cooperate with the OECD Commission on  Science and Technology Policy (CSTP) to achieve an  internationally harmonious technological policy.    At the risk of sounding repetitive, let me say that the  establishment of new industrial science technology will be  crucial to the construction of a foundation for the medium- and  long-range developments, without which it would be difficult to  make both Japan and the rest of the world a place of vitality  and abundance. Consequently, under the cooperation of  industrial, academic, and governmental sectors, it will be  extremely important for us to make every effort to advance the  basic RD involving Japan and never to backpedal it.    Through the enforcement of these policies, I wish to fulfill  my heavy responsibility as the director general of AIST. Your  understanding and cooperation in this connection will be greatly  appreciated. I wish you all a happy and prosperous New Year.     "
0,FT943-13723 ,"FT943-13723 _AN-EGRD8AFGFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (23): Two taxing conditions - Manufacturing industry      By TONY HAWKINS   In the new South Africa, manufacturing industry must fulfil two taxing conditions. Growth must be both export-led and labour-intensive. Marrying these two goals is not going to be easy. South Africa is not a low-cost country - more a high-wage, low productivity one - and its competitive advantage stems primarily from the combination of a rich resource base and highly capital-intensive, value-adding activities. The numbers tell their own story; in 1990, base metals, chemicals and metal products accounted for 58 per cent of manufactured exports, while almost three quarters were classified as 'resource-based'. In part, as trade theory predicts, this reflects South Africa's resource endowment, but two policy elements - forward cover for exports and tax incentives for 'beneficiation' industries, adding value to minerals, also contributed. Since the 1920s, industrial growth has been driven by import substitution behind high tariff and protective walls. In the past decade, however, the emphasis has changed as domestic recession pushed more and more companies into the export market. Despite sanctions, exports of manufactures grew 10 per cent a year between 1984 and 1990 - nearly three times faster than in the 1970s. Indeed, since 1972, exports have grown twice as fast as production - 6 per cent as against 2.6 per cent for output. Five industrial sectors - foods, industrial chemicals, steel, non-ferrous metals and metal products - make up almost two thirds of total manufactured exports but in recent years non-traditional exports - furniture, jewellery, rubber and plastics, and cars - have expanded strongly as business was forced to seek market opportunities abroad. On the face of it, this ought to make cheerful reading for Pretoria's policymakers. Industrial exports that performed so impressively under sanctions should surely do far better now, not just because sanctions have gone, but also because supplyside reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness are in train. These reforms take two main forms. First, political transition and the thrust of the RDP which, between them, should both improve substantially the industrial relations environment, while boosting productivity, on the strength of increased spending on education and training. The second is the pronounced and continuing shift in trade policy, underlined by tariff reform and the commitment to more export-friendly strategies. South Africa's extremely complex and skewed tariff system is being reformed as part of the country's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade submission under the Uruguay round. From next January, tariffs will be lowered and rationalised over a five-year period, with longer phase-in periods and higher protection for 'sensitive' industries, most notably clothing and textiles and vehicle assembly. Although South African manufacturing has not been over-protected - according to the World Bank the average tariff is about average for a developing country, although very high by first world standards - the dispersion, complexity and instability of the system have undermined economic efficiency. The net effect has been a heavy bias against exports, two- thirds of which stems from the higher input prices that industry must pay for manufactured inputs. The South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) estimates that manufacturing costs are 15 per cent above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average, mainly because South African companies pay a quarter more for their inputs than their first-world competitors, but also because both the cost of capital and labour costs, adjusted for productivity, are higher. From next January, this will start to change. The number of tariff rates will be reduced from more than 100 to just six, ranging from 0 per cent to 30 per cent, lowering the average tariff to 15per cent. The frequent discretionary changes in the system that have been the norm, will no longer be possible. The World Bank says that the General Export Incentive Scheme which, until the 1994 budget, provided tax-free financial subsidies to exporters, provided a subsidy of nearly 17 per cent of the value of export. The subsidy, costing some R2bn annually, applies to most exports, increasing with the degree of value added. The Bank warns that manufacturing industry's recent impressive export growth is unlikely to be maintained, when it is phased out, probably by the end of 1997. Crucial to the export drive will be a new system of incentives - by way of exemptions and duty-drawbacks - improved mechanisms for providing pre- and post-shipment export finance, and linking training and research and development assistance to export-oriented companies. The underlying strategy is a reversal of past performance, shifting from a situation in which export sales are a residual after satisfying the home market, to one in which domestic market sales play second fiddle to exports. How tariff reform and export incentives will play out in terms of their impact on manufacturing will only become clear towards the end of the decade. The Industrial Development Corporation, using a macroeconomic model borrowed from the Australians, has calculated that Gatt submission will have a positive impact, albeit only a minor one. Its model, criticised on technical grounds by some private sector economists, estimates that tariff reform will increase gross domestic product by only 0.7 per cent - a one-off impact - while lowering inflation 1 per cent, raising employment 1 per cent, exports 1.2 per cent, and imports 2.5 per cent. The magnitude of these calculations suggests that the impact of Gatt on the South African economy is being oversold. This, however, ignores the qualitative implications in terms of transforming an inward-looking into an outward-oriented manufacturing sector, with significant gains in terms of technology, skills and productivity. Nor do such macro calculations capture the impact of restructuring. Two sensitive industries - cars and clothing and textiles - face a potentially traumatic transitional phase during which some companies will have to close, jobs will be lost and significant government financial support will be needed, for retraining and possibly for redundancy benefits. The motor industry, with seven assemblers, faces far-reaching structural change. The number of models produced will shrink, exports will loom larger as protection phases down over the next seven or eight years to 45 per cent from 110 per cent at present, and - in all probability - two or even three of the existing manufacturers will close or merge with a local competitor. Just what this will mean for employment is unclear at this stage, but there is an influential lobby in business, with some support from the World Bank, for further exchange rate depreciation. This would make exporting more profitable, generating investment and jobs, while giving import substitution industries at least a temporary respite in coming to terms with enhanced competition from abroad. Greater outward orientation of the economy from 1995 might be an engine of growth, according to the World Bank, though not, it warns of (direct) employment generation. A Bank research paper comes down in favour of a three-pronged approach - fostering growth in a small number of selected subsectors, which sounds suspiciously like picking winners, usually frowned upon in Bank orthodoxy; linking support to export performance; and supporting employment generation. Crucial to employment growth is a shift away from the capital-intensive self-sufficiency, counter-sanctions, investments of the 1970s and 1980s, to smaller-scale, export-oriented, job-intensive investment. A potential snag is the ANC's opposition to Asian-style low-wage, sweat-shop industrialisation. The new government is looking for the best of both worlds - labour-intensity but at wage levels above those found in competitive economies. Naively, in a world in which employment growth has been decoupled from output expansion, the World Bank's best scenario for South Africa assumes a return to capital-labour relationships that existed 25 years ago. Only the optimists believe that this will happen. A more likely outcome is greater job creation in manufacturing, especially the small scale sector, though at nothing like the rate necessary to defuse the unemployment crisis.

Although some of these investments have been in the pipeline for some time, their announcement - timed to coincide with the conference - served to underline the forum's success. The organiser, the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland, said it was well pleased with the event. More than 300 delegates attended, including a large delegation from the US accompanying Mr Ron Brown, the country's secretary for commerce, who addressed the conference. The investments confirmed yesterday were: Du Pont of the US is spending Pounds 13.5m on developing prototype technologies at its Lycra facility in Londonderry, bringing its investment in research there to Pounds 38m in the past three years. Du Pont employs 1,000 production staff in Londonderry. Ford, the US motor group, which has had a presence in Belfast for 30 years, is to invest Pounds 15m in the production of new engine components. Nacco Materials Handling of the US will be investing Pounds 11m at Craigavon, consolidating the plant's position as a source for its new range of Hyster and Yale forklift trucks. More than 100 extra jobs will be created by 1996. British Telecommunications is to invest Pounds 30m in a new office block at Laganside in Belfast and a further Pounds 1.5m in expanding its customer services centre at Enniskillen, providing 113 new jobs. Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said the investment would be in addition to the Pounds 30m BT expects to invest in Northern Ireland in the coming year. Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics group, which is already established in County Antrim, is to build a Pounds 3.5m factory at Springvale Business Park in west Belfast which could create 100 new jobs. A shadow hanging over the conference in the shape of a possible boycott by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, evaporated when Sinn Fein councillors arrived at the Europa Hotel early yesterday morning and began to lobby delegates over the province's economic future. They subsequently took seats in the conference hall and listened to some of the speeches before walking out. One potential US investor, however, criticised the treatment of Sinn Fein. Mr Alan Hevesi, the New York City comptroller - who controls a Dollars 50bn (Pounds 30.4bn) pension fund - said that Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, should have been invited to the conference. He said that exclusion of 'a representation of a substantial portion of the population' from the conference was 'a mistake on the part of the British government'. After the conference Mr Major visited the site of the new BT office block in Laganside. He later went with his wife Norma to the centre of Portadown, which was devastated 19 months ago by an IRA bomb. The Majors were given a warm welcome as they walked through the central shopping district. They then visited the local Royal Ulster Constabulary headquarters.

The seasonally adjusted production  index for the mining and manufacturing sectors stood at 92.1  against a base of 100 for 1990, MITI announced in a preliminary  report.    The March output growth compares with a 0.1 percent dip  registered in February.    A production outlook index for the manufacturing sector  indicates falls both in April and May.    Uncertainty shadows the future course of final demand,  necessitating close watch of coming developments, MITI said,  repeating wording used in the February report.    Shipments increased 4.4 percent in March for the index of  95.0, following a 1.1 percent growth in February.    The inventory index dropped 1.7 percent to 105.0, following  a  1.0 percent decrease in the previous month.    The March inventory-to-sales ratio fell 6.0 percent against  a  2.7 percent decrease in February, with the index standing at  111.9.    On an unadjusted basis, industrial production in March slid  3.1 percent from a year earlier, stretching a record string of  year-to-year declines to 30 months.    With the latest statistics, Japan's industrial output has  shown considerable fluctuation over the eight months prior to  the reporting month.    Koichi Yoshimoto, chief of the ministry's Statistics  Analysis  Division, told a press conference that the basic undertone of  both industrial output and shipment is still weak although  bright spots are being detected in some sectors such as  household electric appliances and housing purchases.    The 4.0 percent growth in the March output, the highest  since  a 4.2 percent gain registered in September 1992, chiefly  resulted from seasonal factors toward the end of fiscal 1993,  Yoshimoto said. ""It is too early to declare Japan's economy has  hit bottom,"" he said.    In March, production in all the 14 industrial sectors  covered  by the survey, except chemicals, scored gains from the preceding  month, MITI said.    Electric machinery such as air conditioners made a great  contribution to boosting March industrial output along with  transport vehicles such as passenger cars, MITI said.    Shipments for the month rose in all 14 sectors, with  electrical and passenger cars marking substantial increases.    The production and shipment indexes rose above 90 for the  first time since September. But the ministry forecast a 2.7  percent production decline for the manufacturing sector in April  and a 2.4 percent decline in May.    Demand for machinery will probably drop in these months in  reaction to sharp increases in the January-March period,  Yoshimoto explained.    The inventory index fell in March for the third month in a  row, thanks to smooth inventory adjustment in ordinary passenger  cars, Yoshimoto said. Volume adjustment of corporate  inventories is progressing steadily but the inventory-to-sales  ratio of 111.9 for March is still high, Yoshimoto said, noting  the slow growth of shipments. Corporate managers must feel a  surplus of inventories, he said.    Japan's industrial production for the entire year in fiscal  1993 fell 4.1 percent from the previous year while shipments  decreased by 3.7 percent.    Both industrial output and shipments thus registered  declines  for three consecutive years, a first for Japan. In the past,  two years of decline were recorded in fiscal 1974-1975 when  Japan's economy was struggling under the impact of the 1973 oil  crisis.     "

0,FT932-16985 ,"FT932-16985 _AN-DDBB7AF1FT 930402   FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Tokyo bids farewell to the barriers - The Industrial Bank of Japan celebrating broking reforms      By ROBERT THOMSON   Japanese financial institutions were generally unmoved yesterday by the formal start of reforms that will slowly dismantle the barriers between brokers and bankers. At the Industrial Bank of Japan, however, the reaction was altogether much more positive as it prepared to set up a new subsidiary, likely to be known as IBJ Securities. Having underwritten the first batch of Manchurian Railway Bonds in 1907, IBJ has always seen itself as more than a bank, but financial laws were rewritten after the Second World War, strictly limiting its role. IBJ applauds the 1993 reforms partly for what they offer in the future, but also because they restore the identity of the distant past. Mr Susumu Takanohara, IBJ managing director, said that the introduction of the Financial System Reform Act, which became law yesterday, gave the bank 'bright hopes' amid the gloom of financial market turmoil. It also helped the bank to overcome a few embarrassing incidents from the late 1980s, the so-called bubble era, when it cultivated customers, including a famed stock speculator in Osaka, outside its normal range of industrial contacts. 'We have been looking forward to this moment for a long time. We really are very optimistic about our chances,' Mr Takanohara said. He expects IBJ's experience in the Euromarkets and its traditional links to two medium-sized brokers, Wako Securities and New Japan Securities, to give it an advantage in developing its own domestic operations. IBJ has yet to receive formal approval from the finance ministry for its new subsidiary, but the bank is reported to be planning to capitalise IBJ Securities at Y30bn (Dollars 259m) and to provide about 120 staff. The numbers are far larger than the country's two other long-term credit banks, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank, which are also permitted to establish new subsidiaries. LTCB said that the banks wanted access to the stock market, but the ministry had only provided initial permission to underwrite and to deal in bonds. For the indefinite future, they will not be able to handle stocks or to deal in equity-linked bonds, although they will be able to underwrite these issues. 'Our original aim was to have a full menu of services for our customers, and issuing stocks would have been an important service,' LTCB said. The finance ministry has indicated that the restrictions will be reviewed after 'two to three years,' although it has not guaranteed they will be significantly eased. Next year, leading commercial banks are supposed to be granted the same, limited rights to open a securities subsidiary. Tighter than expected restrictions were imposed on the banks at the request of the securities industry, bruised by the collapse of stock prices during the past three years. The Nikkei average, which measures Tokyo stock prices, has recovered during the course of the past three weeks, but most of the 14 largest brokers will report a loss for the fiscal year just ended. Under the new law, brokers are allowed into the trust banking business, and the Big Four houses, Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities, and Yamaichi Securities, have plans for new subsidiaries. Smaller brokers are unlikely to have the resources to expand. Most have recently announced restructuring plans to trim their operations, and trust banking is unlikely to bring quick profits. The Big Four will be limited in their trust banking businesses. They will have access to investment trusts, but not to special large-lot securities trusts, so called tokkin funds, and special loan trusts in which public funds are invested, effectively protecting the territory of the existing trust banks. It is an important principle of reform that a balance be maintained between new opportunities and old players. Nikko, planning a subsidiary capitalised at about Y20bn and with 50 employees, is 'not very optimistic'. It expects the banking industry to gain more from reform: 'The underwriting market will become very tough. We will have to improve product development, and know-how. We can see the market expanding, so there will be more opportunities, but also very severe competition.' The brokers' biggest concern is IBJ, which has links to a majority of companies listed on the first section of the Tokyo exchange. Additional competition will come from Norinchukin, the central agriculture bank, handling funds from farmers and fishermen around the country. It plans to open a securities company with a capital of about Y20bn and 40 employees, increasing to 70 or so after two years. 'We would like to do everything we are allowed to do, such as underwriting, dealing and sales of bonds,' Norinchukin said. The bank too, like IBJ, wants to leave the bubble era behind, as it funded the ailing Nippon Housing Loan, a home loan company turned property speculator. Norinchukin has accepted an interest rate cut from 6 to 4.5 per cent on its estimated exposure of Y157.9bn. Bruises from the bubble era have limited the aspirations of Nippon Credit Bank, the third long-term credit bank. It is overhauling three finance affiliates whose bad loans are running at about 20 per cent of total lending. The bank is entangled in the latest Tokyo political scandal. It has modest plans for a new subsidiary with capital of about Y2bn and about 10 employees.   Companies:-  Industrial Bank of Japan.     Nomura Securities.     Daiwa Securities.

This rule also revises the countries that are included in Country Groups V, W, and Y and amends the special country policies provisions in the EAR to reflect the changes in licensing policy for the countries that have been moved from one country group to another.     This rule amends the documentation requirements provisions of the EAR to substitute the Form BXA629P (Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser) for the Yugoslav End-Use Certificate requirement. Finally, this rule amends the documentation requirements provisions in the EAR to implement Import Certificate/Delivery Verification (IC/DV) procedures for Bulgaria and Romania.             DATES:         Effective date    : This rule is effective May 9, 1994.             Grace period    : A 60-day grace period will apply to the requirement to obtain a Bulgarian or Romanian Import Certificate in support of export or reexport license applications. During the grace period, applications will be accepted when supported by either a Form BXA629P (Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser) or a Bulgarian or Romanian Import Certificate.               FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:       For questions of a technical nature, the following persons in the Office of Technology and Policy Analysis are available:            Category 1: Jeff Tripp_(202) 4821309     Category 2: Surendra Dhir_(202) 4825695     Category 3: Robert Lerner_(202) 4821641     Category 4: Joseph Young_(202) 4820706     Category 5: Dale Jensen_(202) 4820730     Category 6: Joseph Chuchla_(202) 4821641     Categories 7 and 9: Bruce Webb_(202) 4823806     Category 8: Steve Clagett_(202) 4823550            For information on Import Certificate/Delivery Verification (IC/DV) Procedures for Bulgaria and Romania and changes in Country Groups and country policies, contact Rodney Joseph, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis,   Telephone: (202) 4820171.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Background         This final rule revises new General License GLX (59 FR 15621) to resolve certain ambiguities and to reflect changes in national security controls. For instance, Supplement No. 1 to part 771 is revised to delete 4A03.c and 4A03.b because the paragraph references are now incorrect and new Administrative Exception Notes make listing on the Supplement unnecessary.     This rule amends a number of ECCNs in the Commerce Control List (CCL) to conform with recent changes in the COCOM International Industrial List (IL). ECCN 3A01.a.3 is revised to control ``microprocessor microcircuits'', ``microcomputer microcircuits'', and microcontroller microcircuits that:              "

Indeed, Mr Reg Scaife and his colleagues in the UK Industrial Sugar Users Group confess to being middle-aged or older and in many cases completely new to information technology. Yet they now regularly dial into the CIX public bulletin board system to share the latest news from Brussels and electronically discuss topics planned for their next meeting, writes John Kavanagh. The Industrial Sugar Users Group consists of 55 companies such as Cadbury, Mars and Nestle, plus five trade associations, including the British Soft Drinks Association and the Ice Cream Federation. These organisations account for well over half the UK's sugar consumption. Reg Scaife is the group's secretary. He is a keen PC user and got hooked on CIX in 1991 when he discovered it was a good source of advice on office systems. He often leaves queries and finds that suppliers and other users key in their suggestions. Mr Scaife saw that a bulletin board system could benefit the Industrial Sugar Users Group. With members' agreement he created a private conference on CIX, open only to group members. 'We felt that things needed to be done more quickly but at the same time dragging everyone to London for emergency meetings was not ideal,' he says. 'Even using the telephone and fax is time-consuming and frustrating and you're never certain if someone has received a message. 'We can now cope with emergencies. For example if a Brussels announcement demands a quick response or a statement to the press, we can clear it with the group's officers very quickly. 'In addition, we have more productive meetings. A bulletin board system can't replace face-to-face meetings but our three or four meetings a year are now better prepared. We discuss issues beforehand through CIX, so our meetings concentrate on the topics which have emerged as most important,' he adds. Minutes are available through CIX almost immediately afterwards. In addition, when Mr Scaife attends an EC meeting in Brussels he prepares a report on his PC and transmits it to CIX before going to bed - 'one of our members starts work at 7am, so he can see a report on yesterday's Brussels meeting as soon as he gets in,' Mr Scaife says. The system depends to an extent on people disciplining themselves to dial in regularly - 'one benefit is that you can choose to look at your messages when it fits in with what you're doing, whereas the phone forces you to stop and deal with the call,' Reg Scaife says. 'However, this does mean that if things go quiet for a fortnight, people slacken off logging in. I try to keep them in the habit by putting in news relating to the industry.' Connection charges have been cut dramatically by the use of a software product known as an off-line reader. Without such products, users have to key in text and read messages while on-line, incurring hefty connection charges and telephone costs. An off-line reader enables a user to prepare text beforehand and send it in one burst; the reader also retrieves messages and stores them on the user's own computer disc. The off-line readers used as standard by the sugar users group are from Ashmount Research: Telepathy for those using the DOS operating system and Wigwam for those with Microsoft Windows. These products also organise incoming messages into a database for easier reference. Reg Scaife says using Wigwam has cut his CIX and associated telephone charges from Pounds 60 to Pounds 17 a month, even though his use of the system has increased. Despite the amount of text he sends and receives, he is rarely on-line for more than two minutes. Compulink Information Exchange This product, CIX, is a public bulletin board, conference system and electronic mail service. Private conferences can also be set up. CIX enables users to send faxes from their personal computers. It also provides a link to the world-wide Internet service. Supplier: Compulink Information Exchange, a UK company formed in 1987 with the sole business of running the service. Number of users: CIX says 'tens of thousands.' Price: Pounds 25 registration fee, then connection charges of 6p per minute at peak rate and 4p off peak, plus VAT. There are also the standard telephone charges.

The 28-month study of 1,000 10-year-olds, conducted by Kauko Makinen of the University of Michigan Dental School, showed that children who regularly chewed xylitol-sweetened gum had half the new cavities of children who chewed gum containing rival sweeteners. The research was sponsored by Leaf, of Finland, which makes gum containing xylitol. Xylitol is found in fruits and plants and produced commercially from birchwood.

0,FT942-7946 ,"FT942-7946 _AN-EEWDFAEEFT 940523   FT  23 MAY 94 / International Company News: Japanese chemical groups hit hard      By PAUL ABRAHAMS      TOKYO   Results from Japan's largest petrochemicals companies for the year to March 31 reflect the crisis facing a sector plagued by sluggish domestic demand, overcapacity, plunging prices and the appreciation of the yen. News of the sector's dire trading position follow this week's decision by Showa Denko to sell its polystyrene business. The company, a marginal manufacturer, sold its 30,000 tonnes a year Kawasaki plant to Asahi Chemical, Japan's largest polystyrene manufacturer with capacity of about 333,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to about 25 per cent of the market. The move was the latest in a series of alliances and mergers as the troubled industry restructures. Mitsubishi Petrochemical, the country's biggest plastics group, reported a loss of Y8.39bn (Dollars 80m) compared with pre-tax profits last year of Y8.25bn. The group made an operating loss of Y13.8bn, the first since 1982. The poor result came despite cost-cutting measures, lower raw material prices, and Y4bn worth of profits from equity sales. Turnover fell 12.2 per cent from Y372bn to Y326bn, as prices and volumes declined. Earnings per share, which reached Y52.5 in 1991, fell to a loss per share of Y9.44. The group, which is scheduled to merge with Mitsubishi Kasei on October 1, cut its dividend from Y8 per share to Y4. Mitsubishi Kasei's pre-tax profits fell 76.8 per cent from Y9.3bn last year to Y2.2bn. The group reported its first operating loss in 40 years at Y467m, and only managed to post positive pre-tax results by selling Y15.7bn worth of equities. Turnover fell 1.8 per cent, the fourth yearly decline, to Y696bn. The dividend was halved to Y3 per share. Mr Morihisa Takano, managing director, said the newly merged group would generate pre-tax profits of Y10bn on sales of Y855bn during the year to March 1995. He predicted petrochemicals prices would bottom out during the summer. No decision had been made about the dividend, but the new company could pass it during the current year, he warned. Pre-tax profits at Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Japan's biggest polyethylene maker, plunged 75 per cent from Y9bn to Y2.26bn on sales down 9.3 per cent at Y272bn. The company blamed poor demand for the slump which offset the benefits of cost-cutting measures. The dividend is unchanged at Y6 per share. The group forecast pre-tax profits for the current year marginally up at Y3bn on turnover of Y276bn. Shin-Etsu, one of Japan's biggest makers of polyvinyl chloride, reported profits down 26.1 per cent from Y17.6bn to Y13bn. Sales increased 0.2 per cent from Y275bn to Y276bn. Net profits fell 26.6 per cent to Y7.08bn, or Y21.85 per share. The group maintained the final dividend at Y3.75, making the full-year payout Y7.5 per share. Shin-Etsu forecast pre-tax profits for the current year of Y15.5bn on sales of Y277bn. The outlook for the petrochemicals industry remains bleak. The imbalance between supply and demand for ethylene, the basic building block of petrochemicals, is about 2.8m tonnes of ethylene and is set to deteriorate further this year. A massive 700,000-tonne-a-year ethylene complex owned by Maruzen, Mitsui Petrochemical and Sumitomo Chemical comes on stream later this year and Mitsubishi Petrochemical is also commissioning a new 300,000-tonne-a-year plant this year.

0,FT931-5120 ,"FT931-5120 _AN-DCHCJABMFT 930308   FT  08 MAR 93 / Chemical dreams turn to ashes      By PAUL ABRAHAMS   THE UK chemical industry is proud of its trade record. Over the past decade chemical manufacturers have produced consistent trade-balance surpluses. But for how much longer? The balance in chemicals is already deteriorating and the long-term outlook is bleak. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer of ICI, said: 'It just does not make sense manufacturing bulk chemicals in the UK any more.' In 1980 exports of chemicals, excluding pharmaceuticals, exceeded imports by 55 per cent. Last year the surplus was only about 20 per cent. The decisive moment came in the early 1980s. The worldwide recession meant that growth rates in plastics slowed rapidly, leading to heavy overproduction and steep losses. Europe's petrochemicals and plastics capacity was cut by about 25 per cent, and British companies took more than their share of the pain. ICI closed two ethylene processing plants, Shell closed another and Monsanto closed its low-density polyethylene plant at Fawley, Hampshire. For each, the closures made sense. But when the economy picked up in the mid 1980s there was a surge in imports because domestic production could not meet demand. It was worst in the PVC market. The construction boom sucked in imports of products such as PVC pipes and windows to meet demand during the mid and late 1980s. Export tonnage of PVC halved between 1980 and 1991 while imports trebled. Although some new capacity came on stream import penetration continued during the late 1980s, only to be halted by the recession. Since then British chemical companies have endured cuts in jobs and capacity. ICI, for example, was cutting staff before German chemical groups admitted that the European economy was slowing. The group has cut its staff by 21,000 since 1990 and more redundancies have been announced. Traditionally, UK-based chemical groups try to export their way out of trouble. Mr Ian Fyfe, a director of the UK subsidiary of the BASF chemical group of Germany, estimated that the industry's exports as a proportion of sales rose from 35 per cent in 1977 to 48 per cent in 1985. British companies, however, do not need to service their customers from a UK base. Most are building plants near their new customers in the US, continental Europe or in Asia. ICI, for example, authorised capital expenditure of Pounds 3.5bn in the UK between 1981 and 1991, but spent Pounds 7.6bn outside Britain in the same period. In the short-term, the UK industry's surplus is expected to improve. According to the Chemical Industries Association, the UK trade body, the devaluation of sterling will also help the trade balance to increase over the next 12 months. The long-term future is far bleaker. If the industry is to halt or even slow its decline it must restructure - moving away from commodity products and into niches. If a success is not made of such products the trade surplus could turn negative, sending the industry down the same path as the shipbuilding and textile sectors.

From Mr RUSSELL SPARKES   Sir, Is it not typical of the government's bad luck (or poor judgment) that just as the controversial Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant is about to start, a story in the FT ('Plutonium plan may be suspended', February 24) reports how the Japanese government is about to suspend its plutonium recycling programme and, with it, Thorp's major customer? The FT also mentioned the French government's decision to cease the production of electricity (and plutonium waste) at its Superphenix fast breeder reactor ('Utilities could sue over reactor', February 24). The two countries normally described as having made a success of nuclear power are clearly having second thoughts.

The survey, which compared international gas prices, was conducted by National Utility Services, a company which advises businesses on ways to control utility costs. It noted that British Gas's monopoly over the residential market had allowed it to offer very low prices to industrial users willing to have their supplies interrupted during periods of peak demand. But the company said the removal of the monopoly, as recommended recently by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, could lead to price rises for large users in the short term.

Today, accompanied by Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, Song Jian  visited the work site of the Land Information Industry Base  inside the New Technology Industrial Development and  Experimental Zone in Beijing and discussed with entrepreneurs  from privately-run science and technology enterprises. Before  discussions got underway, Song Jian extended Spring Festival  greetings to the entrepreneurs on behalf of the State Council  and the State Science and Technology Commission. He said  management at the Beijing Experimental Zone, by taking advantage  of the state's preferential policy and by adopting an flexible  operating mechanism, has seen rapid development in the zone. In  it there were now a number of science and technology enterprises  including the Stone Group, Lianxiang, Fangzheng, Jinghai,  Huasheng, Huake which had attracted attention both inside and  outside China. The Beijing Experimental Zone was taking the  lead among the nation's 52 science and technology development  zones.    Song Jian said one of the results of China's reform of the  science and technology structure was the vigorous search for and  development of different types of privately run science and  technology enterprises. Privately run science and technology  enterprises, which had emerged in large numbers lately, had  become the driving force for developing the cause of science and  technology and for the science and technology industry, and had  become an important part of the socialist market economy.  Private operations would remain the main form of enterprise in  China's science and technology development zones in the future.  The state would continue to work toward the rapid development  of big, privately run enterprises engaged in the development of  new and high technology.    Song Jian also expressed the hope that operators of  privately  run enterprises, as commanders of the ""field army"" of China's  rising science and technology industry, would work out  strategies and be prepared to wage a major campaign. For  privately run enterprises to develop, it was necessary for them  to persist in developing high technology; to train their own  research and development personnel; to rely on science and  technology to get ahead of others in market competition; to  maintain and develop superiority; to rapidly expand production  and scale of operation and enhance economic strength; to develop  the international market and take part in international  competition through cooperation with financial institutions and  with domestic or foreign counterparts; to further improve  enterprise management; to study advanced foreign management  theories, systems, and methods; and to train professional  management personnel so that the production and operation of  enterprises would be adapted to the requirements of socialist  production.    In conclusion, Song Jian said that to promote the  development  of high technology industry, and to bring about the launch of  China's national economy mainly through reliance on the new and  high technology industry, the state would adopt measures to  create a more relaxed environment for the development of new and  high technology industry development zones and encourage more  scientists and technicians, scientific research institutes, and  institutes of higher education to run private high technology  enterprises.

Sales, which rose 34 per cent to ADollars 2.3bn, were lifted mainly by the company's rural trading operations and its fertiliser and building products units. The overall improvement in Australian agriculture and a large contribution from Dalgety Farmers more than doubled the rural trading division's revenue and contributed strongly to group profits. The company forecast further growth in earnings as its expansion activities and acquisition of businesses start to pay off. It said it would spend about ADollars 200m on new capital projects.

Shi Wanpeng believes that in 1993 the overall movement of  the  economy was in a good direction, and this was primarily  manifested in the following:    Industrial production grew rapidly. In 1993 for the country  as a whole the village level and above village level total  industrial output value was 3.5074 trillion yuan, an increase of  23.6 percent in comparison to the previous year, was greatest  increase in the 15-year period since reform and opening. Of this  total, the increase for state-owned industry was 8.9 percent,  light industry increased 22.3 percent, and heavy industry was up  24.8 percent. In addition, there was a new increase in  production of a set of major industrial products related to the  national economy and the people's livelihood.    Industrial product sales were brisk, and the production and  marketing rate increased. For the year as a whole, the  industrial product marketing rate reached 96.4 percent, an  increase of 0.9 percent over the previous year. The industrial  product marketing rate from November on showed a marked  acceleration, and in December the production and marketing rate  reached 109.86 percent.    Urban and rural markets were thriving and active. For the  year as a whole, the total retail value of commodities in the  society increased by 23.6 percent, and in December the increase  was 35.3 percent. Rural markets rose relatively quickly, and the  difference in the expansion of rural and urban markets for the  first half of the year of 10.4 percent dropped for the year as a  whole to 6.4 percent.    The situation involving a shortage of enterprise funds was  ameliorated. From September 1993 on, the industrial operating  funds and loans showed a marked increase. From September to  December the total new increase in industrial operating funds  and loans reached 97.5 billion yuan, while for the whole year  the new increases in the industrial operating funds and loans  reached 139.8 billion yuan.    Grain market prices have basically been controlled. At the  end of last year, a situation of price rises emerged in some  areas in the grain market. The State Council in a timely manner  took measures involving the utilization of state grain reserves  to stabilize prices, and at present grain market prices have  basically been controlled.    In talking about the trends of current economic movement,  Comrade Shi believes that due to some new conditions that have  emerged since last November, the current economic environment is  not hospitable. This is primarily manifested in:    The market price situation is grim, though trends for  reversing this are gaining strength. In 1993, the retail price  inflation in the society as a whole from March on doubled, and  for the year as a whole was predicted to increase roughly 13  percent. City and rural prices had the same level of increase,  and the rural price expansion for the year as a whole was  predicted to reached 12.5 percent; household living expense  price expansion reached 14.5 percent, among which for 35 big  cities the increase reached 19.6 percent.    The scale of fixed capital investment was too large, and had  an irrational structure. In 1993, fixed capital investment was  able to reach 1.2 trillion yuan, of which state-owned units  investment increased more than 60 percent; the total scale of  investment involving projects under construction totalled 3.3  trillion yuan, a four fold increased over the previous year, and  the proportion of closing year end unfinished projects reached  57.6 percent. The investment structure was not rational to a  great extent, and the proportion of investment in basic industry  dropped from the first half of the year, at 42.9 percent, down  to 36.9 percent, while the proportion of extended investment  increased from 34.1 percent to 38.6 percent, there was a high  level of consumption, and a great number of leading consumption  projects.    Industrial production for December of last year increased at  an above normal rate. That month, the national village and above  village level industrial production from the high base level of  32.2 percent of the same month the previous year increased by  29.8 percent, or the second highest rate of growth after the  30.2 percent increase of June, while the monthly chain index  increase reached 18.2 percent, a more than 10 percentage point  increase over the normal annual increase. This above normal  increase could give new life to the contradiction of the  shortage of funds.    Increases in mutual arrears among enterprises. According to  Industrial Bank statistics for 40,000 enterprises, at the end of  November 1993, debt owed funds were 341.2 billion yuan, an  increase from earlier in the year of 178.7 billion yuan; while  credit funds were 289.8 billion yuan, an increase of 70.5  billion yuan from early in the year.    The import of some major commodities exceeds planning by a  considerable degree. Among the most prominent of these are steel  products, and petroleum products, while car imports also exceed  planned targets by a substantial margin.    Rail transport is still constrained. In 1993, the volume of  goods transported by railroad was 1.567 billion tons, only a 2.9  increase from the previous year. In 1994, the shortage situation  for the volume of goods transported by rail will not markedly  improve, particularly due to the spring transport time delays,  which will have a major impact on the transport of goods by rail.    When it comes to the new situation currently emerging for  the  movement of the economy, Comrade Shi believes that it is  necessary to treat controlling the scale of fixed capital  investment and price increases as the major tasks to grapple  with, and continue to strengthen and improve macro adjustment,  while steadily realizing an increase in the people's economy in  the process of readjustment.    1. Strengthen guidance towards citizens' psychological  expectations and social consumption. It is necessary to  gradually deepen dissemination of the contents of reforms  dealing with foreign currency and the tax system, and strengthen  guidance of the media, actively launch some directed propaganda,  to increase the understanding of reform of enterprises and broad  numbers of people, remove doubts, and avoid blind action.    2. Strict control and active guidance of fixed capital  investments. When it comes to investment it is necessary to  strictly achieve planning sufficient funding, and not leave  gaps. First, there is strict control of new launching of  construction projects; second, this involves not permitting the  use of operating funds for loans to make investments; third,  this involves the fact that new construction projects must plan  for a sufficient cushion in operating funds, and those that are  insufficient should not be permitted to start work; fourth, this  involves the need to devise a way to fill the gap in funds for  newly completed and operating projects in 1993-1994; fifth, this  involves directing investment and effectively guiding it towards  increasing the society's supply, and improving the production  structure. This is the key to having the new macro regulation  obtain new results.    3. In accordance with market conditions, at present it is  necessary to increase the national special reserves of products  such as grains, edible oils, meats, sugar, and cotton, and for  existing reserve stores to conduct an inventory and checks to  find out what resources are available, and make accounts of  materials tally up.    4. Strengthen management of the import and export of primary  commodities. It is necessary as rapidly as possible to  investigate and promote measures for increasing product exports,  and at the same time it is necessary to properly handle import  regulations for major commodities and goods and materials, such  as steel products, oil, and cars.    5. Serious financial policies and strengthening of financial  management. When it comes to the issue of mutual debt between  enterprises, it is recommended that some provinces and cities or  industry be chosen for deepening of investigation and finding  out about the situation, and researching methods for resolving  issues, and preventing the recurrence of prolonged debt.    Comrade Shi Wanpeng stressed that this year is a year when  the degree of strength of the implementation of various reform  measures will be comparatively large, and properly handling the  immediate macro regulation, improving the production structure,  and increasing the society's effective supply are the key to  smoothly implementing the policy of ""grasping opportunity,  deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining  stability,"" and should draw the sufficient attention of  government at all levels and of responsible economic departments.    At the conclusion of the interview, Comrade Shi expressed  his  hope that the ""Economic Work Newsletter"" would progressively  develop its characteristics such as its broad readership, large  volume of policy information, and its high level of  authoritativeness, while properly handling its propaganda work  in the economic field, truly becoming an intimate friend of  enterprises and responsible economic departments at all levels.

K. Zykov and V. N. Skorobogatykh, DIEKS  [unexpanded acronym]-Scientific Production Association, Central  Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building Technology;  UDC 621.186.7]    [Text] A description is provided of the principal  requirements contained in the Regulations on the System of  Technical Diagnosis of Thermal Power Steam and Hot-Water  Boilers.    Tens of thousands of small steam and hot-water boilers,  supplying communal and industrial needs for steam and hot water  are currently in operation in Russia. The constituents of this  thermomechanical equipment are heterogeneous both in design and  technological features and with respect to product service life,  safety and reliability factors, and other indices. More than  80% of the small boiler units produced before the  beginning of  the 1970s are operating at the present time beyond the limits of  the design operating life. The quality of operation remains a  significant problem for this equipment.    Under these conditions, operational reliability is  determined  entirely by the timely and effective implementation of measures  for the carrying out of technical diagnosis and by subsequent  repair and initial preparation operations. However, until the  present time a unified methodological and engineering approach  to the tasks of diagnosis and to the problem of rational  prolongation of reliable operating life has not been worked out.    Finally, instructional materials on the many modifications  of  small boilers, regulating the necessary scope and periods of the  monitoring of the state of the metal during the period of the  design service life, are lacking.    These problems have been eliminated by the Regulations on  the  System of Technical Diagnosis of Industrial Power Steam and  Hot-Water Boilers, developed by a collective of authors (Russian  Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight; the Scientific  Production Association, Central Scientific Research, I. I.  Polzunov Planning and Design Institute on Boilers and Turbines;  VNIIAM [unexpanded acronym - All-Russian Scientific Research  Institute of Nuclear Machine Building]; the Scientific  Production Association, Central Scientific Research Institute of  Machine Building Technology, boiler-building plants, and other  enterprises). The Regulations cover steam boilers with a  pressure greater than 0.07 MPa to 4.0 MPa and hot-water boilers  with a water-heating temperature greater than 115ëC. The  principle of ensuring safety during the assessment of the  technical status of boilers in relation to potentially dangerous  elements of construction or its components that are most  stressed, operating in the most severe and difficult conditions,  is the basis of the Regulations. The selection of potentially  dangerous components is made on the basis of information on the  design features of the boilers, the conditions of their  operation, and statistical data on their failure rate. The  frequency, methods, and scope of the monitoring of the technical  status of the boilers, as well as the norms of the evaluation of  the limiting condition with respect various diagnostic  parameters, are established by the Regulations on this basis.    The estimation algorithm for the technical status of the  boilers, the structure of which is designed for the period of  design service life as well as beyond its limit, is the  foundation in the Regulations for carrying out the diagnostic  operations. This structure includes the content and sequence of  the necessary stages of the operations to establish the  possibility and conditions of safe operation.    The content of the stages of the operations to assess the  technical status of boilers is set forth in the corresponding  sections of the Regulations: analysis of the the design features  and of the technology of the manufature and conditions of the  boilers (sec. 4); actual examination of boilers (sec. 5), which  includes the use of a complex of nondestructive monitoring  methods; the investigation of the condition and properties of  the metal (sec. 6), and, finally, check strength calculation and  estimation of residual life (sec. 7).    The norms for the assessment of the technical status on the  basis of the results of the technical diagnosis as applied to  the geometrical dimensions and to the mechanical properties and  defects of the basic metal and of welded, forged, and riveted,  joints, are presented in sec. 8.    The requirements for the formal presentation of the results  of the technical diagnosis and the prognosis of the possibility  and conditions of the further operation of the boilers are set  forth in the concluding sec. 9 of the general part of the  Regulations.    The analysis of the actual status of long-operating boiler  equipment is presented in the Regulations. The boilers are  divided in groups A and B, the first of which represents  equipment with operating periods within the limits of 20 to 40  years, the second of which, longer than 40 years. Critical  standards on the status of the construction elements, the  properties and structure of the metal, and the results of  hydrolic testing. The procedures in case of a deviation from  limiting conditions and designations of the following scopes of  diagnosis and repair, as well as the conditions of further  operation, are regulated.    Practical aspects of the technical diagnosis of various  types  of boilers are also considered in the Regulations; the program  of technical diagnosis of the most common types of boilers of  domestic manufacture, the MZK, E1/9, PKN, PTZM, PTVM, DKV, DKVR,  etc., within the limits of the design period and after its  expiration, are presented. In keeping with the approach adopted  in the main text of the Regulations, potentially dangerous  components of the design of boilers on the drawings are  considered, and the methods and scopes of criterional  evaluations of the technical diagnosis results indicated.  Recommendations are given for the formal presentation of the  results of the diagnosis and the preparation of the conclusions  regarding the possibility, periods, and conditions of the  further operation of boilers.    Overall the Regulations have been devised to provide  assistance to the operating personnel of industrial boiler,  installation, repair, and diagnostic enterprises and  organizations in the ensurance of the reliable and prolonged  operation of boiler equipment on the basis of the effective  solution of the problems of technical diagnosis.

A previous administration had promised 10-year protection to Sahaviriya Steel Industry in 1989. But with demand continuing to outstrip supply, the government has persuaded Sahaviriya to co-operate in allowing more steel factories to be built. The move will almost certainly see two powerful local groups move into steelmaking: Siam Cement, in a joint venture with Mitsui and Nippon Steel of Japan, expects to build a cold-rolled steel plant, and NTS Steel Group has applied to construct a hot-rolled steel centre.

Shokhin, deputy general director of the  Moscow Municipal State Industrial Railroad Transport Enterprise,  chief inspector for Traffic Safety: ""Without Accident or Injury:  Work at the Moscow Promzheldortrans Enterprise""]    [Text] A year ago, on 30 March, GUDOK published an  appeal from the collective of the Moscow State Promzheldortrans  Enterprise to the railroad workers and to all workers, calling  for transport work to be performed in 1993 without wrecks,  accidents or injuries.    The year passed, and it was revealed that  Promzheldortrans did not take the words as just idle talk:  during the past year and the first quarter of this one, it did  not permit a single wreck nor production injury.    How did they succeed in achieving these results? We  asked B. Shokhin, deputy general director of the Moscow  Municipal State Industrial Railroad Transport Enterprise, chief  inspector for Traffic Safety, to tell us.    Our proposal may have seemed adventurous to some people, but  all our production subdivisions took it very seriously and  responsibly. We have been working toward this goal for several  years, realizing that you can't eliminate defects by waving a  magic wand, you need solid organizational and technological  running time. Therefore we first prepared a bridgehead from  which we could assume the offensive.    For example, we were the first on the railroad network to  introduce a system of accident-free work: ""Foresight is a pledge  of safety."" Having become familiar with this, the specialists  most likely would not find any innovations for themselves which  would not be known to our colleagues from other enterprises and  roads. It is my firm conviction that this is not required. One  thing is necessary when working with rolling stock: impeccable  adherence to the rules for technical operation and instructions  and orders, for the slightest deviation from them is fraught  with peril -- and commanders of all ranks must establish rigid  monitoring of the entire technological chain.    At selector conferences, when the question of traffic safety  would come up, we most often heard complaints that the rails  were extremely worn (especially on the enterprise track spurs,  where we have to do our main amount of work), that railcars  needing repair are in operation everywhere, and that  loading-unloading mechanisms often get out of order, and indeed,  are often of an obsolete design. All this is true. For some  reason, though, in discussing the problems of safety,  increasingly fewer people have paid attention to the human  factor. When an accident happens, then as a rule, we find out:  It was not the equipment that let us down, but the person  controlling it.    Therefore, having begun to introduce an accident-free  system,  we waged a most decisive battle against those who violated work  discipline. A drunken person is dangerous at any production  facility, but especially at a transport facility: after all, in  this case, he risks not only his own life, but also the lives of  other people. We must remember what tremendous material damage  an accident on the railroad incurs. It is not by chance that  medical monitoring is compulsory for locomotive crews and  yardmasters before they go on for their shift. We decided among  ourselves at the enterprise to make this more severe: we perform  it not only before a team goes to work, but after the shift. A  foreman who conceals a violation of discipline or lets an  engineer (yardmaster) go to work when he is drunk will be fired  from the enterprise, rather than the violator. Even before, we  were forced to apply these strict sanctions. They proved to be  effective -- we have not encountered drunkenness at the work  place for three years now. We were forced to let go the ones who  could not take themselves in hand, but those who were inclined  to go on drinking bouts, but valued their work at our enterprise  had to combat the unhealthy habit for themselves.    Having got rid of our drunks, we are strictly adhering to  our  rules -- not to accept for work people who have been dismissed  from other enterprises for the same reason. Every quarter, I  personally take to the road administration lists of engineers  who have been deprived of the right to drive locomotives for  some specific reason. We send these lists to all the  subdivisions: not a single violator who has been fired from the  railroad will find any sympathy from our staff members. To this  kind of person we state: Before you take on the control of  equipment, you will learn to control yourself.    In introducing the accident-free work system, we certified  all the workers and regularly conduct recertification. This is a  very serious examination for everyone. Let us say, an engineer  and a yardmaster should have an impeccable knowledge not only of  the rules of technical operation and safety, but of all the  special features of the sections which they handle. We handle,  as you know, the enterprises of the capital. The line within the  city limits has an abundance of curves, grades and upgrades. An  engineer who does shunting work should, of course, as they say,  know with his eyes closed where the downgrade or ascending grade  begins and be particularly attentive at sections with small  radius curves. As should, by the way, yardmasters. An engineer  is categorically forbidden to put a locomotive into motion until  he is certain (visually or by radio) where the yardmaster is at  the given moment.    We have also resorted to a number of additional measures.  Considering the present technical condition of the track and the  rolling stock, we have restricted speeds in order to eliminate  damage. For example, when a locomotive approaches a consist, the  norm-set speed should not exceed 5 kilometers an hour, but we  have restricted it to 1.5 kilometers an hour, and when a consist  is fed under a trestle or when it is removed after loading or  unloading, from 15 to 3 kilometers an hour. With movement along  a curve with a radius of less than 120 meters, we have reduced  it from 15 to 5 kilometers a hour.    One often hears today that, with the transition to new  economic relations, the need for monitoring adherence to  discipline and the rules of safety has disappeared. People  interested in the end result of work, on which their wages  depend, will of themselves, without prodding, perform their  duties conscientiously. They will not tolerate being alongside  those who violate discipline or are sloppy workers. It is  possible that when the market economy, moreover a civilized one,  not the one that we have, becomes firmly established, it will be  this way. For the time being, though, monitoring is necessary.    Incidentally, it exists, and much more strictly than in our  country, in the highly developed capitalist states. We also  attribute paramount importance to monitoring functions. All the  divisions, enterprises and sections have been assigned a command  staff. Nor have we given up holding the ""Safety and Labor Safety  Practice Days."" In preparing for them, we organize surprise  checks, and moreover, on both the day and night shifts. I  emphasize the word, surprise.    It is no secret that we most often have occasion to  encounter  violations on paydays. With the approval of the work  collectives, we issue wages once a month (formerly, as at most  enterprises, we paid them twice a month). On those days we step  up the monitoring at all the subdivisions.    There is one more innovation which we are striving to comply  with without delay. Our production commanders are obliged to  check the working ability of all their subordinates every  one-and-half hours in the course of a work shift. How to get to  the work places, whether to call a subordinate to their offices  by radio or through public safety inspectors -- that is for them  to decide. The main thing is to put in place a covering force to  avert violations of labor safety practices, and thus  sub-standard work or an accident. Incidentally, with a staff of  800 people, over 250 of them are public traffic safety  inspectors.    The introduction of an accident-free work system also made  us  correct the regulations on material incentive. The criteria for  a favorable evaluation of the work of each brigade are the  absence of sub-standard work, injury, outbreak of fire and  damage to rolling stock, and after that, labor productivity and  the profit obtained.    None of what I have said means that the problems of  introducing new equipment, advanced technology and the technical  state of transport developments have, as it were, been pushed  into the background. In this respect we have been lucky, since  the leading transport institutes are located in Moscow, and we  have the opportunity of being the first to test their scientific  developments and put them into operation.    In conclusion, I wish to say that the accident-free work  system that we introduced will prove itself as effective only  when the entire set of measures is applied, from organizational  to technological. The experience that we have accumulated shows  that, even in the present difficult economic situation, one can  work without accidents and injuries, or at least reduce them to  a minimum. We have called upon and still call upon all railroad  workers to do this.     "

Other commenters stated that field measurements for projects in this sector were particularly essential to assure the accuracy of the data submitted. Consistent with the flexibility necessary to encourage reporting in this and all other sectors, the guidelines do not provide prescriptive features such as requiring field measurements. Rather, the guidelines indicate that a reporter will be asked to categorize the data submitted, including whether it is based on measurement.        6. Agricultural        Comments received on the draft document for the Agricultural Sector were indicative of the complexity of the sector, and its unique characteristic of including reportable activities that contribute both to greenhouse gas emissions and to carbon sequestration.

Last year, there were fund shortages and the center put into  effect a series of macroeconomic control policies and measures.  In such a general environment, our province, motivated by  Comrade Xiaoping's southern inspection remarks and the spirit of  the 14th CPC Congress, conscientiously implemented the  Provisions, making focused efforts to transform mechanisms and  to resolutely adjust the product mix; as a result the industrial  economy continued its good momentum of rapid and healthy  development: For the year, the total value of output of  industrial enterprises at the township level or above  provincewide was 56.963 billion yuan, and the sales value of  industrial output was 54.419 billion yuan; both figures  represented substantial increases over the previous year. The  rate of industrial products sold reached 95.7 percent, an  increase of 1.2 percentage points over the previous year.    There were five gratifying changes in our province's rapidly  developing economy:    --The growth momentum of heavy industry was strong. Last  year the value of output of heavy industry enterprises  provincewide increased by 20.3 percent over the previous year,  representing a growth rate which was 4.6 percentage points  higher than the province's industrial growth rate; heavy  industry' share of the province's total value of industrial  output increased from 60.5 percent in the year before last to  62.9 percent last year, and the increase in heavy industry's  value of output accounted for 78.5 percent of the increase in  the province's total value of industrial output.    --The nonstate industrial sector grew faster than the state  industrial sector. Last year, the total value of output and  sales revenues of collective enterprises in the nonstate  industrial sector of the province increased by 31.5 percent and  39.1 percent respectively over the previous year. In this  respect the total value of output and sales revenues of  township-run industrial enterprises increased by 46.8 percent  and 55.3 percent respectively; the total value of output and  sales revenues of the rest of the nonstate industrial sector  increased by 81.9 percent and 97.5 percent respectively. For the  same period the total value of output and sales revenues of  state-owned industrial enterprises increased by only 10.9  percent and 11.9 percent respectively.    --The amount of foreign exchange created by industrial  exports increased rather rapidly. Last year the value of  industrial exports delivered by the province increased by 27.9  percent over the previous year. In this regard the growth rate  for the first half of the year was 16.3 percentage points higher  than that for the second half.    --Sales revenues of industrial enterprises covered by the  budget on the one hand and profits made by those enterprises and  taxes paid by those enterprises on the other hand increased in a  synchronized manner. Last year, sales revenues of the  province's industrial enterprises covered by the budget  increased by 30.1 percent, while profits made by those  enterprises and taxes paid by those enterprises increased by  27.5 percent.    --Industrial production and sales of the prefectures and  cities increased on a widespread basis. Last year, except  for Tongchuan City, the industrial economy of each of 10  prefectures and cities in the province increased over the  previous year; the growth rate of industrial sales revenues of  each of seven prefectures and cities was higher than the  provincial average.

Shearing - or cutting up - will probably go ahead within the next month. The first fuel rods for reprocessing at Thorp arrived in 1988 and have since been stored in ponds to allow short-lived highly radioactive isotopes to decay. Some of the fuel has already been moved to the 'head-end plant' where it will be sheared into smaller pieces and dropped down a chute to a basket suspended in nitric acid. Dissolved fuel is transferred to the chemical separation plant where the uranium and plutonium are parted from the waste. The uranium and plutonium are then separated from each other, and converted to solid form for storage and eventual re-use.   Companies:-  British Nuclear Fuels.

When was the last time anyone engraved an interest rate in stone? Howe's observant eye had spotted a block of apartments near London's Camberwell Road called 'The Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Association'. He could not miss it, he said, because the rate was engraved on the face of the building - erected less than 90 years ago. The 4 per cent was meant to impress investors seeking high yields - rather than borrowers looking for cheap mortgages. But Howe did not sound at all optimistic about the future employment prospects for stonemasons. Surely the Bank of England could do with a bit of fettling up in the interim?

At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32.08 at 3,862.70, its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard  Poor's 500 ended up 2.54 at 466.44, while the American Stock Exchange finished up 1.20 at 465.98. The Nasdaq composite fared less well, and closed only 0.11 higher at 789.20. Trading volume was 303m shares. After Thursday's frenetic trading in bonds and stocks, much of it prompted by unsubstantiated rumours concerning the White House and the Whitewater affair, some semblance of calm returned to financial markets yesterday. Share prices, however, opened lower after an early rally in the bond market had fizzled out. That rally in bonds had been inspired by a February retail sales report. Although the figures showed a bigger than expected increase of 1.5 per cent in February sales, bond market investors and traders chose to concentrate instead on a surprise, and sharp, downward revision in the January data. If the two months were taken together, analysts said, sales were essentially flat in early 1994, which was good news for inflation-sensitive bonds. Yet the bond market could not hold on to its early gains, which disturbed equity investors. Consequently, stocks fell across the board in the first hour of trading. However, the market later rallied convincingly off its lows, and again it was bond prices which provided the lead. Bonds, having fallen to opening values mid-morning, revived later, and by late afternoon the benchmark 30-year government bond was up three quarters of a point, and the yield was down to 6.909 per cent. The rally inspired the stock market, and aided by short-covering, blue-chip stocks steadily recovered during a busy afternoon of buying. Among individual issues, Grumman jumped Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in volume of 2m shares after a second rival defence group, Northrop, offered to buy the company. Northrop's offer of Dollars 60 a share tops an earlier, agreed, bid from Martin Marrietta worth Dollars 55 a share. The rise in Grumman's stock yesterday implies that the market expects the bidding war to escalate well beyond Dollars 60 a share. The news left Northrop up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 41 3/8 and Martin Marrietta off Dollars 2 at Dollars 44 1/2 . Unisys climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 15 3/4 , lifted by news of a Dollars 127m banking automation contract awarded to the company and a ratings upgrade from brokerage house Lehman Brothers. International Paper, hit earlier in the week by a profits warning, rebounded Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 after Paine Webber upgraded its rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'buy'. Canada Toronto shares ended little changed in active trading. The composite index was up 3.68 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 4446.86, for a gain on the week of about 48 points. In Friday's trading, declines led advances by 376 to 371, volume of 94.959 shares was below Thursday's 100.444 shares, and trading value fell to CDollars 823m from CDollars 917.5m. Most gains were limited. Industrial products gained 0.61 per cent, consumer products and energy were flat, and mining, financial services, and golds were down slightly.

0,FT944-15440 ,"FT944-15440 _AN-EJRCWAGBFT 941018   FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (5): Is there a spy in your boardroom? - Industrial espionage is a growing problem in business      By PETER MARSH   Is there a turner in the boardroom? This question, being increasingly asked by big and small companies around the world, has nothing to do with art collections but is concerned with the growing problem of industrial espionage. Industrial espionage can be defined as virtually any technique aimed at taking a company's secrets. Although electronic surveillance or computer hacking more often grab the headlines, the most common form of industrial espionage is for a rival company to employ an insider - or a turner in the trade jargon - to give them inside information. Industrial espionage is increasingly worrying executives in highly competitive areas of industry. High-tech businesses such as aerospace, engineering, computers and telecommunications are frequent victims but companies in other fields, where marketing or advertising strategies may be as important as new product information, are also suffering. Behind the phenomenon is the large financial advantage that a rival company may gain from a timely insight into a competitor's product ideas or marketing plans. 'Why should a company spend Pounds 100m on research and development when it can gain the relevant knowledge from a rival for a much smaller outlay?' asks Peter Heims, a British security consultant. According to Paul Carratu, managing director of Carratu International, a London-based fraud investigator, the most common form of industrial espionage concerns disaffected employees offering this type of information to a rival for a fee. 'More often than not you see the opportunist approach where the employee makes the information available via an intermediary such as a security company. It is less common to see the more direct approach where a rival goes out actively to seek the information through bugging or similar means,' says Mr Carratu. It follows, therefore, that the most sensible ways to try to stop industrial espionage are through common sense tactics that are really nothing more than an extension of good management. Among these are restricting access to sensitive product or marketing information; keeping a check on documents that could be of value to a rival; and trying to sort out personal problems involving employees before the person affected becomes so disgruntled that he or she even thinks of starting to hawk secrets to competitors. Of course, deciding on where to draw the line on potentially sensitive information may be highly tricky. There is a story much recounted among industrial espionage investigators of a company that, in the cause of improving communications with its employees, revealed detailed marketing information about a new product launch in its internal company newspaper several weeks before the product appeared. Not surprisingly, the details leaked out to a competitor and the company launched an industrial espionage probe which ultimately led to the dismissal of the newspaper's unfortunate editor. The point underlines the fact that industrial espionage covers a wide spectrum. One estimate of the extent of industrial espionage is that about half of all big companies may have had secret information leaked over the past decade by some form of espionage. The phenomenon is relatively widespread in the US, France and Italy, according to Mr Carratu. 'There is less industrial espionage in Britain: in the UK it's thought not to be ethical to indulge in this kind of thing,' he says. Understandably enough, most companies hit byindustrial espionage do not like to talk about it. But in recent years the businesses affected have included BP and Shell, which suffered as a result of outsiders gaining access to secret tender information for engineering contracts through the information leaking out via an unscrupulous marketing agent. Volkswagen and General Motors have recently been locked in a long-running battle over allegations by the US company that its rival 'stole' secrets - allegedly channelled to the German car maker by the defection to Volkswagen of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a Spaniard who had been running GM's worldwide parts purchasing operations. SKF, the Swedish ball-bearing company, also recently suffered an embarrassing loss of its new product plans which was later traced to a disgruntled employee. Electronic surveillance is a method frequently used by competitors to gain access to secrets. A rival boardroom can be bugged - perhaps using the services of a person contracted for this purpose who uses the 'cover' of working for a cleaning company - with an instrument the size of a matchbox and costs no more than Pounds 100. Such devices, with tiny microphones and which transmit over perhaps a quarter of a mile, can be very difficult to spot if cleverly hidden.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

This has disrupted the normal order of the compact disk  industry and infringed upon the interests of copyright holders.    Through investigation, this reporter has discovered that in  1992 China had only one CD production factory, the Xianke  Corporation in Shenzhen. Later, there were three factories and  three production lines. By the end of 1993, however, the  figures jumped to 25 factories and 30 production lines.    What impact do 30 production lines have on the CD market? In  1992 the total annual CD sales in China were around 3 million,  but a Xianke CD production line in Shenzhen alone had an annual  production capacity of 5 million CDs. We can thus see that even  if the domestic CD sales market grows several fold, a few CD  production factories can sufficiently saturate the market.    What is terrible, however, is that in less than 18 months 10  times as many production lines have emerged, with a full-load  production capacity of nearly 100 million CDs. Moreover, new CD  production lines are still being imported.    In March 1993 the State Planning Commission and the  department concerned studied the issue of importing CD  production lines. Taking into consideration the domestic market  demands at that time, the commission explicitly stipulated that  before the country's overall development plan for CD players and  laser disk players is promulgated, no department or locality may  approve the construction of new factories and the expansion of  existing production capacity. After the planning commission  document was transmitted to the lower levels, some localities  and departments, in total disregard of the document provisions,  blindly approved the construction of CD production factories,  with the result that CD output far outstripped domestic market  demands. What was especially serious was that some unscrupulous  overseas businessmen have taken advantage of the opportunity to  make an inroad and engage in large-scale pirating activities.  This has not only disrupted the domestic video market, but also  the international disk market. The Shanghai office of the  International Disk Industrial Association recently officially  brought a suit in the Shanghai Municipal Intermediate People's  Court against a certain Taiwan businessman called Hsu for  carrying out illegal pirating activities on the mainland. Hsu  was tracked down by the Taiwan authorities for carrying out  illegal disk pirating activities in Taiwan. Pending trial, Hsu  entered China in early 1993 and engaged in illegal CD copying  activities. While serving as deputy general manager of business  at Baodie Laser and Electronics Company Limited, a Sino-foreign  joint venture in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, he provided the  company with the masters of programs produced by the  International Disk Industrial Association, which has the right  over the programs, and copied 121,000 CDs in 35 varieties. He  also accepted a processing task for Huadie Guangdian Company  Limited, a Sino-foreign joint venture in Hangzhou, and produced  18,000 CDs in 14 varieties. Most of the copied and pirated CDs  have entered the international market.    At present, the issue of illegally importing CD production  lines has drawn the close attention of the relevant government  department. The department deems it necessary to immediately  stop importing CD production lines from abroad and exercise  strict and necessary standardized management over CD factories  currently in production and operation. Otherwise, the factories  will face the risk of bankruptcy and it will be impossible to  curb piracy in some domestic markets.     "

0,FT923-7552 ,"FT923-7552 _AN-CHSA3ADCFT 920817   FT  17 AUG 92 / British unions consulted less than on Continent      By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor and MICHAEL SMITH   BRITISH unions and employees have been consulted far less about moves towards decentralisation and greater flexibility in industrial relations than their continental European counterparts, according to a study to be published next month. While most European governments have been promoting labour-market flexibility, the normal pattern outside Britain has been for such changes to be implemented in close consultation between unions and management, say Prof Richard Hyman and Mr Anthony Ferner of Warwick University. Analyses of trends in individual countries conclude that: 'Thatcherism' in Britain generally reinforced trends in industrial relations that were already under way rather than marking a change of course, and has not left British managers with a more strategic approach to industrial relations. In France, in spite of support for collective bargaining and stronger industrial relations institutions, unions have continued their long decline and employers are enjoying a resurgence in public esteem as wealth creators. The German dual system of industry bargaining and company-level works councils has proved remarkably adaptable but is responding more uncertainly to the challenges of reunification and the introduction of Japanese-style production concepts. Industrial relations in Italy have undergone the most remarkable transformation over the last decade, with co-operation in change encouraged by increasingly formal union-management arrangements. The study challenges the thesis that union power is withering away. It concludes: 'In most countries unions are still robust and are important agents of industrial relations change, especially where national unions maintain strong links with workplace organisation.'

The first describes sympathetically many of the arguments deployed in opposition to Nafta, which joined the US, Mexico and Canada in a free trade area which came into effect at the start of this year envisaging the elimination of all trade barriers between the three countries over a 15-year period. The second is the latest of the country reviews of industrial development produced by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation and published by the EIU which examines the ability of Mexico to compete in its new North American environment. For Richer, For Poorer typifies much of the muddled debate over Nafta. Its underlying premise is that the agreement is essentially a charter allowing large corporations to exploit cheap Mexican labour and lax environmental regulation and to keep down US wages. The implicit suggestion that Nafta ignores the needs of dynamic small and medium-sized businesses on both sides of the border is an interesting one that deserves further examination, but that's not what we are treated to. Instead, a work full of contradictions suggests that Mexico's Dollars 280bn economy will inflict huge economic damage on the Dollars 6,000bn US economy and on American workers. What's more, as far as one can gather, it will do so without producing any appreciable benefit to the Mexican economy or the people who work in it. The premise is that Nafta will encourage US companies to move to Mexico, but that Mexican workers will not benefit because Nafta 'contained no mechanisms that would allow them to resist their government's repressive, low-wage strategy'. This refers to the government's domination of the Mexican trade unions which benefits corporations at the expense of workers. Evidence that Mexican workers will not benefit from Nafta is the 20-40 per cent fall in real wages they suffered between 1982 and 1991 - a peak-to-trough comparison incorporating the years of the debt crisis. Meanwhile, US workers will suffer even as labour productivity increases. This is because the theory of comparative advantage - that overall welfare increases when countries make the things they produce most efficiently and trade them freely - does not work in the real-world absence of its perfect market assumptions. The evidence for this also comes from the 1980s where real manufacturing wages declined 5-10 per cent. 'Although the number of jobs in the economy increased by over 20m during the decade and the unemployment rate fell, workers' incomes barely improved,' it says, as if the creation of 20m jobs benefits nobody. The inconsistencies are manifold and evidence used to illustrate one point is contradicted to make another. For example, while it argues that Mexicans won't benefit from the low wages to be paid by US companies, it makes the point elsewhere that it is not only low-paid, low-skill jobs that will migrate to Mexico. The initial flavour of academic impartiality is quickly cast aside. Nafta, though it came into effect but months ago, is somehow connected to the terrible performance of Mexican agriculture which has turned the country from being a net exporter of agricultural products into a net importer. The drawbacks of the maquila system of in-bond manufacturing in place since 1965 - US companies establish manufacturing plants in Mexico and can import their inputs duty-free providing they export the manufactured result - are insinuated to be the same drawbacks of Nafta. The spillover benefits of the maquiladora industry to the Mexican economy have been limited, it is true. But under Nafta, the maquiladoras - which earned an estimated Dollars 5bn in foreign exchange in 1993 - will be phased out. As the UNIDO report points out, Nafta will remove the obstacles to the maquiladoras' use of Mexican inputs and should help their integration into the Mexican economy. The UNIDO publication is both duller and better researched. It argues electronic, food processing, motor vehicle, petrochemical and textile industries in Mexico all stand to benefit from Nafta. Among maquilas, those using Japanese and other foreign components will benefit least. Overall, it estimates Nafta will lead to the creation of 600,000 new jobs in Mexico by 1995 - and an increase in wage rates.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

NIOSH is proposing a limited revision to the existing requirements of 30 CFR part 11 in this first ``module'', requiring updated particulate filter tests. These proposed changes would produce significant improvements in the level of protection provided to the wearers of the respiratory protective devices and would enable users to easily discern the level of protection that can be expected when using a particular respirator, with little impact on the certification process. NIOSH estimates that these changes to the particulate filter requirements will affect approximately 80% of all respirators currently marketed.   These new filter requirements would update the existing 30 CFR part 11 provisions to provide a particulate efficiency determination and classification system consistent with advances in respiratory protection technology. The tests to determine the respirator filter's particulate efficiency enable classification of the filters on their ability to inhibit the penetration of particulates of the most penetrating size. The effectiveness of a device to remove particulates from the ambient air would be reflected in a three-tiered classification system based on the filter's demonstrated efficiency. Classification of the filters in this manner eliminates the need to test and classify the filter respirator according to composition of contaminant (e.g., ``dust, fume, and mist'', ``asbestos''), since the penetration rate for particulates in the atmosphere, regardless of composition, will not exceed that of the test particulate. To revise respirator nomenclature to be consistent with this fundamental change in certification philosophy, the words ``dust, fume and mist'' have been changed to ``particulate'' in the proposed rule.   NIOSH has long been concerned with the health risks to workers due to the inappropriate selection and use of dust/mist and dust/fume/mist respirators. Assigned Protection Factor (APF) values are used in the respirator selection process to indicate the expected protection level. NIOSH has considered the possibility of reducing the Assigned Protection Factor (APF) values given in the NIOSH Guide to Industrial Respiratory Protection and in the Respirator Decision Logic for dust and fume respirators to account for filter penetration that can occur, theoretically, when these respirators are inappropriately used against aerosols less than 2 micrometers in diameter. On September 15, 1992, NIOSH prepared a draft report, ``A Performance Evaluation of DM and DFM Filter Respirators Certified for Protection Against Toxic Dusts, Fumes, and Mist,'' explaining its concerns and suggested course of action. NIOSH solicited an external scientific peer review of this draft report on September 15, 1992. This review did not support an immediate revision of the APF values. The reviewers recommended that NIOSH address the concern about excessive filter penetration by incorporating improved filter-penetration tests into the respirator certification regulation.   After careful consideration of this issue, NIOSH agrees with the scientific reviewers that, during the transition period for the implementation of the provisions contained in this rule, an adjustment of APF values is unnecessary and may confuse respirator users. NIOSH will continue to recommend the APF values contained in the NIOSH Guide to Industrial Respiratory Protection (September 1987) and in the Respirator Decision Logic (May 1987) for respirators previously certified under the provisions of 30 CFR part 11. For respirators certified for protection against particulate exposures under the new part 84 which would replace the existing Dust/Mist and Dust/Fume/Mist filter respirators under 30 CFR part 11, NIOSH will be recommending new APF values that account for the new nomenclature and test criteria. These new values, updating the recommendations cited above, will be published in a Respirator User's Notice accompanying publication of this rule as final. It is anticipated that the module on Assigned Protection Factors will be proposed in late 1994, at which time public comment will be solicited.

To implement the  guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the decision  of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  and based on the current conditions and trend of our country's  economic development, the ""Outline of State Industrial Policy in  the Nineties"" is herein formulated as a guide and basis for  making various industrial policies in the future.    The following principles must be observed in formulating the  state industrial policy. 1) The industrial policy must conform  to objective laws of the industrialization and modernization  process and must be in close touch with China's national  conditions and the characteristics of the changes of its  industrial structure; 2) It must accord with the requirement of  establishing a socialist market economic structure and bring  into full play the fundamental role of the market in resource  allocation under the state's macroeconomic regulation and  control; 3) It must give prominence to what is important and  concentrate efforts on resolving major issues affecting the  entire national economy; 4) It must be operable and must  primarily use economic, legal, and necessary administrative  measures to guarantee its implementation, and it must support  the development of industries and products in short supply and  restrain the development of industries and products in excessive  supply.    The major tasks to be tackled by the state's industrial  policy in the nineties are: to continue strengthening the role  of agriculture as the foundation and develop the rural economy  in an all-around way; vigorously strengthen basic industries and  strive to ameliorate the situation in which infrastructures and  basic industries lag behind to a serious degree; step up the  development of pillar industries to promote all-around  revitalization of the national economy; rationally adjust  foreign economic and trade structures to enhance the  international competitiveness of our industries; accelerate the  pace of developing high- and new-technology industries and  support the development of new industries and products; and  continue the vigorous efforts to develop tertiary industries.  At the same time, it should optimize the industrial  organization and structure, raise industries' technological  level, and make the industrial distribution more rational.    I. Vigorously Develop Agriculture and the Rural Economy and  Increase Peasants' Income    Vigorously developing agriculture and the rural economy and  increasing peasants' income are the primary task of our  country's economic development in the nineties. We must firmly  cultivate an awareness of farming as understood in the broader  sense to develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,  sideline production, and fishery in an all-around way;  vigorously develop the type of farming that provides high yields  of fine quality with maximum efficiency capable of earning  foreign exchanges; and bring the volume, variety, and quality of  farm produce to a level that will meet the demands of a nation  with a relatively comfortable standard of living and the demands  of the international market. We must rationally adjust the  rural industrial structure, actively develop secondary and  tertiary industries in the countryside, gradually shift the  surplus labor force in rural areas, and raise the overall rural  production capacity and economic efficiency to a new level.    In developing agriculture and the rural economy, it is  essential to seriously implement the policies and measures which  have already been laid down by the party Central Committee and  the State Council, and to carry out the ""agricultural  development program of China for the nineties."" It is necessary  to extend the term for contracting cultivated land; and to  stabilize and further improve the household contract  responsibility system with remuneration linked to output as the  main form, as well as the dual management system which combines  household with collective operations. It is necessary to  rationally restructure agricultural production organizations and  to promote new forms of production organization, such as  integration of crop cultivation, aquaculture and processing, and  integrated management of agriculture, trade and industry. It is  necessary to cultivate the rural market and to establish sound  systems of protective grain prices, of grain risk funds, and of  grain reserves. It is necessary to establish and keep improving  a socialized service system for agriculture and to form a  three-tier service network of the state, the collective, and the  local people. It is necessary to seriously protect cultivated  land, gradually establish basic farmland reservations, and  formulate relevant procedures for their management. Both the  central and the local governments should increase agricultural  investment year by year and support the industry for  agricultural production. At the same time, the peasants should  be guided to increase investment in production and encouraged to  use foreign capital in agricultural development. It is  necessary to actively use and popularize new, suitable  agricultural techniques and to advance agriculture through the  application of science and promotion of education. It is  necessary to reduce peasants' burdens and protect their  interests and legitimate rights.    While agricultural productivity is being raised, making a  rational relocation of the rural surplus labor force is an  important measure for promoting agriculture and rural economic  development and increasing peasants' income. A further step  should be taken to accelerate the development of village and  town enterprises, particularly those in the central and western  regions. It is necessary to improve planning and provide policy  guidance to bring about proper concentration of village and town  enterprises. It is necessary to make full use of and transform  existing small towns, and to build new small towns.    It is necessary to implement seriously the plan set by the  party Central Committee and the State Council for aiding the  poor, and to basically solve the problem of food and clothing  for 80 million people in poor regions within seven years.    II. Conscientiously Strengthen Infrastructure and Basic  Industries    While our infrastructure and basic industries are lagging  far  behind our economic development as a whole, efforts should be  made to resolve such a contradiction and to gradually make the  former catch up and keep pace with the latter. It is necessary  to adhere to the principle of ""making overall plans and a  rational geographic distribution, giving prominence to what is  important, doing our best according to our capability, and  stressing economic efficiency"" to accelerate infrastructural  construction and the development of basic industries.    In the transport industry, a higher priority should be given  to enhancing the transport capability of railroads and efforts  should be focused on the development of large transport  passages. It is necessary to take full advantage of various  conveyances, including highways, water transport, air transport,  and pipes, and to accelerate the construction of a comprehensive  transport system. The telecommunications industry should aim for  high speed, good quality, and a large scale; actively introduce  advanced world-class technology and equipment; strive to  increase the proportion of equipment produced by our own country  as soon as possible; and vigorously promote the phased-in  construction of high-speed information networks covering  selected regions. Energy industries should pursue the policy of  stressing both exploitation and conservation and ensure a  coordinated development of energy sources, the economy, and the  environment. Of them, the coal industry should accelerate the  construction of key state-owned coal mines and promote the  transformation and improvement of local mines, including  township and town mines. The petroleum industry should  stabilize the eastern region, develop the western region, find  more petroleum deposits, and make rational use of foreign  resources. The electric power industry should adhere to the  principle of considering local conditions, developing both  hydro-electric and thermo-electric power generation, and  properly developing nuclear power generation. It is necessary  to strengthen and improve existing water conservancy facilities,  make comprehensive efforts to harness selected major rivers and  lakes, prevent soil erosion, protect and rationally allocate  water resources, enhance the ability to combat floods and  droughts, and gradually solve the water supply problem of  regions and urban areas with water shortages. It is necessary  to accelerate the development of urban public utilities in  accordance with the principle of ""unified planning, rational  distribution, comprehensive development, and coordinated  construction.""    To accelerate the infrastructural construction and the  development of basic industries, the state will mainly adopt the  following policies: to give full play to both central  initiative and local initiative and establish a system under  which the duties of the governments at various levels are  clearly defined; to formulate specific plans for infrastructure  and basic industries and promote their healthy development; to  institute and keep improving a policy-oriented long-term  investment system and a long-term policy-lending system and  provide policy-oriented financial support to  government-encouraged construction projects; to encourage and  guide the use of private funds in the construction of  infrastructure and basic industries, and consider first the need  of infrastructural construction and the development of basic  industries when issuing shares and bonds; to expand the scale  and area of using foreign capital and encourage foreign  businessmen to make direct investment in infrastructure and  basic industries; to further harmonize the relations of prices,  give play to the important regulatory role of the pricing  mechanism, and continue and strengthen government control of the  prices of monopolized goods and services; to continue the policy  of low-priced land requisition for infrastructure and basic  industries; to spend government income from the sale of land  resources on the construction of infrastructure; and with  approval, to let investors of transport facilities enjoy higher  priority in obtaining the right to engage in real estate  development and business along communications lines and in the  vicinity of harbors and airports, as a comprehensive economic  compensation.    III. Take Active Efforts To Invigorate Pillar  Industries    We should strive to accelerate the development of the  electronic, machinery, petrochemical, automobile, and  construction industries and turn them into pillar industries for  the national economy.    The development of the machinery industry should focus on  the  manufacturing of basic machine-tools, basic spare parts, and  whole-set equipment which requires key technologies in an effort  to optimize product mix, improve its technical standard, and  enhance its market competition. The electronic industry should  speed up its modernization on the basis of manufacturing  microelectronic components and telecommunications equipment,  computers, and other newly emerging information products as the  mainstay. The petrochemical industry should make active efforts  to expand its production and enhance its technical level and  processing ability. The automobile industry should act as  quickly as possible to form a production system with fewer  plants but high production, and to establish a market where  competition is orderly, and it should increase its share of the  domestic market and competitiveness on the international market.  The construction industry should focus on housing projects in  urban and rural areas, the state's key projects, and urban  construction. It should actively build a unified, open,  competitive, and orderly market and improve the quality of  construction products.    To accelerate the development of pillar industries, the  state  will adopt the following measures: The state will formulate and  promulgate a unified industrial policy and guarantee its  implementation by legal means. The state will gradually  establish an investment and lending system which is beneficial  to the development of pillar industries. The state will also  set up a standardized mechanism enabling enterprises to have  direct access to loans. In its annual plan for issuing stocks  and bonds, the state will make priority arrangements for pillar  industries. The government will support pillar industries in  developing technologies in some important fields by providing  financial and material assistance. With the approval of the  State Council, a small number of large-scale enterprising groups  will be endorsed with a right to directly borrow and underwrite  overseas loans commensurate with their capital and income. In  accordance with international practices and articles of relevant  agreements, some products of pillar industries will be treated  as products of infant industry and given suitable protection for  a set period of time. Meanwhile, part of the domestic market  will be conditionally opened to foreign products in exchange for  key technologies and equipment.    IV. Active Efforts Should Be Taken To Develop Foreign  Economic Ties and Trade    We should continue to expand our foreign trade, actively  readjust the trade structure, bring our advantages into play,  and greatly enhance the economic performance of our exports to  facilitate and optimize the industrial structure, strengthen  international competition, and maintain the international  balance of payments.    The state encourages increasing exports of the following  products: farm and sideline products with fairly good advantages  for competition in foreign markets, products of light industry  and the textile industry, household electronic and electrical  appliances manufactured with almost matured technologies,  products with high added value and with the ability to compete  on the international markets, and high-tech products. The state  does not encourage exports in bulk of resource-type products  which are in short supply domestically. The state will  gradually reduce exports of primary products and products which  require a large amount of energy to produce. Exports of some  products will be limited or prohibited.    The state encourages importing new technologies as well as  relevant key equipments and key spare parts. It will suitably  increase imports of some primary products which are in short  supply domestically. It will assist infant industries to  accelerate the pace of importing, assimilating, and absorbing  new technologies as well as producing new equipments and key  spare parts. The state does not encourage imports of high-price  consumption products.    As far as readjusting the structure of foreign economic ties  and trade is concerned, the state will adopt the following  measures: It will bring into play the important role of the  Import and Export Bank of China and assist enterprises to  increase their export of whole-set equipment as well as  machine-tools and electrical equipment. For some products under  quantitative import or export controls, a system of bidding,  auction, and regulated distribution will be used in accordance  with the principle of economic effectiveness, fairness, and  openness. It will improve the policy which aims to promote  export of intensively processed products and high value-added  products. The state will endorse various qualified enterprises  with a right to engage in foreign trade and encourage  large-scale enterprises (groups) to set up direct sale channels  in foreign countries. The state will rationally readjust tariff  rates in accordance with its industrial policy.    V. Industrial Organization, Industrial Technology,  and Industrial Distribution    1. The policy governing industrial organizations aims at  promoting rational competition among enterprises and establising  economies of scale and cooperation between specialized  departments so that an industrial organizational structure in  line with the technological and economic characteristics of  industry and China's economic development stages can be formed.  A market structure with a small number of large enterprises  (groups) acting as the main competitors shall be formed in  industries which have pronounced effects on the development of  economies of scale; a market structure of an appropriate size  characterized by rational division of work and cooperation among  large, medium-sized, and small enterprises shall be formed in  industries which produce large quantities of spare parts and  components; and in industries where results of the development  of economies of scale are not pronounced, the development of  small enterprises should be encouraged so that a  competition-based market structure can be formed where a rather  large number of large, medium-sized, and small enterprises  coexist.    To attain the above objective, it is necessary to take the  following readjustment measures: To progressively introduce  market mechanisms and encourage rational competition among  naturally monopolistic regional industries; and to continuously  draw up standards governing the minimum production scale for  industrial enterprises and products which have pronounced  effects on the development of economies of scale. At the same  time, it is essential to break the barriers between different  regions or departments and restrict or even prohibit the  development of projects falling short of the standards set for  economies of scale so as to promote the establishment of  economies of scale. To encourage enterprises to act  independently in reorganizing themselves or forming themselves  into public- and private-owned transregional, transdepartmental,  and even transnational business conglomerates, doing so through  fair competition, merger, takeover, and holding each other's  stocks. We should accelerate the formulation of laws and  regulations governing market competition to create an external  environment favorable to fair competition among enterprises and  readjustment of enterprise organizational structure.    2. The industrial technology policy should give priority to  promoting development of applied technology, encouraging the  integration of scientific research and production, accelerating  the popularization of scientific and technological achievements,  promoting the introduction and assimilation of advanced foreign  technology, markedly improving our products' quality and  technical functions, significantly reducing energy and material  consumption as well as production cost, and striving to upgrade  the technology of Chinese industry.    The state will take the following measures to promote  technological advancement in industry: To increase all kinds of  investment in scientific and technological research and  development through various channels and gradually increase the  proportion of investment in the gross national product; to draw  up and implement technological research and development programs  significant for the development of different industries so as to  support and encourage them to assimilate and absorb advanced  imported technology and to make innovations; to strengthen  planning for high- and new-technology industries and do a good  job in building high- and new-technology development zones  approved by the state; to push forward the process of  standardization and serialization and promote the use of  international standards, advanced foreign standards, and even  stricter in-house standards for enterprises; to enhance  enterprises' ability to independently develop new products,  encourage enterprises to strengthen ties with institutes of  higher learning and scientific research, and speed up the  commercialization of scientific and technological achievements;  and to regularly publish, in the form of laws and regulations,  backward production technology and equipment that must be phased  out.    3. The main principle for the policy governing industrial  distribution is: While continuing to give play to the economic  strengths of relatively developed regions and accelerate their  development, it is necessary to aid economic development in less  developed regions and gradually narrow the gap between  economically developed regions and less developed regions. The  state supports the development of industrial belts which give  play to their natural resources and economic strengths and in  which specialized departments in various regions divide their  work and cooperate.    To gradually set up a rational pattern of industrial  distribution along the coasts, rivers, railroads, and frontiers,  large cities located along main lines of communications should  act as centers to bring along the development of major economic  regions. To achieve sustained, rapid, economic growth and better  efficiency, the eastern coastal region should utilize more  foreign capital and resources in vigorously developing an  export-oriented economy, especially technology-intensive  industries and products which have high added-value and foreign  exchange earning capability and which can economize on the  consumption of energy and raw and semifinished materials. The  central and western regions should harness their resources and  utilize the border regions' geographic proximity of opening to  the outside world in striving to develop industries and products  capitalizing on such advantages. The state will gradually shift  preferential economic policies in investments, loans, project  distribution, and foreign capital use from regions to  industries, and will give necessary assistance to major projects  for development and construction of the central and western  regions. The state will support the central and western regions  in developing village and township enterprises, and will  encourage economically developed regions to engage in joint  development, technological cooperation, regular cooperation in  related departments, and personnel exchange with the central and  western regions.    We should make the best use of circumstances to guide the  healthy development of urbanization, setting up an urban  construction system with harmoniously structured and rationally  distributed large, medium, and small cities.    VI. The Procedures for Formulating Industrial Policies and  Their Implementation    Industrial policy is made up of policies on industrial  structure, policies on industrial organization, policies on  industrial technology, policies on industrial distribution, and  other policies and regulations having an important bearing on  industrial development. To ensure the industrial policy's  scientific nature and authority as well as its effectiveness,  the following provisions on the formulation and implementation  of industrial policies are especially made:    1. State industrial policy must be decided by the State  Council. The State Planning Commission is the comprehensive  department specifically in charge of studying, formulating, and  coordinating state industrial policy. The State Planning  Commission will take the lead and coordinate with the relevant  departments in formulating various industrial policies.  Industrial policy will be implemented mainly by relevant  leading departments of their trades at the central level, with  the State Planning Commission making overall coordination.    2. A system for deliberating state industrial policy must be  established. Industrial policy and policies having an important  bearing on industrial development, which are drafted by the  relevant departments, must be examined and coordinated by the  State Planning Commission. They must go through scientific  assessment and democratic deliberation organized by the State  Planning Commission and participated in by the State Council's  relevant departments, industrial and academic circles, and  consumer organizations before they are submitted by the State  Planning Commission together with the relevant departments to  the State Council for approval, promulgation, and implementation.    3. A system for guaranteeing the implementation of the state  industrial policy must be established. Planning, finance,  banking, tax, domestic and foreign trade, tariff, security  market supervision, industry and commerce administration, state  asset management, and other economic management departments must  earnestly implement state industrial policy and must coordinate  with the State Planning Commission before formulating a major  policy concerning industrial development.    4. A system for supervising, inspecting, and evaluating  state industrial policy must be established. The State Planning  Commission together with the relevant departments are  responsible for supervising, inspecting, and analyzing the  implementation of industrial policy; for making periodical  reports to the State Council on the progress and results in the  implementation; and for making suggestions for improvement based  on changes in the economic situation and industrial structure.    5. Local people's governments at the provincial level must,  on the basis of this outline's requirements and in the light of  the realities in each locality, study and formulate specific  rules for implementation and report them to the State Planning  Commission for the record.    6. Based on this outline's requirements, the state will in  the near future formulate a draft industrial policy governing  the transportation, communication, construction, electronics,  machinery, and petrochemical industries, as well as on foreign  capital, foreign trade, technology, and restructuring of  industrial organizations. The State Planning Commission will be  in charge of organizing and coordinating the formulation of  policies.    7. The State Planning Commission is responsible for  interpreting this outline.    This outline will be implemented on the day of promulgation.    Appendix:    Several Provisions Concerning the Enforcement of the  Standard of Economic Scale on Fixed Asset Investment Projects  (the First Batch)    To help readjust the industrial structure and enterprise  organizational setup, to bring into full play the advantage of  economies of scale, to increase the investment returns of  construction projects, and to make Chinese products more  competitive on international markets, the following provisions  are made concerning the enforcement of the standard of economic  scale on fixed asset investment projects for a few fast-selling  products in short market supply and having relatively  conspicuous returns achieved through large-scale production:    1. The standard of economic scale for fixed asset investment  projects is referred to the reasonable construction scale for  projects that have been recently built or expanded, and have  their technology upgraded in the 1990s. The standard of  economic scale is a major component of the state industrial  policy and an important basis for reviewing and approving fixed  asset investment projects. People's governments at various  levels and all relevant departments, as well as enterprises of  all types (including foreign-funded enterprises), should comply  with the standard.    2. Construction projects meeting the standard of economic  scale still need to be submitted for examination and approval  according to the existing procedures; projects below the  standard of economic scale are, in principle, not approved.  However, special consideration will be given to construction  projects below the standard of economic scale in remote regions  with poor transport facilities and economic backwardness. In  such cases, units preparing for construction must first explain  the reasons for the construction and report them to the relevant  departments for examination and approval; and then, based on the  division of work between capital construction and technical  transformation, submit a construction project proposal and a  feasibility report, respectively, to the State Planning  Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission for  examination and approval.    3. The state encourages industrial departments, local  governments, and enterprises to cooperate in setting up limited  liability companies or limited liability stock companies to meet  the standard of economic scale for construction projects. For  projects meeting the standard of economic scale, banks should  give preferential support in terms of loans and use of foreign  exchange. With the approval of the State Council or its  authorized agency, units in charge of such projects may issue  stocks or shares to raise construction funds in accordance with  the procedures stipulated by the state.    4. The State Council shall authorize the State Planning  Commission to work together with the relevant departments in  publishing successively the standard of economic scale of  products with conspicuous returns achieved through large-scale  production, and in making timely revisions of the scale  according to the development of national economy.

Industrial enterprises are called upon to further readjust  their production patterns to meet market demand. As a result,  large industrial groups will be formed and overseas economic  contacts will be greatly enhanced, the officials said.    The city is now making efforts to promote some of its pillar  industries, such as automobiles, program-controlled telephones,  facilities for power stations and computers.    A number of leading state enterprises, especially some  chemical firms, will co-operate with established international  companies to turn out high-tech products with great market  potential.

Korea's exports to China grew by a whopping  165 percent in 1992 and again by 90 percent in 1993. Bilateral  trade between the two countries is expected to grow by an annual  average rate of 33.2 percent between 1993 and 1997 and by 18.9  percent for the 1998- 2001 period. China has also become the  most preferred country for direct investments among Korean  firms. Last year, the government authorized 616 applications  for investment in China, the largest number for a single target  country.    The aggregate amount of Korean investments in China,  however,  is still small because direct investment by Korean firms began  to surge only from 1992. As of the end of 1993, the aggregate  amount of investment authorized by the government is still less  than $1 billion. Of this, $465 million had actually been  invested by the end of last year. China, however, is considered  to be more than a simple trading partner; it is regarded as a  crucial partner for industrial cooperation as well. During  President Kim's visit, the foundation will be laid for strategic  industrial alliance between the two countries.    The government will seek, among other things, an industrial  cooperation agreement with China. Based on the framework to be  provided by the agreement, the soon-to-be-formed Korea-China  Joint Committee for Industrial Cooperation will systematically  promote the industrial alliance. To finance the committee's  activities, the Seoul government will soon inaugurate a fund,  hopefully together with China, of some $6 million.    In the inaugural meeting in Beijing, the committee will  hammer out the principles and types of cooperation, select the  primary areas of cooperation and discuss other avenues of  cooperation.    For Korea, the main fields of cooperation include aircraft,  autos, digital telephone exchanges and nuclear power plants,  while China is interested in cooperation in high-definition TV  (HDTV), facsimile and large-screen color TVs.    In case of aircraft, Korea wants to jointly develop, produce  and sell a commuter aircraft of up to 100 seats. Korea has  already announced an aircraft development plan and China is  expected to be invited to participate in this plan.    In the automobile sector, Korea has been asking China to  allow imports of finished Korean autos and will encourage Korean  parts producers to invest in China.    The Seoul government has also been eager to participate in  China's telephone network modernization programs with Korean-  developed digital telephone exchanges. Cooperation in  developing a next-generation telephone exchanges is also on the  agenda.    The nuclear power sector is another promising avenue of  cooperation as China will construct new nuclear power plants.  The Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) has signed an agreement  to provide operational and management service to the nuclear  power plant in Guangdong Province. Korea may be able to supply  power generation equipment and participate in plant construction.    Korea also plans to help China accumulate technology in such  fields of interest as HDTV [high definition television],  facsimile and large-size color TVs.    Industrial cooperation also involves joint sponsorship of  the  so- called technology mart and exchange of engineers to  facilitate technological exchange in specific sectors and to  help individual firms to address firm-specific needs.    To expand trade further and stimulate direct investment, the  Seoul government will also implement a set of new measures.  First, it intends to increase the provision of loans by the  Export-Import Bank of Korea for deferred payment exports of  Korean industrial facilities to be used for economic development  in China.    According to an official of the Ministry of Trade, Industry  and Energy (MOTIE), the bank is currently evaluating nine  applications for loans amounting to $1.2 billion. Among them is  an application for loans to finance $250 million exports of  rolling stocks to the Guangdong Province of China. The Ex-Im  Bank's loans carry 7-8 percent annual interest rates, not so low  compared with ordinary bank interest rates of around 12 percent.  To alleviate the burden of interest rates on Korean exporters  to China, the government plans to provide them with the Economic  Development Cooperation Funds (EDCF) whose interest rates are  2-2.5 percent a year. The government will expand the coverage of  export insurance for plant exports to China, while at the same  time holding exhibitions of Korean goods in major cities in  China every year.    Within first half of this year, the MOTIE will also come up  with a plan to encourage Korean distributors to advance into  China and build up their own distribution networks. Up till now,  according to a MOTIE official, Korean exports to China have  largely been materials for reexports; Korean goods have not yet  penetrated into the domestic consumption market of China.    Partly, this was the result of the discriminatory tariff  rates against Korean goods which were abolished only in 1992.  Now that Korean goods can compete with foreign products on an  equal footing, Korean exporters are in need of well-functioning  distribution networks just as their Japanese and Hong Kong  rivals do.    This year, the Seoul government will be more prudent in  invoking antidumping and adjustment tariffs against imports from  China to head off unnecessary trade disputes. To stimulate  direct investment in China, MOTIE will select industrial sectors  suitable for production plant transfer to China and will provide  administrative and financial assistance to those who actually  relocate plants. Candidate sectors for this encouragement  measure include footwear and textiles.    Korean investments in China tend to cluster in such  northeastern parts as Shantung and Liaoning Provinces and  Tianjin City near Beijing. According to MOTIE officials,  investments need to be more diversified geographically as each  of the 10 major regions of China has its own development plan.  MOTIE has requested the Korea Institute for Industrial  Economics and Technology to draw up a detailed investment plan  tailored to the development programs of the 10 regions. The  ministry has also told the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA)  to set up trade centers in Dalian and Chonqing this year.  Currently, KOTRA operates trade centers in Beijing and Shanghai.    Korean banks will be encouraged to expand their branch  networks in China and a Korea-China joint venture lease firm  will be promoted to provide Korean firms in China with an easier  access to capital. According to a MOTIE official, the Daewoo and  Halla Business Groups have expressed interest in setting up the  envisioned lease firm.    All these measures are expected to help economic ties  between  Seoul and Beijing evolve into a new dimension. The two  economies are, according to experts, basically complementary in  nature, although in some sectors, they do compete. In  approaching each other, the two countries may as well try to  expand and capitalize on complementarity.     "

While it is computationally efficient, the virtual point source algorithm used in the original ISCLT2 yields estimates of limited accuracy for receptors located near the edges and corners of the area, a problem also seen with the original ISCST2. The algorithm cannot predict the area source impact for receptors located inside the source itself, and does not adequately handle effects of complex source-receptor geometry.   Thus, a new area source algorithm for the ISCLT2, based on the numerical integration algorithm described above, was developed and evaluated. 16  Detailed performance tests, statistical analyses and sensitivity analyses were completed to assure the reliability and reasonableness of the modeling results. Using idealized meteorological conditions, the new algorithm yields very good comparison results when compared with the newly developed ISCST2 area source algorithm. For realistic meteorological data, the differences between ground level concentration values simulated with the new ISCLT2 algorithm and with the new ISCST2 counterpart are within about 10% for a typical source. The differences between the long-term and short-term algorithms using actual meteorological data are because ISCLT2 uses a meteorological frequency distribution to represent the meteorological conditions, and does not contain precise hour-to-hour information on specific combinations of wind speed, wind direction, stability class and mixing height that typically control the design values for the short-term model. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses show that the current ISCLT2 area source algorithm, based on the virtual source approach, routinely underestimates (and underrepresents) the actual maximum concentration impacts by a factor of 2 to 4, especially when the receptors are located inside or near the source.         16     Environmental Protection Agency, 1992.

Governments, trade unions, employers' bodies, industrial tribunals, the press, equal opportunities groups and countless victims have made sure of that. The latest initiative comes from the European Commission, which has just published a booklet* explaining how to construct a policy aimed at stamping out sexual harassment. It is based on the Commission's code of practice, published two years ago. The code consists of a two-pronged - it includes measures to prevent harassment from occurring in the first place and measures to find ways of tackling it once it has happened. It urges companies to: Issue a statement spelling out what counts as harassment, making it clear that such behaviour is unacceptable and describing a procedure through which employees can complain. Make sure that employees know about the policy. Place responsibility on managers to make sure harassment does not occur in their areas. Provide training for managers and for staff processing complaints. Set up formal and informal channels for dealing with complaints. Designate someone to give advice and assistance. Make sure cases are investigated quickly and by a committee set up for the purpose. Mete out suitable disciplinary measures to guilty parties. Slowly, companies are beginning to realise something needs to be done. The telephone lines have been increasingly busy at the UK's Equal Opportunities Commission, which runs a service advising employers on how to combat harassment. In 1990, an average of one employer a week used the service. By last year, the EOC was receiving about two inquiries a day and the numbers are rising. A similar picture emerges from recent research by Industrial Relations Services, the pay and conditions research group. It found that a third of British employers had a policy to deal with sexual harassment and a further third were considering introducing one. However, the mere existence of a policy does not mean it is having any impact. Indeed, it seems many companies have policies which fall short of the EC's guidelines. A recent survey by the Industrial Society shows that more than a fifth of UK employees do not know if their organisation has a sexual harassment policy or not. The EC booklet says companies without a policy are open to litigation from employees who have been the victims of harassment. Agnes Hubert, head of the European Commission's equal opportunities unit, says a policy may also save companies money. 'Organisations should think seriously about the cumulative cost of replacing staff affected, paying sick leave to employees who miss work because of stress, and the implications of reduced productivity - all expensive drains on morale and efficiency', she says. The priority attached to the issue varies in different countries. The report is peppered with best practice examples from the Netherlands, where many organisations have gone beyond the guidelines by instituting training and setting up external complaints commissions. *How to Combat Sexual Harassment at Work, available from Commission of the European Communities, 8 Storey's Gate, London, SW1P 3AT.

During production, parts and tools must be available at the  right time and at the right machine. Flexibly automated  solutions for all requirements are helpful with this.    The integration of sensors, electronics, image and data  processing in assembly and handling technology leads to cost  reduction even for small lots. Lean production here as well.  That does not, however, mean simpler or trimmed-down technology,  but rather more automation, more flexibility, yet in less  complex and thus more easily comprehensible units.    Demands for shorter cycle times, greater reliability and  availability, greater precision with consistent quality and  lower costs can for the most part only be met with automated  assembly and handling. [Working conditions which] take their  toll on workers' health, such as heavy, noisy, monotonous  activities, can be minimized or eliminated entirely. Procedures  carried out in extremely dangerous environments can, in fact,  only be done with automation.    Automation in Assembly Becomes Increasingly  Extensive    In 1992 the German assembly, handling and industrial robots  (AHI) industry had sales of 3.9 billion German marks [DM]  compared with DM4.1 billion in the previous year. In 1993, there  was no impetus in either the domestic market or in exports, so a  decline of 5 to 7% in sales is to be expected. Along with  assembly technology and handling technology--including  industrial robots--standard components and peripherals for  systems technology are also part of the AHI industry. ""We  estimate the 1992 sales for this group at DM1.1 billion,"" says  Dr. Ing. Heinz Muno, director of the Assembly, Handling,  Industrial Robots (AHI) trade association in Frankfurt am Main.  This corresponds to a 26%-share of the industry's total  sales.  Standard components and peripherals round out assembly and  handling equipment as complete systems.    Assembly technology and handling technology each received  about DM1.4 billion, or 37% apiece. A shift in this share  is  becoming apparent for 1993. Continued development of sensor  technology and control and process control technology is making  automation of complex assembly processes progressively easier.  The proportion of business done in assembly technology and  standard components and peripherals is increasing  correspondingly, while handling technology has already reached a  high level of automation.    The export quota for the approximately 200 mostly mid-sized  companies in the German industry averages 35%. The  importance  of the countries of the European Community as trade partners for  these companies can be illustrated with the example of  industrial robots. For 1992, exports came to 181 million German  marks, 75% of which remained within the internal market.  Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy were in first place as buyer  countries with 18% each, followed by France at 15%.    Machine building is gradually rebounding from the depths of  the recession. The assembly and handling technology companies  are providers and outfitters for the entire industry. Because of  this, however, they are also dependent on the economic situation  of their buyers. The difficult worldwide economic situation  correspondingly affects foreign as well as domestic demand in  this field of automation.    Important consumer areas such as machine building and the  automobile and the electronics industries have for some time  been experiencing substantial setbacks in incoming orders. For  German machine building, for example, talk is of the deepest  recession in the last 40 years. The initially normal cyclical  slowdown in the economy has become aggravated by the fact that  since 1992 all other industrial nations--and thus trading  partners--have also found themselves in a tailspin. Yet the  beginning of the decline in economic activity was certainly  variable in the individual countries: first the symptoms of  weakening in Great Britain, Scandinavia and the United States;  then Germany's drop, and finally the dramatic decline in Japan.    In 1993, the demand for machines in West Europe as a whole  declined about 8%. That, however, only resulted in a loss  of  5% for production, since exports to North and Latin  America,  Asia and East Europe as well have gone up. Because of the great  importance of the internal market as a sales arena for European  companies, the increase in exports to countries outside the  Community cannot compensate for the weak demand in the home  market. Some European countries have, however, already reached  the bottom of the recession, while others are already even able  to record a growth in machine production. Among these are the  Scandinavian countries (with the exception of Denmark), Great  Britain, Ireland and Italy.    Exports and thereby--at long last--machine production,  especially in Italy, are profiting from the [currency]  devaluations in the course of last year's turbulent monetary  conditions. Low interest and pressures to modernize and  streamline could also contribute some impetus. German machine  production can assume for 1994 a mild revival of output of  2%  in real terms. This is supported substantially by overseas  exports. The West European demand for machines will probably  stagnate.    Machine Production Will Emerge from the Recession in  Better Shape    The same is true for domestic demand to the extent that it  is  not dependent on exports. The cyclical fluctuations in the  economic situation could be surmounted by 1995 and 1996. Machine  production might count among the winners, not least because many  companies are using the recession to restructure. They will  emerge from this process in stronger condition.    The companies of the AHI industry stand by their customers  as  reliable partners in automation with innovative and customer-  specific solutions and appropriate service provisions. ""Module  technology"" permits flexible planning of production and simple  reorganization--a contribution to the competitiveness of the  buyers. German machine production has forged for itself a  leading roll in international competition with its top level  accomplishments in technology. More than 20% of the  exports  worldwide come from Germany with about 15% each from the  USA  and Japan.    German machine production also has to thank for its position  its subcontractors and suppliers who for their part provide  high-tech products. The newest developments in the automation of  assembly and handling processes as well as an overview of the  international state of technology are being offered by the more  than 200 exhibitors at the approximately 13,000 m[.sup]2[/]  exhibition area of the Assembly, Handling, Industrial Robot  Trade Show being held in conjunction with the Hannover Trade  Show from 20 to 27 April 1994.    Running parallel to this, the 25th International Symposium  on  Industrial Robots is taking place from 25 to 27 April. Practical  examples will illustrate diverse and efficiency-increasing  possibilities for using industrial robots. In addition to  assembly and handling technology, themes include robot  components, control systems, image processing, surface  technology, welding, bonding, and new areas of applications such  as service robotics.

The fodder, rich in protein, consists of different nutrients  needed for accelerating the growth of livestocks.    Particularly, it contains more ferment, vitamin and other  activated materials than other fodder.    The albuminous fodder increases the daily growing rate of  pig  or duck 20 percent higher than other fodder.    The quantity of fodder consumption is notably diminished and  the rate of protein digestion rises by far.    The fodder is made from rice straw, cornhusk, corncob,  sawdust and other cellulose materials by a diastatic method.    150 or 200 kilograms of albuminous fodder, 30 kilograms of  microbial protein and some alcohol are obtained from one ton of  cornhusk.    The cellulose albuminous fodder, which has been rapidly  introduced in stockbreeding in Korea, was developed by the  scientists and technicians of the protein synthesis section  under the Institute of the Industrial Microbiology of the  Academy of Sciences.

Feldman, American Petroleum Institute, 1220 L Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C. 20005, (202) 6828340         Abstract         HGSYSTEM is a software package consisting of mathematical models for simulating one or more of the consecutive phases between spillage and far-field dispersion of a non-reactive ideal gas or hydrogen fluoride (HF). The individual models can be described as follows: (1) HFSPILL calculates the time-dependent spill rate of HF liquid or HF vapor from a pressurized vessel; (2) EVAP calculates the spreading and evaporation of a boiling liquid pool on water or non-boiling liquid pool on land; (3) HFPLUME calculates the depressurization to ambient pressure, the jet release and the near-field dispersion from a pressurized release of HF; (4) PLUME calculates the depressurization to ambient pressure, the jet release and the near-field dispersion from a pressurized release of non-reactive, ideal gases; (5) HEGADAS calculates the steady-state or time-dependent ground-level heavy-gas dispersion resulting from either a ground-level pool or a source in a vertical plane; and (6) PGPLUME simulates passive-gas dispersion downwind of a transition point based on a simple Pasquill/Gifford similarity model. The models assume flat, unobstructed terrain. HGSYSTEM can be used to model steady-state, finite-duration and time-dependent releases. The models can be run in either the interactive or batch mode.         a. Recommendations for Regulatory Use         HGSYSTEM can be used as a refined model to estimate short-term ambient concentrations. For toxic chemical releases (non-reactive chemicals or hydrogen fluoride; 1-hour or less averaging times) the expected area of exposure to concentrations above specified threshold values can be determined. For flammable non-reactive gases it can be used to determine the area in which the cloud may ignite.         b. Input Requirements         1. HFSPILL input data: reservoir data (temperature, pressure, volume, HF mass, mass-fraction water), pipe-exit diameter and ambient pressure.     2. EVAP input data: spill rate, liquid properties, and evaporation rate (boiling pool) or ambient data (non-boiling pool).     3. HFPLUME and PLUME input data: reservoir characteristics, pollutant parameters, pipe/release data, ambient conditions, surface roughness and stability class.     4. HEGADAS input data: ambient conditions, pollutant parameters, pool data or data at transition point, surface roughness, stability class and averaging time.     5. PGPLUME input data: link data provided by HFPLUME and the averaging time.         c. Output         1. The HGSYSTEM models contain three post-processor programs which can be used to extract modeling results for graphical display by external software packages. GET2COL can be used to extract data from the model output files. HSPOST can be used to develop isopleths, extract any 2 parameters for plotting and correct for finite release duration. HTPOST can be used to produce time history plots.     2. HFSPILL output data: reservoir mass, spill rate, and other reservoir variables as a function of time. For HF liquid, HFSPILL generates link data to HFPLUME for the initial phase of choked liquid flow (flashing jet), and link data to EVAP for the subsequent phase of unchoked liquid flow (evaporating liquid pool).     3. EVAP output data: pool dimensions, pool evaporation rate, pool mass and other pool variables for steady state conditions or as a function of time. EVAP generates link data to the dispersion model HEGADAS (pool dimensions and pool evaporation rate).     4. HFPLUME and PLUME output data: plume variables (concentration, width, centroid height, temperature, velocity, etc.) as a function of downwind distance.     5. HEGADAS output data: concentration variables and temperature as a function of downwind distance and (for transient case) time.     6. PGPLUME output data: concentration as a function of downwind distance, cross-wind distance and height.         d. Type of Model         HGSYSTEM is made up of four types of dispersion models. HFPLUME and PLUME simulate the near-field dispersion and PGPLUME simulates the passive-gas dispersion downwind of a transition point. HEGADAS simulates the ground-level heavy-gas dispersion.         e. Pollutant Types         HGSYSTEM may be used to model non-reactive chemicals or hydrogen fluoride.            "

The powerful business organization made the request as the  government began to study measures to regulate exports of such  products in line with its policy of preventing proliferation of  nuclear and conventional weapons.    The government plans to enforce regulations on the basis of  a  recommendation to be made by the Industrial Structure Council,  an advisory body to the minister of international trade and  industry.    Keidanren said the proposed regulation will have a serious  impact on domestic manufacturers, particularly on those who are  not familiar with export controls.    The federation called on the government to hear views from  industries concerned in working out new regulations and give  them enough time for familiarization, the officials said.     "

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Siemens of Norway, the offshoot of the German group which owns Kongsberg, expects the deal to be completed by the end of the second quarter of this year. FMC, which supplies chemicals and equipment to the oil, gas and agriculture industries, said the acquisition would strengthen its position in the underwater systems market. The US group has co-operated with Kongsberg Offshore since 1987, with the latter supplying electronic controls for FMC-produced underwater oil and gas production equipment. Siemens Norway said undersea production technology was not a core business area of the group, which had decided to concentrate on its core businesses. The deal is subject to approval by the two companies' boards of directors and Norwegian authorities.   Companies:-  FMC Corp.   Countries:-  NOZ  Norway, West Europe.

0,FT931-8158 ,"FT931-8158 _AN-DBUAKACFFT 930220   FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: ICI faces decision on how to raise Pounds 1bn of new equity      By MAGGIE URRY   IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Indust-ries, which is expected to announce on Thursday that it will proceed with its demerger plan, must also decide how to raise about Pounds 1bn of new equity regarded as essential to make the split work. The ICI board, chaired by Sir Denys Henderson, is understood to have set itself a number of goals in the financing, some of which appear to conflict. First, it is keen to reward loyal shareholders who supported ICI when Hanson took its 2.8 per cent stake in 1991 by preserving their pre-emption rights. ICI also wants the certainty of an underwritten issue, which many think can only be done in the UK market, so that it can proceed with the demerger with confidence. These two factors would tend to push ICI towards a rights issue, either before the demerger, or by Zeneca, the pharmaceutical side, after the demerger. However, Zeneca would like to widen its spread of shareholders, building an international, and especially US, investor base. 'That concept is clearly very important in the mind of Zeneca,' said one person involved. Only about 5 per cent of ICI's shares are held in the US. ICI and SG Warburg, its adviser, are looking closely at the Wellcome share sale last summer, which was designed to increase overseas ownership of the drug company's shares. The Wellcome sale was done on a 'book-building' basis. Potential buyers put bids in during a sale period and a price was set reflecting supply and demand. The price set was close to the market price, whereas a rights issue is normally made at a significant discount to the market price. But Wellcome did not face a pre-emption rights problem as the shares being sold were existing rather than new ones. Investment bankers are being asked to put proposals to ICI which can bring the differing aims into line. One suggestion is that Zeneca should proceed with a rights issue, but that the company should attempt to generate demand from new investors for the new shares while they are trading in nil-paid form. That could involve an international road show to whip up interest in the shares. That could prove an expensive option for Zeneca though, as it would mean issuing shares on a rights issue discount and then giving shareholders a profit if new investors are encouraged to buy. Another approach could be to run a book building sale which would probably set a strike price closer to the market price, but to give existing shareholders the right to buy back a large proportion of the issue at the strike price. That would have the advantage of preserving pre-emptive rights, and obtaining a better price for the shares. But it would be hard to combine that with a firm underwriting commitment. The hope of broadening the investor base to include US holders also depends on Zeneca being able to attract interest. Pharmaceutical stocks are out of favour at present, especially in the US. Zeneca itself is seen as weak. American sales of its best-selling drug, the heart drug Tenormin, have halved over the last 12 months following the expiry of its patents. And according to one banker, Zeneca has 'nothing promising in the RD pipeline for a couple of years. Are US investors prepared for a 2 to 3 year wait?'.   Companies:-  Imperial Chemical Industries.

BHP said the business - which claims to be the world's largest producer of fibre-optic couplers - required an established industry parent to maximise its growth potential, and ADC was better suited to this role. BHP acquired the business in 1990. Separately, the company announced that Mr Frederic Hamilton, founder of the Hamilton Oil business which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BHP, would step down as chief executive of the unit in December.

The four Korean ships, 300-400 ton  large, are Petro 301 and Petro 303 of Taeung Deep Sea Fisheries  Co., Tongwon 311 of Tongwon Industries Co. and Chaewon 22 of  Chaewon Industrial Co.    The vessels, fishing within 200 nautical miles of  Argentina's  ""territorial waters,"" tried to escape after the Argentine Navy  ordered them to stop but were later captured, Argentine  authorities said. Korean fishing sources here said four Korean  vessels are confirmed to have been captured, but the figure may  rise to seven. The incident marks the first time that the  Argentine Navy, instead of the Coast Guard, has seized several  Korean ships at a time for entering the zone and could cause a  diplomatic dispute, informed sources said.    The Korean ships' catch will be confiscated and they face a  fine of at least 500,000 U.S. dollars.     "

Far from it. Input prices are only a relatively small proportion of total manufacturing costs. Declines in manufacturing productivity over the past few months, and consequent increases in unit wage costs, have been significant contributory factors to the 3.7 per cent rise in output costs recorded by the CSO index. Margins, according to a reading of these indices, are flat. Further scrutiny of the official data and evidence from several industrial sectors suggest these price indices do not fully reflect the increasing extent of trade discounting. Taking these factors into account, manufacturers' unit profit margins are undoubtedly still falling.

The finance minister, Mr Ivan Kocarnik, is confident the government's 1993 targets will be met, though with a more modest growth rate of 1 per cent and with inflation - aggravated by the introduction of value added tax in January - at around 17 per cent. The Czech National Bank endorsed the minister's cautious optimism in a report showing private and public demand rising 12 per cent and 16 per cent respectively in the first half of the year compared with the period in 1992. But analysts believe it will be difficult to turn around an economy labouring under a fourth consecutive year of declining output. Industrial production dropped 4 per cent and gross domestic product fell 1 per cent in the first six months compared with last year, when output already had declined sharply. Efforts to build a market economy have been hampered by recession in western Europe, the collapse of traditional markets in the east, and the extra costs arising from the break-up of Czechoslovakia. Rising protectionism in western markets has been an additional handicap, though, apart from sensitive sectors such as steel, the overall effect on the Czech economy of restrictions on imports into the European Community have been exaggerated by politicians. The Czech Republic has a trade surplus with the EC. Industry is running below capacity, but this is due not simply to lack of access to markets, but also to poor marketing skills and structures. Czech industry also needs time and capital to modernise and improve product quality. The Industry Ministry recently warned that the lower quality and rising costs of Czech products - at a time when recession and devaluations made western European manufacturers more competitive - was causing a decline in local demand. Officials fear that big companies such as Volkswagen, which is currently going through fierce cost-cutting measures, could abandon plans to develop local supplier networks for its Skoda venture in the Czech Republic and turn to west European producers instead. The staunchly free market government of the prime minister, Mr Vaclav Klaus, has rejected calls for a devaluation to make Czech products more competitive, saying companies must become more efficient. The government is concerned that inflation and rapidly rising wages could undermine prospects of recovery and frighten foreign investors, who invested more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in the Czech territory in the three years before Czechoslovakia split. The average industrial wage has risen by more than 22 per cent compared with a year ago - while productivity has stagnated - and Mr Klaus is determined to bring wages under control. He says that Germany's economic success was built on productivity growing faster than wages. Labour costs are still about a tenth of those in Germany, but competition for investment from other ex-communist countries is fierce. However, with unemployment at 148,600, or 2.8 per cent, the Klaus warning loses much of its impact. Prague has no unemployment. Laid-off workers are absorbed in the city's bustling private sector. Extensive indebtedness is another problem. About a third of privatised companies are believed to be technically bankrupt. Total inter-company debt is estimated at about Kcs 150bn (Pounds 3.48bn). Since a new bankruptcy law came into force in April there has been a steady trickle of official bankruptcies, but its full effect has yet to be felt.

The group will lift its dividend payment to NK5 a share from NKr3. The weaker result was due to substantial losses by the group's mechanical engineering and shipping divisions. Shipping operations plunged into a NKr115m pre-tax loss last year from a NKr4m profit in 1991 while mechanical engineering widened pre-tax losses to NKr232m from NKr51m. Shipbuilding, which accounted for nearly 80 per cent of group profits, increased pre-tax profit by NKr204m to NKr735m last year. Group net revenue rose to NKr20bn from NKr18.7bn in 1991, but operating costs increased to NKr18.4bn from NKr16.9bn.

0,FT931-1100 ,"FT931-1100 _AN-DCZBZAEHFT 930326   FT  26 MAR 93 / Management: Absent without leave - Nigel Nicholson examines ways of encouraging employee attendance in the workplace      By NIGEL NICHOLSON   When it comes to absenteeism, is Britain in a poor state of health? A report published this month by the Industrial Society suggests that it is, describing how Japanese-owned businesses in the UK outperform British companies in attendance rates. The report attributes this to better monitoring and internal communications and to Japanese companies' emphasis on teamwork. Absence rates in Britain have been falling over recent decades, partly reflecting better management and healthier workforces. But the cost in terms of lost production is still large. Could this be reduced further? People cannot be expected to fall sick only at weekends or during holidays. Moreover, one worker's time off for flu is another's escape from infection. It could be argued that tolerance of reasonable absenteeism - even allowing workers occasional mental health days - is a goodwill investment and an insurance against abuse. This depends upon a high degree of trust and shared awareness between employers and staff. On this count, British companies do not score highly. Absence is, for many, a forgotten problem. Records are rudimentary, communication of attendance data is negligible and control measures are crude and ill-focused. For these reasons, getting a grip on absenteeism can yield substantial savings. The first step is to ensure that records are accurate and informative, counting not just crude percentage time lost but also the number of separate absence spells. There is a world of difference when it comes to corporate efficiency between one worker being absent for five working days and five workers each taking one day off: most firms' records are incapable of making the distinction. Simple computerised recording systems are widely available which can provide this and other breakdowns. The second step is to raise awareness of absence levels across the firm. Absence has too often been seen as a personnel rather than an operations issue and line management should have responsibility for monitoring individual behaviour and achieving improvements. There is a need for attendance to be seen by everyone as a dimension of performance. The third step is to provide attendance incentives. Most corporate thinking about this is limited to a carrot and stick philosophy, often forgetting the carrot. The stick is discipline. But this can backfire, as in the case of the company which cracked down on offenders but lacked the means of discriminating between the unfortunate and the culpable. Although it managed to cut off the peak of worst offenders, aggregate absence levels rose. The disciplinary policy netted several who felt unfairly penalised, and the result was that absence levels for many rose to just below the level at which sanctions kicked in. Management had declared the rules of the game and the employees were playing it accordingly. If the stick does not work, what about the carrot? Most companies immediately think this means material rewards. But this raises further problems. Management, quite understandably, is reluctant to give additional rewards for what staff are contractually obliged to do and experience shows the positive effects tend not to last. The incentive is rarely great enough to be compelling; it looks like rewarding luck rather than motivation if people are disqualified for unavoidable illness, and bonuses have a way of becoming assimilated as just another element of the package. Research shows the most effective and under-used incentive is almost costless. It is recognition. Good absence information systems raise awareness of attendance performance. The most effective disincentive here is a shared awareness of attributable costs and this is where the Japanese teamwork culture generates control. Attendance-motivated workers are found in companies where individuals are aware of how their absence affects group performance, with the implicit sanction of group disapproval for abuse. This is only likely to occur where groups are inter-dependent enough for individual behaviour to be visible. But how does this relate to illness and stress - cited in the Industrial Society report as prime causes of absenteeism? The two are connected. Employees are more liable to become ill when bored, unhappy and demotivated. Absence has two interacting causes: risk and susceptibility. For example, an unhealthy lifestyle is a risk factor, and low morale a susceptibility factor. The risk multiplied by susceptibility equation explains why young and low-status workers have the highest rates of absence. They are at risk through lifestyle and health factors, and are most susceptible through their lower attachment to work. The Industrial Society confirms the equation. The lowest absence occurs where risks are minimised through careful hiring policy and preventive health programmes, and susceptibility is minimised through trust. Absence is a lens through which poor management practice is magnified. The Japanese experience shows how the values of involvement and improvement challenge British management to new ways of managing employee performance.

Mobile sources.    _(1) Highway vehicle emission factors. The on-highway emission factors for California vehicles are based on CAL15a, which is the March 1993 release of MOBILE5a with modified model year emission control groupings, basic emission rates, and registration age mix based on EMFAC7D.       The EMFAC model could not be used for the FIP for several reasons. Most importantly, an enhanced I/M program is a key part of the FIP proposal, and EMFAC does not allow the examination of I/M programs besides the one currently implemented in California. Similarly, there is no mechanism within EMFAC to address the enhanced in-use compliance program being proposed in the FIP.     There is now an in-house EPA version of MOBILE5a for California based on EMFAC7F, EMFAC7D's replacement, referred to simply as CAL15. More detailed descriptions of CAL15a and CAL15 are provided in the docket. EPA currently plans to use CAL15 in subsequent analyses for the FIP. EPA invites comments on the merits of the various models. Based on these comments and any new data that may become available, EPA may make inventory and control effectiveness adjustments in the final FIP. Such technical adjustments could require or allow changes in the control measures.       Vehicles certified to 49State standards are assumed to comprise 10 percent of the light duty VMT and 20 percent of the heavy duty VMT in the FIP areas. The emission factors for these vehicles were based on MOBILE5a runs using the same inputs as for the CAL15a runs, except the LEV program was excluded, since it would not apply to 49-State vehicles.       It should be noted that the baseline emission calculations include control programs that have already been adopted. This includes the California LEV program, California Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline, and California Clean Diesel Fuel.          "

The device is 1.4 millimeters in diameter and has a pivot  that rotates 100 to 160 times a minute, said officials at the  institute, a subsidiary of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.,  one of the world's largest electronics manufacturers.    To make the motor, researchers covered a ceramic pivot one  millimeter in diameter with resin, fixed 16 electrodes to the  resin and enveloped them in a cylinder. Then they dissolved the  resin to let the pivot rotate within the cylinder.    They aim to upgrade the motor several years from now to  produce as much power as the one currently used for pagers,  which is 1.2 centimeters long and six millimeters in diameter,  said Takeo Sato of the institute based in Kawasaki, Kanagawa  Prefecture.    The motor could be applicable to micro-technology for use in  human blood vessels to check or treat diseases, he said.     "

Listing of Actions, Failures, and Refusals That Subject Individuals to Penalties        Finally, OSM, in the November 12, 1993, letter, notified North Dakota that, unlike section 518(f) of SMCRA, proposed NDCC 3812.108 does not explicitly include failure of refusal to comply with orders of the Commission as cause to subject individuals to penalties. In addition, OSM noted that the North Dakota coal exploration program does not explicitly address the issuance of orders by the Commission and that the program was approved by OSM on the basis of North Dakota's agreement to issue each coal exploration permit with a specific condition subjecting it to the requirements of 30 CFR 840, 842, 843, 845, and 43 CFR part 4 (see 45 FR 82214, 82226; December 15, 1980) Section 518(f) of SMCRA subjects individuals to penalties when corporate permittees fail or refuse to comply with enforcement orders or any order (with minor exceptions) incorporated in a final decision of the regulatory authority.    In the December 3, 1993, letter, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that its provisions at NDCC 3812.108 regarding liability and penalties for failure to comply with orders of the Industrial Commission should be clearer, and expressed its willingness to approach the North Dakota Legislature in 1995 to request an amendment to NDCC 3812.108 to include civil and criminal penalties for violations such orders.    The Director agrees that North Dakota must amend NDCC 3812.108. Therefore, the Director is not approving proposed NDCC 3812.108 and is requiring North Dakota to amend its program to require that, in addition to violations, failure or refusal to comply with such orders, as listed in section 518(f) of SMCRA and issued by the North Dakota Industrial Commission, serves as an additional basis for imposing individual civil and criminal penalties upon corporate officers, directors, and agents. The required program amendment placed on North Dakota's program at 30 CFR 934.16(y), as a result of a January 9, 1992, rulemaking action (57 FR 807, 82324) will be modified to reflect this decision.

Most of the 63 international banks in the Euro Disney syndicates are understood to have agreed in principle to the rescue. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Banque Indosuez, joint leaders of the banks' steering committee, hope by Friday to have finalised the agreement. But the banks have yet to agree terms for underwriting of the rights issue. Japanese creditors - including LTCB of Japan, Mitsubishi Trust, Sumitomo, Bank of Tokyo and Industrial Bank of Japan - are reluctant to be involved with the underwriting. The Japanese banks yesterday pressed BNP and Indosuez for exemption from the underwriting. They also urged that the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, which is Euro Disney's biggest lender, should play a larger part in the restructuring.   Companies:-  Euro Disney.

ACTION:     Solicitation for Financial Assistance.            SUMMARY:     Notice is hereby given pursuant to Public Law 93577, and Federal Non-nuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Idaho Operations Office (ID), is seeking cost-shared applications to expedite private sector deployment of cost effective new and advanced natural gas combustion systems which improve efficiency and reduce combustion emissions significantly without post-combustion controls. To encourage commercialization of the developed technology, applications are expected to include direct participation by an industrial partner (equipment manufacturers, the end user industry sector or the natural gas industry). A minimum 20% non-DOE cost-share for research and development phases and a minimum 50% non-DOE cost-share for the demonstration phase is required. The applicant or one of the industrial partners is expected to be an organization that will market the equipment developed and demonstrated as a result of this solicitation. This is a complete solicitation document.          DATES:     The effective date of this solicitation is February 4, 1994. The deadline for receipt of applications is 4 p.m. MDT, May 5, 1994.           ADDRESSES:     Applications shall be submitted to:     NUMBER DEPS0794ID13285     J.O. Lee, Contracting Officer; Procurement Services Division; U.S. Department of Energy; 785 DOE Place, MS 1221, Idaho Falls, ID 834011562.          FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Dallas L. Hoffer, Contract Specialist, (208) 5260014.       Background       U.S. Industry burns eighteen percent of all fuels combusted in the U.S. for all purposes. Wide spread adoption of combustion equipment incorporating even a small improvement in efficiency can, on a nation-wide basis, result in significant energy savings which translate into significant cost savings.   Projects sponsored by the DOE Industrial Combustion Equipment Program are based on the needs and concerns of industry. The program advances technology to the point of commercialization. Historically, activities have focused on the development of energy efficient, environmentally benign combustion equipment for use in one or more high energy consuming manufacturing industries.   The on-going implementation of clean air regulations is making environmental considerations a major factor in the adoption of the equipment developed by this DOE Program. Low emissions are expected to be the major incentive for adoption of these energy saving technologies by industry.   Title I of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), requires some ozone non-attainment areas to meet 9 ppm or lower NOx standards for new industrial combustion equipment. This emission target can now be met only by using Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems which have high capital and operating costs and which may have a substantial energy penalty, resulting in low overall energy efficiency. The need to use SCR systems on new industrial units has been a serious impediment to the replacement of existing equipment which is generally ``grandfathered'' and may require no emission controls or minimal controls such as low NOx burners for continued operation. As a consequence, industry has kept old, inefficient equipment operating, often far beyond the anticipated or design life of that equipment.   The opportunity now exists for the U.S. to introduce very low emission combustion equipment for use by industry. Emissions would be in the range now realized with post-combustion equipment controls, but these costly, inefficient downstream systems would not be needed. Mandated emissions targets would be met by using equipment based on advanced natural gas combustion techniques and would be realized by replacing or retrofitting existing furnaces, heaters, and boilers with these advanced systems. Energy efficiency, a traditional DOE goal, would be at least equal to today's best industrial combustion equipment. Overall, substantial energy would be saved since the energy required to operate post-combustion control systems and produce and transport their chemical reagents would not be needed.   Increased energy efficiency decreases the emission of greenhouse gasses as an additional benefit. In addition, combustion of natural gas releases less carbon dioxide per unit energy than from other fossil fuels.   This work responds to the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992 (Public Law 102486), Title XXII (Energy and Economic Growth), enabled October 24, 1992. Section 2014 directs the development of efficient, low emission combustion equipment that uses natural gas.            "

The protests are not co-ordinated and have been called for various reasons. Under emergency rules, certain flights are guaranteed, including many intercontinental flights arriving in Italy. Alitalia has specifically warned of flight cancellations and delays between 10am and 6pm on Wednesday because of a strike by cabin staff and air traffic controllers. Some workers are protesting against the Italian government's budget plans, some against new contract proposals, and others against the planned merger between Alitalia and its domestic subsidiary, Ati. Last Friday, eight out of 10 Ati pilots reported sick, forcing cancellation of 113 mainly domestic flights. The pilots, most of whom were back at work by yesterday, object to the Alitalia-Ati merger, which they claim will hinder promotion. They plan an official strike on Friday.

The latest survey of business trends, conducted by the Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands just before the Budget and covering 494 companies, demonstrates the shallowness of economic recovery and offers an antidote to optimism. Recent regional surveys had suggested that the west Midlands, with its dependence on manufacturing, would be one of the regions to emerge from recession most quickly. Engineering employers reported yesterday that the proportion of companies experiencing an increase in domestic orders fell to 37 per cent in November from 46 per cent in May. Those experiencing a rise in export orders fell to 22 per cent from 27 per cent. Twenty one per cent of companies expect a fall in capacity utilisation over the next three months.

Gardner Merchant, the catering group sold by Forte last year to management and set to come to the market later this year, was being mooted as the most likely candidate, with a price tag of around Pounds 600m being attached. Leisure analysts, while agreeing that the move would make strategic sense to Granada, said that it was unlikely given both its recent foray and Gardner Merchant's imminent flotation. 'Granada would have to pay a lot to stop that happening,' was the view of one seasoned professional. Forte, which will reap 25 per cent from any float, crept a half-penny forward to 232p, while Granada managed a penny gain to 533 1/2 p. ICI put on 4 at 837p after the UK's leading chemicals company released second-quarter figures above the range of analysts' forecasts and accompanied them with a strong statement. The profits of Pounds 141m translated to a first-half gain of Pounds 234m, against forecasts of Pounds 205m to Pounds 225m. Sir Denys Henderson, the chairman, said: 'This is the most tangible evidence yet that our customers are emerging from recession.' Forecasts for the full year shifted from a range of Pounds 400m to Pounds 450m to between Pounds 450m and Pounds 500m, but many analysts remained just holders of the stock, arguing that it was already expensive. SmithKline Beecham fell as initial reports suggested that the US Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee had decided not to approve the company's best selling drug Tagamet as an over-the-counter treatment for heartburn. The shares dropped 11 1/2 to 408p but, after the market closed, SmithKline announced that recommendation had been given subject to one or two small points. It said that if those points were cleared up, the drug would not have to be referred back to the advisory committee. News that Medeva, the pharmaceuticals company, had lost a significant European appeal case came too late to affect the shares, which ended steady at 134p. But one analyst said the decision to uphold the patent on a hepatitis B drug held by Biogen, of the US, could prompt a significant fall in the Medeva share price when the market opens today. The hepatitis B vaccine is seen as one of the prime sources of Medeva's earnings growth in the next five years. Analysts had been looking for sales of around Pounds 30m next year. News that conglomerate Hanson had made a Pounds 96.1m recommended offer for Scholes, manufacturer of electrical products, at 250p a share was not the blockbuster bid that many had expected. Analysts are looking for further acquisitions but some said that much depended on the strength of the dollar and its impact on the group's high level of dollar denominated debt. Scholes rose 57 to 250p while Hanson improved 3 to 258p, the shares receiving further support from a recommendation by Nomura which urged investors to switch their holdings from industrial conglomerate BTR, which eased 2 to 370p. Office equipment group Danka Business hardened 3 to 333p after reporting bumper first-quarter profits Rolls-Royce advanced 7 1/2 to 188 1/2 p, with investment bank Lehman Brothers reported to have been an aggressive bidder for stock in the second half of the session, to cover a position on a warrant issue. Food processing equipment manufacturer APV firmed 2 to 114p after NatWest Securities upgraded profits expectations for the current year by Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 26.8m.

The preliminary results of its business and consumer confidence survey for November showed that consumer confidence remained unchanged between October and November, after rising rapidly since the start of the year. Industrial confidence, by contrast, rose for the 16th successive month, almost reaching record levels. The lowest level of consumer confidence was recorded in Portugal, where consumers remain deeply gloomy about their country's economic prospects over the next 12 months. Consumers in Italy were the second most pessimistic, although this largely reflected concern about their household finances, rather than the country's economic prospects as a whole. The country with the strongest consumer confidence was Denmark, where consumers were very upbeat both about their country's economic prospects over the next year and about their own finances. Consumers in Ireland were also relatively upbeat.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).     PTZ  Portugal, EC.     ITZ  Italy, EC.     DKZ  Denmark, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

The research organisation, which received detailed responses from 33 out of the 160 first- and second-wave trusts, found that some staff working for 80 per cent of the respondents were on local terms, but they were mainly managers or specific occupational groups such as healthcare assistants. Some analysts argue that a crucial element in the government's health reforms is the more effective use of labour, with local managers breaking away from the Whitley system of national pay bargaining. 'Lack of management time and resources' is the reason most frequently given for caution in making change. Slightly more trusts have cut staff than increased it (12 and 10 respectively) since gaining self-governing status and over 40 per cent of respondents expect staff numbers to fall in the next 18 months.

0," FR941007-2-00013   FR941007-2-00006        De Jure Analysis        The PRC laws placed on the record of this case establish that the responsibility for managing companies owned by ``all the people'' has been transferred from the government to the enterprise itself. These laws include: ``Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (1988 Law); ``Regulations for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved on August 23, 1992 (1992 Regulations); and the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,'' approved on December 21, 1992 (Export Provisions). The 198l8 Law states that enterprises have the right to set their own prices (    see     Article 26). This principle was restated in the     1992 Regulations     (    see     Article IX). The Export Provisions list those products subject to direct government control. Paper clips do not appear on the Export Provisions list and are not, therefore, subject to the constraints of these provisions.    Consistent with Silicon Carbide, we determined that the existence of these laws demonstrates that ZMEC and ZLIP, companies owned by ``all the people,'' are not subject to     de jure     control.    Since Lansheng was initially a company owned by ``all the people,'' the laws cited above establish that the government devolved control over Lansheng by law. The only additional law that may be pertinent to the     de jure     analysis of Lansheng as a share company is the Company Law (effective July 1, 1994). While Lansheng indicated that it was organized consistent with the Company Law, the law did not enter into force until nine months after the POI. In any event, this law does not alter the government's     de jure     devolution of control that occurred when the company was owned by ``all the people.'' Therefore, we have determined that Lansheng is not subject to     de jure     control.     In light of reports 3  indicating that laws shifting control control from the government to the enterprises themselves have not been implemented uniformly, an analysis of     de facto     control is critical to determining whether respondents are, in fact, subject to governmental control.            3     See ``PRC Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' in Foreign Broadcast Information Service-China-93-133 (July 14, 1993) and 1992 Central Intelligence Agency Report to the Joint Economic Committee, Hearings on Global Economic and Technological Change: Former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and China, Pt. 2 (102 Cong., 2d Sess)         De Factor Control Analysis        We analyze below the issue of     de factor     control based on the criteria set forth in     Silicon Carbide.            ZMEC        In the course of verification, we confirmed that ZEMC's export prices are neither set by, nor subject to approval, by any government authority. This point was supported by ZMEC's sales documentation and company correspondence. We also confirmed, based on examination of documents related to sales negotiations, written agreements and other correspondence, that ZMEC has the authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements independent of government authority. We further found that ZMEC retained proceeds from its export sales and made independent decisions regarding disposition of profits and financing of losses. ZMEC's financial and accounting records as well as joint venture and purchase contracts supported this conclusion. Finally, we have determined that ZMEC has autonomy from the central government in making decisions regarding the selection of management. Although ZMEC's appointment of management is acknowledged by the Zhejiang Machinery Bureau (ZMB), we have concluded that this does not constitute control by ZMB. Based on our examination of minutes of management nomination meetings, appointment announcements and correspondence between ZMEC and ZMB, verification established that the ZMB's involvement in ZMEC's management appointment process reflects nothing more than an administrative formality 4 . Furthermore, based on examination of correspondence files, we found no evidence of involvement by Zhejiang Commission of foreign and Economic cooperation (ZCOFTEC), or any other government authority, in any aspect of ZMEC's operations. For these reasons, we have determined that ZMEC is not subject to     de facto     control by governmental authorities.          4     As we confirmed at verification, the ZMB simply maintains communication with all companies in the machinery industry in the Zhejiang Province and provides general news, trade and statistical services for all companies in this industry.

0,FT942-16637 ,"FT942-16637 _AN-EDHDEAGXFT 940408   FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (7): Emphasis on management - The seven ages of paint production / Fortunately for the coatings industry, management skills have been well applied in the past couple of decades      By JOHN ASHER   Most of today's coatings technologies were conceived by the 1960s, before environmentalism was even a twinkle in Californian eyes. Plastics were being powdered and fused to metal. Laboratories were finding out the mechanisms by which some liquids could be solidified with ultraviolet light. Life in the coatings industry flowed on tranquilly, with all the excitement of watching paint dry. Then marketing burst in on the scene. By the mid-1960s, the DIY industry was blossoming, and one of the largest single drivers was the multi-million marketing spend of large paint companies - with Hadrian, Valspar and Magicote setting the pace for Dulux and Crown to match. Industrial paints remained aloof from these antics, considering a half-crown slipped into the lid of each tin for the paint shop foreman to be a more appropriate purchasing inducement. Indeed, so successful was this approach that some foremen were known to pour fresh paint down the drain to keep up the supply of half crowns] The industry's complacency was rudely shaken by the oil crisis in 1973. Solvents quadrupled in price. Paint companies scurried to reduce solvent usage. Around this time, industrial coatings users were trying to raise productivity in paint shops. Previously, the painting process had been the Cinderella department of many factories, but the combination of rising oil prices and rising paint shop productivity gave a real impetus to new industrial technologies. By contrast, decorative producers' concern about solvent costs was not enough to force radical technical change, but by the mid-1970s it was dawning on producers that California's quest for cleaner air was more than just an aberration among people who had spent too much time in the sun. Stricter environmental regulations were set to become a fact of life for the paintmaker. Gradually, coatings companies caught up with the spirit of the times, and this became the age of divorce. Twenty years previously, paints were more or less similar products across the decorative/industrial spectrum. But by the 1980s the strategic drivers of industrial and decorative paints businesses had become completely different. Decorative paints, both for trade and DIY use, became driven by the needs and demands of their distribution channels. With limited product differentiation, brands which had weathered 50 summers were easily peeled from the shelves of the DIY sheds if they failed to live up to their distributors' expectations. Industrial markets were differently driven. Users of coatings were globalising, and industrial coatings managers had to become international managers. Backing the winning hand of new technologies became critical for each market, so technical competence was crucial. Environmental issues became fundamental drivers of industrial coatings strategy, while remaining marginal issues for decorative businesses. As management processes and philosophy diverged, the divorce between industrial from decorative businesses was the only answer, even if both parties sometimes chose to continue living under the same corporate roof. Businesses with less than critical mass in both decorative and industrial areas got rid of the weaker partner, or they were acquired by a stronger company who did it for them. Environmental pressures were now affecting the shape of the industry. The number of companies supplying the retail market dropped as a result of the decorative shake-out, but the stronger industrial coatings companies still clung on to most of their historical markets. For example, since most industrial coatings companies supplied coatings for metal, and since powder coatings were taking a steadily increasing share of that sector, the companies which had supplied liquid coatings nearly all invested in powder. At one stage there were more than 18 UK companies making powder coatings, most with a far smaller share than the harsh economic realities of the business would allow. A third was all that was needed for both efficiency of scale and competition. This is the number of significant powder coatings producers the UK now has. As these rationalisations have peaked, the past few years have marked the age of portfolio restructuring. Decorative businesses have been regionalising whilst industrial businesses have sought to focus and globalise. With the exception of some speciality finishes, particularly wood finishes, truly international retail brands are still thin on the ground. 'Own-label' manufacturers such as Kalon are regionalising in Europe to exploit their transferable operational skills and build the economies of scale which are vital to them. Environmental pressures on decorative architectural coatings are growing but are still an insignificant driver of strategy compared with distribution channels or manufacturing economies of scale. The do-it-yourself paint consumer continues to buy on the basis of price, colour and finish from any brand, or own-label brand, perceived to have a good reputation. Environmental considerations are well down the list of purchasing determinants. Industrial users now, by contrast, are increasingly constrained by environmental regulations: coatings and coating procedures with lower environmental impact have become crucial in every sector. Since no industrial coatings company can now keep up the pace in all their historical markets whilst trying to globalise and master all the technologies required, portfolio changes have recently been as frequent as car boot sales. They have radically affected nearly all industrial coatings suppliers as they seek to build competitive positions. Today's important question is: 'What is the seventh age, and what will happen in the next decade?' Portfolio restructuring will continue, but at a slower pace in some sectors at least because the number of competitive coatings suppliers is approaching the minimum that the market will tolerate to retain competitive supplies. Aerospace manufacturers now really only have a choice of two coatings suppliers while automotive manufacturers have a choice of four or five. This will be the time to digest what companies may have rather hurriedly swallowed during the past few years. It will be the age of management. Fortunately, management is something the coatings industry has become rather good at over the past couple of decades. Coatings businesses which are subsidiaries of heavy chemical majors, rightly supply more than their fair share of managers, culture and ideas to their institutionalised parents. Managers with a coatings background, even those with quite a modest area of responsibility, have had to develop good strategic understanding, high customer care skills, long term customer-supplier relationships, high quality products efficiently produced - all the ingredients of successful modern business. Often they interface with state-of-the-art customers in their daily work and some of the best industrial strategy and practice rubs off in the process. Environmental pressures may have pointed the direction for the industry. That it has arrived safely is because its management has grown with the challenges and thrived on strong and fruitful links with its customers. This should be a formula for success, in any age.

Industrial giants and government ministries have relied on  environmental consultants to gather information that will answer  vexing questions on the state of the Czech environment. Some of  these companies appear on THE PRAGUE POST list of largest  environmental consulting firms.    ""The government is still debating the laws it passed in  1992,"" said Roman Vyhnanek, director of Czech Environment  Management Center. ""The problem is they don't want to talk to  industries.""    The Ministry of Environment is in the process of defining  and  creating new environmental laws, but companies complain that  current requirements are stiff and impose a financial burden  they cannot afford if they are to remain competitive.    One step in the privatization process for companies is to  outline methods of waste management that are in compliance with  the Environment Ministry's standards. Current pollution  reduction in Czech cities is directly related to these recently  privatized companies, according to Minister Frantisek Benda.    Industry watchers, however, said that the slowdown in  industrial production in the last several years is the primary  cause of the slightly cleaner air.    Consultants and government officials agree that air  pollution  in the cities is the most dangerous short-term environmental  hazard the country faces. And the brown coal mined in northwest  Bohemia is one of the most serious pollutants.    ""The greatest problem is that almost every large power plant  in the Czech Republic burns tons and tons of coal,"" said Jiri  Herstus, director of Aplikovana geotechnika a ekologie (AGE).  ""With the use of desulfurization stations, pollution wouldn't be  nearly as bad.""    AGE, like many environmental consulting firms, works  primarily in the mining industry, assessing the impact of coal  mining on groundwater, air and soil. Herstus said CEZ, the  national energy company, is looking for alternatives to mining,  but meanwhile much land is being spoiled.    Even though the problem is well-defined, solutions remain  elusive.    The current Czech government must reach deep into its  coffers  to find the cash to pay for four decades of neglect. In its 1994  budget, the government allocated 1.2 billion Kc ($41.4 million),  about 3 percent of the overall budget, for environmental  projects. Cleaning up the Czech environment will cost much more  than that.    ""There are still big holes in the environmental solution,""  said Herstus.    Communists chose factory locations for their accessibility  to  raw materials, without regard to effects on local environments.  Industrial waste contaminated rivers and groundwater, polluted  the air and fouled the land. Environmental laws existed under  the former regime, but fines were minimal and violations were  often overlooked.    Consultants on this week's list work primarily with giant  industrial companies, such as CEZ and the automaker Skoda, or  with departments within the government. These large  organizations have the funds to implement cleaner operations;  and, in many cases, the larger firms are the worst environmental  offenders.    Much consulting work is in the form of surveys and  fact-finding efforts, since there is little reliable information  on the Czech environment. Once a body of research has been built  up, the government will be able to assess better the magnitude  of the problem.    Municipalities and factories hire companies to explain the  current environmental laws and suggest ways to remain within  governmental standards while maximizing output. Consultants must  stay atop all environmental legislation because clients'  concerns run the gamut--waste management, groundwater  contamination, soil contamination, air pollution and overall  environmental impact.    Environmental laws today differ from their communist  predecessors ""because before there were laws but no governmental  agency to enforce them,"" said Denisa Kratochvilova, a consultant  with KZT. ""Now we have the Czech Environmental Inspection  Agency.""    Kratochvilova added that it is natural for companies to  change only when threatened with substantial fines from the  government. The trick is to sway companies to comply with the  environmental laws without breaking their backs.     "
0, FR940505-1-00098   FR940505-1-00012                c. Industrial and Commercial Solvents and Coatings," FR940505-1-00098   FR940505-1-00012                c. Industrial and Commercial Solvents and Coatings_     (1) Source category description. The industrial and commercial solvents and coatings source category includes emissions from dry cleaners; degreasing operations; and all types of coating and/or solvent clean-up operations. Examples of coating operations include, but are not limited to: aerospace component coating; automobile and light-duty truck assembly-line coating; can and coil coating; paper, film, and fabric coating; flatwood products coating; large appliance coating; magnet wire coating; marine vessel coating; metal and wood furniture coating; miscellaneous metal parts and products coating; motor vehicle and mobile equipment refinishing; plastic parts coating; and graphic arts (printing) operations.     While EPA has proposed an exemption level similar to that found in the traditional regulations for this source category, EPA seeks public comment on the exemption level found in the rules and will review this exemption level prior to program implementation.     (2) Issues. The major issue on which EPA seeks comment is whether these emissions should be covered by the cap rule as proposed or by a manufacturers bubble approach (see section (i) for discussion). The FIP cap rule approach would provide the owners or operators of facilities using industrial and commercial coatings and solvents the most compliance flexibility. Owners or operators could use a variety of methods to comply with the rule. Such methods include installing new emission control systems or increasing the efficiency of existing control devices, process modifications or substitutions, or limiting the amount of solvent used at the facility. Process modifications including installing new, more efficient processes, increasing the efficiency of existing processes, or limiting process operating time. Substitutions include the replacement of solvent-based coatings with low-VOC coatings.         d. VOC Emissions Associated with the Manufacturing of Products_     (1) Source category description. The rule for this source category will regulate VOC emissions from manufacturing and fabrication processes used to produce organic chemicals, gases, rubber and miscellaneous plastic products. Examples of products manufactured or fabricated by processes that would potentially be covered by this rule are:     Industrial organic chemicals and gases. Industrial organic chemicals include, but are not limited to, gum and wood chemicals, cyclic organic crudes and intermediates, organic dyes and pigments, and 280 organic chemicals (listed in the TSD).     Drugs which include, but are not limited to, medicinal chemicals and botanical products, pharmaceutical preparations, in vitro and in vivo diagnostic substances, and biological products.     Soaps; detergents; cleaning, polishing, and sanitizing preparations; surface active agents, finishing agents, sulfonated oils, and assistants; and perfumes and cosmetics.     Food additives and sweeteners.     Paints, varnishes, lacquers, enamels, inks, primers, paint removers, thinners, stains, shellacs, cleaners, putty, coatings, adhesives, fillers, sealants, explosives, and carbon black.     Fabricated rubber and miscellaneous plastics products including, but not limited to, tires and inner tubes; rubber and plastic footwear, hose, belting, gasket, packing, and sealing devices; and molded, extruded, and lathe-cut mechanical rubber goods.     The proposed rule for this source category contains an exemption level of 10 pounds per day of VOC emissions. While EPA has proposed an exemption level similar to that found in the traditional regulations for this source category, EPA seeks public comment on the exemption level found in the rules and will review this exemption level prior to program implementation.     e. Disposal of Materials Containing VOCs     (1) Source category description. The proposed rule for this source category would regulate VOC emissions at organic waste disposal facilities. Organic waste disposal facilities include any facility which is operated as a business or owned by a state or municipality and is used to treat, store, or dispose of organic wastes that contain VOCs or to reclaim or recycle organic compounds or gases from organic wastes that contain VOCs. Examples of organic waste disposal facility include: landfills; publicly owned treatment works (POTWs); hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities; and sewage sludge, solid waste, and hazardous waste incinerators. Waste solvents, coatings, and other products which contain VOCs are the major source of VOC emissions at these facilities. The VOCs contained in consumer products which are flushed to POTWs after use may be a major source of VOCs at POTWs. Given the limited data available on emissions from these facilities, no exemption level is included in the proposed rule. Upon receipt of baseline data in 1999, EPA will evaluate an exemption level for this source category.     (2) Issues. EPA is requesting any information which can be used to characterize the number, size, and location of, and VOC emissions from organic waste disposal facilities located in the FIP areas. EPA is also requesting public comment on the need for this rule because the reductions associated with the industrial and commercial solvent use and the consumer and pesticide products rules may result in a reduction in VOC emissions at organic waste disposal facilities.         f. Commercial Food Preparation and/or Baking_    (1) Source category description. The proposed rule for this source category will regulate VOC emissions from commercial food preparation facilities. Commercial food preparation facilities include commercial bakeries and commercial charbroiling, fruit and vegetable preservation, grain mill production, malt beverage production, vegetable oil production, and wine- or brandy-making facilities, and restaurants involved in any of the aforementioned activities. The rule for this source category includes an exemption level of 10 pounds per day of VOC emissions. While EPA has proposed an exemption level similar to that found in the traditional regulations for this source category, EPA seeks public comment on the exemption level found in the rules and will review this exemption level prior to program implementation.     (2) Issues. EPA is requesting public comment on methods for adjusting requirements for sources which barely exceed the exemption levels. For these small sources, it will become increasingly onerous to reduce emission levels. EPA is considering implementing the initial emission reduction requirements at a later date (though within a timeframe consistent with the attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the FIP areas) for these sources.         g. Petroleum and Natural Gas Extraction, Processing, and Storage_    (1)  Source category description. The proposed rule for this source category would regulate VOC emissions from all VOC sources at oil and natural gas drilling wells (both on-shore wells and wells located offshore that, by virtue of the rule for onshore wells, would then be regulated by EPA's Outer Continental Shelf regulations in 40 CFR part 55); oil refineries; and petroleum, gasoline, and natural gas storage facilities. Storage facilities include extraction and refinery facilities, bulk gasoline plants and terminals, or any other facility which distributes petroleum, gasoline, or natural gas to retail outlet and wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities.     The intent of this proposed rule is to reduce VOC emissions associated with petroleum and natural gas production, processing, and storage without limiting gasoline supplies. Retail gasoline service stations are exempted from this rule because these facilities already are complying with existing regulations. 68           68     Service stations will be further regulated through category specific regulations proposed elsewhere in this notice.         (2) Issues. EPA is undecided on whether wholesale purchasers/consumers should be subject to the VOC limitations of this rule. A wholesale purchaser/consumer includes any business which is the ultimate consumer of natural gas, gasoline, or other petroleum-based fuel. Examples of wholesale purchaser/consumers include airports and fleet vehicle operations. Public comment is requested on potential control methods for wholesale purchasers/consumers (other than restricting the amount of petroleum, natural gas, or gasoline purchased) which could be applied under the rule.

Because of their failure to adequately control for these confounding factors, these studies lack credibility in assessing the relationship of herbicide exposure to these conditions.

While this suggests such an association, the evidence is inconclusive and its credibility is questionable because an abnormal glucose tolerance test is not an absolute indicator of diabetes and none of these studies allowed for the confounding role of obesity. Two other studies found no association (Moses M., Lilis R., Crow K.D., Thornton J., Fischbein A., Anderson H.A., Selikoff I.J., 1984.

On January 10, 1993, Yazminnie Vazquez, Director, Voluntary Program, Puerto Rico submitted a plan change supplement concerning Puerto Rico's Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP). The Puerto Rico program also was found to be generally identical to the Federal VPP with the exception of changes to reflect different structure and exclusion of the Demonstration Program.         C.

Absence of De Jure Control         The respondents in this investigation have submitted a number of documents to demonstrate absence of     de jure     control. These are the ``Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (    1988 Law    ) and ``Regulations for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved on August 23, 1992 (    1992 Regulations    ), both of which indicate that the responsibility for managing enterprises ``owned by all of the people'' is with the enterprises themselves and not with the government. They have also submitted the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,'' approved on December 21, 1992 (    Export Provisions    ).     The     1988 Law     and     1992 Regulations     shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The     1988 Law     provides that enterprises owned ``by the whole people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers, and purchase their own goods and materials. The     1988 Law     also has other provisions which support a finding that enterprises have management independence from the government. The     1992 Regulations     provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make their own production decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits (Article II); sell their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions (Article XIII); dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire their employees without government approval (Article XVII).     The     Export Provisions     list those products subject to direct government control. While furfuryl alcohol is included on the list of commodities that are subject to export quotas, the quotas are confined to exports to the countries of the European Community and Japan and are not applicable to PRC exports to the United States. There is no indication that the export prices to the United States of furfuryl alcohol are subject to governmental control.     The existence of these enactments indicates that Qingdao IE and Sinochem Shandong IE are not     de jure     subject to governmental control. However, there is some evidence that the provisions of the above-cited laws and regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see ``PRC Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,''     in Foreign Broadcast Information Service-China-93133     (July 14, 1993)).

Absence of De Facto Control         The Department typically considers four factors in evaluating whether each respondent is subject to     de facto     governmental control of its export functions: (1) whether the export prices are set by or subject to the approval of a governmental authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements; (3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management; and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding disposition of profits or financing of losses (    see Silicon Carbide    ).     Qingdao IE and Sinochem Shandong IE each has asserted that (1) it establishes its own export prices; (2) it negotiates contracts without guidance from any governmental entities or organizations; (3) its management operates with a high degree of autonomy and there is no information on the record that suggests central government control over selection of management; and (4) it retains the proceeds of its export sales, and has the authority to sell its assets and to obtain loans. In addition, questionnaire responses indicating that company-specific pricing during the POI does not suggest any coordination among exporters (    i.e.    , the prices for comparable products differ among companies). This information supports a preliminary finding that there is a     de facto     absence of governmental control of export functions.     Consequently, Qingdao IE and Sinochem Shandong IE have preliminarily met the criteria for the application of separate rates. We will examine this issue in detail at verification and determine whether the questionnaire responses are supported by verifiable documentation.

(Hsu Ta-chun), 23, received  the sentence after being convicted of air piracy. He was a  salesman of the mainland's state-run China National Light  Industrial Products Import and Export Corporation in the  northeastern Chinese city of Harbin.    Hsu used a fake bomb to hijack a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737  to Taiwan on 12 December last year and asked for political  asylum. None of the 92 passengers and crew on board were hurt.    Hsu is among 12 asylum seekers who have hijacked 11 mainland  airliners to Taiwan since last April. Ten have been sentenced  to up to 30 years in jail while the rest are waiting trial.    Taipei has so far rejected Peking's demand that hijackers be  repatriated for trial on the mainland, citing judicial  sovereignty over the criminals. But Taipei, trying to deter  further hijacks, said hijackers will be heavily punished and  deported after serving their terms.     "

Morgan has taken a minority stake in a recently formed Indian fund management venture, signalling its intention to gain a greater presence in the country's fast-growing capital markets. The US bank has acquired a 40 per cent interest in the investment management arm of Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, a privately owned development bank. The fund management company was set up last year following deregulation of the Indian mutual fund industry to allow private-sector companies to compete for investments. The joint venture company will initially sell mutual funds (or unit trusts) to individual investors in India, although investment in the funds will also be open to non-resident Indians and foreign institutions who are registered with the local authorities. Morgan said that this represented the first step in a long-term strategy to become a strong domestic money manager in India.

While the move does not mean BHP has decided to go ahead with the project, it does indicate that final feasibility studies are in progress. BHP stressed that board approval for the plant, negotiation of 'satisfactory' natural gas supply and price arrangements, and 'successful completion of definitive engineering and economic feasibility studies' were still required. But if these conditions were met, construction of the plant near Port Hedland, about 1,200km north of Perth, could start in the middle of next year and be completed by 1997. Capacity would be around 2m tonnes a year of hot briquetted iron (HBI). The DRI process involves the reduction of high grade iron ore concentrate using natural gas. The iron produced is made into small briquettes, which can be fed directly into the new generation of mini-mills.   Companies:-  Broken Hill Proprietary.   Countries:-  AUZ  Australia.

The group benefited from rationalisation and lower interest rates. The first quarter usually provides most of the year's earnings because of high industrial, commercial and consumer demand in the severest months of winter. But Hydro-Quebec forecasts confidently it will earn at least CDollars 760m for the full year, well up from 1992, despite the slow recovery. The utility is 100 per cent owned by the Quebec government. Last year's heavy rainfall refilled reservoirs after two lean years, so that in the first quarter it was not forced to buy higher-cost power from New Brunswick and Ontario to meet peak demand. Industrial demand was strong, particularly from smelting and pulp and paper, where operating rates were high. Exports of power to the US were up slightly, while operating expenses overall fell 5.2 per cent. The 1993 investment programme totals CDollars 4.4bn.   Companies:-  Hydro-Quebec.

0,FT923-554 ,"FT923-554 _AN-CI1B0AAPFT 920928   FT  28 SEP 92 / The birth pangs of a capitalist eastern Europe      By MARTIN WOLF   THERE ARE, it has been said, lies, damned lies and statistics. Whether this aspersion on the world's statistical organisations is justified, it is certainly justified of the statistics produced by the late communist regimes of eastern and central Europe. To these regimes statistics were instruments of control and propaganda. As with the economies they purported to measure, the legacy of that unhappy past lingers into a difficult present. Nevertheless, statistics are needed, warts and all, because eastern Europe is a region with a significant economic potential that is undergoing an unparalleled transformation. This week's International Economic Indicators do, therefore, contain the first in a quarterly series on central and eastern Europe, derived from the Eastern European Statistical Bulletin published by Business Strategies. What these statistics describe is the fate of the old socialist industrial economies. These have collapsed. Industrial output in Poland, for example, fell by 45 per cent between early 1989 and mid-1991, as is shown in the chart. The declines measured for Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, though smaller than for Poland, were still huge by any normal standards. Equally evident is the appearance of open inflation. Poland's price level has risen no less than forty-fold since early 1989. Nevertheless, Poland has halted its hyperinflation, while the CSFR and Hungary have done better still. In the latter two countries the inflation has been more a one-off adjustment revealing hitherto concealed inflationary pressures than an ongoing inflationary process of the kind that beset Poland. Meanwhile, Bulgaria and Romania are both still in the grip of soaring prices. What such figures reveal is suggestive. What they conceal is vital. They conceal, for example, the fact most goods were unavailable at their notional prices before liberalisation, at least without queueing for hours. Similarly, the rise in unemployment shown in the table hides the fact that many workers, though supposedly 'employed', were actually idle. The data are obtained through three main channels. The first is the national state statistical offices, which were originally an integral part of the centrally planned economies. These offices were closely associated with the old bureaucracy and its network of controls. The second channel is the central bank of each country, the source of much financial information. The third is international financial institutions, such as the IMF, the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Each of these sources has its particular advantages and disadvantages. But the most important difficulties lie with the official statistical offices on which everyone must ultimately rely. Three big problems arise. First, national accounts were historically based on the concept of net material product (NMP), which excludes most of the service sector of these economies. The GDP estimates now provided do not yet conform to western systems of national accounts, though efforts are being made in this direction. Second, many indicators are distorted by the use of artificial exchange rates. Third and perhaps most important, the burgeoning private sector is still not included in national accounts. Despite these difficulties, it has been decided to present figures based on the official sources rather than make what would inevitably be arbitrary adjustments. In time, the data will get better. But they will probably get better as slowly as the economies, which - at least in the cases of Poland and the CSFR - are now showing some modest signs of recovery. Yet these recoveries are vulnerable, as much to political as economic events. Just how vulnerable is revealed by the table's division of the CSFR into what are soon expected to be the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, this division being certain to damage the initial economic prospects of both, but particularly of Slovakia.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- This table presents the major economic statistics currently published on six east European countries.

0,FT931-245 ,"FT931-245 _AN-DC4CXABUFT 930331   FT  31 MAR 93 / Office block built to be destroyed     By ANDREW TAYLOR   AN eight-storey office block is being built in a former airship hangar at Cardington, Bedfordshire. When complete it will be set on fire, vibrated until it starts to collapse and blown up in one of the world's largest construction research projects, being carried out by the British Building Research Establishment, Andrew Taylor writes. The hangar is one of the world's biggest single enclosed spaces. It once housed the R100 airship and its neighbour contained the ill-fated R101. It could house the Statue of Liberty, Nelson's Column and the Leaning Tower of Pisa and still have room for a couple of jumbo jets. The building will cost Pounds 1.25m, of which the government is providing Pounds 1m. Private companies seeking to test their products and building techniques are providing some labour and materials. Private institutions from other countries wanting to conduct tests will be expected to pay rent for the space they occupy in the building while research is carried out.

ACTION:     Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Partial Termination.                 SUMMARY:     In response to a request by a petitioner and a respondent, the Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan. The review covers seven firms and the period September 1, 1992, through August 31, 1993. The review indicates the existence of margins for the firms.         As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between United States price and foreign market value.   Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.              EFFECTIVE DATE:     December 19, 1994.              FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:        Todd Peterson or Thomas Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. 20230; telephone (202) 4824195 or 4823814, respectively.        Background            On September 20, 1991, the Department published the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan. The Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' on September 7, 1993 (58 FR 47116). The petitioner, Consolidated International Automotive, Inc. (Consolidated), and a respondent, Gourmet Equipment (Taiwan) Corporation (Gourmet), requested that we conduct an administrative review for the period September 1, 1992, through August 31, 1993. We published a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'' on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53710), for the following firms: Buxton International, Gourmet, Chu Fong Metallic Industrial Corporation (Chu Fong), San Chien Electric Industrial Works, Ltd. (San Chien), Everspring Plastic Corp. (Everspring), Kuang Hong Industries Co., Ltd. (Kuang), and Transcend International Co. (Transcend). Questionnaires were sent to Buxton, Everspring, Kuang, Transcend, Gourmet, Chu Fong, and San Chien. Everspring responded that it has never sold the subject merchandise. Only Gourmet and Buxton responded to the questionnaire.     The Department has now conducted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).         Scope of the Review         The merchandise covered by this review is one-piece and two-piece chrome-plated lug nuts, finished or unfinished, which are more than 11/16 inches (17.45 millimeters) in height and which have a hexagonal (hex) size of at least 3/4 inches (19.05 millimeters). The term ``unfinished'' refers to unplated and/or unassembled chrome-plated lug nuts. The subject merchandise is used for securing wheels to cars, vans, trucks, utility vehicles, and trailers. Zinc-plated lug nuts, finished or unfinished, and stainless-steel capped lug nuts are not in the scope of this review. Chrome-plated lock nuts are also not in the scope of this review.     During the period of review (POR), chrome-plated lug nuts were provided for under subheading 7318.16.00.10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this review is dispositive.        Use of Best Information Available (BIA)        In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations provide that the Department may take into account whether a party refuses to provide requested information (19 CFR 353.37(b)). Thus, the Department determines, on a case-by-case basis, what constitutes BIA. For the purposes of these preliminary results, we applied the following two-tier BIA analysis where we were unable to use a company's response for purposes of determining a dumping margin (    see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative review of Antifriction Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, et al.,     58 FR 39739, July 26, 1993):             1. When a company refuses to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impedes these proceedings, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest of the rates found for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin in the less than fair value investigation (LTFV) or prior administrative reviews; or (2) the highest rate found in this review for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin.

Forty years after the disease myxomatosis almost rid the world's driest  continent of the imported pest, the rabbit population is back in plague  proportions and growing by the second.    Farmers fear that the Southern Hemisphere summer just beginning will bring  disaster on the scale of the 1940s, when rabbits regularly ate their way  through the nation's crops.    Estimates of the rabbit population start at about 200 million, the last  official estimate in 1988, and spiral toward 1 billion.    Farmers in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia say the threat posed  by rabbits is the worst in a generation. One farmer hired professionals who  shot 60,000 rabbits in one month on his 41,000-acre property in the west of New  South Wales.    ""They've done more damage than any other single thing in Australia's history,  and they now have a population to do it all over again,"" said Howard Moxham of  the New South Wales Farmers' Assn.    Three years of unseasonally heavy rainfall have increased grass and plant  growth on marginal land, allowing the rabbit's fabled breeding capabilities to  run rampant.    ""Rabbits present the worst threat to the environment New South Wales has faced  in 40 years,"" said farmer Dick Palmer.    ""The impact of rabbits is one of complete devastation. They breed and breed . .  . and eat everything in their path.""    Wild rabbits were introduced to Australia when a farmer in Victoria named  Thomas Austin set free 13 of 24 rabbits sent over from Britain to breed for  sport.    ""The portents are very worrying,"" said Brian Cooke of South Australia's Animal  and Pest Control Commission.    ""Normally rabbits breed for three to four months, but that's been extended to  eight or nine in each of the past three years because of good rains.""    A female rabbit can breed every month of the breeding season. Assuming a  five-month season, in theory it is possible for a single pair of rabbits to  have produced more than 62,000 descendants by the end of three seasons.    While wet weather is the main culprit, the decreasing effectiveness of  myxomatosis, an infectious viral disease, in reducing the population is adding  to the current problems.    Scientists estimate the mortality rate of infected rabbits is now about 60%,  compared to 99% when the virus was introduced in the early 1950s.    The myxomatosis virus, carried by mosquitoes, has also spread less effectively  in the drier ""outback"" areas away from the coast.    Farmers are again looking to science to find a solution to the present plague,  but that will take time.    The government-financed Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research  Organization said it will take at least five years to develop a new genetically  engineered myxomatosis virus, which it hopes will kill rabbits and sterilize  the survivors.    Fleas carrying the virus will be dropped into warrens where, it is hoped, they  will transmit it throughout the colonies. The plan is to make the virus about  60% to 70% effective, so the virus can survive and reinfect successive  generations.    ""It will have a built-in long-term efficiency,"" said a spokesman. ""The rabbits  won't become immune because they will die from something unrelated to the  disease they contract.""    Farmers are pinning their hopes in the near term on viral hemorrhagic disease  (VHD), which is transmitted among rabbits by direct contact, resembles  influenza in its effects and has cut a swathe through Europe's rabbit  population.    Australian authorities are carrying out stringent tests before letting that  virus loose here, but the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research  Organization, which is not involved in VHD's development, does not believe it  is the solution.    ""It won't have the same long-term efficiency because the young will quickly  develop immunity,"" its spokesman said. ""We expect the rabbit population to  bounce back after an initial slump.""    Meanwhile, officials are concentrating on persuading farmers to attack rabbits  with everything they've got. They are also urging environmentalists to take the  problem seriously.    Farmers are being urged to rip out or blow out warrens, and to try poisoning  the rabbits when all else fails.

The report, published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, was based on 30 industrial sectors.

Chen Yuanhu, vice-mayor of the city, noted that the reward  aimed to set up an encouraging mechanism to urge the managers or  directors of state enterprises to strive for better economic  returns.    The prizes ranged from 300,000 to 61,000 yuan.    Chen Zisheng, chairman of the board of directors of  Chongqing  Building Industry Group Corporation, was the top prize winner.    Chen's corporation and Jialing Motorcycle Industrial  Corporation Ltd. are now two of the pillar enterprises in  Chongqing City.    The two civilian-oriented enterprises, which were  transformed  from their military-oriented functions, turned out 1.1 million  motorcycles last year, accounting for 40 percent of those  produced in China.    The prize winners included the general manager of the  Chongqing Automobile Works.

The data will comfort the government as it prepares its 1994-95 budget, due to be announced later this month. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, who launched economic reforms in mid-1991, hopes rising exports will help fuel broad-based growth in the Indian economy. Exports in the year to March 1993 grew by just 3.6 per cent due to a slump in sales to the former Soviet Union and because of unrest following the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque. In early 1993-94 exports recovered sharply although the underlying improvement was exaggerated by the late shipment of orders initially delayed by the riots. More recent figures indicate exports are continuing to grow and suggest the government's pro-export policies are starting to produce results. For the nine months to the end of December, exports rose 19.9 per cent to Dollars 15.7bn - well ahead of the government's target of a 15-16 per cent rise.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

Rhone-Poulenc management has convened a meeting for October 27 at the works council at the group's Pardies acetics plant in south-west France to explain the move. An announcement will be made later that day. The group gave no further details, except to confirm the impending sale was in line with the intention of Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, president, to sell Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn in assets over the next 18 months. These would be chiefly in intermediate or basic chemicals for which his group had no in-house use or where the scale of its activity was dwarfed by that of others. Acetics form part of Rhone-Poulenc's organic and inorganic intermediates division, which last year recorded sales of FFr14.1bn (Dollars 266m).

0,FT933-16325 ,"FT933-16325 _AN-DGECMAABFT 930705   FT  05 JUL 93 / Nadir took up to Pounds 565m from PPI: Little of the money seems likely to be recovered      By ANDREW JACK   MR Asil Nadir misappropriated what could be as much as Pounds 565m from banks, bondholders and shareholders in the last few years of his chairmanship of Polly Peck International to fund a wide range of his personal and business interests. As the battle over the conduct of the case against Mr Nadir continues to rage, a Financial Times investigation has identified how the fugitive businessman removed Pounds 371m from the group in the three years leading up to the Serious Fraud Office raids in 1990. At least another Pounds 194m or more remains unaccounted for and could possibly also have been misappropriated. Mr Nadir jumped bail and fled to northern Cyprus in May. The analysis, based on writs, creditors' reports, company documents and interviews with employees and investigators, shows for the first time the complex movements of funds out of the Nadir business empire into his private activities. Most of the money which was misdirected for Mr Nadir's own purposes came from more than Pounds 1bn raised for PPI in loans, rights issues and bond issues in the UK, Switzerland and other financial centres before his company went into administration in October 1990. Mr Nadir - with the alleged help of a small group of associates in London and northern Cyprus - then switched the money in and out of a number of the group's bank accounts in several countries before using it to: Buy about Pounds 100m of PPI shares through a series of Swiss and Jersey trusts, most of which were not disclosed. Prop up loss-making businesses, principally in Turkey and Cyprus Buy hotels in Cyprus, help purchase two stately homes in England and furnish his properties with valuable antiques. Create a printing and publishing empire in Turkey and Cyprus. All but Pounds 30m of the Pounds 371m has been traced but most appears to have been frittered away. Realisations so far total just over Pounds 1m. Little more is likely to be recovered. The money-go-round began in a series of Polly Peck bank accounts in London, loans to the company and letters of credit. The funds were recorded as transactions in 'inter-company accounts' or loans from the parent PPI group. Between September 1987 and October 1990, Pounds 245m was channelled into northern Cyprus subsidiaries, mostly to Unipac, a packaging company. Another Pounds 126m was booked to Turkish subsidiaries including Meyna, the fruit business. The money passed through several different bank accounts in the names of these subsidiaries, including NatWest in Jersey, a correspondent account with Midland bank in London on behalf of the Industrial Bank of Cyprus, and Impexbank in Turkey. A process of what experts call 'cloaking' then took place, with money switched between accounts, apparently to confuse the trail. Most funds were transferred into the Industrial Bank of Cyprus and Impexbank, both of which were controlled by Mr Nadir during that period. Only at this point was the money - which was still shown in the accounts as borrowings to PPI subsidiaries - misappropriated into activities outside the group such as purchasing PPI shares, propping up loss-making businesses, and purchasing property and antiques. These were never declared in the accounts. It was also during 1987-90 that Mr Nadir made donations to the Conservative party of at least half the Pounds 440,000 the Tories admit getting from the businessman. Substantial contributions also went to charity. A Citibank account in Switzerland in the name of his mother, Mrs Safiye Nadir, emerges as a key conduit for the money. Some was passed on to Corvo, the Jersey trust which funded South Audley Management, the London company which managed some of Mr Nadir's personal interests. Some PPI money to buy shares in the company was channelled through Restro, the Jersey trust. Other money for share purchases went through secret trusts including Riverbridge in Switzerland. About Pounds 85m went to fund Mr Nadir's printing empire in Turkey, including a number of loss-making newspapers he purchased in Turkey such as Gunaydin. He also supported Noble Air, the company, now in liquidation, controlled by his sister. Some Pounds 46m was transferred to the Central Bank of Northern Cyprus. But the bank has refused to co-operate and won on appeal a legal battle that the English courts were not the appropriate jurisdiction in which it could be pursued. Further money was transferred to about 20 offshore bank accounts in the Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and elsewhere. So far only a few millions have been traced. Some realisations will come from sales of the remaining operating businesses, and the administrators also plan to sue Stoy Hayward, PPI's auditor, in the next few months. But creditors are likely to receive only 1p-2p in the pound.

The state-owned company said: 'Like any international company that leads its field, we're looking into new technologies as they progress, but we are not planning a second Thorp plant and not designing anything.' Thorp is designed to operate for at least 25 years but it is based on research done in the 1960s and 1970s. The process of designing, planning, building and commissioning the plant has taken almost 20 years - delayed partly by strong opposition from environmental campaigners. The last move in that opposition takes place at the High Court today when Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, and Lancashire County Council seek a judicial review of the government's decision to allow Thorp to start operating.

Last year saw Fujian's gross social product quadruple,  fulfilling its goal set for the end of this century seven years  ahead of schedule, and its industrial output value rise by 48  percent over the previous year.    According to Yang Mingyi, director of the provincial  Environmental Protection Bureau, the province removed, closed  down or merged 83 industrial enterprises discharging heavy  pollution last year. In addition, it spent more than 50 million  yuan on transforming 265 projects.    The bureau approved the building of more than 100 projects,  which will install pollution-control facilities and release  little pollution upon completion.    To help rural industrial enterprises solve pollution  problems, the Environmental Protection Bureau has set up the  ""Dabao Industrial Pollution Control Center"" in Shishi, a boom  town in southeast Fujian.    The director noted that Fujian will focus on pollution  treatment at 89 key state enterprises and nine units discharging  serious pollution this year, while urging overseas-funded and  rural industrial enterprises to exert more efforts to clean up  pollution.

Because HCFC22 contributes to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional alternative. Regulations regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. HFC125 and HFC143a have very high GWPs, and the GWP of HFC22 is somewhat high. Although HFC143a is flammable, the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable.        (3) CFC11, CFC12, and R502 Industrial Process Refrigeration, New        Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use.        (a) HCFC123._HCFC123 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in new industrial process refrigeration.     Because HCFC123 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative. Since it poses much lower ozone-depleting risk than continued use of CFCs, EPA has determined that its use is acceptable for certain end-uses. In addition, HCFC123's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than almost all other alternatives. HCFC123 is not flammable. EPA strongly recommends that users of HCFC123 adhere to any requirements provided in ASHRAE Standards 15 and 34. Worker-monitoring studies conducted by EPA demonstrate that in office building equipment rooms, HCFC123's 8-hour time-weighted average concentration can be maintained at or under 1 ppm (less than the industry-established AEL of 30 ppm), provided that such standards are followed. HCFC123 is acceptable for use in commercial building chillers and should pose no hazard in industrial uses.        (b) R407A and R407B._R407A and R407B, which consist of HFC134a, HFC32, and HFC125, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in new industrial process refrigeration.     See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration.        (4) CFC13, R13B1, and R503 Industrial Process Refrigeration, Retrofit and New         This type of refrigeration requires temperatures well below those achieved with R502 or HCFC22. A limited number of substitutes have been identified that are capable of meeting technical requirements. These substitutes all contain components with extremely high GWPS, and EPA is concerned about their potential contribution to global warming. However, under SNAP, EPA intends to only find those substitutes unacceptable that clearly present greater overall risk. Given this framework, EPA finds these high-GWP substitutes acceptable. At the same time, EPA strongly urges industry to develop new alternatives for this end-use that do not contain substances with such high GWPs and long lifetimes.        (a) HFC23._HFC23 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC13, R13B1, and R503 in retrofitted and new industrial process refrigeration.     HFC23 has an extremely high 100-year GWP of 9000 relative to CO    2     and a lifetime of 280 years. Its GWP is the highest among the HFCs, and its lifetime is exceeded only by the PFCs. EPA believes HFC23 could contribute significantly to global warming. In addition, the long lifetime of HFC23 means any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible. While the current rule issued under section 608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of HFC23, or leak repair for systems using HFC23, EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary compliance. In particular, EPA urges users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle HFC23 during equipment servicing and upon the retirement of equipment. HFC23 is nonflammable and does not deplete stratospheric ozone.        (b) R403B._R403B, which consists of HCFC22, R218, and propane, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC13, R13B1, and R503 in retrofitted and new industrial process refrigeration.     Because HCFC22 contributes to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional alternative. Regulations regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. R218, or perfluoropropane, is an extremely long-lived substance with an extremely high GWP. EPA believes this blend could contribute significantly to global warming. In addition, the long lifetime of R218 means any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible. R403B is only acceptable as a substitute for this end-use. The GWP of HCFC22 is also somewhat high. Although propane is flammable, the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that the blend's composition never becomes flammable. In a proposed rulemaking soon to be issued, EPA intends to propose R403B unacceptable as a substitute for R502 in all end-uses because other substitutes have been identified which do not exhibit such extreme GWPs or lifetimes.

Chiang said he told his  Egyptian hosts that resuming direct Taiwan-Egypt airlinks and  setting up liaison offices in both countries would effectively  strengthen bilateral ties.    During an April 18 meeting with Chiang, the Egyptian  Industrial and Business Federation said it hoped to attract more  Taiwan tourists to the north African country, the minister said.    The federation also accepted Chiang's invitation to take  part  in the Fourth Republic of China [ROC] import fair scheduled to  open in Taipei in October, Chiang said.    Chiang noted that the Egyptian Government is working to  prevent further decline in its large tourism industry by  improving the commercial and investment climate, liberalizing  currency exchange and cutting inflation.    Before visiting Egypt, Chiang attended a General Agreement  on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ministerial meeting in Morocco.     "
0,FT933-12224 ,"FT933-12224 _AN-DGZB2AAVFT 930726   FT  26 JUL 93 / Banks meet over Ferruzzi debts: Smaller foreign banks nervous about suicide of Gardini      By ROBERT GRAHAM   FOREIGN banks owed L6,500bn (Pounds 2.72bn) in the collapse of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group are due to attend a creditors' meeting in Milan tomorrow under the auspices of the Bank of Italy. The meeting has been called by Mediobanca which is co-ordinating the rescue operation through five Italian and two foreign banks. By holding the session at the Milan offices of the Bank of Italy, Mediobanca has aimed to give a sense of neutrality while also demonstrating the central bank's commitment to the orderly resolution of the problems created by Ferruzzi's L31,000bn consolidated debt. But the meeting has been complicated by the extraordinary string of recent events affecting the leading players in Italy's second largest private group and the state of Ferruzzi-Montedison's finances. As a result, some of the smaller foreign banks may well be tempted to invoke proceedings for default. Until now the two foreign banks on the rescue committee, Switzerland's UBS and France's Societe Generale, have not raised the issue. The foreign banks, however, have been made nervous by the shock-waves following the suicide by Mr Raul Gardini, the former head of the Ferruzzi empire, and by arrest warrants issued for four key figures connected with the group on charges including alleged falsifying accounts and illicit financing of political parties. It is now certain, according to Milan magistrates, that Mr Gardini would have been arrested on similar charges had he not committed suicide. Mr Carlo Sama, married to one of the three sisters of the empire's founder the late Arturo Ferruzzi, and former chief executive of Montedison, the group's chemicals arm, is now in prison on charges of alleged falsifying accounts and corruption. Mr Vittorio Giuliani Ricci, married to another of Arturo Ferruzzi's daughters, and a leading group executive, has been released on bail. The late Mr Gardini's close associate, Mr Sergio Cusani, a financier close to the Socialist Party, was also arrested on corruption charges allegedly related to the creation of a L100bn slush fund resulting from Ferruzzi-Montedison's involvement in the reorganisation of the chemicals industry. Over the weekend Mr Giuseppe Berlini, the Ferruzzi family's private financier, handed himself in to Milan magistrates after an arrest warrant was issued for alleged corruption' These arrests, coupled with the continued interrogation of Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the former chief executive of Montedison, have already begun to shed light on some of the reasons behind Ferruzzi's huge debts and losses. Evidence has emerged that goes some way to explain the mysterious announcement on June 28 that Montedison had lost an extra L320bn in 1992 only days after shareholders had approved the year's accounts. According to extracts of Mr Garofano's testimony due to be published today by Il Mondo, a weekly magazine, these losses relate directly to commodity trading deals conducted by Mr Gardini. To cover commodities trading losses of Dollars 60m-Dollars 80m (Pounds 40m-Pounds 53m), Mr Gardini decided to speculate in soya in 1989. This was already public knowledge since the Chicago Board of Trade subsequently imposed a Dollars 2m fine on the Ferruzzi group. However, according to Mr Garofano's testimony, Mr Gardini lost Dollars 350m-Dollars 400m. Of this only Dollars 150m was written into the accounts of Ferruzzi Finanzaria (Ferfin) in 1990 and the remainder was temporarily covered by Montedison arranging a back-to-back financial operation with Montedison International, allegedly using the services of Mr Berlini. The Garofano testimony goes on to allege that the extra L320bn hole in Montedison's 1992 accounts was due to the Ferruzzi family seeking to cover the bulk of the commodities losses caused by the days of the Gardini chairmanship by attributing them to Montedison.

Biotechnology is also to receive  another G45 million in subsidies from ICES [expansion not given]  funding to improve the knowledge infrastructure.    After three years of negotiations, three ministries, six  universities, NWO and NIABA [Netherlands Industrial and  Agricultural Biotechnology Association] have agreed to set up  and subsidize ABON [Association of Biotechnology Research  Schools in the Netherlands]. During the NBC5 [Fifth Netherlands  Biotechnology Congress], ABON will present an overview of  current and future activities.    The association can count on strong government subsidies.  The five research schools participating in ABON will receive  subsidies of G22 million over five years: G10 million from the  Economic Affairs Ministry, five million guilders from the  Education and Science Ministry, five million guilders from the  NWO and two million guilders from the Agriculture Ministry. The  subsidies will be matched by the participating universities.  The total amount of 44 million guilders will create around 65  full-time research jobs in universities, in DLO [Agricultural  Research Department] and TNO [Netherlands Organization for  Applied Scientific Research].    The investment plan follows the main lines of the project  areas suggested by the NIABA, namely: ""structure function  relations,"" ""research of plant resistance,"" ""metabolic pathway  engineering"" and ""integrated bioprocess development.""    The four areas have been elaborated into a number of themes  which are both scientifically challenging and interesting for  the industry. Each area will have one or two research schools  managing the projects. In turn, each school has appointed a  professor to ""lead"" the projects.    In order to ensure that industry has input into the  activities, ABON will have a ""Scientific and Industrial Advisory  Council"" which will issue binding advice.    Cooperation    The ABON unites five biotechnology research schools:    -- BioCentrum Amsterdam;    -- Biotechnological Sciences Delft Leiden (BSDL);    -- Experimentele Plantwetenschappen (EPW, of Wageningen);    -- Voeding, Levensmiddelen, Agrobiotechnologie en Gezondheid  (VLAG, of Wageningen);    -- Groningen Biomolecular and Biotechnology Institute (GBB).    The BioCentrum Amsterdam will concentrate on fundamental and  applied research. The connecting theme will be the growth and  development of living organisms including yeast and bacteria.    The BSDL will deal with three areas: industrial plant  biotechnology, environmental biotechnology and industrial  biotechnology.    GBB will concentrate on the atomic structure and function of  biomacromolecules.    EPW will gather knowledge on four themes: the development of  plants and differentiation; disease and resistance to disease;  metabolism and energy location in plants; plant biotechnology.    VLAG will cover the entire agricultural area and more  specifically three core themes: nutrition and health; food  technology and food; food resources and agro-biotechnology.    Knowledge Infrastructure    In addition to the ABON, there is more good news for  biotechnology. Last week the cabinet approved two major  biotechnology projects to strengthen the knowledge  infrastructure: biotechnological soil purification will get G25  million, while biotechnology's material infrastructure can  expect G20 million.    Soil Purification    Universities (including Groningen), large technological  institutes, engineering consultants and companies will  participate in the first project covering biotechnological soil  purification. TNO, Grondmechanica Delft and Heidemij have  developed a program for cleaning up polluted business land on  site, called NOBIS [Netherlands research program for  biotechnological on-site cleaning]. The goal is to develop the  biotechnological clean-up of polluted soil using micro-organisms  to break down the pollution.    Material Infrastructure    The second biotechnology project in ICES is called MIBITON.  The cabinet wants it to strengthen the material infrastructure  of biotechnology research in the Netherlands. MIBITON is a  positive reaction by the cabinet to a proposal from ABON and  NIABA. These two bodies have drawn up a joint investment  program for the coming five years which includes a one-time  boost from the government, the G20 million mentioned above.  This amount will be supplemented with industrial resources  worth around G12.5 million in the form of the revolving fund for  industrial investments. In order to effectively monitor these  investments, NIABA and ABON will set up the PPSB foundation  [public-private biotechnology cooperation] in close consultation  with the government.     "

At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20.80 at 3,174.68, above its lows for the session. The more broadly based Standard  Poor's 500, however, firmed 0.30 to 409.67, while the Amex composite ended just 0.54 lower at 365.63 and the Nasdaq composite rose 2.43 to 578.65. Turnover on the NYSE was heavy at 205m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 879 to 805. The Dow's decline was almost entirely due to losses in IBM and Philip Morris, which were hit by poor quarterly results. According to Birinyi Associates, the New York market analysis firm, all but a couple of points of the decline in the Dow was due to the big losses in IBM and Philip Morris, two of the largest constituents of the Dow. Analysts said that the S  P 500 and other secondary indices provided a better measure of market performance, which suggested that despite some bad corporate news the market was relatively stable. The day's economic numbers were not particularly significant. A 16,000 drop in weekly jobless claims and a 0.2 per cent increase in September consumer prices were positive for the market, but were offset by a big fall in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of local business activity and a similar-sized decline in the ABC/Money Magazine index of consumer confidence. IBM dominated trading after the giant computer group reported third quarter net income of 15 cents a share, well below the 75 cents a share forecast by analysts. The news from IBM set off a stampede of selling, which delayed the opening of trading in the stock for more than 30 minutes. After a hectic day's trading, IBM shares eventually closed down Dollars 5 1/8 , or 6.5 per cent, at Dollars 72 7/8 , the stock's lowest close for more than 10 years. Turnover was 6.2m shares. The day's other big story was Philip Morris, which plunged Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 79 3/4 in turnover of 9.5m shares. Although the bottom line numbers from the company were not so bad - a 16.4 per cent increase in after-tax profits to Dollars 1.29bn - investors were disappointed by falling domestic cigarette shipments and warnings from the company of a much larger fall to come in the fourth quarter. AMR, parent group of American Airlines, firmed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 after the company announced plans to cut 1993 spending by Dollars 300m and reduce payroll costs by 10 per cent through management job cuts. Canada TORONTO stocks ended mixed in moderate dealings, held back by a slumping real estate sector. The TSE 300 composite index gained 0.75 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 3,196.14, with declining issues outpacing gainers 297 to 211. Volume was 23m shares valued at CDollars 252.1m against the previous 23.6m valued at CDollars 215.6m.  The Financial Times   London Page 39  "

The company was sold by auction on Monday at the Lima stock exchange. The sole bidder was Mercantile Industrial Inga, which has a long-established trading relationship in zinc metal and concentrates with Minpeco USA. Inga is associated with Ralbir, an investment group with Brazilian and Uruguayan capital. Minpeco USA went for Dollars 4.1m, the rock-bottom price acceptable to the parent company and the precise amount of the debt that it had to clear with its traditionally profitable US subsidiary. Last year Minpeco USA sold about Dollars 400m of minerals and turned in a modest profit of about Dollars 320,000. Mr Peter Warner, spokesman for Inga in Lima, said Minpeco had a 'fine reputation' and there were no plans to change the company name. 'Minpeco's strength is on the west coast of Latin America while ours is on the east coast, so there's a nice fit,' he said.  The Financial Times   London Page 32  "

This also applies to  Austria, whose diligent agents have provided comprehensive  services to NATO's intelligence services from the time of the  signing of the State Treaty in 1955 until today, most recently  during the current crisis in Yugoslavia.    Neutrality did not play any role.    Austria -- Excellent Contacts    The Austrian Army's intelligence service, the Group for  Intelligence Matters, played a significant role in the  intelligence sphere shortly after its founding in 1955/56 during  the Hungarian crisis in 1956.    Western intelligence officials received detailed information  from their Austrian counterparts on the situation in its eastern  neighbor, consisting of reports by informers and recordings of  the radio traffic monitored by the Austrian Army. The good  relationship between the Group for Intelligence Matters and the  Western intelligence services was partly due to the excellent  contacts between its leading officers and Western  organizations, which date back to the last years of Nazi terror.  The first head of the Group for Intelligence Matters, Kurt  Fechner, could look back on a long career in the intelligence  service of the First Republic and in the counterintelligence  service (the military intelligence service) of Hitler's Reich.    When the collapse was already visible, Fechner succeeded in  establishing contact with the French and U.S. intelligence  services. This not only saved him from any kind of persecution  by the occupation forces but, as a result, he also knew a great  number of agents who many years later intervened with the  Austrian authorities to support his nomination as head of the  Austrian intelligence service.    Koenigswarte Listening Post    The establishment of the Austrian intelligence service was  mainly supported by U.S. intelligence, which also provided the  necessary funds -- in the case of the listening post of the  Group for Intelligence Matters. Apart from setting up an  information network in the East Bloc, where the United States  cooperated with Kurt Fechner, the U.S. agents also offered Army  Colonel Rudolf Camerlander and his comrade Johann Zahradnik help  in the establishment of a radio monitoring service.    The officers of the Austrian Army soon set up a group of  motorized radio troops with instruments and vehicles from U.S.  stocks which they headed out from their headquarters in the  barracks in Vienna's third district. A little later, the Group  for Intelligence Matters established (again with U.S. funds and  U.S. know-how) the first fixed listening station at the  so-called Koenigswarte, a few kilometers from the Hungarian  border and Bratislava.    Apart from the building at Koenigswarte, the Austrian  intelligence service expanded the espionage network under U.S.  control. The signal/reconnaissance battalion (known as the  Technical Control Service at the time) was established in  Neulengbach, where the specialists in radio espionage, decoding  specialists, interpreters, and information and evaluation  experts carried out their work.    U.S. Espionage Network    The reason for the CIA's generosity was naturally not  altruism. The monitoring network only worked for Austria to a  limited extent. During the first phase of the Cold War, U.S.  intelligence established a network of listening stations in all  West European countries that bordered on East Bloc states. Thus,  the Austrian listening posts that were in a position to  intercept radio traffic in Yugoslavia, the Balkans, Hungary, the  CSFR, and large parts of the USSR were designed as a support for  the U.S. espionage network.    The Austrian officers had to submit the recordings and  summaries of monitored radio traffic to the headquarters of the  German Intelligence Service in Pullach. There, the material was  picked up by representatives of the CIA. This breach of  neutrality was silently tolerated by the Austrian intelligence  officers.    Electronic Aid From Overseas    In 1963, some intelligence officers spoke up against the  cooperation between neutral Austria and a NATO intelligence  service. Lieutenant Colonel Johann Zahradnik, who headed  Koenigswarte, even went as far as addressing a letter to Defense  Minister Georg Prader and State Secretary Otto Roesch, pointing  out the unilateral cooperation between the Group for  Intelligence Matters and the CIA. The result, however, was that  he was transferred to another position.    Despite the fact that the Austrian Defense Minister took  over  the financing of the monitoring network, the U.S. authorities  were even concerned about the modernization of cruising and  monitoring network of the Intelligence Service of the Austrian  Army [HNA] until the 1990's.    At the Neulengbach computer center, where it was possible  to observe the troop movements of even the smallest units on the  other side of the border, officers and engineers had reached the  limit of what was possible some time ago. The instruments had  to be renewed to improve the processing of the increasing influx  of data. The INA ""passive collection system"" was developed.  However, the Austrian electronic engineers were not in a  position to prepare the required programs.    At this point, the U.S. company Bendix offered to cooperate  with the Austrians. It was no coincidence that Bendix also  cooperated with U.S. intelligence. According to the wishes of  the U.S. Administration, the electronic system was to be  provided to the Austrians free of charge. Yet, because of the  chaos within the Austrian Defense Ministry, the smart Americans  made the Austrians pay a sum for their services that allegedly  exceeded 10 million schillings.    Services for NATO by the Neutral Countries    In the crisis year of 1991, the HNA mobilized its radio post  at the Austrian-Yugoslav border. In cooperation with the  Italian military intelligence service which had infiltrated its  agents into Yugoslavia, the HNA supplied an exact picture of the  political and military situation there.    The cruising and monitoring stations of the Austrian Army  monitored the radio traffic of the Yugoslav People's Army and of  all parties to the civil war. The Austrian reports even  contained exact descriptions of the supply lines and the  positions of the Serbian armed forces heavy weapons.    The results of the espionage activities of the Austrian  intelligence service were passed on to NATO intelligence  services, who examined -- and dropped -- the possibilities of a  military operation to end the conflict in the former Yugoslavia  on the basis of the Austrian data.    However, cooperation between the military intelligence  service of a neutral state and the intelligence services of NATO  member states is not merely an Austrian peculiarity. After  numerous hints regarding a special unit within the military  intelligence service in Switzerland, the Federal Council was  forced to set up a parliamentary investigation committee for the  Military Department (the Swiss Defense Ministry) on 12 March  1990.    The parliamentarians discovered a secret resistance army,  the  P-26, which was established as early as in the 1950's and which  had contacts with similar secret troops in other West European  countries. The special unit was considered the Swiss branch of  the NATO organization ""Gladio,"" which was set up in nearly all  West European states with U.S. support in the 1950's. All in  the government, in the Military Department, and in the  Department of Justice and Police who knew about Gladio pretended  to be ignorant and guiltless after the exposure of the scandal.  The head of the P-26, Efrem Cattelan (codename ""Rico""), went  underground and took along some of the P-26's most important  secrets. Even the government claims not to possess a ""key to  the activation of the deactivation"" of the P-26.    Swedish Services for the CIA    Sweden's image as a model neutral country is also beginning  to show cracks because of the activities of its military  intelligence service. From the memoirs of Swedish Air Force  Officer Stig Wennerstrom, who worked for the USSR's military  intelligence service until 1963, it becomes clear that the  Swedish military cooperated with U.S. intelligence, to whom the  reports by the attaches in the Soviet Union were handed over  voluntarily. Ten years after the Wennerstrom affair, the two  journalists Peter Bratt and Jan Guillou, as well as the former  agent Hakan Isacson uncovered ""criminal practices"" of the  intelligence service of the Swedish Army in the magazine FOLKET  I BILD [PEOPLE IN THE KNOW]. The intelligence service provided  aid to Western intelligence and security services during their  operations in Sweden and its eastern neighboring countries.    Agents of the operational department of the Swedish  intelligence service, the Information Office (to which Olof  Palme, who became prime ministe later, also belonged for a  certain period) planned and carried out landings on the Finnish  coast in cooperation with the CIA. In 1970, they even helped  the Israeli intelligence service break into the embassies of  Egypt, Algeria, and Iraq and protected it against police  investigations. Reports from the East were also passed on to  the Israeli secret service by the Information Office.    The election victory of the conservatives in 1991 in Sweden  did not change anything regarding the military intelligence  service's influential position. Quite the contrary. The change  of governemnt even led to an expansion of the intelligence  service (which is quite large for a neutral state).    Since Sweden has a significant weapons industry, the  military  intelligence service can continue to rely on the government's  approval of its intensive contacts with NATO intelligence  services in the interest of the protection of Swedish interests.

The decision to rescind the closure of five of the 12 fertiliser plants followed a judicial decision on Tuesday that rejected an attempt by the KIO's new management to bring fraud and gross negligence charges against its former senior executives in Spain. Grupo Torras, the KIO's Spanish investment arm which owns Ercros, did not explain its change of mind, but analysts saw it as a response to government pressure and to the growing protests that the cutbacks had provoked. Significantly, the decision to retain all the fertiliser units and to withdraw 1,900 redundancies - half the workforce - was announced by the employment minister to union leaders. The debt-laden fertiliser unit accounted for half of Ecros' losses of Pta16.4bn (Dollars 146.7m) in 1991, three times higher than forecast. Ercros was put into receivership last summer, and Torras had hoped to rescue it through the disposal of Fesa-Enfersa.   Companies:-  Ercros.     Grupo Torras.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.

0,FT931-8119 ,"FT931-8119 _AN-DBUAKADIFT 930220   FT  20 FEB 93 / Markets: Glaxo fights for global crown - The Bottom Line      By PAUL ABRAHAMS   Pity Glaxo. Europe's largest drugs group is vying with Merck of the US to be the world's number one pharmaceuticals group. The company markets Zantac, the world's best-selling drug. Its underlying earnings growth in the six months to the end of December was 13 per cent - a performance that almost all companies during a recession would envy. Glaxo appears to be doing everything right. Yet its shares have fallen from 814p last September to as low as 662p this week. For the most part, the problems faced by Glaxo are those shared by the rest of the pharmaceuticals industry. US investors, noting the pick-up in the American economy, have been dumping defensive drugs stocks capable of generating consistent earnings growth during recession. Instead, they have been plunging into cyclical companies hit by the slow-down but capable of impressive growth during a recovery. The swing against drugs stocks has been exaggerated by fears about the political outlook in the US for pharmaceuticals companies. The Clinton administration has pinpointed healthcare as a key agenda item. Drugs companies, many of which in the past have increased prices well above inflation, are directly in the administration's sights. Dr Ernest Mario, Glaxo's chief executive, admitted this week that the outlook in the US looked extremely uncertain. Everything, he said, remained up in the air. Glaxo is in a better position than many to withstand the Clinton administration. Glaxo has recently limited its US price increases to below the rate of inflation. At constant exchange rates, only 1 percentage point of its sales growth came from price increases compared with 12 percentage points from volume. In addition, the group does not manufacture medicines in Puerto Rico, so it would be less exposed to moves curbing the island's tax haven status. Nevertheless, doubts remain about Glaxo's continued ability to drive double-digit earnings growth. Nearly half of its operating profits growth in the first six months was generated by Zantac, the ulcer treatment. After yesterday's results Goldman Sachs upgraded its 1995 sales forecasts for Zantac to a massive Pounds 2.6bn. However, the better-than-expected growth of Zantac underlines Glaxo's dependence on the drug. Glaxo faces challenges to Zantac's American patents, which protect the drug from generic competition up to 2002. If Glaxo loses, the drug could face such competition by 1996. Zantac faces an earlier threat, too. Its main rival SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet is coming off patent next year. Cost-anxious US healthcare managers may insist doctors prescribe cheap generic versions of Tagamet rather than the more expensive, patented Zantac. Glaxo's double-digit earnings growth is also becoming hindered by the company's very size. If its new drugs turn out to be only moderately successful Glaxo could face difficulties maintaining its growth. Goldman Sachs believes earnings per share growth may slow to under 10 per cent beyond 1995. Glaxo's new drugs, such as its migraine treatment Imigran and its asthma drug Serevent, are still in the balance. They have not yet, or have only just been, launched in the US, Japan, Germany or France. Dr Mario warned, however, that Imigran's growth would not be explosive. Glaxo's shares could be boosted next Friday if a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee review of Serevent is favourable. Also, Dr Mario has calmed immediate fears about a rights issue to fund the acquisition of a big company in the US over-the-counter, non-prescription drug market. The main problem Dr Mario faces is not persuading investors Glaxo is a quality drug stock - it clearly is. Rather, he must convince investors to plunge further into defensive stocks when the US and UK economies appear to be recovering from recession.   Companies:-  Glaxo Holdings.

Operating profit, however, fell to R34.07m from R35.9m a year earlier despite a 6 per cent increase in turnover to R737.4m, reflecting the difficult market conditions. The interim dividend was maintained at 20 cents a share on a 21 per cent improvement in earnings per share to 42.5 cents, from 35.1 cents a year ago. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said an end to inventory corrections by steel stockists and new projects had helped local steel sales increase by nearly 10 per cent over the same period in 1992. Mr Boyd predicted that firmer dollar prices for export steel and ferro-alloy products, and a weaker rand, should allow a 'moderate' increase in second-half earnings over the first six months.

Engineers at the University of the West of England, in Bristol, have cracked the problem of how to grow the chlorella algae cheaply enough to make power generation feasible - filtering them from ponds is uneconomical. They have used a 'Biocoil', a five-metre high vertical tube in which the algae circulates, harnessing sunlight for photosynthesis. Sewage has proven a particularly effective nutrient for the algae. The carbon dioxide produced when the algae are burnt is redirected to help new algae grow, preventing the emission of greenhouse gases. The first power station could be in use within 18 months.

The index was buoyed at the start of the session by buying prompted by the overnight strength in New York. However, index and arbitrage-related selling later depressed the Nikkei. Volume decreased to 220m shares from Tuesday's 250m. Activity thinned out in the middle of the holiday week: Tokyo's financial markets were closed on Wednesday and will be shut next Monday and Tuesday for national holidays. Declines led rises by 576 to 360, with 202 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 1.54 to 1,317.46. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.49 to 1,072.63.

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone retreated Y1,000 to Y635,000 on profit-taking. The stock gained ground on Tuesday on reports that the Ministry of Finance was considering a cut in the issue's minimum trading unit.

The regulation could even go so far as to require the competent person to attend a 2-day training class certified by the National Fire Protection Association. NFPA maintains a list of certified classes.          OSHA agrees that it may appear from the proposal that competent persons are expected to perform some duties equivalent to those of the Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist, or Coast Guard authorized person. This was not the intent. OSHA does not believe, based upon the duties that are expected from a competent person, that it is necessary to specify the competent persons be trained by the NFPA as suggested by Washington State. Rather, OSHA believes the knowledge and training requirements in paragraph (c) are appropriate for the testing that a competent person is allowed to do. However, the competent person needs to be trained to recognize the need for more sophisticated assistance and must know how to call for that assistance. This new requirement makes it clear that competent persons, rather than perform all tests and evaluations alone, must have the ability to determine when the expert assistance of the Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist, or Coast Guard authorized person is needed.   In paragraph (c)(7) OSHA is continuing the requirement found in the second part of paragraph (b)(5) in the previous rule. Paragraph (c)(7) requires that a competent person must have the capability to maintain the records required by the standard. As noted earlier, OSHA has divided the previous requirements of paragraph (b)(5) into two separate paragraphs, (c)(5) and (c)(7). There were no objections to this change as it was proposed in paragraph (b)(6) and (b)(7). Therefore, OSHA considers paragraph (c)(7) to be an editorial change to previous paragraph (b)(5).       Recordkeeping.     OSHA has redesignated the logging of inspections and test requirements as paragraph (d) Recordkeeping. The changes proposed to the requirements of previous paragraph (c) addressing logging of inspections and tests were contained in paragraph (c) of the proposal.   In paragraph (d)(1) OSHA has made substantive changes to the language of previous paragraph (c)(1). OSHA is requiring that the employer ensure that the competent person, Marine Chemist or Certified Industrial Hygienist performing any tests required by Subparts B, C, D, or H of this part, records the test locations, time, date, location of inspected spaces, and the operations performed, as well as the test results and any instructions. OSHA has combined paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of the proposal and eliminated the need for the OSHA 74 form. The new language continues the previous requirement that persons conducting tests and inspections record the results of those tests and inspections. However, it eliminates the mandated use of the OSHA 74 form. OSHA believes that the format or instrument of the test report is not important, so long as the information required by OSHA is contained in the record.   OSHA received a number of comments urging the Agency to allow other forms of reporting the atmospheric testing results in addition to the OSHA 74 form.   The Navy's Sea Systems Command (Ex. 612) commented that,          [Section] 1915.7(c) requires that all tests be logged on the OSHA Form 74. Recommend insertion of the words ``or equivalent'' to allow for use of locally developed (e.g. computer-generated) forms which include at least all of the information required by the OSHA Form 74.          Marine Hydraulics International (Ex. 621), Colonna's Shipyard (Ex. 622), S.T.A.S. (Ex. 637) and Moon Engineering (Ex. 638) agreed and submitted identical comments that stated:          We suggest that the following words be added to the end of this paragraph: ``or equivalent.'' The OSHA 74 does not possess room for additional instructions to workers, and by allowing the use of an equivalent form, workers could be informed of other requirements that the Shipyard Competent Person may invoke.          In previous paragraph (c)(1), competent persons were required to make a record of the locations, operations performed and the date, time, and results of any test they performed on a ``Log of Inspections and Tests by Competent Person'' (OSHA 74 form). Competent persons were also required under previous paragraph (c)(1) to use a separate form for each vessel on which tests and inspections were made. By allowing the use of alternative forms to record atmospheric test results, the employer will have more flexibility in complying. However, employees will be protected and OSHA will be aided in its enforcement by the fact that employers will still be required to maintain records of tests and inspections.   In paragraph (d)(2) of the final rule, OSHA continues the maintenance of records requirement of previous paragraph (c)(2). OSHA is requiring the employer to ensure that records created to comply with the recordkeeping requirements of this section are posted in the immediate vicinity of the affected operations while work is progress and for a period of at least three months from the completion date of the specific job for which they were generated. OSHA considers the new language to be a non-substantive change.   In paragraph (d)(3) of the final rule, OSHA continues the availability of records requirement of previous paragraph (c)(2). Paragraph (d)(2) requires the employer to ensure that the records required in this section are available for inspection by the Assistant Secretary, Director, employees, or their representatives while work in the affected spaces is in progress. The new language contains editorial corrections for clarity and consistency with other OSHA record inspection requirements. OSHA considers the changes to this paragraph to be non-substantive.       C. Subpart B, Sections 1915.11 through 1915.16       1. 1915.11 Scope and Application       The scope contained in previous 1915.11 applies the requirements in Subpart B to vessels and vessel sections found in shipyards during ship repair and ship breaking; 1915.16 applies to ship repair only. On November 29, 1988, OSHA proposed to amend its shipyard standards addressing safe entry into and work within spaces containing explosive and other dangerous atmospheres on board vessels and vessel sections in shipyards (53 FR 48092). Under this proposal, OSHA would have applied Subpart B to all types of shipyard work on vessels and vessel sections, including ship building, ship repair, and shipbreaking. The Agency proposed extending the scope of Subpart B in this manner to protect employees entering and working in explosive and other dangerous atmospheres, regardless of the type of work they were performing.   Subsequently, after the closing date for comments on this proposed shipyard rule, OSHA also proposed new rules for confined spaces in general industry (54 FR 24080, June 5, 1989). The general industry proposal would have had the effect of covering land-side (that is, other than shipboard) confined spaces in shipyards, such as piping systems in shops or confined spaces in staging areas.   As noted earlier, SESAC reviewed the general industry proposal and made recommendations regarding its possible application to shipyard work. In June 1992, OSHA reopened the record for Subpart B (57 FR 28172, June 24, 1992), to place the SESAC recommendations in the rulemaking record and to gather additional information on whether or not the proposed general industry confined spaces standard was appropriate for land-side confined spaces entered during shipyard work.

Marine Hydraulics International (Ex. 621), Colonna's Shipyard (Ex. 622), S.T.A.S. (Ex. 637) and Moon Engineering (Ex. 638) agreed and submitted identical comments that stated:          We suggest that the following words be added to the end of this paragraph: ``or equivalent.'' The OSHA 74 does not possess room for additional instructions to workers, and by allowing the use of an equivalent form, workers could be informed of other requirements that the Shipyard Competent Person may invoke.          In previous paragraph (c)(1), competent persons were required to make a record of the locations, operations performed and the date, time, and results of any test they performed on a ``Log of Inspections and Tests by Competent Person'' (OSHA 74 form). Competent persons were also required under previous paragraph (c)(1) to use a separate form for each vessel on which tests and inspections were made. By allowing the use of alternative forms to record atmospheric test results, the employer will have more flexibility in complying. However, employees will be protected and OSHA will be aided in its enforcement by the fact that employers will still be required to maintain records of tests and inspections.   In paragraph (d)(2) of the final rule, OSHA continues the maintenance of records requirement of previous paragraph (c)(2). OSHA is requiring the employer to ensure that records created to comply with the recordkeeping requirements of this section are posted in the immediate vicinity of the affected operations while work is progress and for a period of at least three months from the completion date of the specific job for which they were generated. OSHA considers the new language to be a non-substantive change.   In paragraph (d)(3) of the final rule, OSHA continues the availability of records requirement of previous paragraph (c)(2). Paragraph (d)(2) requires the employer to ensure that the records required in this section are available for inspection by the Assistant Secretary, Director, employees, or their representatives while work in the affected spaces is in progress. The new language contains editorial corrections for clarity and consistency with other OSHA record inspection requirements. OSHA considers the changes to this paragraph to be non-substantive.       C. Subpart B, Sections 1915.11 through 1915.16       1. 1915.11 Scope and Application       The scope contained in previous 1915.11 applies the requirements in Subpart B to vessels and vessel sections found in shipyards during ship repair and ship breaking; 1915.16 applies to ship repair only. On November 29, 1988, OSHA proposed to amend its shipyard standards addressing safe entry into and work within spaces containing explosive and other dangerous atmospheres on board vessels and vessel sections in shipyards (53 FR 48092). Under this proposal, OSHA would have applied Subpart B to all types of shipyard work on vessels and vessel sections, including ship building, ship repair, and shipbreaking. The Agency proposed extending the scope of Subpart B in this manner to protect employees entering and working in explosive and other dangerous atmospheres, regardless of the type of work they were performing.   Subsequently, after the closing date for comments on this proposed shipyard rule, OSHA also proposed new rules for confined spaces in general industry (54 FR 24080, June 5, 1989). The general industry proposal would have had the effect of covering land-side (that is, other than shipboard) confined spaces in shipyards, such as piping systems in shops or confined spaces in staging areas.   As noted earlier, SESAC reviewed the general industry proposal and made recommendations regarding its possible application to shipyard work. In June 1992, OSHA reopened the record for Subpart B (57 FR 28172, June 24, 1992), to place the SESAC recommendations in the rulemaking record and to gather additional information on whether or not the proposed general industry confined spaces standard was appropriate for land-side confined spaces entered during shipyard work.

The company, a joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning, said that Dollars 600m of this would be met by insurance companies, leaving it with a pre-tax charge of Dollars 640m, or Dollars 415m after tax, for the fourth quarter of 1993. The scale of the potential costs have raised fears that Dow Corning may not be able to continue without support from its two own-ers. The company said yesterday, though, that it would be able to 'meet ongoing operational needs,' provided the expected payments from insurers were received and its 'evaluation of current financing arrangements' and future business prospects proved correct. Yesterday's announcement came as Dow Corning and other implant manufacturers, including Baxter International and Bristol-Myers Squibb, continue to negotiate over how to divide between them the costs of a tentative Dollars 4.74bn industry-wide settlement.

In spite of the continuing downward pressure on pay in the private and public sectors, private-sector increases look high relative to inflation of 1.7 per cent and a public-sector norm of 1.5 per cent. Pay analysts said uncertainty about the direction of the inflation rate after leaving the European exchange rate mechanism might have contributed to the relatively buoyant private-sector pay rates of the final quarter of last year. Industrial Relations Services, which found average awards at 3.6 per cent in the final quarter of last year, said that eight out of 10 deals were above the inflation rate during that quarter. The union-funded Labour Research Department has also found average settlements settling at 3.6 per cent in the three months to the end of January. Some analysts, such as the Confederation of British Industry, have already reported much lower rates in the private sector - 2.8 per cent in manufacturing in the final quarter of last year and one in three companies making pay freezes, according to the latest CBI figures.

The municipal government decided recently that it will  further boost these sectors this year.    In machinery, 115,000 automobiles are to be churned out in  1994. And stress will be put on machine-tooling, hydraulic  electrogenerating facilities and engineering machines.    In the electronics sector, improvement of video recorders  and  color televisions will enjoy priority as well as advanced  telecommunications and computers.    The chemical industry will develop high-efficiency  pesticide,  first-class paint and other products.    And top-flight metal products will top the agenda in the  metallurgical field.    At present, most enterprises involved in these fields boast  large scale production. And their products have held a large  market share at home. For example, ""Xiali"" cars and ""Dafa""  minibuses from the Tianjin Automobile Company have dominated the  taxi market in large and medium-sized cities.    So far, the industrial output value in Tianjin, north  China's  No. 1 industrial city, has reached some 50 billion yuan.    The city started the development of the four pillar  industries in the 1980s.     "
0,FT941-269 ,"FT941-269 _AN-EC3DVAH0FT 940330   FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (7): Welcome to the big battalions - Foreign financial services are sprouting in Bombay      By RC MURTHY   Foreign financial services companies are rushing to open up shop in Bombay. The caution which characterises the approach of companies in other industries to India is largely absent, as investment bankers, brokers and others hurry to find the best local partners and staff. Major overseas investment banks are anxious for gain a foothold in India. Tiny by international standards, local merchant banks have opted for joint ventures with their foreign counterparts. JP Morgan of the US took the plunge late last year with a 40 per cent purchase of ISEC, an investment bank floated by the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, a diversified development bank. General Electric and Housing Development and Finance Corporation are floating a joint venture for hire purchase credit and other financial services. The latest to arrive are Peregrine of Hong Kong and Daewoo of Korea. Peregrine and ITC Classic, a subsidiary of ITC, the Indian affiliate of BAT Industries, have formed a 50:50 joint venture. Daewoo and CRB Capital Markets, a Bombay securities company, have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate and are yet to work out details. The oldest informal association is a decade old - between DSP Financial Services, an offshoot of an old-established Bombay brokerage, and Merrill Lynch of the US. They now urgently need a formal arrangement to transfer new skills and technology and compete with the new investment banks coming up in India. Another well-established relationship - between Lazard Brothers of the UK and Creditcapital Finance Corporation, an investment bank, has also recently been strengthened with the British merchant bank lifting its stake at CFC to 40 per cent. Ind Global Financial Trust, promoted by Mr R. Sankaran, a former Standard Chartered executive, is associated with Salomon Brothers. Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services, after a brief honeymoon with Bear Sterns, decided to join hands with Orix, the most active Japanese financial company in India. Kotak Mahindra Finance of Bombay and Goldman Sachs are currently in discussions on whether to finalise a formal arrangement. The focus now is on insurance. World insurance majors, Eagle Star, Sun Life, New York Life, AIG and Cigna have sent representatives to India to scout for local collaborators. Sun Life has announced a tie-up with State-owned Life Insurance Corporation. Eagle Star, a BAT Industries subsidiary, will form a joint venture with ITC, once the guidelines are announced. New York Life is talking to HDFC to form a joint venture. The most visible impact is on the stock market. Nearly 150 foreign institutional investors, registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market watchdog, have bought corporate stock on Indian bourses worth nearly Dollars l5bn since the beginning of this year. The inflow boosted the foreign exchange reserves, which hit a peak of Dollars 14bn. The capital flows were halted abruptly as custodial and depository services were unable to cope with the rush. The inflow will get a new fillip after these services are back to normal. Institutions can now either buy on the bourses or negotiate directly private placement of capital by companies. India opened its doors to for eign brokers late last year.

'The exchange of fuel rods at the 5MW reactor in Yongbyon is believed to have been 10 to 15 per cent complete so far,' Yonhap news agency quoted Mr Lee Hong-koo, unification minister, telling parliament. The agency said there were a total of 8,100 uranium fuel rods at the reactor, which could hold vital evidence on whether Pyongyang has developed a nuclear bomb as suspected by some western governments and intelligence agencies. A team of nuclear inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is due to arrive in the North today for talks on the refuelling. Mr Kim Dai-ho, a former official at North Korea's Yongbyon reprocessing plant, told the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun the North had secretly extracted 12kg of plutonium from spent fuel in 1988 despite its public denials. North Korea, which denies trying to develop such weapons, insists the only plutonium it ever produced at Yongbyon was 'a tiny amount' reluctantly owned up to in 1992.

Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, said last night that it would now ask the courts for leave to apply for a judicial review on the grounds that testing prejudged a decision about whether to approve the plant. Ms Bridget Woodman, nuclear campaigner with the group, accused the government of 'allowing the start button to be pressed' and said that a letter from the inspectorate to Greenpeace had not answered the group's concerns. BNF has been waiting since the start of the year for a licence to start operation of the Pounds 2.8bn plant, which has taken nearly 10 years to build. It has argued that by testing the plant now it can save several months' preparation if Thorp is given authorisation. The government's second public consultation, which ends in the autumn, is considering the commercial justification for the plant. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, said yesterday: 'This announcement is yet more evidence that the government's period of consultation is a sham.'   Companies:-  British Nuclear Fuels.

The deadline for agreement has been set for the end of the year, before the country faces a whole series of local, state and national elections in 1994. However, there remain widespread doubts in the nuclear industry over whether the political parties, ranging from the conservative Bavaria-based Christian Social Union to the anti-nuclear Greens, will be able to agree on any consensus. Apart from the future of nuclear energy, the conference will be asked to propose a solution for the direct disposal or reprocessing of nuclear waste, on which the political parties are deeply divided. That question is vital to the long-term future of Britain's Thorp nuclear waste reprocessing plant built by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) at Sellafield, with which the German utilities have a 10-year reprocessing contract. The all-party talks, expanded to include representatives of the energy producers and consumers, trade unions and environmental groups, will also make recommendations on issues such as energy conservation and renewable energy.

Forty large enterprises and enterprise groups have been  listed as the first batch of enterprises in the country to enjoy  preferential treatment in adopting the enterprise technical  center system. These include Jilin Chemical Industrial  Corporation, North China Pharmaceutical Plant, Yatai Enterprise  Group of Chemicals for Agricultural Use, and the China Great  Wall Computer Enterprise Group.    According to the regulations, the listed enterprises will be  exempted from taxation in importing meters and instruments,  chemical reagents and technical data, which China is not yet  able to produce, for their technical centers to develop new  technology. The products in trial production developed by their  technical centers will be exempted from income taxes for a  certain period. The technical centers also enjoy some other  preferential treatments.    Different from most developed countries, China used to  separate research institutes of applied technology from  enterprises.

He said this was probably 'a reasonable estimate' if Iran did not receive fissile materials from abroad. If it did, it could complete a nuclear arms programme earlier, he told a BBC Panorama programme due to be broadcast last night. The US intelligence community has been divided about the state of advance of Iran's nuclear programme. Panorama cited unconfirmed intelligence reports that beryllium, used as a component of nuclear weapons, and uranium pellets for a nuclear reactor had been shipped to Iran from Kazakhstan. Mr Reza Amrollahi, president of the Iranian Atomic Energy organisation, strongly denied that Iran's nuclear programme, including its recent reactor deal with China, was for anything but peaceful purposes. Mr Gates also told the programme there was evidence of an Iranian chemical weapons programme, including choking, blister and blood agents. Estimates of its stockpile ranged from a few hundred tonnes to 2,000 tonnes. Iran was among signatories of a treaty banning chemical weapons in January.   Countries:-  IRZ  Iran, Middle East.

The women, who were retired in 1986, went through the UK courts to the European Court of Justice and to the House of Lords. In 1992 the Lords ruled that the women had been discriminated against because they were retired at 60 when men doing the same work were allowed to stay until 65. The case was remitted by the Lords to the London South Industrial Tribunal with the case for compensation scheduled to start yesterday. There is no ceiling on the amount a tribunal can impose. Unison, the public service union which backed the women's case, said: 'The company made the offer of Pounds 812,794 which averaged Pounds 50,799 for each applicant.' British Gas said that the figures included lost earnings as well as lost pension.

Fermec, better known by its MF Industrial brand name, was formed last October by a management buy-out from Varity Corporation's Massey Ferguson Group. The launch is the most important in the company's history. Mr Richard Robson, managing director, said the four new backhoes could have a dramatic impact on the company, which has projected sales of Pounds 55m this year. Fermec is currently the third biggest European producer of rigid backhoe loaders, behind JCB with about 45 per cent of the market and Case with 20 per cent. Mr Robson said MF Industrial's share of the 10,000 to 10,500 unit market had risen by 3 percentage points to between 12 and 13 per cent since the buy-out, and there was no reason why it could not rise to 20 per cent with the new range.

The noticeboard remains the most popular channel of communication, but many are adopting sophisticated techniques such as electronic mail and television. The report says employers seeking ways to communicate with their workforces consider regular team briefings the best way of achieving feedback from employees. More than half the 915 managers questioned said team briefings were the best method, followed by large staff meetings where managers visit different branches. The report coincides with the society's launch of the Employee Communications Association to promote professional links and qualifications for staff responsible for internal communications. Ms Jenny Davenport, the society's communications specialist, said the report reflected a trend among organisations to try to listen more to employees.

The report containing the figures was accompanied by a strong warning from Lord Fraser, Scottish health minister, that it was not a league table of good or bad hospitals. He added: 'Still less is it about death league tables for Scottish hospitals. This report provides no direct comparisons between hospitals and health boards either in relation to the quality of care or the effectiveness of service.' Industrial areas of Scotland have one of the world's worst records for deaths from conditions such as heart disease and cancer. Many researchers are likely to see the figures as confirmation of the social and economic factors behind this poor health record, rather than a test of the performance of individual hospitals. The report does, however, show a range of differences between hospitals. Nearly 30 per cent of heart attack patients, for example, died within 30 days of being admitted to Fife Healthcare Trust compared with fewer than 16 per cent at Edinburgh Western General hospital. The Scottish average was 21 per cent.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9431 Administration of Public Health Programs.     P806  Hospitals.   Types:-  STATS  Statistics.

The decision is expected to be announced in June by the country's Atomic Energy Commission, which has been assessing Japan's long-term nuclear policy for the past 18 months. The review would include delaying construction of a prototype fast breeder reactor using plutonium as fuel and the launch of a plutonium processing plant. It is a drastic change in stance by the Japanese government, which has staunchly stood by its ambitious nuclear programme formulated in the 1950s. Mr Yasutaka Moriguchi, director in charge of Japan's nuclear policy at the Science and Technology Agency, cited technical difficulties for the delay, and said it had not abandoned its goal of becoming completely energy self-sufficient through recycling nuclear fuel. The shift comes amid mounting international criticism over its plutonium recycling policy, stemming from concerns of nuclear proliferation and the world's current excess supply of plutonium. It also poses questions for Thorp, the UK plutonium reprocessing plant owned by British Nuclear Fuels. Japanese electric utilities are Thorp's largest clients and have shipped 2,300 tonnes of used nuclear fuel to Sellafield to be processed.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

Greenpeace, the pressure group, has opposed the start of testing on the grounds that it prejudges the government's decision on whether to allow the Pounds 2.8bn plant in west Cumbria to start operation. Greenpeace said yesterday: 'If the inspectorate gives permission for testing, then we will go to court and apply for leave for a judicial review.' BNF originally expected Thorp, which will recycle used nuclear fuel, to receive authorisation at the start of this year. Opposition from politicians and environmentalists, however, has led the government to hold a second public consultation on the plant's future, delaying a decision until the end of the year. The inspectorate announced on July 22 that it was 'minded' to allow testing to begin on the condition that BNF paid for decommissioning any contaminated equipment if it did not get the go-ahead for the plant. Since then, the inspectorate has received about 140 responses to its statement, divided roughly equally between those in favour of testing and those opposing it.

By doing so it has ignored the possible gains to BNFL, its customers and the UK economy, that would arise by cancelling Thorp. The economic case that BNFL has put forward for opening Thorp assumes that it would lose all Pounds 4bn of its projected income if the plant were not opened. This scenario is completely unrealistic and should not be accepted without question. It would be far more realistic for BNFL to sell its customers other spent fuel management services, such as spent fuel storage, as a direct replacement for existing reprocessing contracts. It is likely that both BNFL and its customers would benefit from such a switch in contracts. For this to happen, however, the government must take responsibility for bringing the parties to the negotiating table. The government cannot claim that opening Thorp is justified without conducting a full and open evaluation of all possible options.

0,FT941-14799 ,"FT941-14799 _AN-EASC7AAQFT 940119   FT  19 JAN 94 / South Korean groups target core businesses      By JOHN BURTON      SEOUL   South Korea's 30 largest conglomerates, or chaebol, yesterday completed the selection of their main business sectors as part of a government policy to reduce the size of the sprawling business groups. The core industries selected will receive funding benefits under the country's tightly-regulated financial system. They include relaxation of credit controls, and priority government approval for issuing bonds abroad and raising capital on the domestic stock market. The government will also provide research and development support to high-tech companies and ease restrictions on land purchases. It is the latest of several so far unsuccessful government attempts to persuade the chaebol to streamline their operations and specialise in a few industries. Officials have long argued that the chaebol have diversified into too many unrelated industries, which is harming their efficiency and global competitiveness. They have for example, spent capital on expanding their industrial empires in intense competition with one another rather than on developing products through higher research spending. The expansion of the chaebol was fed by cheap government loans as the country rapidly industrialised in the past three decades, although the state has tried to reduce financing in recent years. The 10 largest chaebol, including Hyundai, Samsung, Lucky-Goldstar and Daewoo, were asked by the government to select three core industrial sectors and the next 20 were ordered to pick two sectors to develop. Non-core industrial sectors will be subject to strict credit restrictions. The plan bears some similarity to the last chaebol policy, introduced in 1991, which stipulated that the 30 leading conglomerates had to select three core industries, which would then receive unrestricted bank loans. But that programme failed to reduce the size of the chaebol or fulfil the government's hope that they would select their most advanced industries. Instead, the designated core companies were often those needing the most capital investments, such as the troubled petrochemical industry, or ones with the heaviest debts. The government this time tried to correct some of those problems by proposing that core companies must meet certain conditions to qualify. Selected companies, for example, must already account for at least 10 per cent of group sales, which would indicate that they are already competitive. But the new list of core companies still bears a strong resemblance to the ones picked three years ago. Chemical companies emerged as the largest group of core companies, with 22 being selected, including 13 in the petrochemical area. Other favoured industries included food and beverage (11), motor vehicles (9), energy (9), machinery (6), electronics (6), steel (6) and non-metal minerals (5). In the service sector, 24 companies engaged in trade, distribution and transportation industries were selected; 12 more were in construction. The government may have difficulty in preventing the business groups from using the core companies to funnel funds they obtain to non-core industries, a problem that afflicted the previous policy  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      SOUTH KOREA'S TEN TOP CHAEBOL             Core business sectors and related companies  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hyundai: Motor vehicles (Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Motor Service), electronics (Hyundai Electronics) and energy (Hyundai Oil Refinery, Seil Oil).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Samsung: Electronics (Samsung Electronics), machinery (Samsung Heavy Industries, Samsung Aerospace), chemicals (Samsung General Chemicals, Samsung Chemicals).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lucky-Goldstar: Electronics (Goldstar, Goldstar Electron), chemicals (Lucky, Lucky Petrochemical), energy (Honam Oil Refinery, Saebang Oil).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Daewoo: Motor vehicles (Daewoo Motor), machinery (Daewoo Heavy Industries, Daewoo Shipbuilding  Heavy Machinery), distribution (Daewoo Corp.)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sunkyong: Energy (Yukong, Hungkuk Sangsa, SKI), chemicals (SKC), distribution (Sunkyong, Yukong Shipping).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hanjin: Transportation (Korean Air, Hanjin Shipping), machinery (Hanjin Heavy Industries), construction (Hanil Development, Hanjin Construction).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ssangyong: Motor vehicles (Ssangyong Motor), non-metal mining (Ssangyong Cement), energy (Ssangyong Oil Refinery, Buma Oil).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kia: Motor vehicles (Kia Motors, Asia Motors), machinery (Kia Precision Works), steel (Kia Specialty Steel).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hanhwa: Energy (Kyungin Energy), chemicals (Hanyang Petrochemicals), distribution (Hanhwa, Hanyang Stores, Golden Bell).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lotte: Distribution (Lotte Shopping, Lotte Development), food and beverages (Lotte Confectionery, Lotte Chilsung Beverage, Lotte Ham, Lotte Milk), chemicals (Honam Petrochemicals).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Hyundai Corp.

0,FT932-12062 ,"FT932-12062 _AN-DD3B1AAXFT 930430   FT  30 APR 93 / Liberation Army dons a business suit: The PLA's corporate moves prompt western worries      By SIMON HOLBERTON   IN THE early 1980s Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, sent shivers down Hong Kong's collective spine with his comment that Beijing would station units of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Hong Kong after 1997. Four years away from Britain's handover of the colony to China, the PLA is already in the colony and in force. However, the uniform it wears is the business suit. In the past week, China's military-industrial complex has taken majority interests in two Hong Kong listed companies, raising concerns among military analysts and Hong Kong government officials about the intentions of the PLA in the colony. Last Wednesday Mr Wang Jun, son of the late Wang Zhen, one of China's leading 'long march' revolutionaries, was in town to tell investors and the press of his plans for Continental Mariner, an investment company. Mr Wang is Continental's chairman, a position he holds by virtue of his chairmanship of China Poly Group Corporation, the controlling shareholder of a syndicate which in turn controls Continental. China Poly is the vehicle used by the equipment procurement department of the PLA's general staff to sell Chinese-made arms abroad, and to acquire technology useful to China's weapons development. The president of China Poly and deputy chairman of Continental is Maj Gen He Ping, director of the procurement department and a son-in-law of Mr Deng. On Wednesday night this week, China Aerospace Industrial Corporation (CAIC), China's manufacturer of military and civilian rockets, bought 51 per cent of Conic Investment, which produces liquid crystal displays, televisions and telecommunications equipment on the mainland. The interest was previously owned by Bank of China and China Resources, two of the mainland's leading corporate groups in Hong Kong. Until March, CAIC was part of the aerospace ministry. At the National People's Congress in March the ministry was dissolved and its aviation and astronautics arms hived off into two separate corporations responsible to the State Council, China's highest governmental body, or cabinet. CAIC manufacturers China's 'Great Wall' rocket which is used to launch commercial satellites. But according to military analysts in Hong Kong, CAIC is also closely connected with the PLA's 2nd Artillery which controls China's nuclear capability: it manufactures the delivery vehicle for China's intercontinental ballistic nuclear missiles. According to Stockholm's Peace Research Institute, China sold weapons with a value of Dollars 7.8bn (Pounds 5.1bn) in the five years to the end of 1991. Analysts in Hong Kong say that sales have fallen sharply since the Gulf War of 1991 because of the poor performance of Chinese military hardware, especially tanks, under Iraqi command. As export revenues have come under pressure the PLA has had to look at more creative ways of making money. Under China's foreign investment rules a Hong Kong company, no matter what its ownership, is classed as a foreign investor. It is able to go into partnership with its mainland parent and receive large tax breaks in addition to operating outside the rigid rules applied to Chinese state industries, including welfare subsidies and permanent employment. Both Continental and Conic said they would focus on business on the mainland. Analysts also expect the parents of the two to inject mainland assets into the two companies in due course, a transaction which would lead to a flow of hard currency to the parent. Although analysts see the reason for the acquisitions as primarily financial, many believe there may be security issues involved as well. Under rules devised by Cocom, the Paris-based organisation that vets the west's sales of high technology, it is illegal to sell 'dual use' technologies to China. However, last May the US lifted restrictions on such exports to Hong Kong, with the exception of night vision technology, super computers and cryptography equipment. A Hong Kong government official, noting CAIC's purchase of Conic, said: 'We hope their interest is purely financial. We won't let this (acquisition) escape our attention.' As one military analyst pointed out, the PLA has acquired, through perfectly legal means, Hong Kong registered entities. They could act as conduits for technology transfer to the mainland.

0,FT934-1975 ,"FT934-1975 _AN-DLPC5ACNFT 931216   FT  16 DEC 93 / The Thorp Go-ahead: Ministers accept economic case for waste plant      By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent   British Nuclear Fuels has gained the decision it wanted, although a year later than it had hoped. BNF says the delay has cost it more than Pounds 100m. In giving the go-ahead, ministers made clear that they accepted the company's economic case for the plant. The company has said that Thorp will earn the UK Pounds 900m in its first 10 years of operation. It also says it will make Pounds 500m profit in that period, even after taking account of construction and decommissioning costs. Mr John Guinness, BNF chairman, said yesterday's decision 'is a major step forwards in allowing us to earn billions of pounds of overseas revenue for the UK'. BNF has stressed throughout the debate that it regards these estimates as conservative. It points out that it has customer orders to run at full capacity for 10 years, and has orders for more than 40 per cent of capacity for its second decade. The company says it expects to win more orders for reprocessing for the second decade. Japanese utilities are among its main hopes - Japan's reprocessing facility now under construction could be in operation by then, but the country might not have the capacity to reprocess all of its spent fuel. In the longer term BNF hopes it can build on its expertise and reputation from Thorp to sell nuclear waste management services internationally. It might try to get work helping clean up US military sites, or decommissioning and decontaminating eastern European and former Soviet reactors. Critics say these hopes - short and long-term - are unlikely to be fulfilled. They say that it will be difficult for BNF to win new business for Thorp because cheaper alternatives to reprocessing have emerged. In particular, utilities are likely to look to dry storage - storing used fuel in concrete bunkers for 50 years to 80 years before a final decision on disposal is taken. Support for this view comes from the decision by Scottish Nuclear, the power generator which is one of Thorp's UK customers, to opt for dry storage for part of its fuel. Scottish Nuclear says it vigorously backs the start-up of Thorp and will honour its reprocessing contracts with BNF. But it says dry storage is between 30 per cent and 40 per cent cheaper than reprocessing and it expects to save Pounds 45m a year from adopting that route. Mr Gordon MacKerron, energy economist at Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit, said: 'I do not believe that there is any likelihood of more contracts beyond the first 10 years - customers no longer see any economic reason to reprocess because of its cost.' The worst outcome for BNF is that it fails to get new customers, and that existing customers pull out from contracts. In giving the go-ahead ministers said there was no evidence that customers would try to pull out, although critics have said there are political as well as economic reasons why they would be tempted to do so. In particular some economists have said that public hostility would make it hard for foreign customers to repatriate uranium and plutonium as their contracts require. BNF's reply is that under tough penalty clauses customers would be obliged to compensate it. But it has not disclosed the relevant details of the contracts. Critics have said that if customers started to withdraw, its profit estimates could be rapidly whittled away. As many of the responses to the second public consultation point out, BNF's projections correspond to only one of many scenarios for the next decade and beyond. The company is now in a position to test its belief that more business is out there. It may take years, however, to establish whether the fears of Thorp's critics about the economics of the plant are justified.   Companies:-  British Nuclear Fuels.

Once the fastest ship on the oceans, Turbinia was the world's first turbine-propelled vessel. Its construction in 1894 changed the face of maritime engineering. The ship was designed by Sir Charles Parsons, inventor of the steam turbine and one of a highly influential set of engineers who made Victorian Tyneside an internationally renowned centre of innovation. Turbinia astonished spectators at Queen Victoria's Spithead review in 1897, setting a record speed afloat of 34 knots, about 40mph. The ship was laid up in 1908 and for the past nine years the fragile 100ft long vessel has been in storage in Newcastle, away from public view. Yesterday, in a painstaking two-hour removal operation, it was transported by road at 5mph on a specially constructed cradle. Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, which includes turbine-generator manufacturer Parsons, the company founded by Sir Charles, paid the Pounds 62,000 cost of moving Turbinia and making the structural steel supports on which it will rest at the museum.

ABB is taking a 76 per cent stake in ACC-Babcock (ABL), a former private company which came under government control after it accumulated losses and sought legal protection from bankruptcy. The remaining 24 per cent of the equity will stay in the hands of the government and of minority shareholders. The government's Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, the body which nurses ailing companies, has approved the deal. While the purchase price is modest, reflecting ABL's poor recent financial record, the investment marks an increase in ABB's commitment to India because the European company will take on ABL's 5,200 staff, doubling its total payroll in the country to 10,000. Also, ABB plans to modernise ABL's equipment and introduce new technology. ABB said the acquisition would allow the group to serve the growing Indian market for industrial and power station boilers. ABL's products would complement ABB's existing output of turbines and generators.   Companies:-  ABB Asea Brown Boveri.   Countries:-  SEZ  Sweden, West Europe.     CHZ  Switzerland, West Europe.

At the close the Dow was up 17.58 at 3,004.46. The broader- based Standard  Poor's 500 also rose to a new high, up 2.84 at 390.46. The Nasdaq composite of over-the- counter stocks climbed 4.56 to 511.31, another record. Turnover on the New York SE was exceptionally heavy at 248m shares, boosted by computer program trading and strong institutional demand. Advancing shares outpaced declining shares by almost two to one. After opening slightly weaker the Dow spent the day moving back and forth either side of 3,000 before late afternoon demand helped the index to its record. Analysts have been expecting the Dow to set a record soon. After the 53-point gain on Tuesday yesterday was seen as the most likely day for a new closing high for the blue-chip index. Although the current reporting season has so far been a mixture of good and bad, the market has risen on the belief that the recession is nearly over. The fact that the Federal Reserve has not cut interest rates recently, while initially disappointing, is now being interpreted as a sign that the Fed is confident the economy can rebound from its trough without the need for lower interest rates. Among individual issues ATT rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 on turnover of 2.4m shares after the telecommunications group unveiled earnings of 65 cents a share in the first quarter, up from 62 cents a share a year earlier. ATT also said it was not ready to raise its bid for NCR, the computer group which has resisted ATT's unwanted Dollars 110 a share bid. Yesterday NCR shares were down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 97 7/8 . United Technologies slumped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 45 3/4 on turnover of 3m shares after the defence group reported, late on Tuesday, a fall in first quarter income from Dollars 1.01 a year ago to 25 cents this year. Philip Morris, one of the market's biggest stocks, eased Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 70 1/4 after the tobacco and foods group met market expectations with net earnings of Dollars 942m in the first quarter. AMR, the parent group of American Air lines, rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 63 3/8 in spite of announcing a loss of Dollars 195.6m for the first three months of this year. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the troubled publishing and insurance group, fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars  13/16 after General Cinema, the cinema and retailing company, said talks with Harcourt bondholders had broken down, threatening the merger agreement between the two companies. General Cinema shares slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 23 1/2 . Canada TORONTO prices drifted higher in moderate trading before a late pullback took away half of the day's gains. The composite index ended the day up 6.20 at 3545.93. Volume of 28.25m shares was above the previous day's 22.56m and value jumped to CDollars 367.0m (CDollars 234.9m).

Analysts had believed that it was impossible for one man to cope as chief executive and be responsible for RD. Glaxo last year spent nearly Pounds 600m on RD - more than any other pharmaceutical company. It has research sites in the UK, US, Italy, France and Spain and employs more than 6,800 RD specialists. Dr Ando, who joined Glaxo in 1989 as medical director, was made deputy RD director in March last year. He was responsible for co-ordinating all development, medical and regulatory functions in the company's international pharmaceutical development programmes. He retains responsibility for world-wide drug development. A 44-year-old Swede, Dr Ando was previously at Astra, the Swedish group, where he was president of the group research centre. Before that he held positions at Pfizer and Bristol-Myers. Dr Sykes retains the chairmanship of Glaxo group research as well as responsibility for RD on the Glaxo board.

The program emphasized the need for the government to  augment  ongoing efforts in the private sector for realizing such a  society, in particular through integrated networking of computer  and telecommunications systems.    Specifically, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) called for promotion of such networking in five  sectors -- education, research, medical and welfare services,  administrative operations and public libraries.    The task, however, will be impossible to achieve unless the  government makes efforts to improve business, technical and  social conditions in these areas, the program said.    It said the conditions include computer standardization,  establishing security systems in computer-related business,  protection of intellectual property rights, deregulation of  various rules and upgrading telecom-related infrastructure, the  program said.    MITI said the program was formulated to give concrete shape  to policy measures recommended last June by the Industrial  Structure Council, an advisory body to the trade minister.    In the past year, a drive to build information-oriented  societies has been accelerated on a global basis, including the  national information infrastructure scheme proposed by the  United States and the trans-European network program by Europe.

The Commission for Racial Equality said the appeal judgment demonstrated the need for specialist tribunals to deal with race-discrimination cases. The claim was brought in November 1990 before the London South Industrial Tribunal by Mr Minya Laher, a senior lecturer in financial management at Westminster College, London. He claimed that his failure to be shortlisted for two teaching posts at another college amounted to racial discrimination. The tribunal, chaired by Mrs Stella Hollis, dismissed his claim. However, Mr Justice Morison said Mrs Hollis had shown bias and acted irregularly by denying Mr Laher the opportunity to explore evidence. She was also criticised for querying whether Mr Laher could speak English properly. Mr Herman Ouseley, CRE chairman, said the case vindicated the commission's concerns about tribunals in race cases. 'The commission has long advocated the need for specialist tribunals in discrimination cases. This case demonstrates that adjudication in such cases requires special skills and good cross-cultural understanding.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The restructuring programme is unusual for 'non-banks', the leasing and consumer credit companies often blamed by the Ministry of Finance for the excessive lending that fuelled stock and property speculation during the late 1980s. Japan Housing Loan confirmed that it and three other institutions - Japan Leasing, Nippon Housing Loan and Jyuso - were considering a purchase of properties owned by Sueno in an attempt to reduce its debts, reported at Y600bn (Dollars 4.9bn). The case highlights the close links between many of the so-called 'non-banks' and mainstream banks, which often have strategic holdings in these institutions. Seven trust banks have an involvement in Jyuso, while the Industrial Bank of Japan has links to Japan Housing Loan. The Bank of Japan, fearing that weaker non-bank institutions could collapse under the weight of bad property and stock-related loans, has advised mainstream banks that they should take responsibility for the non-banks' health and that of their leading clients.

British Nuclear Fuels, operator of the site, confirmed that the level of liquid in one of seven huge concrete silos had fallen. An official from the Pollution Inspectorate, which reports to the Department of the Environment, was yesterday trying to establish whether a leak had occurred. The disclosure comes at a sensitive time for BNF. The company is waiting for a licence to start operating its Pounds 2.8bn Thorp reprocessing plant, also on the site. The second public consultation on Thorp ended on Monday. BNF said that if any liquid had escaped, levels of radioactivity would be very low, 'equivalent to that which we routinely discharge to the sea'. It had not detected any increase in radioactivity. For the past few months BNF has been carrying out a multi-million pound refurbishment programme on the tanks, which contain intermediate level radioactive waste. A final decision on Thorp is expected in mid-November. It also emerged yesterday that the DoE has decided not to become involved in the decision on licensing a new plant at Sellafield. The decision will be made by Copeland Borough Council.   Companies:-  British Nuclear Fuels.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P2819 Industrial Inorganic Chemicals, NEC.

In its summary report on foreign trade statistics for 1993,  the department said total imports fell by 15.4 per cent to  1,261.1 million [m] Cyprus pounds (one Cyprus pound is about two  U.S. dollars), compared with 1,490.8 m pounds.    Imports for home consumption decreased by 13.1 per cent to  1,067.0 m pounds as against 1,228.1 m pounds in 1992.    Total exports accounted for 431.5 m pounds compared with 443  m pounds in 1992.    Domestic exports fell to 206.6 m pounds from 220.5 m pounds  while re-exports increased to 224.9 m Pounds from 222.6 m pounds.    The European Union (EU) absorbed 57.2 per cent of Cyprus  domestic exports which accounted for 114.4 m pounds followed by  the Arab countries with a 23 per cent share which corresponded  to 46 m pounds.    Exports to both of these regions marked a slight drop from  1992 figures.    Industrial products of domestic produce exported accounted  for 78.7 per cent or 157.2 m pounds compared with 83.3 per cent  in 1992 with footwear and clothing accounting for nearly 60 per  cent of these exports.

The cloud of harmful substances is marked with chaff  with a rate of sedimentation closely matching that of the  tracked substance. Several materials with different rates of  sedimentation may be used to track various components of the  cloud.. The chaff is to be installed in the stacks, ventilators,  and other structural elements of the plant and may be released  on command or automatically when the maximum permissible  concentration of a substance is exceeded in the emission.  Figures show how this method was used to track the vertical and  horizontal position and configuration of a cloud of chaff. A  similar experiment conducted in the US with aluminized mylar  chaff is noted. The maximum tracking distance for various  diffusion conditions is determined.

0,FT934-2023 ,"FT934-2023 _AN-DLPC5ABBFT 931216   FT  16 DEC 93 / The GATT Deal: The deal is done    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UP TO NOW  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Industrial Tariffs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The backbone of previous Gatt rounds. Tariffs on manufactures average 5 per cent in rich countries, down from 40 per cent in the late 1940s.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High farm subsidies and protected markets in Europe and US lead to overproduction and dumping of cut-price surpluses, squeezing exports of more efficient producers. Farm supports by OECD countries amount to Dollars 354bn in 1992.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Services  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- No international trade rules cover services such as banking and insurance, transport, tourism, consultancy, telecommunications, construction, accountancy, films and television, and labour services. Countries protect industries from foreign competition.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Intellectual Property  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Standards of protection for patents, copyrights, trademarks vary widely. Ineffective enforcement of national laws a growing source of trade friction. Trade in counterfeit goods reaches alarming levels.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Textiles and Clothing  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rich countries restrict since 1974 imports of textiles and clothing through bilateral quotas under Multi-Fibre Arrangement. Countries maintain high textile import tariffs. Protection raises prices but fails to protect jobs.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Anti-dumping  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Countries allowed to combat dumping (exports priced below domestic prices) with anti-dumping duties. Anti-dumping actions proliferate and increasingly seen as disguised form of protectionism.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subsidies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subsidised exports can be countered with countervailing duties but, like anti-dumping duties, are cause of growing trade tension and increased disputes.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Safeguards  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Safeguard actions protect domestic industry from sudden import surges which threaten serious injury. EU and US especially bypass non-discrimination obligation by pressuring countries to concede 'voluntary' export restraints and other measures of doubtful legality.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt Rules  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt remains much the same as when drafted in 1940s even though many more countries have since entered world trading system. Trade patterns have shifted, and new forms of protection have sprung up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Barriers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Product regulations and standards extensively used by governments to ensure products are safe for consumers and the environment. Varying standards can be disguised trade barriers.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Government Procurement  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Procurement covered by Tokyo Round agreement which opened many areas to international competition: 12 signatories (EU counting as one).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- World Trade Organisation  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt originally envisaged as part of the International Trade Organisation (third pillar of Bretton Woods institutions alongside World Bank and IMF). ITO not ratified and Gatt still applied provisionally.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dispute Settlement  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gatt increasingly deals with intractable disputes. Procedures do not cover some important areas such as intellectual property and services, and countries increasingly ignore recommendations.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT'S TO COME  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Industrial Tariffs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Tariffs on industrial goods cut by rich countries by more than a third. Over 40 per cent of imports enter duty-free. Key traders scrap duties for pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, medical equipment, steel, beer, furniture, farm equipment, spirits, wood, paper and toys.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade-distorting subsidies and import barriers cut over six years. Domestic farm supports reduced 20 per cent. Subsidised exports sliced 36 per cent in value and 21 per cent in volume. All import barriers converted to tariffs and cut 36 per cent. Japan's and South Korea's closed rice markets gradually open. Tariffs on tropical products cut by over 40 per cent.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Services  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rules framework for basic fair-trade principles such as non-discrimination. Special provisions for financial services, telecommunications, air transport and labour movement. Individual countries pledge market opening in wide range of sectors.

The reactor would be used primarily for research into eliminating the plutonium byproduct and other radioactive waste from ordinary French reactors, the government said. Superphenix was built at a cost of FFr29bn (Dollars 4.84bn) to produce up to 1,200MW of electricity, but it has run at full power for only 174 days since it was commissioned in 1986. Last month, the French nuclear safety directorate said Superphenix could be restarted, but at less than full power and only if current work to improve the safety of its sodium cooling system was finished. The reactor has been shut down since a liquid sodium fire in July 1990. Yesterday, the government said its decision not to restart the reactor at full power was also because it wanted to limit the quantity of plutonium it produced. A breeder reactor can in theory, as its name implies, produce more fuel than it consumes. This feature was considered an advantage when Superphenix was conceived in the 1970s but has since been undermined by the fall in uranium prices.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.

Unconsolidated pre-tax profits for the first six months to September fell 28.2 per cent to Y11.6bn (Dollars 109.4m) on a 9.7 per cent decline in sales to Y56.2bn. After-tax profits fell 29.5 per cent to Y6.5bn. Sales at the robot division tumbled by 23 per cent to Y14bn. Industrial robots for the auto industry accounted for 50 per cent of total robot sales, down from the previous 70 per cent. Factory automation equipment declined 11.7 per cent to Y33.9bn. However, exports to Taiwan and South Korea were brisk, pushing Fanuc's export ratio above 40 per cent for the first time. During the second half of the year, the company will focus on sales of plastic injection molding machines, the only item to produce firm profits. Plant and equipment investments for the second half will fall by 50 per cent from the previou year, the company said. For the full year to March, Fanuc expects non-consolidated pre-tax profits to fall 27.3 per cent to Y21.2bn on a 10.1 per cent decline in sales to Y105.7bn.   Companies:-  Fanuc.

A seemingly routine survey of the state of U.S.  counterintelligence programs, it was appended to an appropriations bill earlier  this month and all but lost in the daily deluge of paper that flows from  government printing presses.    ""Since its 1986 report on 'Meeting the Espionage Challenge,' the committee has  catalogued numerous cases of espionage and attempted espionage, some of which  had devastating consequences for the United States,"" the report said.    It added, ""We also found that many of the actions set in motion in early years  were faltering as a result of diminishing resources and a lack of continuing  resolve to deal with them effectively.""      Bloch Case in Spotlight    Within days, the committee's central conclusions were driven home in one of the  most extraordinary developments in the long history of spies and counterspies:  the case of suspected Soviet agent Felix S. Bloch.    And beneath the headlines about Bloch's suspected activities and the bizarre  television film of caravans of FBI agents following him trunk-and-tail across  Washington and New York, the case has ignited a major debate within government  circles about U.S. counterintelligence capabilities and the growing number of  failures to uncover spies, some of whom have gone undetected for more than a  decade.    Indeed, the nation's counterintelligence program appears so overburdened that  former KGB agent Stanislav Levchencko, who defected to the United States in  1979, said this week that he was only surprised that American spies at the  State Department had not been uncovered earlier.      'Lax for Decades'    ""It is no secret that the security system at the State Department has been lax  for decades,"" Levchencko declared. ""Professional logic would indicate that  there are at least two or three more spies still operating inside the State  Department who have not yet been found.""    If Levchencko is a less than dispassionate judge, even a senior former U.S.  intelligence analyst conceded that ""historically, counterintelligence has never  been an American forte.""    Current and former intelligence officials say their ability to track down  Americans spying for other governments either in the United States or abroad is  hampered by an inefficient and underfunded system.    Part of the problem is clearly the dispersed nature of responsibility for  counterespionage.    Theoretically, responsibility for tracking down spies inside the United States  rests with the FBI. The CIA is widely considered to be responsible for  counterintelligence operations overseas. The State Department's Diplomatic  Security Office, a relatively new office, is charged with security at  diplomatic installations abroad. The Defense Department has parallel  responsibility for military installations in other countries.    In practice, there are yawning gaps in the net.    The CIA concentrates on watching for penetration of U.S. security by foreign  agents -- the bugging of embassies, for example, and terrorist threats; it  gives less attention to the activities of Americans spying on the United States  overseas. The State Department and Pentagon efforts are similarly defensive:  They concentrate most of their resources on protecting American personnel and  facilities from outside threats.    Even at the basic gate-keeping level of controlling access to sensitive  material, the problems are staggering and the government effort limited,  officials say.    An estimated 4 million Americans have official security clearances and  therefore have access to classified documents of varying degrees of  sensitivity. But the budget for screening those receiving such clearances has  been cut back in recent years.    The screening system itself is antiquated and inconsistent, officials add. The  procedure is so limited, one counterintelligence specialist charged, ""that the  average applicant is likely to be more thoroughly checked for a mortgage than  for a security clearance.""    The bulk of security checks do not go much beyond verification of background  information, checking references and determining that the subject has no police  record.    Questioning friends or neighbors, or sending agents door to door to investigate  the private life styles or habits of individuals in sensitive positions is  unrealistic and beyond the budget resources of most agencies, said one Justice  Department official.    ""Lots of people used to argue that the polygraph (lie detector) was the answer  -- then you would have no need of background checks. But then they found that  the polygraph was not foolproof, so it was not an answer,"" said Americo R.  Cinquegrana, deputy counsel for intelligence policy at the Justice Department.    ""There is still debate over which techniques are the most effective.""    The last two executive orders establishing general criteria for employment by  the federal government were issued by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the  1950s, when the Cold War raged and most espionage was linked to ideological  sympathy with communism. Accordingly, security checks tended to concentrate on  a search for links to suspected groups and organizations -- often in earlier  stages of the subject's life.    Today's spies have been linked largely to financial gain or entrapment tied to  sexual activity, but counterespionage programs have not been modified to meet  the changing nature of the threat.    Not only do more than a dozen different agencies now use different criteria and  methods but follow-up investigations also are limited and sporadic.    ""Most spies were recruited after they joined government, not before,"" said one  former intelligence official. ""With little follow-up, that means they can go  undetected unless they slip up or someone informs on them.""    Indeed, several of the cases uncovered in the 1980s, now referred to as the  ""decade of the spy,"" were due to informants or through accidents. The only  known evidence against Bloch, a videotape of him handing what is believed to be  a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris, was ""inadvertent,"" according to State  Department sources. The Soviet citizen was being watched, not Bloch.    Similarly, the activities of John Walker Jr., a Navy chief warrant officer who  spied for the Soviets for 18 years, were uncovered only after his wife went to  the authorities.    ""Our counterintelligence is better than it was in the 1970s, but the U.S. is  showing that it is not up to the task of counterintelligence in the 1990s and  apparently not of the 1980s, especially if we're not able to find a guy after  10 years,"" said Kenneth E. deGraffenreid, a former senior director of  intelligence at the National Security Council who is now at the National  Strategy Information Center.    Bloch's alleged espionage for the Soviet Union reportedly may date back a  decade or more.    Critics lay blame for counterintelligence failures on the executive branch,  which they charge has virtually ignored every official assessment outlining  weaknesses in the counterspy program since a wave of spies was uncovered in the  mid-1980s.    ""For four years, the government has been aware that there is a real problem  with espionage by Americans,"" said Allen Adler, a former counterintelligence  specialist at the American Civil Liberties Union. ""And there has been  sufficient evidence to give advance warning in each of the cases over the past  two decades.    ""But the government has not heeded any recommendations that have come out of  Congress or various commissions within the Department of Defense and other  agencies to determine what can be done to prevent these problems,"" he said.    In 1985, Congress recommended cutting back on both the volume of data  classified and the number of people given clearances. But Adler and other  counterintelligence specialists say both the Reagan and Bush administrations  have failed to adopt the recommendations.    ""There are too many people who have access to classified data, but it is a  function of the amount of data classified,"" said Cinquegrana of the Justice  Department. Both government officials and critics agreed that the United States  classifies far too much information that is not politically or militarily  sensitive.    Explained DeGraffenreid, who worked in the Reagan Administration:  ""Counterintelligence has become a backwater of bureaucratic inertia and  lethargy. They're comfortable with the way things have been done in the past,  and they don't want to be told by others how to do it better.""    The price of U.S. counterintelligence weaknesses is likely to rise, experts  say, because the Soviet Union is upgrading its already formidable foreign  espionage.    Levchencko said that, contrary to popular conception, the Soviet policy of  glasnost, or openness, has actually led to a greater need for foreign  intelligence than during the Cold War era.    Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ""is more pragmatic. But with the collapse  of industry and the economy, he is also forced to cut large parts of the  budget, even for the military. To compensate, he has to keep up with what the  United States and the West are doing. He relies on intelligence more than ever  so the Soviet Union is not left vulnerable.""    Added DeGraffenreid, ""The Soviets are showing an ability to penetrate a new  range (of government agencies), from the military to the State Department.    ""These are major kinds of spies, not chicken-feed triple agents. It shows that  it's not only the low-level spies who hurt you, like Walker, who gave away  codes. If this (Bloch case) is all true, as it appears to be, then this is a  really big, big deal.""    Even if no arrests are made in the current case, the allegations already have  triggered congressional interest in increasing the resources available to U.S.  counterintelligence.    ""The fact that the Soviets have had a certain amount of success in buying  traitorous Americans would indicate that we should put more resources into  counterintelligence,"" Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.) said.

The decision was forced on the government by the European Court of Justice, which ruled in August that Britain's statutory ceiling was unlawful. The government has gone further than the EC law required and decided also to abolish the limits for racial discrimination, and for religious discrimination in Northern Ireland. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said he hoped that regulations to abolish the compensation ceiling for sex discrimination would come into force later this month. Amending the penalties for other forms of discrimination will take longer, since it requires primary legislation. The move prompted speculation that the government may have to concede at some stage that the Pounds 11,000 limit on Industrial Tribunal cases of unfair dismissal is no longer tenable. Mr David Pannick QC, who has been examining the implications of the European Court ruling, said there was nothing in EC law that barred an upper limit for unfair dismissal claims.

The Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations told  Interfax that the two states were to increase mutual deliveries  of oil and sugar in 1994. Russia would export 4 Mn [million]  tons of oil by the end of 1994 (instead of 2.5 Mn tons, the  delivery of which was coordinated in late 1993) in exchange for  2.5 Mn tons of cane sugar, exceeding the earlier expected volume  of deliveries by 2.5 times.    According to Russian Foreign Economic Relations Minister  Oleg  Davydov, ""Russia is very interested in importing Cuban sugar  since it has big industrial capacities specially established for  processing of cane sugar.""    Russia and Cuba also intend to develop bilateral cooperation  in other spheres. An International Russian-Cuban Trade Economic  Association Roskuba was established last week in accordance with  the inter-government agreement of December 24, 1993. The  association includes more than 10 Russian state and commercial  structures, for instance the joint stock companies  Aeroflot--Russian Air Lines, Ingosstrakh, Vneshtreidinvest,  Rosdetspetsprodukt, the state committee Rosvooruzhenie and the  Russian Federation Trade Industrial Chamber.    The association's main purposes are to contribute to the  development of trade, direct relations between enterprises and  organizations, mutual utilization of industrial capacities and  investment and to establishment of trans-national commercial,  finance and industrial structures.

Mr Alphandery said orders for the issue, the second in the government's privatisation campaign, demonstrated support for its plans to sell public sector companies and expand popular shareholding. The strong demand from individual investors means that the French government will exercise a clawback option to reduce the tranche allocated to institutional investors. As a result, the number of shares for individuals will be raised to 52.3m from 47.5m. Individual investors will see their allocations reduced below the 60 shares which was set as the maximum subscription. The government will announce today how many shares will be granted to individuals. The price for individual investors was set at FFr146 per share, compared with the public offer price of FFr135. Yesterday, Rhone-Poulenc shares closed at FFr153.9. Mr Alphandery said the sale of the government's 43 per cent stake had seen strong demand from French and international institutional investors. Of the 26.9m shares to go to institutional investors, 36.25 per cent are for French companies, 19 per cent to US companies, and 8.5 per cent to Japan.

Referring to today's vote in the European parliament, the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe said the EU would benefit economically by admitting Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. 'A successful conclusion to enlargement will boost confidence in the European Union and strengthen the policies to achieve renewed competitiveness, sustained growth and increased job generation,' it said in a statement. The parliament's assent is necessary for the four countries to join the EU as planned on January 1. Officials have predicted a 'yes' vote, but many MPs have been irked by an arrangement on voting procedures for a bigger Union - made to win over Britain to the expansion plans - which they say would undermine the powers of the parliament, the EU's only directly elected body. Unice said it shared the parliament's wish for efficient, transparent and democratic institutions. 'But the applicant states, with their strong traditions of openness and democracy, will only add strength, not weakness, to the pursuit of such reform,' it said.

0," FR941213-2-00009   FR941213-2-00005        Separate Rates       All five respondents have requested separate antidumping duty rates. In cases involving non-market economies, the Department's policy is to assign a separate rate only when an exporter can demonstrate the absence of both     de jure     and     de facto     governmental control over export activities. In determining whether companies should receive separate rates, we focus our attention on the exporter rather than the manufacturer, as our concern is manipulation of export prices, and we examine PRC government control of the exporter. In this case, two of the five respondents are Hong Kong exporters that are involved in joint ventures in the PRC that manufacture lighters. Since PolyCity and Cli-Claque are located outside the PRC, the PRC government does not have jurisdiction over them. Moreover, the PRC government does not have any ownership interest in these exporters and, therefore, it cannot exercise control through ownership of these companies. Further, we have no evidence on the record indicating that the PRC government exerts control over these exporters. (See, business proprietary memorandum to the file dated December 5, 1994.) On this basis, we preliminarily determine that there is no need to apply our separate rates analysis and that PolyCity and Cli-Claque are entitled to individual rates.   In contrast to PolyCity and Cli-Claque, Gao Yao is a 50/50 joint venture between a Chinese company and Hong Kong company. The joint venture owns both the production and export facilities used to manufacture and export the lighters it sells to the United States. Given the direct PRC ownership in Gao Yao's export facilities, we have preliminarily determined that it is appropriate to apply our separate rates analysis to this company.           COTCO's and GLIP's business licenses indicate that they are owned ``by all the people.'' As stated in the Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the PRC (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994) (``Silicon Carbide''), ``ownership of a company by all the people does not require the application of a single rate.'' Accordingly, these companies are eligible for consideration for a separate rate under our criteria.   To establish whether a firm is entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes each exporting entity under a test arising out of the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the PRC (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (``Sparklers'') and amplified in Silicon Carbide. Under the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate rates only where respondents can demonstrate the absence of both     de jure     and     de facto     governmental control over export activities.       1. Absence of De Jure Control       The respondents submitted a number of documents to demonstrate absence of     de jure     control, including two PRC laws indicating that the responsibility for managing enterprises owned by ``all the people'' is with the enterprises themselves and not with the government. These are the ``Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (``1988 Law''); and the ``Regulations for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved on August 23, 1992 (``1992 Regulations''). Respondents' submission also included the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,'' approved on December 21, 1992 (``Export Provisions'').   The 1988 Law and 1992 Regulations shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The 1988 Law provides that enterprises owned by ``all the people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers and purchase their own goods and materials. The 1988 Law contains other provisions which indicate that enterprises have management independence from the government. The 1992 Regulations provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make their own production decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits (Article II); sell their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions (Article XIII); dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire employees without government approval (Article XVII).   The Export Provisions indicate those products subject to direct government control. Lighters do not appear on the Export Provisions list and are not, therefore, subject to export constraints.   Consistent with Silicon Carbide, we determine that the existence of these laws demonstrates that COTCO, GLIP, and Gao Yao are not subject to     de jure     central government control with respect to export sales and pricing decisions. However, there is some evidence that the provisions of the above-cited laws and regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see ``PRC Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' in Foreign Broadcast Information Service-China-93133 (July 14, 1993)). Therefore, the Department has determined that a     de facto     analysis is critical to determine whether COTCO, Gao Yao and GLIP are subject to governmental control over export sales and pricing decisions.

Tsai]    [Text] Taipei, Jan. 27 (CNA) -- Officials from Taiwan and  Thailand Thursday [27 January] opened a series of meetings on an  investment guarantee agreement between the two countries.    Ch'en Yung-hsiang, deputy director-general of the Industrial  Development and Investment Center, is representing Taiwan at the  negotiations. He said the talks would continue into Friday.    The Thai delegation is led by Chaiyong Satjipanon [as  received], deputy director of the Economic Affairs Department  under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    The 10-member Thai group includes Nopporn Ratchawej, deputy  director of the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taipei,  Lek Boonsriroj [as received], chief of the Commercial Division  of the Thai Office, and officials from the Ministries of  Agriculture, Industry, Finance, and Transportation.    Chaiyong expressed hope that the ongoing talks can reach a  final agreement. Taiwan and Thailand exchanged a draft proposal  on the investment guarantee pact last February.    Signing of the agreement will certainly boost Taiwan  investment in Thailand, he noted.    Among the six member countries of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations, only Thailand and Brunei have not  signed the investment guarantee pact with Taiwan. The other  four members are Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the  Philippines.    Statistics show that Taiwan is the third largest foreign  investor in Thailand with 1,098 investment projects, totaling  US$4.5 billion, as of the end of 1993.     "

Listing of Acceptable Substitutes        This section presents EPA's most recent acceptable listing decisions for class I substitutes in the following industrial sectors: refrigerants and air conditioning, foam blowing, solvent cleaning, fire suppression and explosion protection; sterilants; aerosols; adhesives, coatings and inks. These decisions represent substitutes not previously reviewed in the final rulemaking for SNAP (59 FR 13044; March 18, 1994) and, consequently, add to the lists of acceptable substitutes under SNAP. For copies of the full list, contact the EPA Stratospheric Protection Hotline at the number listed in Section V of this notice.    Parts A through H below present a detailed discussion of the substitute listing determinations by major use sector. Tables summarizing listing decisions in this notice are in Appendix A. The comments contained in Appendix A provide additional information on a substitute, but like the listings themselves, are not regulatory in nature, and thus they are not mandatory for use of a substitute. Nor should the comments be considered comprehensive with respect to other legal obligations pertaining to the use of the substitute. However, EPA encourages users of acceptable substitutes to apply all comments to their use of these substitutes. In many instances, the comments simply allude to sound operating practices that have already been identified in existing industry and/or building-code standards. Thus, many of the comments, if adopted, would not require significant changes in existing operating practices for the affected industry.    As described in the final rule for the SNAP program, EPA does not believe that rulemaking procedures are required to list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. Such listings do not impose any sanction, nor do they remove any prior license to use a substitute. Consequently, EPA is adding substances to the list of acceptable alternatives without first requesting comment on new listings.    EPA, however, does believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required to place any alternative on the list of prohibited substitutes, to list a substitute as acceptable only under use restrictions, or to remove a substitute from either the list of prohibited or acceptable substitutes. Updates to these lists are published as separate notices of rulemaking in the Federal Register.        D. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning        1. Overview        The refrigeration and air conditioning sector includes all uses of class I and class II substances to produce cooling, including mechanical and non-mechanical refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat transfer. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for a more detailed description of this sector.    The refrigeration and air conditioning sector is divided into the following end-uses:    Commercial comfort air conditioning;    Industrial process refrigeration systems;    Industrial process air conditioning;    Ice skating rinks;    Uranium isotope separation processing;    Cole storage warehouses;    Refrigerated transport;    Retail food refrigeration;    Vending machines;    Water coolers;    Commercial ice machines;    Household refrigerators;    Household freezers;    Residential dehumidifiers;    Motor vehicle air conditioning;    Residential air conditioning and heat pumps;    Non-mechanical heat transfer; and    Very low temperature refrigeration.        In addition, each end-use is divided into retrofit and new equipment applications. EPA has not necessarily reviewed substitutes in every end-use for this Notice.        EPA has modified the list of end-uses for this sector for this SNAP update. First, EPA has changed the name of the heat transfer end-use to non-mechanical heat transfer. This change is intended to avoid confusion between systems that move heat from a cool area to a warm one (mechanical refrigeration) and systems that simply aid the movement of heat away from warm areas (non-mechanical heat transfer). The second change is that EPA added a new end-use, very low temperature refrigeration. Substitutes for this end-use have been reviewed since the final rule, and therefore have been added for this SNAP update. Finally, EPA has also reviewed substitutes for CFC13, R13B1, and R503 industrial process refrigeration. Please refer to the final SNAP rule (59 FR 13044) for a detailed description of end-uses other than these three. EPA may continue to add other end-uses in future SNAP updates.        a. Non-mechanical Heat Transfer.     As discussed above, this end-use includes all cooling systems that rely on a fluid to remove heat from a heat source to a cooler area, rather than relying on mechanical refrigeration to move heat from a cool area to a warm one. Generally, there are two types of systems: systems with fluid pumps, referred to as recirculating coolers, and those that rely on natural convection currents, known as thermosyphons.        b. Very Low Temperature Refrigeration.     Medical freezers, freeze-dryers, and other small appliances require extremely reliable refrigeration cycles. These systems must meet stringent technical standards that do not normally apply to refrigeration systems. They usually have very small charges. Because they operate at very high vapor pressures, and because performance is critically affected by any charge loss, standard maintenance for these systems tends to reduce leakage to a level considerably below that for other types of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.

The Dutch company blamed falling prices, arguing 'the underlying economics are no longer attractive', but would not be drawn on plans for the future of its two businesses. Siemens said the talks had fallen through because of a variety of reasons. A spokesman said: 'Economic conditions have changed in the 13 months we have been negotiating this deal.' The German company made it clear, however, that it expected its cable business, second in Europe to Alcatel of France, would continue to grow strongly. It had sales of about DM2bn (Dollars 1.2bn) last year, about 30 per cent ahead of the preceding year. 'We have no need to look for partners to fulfil our market goals,' a Siemens spokesman said. 'We have a number of big projects here in Germany and respectable growth in other countries.' Philips' activities in telecommunications cables and optical fibres generate annual turnover of Fl 550m (Dollars 307.2m). A spokesman said turnover growth in the sectors had been flat in 1992, underlining the company's argument that prices were weakening.   Companies:-  Siemens.     Philips.

0,FT934-16617 ,"FT934-16617 _AN-DJEC1AGLFT 931005   FT  05 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei lower as Hong Kong closes at record high      By EMIKO TERAZONO      TOKYO   THE turmoil in Russia undermined enthusiasm for stocks, and the Nikkei index closed marginally lower as investors remained on the sidelines, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei fell 18.70 to 20,264.43 with most investors reluctant to take large positions until the response of other markets to the Russian crisis became clear. The index fell to the day's low of 20,151.32 in the morning session, in tandem with the futures market which lost ground on news of the military confrontation in Moscow. However, late arbitrage linked buying supported share prices and the Nikkei rose to the day's high of 20,283.93 on late bargain hunting. Volume fell to 180m shares from 362m. Declines led advances by 591 to 372, with 214 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged down 0.06 to 1,634.03 while, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.78 to 1,263.23. Index-linked buying by institutional investors supported share prices. One trader said that the Nikkei would have advanced further in a continuation of Friday's strong performance, were it not for the Russian situation. Investors' interest centred on semiconductor-related issues following reports that electronics manufacturers were boosting output of 16-megabit chips. Nikon rose Y25 to Y915 and Tokyo Electron gained Y110 to Y3,030. Sharp jumped Y70 to Y1,550 on firm shipments of its camcorder. Other consumer electronics makers were also strong, with Sony up Y50 to Y4,610 and Matsushita Electronic Industrial gaining Y20 to Y1,450. Investigations by the Fair Trading Commission of menswear discount retailers triggered heavy selling of Aoki International and Aoyama Trading. Aoki fell Y100 to Y5,500, and Aoyama failed to trade due to the lack of buyers. Pharmaceuticals were lower on profit-taking following the recent bout of buying ahead of annual medical conventions. Sankyo fell Y10 to Y3,000 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical lost Y40 to Y2,410. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 35.92 to 22,251.94 in volume of 18.1m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets found a diverse series of influences on trading. HONG KONG shrugged off the latest inconclusive round of Sino-British talks on the colony's future as foreign demand, beginning with US institutions and spilling over to UK and Chinese funds, took shares to a record high close. The Hang Seng index added 68.10 or 0.9 per cent to 7,744.32, after an intraday high of 7,763.87, in relatively thin turnover of HKDollars 3.72m. AUSTRALIA saw the political turmoil in Russia fuel a sharp rise in gold stocks and push the overall market to a higher close, but with a holiday in New South Wales, trade was otherwise dull. The All Ordinaries index added 4.2 to 1,977.0 in turnover of ADollars 165.31m. The gold marker surged 42.5 to 2,006.6 with North Flinders rising 20 cents to ADollars 12.50, Newcrest up 17 cents to ADollars 4.02, Plutonic up 10 cents to ADollars 7.00, and Homestake up 7 cents to ADollars 1.65. MANILA turned sharply lower as banks with big common trust fund (CTF) holdings sold shares to meet a new 10 per cent reserve requirement, which took effect yesterday. The composite index shed 55.01 or 2.8 per cent to 1,904.54. The peso's fall last week prompted the central bank to impose capital requirements on CTFs, which pool small deposits for investment in high-yielding securities like T-bills and stocks. NEW ZEALAND, devoid of any strong overall influence, meandered through thin trade to a slightly higher close. The NZSE 40 capital index rose 6.35 to 1,946.36 in turnover of NZDollars 18.7m. TAIWAN closed narrowly mixed after late bargain-hunting emerged to offset early losses triggered by Russia's political crisis. The composite index ended 1.62 lower at 3,808.24, after an intra-day low of 3,785, in very slow turnover of TDollars 9.72bn. SEOUL fell prey to a wave of profit-taking in reaction to last week's pre-Chusok holiday rally, although some late bargain-hunting helped prices up from their lowest levels. The composite stock index shed 4.50 to 715.05. SINGAPORE, easier for much of the day, picked up towards the close as hopes rose for political stability in Russia. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 4.97 higher to 2,023.07 after trading in negative territory for much of the day. KARACHI closed sharply higher on rumours that the former reformist prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif may win in tomorrow's general elections. The KSE index rose 14.68 to 1,357.05.

The board proposed to increase the dividend to NKr4.10 a share from NKr3.75. Group pre-tax profit rose sharply to NKr1.32bn (Dollars 178m) from NKr315m, as sales increased to NKr17.85bn from NKr16.81bn. Operating profit advanced by 7 per cent to NKr1.27bn. Net financial items charged against accounts fell to NKr523m from NKr606m as share of profit from associated companies nearly doubled NKr219m from NKr112m. Industrial activities lifted operating profit to NKr1.24bn from NKr1.17bn. Branded consumer goods' activities increased market shares for most important products but operating margins fell slightly. Chemicals saw increased demand for important products and improved operating margins as a result of a shift in product mix, efficiency, reduced raw materials costs and favourable exchange rates. Investment activities increased operating profit to NKr29m from NKr20, and recorded a booked pre-tax profit of NKr273m, significantly better than in 1992, when stocks on the Oslo bourse fell heavily. Realised gains on shares in 1993 reached NKr350m against losses of NKr381m in 1992, while unrealised gains shot up by nearly NKr2.5bn from NKr5m.   Companies:-  Anglovaal Borregaard.

This is certainly welcome from the nuclear industry's point of view, but Dieter Helm omits to point out the obvious, that the full costs and benefits of all the alternative fuels have to be encompassed in such an examination. The thorough work already carried out for the Department of Trade and Industry by Professor David Pearce on the full costs of fuel cycles is relevant here, showing as it does the huge external costs of many fossil fuels. External costs identified in this study for nuclear are very modest by comparison. Dieter Helm also implies long-term insight into the future price of gas, in his comments on future nuclear projects versus combined cycle gas turbines. Such a sure insight into the future gas market will draw to his doors a queue of people almost as long as that waiting for the better mousetrap.

For the Texas Department of Correctional Justice, Charter Builders is to build two virtually identical Alberti units at Abilene and Huntsville, Texas. Valued at Dollars 26m (Pounds 17.5m) each, the units will comprise 15 buildings, including gatehouses and guard posts, extending to approximately 320,000 sq ft. They will house 2,000 inmates in a medium security environment, mostly living in dormitory accommodation. Each housing unit has an adjacent outdoor exercise and recreation yard. Fifty isolation cells will also be provided. Construction will primarily be pre-engineered, prefabricated metal buildings. Charter's primary challenge on the projects is the requirement to complete all the buildings within a 240-day period. The third contract, worth Dollars 16m (Pounds 10.7m), is to build Dallas County Juvenile Justice Center, comprising court rooms, detention areas, attorney and social workers' offices and outdoor recreation facilities.

The efficiency  of conversion from light energy to electric energy by solar  cells drops when temperature rises, so experiments will be  carried out to search for an effective way to cool solar cells  in Malaysia, where high temperatures prevail.    The system is composed of monocrystalline solar cells with  10  kilowatt (kw) output, 136 kw hour (kwh) storage batteries, and  data collection equipment. Experiments will be conducted with  several types of natural cooling and forced cooling methods.    In experiments with natural cooling, modules of multiple  solar cells mounted on a single board will be placed on water or  separated from the ground surface; and various angles of  inclination will be tried. In experiments with forced cooling,  the surface of the modules will be sprayed with water or air  will be blown from the back of the modules.    A 100 kw output system will be built in FY95 in order to  switch to large-scale research. NEDO's share of the cost is  about 600 million.     "

"," FR940805-0-00048   FR940805-0-00017        EPA has reviewed Oregon's application, and has made an immediate final decision that Oregon's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant Oregon final authorization for the additional program modifications. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until September 14, 1994. Copies of Oregon's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ``    Addresses    '' section of this notice.     Approval of Oregon's program revision shall become effective in sixty (60) days unless adverse comments pertaining to the State's program revisions are received during the public comment period. If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.     Oregon's revision application includes the majority of HSWA and non-HSWA federal provisions promulgated before July 1, 1993. The more substantive changes included in this revision application are: the Mining Waste Rules, the Land Disposal Restriction Rules, the Used Oil Rule, and the Permit Modification Rule.

0,FT921-14663 ,"FT921-14663 _AN-CAOBBABJFT 920115   FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Nothing bilious about Seville      From Dr EWAN FERLIE   Reading Peter Bruce's bilious piece ('Revels for a state without a creed', January 3) on Spain's plans for its 1992 festivities while on a return flight from Seville, I found his comments on Seville and Andalucia difficult to understand. Unlike northern Spain, it indeed has little 'smokestack' industry, but this may be a strength. Instead, there has been expansion of high-margin agriculture in the countryside, and the service sector in the southern cities. The Expo 92 site in Seville will be re-used as a research and development park. Far from being a 'lethargic, sun-drenched tourist venue' of the 1950s cliche, Seville is a bustling and self-confident centre of economic activity. The problem, if anything, is one of excessive and unsustainable growth (a nice problem to have]). In the long run, with its combination of high-margin agriculture, wine, tourism and research and development, Andalucia could indeed emerge as the California of 21st century Europe.

The regional satellite mainly for commercial communications  in Asia will be launched by the China Great Wall Industrial  Company in Xichang. About half of the transmitters already  hired will be used for television broadcasting while the rest  will be employed in communications.    This satellite is so far the largest commercial one with the  greatest power in Asia while it is also the world's largest and  most advanced communications satellite operated in a static  orbit. The satellite will cover a wide area starting in Tokyo  in the east, stretching to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, to  the Commonwealth of Independent States in the north and to New  Zealand in the south. The total population is put at 3.3 billion  in the region covered by the satellite, making up 63 percent of  the world population. It is expected that life expectancy for  the satellite is as long as 15 years.    The Asia Satellite Limited Company has begun preparatory  work  for the launching of the ""Asia No. 3"" satellite.     "

According to the latest provisional seasonally adjusted estimate from the Central Statistical Office, real capital spending, which includes expenditure on leased assets, was 11 per cent lower than in the same period last year. The decline followed falls of 2.75 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively in the final and third quarters of last year but was less steep than the 8 per cent drop registered in the first quarter of last year. Northern Ireland had one of its worst years for attracting overseas investment last year, the Industrial Development Board, the province's main jobs agency, said yesterday.

When, as frequently happens in safety rulemaking, OSHA promulgates standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, it must explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].'' Thus, national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not at least lessen risk in a significant way.   The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would     a fortiori     not be `reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See     Industrial Union Dep't     v.     Hodgson     [499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (`Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their employers out of business.') [    American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc.,     452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically feasible even if it portends `disaster for some marginal firms,' but it is economically infeasible if it `threaten[s] massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of,' the industry)].''

The Industrial Development Bureau said those businesses  interested in investing in the three countries are largely from  the electronics, machinery, yacht-building, plastics, and  foodstuffs industries. And aiming to further promote trade and  economic ties with those countries, the bureau said it has set  up several ad-hoc groups to provide the latest trade information  on the countries to local businesses.    Additionally, the industrial development and investment  center under the Economics Ministry will hold intensive  week-long seminars for local investors, starting April 20,  focusing on the investment climates in the three countries,  along with information regarding government incentives on offer  from those countries and relevant regulations.

Preliminary Results      The Department of Commerce is conducting an administrative review of the countervailing duty order of certain castor oil products from Brazil. We preliminarily determine the net subsidy to be 0.03 percent     ad valorem,     which is     de minimis,     for the period January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1992. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.      Background      Since the publication of the notice of initiation in the     Federal Register     (58 FR 26960, May 6, 1993), the following events have occurred.  On October 13, 1993, we issued a questionnaire to the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, D.C., concerning the subsidy programs under review. We received a response from the Government of Brazil (GOB) on December 29, 1993, on behalf of itself and the respondent's companies. After reviewing the GOB's response, we issued a supplemental questionnaire to the GOB on January 28, 1994. We received a supplemental response from the GOB on February 23, 1994. From March 7 to 18, 1994, we verified the government and companies' responses in Brazil.      Scope of Review      The merchandise subject to this review is hydrogenated castor oil and 12-hydroxystearic acid. Imports of these products are currently classifiable under the following Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``HTS'') subheadings: 1516.20.90 and 1519.19.40. Although the HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.  The review covers six companies, the period January 1 through December 31, 1992, and 12 programs: (1) Preferential Export Financing under Resolution 950/1009; (2) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings; (3) Preferential Export Financing Under CICOPCRE 626; (4) Preferential Financing for Industrial Enterprises by the Bank of Brazil; (5) Reduction of Industrial Products Tax (IPI) and Import Duties Under Decreto No. 77.065 through BEFIEX; (6) Preferential Financing for National Trading Companies under Resolution 883 of the Banco Central do Brasil; (7) Accelerated Depreciation for Brazilian-Made Capital Goods; (8) Preferential Financing under Resolution 68 through FINEX; (9) Preferential Financing under Resolution 578/83 through FUNPAR; (10) Preferential Financing under Resolution 579/83 through PROEX and PROSIM; (11) Preferential Financing for the Storage of Merchandise Destined for Export under Resolution 330/Portaria 130 of the Banco Central do Brasil; and (12) Green Yellow Drawback (Portaria 68/83).      Calculation Methodology for Assessment and Cash Deposit Purposes      In calculating the benefits received during the review period, we followed the methodology described in 19 CFR 355.20(d)(1) (53 FR 52325, December 27, 1988). Using this methodology we calculated a country-wide rate of 0.03 percent which is de minimis.      Analysis of Program      (1) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings      Under this program, exporters of the subject merchandise were eligible for an exemption from income tax on the portion of their profits attributable to exports. On April 12, 1990, Decree Law 8,034 eliminated this exemption by establishing a 30 percent income tax rate for export profits, which equaled the normal corporate income tax rate. Boley, however, was authorized to use the income tax exemption on export earnings under the terms of a contract with the Commission for the Granting of Fiscal Benefits to Special Export Programs (BEFIEX) until its contract expired. Therefore, despite the fact that the income tax exemption for export earnings was eliminated, Boley received residual benefits from the program during the review period. No other company under review used this program.  To calculate the income tax savings realized by Boley during the review period, we multiplied the income tax deduction taken by the firm under this program by 30 percent, the corporate income tax rate during the review period. We then used the amount of Boley's income tax savings to calculate a country-wide rate. We calculated the country-wide rate by dividing the total income tax savings realized by Boley by the total exports of all products by all of the companies under review. On this basis, we calculated a subsidy rate of 0.03 percent     ad valorem,     which is     de minimis.          Programs Preliminarily Found To Be Terminated      We examined the following programs and preliminarily determine these programs to be terminated. Further, we verified that the respondents did not receive any residual benefits under them during the period of review.      a. Preferential Export Financing Under Resolution 950/1009 Through CACEX (Carteira de Comercio Exterior) of the Bank of Brazil      We verified that this program was terminated on August 30, 1990, by Banco Central Bank do Brasil Resolution No. 1,744.

Two Shell Oil subsidiaries, Shell Chemical and Shell International Chemical, said they were in exclusive negotiations with Texaco to buy the lubricant additive business with a view to merging it with their own chemicals operations. No price was disclosed, but the business had earlier been valued at about Dollars 200m. Lubricant additives are used to enhance the performance of automotive and industrial oils. Texaco's three plants - in Port Arthur, Texas, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Ghent, Belgium - make additives for automotive transmission fluids, motor oil, tractor hydraulic fluids and various types of gear oil. The business came on to the market in April this year when Texaco sold its chemical business to Huntsman Corporation of the US. Huntsman originally agreed to buy the entire business for Dollars 1.06bn, but instead paid Dollars 850m and asked Texaco to help it find a buyer for the lubricant additives segment. Since then Texaco has announced another restructuring involving 2,500 job cuts and the sale of half its US oilfields.   Companies:-  Texaco Inc.     Shell Oil Co Inc.

Greenpeace has indemnified the council against any costs. The Labour-controlled council passed the resolution in spite of opposition from Conservatives and from some unions which say Thorp will generate jobs in Lancashire as well as Cumbria. The Lancashire coast is between 35 and 50 miles south of Sellafield. The council can appeal for review under the Local Government Act 1972 over what it believes are possible public health issues. Mrs Louise Ellman, council leader, said Radmil, an independent radioactive monitoring service, had said that opening Thorp and changing discharge authorisation levels at Sellafield could increase health risks for people in Lancashire. But Mr Nick Johnson, clerk to the Nuclear Workers' Thorp campaign, asked Greenpeace not to proceed. 'In the name of the 8,400 nuclear workers at the Sellafield nuclear site, their families and the further 12,000 jobs that depend on Sellafield, we call on you to accept the outcome of the democratic process,' he said. Labour-controlled Copeland Borough Council, where most people likely to be employed at Thorp live, has also backed the government's move.   Companies:-  British Nuclear Fuels.

Output fell only in the food, drink and tobacco industry, but this was mainly because of abnormally high sugar output in February, which distorted the three-month on three-month comparison. Growth was particularly strong in the engineering industries, which account for more than 40 per cent of manufacturing output. Car and car parts production increased by 7.9 per cent in the latest three months compared with the previous quarter, while strong computer output fuelled a 2.5 per cent rise in electrical and instrument engineering. The milder winter was behind a strong rise in building materials output. This prompted a 6.1 per cent increase in output of minerals and mineral products in the three months to May compared with the previous three months. A 1.9 per cent rise in output of the chemicals and man-made fibres sector stemmed from a strong performance by the pharmaceuticals industry. Output of total production industries - manufacturing plus energy output - rose only 0.4 per cent in the latest three months because of a fall in energy and water pro-duction.

Mrs Janet Gaymer, a partner of City solicitors Simmons  Simmons and head of the society's Employment Law Committee, says tribunals cannot offer justice if they cannot offer proper compensation. The present Pounds 11,000 limit in non-discrimination cases should be more than Pounds 30,000 just to keep pace with wage inflation since 1975, she says. The society believes tribunals should be able to compensate people in full, whatever the nature of their claim. But if the government is not prepared to change the law, it should at least increase the maximum award levels to take account of inflation. Industrial tribunals are also hampered, says Mrs Gaymer, because they cannot take account of a person's earnings over Pounds 205 a week, so anyone earning more than Pounds 10,670 a year is likely to lose out. The only correct course for the government is to remove all limits, she says.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9211 Courts.

The Nikkei average ended 18.91 up at 20,158.02 after a day's high of 20,394.64 set in the early afternoon which reflected buying by overseas investors, domestic institutions, individuals and dealers. However, arbitrage-related selling towards the close, after a fall in the futures index, pushed the Nikkei to a day's low of 20,144.21. Volume rose to 400m shares from 308m. Advances outnumbered declines by 678 to 321, with 168 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 8.10 at 1,639.68, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 3.30 firmer at 1,245.18. Traders said opinion polls which suggested that the ruling Liberal Democratic party could retain its pre-election strength also encouraged index sentiment. 'There is a gradual recovery in confidence as some of the initial uncertainties are starting to be removed,' one trader remarked. Cosmo Oil, the day's most active issue, climbed Y13 to Y880 on reports that it was participating in an oil field development project in Vietnam. Nippon Kayaku, a chemicals group which trailed Cosmo in volume, jumped Y32 to Y866. Buying orders came in on speculation that it would gain a large share in the epoxy resin market, after an explosion at Sumitomo Chemical's epoxy resin plant earlier this month.

Kyocera, the leading maker of semiconductor ceramic packages, put on Y230 at Y6,230 on hopes of firm profits due to a recovery in the semiconductor industry. Speculation that Daini Denden, in which Kyocera has a 25 per cent stake, would apply for listing also supported sentiment. Banks were stronger on hopes of lower interest rates. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y50 to Y3,180 and Sakura Bank Y10 to Y1,650. Brokers were also higher, with Nomura Securities up Y10 to Y2,060.

Neptune Orient Lines dipped 8 cents to SDollars 1.55 amid uncertainty over the exercise price for converting the company's 13.2m preference shares into ordinary stock. Brokers said the authorities were investigating a sharp fall in Neptune shares on Monday over possible price manipulation. TAIWAN reported selling of financial shares as the weighted index slipped 53.30, or 1.3 per cent, to 3,969.17. Turnover was a thin TDollars 14.4bn, against TDollars 15.3bn.

ACTION:     Final rule; amendment of requirements.             SUMMARY:     This action amends 40 CFR part 60, subpart O, Standards of Performance for Sewage Treatment Plants. Specifically, provisions requiring metals analysis of air samples and sludge samples are deleted. This deletion is occasioned by the promulgation of final regulations under section 405(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) on February 19, 1993, which eliminates the reason for metals testing under this subpart.             EFFECTIVE DATE:     This action will be effective April 4, 1994 unless notice has been received, within 30 days from the publication of this rule, that adverse or critical comments will be submitted by an interested party. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the     Federal Register    .

Crumpler, Industrial Studies Branch, Emission Standards Division (MD13), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, (919) 5410881.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         Background         Subpart O of 40 CFR part 60 establishes New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), pursuant to section 111 of the Clean Air Act (Act) for new, modified or reconstructed sewage sludge incinerators. The NSPS limits emissions of particulate matter (PM) discharged to the atmosphere to 0.65 g/kg dry sludge input (1.30 lb/ton dry sludge input) and the opacity of any gases discharged to 20 percent.     Furthermore, the NSPS presents test methods and procedures for compliance demonstration. Among these is paragraph 60.154(d) (3)(5) which calls for the analysis of air emissions samples collected by EPA method 5 and composite samples of sludge for ten metals. This requirement was added to the October 6, 1988 regulation because, ``*** EPA's intention (is) to consolidate existing waste management authorities with the broad authorities provided under section 405 of the CWA. Section 405(d) of the CWA requires EPA to develop regulations for the use and disposal of sewage sludge. The measurement of metals will assist the Agency in establishing guidelines for State and local sludge management programs. Also, this will assist the Agency in determining if future regulatory action is warranted.''         Need for the Action        As EPA has promulgated the final sewage sludge regulations pursuant to section 405(d) of the CWA (published February 19, 1993 (58 FR 9248)), with requirements for testing and control of metals from sewage sludge incinerators that supersede the provisions of 60.154(d)(3) through (5), there is no longer a need to collect data on metals emissions and the metals content of sludge for the development of the CWA regulations pursuant to 60.154(d)(3) through (5). Therefore, 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) shall be deleted from 60.154.     The EPA hereby publishes this amendment to Subpart O to delete paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) to eliminate duplicate and conflicting metal testing requirements for sewage sludge incinerators that are regulated under the Act and the CWA.     The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective April 4, 1994 unless, within 30 days of publication, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.     If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publication of a further notice. That notice will withdraw the final action and begin a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment period.

Argentina is supposedly safe from hazardous wastes coming  from other countries. In principle, a controversial law (24.051)  bans this, though some environmentalists say that its later  enacting regulation (Decree 831/93) leaves open a window through  which some wastes could be introduced, disguised as industrial  components.    It is a fact that throughout the world such materials are  ""roaming around"" in search of storage sites. It is the duty of  the authorities to keep their eyes open and their pockets shut.  [passage omitted]    For Argentina, the enemy is within.    Generators of hazardous wastes and unscrupulous waste  disposal contractors cannot be controlled. The unevenness of  legislation throughout Argentina, the inadequacy of the  organizations that are supposed to conduct controls, and the  lack of industrial facilities to process these materials place  the population at serious risk.    Tragic isolated events may suddenly make the problem  obvious.  The widespread feeling among specialists is that Argentina is  living on a time bomb, and there are no legal or political  mechanisms to dismantle this bomb.     "

The subsidiary, with revenues of Dollars 204m last year, and to be renamed ICA Fluor Daniel, will become 'a single source for clients seeking high-quality, full-service engineering and construction capabilities in Mexico and other Latin American countries', the US company said. The joint venture, which was proposed in November, is one of many recently signed between US and Mexican companies, where the US partner offers capital and technology, and the Mexican knowledge of the local market. In this case, ICA Fluor Daniel will concentrate on industrial construction, offering services for consumer products, petrochemicals, power generation, and the car sector, among others. The venture is expected to help ICA Industrial compete against Bufete Industrial, its main Mexican rival that has long had an association with Kellogg of the US. ICA and Fluor Daniel have already shown interest in constructing several Mexican electric power plants that are now up for tender. Empresas ICA reported revenues of Dollars 1.8bn last year, most of which were gained from heavy construction for the public sector. ICA has won the lion's share of contracts in the government's ambitious toll-road programme.   Companies:-  Fluor Daniel.     ICA Industrial.     Empresas ICA Sociedad Controladora.

According to reports from the Xian Satellite Monitoring and  Control Center and the ""Yuan Wang,"" a ship engaged in  astronautics surveying on the Pacific Ocean, the two satellites  have reached their synchronous orbits and the launch was a  success.    The carrier rocket, ""Long March IIIA,"" is a new type which  the National Astronautics Industrial Company developed and built  for launching China's new satellites for telecommunications and  broadcasting services. The rocket, which is based on the ""Long  March III,"" has incorporated many advanced technologies and its  carrying capacity has increased from its previous 1.4 tonnes to  the present 2.5 tonnes. This was the first time the new rocket  was used. Experts say that the ""Long March IIIA's"" successful  launch shows that the family of Chinese carrier rockets now has  a new member, and that China's capacity for astronautical  launching has reached a new level.    The Chinese Academy of Sciences Space Center uses the  ""Practice IV"" satellite to survey space.

0,FT922-11941 ,"FT922-11941 _AN-CDWA1AAOFT 920423   FT  23 APR 92 / IMF laces growth projections with caution: World Economic Outlook warns governments of need to cut budget deficits after recovery      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent      WASHINGTON   THE International Monetary Fund's latest growth forecasts for the world economy are laced with caution, as befits an organisation that has knocked 1.3 percentage points off the 1992 global growth forecast it made only last October. But the Fund believes there are several positive factors to justify its projections of slow growth this year and accelerating activity in 1993 that are detailed in the accompanying table. Inflation has been generally low and falling, in contrast to the recessions of 1974-75 and 1980-82. This has allowed a substantial reduction of short-term interest rates in North America, the UK and Japan. Large disturbances from the commodity markets have been notable by their absence. Factors that caused last year's weaker-than-expected activity are either no longer at work or are diminishing. The economic effects of the Gulf war have dissipated while households and businesses have reduced their high levels of debt. Developing countries are improving their economic performance. On the other hand, the IMF acknowledges that the projected recovery in industrial country growth to 1.8 per cent this year from 0.8 per cent in 1991 is lacklustre. Growth has been held back by worsening consumer confidence in most industrial countries; increased taxation and high interest rates in Germany, which have resulted in high interest rates elsewhere in Europe; and reduced spending on business investment in Japan. These negative factors continue to cast doubt over the prospects for recovery. approved of the way governments have allowed their budgets to move into deficit to counter falling economic activity. Similarly, countries such as Canada, the US and Britain, which have suffered recession, or Japan, where activity has slowed, have been right to lower interest rates. But its latest World Economic Outlook warns that governments must not lose sight of their medium-term objectives of sustainable growth and price stability. They must therefore be prepared to cut budget deficits when growth recovers - and then keep tight control over government spending - and be ready to tighten monetary policy in case inflationary pressures revive. The need for governments to cut fiscal deficits is one of the main messages of the Outlook. The IMF takes an especially tough line in the case of Germany which, it says, should speed its fiscal consolidation plans. The large fiscal deficit that emerged in the course of unification initially provided considerable stimulus to activity in Germany and its partners, it says. But growth in Europe is now being constrained by the high interest rates required to deal with the resulting inflationary pressures in Germany. The Fund is less harsh on the US, which has had a large budget deficit for the past decade. It regrets that the US and Italy failed to consolidate their budgetary positions during the period of strong growth in the 1980s and urges the US to use growth in the 1990s to cut its deficit. Any discretionary fiscal action by the US should be limited to revenue-neutral tax and public spending reforms that would increase efficiency. In the case of Japan, which is expected to come under pressure from its Group of Seven partners to bring forward public spending, the IMF says 'there is no evident case for a shift in fiscal policy'. It is in the medium term that fiscal consolidation would yield most benefits, the IMF believes. In the case of the US, a credible package of measures to reduce the deficit would boost confidence and demand. The IMF also urges the industrialised countries to make greater efforts to correct other important medium-term structural problems. 'In all the major countries, substantial steps are required to liberalise agricultural trade and reduce domestic support,' it says. In addition, tax policies, particularly in the US, should be overhauled to improve the allocation of savings and investments. Europe's high unemployment points to a need for labour-market reform. The IMF says Japan requires further financial deregulation and reform of competition policy and land management. Germany, meanwhile, must reduce rigidities in its economy, particularly in the industrial and services sectors, and make 'long overdue' cuts in subsidies.

Mr Edward Leigh, trade and technology minister, has not been converted to the controversial theory that electric fields, for example from power lines, directly damage human health. But spelled out a catalogue of accidents caused by radiation leaking from electrical and communications equipment and interfering with sensitive electronic components. The minister was launching a campaign to help companies satisfy a new European Community directive on 'electromagnetic compatibility'. Among the disasters he listed were: A UK worker died when a computer-controlled crane dropped its load prematurely. In Japan, robots went out of control and killed two human operators in a robotics factory. In Germany, anti-lock braking mechanisms suddenly came into operation on cars speeding along an autobahn as a result of interference from a powerful radio transmitter five miles away. Mr Leigh said the EC directive was intended both to remove technical trade barriers and as an environmental measure to combat 'electronic smog'. Every electrical and electronics manufacturer will have to ensure that its products meet strict limits on electromagnetic interference. The complex rules become mandatory in January 1996. For the next three years, as the electronics and communications industries continue to grow, European governments are hoping that voluntary compliance will prevent the electronic smog becoming any more dense.

Absence of De Jure Control         The respondents in this investigation have submitted a number of documents to demonstrate absence of     de jure     control, including three enactments indicating that the responsibility for managing enterprises ``owned by all of the people'' is with the enterprises themselves and not with the government. These are the ``Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (``1988 Law''); ``Regulations for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved on August 23, 1992 (``1992 Regulations''); and the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,'' approved on December 21, 1992 (``Export Provisions'').     The 1988 Law and 1992 Regulations shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The 1988 Law provides that enterprises owned ``by the whole people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers, and purchase their own goods and materials. The 1988 Law also has other provisions which support a finding that enterprises have management independence from the government. The 1992 Regulations provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make their own production decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits (Article II); sell their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions (Article XIII); dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire their employees without government approval (Article XVII).     The Export Provisions list those products subject to direct government control. Coumarin is not included in the Export Provisions list and does not, therefore, appear to be subject to the export constraints of these provisions.     The existence of these enactments indicates that Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native are not     de jure     subject to governmental control. However, there is some evidence that the provisions of the above-cited laws and regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see ``PRC Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' in Foreign Broadcast Information Service-China-93133 (July 14, 1993)). Therefore, the Department has determined that an analysis of     de facto     control is critical to determining whether respondents are, in fact, subject to governmental control.         2. Absence of De Facto Control         The Department typically considers four factors in evaluating whether each respondent is subject to de facto governmental control of its export functions: (1) Whether the export prices are set by or subject to the approval of a governmental authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements; (3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management; and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding disposition of profits or financing of losses (see Silicon Carbide and Sebacic Acid).     Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have each asserted that (1) it establishes its own export prices; (2) it negotiates contracts without guidance from any governmental entities or organizations; (3) its management operates with a high degree of autonomy and there is no information on the record that suggests central government control over selection of management; and (4) it retains the proceeds of its export sales, and has the authority to sell its assets and to obtain loans. In addition, questionnaire responses indicate that company-specific pricing during the POI does not suggest any coordination among exporters (    i.e.,     the prices for comparable products differ among companies). This information supports a preliminary finding that there is a     de facto     absence of governmental control of export functions.     Consequently, Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have preliminarily met the criteria for the application of separate rates. We will examine this issue in detail at verification and determine whether the questionnaire responses are supported by verifiable documentation.     There are two additional issues relating to governmental control that we will consider further for purposes of our final determination. First, Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have indicated that the appointments of their general managers are subject to approval by the local Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureaus (local Bureaus). Second, each of the responding exporters has reported that they are ``administratively subject to'' the local Bureaus. While the significance of the involvement of the local Bureaus is unclear, the respondents have reported that the local bureaus do not control the key functions of the enterprises. However, we will examine at verification the precise nature of the authority that the local Bureaus exercise over the enterprises.         Nonmarket Economy Country Status         The PRC has been treated as a nonmarket economy country (NME) in all past antidumping investigations (see,     e.g.    , Sebacic Acid and Silicon Carbide). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn our former determinations. Therefore, in accordance with section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as an NME for purposes of this investigation.              "," FR940804-2-00008   FR940804-2-00005        1.

Last year, however, GM sold its 50 per cent stake in GMFanuc to its partner, Fanuc of Japan, as part of its strategy to concentrate on its core business of vehicle production. The robots are part of substantial investments by GM at its plants in Belgium, Germany, Sweden and the UK. At least 120 of the robots ABB is supplying will go to the Vauxhall Motors plant in Luton. Most of the robots will be delivered next year, and will be mainly used for spot welding. ABB Robotics said the performance and cost efficiency of its product line were key factors in winning the order against fierce Japanese competition. ABB Robotics' and the renamed Fanuc Robotics are the two biggest suppliers of robots to European industry. Over the past decade, the automotive industry has been the largest customer for industrial robots. It remains important to the robot industry even if growth opportunities are higher in less robotised industrial sectors such as the food industry.   Companies:-  ABB Robotics.

The company said yesterday that it was investing Pounds 9.5m at a site being developed by the Industrial Development Board at Dungannon, Co Tyrone, an unemployment blackspot. Carmen, whose equipment is sold in the UK under the Goodmans name, will be making car stereos at the plant and expects to complete its local recruitment by 1996. The IDB said it had secured the project in the face of stiff competition from several other European countries. Mr Robert Atkins, Ulster's economy minister, said the investment would create significant employment and skills opportunities in the area. He said Carmen had been attracted to Dungannon partly because of the successful power-sharing arrangement on the local authority. Unionist and Nationalist councillors introduced a power-sharing arrangement several years ago whereby the mayor's post is rotated every six months. Mr KH Choy, Carmen's president, said the company had decided to locate to Northern Ireland because the province provided a cost-effective base to expand into the European Community and develop sales in eastern Europe. 'We selected Northern Ireland as our European manufacturing centre because it provides an ideal springboard from which to expand our already substantial field base throughout the EC,' he said.

The index was off 185.14 at 19,423.88, its lowest since April 4, after a day's high of 19,654.33 and low of 19,331.37. Arbitrage buying lifted equities initially, but active sales in the afternoon by foreign and individual investors depressed prices. Profit-taking by institutional investors looking to cover their foreign exchange losses on overseas bond holdings, due to the recent appreciation of the yen against the dollar, also weighed on the index. Some shares regained ground on small-lot bargain hunting towards the end of the session. Investor confidence was dented, too, by the decline in privatisation issues. Individual investors and dealers, fearing a further fall in the market, took profits in early trading. Traders expect the next support point of the Nikkei 225 to be around the 19,111.92 posted on March 31, the final day of the last business year. Volume increased to 299m shares from 210m. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 16.99 to 1,533.28, while the Nikkei 300 shed 3.09 to 280.83. Declines led rises by 867 to 124, with 170 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 2.93 at 1,262.23. Japan Tobacco fell Y16,000 to Y994,000. Investors had been nervous over the stock dropping below Y1m, regarded as a psychological support level. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dipped Y29,000 to Y863,000 on active foreign selling, while East Japan Railways shed Y3,000 to Y475,000. Banks, which depend on unrealised gains on stockholdings to support their capital ratios, fell. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y60 to Y2,880. Large-capital stocks were sold in busy trading. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, lost Y4 at Y384 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y18 to Y752. In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 218.81 at 21,465.36 in volume of 44.3m shares. Roundup Morgan Stanley Asia added its voice to those reducing the weighting of Hong Kong equities. It lowered its allocation to a still overweight 35 per cent from 40 per cent in its Asia-Pacific model portfolio. The move came less than a week after HG Asia (Singapore) also recommended investors to trim allocations in Hong Kong. Morgan Stanley upgraded Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore but cut Australia's weighting to neutral. HONG KONG finished down but off lows on late futures-led demand after dipping on news of the Morgan Stanley move. The Hang Seng index lost 10.61 at 9,405.48 after touching 9,356.92. Turnover stayed thin, at a preliminary HKDollars 2.1bn. TAIPEI rose sharply on late buying in the electronics and financial sectors, although brokers said they expected prices to consolidate ahead of local government elections on December 3. The weighted index put on 101.79 or 1.6 per cent at 6,449.99. Turnover came to TDollars 41.15bn. SEOUL edged down in volatile trading as selling of financial shares and mid-priced blue chips alternated with buying of primary blue chips. The composite index closed 0.36 off at 1,138.39, after backing down from an all-time intraday high of 1,145.01. Most preferred stocks were sharply higher after the Securities Supervisory Board told listed companies and securities houses to buy back 3 per cent of their own companies' preferred stocks by the first quarter of 1995. SINGAPORE rebounded as institutional funds returned to buy blue chip banks and properties. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 17.39 to 2,344.40 as Salomon Brothers commented that Singapore's residential property market appeared due for a downward correction but the commercial market was on track for a cyclical upturn. BOMBAY's 30-share index ended 90.21 or 2.1 per cent lower at 4,205.68 on hectic selling by domestic and foreign mutual funds. Brokers noted a lack of liquidity as mutual funds, committed to investing in the partial privatisation of seven state-owned companies, held back from making fresh investments. KUALA LUMPUR continued to be weighed down by forced selling by investors unable to meet margin calls. The composite index declined 6.45 to 1,051.51. SYDNEY was pulled higher by strength in golds. The All Ordinaries index added 15.3 at 1,982.6 and turnover was ADollars 375.3m. Resources issue CRA rose 28 cents to ADollars 18.36.

The US government has revealed in a 200-page statement declassified on Monday that it detonated a nuclear bomb at its underground test site in the Nevada desert in 1962 using 'reactor-grade' plutonium from a UK reactor. The UK government has argued that plutonium from civil reactors does not pose a security threat because constructing a bomb from the fuel is extremely difficult. The UK's Department of Trade and Industry, which is responsible for British Nuclear Fuels, said yesterday: 'This test proves that it (using plutonium from reactors to make bombs) is possible. But our understanding is that the difficulties involved in practice were such that no one would really dream of trying it.' The plutonium used in the US test was derived from military work carried out by the UK Atomic Energy Authority at the Calder Hall reactor at Sellafield, the DTI said. BNF said yesterday: 'We have always said you need considerable skill to make bombs from reactor-grade plutonium, not that it is theoretically impossible'. But the Washington-based lobby group Nuclear Control Institute called on Britain to 'halt. . . needless production of weapon-usable plutonium'.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Sazhin]    [Text] Despite measures aimed at the development of  military industry and increasing the scale of research and  development in the defense sector, India depends on the import  of new technologies necessary for organizing production of  modern types of weapons and military equipment. Advanced models  of armament (main battle tank, light combat aircraft, helicopter  gunship, missile systems) being developed in the country are  largely based on foreign technologies. Thus, American or  British-made equipment and assemblies are being chosen for an  aircraft being created; a German power plant and transmission  and a number of other systems and assemblies are being chosen  for a tank being created.    Overseas purchases of necessary technologies and materials,  as well as combat equipment and weapons, are entrusted to the  Directorate of Supply and Deliveries of the Department of  Military Production and Deliveries of India's Ministry of  Defense.    The policy of import purchases being implemented by the  Ministry of Defense today is determined basically by the  economic feasibility of developing production of one or another  type of weapon by Indian industry. At the same time, recognizing  some technology or type of weapon as strategically important  gives ground for allocating practically any amount for their  acquisition.    Usually, technical committees organize comparative testing  in  addition to a preliminary study of models and technologies  planned to be purchased both in India and abroad. The decision  to purchase one or another model is made only after expert  examination or testing. Priority is given to technologies and  materials used in the missile industry, new variants of weapons  and military equipment, and spare parts for systems that are in  service in the Indian forces. The total volume of imports of  machine building products is distributed in the following manner  (in percent): 17 for ships and vessels; 16.6 for control and  measuring equipment; 13 for communications equipment; 12 for  construction equipment. In addition, it includes aviation  equipment, computers, boiler equipment, and parts and assemblies  for motor vehicles. Petroleum, petroleum products, and  petrochemical goods take up a considerable share in India's  import balance (15 percent). About $3 billion were spend for  these purposes in 1990. The percentage of steel and steel  products delivered to the country is not great (3 percent).    Large transactions for the purchase of import products  exceeding 10 million rupees ($40,000 U.S.) are approved by a  government body -- the Secretariat for Industrial  Authorizations. Ministries, other government organizations, and  private firms have the right to conclude agreements with foreign  firms for lesser amounts. Industrial enterprises are authorized  to import without licenses, drawings and technical documentation  at a cost of up to 2.5 million rupees. More than 2,000 requests  to purchase technologies abroad were submitted to the  Secretariat for Authorizations during 1991. In order to attract  foreign technologies, the government of India exempted from  licensing joint ventures of 25 branches of industry located in  backward areas of the country.    At the same time, in the last seven years, imports of  technologies virtually did not affect branches of industry  associated with the production of military products. Metallurgy,  electrical machine building, transportation machine building,  and the services sector accounted for about 70 percent of the  agreements on cooperation with foreign firms. On the whole, the  percentage of agreements on technology transfer increased from  19 percent in 1984 to 27 percent in 1991, and the volume of  foreign capital investments in the Indian economy increased  12-fold.    The main developers and transferrers of new technologies in  the country are: The Council for Scientific and Industrial  Research (includes 39 scientific institutes and laboratories and  also two scientific associations), six specialized departments  of the country's central government (science and technology,  atomic energy, space, electronics, development of the ocean,  environment, and ecology), organizations of defense research and  development of the Ministry of Defense, branch scientific  research centers of other ministries and departments, private  scientific research centers (the largest belong to the groups  Tata, Birla, Singhania, Sri Ram), specialized planning and  design firms, and scientific research and development offices  and laboratories of industrial enterprises of the state and  private sector. The state plays the main role in financing all  scientific research and development work, providing more than 85  percent of the expenditures for this purpose.    The following countries have agreements on the transfer of  technologies to India or joint ventures with India: the United  States, Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Great Britain, Japan,  France, Italy, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland,  Canada, Denmark, and also Hong Kong. Agreements were concluded  in 1991 in the amount of about 1.5 billion rupees (1.077 billion  in 1987). The number of agreements signed with American firms  has increased constantly: 148 in 1984, 189 in 1986, 217 in 1988,  and over 200 in 1990.    India's import-export policy at the current stage provides  for 944 positions on a list of products authorized for import  into the country under an open general license. This import  practice extends to the software sector and other technical  documentation in the field of information science. Duties on  imports of computer programs have decreased 60 percent, but at  the same time the maximum proportion of loan capital in capital  investments increased to 80 percent. (This indicator is accepted  as 60 percent for industry as a whole). For all types of goods,  there is a widespread practice of pre- and post-shipment  crediting of exports with a term of 6 months at the rate of 9.5  percent annually.    Today the Indian leadership is encountering considerable  difficulties in purchasing arms and military technologies abroad  that have strategic importance. Restrictions of the Coordinating  Committee (COCOM) for controlling exports of the latest  technologies from NATO countries and Japan apply to it. These  countries closely monitor to see that India's military industry  and army do not receive access to the latest weapon systems. In  addition, the West continues to be concerned that India does not  transfer the technologies it has and products produced using  them to third-party countries, primarily Russia and other CIS  states. There presently are at least 150 American monitors in  India monitoring observance of the provisions of the  Indian-American memorandum on technology transfer (1985). At the  same time, its leadership has more than once stated its desire  to accomplish this monitoring independently, since the  above-mentioned referendum does not contain any articles about  conducting this type of inspections.    Recently, this position by the Americans has led to certain  difficulties for India and Russia when executing a joint  transaction for the sale of cryogenic engines for missile  systems. Indian programs in the area of creating ballistic  missiles and also nuclear research are in obvious contradiction  with the aspirations of the leading countries of the West to  limit the proliferation of missile technologies in the world and  also to narrow the range of states possessing nuclear weapons.  At the same time, India advances the argument that its security  today can be ensured only if it has at its disposal weapons  which its neighboring states have.    India's successful testing of the ""Prithvi"" missile system  in  September 1992 makes it possible to assert that the country is  already able to produce missile weapons. This event caused  considerable concern in the West.    It is known that Soviet models of weapons and military  equipment account for 50 to 70 percent of the armament of the  Indian Army. According to the Indian press, its operation over a  considerable period has demonstrated sufficient reliability and  the necessary combat qualities. The simplicity of its servicing  is also noted, which is also quite important for this country's  army. Weapons received from the USSR underwent testing during  combat operations in 1965 and 1971, and during operations  conducted by Indian armed forces in Sri Lanka.    Maintaining the achieved level of military and  military-technical ties between Russia and India is important  for both sides. The sphere of their cooperation may be expanded  in the near future by the introduction of new forms in addition  to tested forms, new ones taking shape in modern-day Russia.

The survey of 527 private and public-sector companies also found that nearly two thirds of respondents predicted that the minimum wage would have no effect on pay differentials, while a further fifth expected a limited effect. A recent survey by the British Hospitality Association, which represents employers in hotels, restaurants and catering, calculated that a minimum wage would increase the wage bill by only 5.9 per cent, although that figure rose dramatically to 65.5 per cent if all differentials were maintained. On job losses, 85 per cent of managers did not foresee their organisation reducing staff. The Low Pay Unit says the abolition of wages councils, likely if the Conservatives win, would cost 25,000 jobs because of the drop in demand created by lower wages.

Analysts said the deal could be worth more than SKr2bn (Dollars 160.7m) on a debt-free basis. The move will end a century-long involvement by Nobel in the energy business and is in line with its strategy of focusing on core businesses. Akzo Nobel, formed this year through the merger of Sweden's Nobel Industries and Akzo of the Netherlands, has a 40 per cent stake in Njordkraft, which owns four medium-sized and three smaller hydro-power plants in Sweden with a combined production capacity of 940 gigawatt hours. The plants have traditionally met about 50 per cent of the group's Swedish energy needs. The remaining Njordkraft shares are held by financial investors, mainly pension funds and insurance groups. Akzo has options to purchase these shares next year, enabling Stockholm Energi to gain full control of the concern. Mr Dag Stromqvist, managing director of Eka Nobel, said: 'We are not in the power business. We are in the chemicals business.' He declined to disclose terms, saying talks were at an early stage. Stockholm Energi produces around 13 terawatt hours of electricity a year. Half its output is generated by nuclear power and 35 per cent by hydro-electric power.   Companies:-  Akzo Nobel.

The world's second largest vehicle maker hopes that the components operations will open the way for it to begin assembling vehicles in China in the near future. 'We are eager to establish vehicle assembly projects in China at the earliest opportunity,' Mr Frank Macher, Ford vice president and general manager of the automotive components division said yesterday. Ford signed an agreement yesterday with Shanghai Automation Instrumentation for the production of a range of automotive electronic components to supply vehicle makers both in China and in other Asian markets. A new plant is to be built in Shanghai with production scheduled to begin in June, 1986. Earlier this year Ford agreed joint ventures with Shanghai Automotive Industry for the production of plastic automotive components - output begins this month - and with Shanghai Yao Hua Glass Works for the production of automotive safety glass, which has already begun operations.

The new company, ABB Flexible Automation, will account for about 10 per cent of ABB's industrial systems and products segment. It represents another step by Zurich-based ABB to simplify its structure, save on administrative costs and boost its market presence. The former ABB Robotics claimed to be the world's largest supplier of robots and the paint finishing business was a leading supplier in the automotive paint systems market, worth about Dollars 2.5bn a year. Both have been expanding through organic growth and acquisitions of companies such as Trallfa and Ransburg. Mr Stelio Demark, president of the new company, said yesterday that, by merging the two businesses and exploiting their synergies, 'we are in a good position to improve the overall profitability of our businesses'. The merger will not lead to any job cuts, said Mr Roland Nordstrom, chief executive of the UK arm of ABB Flexible Automation.

That is the main conclusion of the monthly report on the German business mood published by the Munich-based Ifo institute. In contrast, the more optimistic mood of those manufacturers still in business in east Germany has worsened, with both the current business situation, and the outlook for the next six months, seen to be growing less favourable. The average level of order books in west German industry has dropped from 2.6 to 2.5 months' production since last December, while capacity utilisation has slipped from 80.5 to 78.5 per cent, the institute reports. Production plans for the coming three months in the west are being sharply reduced, but the expectation is for a continuing slowdown in price rises too. In primary product industries, such as chemicals, paper and cellulose manufacturers, the decline in pessimism was also reported, although not directly related to exports. Investment goods producers are more sanguine about export opportunities later in the year, although the overall mood remains extremely pessimistic. Orders remained at the same level as February. As for consumer durables, there was a stabilisation in orders for electrical goods, but a continuing decline in car orders, according to survey participants.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

The prime minister told executives at the British American Chambers of Commerce in New York that the government had set in place 'solid foundations for sustained growth throughout the 90s'. Manufacturing productivity was rising by more than 5 per cent a year, labour costs had fallen and the employment market was strengthening, he said. Britain was again expecting the fastest growth rate among the main European countries this year. Mr Major said there had been a fundamental change in working practices which had given Britain its lowest underlying inflation rate for a generation. 'The inflation psychology is, at last, in retreat. And I intend to keep it that way.' Emphasising that education remained at the top of his domestic political agenda, the prime minister said that long-term competitiveness would depend 'above all on the quality, the ability, the skills of our workforce'. Borrowing some of the recent political rhetoric of the Labour party, he said: 'What we are working for is nothing less than the re-skilling of Britain for the 21st century.' In a sideswipe against Japan, he said that Britain and the US should work together to open up Japan's markets to European and US competition.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Industrial collaboration will also be wound down, but co-operative projects already under way may be continued. Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda, and Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the management board of BMW, met in Tokyo yesterday for the first time since the German executive and luxury carmaker stunned Honda three weeks ago with its Pounds 800m deal to buy British Aerospace's 80 per cent stake in Rover. Honda said after the 90-minute meeting that it intended to end its 'mutual equity holding relationship' with the Rover group, which was taken in 1990. Honda currently holds a 20 per cent stake in Rover's vehicle operations (including Land Rover), while Rover holds a 20 per cent stake in Honda of the UK Manufacturing, the Japanese carmaker's Pounds 370m car and engine assembly plant at Swindon, Wiltshire. Honda made clear yesterday that in the long term it intended to wind down its collaboration with Rover, which dates from 1979, although it left the way open for existing co-operative projects such as the production of the Rover 600/Honda Accord and the Rover 200/400/Honda Concerto to be continued. In a statement, Mr Kawamoto said: 'The series of contracts now existing between Honda and Rover will be reviewed in future business discussions. 'In the future we intend to create a more independent operation in Europe, using our own resources,' he added. In London, Mr John Russell, managing director of Rover International, emphasised that Rover believed there would be no changes in existing collaboration agreements or component supply arrangements. He expected that project HH/Theta, Honda's and Rover's respective replacements for the current Honda Concerto/Rover 200-400, would also go ahead as planned. Production has been scheduled to start in the autumn. Yesterday's meeting in Tokyo, which included Mr John Towers, Rover managing director, had taken place in a 'friendly' atmosphere, said Mr Pischetsrieder. While Honda would not reveal details of the talks, it emphasised that its decision to sever the equity links had been based on what BMW had brought to the negotiating table at the meeting. 'This time we listened to what BMW had to say and then told them what our intention was,' Honda said. Terminating its equity relationship with Rover was one of several options Honda had been considering until yesterday's meeting, it added. BMW said that the 20 per cent cross shareholdings between Rover and Honda's UK manufacturing subsidiary would be swapped, leaving it in 100 per cent control of Rover. In addition, it would make a cash payment of around Pounds 30m to Honda under the terms of the original 1990 share exchange agreement. Mr Tony Woodley, of the TGWU union, said the relationship between Honda and Rover appeared to be 'dead'. Meanwhile, Sir Teddy Taylor, the Conservative MP for Southend East, called on the government to apologise to Honda for the 'scandalous' way it had been treated. Sir Teddy commented: 'It seems to me it was scandalous to sell off the company to this ailing German giant for a small fortune without even consulting Honda.' Mr Robin Cook, Labour shadow trade and industry secretary, said the deal could 'throw up serious problems for the existing Rover model range and will undoubtedly create problems for the future development of Rover'. Ministers must ensure 'that Rover and its workforce will not suffer from the takeover'.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE ROVER-HONDA LINKS - HOW MANY WILL SURVIVE?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

'We can provide many advanced technologies for lower fees than the western countries,' Mr Nikolai N. Ponomarev Stepnoi, president of the Russian Nuclear Society, said. Mr Stepnoi was in Seoul as a guest speaker at the seventh annual meeting of the Korea Atomic Industrial Forum and the Korea Nuclear Society. He also met South Korean officials, including Energy-Resources Minister Jin Nyum. Mr Stepnoi said he had offered to sell technology or conduct joint research with South Korea on certain projects, including extension of the life of nuclear power plants, and that South Korean officials responded favourably. 'We can expect to make substantial achievements before long,' Mr Stepnoi said. South Korea relies heavily on nuclear power, obtaining nearly 50 per cent of its electricity from nine nuclear power plants. Two more plants are being built and several more are to be added by the year 2000. No Russian technology has been used in any South Korean plants so far.

Led by Fu Kuang-yen, secretary-general of the Taiwan Gourmet  Powder Industrial Association, the group comprises a dozen  senior business executives.    Group members include Secretary-General Shen Ta of the  Taiwan  Association of Frozen Food Industries, Secretary-General Wang  Yuan-chuan of the Taiwan Regional Association of Carbonated  Beverage Industries, and Secretary-General Shih Fu-yuan of the  Taiwan Association of Frozen Vegetable and Fruit Manufacturers.    Taiwan and the Philippines are jointly building a  325-hectare  industrial park in Subic Bay, and Lu said Taiwan investors could  use the site as a production base from which they could sell  foodstuffs to neighboring Vietnam and Singapore, whose residents  have a taste for Chinese food.    The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei on Tuesday.    Meanwhile, Vice Chairman Wu Kuan-hsiung of the China  External  Trade Development Council (CETRA) will head a mission to the  Philippines and Indonesia beginning April 24.    Wu said the CETRA mission will go to Subic Bay and to Batam,  Medan, Surabaya, and Jakarta in Indonesia to seek trade and  investment opportunities for Taiwan's machinery manufacturers.    The visits of the two delegations are regarded as part of  domestic investors' efforts to push for increased investments in  Southeast Asian countries in response to the government's  southern strategy.

The call came from Tsunesaburo Nishimura, president of the  Japan Society of Industrial Machinery Manufacturers, in a  meeting of industry leaders with International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai.    Nishimura said the industry is concerned about the yen's  renewed surge against the dollar following the breakdown in  February of the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks.    The Japanese currency's excessive strength may undermine the  industry's cost-cutting and other restructuring efforts, he said.    Nishimura and nine other industrial leaders, each  representing machinery manufacturing for such sectors as  engineering, construction, textiles and robots, jointly made the  request to Kumagai during consultations over breakfast.    The machinery industry hopes the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry (MITI) will ensure the trade dispute does not  deal a blow to its earnings, which are just recovering in some  sectors from the long recession, said Nishimura, who is also an  adviser to Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd.    Kumagai said MITI will do its best to have the request  reflected in its policy.    Nishimura said some bright spots are being seen in such  sectors as semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, machines for  making housing materials and waste disposal machinery.    But construction machinery, a major leading indicator for  Japan's economy, is still in the doldrums, he said.     "

The company, based in Clevedon, Avon, utilises 'vortex technology', the principles of which have been known since Roman times. The vortex, or whirlpool, effect is harnessed to regulate fluid flow. The company has two main product ranges: flow control valves for flood protection and storm control and hydro-dynamic separators for separating solids from liquids, especially in the treatment of sewage and other waste water. All are patented and low-cost. Hydro expects recent environmental legislation in Europe and the US, which has specified big cuts in pollutant discharge, to increase capital works in its markets. The company is raising about Pounds 3.7m, of which Pounds 570,000 will go to existing shareholders. The balance is for research and development, international expansion and the development of new markets. The directors are retaining between 60 and 65 per cent of the equity. The board is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 480,000 for the year to December 31. In 1993 it made Pounds 156,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.1m, and in the six months to June 30, profits were Pounds 154,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.4m.   Companies:-  Hydro International.

Manufacturing was down  25 percent, reproduction of materials 13.4 percent, and  production of consumer goods fell by 6.3 percent. This was  stated by Svetlana Antonovska, director of the Institute of  Statistics, at a press conference in Skopje today. A drop in  industrial production was recorded in 27 branches representing  86.3 percent of the overall industrial production. A  particularly sharp drop was recorded in ferrous metallurgy, in  heavy machinery construction, in transport manufacturing, shoe  and leather goods manufacturing, and in the printing, clothes,  and food industries.    According to Antonovska, in the same period the value of  construction works completed on the territory of the Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia dropped by 35.7 percent. During  this period, Macedonia's exported $234 million worth of goods  and materials, a drop of 13 percent from last year. At the same  time, imports rose 8.7 percent, for a total value of $202  million.    Further declines were noted in retail, catering, tourism,  traffic and other sectors. Total employment fell by 6.8  percent; overall, there are 404,786 people in the labor force.  Unemployment increased 2.5 percent to a total of 178,789  people. Retail prices rose 36.6 percent between December last  year and April this year. Moreover, the cost of living rose  43.9 percent, Antonovska said.     "

The bullion price's descent below Dollars 380 an ounce took the gold shares index 19 lower to 1,904. Industrial shares, however, remained buoyant, led by strong overseas demand for Iscor, the steelmaker which produced unexpectedly good half-year results last week. The stock lost 2 cents on the day at R2.86 but the industrial index climbed 46 to 5,679. The contradictory set of circumstances facing investors was dominated in mid-week by initial confidence and then disillusionment with the degree of progress in talks between the African National Congress and the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party. The weak gold bullion price and falling global markets also contributed to instability, but deal-ers reported steady, if more subdued, demand from over-seas investors for blue chip issues. Mr Mike Brown at the stockbrokers, Frankel, Pollak, Vinderine, said that local institutions were proving strangely hesistant, still weighing up the shift in market sentiment at the end of 1993, brought on by the wave of foreign buying which changed notions of value on the JSE. Overseas investors could be forgiven for a wait-and-see approach as elections loomed, but local fund managers might be missing out on an opportunity to pick up good value scrip before another bout of foreign investment.

Applications mailed through the U.S. Postal Service or a   commercial delivery service will be ``on time'' if they are   received or postmarked on or before December 9, 1994.   Submissions by facsimile (fax) transmission will not be   accepted. Applications that do not meet the above criteria   will be considered late applications. Respondents are   cautioned that if their application is late, it will be   returned without review.       V. Method of Selection and Evaluation Criteria       All Phase I and Phase II grant applications will be   evaluated and judged on a competitive basis. Applications   will be screened, and those found to be inadequate for   review or programmatically unrelated to HCFA's mission will   be returned to the applicant. Those passing the screening   will be reviewed for technical and scientific merit. Each   application will be judged individually, as described in   this section. HCFA is under no obligation to fund any   application or make any specific number of awards in a given   topic area. It may also elect to fund no projects within a   given topic area.       A. Review Process       Grant applications are subject to a review process   involving two sequential steps. The first step is performed   by a technical review panel composed primarily of Federal   and non-Federal professionals selected for their competence   in particular fields. The task of the panel is to evaluate   applications for scientific and technical merit. The   reviewers furnish a number rating, make an overall   recommendation, and, on occasion, make highly specific   recommendations related to the scope, direction, and conduct   of the proposed research. The second level of review is   made by the senior management of HCFA's ORD. ORD management   decisions are based on judgments about not only the   technical merit of the proposed research, but also its   relevance to our mission. Generally, HCFA may award a grant   only if the corresponding application has been recommended   for approval by the panel. However, applications   recommended for approval are not automatically funded.       B. Review Criteria       In considering the scientific and technical merit of   each application, the following criteria and weights will be   used:   The soundness and technical merit of the proposed   approach_35 percent.   The potential of the research for technological   innovation including the potential for commercial   application_30 percent.   The qualifications of the proposed principal   investigator, support staff, and consultant_20 percent.   The appropriateness of the budget_10 percent.   The adequacy and suitability of the facilities and   research environment_5 percent.       C. Funding Decisions       When making funding decisions, ORD takes into   consideration the following: (1) ratings resulting from the   technical evaluation process, (2) program relevance, and   (3) applications.       D. Release of Grant Application Review Information       Following decisions on grant applications, summary   statements are mailed with a disapproval letter to principal   investigators whose proposals have not been accepted.       E. Submission of Similar Grant Applications by the   Applicant Organization       HCFA discourages the submission of more than one grant   application submitted by the same applicant organization   with essentially the same research focus: That is, a   product or technology that, with nonsubstantive   modifications, can be applied to a variety of purposes. In   evaluating groupings of applications with a common   scientific focus or objective, technical review groups are   in a position to easily identify multiple grant applications   from the same organization for essentially the same project.   In these cases, HCFA will give funding consideration to only   one application.       VI. Considerations       SBA's SBIR Program Policy Directive (58 FR 6144)   specifies that we furnish the following information:       A. Awards       There will be approximately 10 to 15 Phase I and/or   Phase II awards in FY '95.            "

The 225-issue average gained 103.51 at 20,173.42, having opened at the day's low of 20,054.21 before rising to the high for the session of 20,221.72 in late morning trading. Volume amounted to 224m shares, against 206m. Traders said investors would remain quiet until Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's political reform bill passed through parliament. 'Once the bill is approved, the government will be able to concentrate on measures to boost the economy,' said one Japanese broker. Overall falls retained a narrow lead over advances by 494 to 483, with 195 issues unchanged, but the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 3.40 to 1,647.86. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 0.73 at 1,286.54. Dealers said the Nikkei index has been stunted for the past few weeks due to selling by corporate investors, with small-lot buying support only coming from public funds and arbitrageurs. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said: 'Companies are expected to sell about Y1,000bn during the remainder of the fiscal year to March.' Among the large-capital stocks, Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, firmed Y1 to Y332 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y4 at Y679. High-technology exporters were bought as beneficiaries of the yen's recent easing against the dollar. Sony advanced Y70 to Y4,830 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y10 to Y1,510. Heiwa, the pachinko pinball machine maker listed on the second section which is currently under police investigation, fell Y500 to Y3,450. Other leisure-related stocks were also weak, with Sega Enterprises down Y120 to Y9,750. Telecom linked shares continued to sag on profit-taking. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone slipped Y10,000 to Y884,000, and Fujitsu was off Y2 at Y861. Railway linked stocks were higher ahead of the listing of East Japan Railway next Tuesday. Nippon Signal rose Y40 to Y1,550 and Keihin Electric Express Railway Y18 to Y753. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 43.83 to 22,156.12 in volume of 20.3m shares. Roundup MANY of the Pacific Rim markets continued to consolidate. HONG KONG finished modestly ahead after a session that had seen the Hang Seng index swing between a 120-point deficit and a 100-point gain. The index finished 41.39 higher at 8,902.80 in turnover that shrank to HKDollars 7.29bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 9.55bn. Mr Michael Paterson of Asia Equity commented that blue chips had been overbought and the market was broadening out into second liners and derivative instruments which had been left behind in the recent bull run. He thought that the current correction was very healthy, adding that he did not see the index moving upwards very far from its current level for the time being. HSBC, which topped the actives list, was down 50 cents at HKDollars 87, after slipping to a low of HKDollars 86 following news of a provision for its Samuel Montagu unit. AUSTRALIA pulled back to close weaker as profits were booked for the second consecutive day, and the All Ordinaries index finished 23.8 lower at 2,051.7 in turnover of ADollars 412.2m. The All Industrials index fell 35.7 to 3,179.6 and the All Resources 14.8 to 1,190.1. BHP ended 22 cents cheaper at ADollars 17.40, while News Corp retreated 40 cents, or 3.4 per cent, to ADollars 11.26. SEOUL was lower in continued reaction to recent advances, but renewed interest in some shares with low price-to-book ratios neutralised much of an early decline. The composite stock index lost a net 2.61 at 738.63 in turnover of Won564.45bn. TAIWAN saw late selling after a minor technical rally and the weighted index ended 11.86 off at 3,958.32 in turnover that fell to TDollars 19.52bn. SINGAPORE was easier on profit-taking, with sell-offs in selected index shares and some speculative issues dragging the market lower. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 12.42 down at 2,095.84, near the day's low of 2,093.07. NEW ZEALAND lost ground, the NZSE-Capital index shedding 11.91 to 2,060.25. Telecom, still suffering from Merrill Lynch's change of recommendation on the stock, declined 7 cents to NZDollars 4.28. MANILA, however, resumed its climb after Tuesday's respite, and the composite index appreciated 46.79 to a record 2,205.78. KARACHI kept up its forward momentum with a gain in the KSE-100 index of 28.14 to 1,478.57, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. The market was helped by the victory of Ms Benazir Bhutto's PPP party in forming the government in the Punjab, Pakistan's largest and wealthiest province.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

According to the minister, the two countries are no longer  working on the basis that the law will be approved by 28  February, the date with which the United States is working to  decide whether it begins a policy of retaliation.    Amorim on 7 February met in Itamaraty with Science and  Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas; Industry, Commerce, and  Tourism Minister Elcio Alvares; and Culture Minister Luis  Roberto do Mascimento e Silva. Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao,  president of the Industrial Property National Institute (INPI  [Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial]); Paulo Tarso  Flecha, ambassador to Washington; and his colleague, Jose Arthur  Denot Madeiros, who last week headed a meeting with the U.S.  Government.    The meeting was held on 6 February in order to discuss  government ideas regarding the topics discussed in Washington.  The foreign minister's evaluation indicates that the meeting  with the North Americans was a failure. ""There was progress in  the aspect of wanting to reach an agreement regarding the points  that merit a more profound study,"" he said. Amorim said it  would be ""easy"" to say that there is not a risk that sanctions  will be applied, but he considers as ""reasonable"" the  expectation that the United States will close the case on 28  February. The minister is still considering whether he will  travel to Washington to give the negotiations a political jolt.    According to one of the participants in yesterday's meeting,  it will be difficult to reach an agreement between the two  countries. The points of disagreement surpass the points on  which there is agreement. During a news conference on 7  February, the minister himself cited just one point that the two  countries have in common: The computer program software  [preceding word in English] must be protect by authorship rights  like literary works. The major disagreement lies in the fact  that the text concerning intellectual property contained in the  GATT's Uruguayan Round Accord, which closed in December, is  ambiguous"" [no beginning quotation mark as published].    Thus, for example, Brazil understands that the GATT's text  considers that a patent can only be exploited when the product  is manufactured locally. But the United States feels the  opposite -- that the patent can be exploited through imports  without the obligation of manufacturing the product patented in  the country.    Another disagreement refers to parallel imports: The United  States wants the patent holder to have the right to block  parallel imports, in other words, those imports that are made  without the authorization of the patent holder. The Uruguay  Round Accord does not mention this point, but the amendment the  Brazilian Government intends to send to the Senate restricts the  scope of the type of patent protection the United States wants  because parallel imports would only be possible between member  countries of a common market or based on international  agreements such as Mercosur. This means, for example, that a  person in Argentina who has the license for a product with the  patent holder living in the United States could supply the  product in a parallel form to Brazil without the patent holder's  direct authorization.    There is also disagreement regarding the ""pipeline""  [preceding word in English], or transitory protection. The  United States wants a ""pipeline"" [preceding word in English]  that protects products already patented in other countries and  already being commercialized for the same period of time for  which the products are patented in the country of origin. The  government is going to suggest an amendment to Draft Law No.  115/93 that will authorize the protection of the ""pipeline""  [preceding word in English] only for those patents that have  been registered abroad, but not for products that already are  being commercialized.    The Uruguayan Round text does not clearly define the state  of  microorganisms and living beings, but the United States  considers that they should be patentable, giving as examples the  super tomato that has been developed in a laboratory and the  Harvard University rat that has been genetically altered [rato  transgenico de Harvard], which is used to test products against  mammary cancer.    The draft bill indicates that Brazil's position is that of  granting a patent only for microorganisms (not living beings)  that are used in industrial processes.    The Brazilian Government is trying to close the gap between  the two countries' positions. Ambassador Paulo Tarso Flecha de  Lima will continue to be Brazil's contact with the U.S.  Government. He departed for Washington on 7 February.    Senator Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PA [Brazilian Democratic  Movement  Party-Para State]) is the new rapporteur for the industrial  property draft bill. He will try to present his argument on 16  February to the Senate's Economic Affairs Committee.     "

The researchers - who include Mr Sig Prais, the institute's senior research fellow - say practical subjects taught in schools can lay the foundation for vocational training and the acquisition of industrial skills. Schools in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands use practical subjects such as woodwork, technical drawing and domestic science to instil basic work skills. These include care, precision, perseverance and responsibility. In England teaching of these subjects has been replaced with the technology syllabus of the national curriculum. The report says this syllabus places strong emphasis on creativity and imagination at the expense of basic skills. The English syllabus devotes much of the pupil's time to speculating and writing about a general theme, the report says. In the European countries studied, school time was largely devoted to the making of useful objects working from precise drawings. Earlier studies by the institute have shown that the shortage of craft skills is the principal deficiency of British industry when compared with European competitors.

Sales in the whole of Germany were up 3 per cent, 2 per cent higher than in December. The increase was led by a 14 per cent year-on-year rise in sales of cars and components. Pharmaceuticals sales were up 11 per cent, and home furnishings 9 per cent. There was a 1 per cent drop in sales of food, drink and tobacco, and a 4 per cent fall in textiles, clothing and shoes. Overall economic activity in Germany 'increased noticeably' around the turn of the year, the economics ministry said. The ministry cited growing foreign demand, 'lively' housebuilding and 'further clear progress' in eastern Germany's recovery as factors underlying this resurgence. Russia's industrial output rose 2.3 per cent in February from January, but was 24.1 per cent below the level of a year earlier, the sharpest drop since start of reforms in 1992. Some 4,280 enterprises shut down some or all production last month. Spanish industrial producer prices rose 1.1 per cent in January, compared with a 0.2 per cent rise in December and 0.8 per cent in January 1993.

To go by the number on record as having actually done so, however, it's rarer than the transformation of water into wine. The latest claimant is Professor Ilya Varshavsky of Moscow's Institute of Theoretical Engineering.  'Beneath our feet is an inexhaustible supply of fuel,' he says, referring to sand as a source of silicon. Apparently, if a pinch of the latter is popped into the water-filled reactor fitted to his Moskvitch limo, hey presto: out comes hydrogen to power the car. 'The basic research has already been done,' he told an interviewer from the Russian Information Agency, expressing confidence that the process will be widely used in everything from 'cars to the construction of a lunar base'. Unfortunately, when Observer's colleague in Moscow called the institute for clarification, he was told everyone was on holiday. Nor is the FT's science correspondent entirely happy with the idea, saying that it's impossible to see how silicon can generate hydrogen from water without an energy source. One possibility would be a sun-powered photovoltaic cell made from silicon which can produce electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Even so, the device would at best be of little use during during Russia's long bleak winter.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.   Industries:-  P2869  Industrial Organic Chemicals, NEC.

The forecast, while sharply down on the Dollars 44.3m of net earnings recorded in 1991, is in line with industry estimates. Revenues were expected to rise above Dollars 540m for 1992, compared to Dollars 515.9m in 1991, according to Mr Kirk Raab, president and chief executive of the company. Mr Raab said 1993 revenues could reach Dollars 560m. The company's last reported earnings - for the third quarter of 1992 - showed a 43 per cent drop in net income to Dollars 7.7m. Revenues in the third quarter were 2 per cent improved at Dollars 137.3m. Genentech's net profits for the first nine months of 1992 amounted to Dollars 14.6m, down from Dollars 44.2m in the same period of 1991. Revenues for the first nine months were Dollars 402.3m, up from Dollars 396.4m. Mr Raab attributed the expected 1992 earnings decline to flat sales of Activase, the heart disease drug, and a steep rise in spending on research and development. Among the most expensive research projects are the clinical trials of Activase and a related product for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

The turnaround in technology transfers, which had declined  since 1989, reflects the business recovery in Korea, according  to the ""Annual Report on Technology Introduction"" issued  recently by the Korea Industrial Technology Association.    The annual report analyzed last year's technology  introduction, finding that the electric and electronic sector  led the way with 238 cases (33.6 percent), followed by 206 cases  for the machinery area (29.1) and 91 cases for the chemical  field (12.8).    In terms of royalties paid for technology transfers, the  electric and electronic sector came first with 54.2 percent,  trailed by the mechanical and chemical fields with 22.8 percent  and 12.55 percent, respectively. The most conspicuous rise  occurred in the construction sector with 28 cases worth 14.46  million dollars compared with three cases totaling 7.35 million  dollars in the previous year.    By country, Japan ranked first with 285 cases (40.3  percent),  followed by the United States (31.6 percent), Britain (5.15  percent) and Germany (4.3 percent).    The report said Korea's reliance on American and Japanese  technology declined as Japan, in particular, is avoiding  transfer of its advanced technology.    However, technology imports from former communist countries  such as Russia rose to 17 cases from five in the previous year,  indicating that technical cooperation with these states is  becoming more active.

The HSE said the study 'did provide some weak support for the associations . . . between pre-conception radiation dose to the fathers and the risk of leukaemia in their children'. The executive said the excess leukaemia cases were confined almost entirely to the children of men who started work at Sellafield before 1965, when workplace exposures were more than five times higher than today. 'There is no need for preventive action to protect the health of the Sellafield workforce other than the measures in place,' said Mr Eddie Varney, deputy chief inspector of nuclear installations. The report was published yesterday, two weeks after the conclusion of a High Court test case in which British Nuclear Fuels, Sellafield's operator, was cleared of causing leukaemia in two children through their fathers' radiation exposure. The judge said there was insufficient scientific evidence for such a link. Mr Martyn Day, the families' solicitor, said the report would provide 'very strong grounds' for an appeal, which is under consideration. But he was 'concerned about the very negative interpretation which the HSE is putting on its own findings'.   Companies:-  British Nuclear Fuels.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Zinc-plated lug nuts, finished or unfinished, and stainless-steel capped lug nuts are not in the scope of this review. Chrome-plated lock nuts are also not in the scope of this review.    During the POR, chrome-plated lug nuts were provided for under subheading 7318.16.00.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this review is dispositive.        Best Information Available        Based on information gathered while on verification, the Department determined that the data submitted by Gourmet for this review are unverifiable because the response Gourmet submitted was based on an ``in-house'' accounting system that could not be reconciled to an audited financial statement.    Reliance on the accounting system used for the preparation of the audited financial statements is a key and vital part of the Department's determination that a company's constructed value data are credible. An ``in-house'' system which has not been audited and is not used for the preparation of the financial statements or for any purpose other than internal deliberations of the company does not assure the Department that such costs have been stated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or that all costs have been appropriately captured by the ``in-house'' system (see Final Determination at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products and Certain Cut-To-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Korea, 58 FR 37186 (July 9, 1993)). Since Gourmet's ``in-house'' system cannot be relied upon due to numerous deficiencies (see Use of BIA, and Middleman dumping allegation memo to Holly Kuga, Director, Office of Antidumping Compliance), the Department has determined to apply BIA to Gourmet's sales in the POR, pursuant to Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act.    Chu Fong and San Chien both failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire. Accordingly, we are applying BIA to their entries.    In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations provide that the Department may take into account whether a party refuses to provide requested information (19 CFR 353.37(b)). Thus, the Department may determine, on a case-by-case basis, what constitutes BIA. For the purposes of these preliminary results, we applied the following two tiers of BIA where we were unable to use a company's response for purposes of determining a dumping margin (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of Antifriction Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, et al., 58 FR 39739, July 26, 1993):           1. When a company refuses to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impedes these proceedings, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest of the rates found for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin in the less than fair value investigation (LTFV) or prior administrative reviews: or (2) the highest rate found in this review for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin.    2. When a company substantially cooperates with our requests for information and, substantially cooperates in verification, but fails to provide the information requested in a timely manner or in the form required or was unable to substantiate it, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review or if the firm has never before been investigated or reviewed, the all others rate from the LTFV investigation; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for the class or kind of merchandise for any firm from the same country of origin.           Therefore, for parties refusing to respond, Chu Fong and San Chien, the first-tier BIA rate we applied in these preliminary results is 10.67 percent, which is the highest rate the Department found in the original LTFV investigation, Gourmet provided us with responses to our questionnaires, however the information on the record was unverifiable. Accordingly, we applied the second-tier BIA rate of 6.47 percent. This rate represents the highest rate ever applicable to Gourmet.    King Kong Corporation received the ``all other'' rate because the Department attempted, but could not locate, an address for it.        Preliminary Results of Review        We have preliminarily determined that the following margins exist for the period April 18, 1991, through August 31, 1992:                1Manufacturer/exporter  1Margin (percent)          Gourmet Equipment (Taiwan) Corporation  6.47    Chu Fong Metallic Industrial Works Co, Ltd  10.67  San Chien Industrial Works, Ltd  10.67  King Kong Corporation  6.93          The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.

Since Gourmet's ``in-house'' system cannot be relied upon due to numerous deficiencies (see Use of BIA, and Middleman dumping allegation memo to Holly Kuga, Director, Office of Antidumping Compliance), the Department has determined to apply BIA to Gourmet's sales in the POR, pursuant to Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act.    Chu Fong and San Chien both failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire. Accordingly, we are applying BIA to their entries.    In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations provide that the Department may take into account whether a party refuses to provide requested information (19 CFR 353.37(b)). Thus, the Department may determine, on a case-by-case basis, what constitutes BIA. For the purposes of these preliminary results, we applied the following two tiers of BIA where we were unable to use a company's response for purposes of determining a dumping margin (see Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review of Antifriction Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, et al., 58 FR 39739, July 26, 1993):           1. When a company refuses to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impedes these proceedings, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest of the rates found for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin in the less than fair value investigation (LTFV) or prior administrative reviews: or (2) the highest rate found in this review for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin.    2. When a company substantially cooperates with our requests for information and, substantially cooperates in verification, but fails to provide the information requested in a timely manner or in the form required or was unable to substantiate it, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review or if the firm has never before been investigated or reviewed, the all others rate from the LTFV investigation; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for the class or kind of merchandise for any firm from the same country of origin.           Therefore, for parties refusing to respond, Chu Fong and San Chien, the first-tier BIA rate we applied in these preliminary results is 10.67 percent, which is the highest rate the Department found in the original LTFV investigation, Gourmet provided us with responses to our questionnaires, however the information on the record was unverifiable. Accordingly, we applied the second-tier BIA rate of 6.47 percent. This rate represents the highest rate ever applicable to Gourmet.    King Kong Corporation received the ``all other'' rate because the Department attempted, but could not locate, an address for it.        Preliminary Results of Review        We have preliminarily determined that the following margins exist for the period April 18, 1991, through August 31, 1992:                1Manufacturer/exporter  1Margin (percent)          Gourmet Equipment (Taiwan) Corporation  6.47    Chu Fong Metallic Industrial Works Co, Ltd  10.67  San Chien Industrial Works, Ltd  10.67  King Kong Corporation  6.93          The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Upon completion of this review, the Department will issue appraisement instructions concerning all respondents directly to the U.S. Customs Service.     "

The Akatsuki Maru, carrying one ton of plutonium destined for a trial fast-breeder reactor, entered a purpose-built port at Tokai, which is near the nuclear research plant and is about 120km north-east of the Japanese capital, after one of the longest non-stop voyages by a commercial ship. It was ringed by a dozen coastguard vessels, and a boat chartered by Greenpeace, the environmental group, trailed nearby. On shore 2,000 police prepared for protests planned by anti-nuclear activists who claim the voyage has been dangerous and unnecessary. During the Akatsuki Maru's journey, about 10 countries warned Japan that the vessel should not enter their territorial waters and complained about being left in the dark about the cargo's potential dangers. The sustained criticism prompted the government to hint that plans to import about 30 tons of plutonium this decade would be reconsidered. The high security on the voyage was in response to concerns that the load could be a target for terrorists seeking to build nuclear weapons. However, the voyage was incident-free, apart from a dispute with a vessel owned by Greenpeace. About 70 vessels from the Maritime Safety Agency will secure the port during the unloading of the vessel. Unloading of the 15 containers holding the plutonium is expected to last until tomorrow morning.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.   Industries:-  P4953  Refuse Systems.

Last summer, Clark sold its lift truck business to Terex, the US industrial and construction machinery group, for Dollars 90m. The sale prompted considerable interest among investors about Clark's future plans. Mr Frank Sims, Clark's senior vice-president, said in London yesterday that Clark was looking at companies worth around Dollars 100m in businesses which would fit with Clark's current range. 'It would be a mid-sized company to which we could add value,' he said. There were a surprising number of opportunities among private companies, or divisions of big corporations, he said. The acquisition was more likely to be in the US, to balance costs such as retiree health expenses. Clark has all but completed a big programme of investment in its manufacturing base, but Mr Sims stressed that it intended to be patient in its search for a takeover. It could, alternatively, do 'bolt-on' acquisitions for its present businesses. Clark's 1992 results will be out next week. Its main problem is the unconsolidated VME, which has been hit by the construction equipment recession worldwide and is undergoing a restructuring. Clark's share in VME's nine-month loss was Dollars 40.7m. Mr Sims said he was cautiously optimistic for 1993, with business conditions improving in the US.   Companies:-  Clark Equipment.

Lin Chuei-chou, president of the Industrial Technology  Research Institute (ITRI), said at the opening ceremony that  scholars and experts from both sides of the Taiwan Strait could  use the meeting as a basis for more contacts and exchanges.    The two-day seminar is sponsored by the ITRI, China Steel  Corp. and COMMERCIAL TIMES newspaper and will focus on steel,  materials and intellectual property rights.    A 24-member mainland delegation, headed by Zhou Guangzhao,  president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, arrived in Taiwan  Sunday to participate in the seminar.    Besides members of the academy, the delegation also included  officials of leading steel companies in the mainland.    Zhou said upon his arrival that he hoped cross-strait  sci-tech exchanges would cover not just basic, applied and  industrial science, but nuclear science as well.    The head of the mainland's highest research institute also  said he was happy to see cross-strait exchanges have increased  in the past few years.    Zhou revealed that 10 Taiwan scientists will board a  mainland  research ship in April to conduct research in the South China  Sea.    He also noted that Taiwan has more experience with nuclear-  generated electricity, and he believed the mainland could learn  from the experience.

The ministry of finance is determined to proceed at its own glacial pace. This is no big bang. Sumitomo has been excluded for reasons of semantics, and the successful candidates will only be allowed to participate in corporate bonds, not equities. The slow march to liberalisation is partly explained by a bureaucracy's unwillingness to yield power. Liberalisation, conceived in the heady days of late 1980s, is also difficult to implement in the depths of recession. The ministry also wants to avoid a rush of casualties among the securities houses. Yesterday's development is still significant. The big four brokers, Nomura, Nikko, Daiwa and Yamaichi, will scarcely be troubled. Similarly the long-term credit banks, such as the Industrial Bank of Japan, have had time to establish successful bond operations. However, prospects for second tier brokers are bleak. The five commercial banks need to compensate for the decline in their traditional corporate lending operations by aggressively pursuing bond business. Smaller brokers will struggle to compete. Some may need rescuing. This would be a natural price for the ministry to exact, if it is eventually to let commercial banks into the equity market too. Daiwa's rescue of Cosmo Securities provides the model. When that happens the big four may face real competition.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

The Goldsmith Foundation, set up by Sir James and his brother Edward, yesterday said it would pay part of Greenpeace's legal costs if the pressure group lost the case. The Goldsmiths have backed several anti-nuclear campaigns. Lord Melchett, director of Greenpeace UK, said Greenpeace could call on 'more than Pounds 100,000' from the foundation if it lost the court battle. 'I think he has backed us because he feels, as we do, that we have a strong case and that it is possible to stop Thorp,' said Lord Melchett. Greenpeace has raised Pounds 205,000 towards its costs from a special appeal to its supporters. The government announced its decision to give the go-ahead to the Pounds 2.8bn plant before Christmas. The licence came into effect on January 17, but the plant is not expected to become fully radioactive until mid-February. Greenpeace will bring a High Court challenge to the decision on February 7. The pressure group lost an earlier court attempt in September to stop testing of the plant.

We also reject AIDE's proposal to make bidding credits and other special provisions available to all designated entities bidding on all of the broadband PCS frequency blocks (not just the C and F blocks). Our existing approach of limiting these special provisions to the entrepreneurs' blocks, coupled with changes we are making today are narrowly tailored to meet Congress' objective of ensuring that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in broadband PCS. The record does not support broadening this relief to include additional frequency blocks, nor is there substantial support for broadening the availability of special provisions generally.    16. Similarly, we do not accept GTE's argument that we should do away with the entrepreneurs' blocks and instead offer bidding credits as well as other special provisions across all broadband PCS frequency blocks. As we already explained in the     Fifth Report and Order    , in our judgment we do not anticipate designated entities to realize meaningful opportunities for participation in broadband PCS unless we supplement bidding credits and other special provisions with a limitation on the size of the entities designated entities will bid against. Without the insulation of the entrepreneurs' block, the record strongly supports the conclusion that measures such as bidding credits will prove ineffective for broadband PCS. We also disagree with GTE's contention that our entrepreneurs' block plan unduly restricts the ability of cellular carriers to provide PCS. We believe that the public interest benefits of establishing an entrepreneurs' block outweigh the need to provide additional opportunities for cellular operators as GTE describes. Moreover, our rules do allow cellular operators such as GTE to take noncontrolling interests in designated entities and gain opportunities in the entrepreneurs' block. We have recently revised the cellular-PCS crossownership rules to facilitate such opportunities. 11           11         See Third Memorandum Opinion and Order     in Gen.

In the     Fifth Report and Order    , the Commission established eligibility rules for the entrepreneurs' blocks based, in part, on an applicant's gross revenues. To bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, the applicant, its attributable investors (    i.e.    , members of its control group and investors holding 25 percent or more of the applicant's total equity), and their respective affiliates must cumulatively have gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years and total assets of less than $500 million at the time the applicant files its Form 175 (``short form'' application). We pointed out in the     Fifth Report and Order     that the $125 million gross revenues limit corresponds roughly to the Commission's definition of a ``Tier 2,'' or medium-sized local exchange carrier (LEC) and would include virtually all of the independently-owned rural telephone companies. Additionally, to qualify for the special provisions accorded small businesses, the applicant (including attributable investors and affiliates), must cumulatively have less than $40 million in gross revenues averaged over the last three years.    18. MasTec, Inc. (MasTec) argues that the Commission's gross revenues test is misleading when applied across the board to all applicants because the gross revenues of investors operating in different industries will not convey the same information about size or the ability to attract capital. The Telephone Electronics Corporation (TEC) notes that the discontinuity between gross revenues and the ability to attract capital is particularly acute where the entity in question is involved in a volume-intensive business with high operating costs and small profit margins (such as TEC's interexchange resale carriers). Accordingly, TEC argues that the Commission's gross revenue criteria are not rationally related to their stated purpose and should be eliminated.    19. Several petitioners request that the Commission modify its gross revenues test, but disagree whether the limits should be liberalized or made more restrictive. For example, MasTec encourages the Commission to modify its designated entity criteria to include those minority businesses which are too small to compete outside of the entrepreneur blocks, but too large to qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks. The National Paging and Personal Communications Association (NPPCA) and USIMTA/USIPCA urge the Commission to reduce the gross revenues cap. Specifically, NPPCA requests that the Commission reduce the gross revenues limit to $75 million and the total assets limit to $250 million. NPPCA maintains that these modifications are needed because the present size standards encourage mid-sized companies to refrain from bidding in competitively unrestricted auctions and to compete, instead, against designated entities in the entrepreneurs' block auctions.    20. As an alternative to increasing the revenues cap, Omnipoint Communications, Inc. (Omnipoint) and the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, Inc. (NABOB) argue that the ``aggregation rule,'' under which the Commission will aggregate the gross revenues and total assets of the applicant, attributable investors and all affiliates in order to determine whether the applicant complies with the financial caps, should be eliminated. Omnipoint contends that a ``multiplier approach,'' employed in other areas of Commission practice, should be used to determine compliance with the financial caps. Under this approach, the revenues and assets attributed to an applicant would be based on the revenues and assets of each attributable investor, multiplied by the percentage ownership interest in the applicant held by that investor.    21. Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) requests that the Commission prescribe specific dates for measuring the financial thresholds to determine entrepreneurs' block eligibility. Specifically, CTIA requests clarification that gross revenues will be measured from the two years preceding September 23, 1993. 12  CTIA maintains that our current rules, referring only to the ``last two calendar years,'' are ambiguous.     See     47 CFR 24.709(a)(1).          12     September 23, 1993 is the date the Commission adopted its broadband PCS service rules order.     See Second Report and Order     in Gen. Docket No. 90314, 8 FCC Rcd 7700 (1993).         22. Black Entertainment Television Holdings, Inc. (BET), Roland A. Hernandez (Hernandez), Columbia PCS, Inc. (Columbia PCS), and Omnipoint all request that we clarify our rules governing growth by entrepreneurs' block licensees and their attributable investors during the five-year holding period. Our rule, promulgated in the     Fifth Report and Order    , states that ``[a]ny licensee *** shall maintain its eligibility [for the entrepreneurs' blocks] until at least five years from the date of initial license grant, except that increased gross revenues, increased total assets or personal net worth due to non-attributable equity investments ***, debt financing, revenue from operations, business development or expanded service shall not be considered.''     See     47 CFR 24.709(a)(3). Petitioners ask us to clarify whether the following types of growth in assets, revenues, or personal net worth would result in a licensee's forfeiture of eligibility: (1) Growth of applicant beyond the size limits by means of mergers or takeovers; (2) any control group member's growth beyond the size limits by means of appreciation of attributable investments or growth of attributable businesses; and (3) affiliates' or attributable investors' growth beyond the size limits, by means of mergers or takeovers.    23. We will retain a single gross revenues size standard, which is an established method for determining size eligibility for various kinds of federal programs that aid smaller businesses. 13  We anticipate that applicants will, in many instances, have several investors and that these investors will be drawn from various segments of the economy rather than from a single industry group such as telecommunications. The financial characteristics of these industry groups will vary widely, 14  and keying the size standard to each investor entity in question is thus administratively unworkable. A gross revenues test is a clear measure for determining the size of a business, and will produce the most equitable result for entrepreneurs' block applicants as a whole.          13     All federal agencies base eligibility of small businesses (or minority small businesses) to bid on a government contract set aside on the (single) size standard set forth in the solicitation.     See, e.g.    , 13 CFR 121.902. Eligibility for financial assistance from Small Business Investment Companies sponsored by the Small Business Administration is determined by a single size standard applicable across the board to all applicants or by the size standard applicable to the applicant's primary business activity.     See     13 CFR 121.802. Size status for receiving surety guarantees or assistance under SBA's Small Business Innovation Research Program is also determined by a single, applicant-wide size standard.     See     13 CFR 121.802(a)(3) and 121.1202, respectively.           14     The     Standard Industrial Classification Manual    , upon which the Small Business Administration bases its industry size standards, identifies over 800 industry groups to which specific Standard Industrial Classification Codes are assigned.

Specifically, CTIA requests clarification that gross revenues will be measured from the two years preceding September 23, 1993. 12  CTIA maintains that our current rules, referring only to the ``last two calendar years,'' are ambiguous.     See     47 CFR 24.709(a)(1).          12     September 23, 1993 is the date the Commission adopted its broadband PCS service rules order.     See Second Report and Order     in Gen. Docket No. 90314, 8 FCC Rcd 7700 (1993).         22. Black Entertainment Television Holdings, Inc. (BET), Roland A. Hernandez (Hernandez), Columbia PCS, Inc. (Columbia PCS), and Omnipoint all request that we clarify our rules governing growth by entrepreneurs' block licensees and their attributable investors during the five-year holding period. Our rule, promulgated in the     Fifth Report and Order    , states that ``[a]ny licensee *** shall maintain its eligibility [for the entrepreneurs' blocks] until at least five years from the date of initial license grant, except that increased gross revenues, increased total assets or personal net worth due to non-attributable equity investments ***, debt financing, revenue from operations, business development or expanded service shall not be considered.''     See     47 CFR 24.709(a)(3). Petitioners ask us to clarify whether the following types of growth in assets, revenues, or personal net worth would result in a licensee's forfeiture of eligibility: (1) Growth of applicant beyond the size limits by means of mergers or takeovers; (2) any control group member's growth beyond the size limits by means of appreciation of attributable investments or growth of attributable businesses; and (3) affiliates' or attributable investors' growth beyond the size limits, by means of mergers or takeovers.    23. We will retain a single gross revenues size standard, which is an established method for determining size eligibility for various kinds of federal programs that aid smaller businesses. 13  We anticipate that applicants will, in many instances, have several investors and that these investors will be drawn from various segments of the economy rather than from a single industry group such as telecommunications. The financial characteristics of these industry groups will vary widely, 14  and keying the size standard to each investor entity in question is thus administratively unworkable. A gross revenues test is a clear measure for determining the size of a business, and will produce the most equitable result for entrepreneurs' block applicants as a whole.          13     All federal agencies base eligibility of small businesses (or minority small businesses) to bid on a government contract set aside on the (single) size standard set forth in the solicitation.     See, e.g.    , 13 CFR 121.902. Eligibility for financial assistance from Small Business Investment Companies sponsored by the Small Business Administration is determined by a single size standard applicable across the board to all applicants or by the size standard applicable to the applicant's primary business activity.     See     13 CFR 121.802. Size status for receiving surety guarantees or assistance under SBA's Small Business Innovation Research Program is also determined by a single, applicant-wide size standard.     See     13 CFR 121.802(a)(3) and 121.1202, respectively.           14     The     Standard Industrial Classification Manual    , upon which the Small Business Administration bases its industry size standards, identifies over 800 industry groups to which specific Standard Industrial Classification Codes are assigned.

Nova estimated the total value of the transactions, including the eventual public offer of part of Fletcher Challenge's Methanex holding, as CDollars 1.14bn (USDollars 861m). It will finish with effective control of Methanex, whose total annual capacity is 4.2m tonnes. Methanex will be the world's largest producer, with 14 per cent of total capacity. Nova is acquiring its stake from Germany's Metallgesellschaft and from New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge resource and construction group. In the deal, Nova will put its own methanol assets into Methanex for Methanex stock, and subscribe for new Methanex shares. It will buy 6.4m Methanex shares from Metalgesellschaft and 15.5m shares from Fletcher Challenge. The balance of Fletcher's holding will be sold later via a public offer. Nova, which has been restructured into a pipeline and petrochemicals group, last month sold its gas production unit in western Canada to Seagull Energy of the US for CDollars 275m. 'The Methanex deal gives Nova the opportunity to participate in one of the world's leading suppliers of methanol,' said Mr Terry Poole, Nova's senior vice-president. Nova already has a strong methanol marketing presence in North America and Asia. Methanol, derived from natural gas, is used widely as a clean-burning fuel and in making additives for petrol.

The move will take Hochtief's holding in the larger Holzmann to 30 per cent, a platform from which Hochtief, itself a subsidiary of the RWE energy conglomerate, is likely to agitate for management control. Despite Holzmann's desire to remain independent, the case for merger is strong. The companies operate in compatible areas, with an especially good fit outside Germany where Holzmann's DM4bn of turnover makes it twice as big as its rival. The smaller Hochtief is the more profitable with a return of nearly 5 per cent on turnover at the last earnings peak, five times as high as at Holzmann. Hochtief could extract operational efficiencies at Holzmann, whose shares have underperformed the market by 50 per cent over the past five years. However compelling the argument for fusion, changes of corporate control in Germany - especially those promoted against the will of incumbent management  -are long-drawn out affairs in which the interests of the big shareholding banks invariably take precedence over those of minority shareholders. The traditional, back-door way for Hochtief to win control would be to acquire Deutsche Bank's 30 per cent stake in Holzmann (though at present the bank says it is not selling). Better, for the evolution of Germany's financial markets, would be for Hochtief to make a full-scale takeover offer.   Companies:-  Hochtief.     Philip Holzmann.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.

To  this end, Ps. putida, Ps. alcaligenes, B. subtilis  strains from the collection of the Voodoobrabotka Research  center are used. The microorganisms were grown a salt medium.  The study demonstrates that the strains capable of utilizing  surface active substances contain plasmid DNA yet with respect  to urea, this property does not correlate with the presence of  plasmids. It is speculated that it is coded by chromosomal  genes. The findings open the possibility of developing vector  molecules for B. subtilis on the basis of the pMA9  and pMA10 plasmid genomes. A comparison to published data makes  it possible to note that plasmids DNA participating in the  biodegradation of ampholytic surfactants are detected in a  number of Ps. putida strains. The importance of  separating the direct genes which determine biodegradation of  syntanol is stressed. Figures 1; references 3: 2 Russian, 1  Western.      "

Chernobyl is the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986, which was responsible for 8,000 deaths and radioactive contamination in Ukraine, Russia and Belorussia. The decision to keep Chernobyl open is part of Ukraine's policy to develop domestic energy production and reduce reliance on its main energy supplier, Russia, with whom Ukraine has had difficult relations since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Cash-strapped Ukraine is plagued with energy shortages and has a Dollars 2.5bn oil and gas debt to Russia. Atomic energy currently accounts for 35 per cent of the nation's electricity consumption. Although public opinion is strongly against nuclear power, Ukraine's energy crisis has swayed the parliament into overturning the popular 1991 order to close Chernobyl. However, many western and Ukrainian scientists have questioned the long-term safety of the Soviet-designed RBMK reactors, which are not used in the west. More than 115 nuclear safety violations have occurred at Ukraine's five power stations since the beginning of this year. Only two of Chernobyl's four reactors are in operation. A third reactor was shut down two years ago after a fire. The fourth reactor, where the Chernobyl explosion took place, is encased in a cracking concrete shell. A replacement shell is to be constructed.   Countries:-  UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.   Industries:-  P2819 Industrial Inorganic Chemicals, NEC.     P4911 Electric Services.

Engineer Mohammad Reza Ne'matzadeh, minister of industries,  gave a press conference in which he announced the above. He  said: Of this amount, Rls482 billion is for the difference  between subsidies and banking facilities, Rls820 billion is for  semicomplete projects, and Rls110 billion is for development and  application research and study.    He added: In this ministry's organizational plan, in the  event investments are made, Rls20,000 billion are provided by  the government and the private sector, and the growth of  industry's added value is to be 6.2 percent. If the budget is  not procured and there is no government support, we will not  achieve this goal in the Second Five-Year Plan.    The minister of industries cited as the industrial sector's  main goals in the Second Five-Year Economic and Social  Development Plan the giving of roots to industrial production,  increasing the profitability of production and raising its  usability, making the desired use of existing industrial  capacities, increasing the competitiveness of the nation's  industrial production on international markets, increasing  industrial employment, raising society's standard of living and  protecting the environment.    Engineer Ne'matzadeh then discussed the importance of the  technical studies and development and application research  sectors. He said: To achieve this goal Rls150 billion will have  to be invested, and the Plan and Budget Organization has  confirmed Rls110 billion of this amount.    Continuing, the minister of industries discussed the fact  that in the First Five-Year Economic Development Plan 180  research and development units were created in production units.  He emphasized the necessity to increase these units in the  Second Five-Year Plan. He said: It is expected that this number  will triple under the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: Since the  position of research in this country is quite low, it is  necessary that the government give attention to this sector.    This sector needs to have Rls600 billion credit allocated to  it from the development budget. If these credits are obtained we  will see 2 percent added value in this sector.    Engineer Ne'matzadeh cited aid in the creation of industrial  infrastructure as another of this ministry's aims. He said: To  create industrial villages, in view of the increase in the price  of foreign exchange, credit of Rls350 billion is needed.    He then discussed the proposed notes that pertain to the  deprived areas. He added: The portion of profits from companies  and economic activities that is used to invest in the priority  areas will be tax exempt.    He also added: In the annual budgets the government is  required to allocate the credits needed to procure  infrastructure resources including water, electrical power, gas,  access roads and industrial villages, in such a way that at  least 70 percent of the costs for preparing industrial villages  or industrial and mining projects located in the nation's  deprived areas and 50 percent of the costs of preparing other  industrial villages in the municipalities which are not province  centers will be paid out of the development budgets.    The minister of industries continued: To implement policies  that encourage and reinforce development and spread industries  and mines in the deprived areas, the government is required to  pay 50 percent of the annual costs of consumer electricity, as  well as the foreman's and worker shares and social insurance  premiums in the industrial and mining units located in the  nation's deprived and underprivileged areas. This money will  come from part of the revenues obtained through customs levies  and commercial profits taxes on imported goods.    Engineer Ne'matzadeh complained about the Plan and Budget  Organization's cut in the proposed budget for the Industrial  Planning Council. He said: Because industry and employment must  be created in the country and the share of the nation's  appropriate export must be increased, these changes will create  problems to some extent for the industrial sector.    He then discussed progress of hardware in the nation's  industries in the First Five-Year Plan. He said: In the Second  Five-Year Plan attention has also been given to the development  of software.    The minister of industries said: In view of the fact that  the  electronics industry is undergoing striking growth in the  country while in Iran electronics makes up only 0.2 percent of  GNP [gross national product], to support development research  and innovation and to advance this industry, an Electronics  Industries Development Support Fund will be created.    In the area of exports he also discussed matters such as the  establishment of insurance for exports, the provision of credit  facilities for exporters, the creation of a permanent exhibition  for industrial export goods, activation of the committee to  develop nonoil exports, activation of commercial representation  by opening exports in foreign countries, and other things.    In conclusion he asked researchers, writers, and translators  to contact this ministry and make use of its available  facilities if they have foreign books and articles and are  having problems getting them printed and published.

Industrial sabotage and other incidents of passive resistance are said  to be on the upswing.    What China's leaders fear most is the conjoining of student and worker unrest.  It was just such a fusion that made possible last spring's pro-democracy  movement, prompting authorities to invoke martial law in Beijing. A similar  fusion presaged autumn's tidal wave of popular protest in Eastern Europe,  culminating in the collapse of Communist regimes throughout the region.    Few observers are predicting an imminent recurrence of large-scale political  disturbances in China. Yet the mood in Beijing remains strained, with strong  undercurrents of indignation.    Beijing's attempt to sweep the carnage of June 3-4 under the rug was rendered  ineffective by the presence of too many eyewitnesses, too many video cameras  and fax machines, too many radios tuned to BBC and the Voice of America. It is  striking that the citizens of Romania also relied heavily upon BBC, VOA and  Radio Free Europe to keep abreast of local and international developments  throughout their December upheavals.

The ministry admitted a tendency of dangerous waste imports  but said it prepares measures to prevent the threat.    According to the Greenpeace report, there have been 96  attempts to bring to Russia 34 million tones of waste within six  years. Specialists believe these were mere intentions.    In the words of the ministry, the Russian procedure of  industrial waste imports and exports ``prevents imports of large  batches of dangerous waste to Russia.'' The Russian Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations issues licenses and the Russian state  customs committee controls the waste imports. A license is  issued on coordination with the environment ministry; the latter  provide for a corresponding examination.    The procedure is obligatory for all, and its violation  entails administrative and criminal responsibility.    According to the ministry, territorial environmental bodies  have rejected the overwhelming majority of proposals of Western  firms and their Russian mediators on the basis of expert  conclusions. In 1992-1993 they coordinated licenses on imports  of small batches of industrial waste, as a rule, for research  purposes.    In order to prevent illegal attempts of dangerous waste  imports, the ministry works in close contact with the  law-enforcement and environment bodies of several states.     "

Also, relaxation of the investment system and trade  with developing countries is proposed.    As one link in restructuring small and medium-sized  businesses in Japan, there will be support of capital to enable  gradual progress in overseas investments. In addition to the  Restructuring Support Loan System for direct overseas investment  from government finance organs, advisory guidance for companies  venturing overseas will also be implemented.

Welfare rights workers who launched a drive to alert sufferers to their potential eligibility to compensation said new medical evidence on the condition meant that cases previously rejected by the Department of Social Security would be re-examined. The campaigners, who have already helped win about Pounds 500,000 compensation from the DSS for people in the Wearside area, estimated that the eventual total in their area alone could run into many millions of pounds, with up to 10,000 cases being re-examined. Awards so far include lump-sum payments ranging from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 20,000. Successful claims may also result in weekly disablement pension payments and reduced earnings allowances. The Benefits Agency said it understood more medical evidence about the disease had become available. Previously unsuccessful claims could be reviewed on production of new evidence, but this did not necessarily mean decisions would be reversed. The campaign was launched by the Trades Union Congress Unemployed Centre in Sunderland two years ago, in conjunction with Sunderland City Council's social services department. Industrial hygiene specialists from Newcastle upon Tyne University and ear, nose and throat surgeons from Sunderland Royal Infirmary and Newcastle's Freeman Hospital have been involved in collecting data on the disease.

The cold reduction mill will have a capacity of about 2m tonnes of sheet metal a year, and will come into production at the beginning of 1997, according to an announcement from SMS company head-quarters in Dusseldorf yesterday. The 10-member consortium includes Siemens, the engineering conglomerate, Hochtief, the Essen construction company, and MAN Gutehoffnungshutte, as well as Magnitostroy, the construction company in Magnitogorsk. The contract is worth DM300m to SMS, which has just announced a 54 per cent drop in profits for 1992/93, to DM39m on a turnover of DM1.968bn, because of the worldwide slowdown in investment plans, especially in the steel industry. The company is involved in three other big projects in Russia, including another cold reduction mill (with Siemens) at Novo-Lipetsk, the modernisation of a hot rolling mill at Novo-Lipetsk, and the modernisation of an aluminium plant at Samara. A spokesman said yesterday that the contract was on a cash basis, and would be financed by revenues from steel exports of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Kombinat (MMK). It does not have any export credit guarantees from Hermes, the German export credit agency. With production capacity of 16m tonnes and a workforce of 65,000 people, MMK is one of Russia's biggest steel makers.   Companies:-  SMS Schloemann-Siemag.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.

Laclede, based in the US, has nearly 1m tonnes of modern steelmaking capacity and several product plants. It has weathered the recession in good shape, with book value at around USDollars 100m. However, Ivaco, carrying a high debt load from rapid expansion in the early 1980s, has been hit by the long recession and a high Canadian dollar from 1988 to early 1992. It has appointed Paine Webber, the New York investment bankers, to find a buyer. Lower interest charges and other non-operating factors helped Imperial Oil, Canada's biggest oil company and a subsidiary of Exxon of the US, lift net earnings by 20 per cent last year, writes Bernard Simon. However, lower crude oil volumes, pipeline limitations and narrower margins on refined products continued to depress the company's operating performance. Net earnings rose to CDollars 195m (USDollars 152.3m), or CDollars 1.01 a share, from CDollars 162m, or 84 cents, in 1991. Fourth-quarter earnings were CDollars 51m, compared with a CDollars 124m loss. Annual revenues fell to CDollars 9.13bn from CDollars 9.5bn.   Companies:-  Laclede Steel.     Ivaco.

A senior Foreign  Ministry official said that ""it probably is a bargaining chip to  win concessions from Japan."" While hard-liners say that Japan  can beat the provision by filing complaints with GATT, the  government is perplexed with the U.S.-led development of the  trade friction issue. Unrest is prevailing in industrial  circles, and Japanese-U.S. relations may become even worse after  this.    Government Reactions    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  believes that ""even if the United States opens an investigation  according to the act, this is unlikely to result in unilateral  sanctions."" Under the Super 301 provision, the United States  may raise tariffs on Japanese products or limit imports using a  quantitative quota. However, the MITI believes that if these  actions are taken without following GATT procedures, this would  be regarded as a violation of GATT regulations, as well as those  of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will replace GATT  in 1996.    Referring to the fact that the reinstated Super 301  provision  provides 180 days for negotiations before sanctions are imposed,  the MITI official said: ""Under the new provision, the  negotiation period is extended by six times. The United States  has adopted a strategy of using economic sanctions as a  bargaining chip.""    The MITI is taking a tough stand toward this issue, saying:  ""When the United States takes unilateral action, that nation is  most likely to impose higher tariffs on Japanese-made products.  In that case, Japan can beat the sanctions by filing a  complaint with GATT.""    The U.S. Government, however, is unlikely to actually  trigger  a trade war with Japan. A senior Foreign Ministry official  said: ""Even if GATT supports the U.S. sanctions, that would not  reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit. Such actions cannot be a  sovereign remedy for the bilateral trade frictions."" He then  demonstrated the ministry's passive attitude toward the issue,  saying: ""The Super 301 sanctions and Japan's complaints to GATT  would just produce unnecessary conflict between Japan and the  United States. I just hope that the United States will not pull  the trigger.""    Because U.S. negotiators say that ""the ball is in Japan's  court"" (as noted by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor),  Japan's voluntary market-opening package is becoming the focal  point of the issue. While Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has  ordered that the package be formulated within this month, a  senior MITI official demonstrated a pessimistic view of its  effectiveness, saying: ""We have already offered almost  everything we have. The package would not look very fresh.""    Some hard-liners in the government say: ""It is unnecessary  to prepare such a market-opening package. If Japan does so,  this will acknowledge the U.S. claim that the Japanese market is  exclusionary."" They, however, have no alternative plans for  rehabilitating Japanese-U.S. relations.    Industrial Circles    Industrial circles are wary of the revival of the Super 301  provision. Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile  Manufacturers Association [JAMA], stated that ""we are deeply  concerned about the revival of this sanction-oriented  provision."" But, the JAMA intends to carefully watch  developments in this issue for the time being, pointing out that  ""the type of sanctions and other details are still unknown.""    Auto industry circles have long been dealing with U.S.  demands for expanded imports of auto parts. The Toyota Motor  Corp. has prepared a plan for the voluntary expansion of  purchases of U.S.-made auto parts. Therefore, major automakers  are beginning to question the trade policy of the U.S.  Government, noting: ""Unilateral sanctions go against GATT  principles. The U.S. trade deficit with Japan is a  macroeconomic issue, not a microeconomic issue (related to such  individual trade sectors as automobiles).""    Because it is questionable if the United States really wants  to impose sanctions on Japan, some quarters demonstrated calm  attitudes. A management official of a major automaker said:  ""If the United States limits auto imports from Japan, that  would harm U.S. consumers. It is questionable whether they  really intend to do so."" The Electronic Industries Association  of Japan [EIAJ] is also exhibiting a prudent attitude toward the  U.S. decision. EIAJ Managing Director Iwao Oshima said:  ""Sanctions under the Super 301 provision may be regarded as  violations of GATT regulations. We want to watch future  developments.""    On the other hand, a trading house official said, ""Super 301  will be an effective weapon because it can apply strong  pressures on trade barriers even without actual sanctions."" NEC  Corp. President Tadahiro Sekimoto said, ""Japan should reduce its  trade surplus through such macroeconomic policies as domestic  market expansion and trade surplus recycling.""    Moreover, Takeshi Kondo, director of the Politics-Economics  Research Institute under the Itochu Corp., noted: ""The trade  friction is caused by Japan's failure to deal appropriately with  the issue. While the Japanese Government promised increased  public investment and tax cuts, it gave no estimate of how these  policies can contribute to reducing the trade surplus.""     "

The Rovelli clan is one such. Nino Rovelli, it may be recalled, was the aggressive tycoon whose petrochemicals empire collapsed in 1979. But this week his five direct heirs have received a handsome cheque for L678bn. The cheque represents the final settlement of a 15-year legal battle involving 12 separate hearings waged by the Rovellis against financial institutions. They were accused of failing to take proper account of the Rovellis' petrochemicals flagship, Sir, when some L4,000bn of debt was called in. The battle with IMI, the treasury-controlled financial services group now about to be privatised, was particularly bitter. Just before Nino Rovelli died two years ago he was reportedly willing to settle for L250bn; IMI then thought it might get better terms. The settlement now agreed is the largest ever such pay-out - even more so once a L330bn tax deduction is added on. IMI has long set aside covering funds; nevertheless, the Rovelli cheque looks pretty large beside the L2,200bn shortly to be raised from offering 30 per cent of its stock. The cheque goes to Rovelli's widow, Primarosa, and their four children. Now based in Switzerland, the family has yet to say how it will spend the lucre.   Companies:-  Instituto Mobiliare Italiano.

The Mach-5 engine is being developed as a joint effort by  aerospace engine makers from Japan, the U.S., Britain and  France. The design calls for an engine which combines a  turbojet, like those used on conventional subsonic aircraft,  with a ramjet, like those used on missiles. The turbojet would  accelerate the aircraft up to Mach-3, after which the ramjet  would kick in.    A one-third scale model of the turbojet part of the engine  has been constructed which is capable of withstanding  temperatures of 1,600 C--a temperature at which conventional  engines melt. To achieve this high heat resistance, the engine  blades were made from a special nickel alloy and a more  effective air-cooling system was designed.    This model was then loaded with fuel and fired up for the  first time to verify the engine's power characteristics and its  ability to withstand shaking. The tests were carried out on 15  November at a plant operated by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy  Industries Co.    The small-scale model engine did not reach an internal  temperature of 1,600 C during the tests, but the international  research group does not plan to test the heat-resistant  characteristics of the engine until fiscal 1995. The goal is to  develop a practical Mach-5 engine by the year 2020.     "

The index ended 182.94 higher at 19,751.55. Investors were initially discouraged by Tuesday's sharp decline on Wall Street and the market saw a low of 19,487.70 briefly after the opening. However, a rise in futures prompted active arbitrage buying, while a rebound in Japan Telecom provided further support, and the Nikkei rose to a high of 19,752.55 just before the close. Volume remained below 200m shares for the third consecutive session, at 197m against 161m. Traders now expect most investors to remain absent ahead of the October 27 listing of Japan Tobacco. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 9.26 at 1,582.05, while the Nikkei 300 put on 2.39 at 289.89. In spite of the rise in the indices, losers led gainers by 491 to 478, with 212 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 0.72 at 1,300.27. Japan Telecom was ahead Y340,000 at Y4.14m after hitting a record low of Y3.73m in the morning. Some dealers had feared initially that investors looking to purchase Japan Tobacco stock would sell high-priced former state-owned companies' shares to raise funds. But NTT recovered Y15,000 to Y877,000 after a three-day fall, and East Japan Railway improved Y8,000 to Y483,000. Nippon Shinpan, a consumer credit company sold on Tuesday on fears of financial problems at its subsidiaries, rebounded Y27 to Y785. The company denied rumours that its finance affiliates were suffering from mounting bad loans. Paper and pulp issues were stronger on hopes of improving demand. Honshu Paper rose Y32 to Y650 and New Oji Paper added Y20 at Y1,020. High-technology stocks were mixed. Sony declined Y30 to Y5,770, but NEC rose Y30 to Y1,220 and Matsushita Electric Industrial firmed Y10 to Y1,580. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 6.30 at 21,969.28 in volume of 9.6m shares. Buying by public funds supported the index. Roundup There was a conventional response in the region to Wall Street's overnight losses, but several markets moved higher.

The Gas Consumers Council, which represents the UK's 17m gas users, says in its annual report today that it believes proposals by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for restructuring British Gas and creating more competition in gas supply might mean higher prices. The reforms were agreed after a long row between British Gas and the OFT. They compel British Gas to cut its share of the industrial gas market by 50 per cent within three years and allow other gas suppliers to use its pipelines. The consumers council report warns that there is a limited amount of gas in the UK market and more competition might force the price of this gas higher. Sir James McKinnon, the director-general of Ofgas, the industry's watchdog, said both domestic and industrial consumers would benefit from competition. Industrial consumers that were buying from suppliers other than British Gas were very satisfied and had seen price cuts of between 7 per cent and 9 per cent.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

The analyst says:    Japan has never let a chance pass by without saying the  production and stockpile of a large quantity of plutonium in the  country were for ""a peaceful purpose"" and it would not lead to  the conversion of Japan into a nuclear power. It has also  boastfully claimed that it is ""a model"" in accepting inspections  by the International Atomic Energy Agency. But it was fully  revealed this time that all this was a lie.    The analyst continues:    Pretending to open to the public the amount of stockpiled  plutonium, Japan has concealed a part of it. This proves that  it has invariably stepped up the design to turn itself into a  nuclear power under the cloak of ""a peaceful purpose.""    Broad public circles of the world have considered that  Japan's stockpile of plutonium more than necessary is related to  its design to become a nuclear power.    The Japanese authorities are now clamouring about  ""investigation"" and ""removal of misgivings."" This is, however, a  belated excuse.    Japan's nuclear design remains unchanged. It is racing  headlong toward nuclear armament.    Its nuclear armament poses a serious threat to the peace and  security in Asia and the rest of the world.     "

A big, off-putting word, deflation. Essentially, it means that in the 1990s the  price of the farm will be less important than the size and price of the corn  crop.    To review and explain. Financial experts these days are like seismologists  watching for an earthquake. Stock and bond traders -- and government officials  -- seem to be waiting for problems in real estate to cause a spectacular bank  failure, the collapse of an insurance firm, a chain reaction of financial  disaster.    Even their optimistic moments are ominous. When Security Pacific Bank last week  set aside reserves against loan losses in Britain and Australia, the markets  heaved a sigh of relief that California real estate was not specifically  mentioned.    That's grasping at straws. California office buildings are unlikely to be  spared in the bust that is following the worldwide property boom of the 1980s.    The United States has a 10-year surplus of office buildings, London's  oversupply is even greater and Paris and Tokyo are still madly adding office  space to saturated markets, says David Shulman, managing director and head of  real estate research at Salomon Bros. investment firm.    The boom was driven by inflationary expectations that a property built or  purchased today would always be worth more tomorrow.    Now the boom is over, and the fear is that buildings will decline in value,  throwing loans into default, causing banks and other businesses to fail and the  whole economy to spiral downward into a rerun of the 1930s Depression -- the  last great era of asset deflation.    But that is going too far, says Shulman. Sure, the new decade will be long and  hard in real estate, with office buildings declining as much as 30% in value.  But real estate can hurt without inflicting pain on the whole economy. ""Office  buildings are only 0.6% of the gross national product,"" he says. ""It's a very  large economy.""    And the real story today is how some very big and smart money is preparing to  invest in that large economy.    Warbug Pincus, a New York-based investment firm, has just raised $2 billion  from its backers -- including the General Electric, General Motors and Pacific  Telesis pension funds.    The 51-year-old firm is known for rescuing Mattel in 1983 with a $40-million  equity investment, and making a $150-million investment in Pittsburgh's  troubled Mellon Bank. Chairman Lionel Pincus is not frightened by today's  changing economy. ""We've lived through cycles before,"" he says, ""and the  pattern is familiar: shock, paralysis, despair, panic and then resolution.    ""We are now between paralysis -- the credit crunch -- and despair,"" he says. So  opportunities are emerging for his fund and others to recapitalize companies  with equity investment.    Theodore C. Rogers, who heads American Industrial Partners, a $200-million  investment fund with backing from the Bank of America and Wells Fargo pension  funds, among others, is looking to invest in manufacturing and industrial  distribution companies.    The fund brings operating expertise as well as cash to investments; Rogers is a  former chairman of NL Industries and a longtime manufacturing executive.    The new equity funds are the opposite of the 1980s' leveraged buyouts, which  relied on the company's income or the sale of its assets to pay debt, leaving  LBO backers with a valuable property they could sell. The assumptions  underlying LBOs were that income would not fall, you could always sell assets  and resale values would go up or at least not go down.    None of those assumptions are valid in the changed economy.    Instead, there is a new way to create value -- increase the company's profits  -- as American Industrial Partners' first deal illustrates perfectly.    Rogers expects shortly to invest almost $12 million in two box-making companies  in Northern California -- names undisclosed because the deal is not signed yet.    The $12 million, which will represent 42% of the two firms' combined equity  capital, will go for high-speed packaging and production lines and an ink plant  to serve both companies. With the new machinery, American Partners hopes to  increase profits from $1.3 million to $3 million within 18 months, and to earn  their returns as the businesses grow from there.    They don't plan to sell for five to seven years and, in fact, assume that the  box companies' resale value at any time may be lower than it is today. But  income will go up if the investments are made and the business is well managed.    And that will be the pattern for business in the new decade, says Rogers.  ""You'll have to work the crop, not sell the farm.""    Which is enormously encouraging. The new decade will have a productive bias,  not an inflationary one.

The Union of Industrial and Employers Confederations of  Europe (UNICE) said the way to economic recovery lay through  lowering the burden due to the state, improving labour  flexibility and boosting small business.    ""There can no longer be any question of imposing more  charges  on businessmen. They are sinking. They are no longer  competitive,"" UNICE president Francois Perigot said.    He presented a UNICE report entitled ""Making Europe More  Competitive"" which said that businessmen needed to wean  themselves away from state aid and that EU governments should  not depend on business to fund swollen welfare programmes.    The report called for deregulation and privatisation of such  government sectors as posts and telecommunications, energy and  transport, plus a more efficient public sector and more open  public procurement tenders.    It urged stricter conditions for unemployment, health and  other welfare handouts, along with a lower minimum wage, fewer  restrictions on dismissing workers, and pay rises pegged to  productivity.    Perigot rejected suggestions that governments should fund  welfare programmes from an energy tax.    ""For 30 years we have been continually expanding the sources  of (government) revenue without ever attacking spending,"" he  told a press conference.    UNICE's call came four days ahead of an EU leadership summit  on Friday and Saturday which will look for ways to cut  unemployment and boost Europe's declinin competitiveness against  the United States and Asia.

0,FT942-10128 ,"FT942-10128 _AN-EELCZACKFT 940512   FT  12 MAY 94 / Recovery found to be spreading to all regions      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   Industrial recovery has spread to all regions, with manufacturing companies throughout the country reporting an increase in orders for the first time since early 1989. Yet the latest quarterly regional industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies, a regional consultancy, suggests that the improvement, although widespread, is not strong enough to offset all adverse local factors. A positive balance of companies in the 11 regions said orders rose in the four months to April, but returns pointed to a small decline in overall demand in northern England and Scotland in the four months to July. By contrast, the south-east and west Midlands, where companies experienced a severe recession, appeared to be in the forefront of recovery. This was a sign of the upturn becoming more firmly rooted, the survey says. Output increased in all regions except Northern Ireland in the four months to April: the first such rise in all mainland Britain for four years. Output is expected to rise everywhere except Scotland and the north during the four months to July. Mr Charles Burton, Business Strategies joint managing director, said Scotland and the north were hit by a reduction in North Sea oil investment. A boom in Scottish electronic production appeared to be ending, while industries in the north were hit by pit closures. The survey, carried out between March 25 and April 13, found that the east and west Midlands, the south-east and Wales had experienced 'appreciable' increases in demand during the past four months. The four regions, together with the north-west, East Anglia and Northern Ireland, expected continued strong order growth in the present four-month period. A positive balance of companies in all regions expected export order growth in the four months to July. Only Yorkshire and Humberside reported a net drop in export orders in the four months to April. The survey found companies in eight of the 11 regions planning to increase investment in plant and machinery in the next 12 months. Investment is still expected to fall slightly in the south-east, the biggest region, reflecting the depth of the recession. This set a low base for the recovery which so far has generated no powerful motive for investment. Manufacturing industry continued to shed jobs in most regions in the second quarter, although employment in-creased in Wales and the west Midlands compared with a year ago. The survey says that increases in demand and output are not leading to any marked increase in price pressures. CBI/BSL Regional Trends Survey, May 1994.

In addition to Taiwan investment, a number of Southeast  Asian  nations poured money into Vietnam last year, including Malaysia,  Thailand and Indonesia, who invested US$346 million, US$209  million and US$131 million respectively, the IDIC statistics  showed.    From 1988 to November, 1993, Taiwan's accumulated investment  in Vietnam hit US$1.275 billion with Taiwan Sugar Corp. and  Chinese Petroleum Corp. as leading investors.    Hong Kong ranked second in accumulated investment, with  US$1.064 billion during the period. South Korea came in third  with US$473 million, followed by Australia's US$415 million and  Japan's US$414 million.    In recent years, foreign capital has continuously poured  into  Vietnam due to its cheap labor and the legislation of an  investment law in 1987 as well as the free market reform policy  adopted by the Vietnamese Government at the end of the 1980s.    The market reform policy, although coming later than similar  policies in other Southeast Asian countries, still fueled an  outstanding average economic growth of 7.1 percent over the past  three years.    Total approved foreign investment in Vietnam in 1991 reached  US$1.146 billion, and the figure jumped to US$2.863 billion in  1993, the statistics showed.    Although Taiwan topped other investors in 1993, its US$430  million was a decline of 17.8 percent from 1992, the IDIC  statistics showed.    Taiwan manufacturers focused their investments in the hotel,  tourism, service, petroleum and natural gas industries.     "

0,FT942-984 ,"FT942-984 _AN-EF0DGABTFT 940627   FT  27 JUN 94 / Employers warned on attendance      By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff   Employers may be breaking the law if they force workers to take holiday or unpaid leave because of travel disruption caused by the rail dispute, the Industrial Society warned today. The society, an independent advisory and training body and an authority on employment practice, urged employers to be 'firm, but fair' about absenteeism caused by the strikes. It said it had heard of several cases where workers had been told that they should take a day's holiday or unpaid leave if they could not get to work because of the strikes. Ms Sonia Pearson, personnel expert at the society, said: 'Bosses who are forcing workers to take holiday, or even unpaid leave, on days when they genuinely cannot travel to the office could be breaking the law if this power is not included in their employment contracts. As well as creating ill-will they are not solving the immediate absence problem.' She added: 'But that does not mean they should tolerate absences from people who could make it to work with reasonable effort - and employees have a duty to make every effort to come to work, which includes finding alternative routes.' The society suggested ways that absence could be reduced, including contributing to extra expenses incurred by staff who made the journey into work, such as parking fees or taxi fares, so long as they had been agreed in advance.

Divers located the bodies of two maintenance workers killed Monday when an  early morning explosion rumbled through the underpinnings of Ford Motor Co.'s  Rouge complex.    The victims were identified as Billy Stiener, 27, of Redford and John L. Hatch,  in his early 50s, of Detroit, Ford spokesman John Spelich said.    The bodies were located at 7:30 p.m. Monday in a half-mile-long portion of a  utility tunnel that carries electric, water, steam and compressed air services  to several buildings at the 1,100-acre facility. The tunnel, seven to eight  feet in diameter, was flooded with four to six feet of water after the blast  apparently ruptured a water pipe, Spelich said.    ""For the moment, our No. 1 priority is to find out what caused the accident,""  said Alexander J. Trotman, who will become executive vice president for Ford's  North American operations on May 1.    The blast tore holes in parking lots, flipped cars, blew windows from a  three-story power substation and forced the company to shut down a number of  operations, including the Mustang automobile assembly line.    John Schultz, a driver for a bus company Ford contracts to carry people around  the huge complex, said he saw ""flames shooting 300 to 500 feet into the air for  a short period of time"" shortly after the 6:20 a.m. blast.    Spelich said the two victims were employed by Doetsch Industrial Services Inc.  of Detroit. A woman answering the Doetsch telephone, who refused to give her  name, said the company has done maintenance work at the Rouge complex for  years.

The company had announced a restructuring of its chemical operations as far back as December 1991, and a spin-off was widely expected. The announcement, however, came earlier than anticipated. Cyanamid has steadily distanced itself from its chemical operations over the past two years. It has already sold eight chemicals businesses and last year its remaining chemical operations were set up as a separate unit, with its own headquarters, under the Cytec Industries name. Cyanamid's chemicals business had 1992 operating earnings of Dollars 34m, up 6 per cent from 1991, while sales slid 8 per cent to Dollars 1.05bn. In contrast, the company's medical group saw sales rise 10 per cent in the year to Dollars 2.89bn although operating earnings rose a more moderate 3 per cent to Dollars 395m. The decision to move away from chemicals to concentrate on higher-margin drugs and life sciences operations was widely applauded in 1991, at a time when many pharmaceuticals companies saw earnings growth in the 20 per cent range. In recent months, however, Cyanamid's stock price has fallen, along with other pharmaceutical company issues, amid concern that the Clinton administration's criticism of high drug prices will translate into slower earnings growth. The spin-off, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed towards the end of the year. Terms were not disclosed.   Companies:-  American Cyanamid.

He stressed that we should  regard raising economic efficiency as our central task to  enhance progress. He said: To accelerate progress, we must  uphold the principle of seeking truth from facts and proceed to  perform all our tasks in a down-to-earth manner. We definitely  cannot blindly compete for rates of progress. After integrating  speed, efficiency, quality, and the market in accordance with  the actual conditions of various trades and localities, we  should strive to raise efficiency in an effort to accomplish  rapid progress within our reach.    China's Industrial Economy Society is a national mass  organization voluntarily formed by representatives from large  and medium state industrial enterprises and industrial  enterprises under other ownerships; scientific research and  designing units; industrial economic research groups; relevant  state departments; and renowned figures from industrial and  economic circles. In the five years since its establishment, it  has achieved enormous accomplishments in providing two-way  services for the government and grass-roots units. The purpose  of the national congress and the second national executive  meeting is to summarize past work and study concepts for future  tasks.    In his speech at the meeting, Bo Yibo stressed two issues:  1. The necessity of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and  control; and 2. correctly handling the relationship between  speed and efficiency.    Addressing the first issue, Bo Yibo said: Under the guidance  of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress in 1993, China reported rapid economic  progress, reform was carried out in an all-around manner, and  the overall economy progressed favorably. In an effort to  resolve acute contradictions and problems since the beginning of  last summer, the party Central Committee and State Council  promptly deepened reform and have taken mainly economic measures  to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control. We have  attained positive results. While fully affirming the results,  we should also soberly notice: We have yet to thoroughly  resolve many deep-seated problems in economic work, and many  macroeconomic regulatory and control measures are merely  temporary solutions that do not effect a permanent cure.  Our ultimate goal is to reform the economic structure thoroughly  and to establish a socialist market economic structure. What  merits our attention today is the continued pressure of  inflation and strains on the macroeconomy as a result of the  overextended or evergrowing investment scale of fixed assets and  high price hikes in the markets. Such a phenomenon is  unavoidable in the process of establishing a socialist market  economy in China. Experience shows that the pace of  marketization must be commensurate with the ability of  macroeconomic regulation and control. A greater ability in  macroeconomic regulation and control can reduce problems and  make their solution easier. At the present, macroeconomic  regulation and control should be focused on strictly controlling  the investment scale of fixed assets. We should leave some  margin in our construction scale, which must be compatible with  our national strength. We should not rely on excessive issuance  of money to ""keep up"" with the evergrowing construction scale.  We must implement to the letter and in all economic sectors and  all fields of work the series of macroeconomic regulatory and  control policy measures which have been meticulously drawn up by  the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the  core, for thoroughly reforming the economic structure. It is  absolutely not allowed to continue the practice of ""getting  around the central authorities' policies with countermeasures,""  and to ignore the order and do things one's own way. We must  consider the overall interests and safeguard the party central  committee's authority.    Discussing the question of how to correctly handle the  relationship between speed and efficiency, Bo Yibo pointed out:  Growth rate and economic efficiency must be organically combined  because development is the essential criterion. Since we have  stressed efficiency and quality, we must strive to develop the  export-oriented economy at a faster pace. This is Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's consistent thought. To accurately and  comprehensively understand this thought to ensure the organic  combination of growth rate and economic efficiency is crucial  for maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of  the national economy. In view of the already high national  economic growth rate and of the rising enthusiasm in all  sectors, it is necessary to emphasize the need to focus  attention on raising economic efficiency. Compared with the  developed countries, we do not see much change in our low  industrial economic efficiency as reflected in such problems as  seeking unduly high output value to the negligence of quality;  blindly turning out what one can produce without considering  market sales and demands; focusing attention only on expanding  production scale while failing to optimizing economic structure;  and competing with others for funds to launch construction  projects without giving a thought to our national strength and  financial and material resources. These problems, which  actually reflect the maladies of the production-oriented economy  and traditional planned economic structure over the years, have  almost become chronic and stubborn diseases in some enterprises  and localities, and have brought about serious consequences for  the progress of our undertakings. With the development of a  socialist market economy, we should say now is the time to wake  up to reality. We must correctly and unmistakably understand  the central committee's emphasis on seizing the opportunity and  accelerating development, and should not one-sidedly understand  it as a go-ahead signal to ignore the law on economic  development and to seek an unduly high growth rate. The central  committee's 8-9 percent targeted growth rate for the Eighth  Five-Year Plan is both positive and prudent. We must see to it  that the focus of economic work is truly shifted to the orbit  centering on improved economic efficiency. If we develop the  economy in this manner, even a 10 percent growth rate will still  be solid and sound. An overextended scale of capital  construction beyond the limit of our national strength will  inevitably lead to readjustment of the growth rate, and will  ultimately deprive us of the opportunity of development and  delay the progress of our socialist modernization drive.    Bo Yibo pointed out: To ensure the organic combination of  speed and efficiency, it is imperative to implement the state's  industrial policy by improving industrial structure, product  mix, and organizational setup of enterprises. As far as  industrial development is concerned, we should energetically  solve problems such as basic industries -- energy and  transportation in particular -- lagging behind the processing  industry, overdeveloped and underdeveloped sectors in the  processing industry, and low standards of specialization and  socialization of enterprises, so as to bring about a marked  improvement in the economic structure and to continually raise  efficiency through optimizing structure.    To ensure the organic combination of speed and efficiency,  it  is essential to promote scientific and technological progress  and improve the quality of the work force. It is crucial that  we rely on science and technology to educate and train a new  generation of people who have ideals, general knowledge, and a  sense of morality and discipline. We must be innovative in  applying science and technology, and must gradually develop our  own technology instead of relying mainly on imports so as to  reduce our gap in science and technology with the developed  countries.    To ensure the organic combination of speed and efficiency,  it  is necessary to strengthen the management and operation of  enterprises and strive to lower production costs. Commodities  have no national boundaries, and the key to opening up export  markets lies in improved quality. To this end, it is imperative  to set up a modern enterprise management system and practice  strict scientific management. It is also necessary to set eyes  on the internal management of enterprises, economize, and raise  labor productivity. In a sense, effective management can lead to  improved efficiency.    Bo Yibo emphasized: The road of development centering around  improved economic efficiency is an arduous and complicated  systems engineering project which requires our persistent  efforts, continuous exploration in the course of practice, and  summation of experiences in good time.    Lu Dong, chairman of the China Industrial Economy Society,  made a speech, entitled ""Work Hard To Open Up a New Situation in  Society's Work.""

The analyst says:    Japan has never let a chance pass by without saying the  production and stockpile of a large quantity of plutonium in the  country were for ""a peaceful purpose"" and it would not lead to  the conversion of Japan into a nuclear power. It has also  boastfully claimed that it is ""a model"" in accepting inspections  by the International Atomic Energy Agency. But it was fully  revealed this time that all this was a lie.    The analyst continues:    Pretending to open to the public the amount of stockpiled  plutonium, Japan has concealed a part of it. This proves that  it has invariably stepped up the design to turn itself into a  nuclear power under the cloak of ""a peaceful purpose.""    Broad public circles of the world have considered that  Japan's stockpile of plutonium more than necessary is related to  its design to become a nuclear power.    The Japanese authorities are now clamouring about  ""investigation"" and ""removal of misgivings."" This is, however, a  belated excuse.    Japan's nuclear design remains unchanged. It is racing  headlong toward nuclear armament.    Its nuclear armament poses a serious threat to the peace and  security in Asia and the rest of the world.     "

At least, this  is what is indicated by the initial data on industrial  production, which rose 6 percent last December compared to the  same month in 1992. This is the first positive result since  June 1992, apart from last August's result, which was highly  influenced by seasonal data. This good news is, nevertheless,  accompanied by the less tempting news on the public deficit:  There is talk of a 8 trillion lire hole in the this year's  public accounts. Yesterday, Treasury Undersecretary Sergio  Coloni explained that a minibudget would be ""inevitable,"" even  if Filippo Cavazzuti (of the Democratic Party of the Left,  [PDS]) poured oil on his own troubled waters, recalling the  positive effect that might result from the recovery.    So the driving forces behind industry are firing up again,  and this time it looks like they mean business. The data was  disseminated yesterday by ISTAT [Central Statistics Institute],  the national statistics office: Industrial production last  December, i.e., less than two months ago, rose 6 percent in one  year. This is a spectacular reversal of the trend if one simply  recalls that the production figures have been continually  negative since June 1992 -- more than a year and a half ago.  Not even the fact that in December 1993 there was one more day  of work than in December 1992 was enough to put this into  perspective: At ISTAT they explained that the data, which have  been adjusted to account for the extra day of work, remain  positive and point to a nice rise of 2.2 percent.    It is hard to figure out whether this is a weak or temporary  recovery, or a definitive revival. The pessimists are not  lowering their guard: They point out that these data are  comparable to those from late 1992, a disastrous period for our  economy. They add that businesses have not been overrun by  renewed and urgent demand, but are merely restoring their  inventories, that it is still exports which bring in the orders,  and that domestic demand -- even if it is peeping out here and  there -- is still in a deep and troubled sleep.    Yet something is moving. Judging by the data from  Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], which  arrived in late February of this year and which mentioned a  growth in production of 2 percent during the first two months of  1993, Italy should be on the point of chalking up a third  consecutive quarter of growth. That would suffice to say that  the worst is over and that the recovery is under way.    In its official statement, ISTAT mentioned ""signs of a  slowdown in the negative trend"" up until last August. The  institute's director, Paolo Garonna, spoke yesterday of an  ""important sign."" Meanwhile, Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio  Ciampi recently told EC Commission President Jacques Delors that  reportedly there were ""some signs of a turnaround in the trend""  and that ""the Italian economy is in a position to be among the  first to benefit from the recovery."" The figures bear him out:  in its semiannual report, ISCO [National Institute for the  Study of the Economic Situation], a research institute at the  Budget Ministry, spoke bluntly of recovery and growth in the  gross domestic product of 1.3 percent for this year.    However, apart from the export drive, another decisive  factor  will be the progress of domestic consumption, which is the  driving force in economic recovery. Last year, internal  consumption collapsed in Italy for the first time since the war.    So will Italians once again start dipping into their  wallets?  The sectors which ISTAT places in the front ranks when assessing  the December data are almost all export-oriented, but signs of  an internal recovery are also emerging in places: packaging,  small tools, shoes and purses, bottles and plastic packages,  office machines, and knitwear have shown signs of a strong  recovery. In major productive sectors, there is less anxiety.  At Federtessili [Italian Federation of Textile Workers Unions],  there is a certain amount of optimism. ""There has been a  turnaround since late last year,"" they say, ""but for the time  being we can only talk of stabilizing production activity.""  Unionplast, an association of producers of plastic articles,  has just calculated the data for its sales in 1993: They rose 3  percent. ""We are also feeling a bit of recovery in domestic  demand,"" Director Amilcare Bozzini noted, ""but it is primarily  exports to the United States and Germany that are going strong.  At Federmeccanica [Metal Workers and Mechanics Union  Federation] they are keen to point out that the metal and  mechanical industry is doing badly, but the metal products  sector has been recovering since late November. There is also  caution in the paper, printing, and publishing sector:  Newspapers and books are not taking off and only packing boxes  used for export goods are pulling the sector along.""    Will that suffice for the recovery? Working against it,  however, are the employment figure and the crisis in the major  industrial sectors, such as automobiles, where growth is  negative.     "

Industrial output fell 5.5 per cent compared with the month in 1991, according to figures published yesterday by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti). Despite the decline in production, inventories rose 6.2 per cent year-on-year. A senior official from the ministry said the figures indicated that the current economic downturn could last longer than had been expected. The government - including Miti - has been forecasting a recovery in the economy in the second half of the year. If inventory levels remain high, companies will be unwilling to raise output in time for the government's hopes to be realised. Mr Paul Summerville, an economist at Jardine Fleming, the securities house, said yesterday's figures were an unpleasant surprise. 'Production is falling but inventories are still rising. I don't know anyone who expected that at this stage.' On a month-to-month seasonally-adjusted basis, Japanese industrial production rose by 0.7 per cent, the first increase in seven months. However, shipments fell 0.5 per cent, indicating that demand is still weak. After falling steadily since the beginning of the year on a month-to-month basis, inventory levels did not change at all in April. The index of inventories to sales rose 0.7 per cent.

Sales for the month totalled Y191.9bn (Pounds 835m), with a reported 0.2 per cent increase from a year ago accounted for by the extra day in February this year. The figures provided further evidence that continued strong consumer spending may fail to underpin the otherwise weak Japanese economy, as many economists had hoped. Clothing sales were up modestly by 0.6 per cent, while household goods sales rose by 1.6 per cent. Foodstuffs sales were 7 per cent higher, while miscellaneous goods were off by 5.3 per cent. Sales of highly-priced items such as paintings were depressed. February steel production fell below 8m tonnes for the first time in four years, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said. Output fell by 11.7 per cent to 7.8m tonnes as weak demand forced companies to reduce inventories. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry also revised upward earlier estimates of inventories in January, which are now reported as 12.2 per cent higher than a year ago.

Exports of soybeans from these areas accounted for 30 percent  of the national total.    With the growth of agriculture, industry and the service  sector, the state-owned farms scattered in various parts of the  country such as Xinjiang, Heilongjiang and Yunnan produced a  gross domestic product of 84.4 billion yuan (over 10 billion  U.S. dollars) last year, with tax and profits amounting to 4  billion yuan, respectively 15 and 30 percent more than the  previous year.    The total farm production value is expected to be 26.3  billion yuan (about 3.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1993, a 4  percent increase over 1992. The farms' total production of  grain and soybeans was over 10 million tons last year.    Industrial firms owned by the farms produced a total  industrial value of 42.968 billion yuan (over 5.4 billion U.S.  dollars) in 1993, up 12 percent over 1992, and the sales volume  reached 40.967 billion yuan (about 5.12 billion U.S. dollars).    The service sector involving farm technology, commerce, real  estate and tourism also made headway.    The farms have set up 675 export-oriented enterprises.

Comparisons with the previous year have been distorted by the need in the 1991 accounts to write in L615bn plus interest repaid to IRI. This followed a ruling by the EC Commission that Finmeccanica had received illegal subsidies for its car divisions prior to the sale of Alfa Romeo to Fiat in 1986. As a result Finmeccanica posted a group loss of L525bn, but with this payment excluded the 1992 profits rose 11 per cent. The board is proposing a dividend of L140 for ordinary shares and L180 for savings shares, with L51bn going to reserves. The share of the results net of third party interests due to Finmeccanica is L126.3bn against L182.9bn in 1991. (Alenia, Ansaldo and Elsag-Bailey were incorporated after the close of the 1992 accounts). During the year turnover rose L112bn to L11,078bn, of which 40 per cent was accounted for by exports. This 1 per cent rise against inflation of 5 per cent reflected the downturn in a number of sectors, most notably defence. New orders topped L12,000bn compared to L10,318bn in 1991, and totalled L22,300bn. Financial liabilities rose 9 per cent to L5,310bn, equivalent to 47 per cent of turnover. Increased indebtedness was attributed to the difficulties of the civil aerospace business and the defence sector, plus the cost of group restructuring. Employment declined from 56,000 to 51,500.

The report containing the figures was accompanied by a strong warning from Lord Fraser, Scottish health minister, that it was not a league table of good or bad hospitals. He added: 'Still less is it about death league tables for Scottish hospitals. This report provides no direct comparisons between hospitals and health boards either in relation to the quality of care or the effectiveness of service.' Industrial areas of Scotland have one of the world's worst records for deaths from conditions such as heart disease and cancer. Many researchers are likely to see the figures as confirmation of the social and economic factors behind this poor health record, rather than a test of the performance of individual hospitals. The report does, however, show a range of differences between hospitals. Nearly 30 per cent of heart attack patients, for example, died within 30 days of being admitted to Fife Healthcare Trust compared with fewer than 16 per cent at Edinburgh Western General hospital. The Scottish average was 21 per cent.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

It is therefore necessary to continue to improve methodological  support of systems for measurement and control of air  environment. It is also important to control air pollution  levels (APLs) to prevent ecotoxicants (ETs) from entering the  personnel's organisms through inhalation. A procedure for  forming information on size distribution of aerosol particles  that can enter human body was developed. The methodological  principles are used for deriving matrices of forming measurement  information (MFMIs) are presented; estimates of the input of two  fractions to the distribution of aerodispersed ET carrierphase  are obtained as an example. Then the procedure is generalized to  the case of three to four fractions, by introducing additional  equations for constructing MFMIs. The procedure described in the  article is aimed at measuring air pollution in PSPEs using  impactors (devices that perform separation of aerosols by  dispersion fractions). It makes it possible to construct MFMIs  and estimate the input of individual consolidated dispersivity  ranges and total concentration, in order to control labor  conditions in an enterprise or to study new production processes  aimed at developing recommendations on improving the processes  in terms of their technological and hygiene criteria.

Amid growing signs that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will announce the end of the scheme in his Budget this month, Labour argued that vital health and safety legislation would be undermined and that many workers would be forced to take out private insurance. Scrapping the compensation scheme, which costs taxpayers Pounds 600m a year, would put the onus on employees to sue employers for negligence in order to gain compensation for injuries suffered in the workplace. 'We have already seen the government pass on the cost of sickness benefit and maternity benefit to the employer, and this is the next stage in that process,' said Mr Keith Bradley, a shadow social security minister. 'People injured at work may well find they are not employable, that whatever scheme is put in place does not cover their particular injury, or that the amount of compensation is so low that they will find themselves in severe hardship.' However, the move would appease rightwing Conservative MPs who are unhappy at the shelving of Post Office privatisation and who have accused the government of lacking credible and radical policies.

Higher profits and the optimistic note struck by the Swiss yesterday, though, should not raise expectations about what the men from Millbank can deliver. Tough conditions in pharmaceuticals are no surprise. Ciba sees CAP reform depressing demand for agrochemicals for three years at least. Although both companies are well out of petrochemicals, specialities will hardly be buoyant while the German and Japanese economies are moving down. Both companies are also in the throes of restructuring, which should yield cost benefits this year. But while Zeneca's first act as an independent company will be to make a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, Ciba promises a one-off boost to profits from the switch to international accounting standards. Moving from current cost to historical cost valuations will reduce Ciba's stated assets, resulting in a lower depreciation charge. Reported profits should rise by up to 10 per cent as a result of this and other accounting changes. There is also the thorny issue of hidden reserves - although Ciba refuses to say how much, if anything, could be released. Book-keeping changes are no substitute for real growth.

It is only by starting from  a study of the system, rules, policies, regulations, and  safeguards that we can acquire a deep knowledge of the causes of  corruption and perfect these things through deeper reform; it is  only in this way that we can accomplish dealing with both the  objective and its causes, implement comprehensive  administration, and fill in all the loopholes. There is no other  way out.    ""Financial Border"" Existed Early On    The rapid economic development of Mainland China has  attracted the world's attention, but so has the expansion of  corruption in every industry and circle. So, investigating graft  and other anti-corruption work, and encouraging clear and honest  administration has become a major item on the Chinese  Government's agenda. The ""lifeblood"" of mainland economic  operations, the financial industry, has over 17,000 grass-roots  units, over 800,000 employees throughout urban and rural China,  controlling the currency circulation business of all units on  the China mainland. It is just because this industry is in such  an important and special position that on 16 January 1990  Premier Li Peng issued this warning at the National Bank  Presidents Conference concerning a group of cases of graft,  accepting bribes, and theft which had appeared in financial  circles. The Premier said that: ""Information from every locality  shows that money worship is growing among some cadres and  employees on bank staffs... Some people inside the banks have  been corrupted by money, with frequent occurrences of graft,  theft, bribe-taking, and fund diversion. This kind of corruption  phenomenon deserves the strong attention of leaders at every  level. To push the anti-corruption struggle, they must adopt  efficient measures, conduct inspections, and deal with specific  cases, to expose a group of big and key cases..."" This has been  going on for more than three years. The presidency of the  People's Bank of China was changed from Li Guixian [2621 6311  7639] to a concurrent appointment for Vice Premier Zhu Rongji;  during that time, has the unhealthy tendency of ""financial  termites"" been stopped efficiently? The answer is  disappointing. Although the leaders of the Chinese Government  have worried so much, issued repeated warnings at all sorts of  conferences, and urged them time and again with good intentions  to investigate graft and clean up corruption, still, at the  National Financial Order Reorganization Conference in July of  this year, it was authoritatively disclosed that the corruption  phenomenon of some persons in the bank system taking advantage  of the industry to embezzle public funds was still expanding,  and the case of the ""silver dragon"" was quite prominent, leading  to extreme public dissatisfaction. Therefore, high ranking  leaders in China have repeatedly ordered the launching of  another anti-corruption struggle in financial circles in 1993:  ""We must determine to give considerable attention to making  major achievements,"" and ""lead the anti-corruption struggle into  a deeper level.""    ""Silver Dragon"" Shows New Characteristics    If we say that in the earlier years the ""thieves inside the  banks"" had grafted or taken bribes amounting for the most part  to several thousand yuan, or several ten thousand yuan, while  under the affects of the ""gold wind"" of ""seeking money"" by every  possible means in society, it has now developed to several  hundred thousand, several million, and even up to the insane  degree of several ten million yuan, which shows that the  corruption problem inside Mainland China's banks has indeed  reached a degree more serious than ever before. A document  issued jointly by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of China  and The Central Discipline Inspection Committee disclosed that  in the past three years, 37 new cases of graft were discovered  and handled within the banking system, involving a total of 220  million yuan. For ordinary graft, bribe-taking, embezzlement of  several thousands or several ten thousands, however, is flowing  in an endless stream, and it is hard to count the total amount  of money involved. The People's Bank of China, the Industrial  and Commercial Bank, urban credit unions, rural credit unions,  and insurance companies of financial units--none of these have  been involved in cases of this kind. For some ""silver dragons,""  their ""fierce mouths,"" which are swallowing huge sums of the  nation's prosperity, tend to be bigger each passing year, and  the records they have created grow more shocking year by year.  In 1990 there were nine especially large cases of graft, with  embezzlement of over 5 million yuan. The biggest case was the  Huzhou Industrial and Commercial Bank's Fenyang graft case in  Zhejiang, with graft amounting to 5 million yuan; in 1991, it  rose to 12 cases, an increase of three cases over the year  before. This time the person with the ""fierce mouth"" was Guo  Tingfeng [6753 1694 1496]: In his graft case in Cangnan County  Agricultural Bank in Zhejiang, the graft amounted to 14.28  million yuan. In 1992, it rose to 15 cases, an increase of three  cases over the year before; this time, the ""champion"" was Xue  Genhe [5641 2704 0735] of the Haikou Municipal Industrial and  Commercial Bank, with a graft amount of 33.44 million yuan.  Compared to him, criminals of the past two years suddenly look  like ""small wizards meeting big wizards.""    The current problem is, while these especially big criminals  have been discovered or dealt with, there are still a  considerable number of banking corruption phenomena of wide  scope which have yet to be discovered. The perpetrators continue  to change their strategems, pursuing personal gain through their  authority, exchanging that authority for money, extorting money  by means of their authority, falsifying records for the benefit  of relatives or friends, embezzling to make themselves rich,  taking sales commissions which are highly duplicitous, and  engaging in corruption. Here are some examples:    First, under the rubric of invigorating the economy and  supporting enterprises which invigorate capital, those who  extort money have developed from operating underground to  semi-overt. Many mainland enterprises lack capital and have  to pay ""labor fees"" in the thousands, even tens of thousands of  yuan when banks conduct ""inquiries""; this is then remitted into  the small treasuries of bank units, and is then distributed  underground under a collective title. In this way, time and time  again, units and their employees are tempted. A lot of ""first to  be rich"" employees of banks made more than 1,000 yuan a month  from various sources of income. No wonder a bank cadre told a  good friend privately that he ""only need use a little authority,  and we needn't worry about lack of money.""    Second, if benefits are not offered to those who want  to trade their authority for money, then they won't do business  with you. As a monopoly financial trader, such matters as  fixing project capital, giving loans, fund raising, collecting  and distributing foreign exchange, allocating circulating money,  issuing securities to the market, and discounting are all inside  its business scope. Since these units alone offer these  services, and no other agency, so they are sought out by  everyone. They charge for approving a document, and take ""labor  fees"" sales commissions for a signature, giving ""information,""  and stamping documents. If you do not give some side benefits to  bank representatives, even though your business is completely  legal and your reasons are abundant, it is still hard to pass.  So, exchange of authority for money has continued to rise in  recent years. It has risen from asking for dishes or sending  cigarettes to accepting valuable securities and financial gift  cards, and has now risen to take thousands and tens of thousands  in cash. There is a great deal of anger in enterprise circles,  but they find it difficult to speak out.    Third, the covert occupations of extortion and  blackmail. With the development of the mainland economy in  recent years, there has been an expanded demand for capital  requirement from all sides, with a growing tendency to ask for  credit loans, short term rebate loans, and fund raising in which  banks serve as representatives. Once an enterprise is able to  get an amount of money, the banks then demand one-thousandth of  the amount in cash as a ""service fee,"" which actually is a type  of disguised confiscation, with the excuse for collecting it as  so-called bank employee welfare. The mass of the people are  strongly dissatisfied with this kind of extortion activity.    Fourth, embezzlement of public funds for use in stock,  land, and real estate speculation. This is the most  outstanding phenomenon taking place in ""trust investment  corporations"" and ""security services corporations"" which are  attached to banks.    Fifth, investment in established companies, in the  attempt to make money in every way possible. In recent  years, there has been a ""craze for engaging in business  nationally"" on the Chinese mainland. This has also caused  confusion and disorientation among banking system cadres, who  feel ""they can't be rich if they don't engage in business,"" and  it became their way to ""pursue wealth."" So, all over the  nation, banks have gone into operating all kinds of ""companies""  and ""centers"" by using public funds; a lot of these suddenly  established companies got a ""lucky open."" Of these people who  ""plunged into the sea,"" some are current cadres, some are  retired cadres, or even their relatives and children. They not  only get the wages due them, which are perfectly justified, but  they also obtain various ""subsidies,"" ""labor fees,"" or  ""profits,"" which arouses jealousy among ordinary factory  employees. It is hard to determine the exact number of these  front companies, or just how many bank employees are involved  with them, even for high level leaders of the People's Bank of  China.    ""Inside Job"" Thieves Tend To Be Younger    An upsetting trend is that criminals in mainland financial  circles tend to be younger. In the last five years, the mainland  bank business has developed rapidly, absorbing many young  workers who usually come to the bank through school allocation  or by social employment, filling their retired parents'  positions. They have not been subjected to strict examination,  training, or intensified education, so the quality of their  business and their work ethic is not satisfactory. The rapid  development of domestic and overseas financial business put some  of them in certain leadership positions early, while some of  them never worked as leaders before, and now undertake  independent work assignments in a particular department. In  addition, although they lack social experience and a work ethic,  they deal with money every day, just at the time ""money worship""  is popular on the Chinese mainland. They always want to ""be  wealthy first of all."" It can be said that the greedy desire for  and pursuit of money are the most fundamental roots of increased  instances of corruption among young criminals in banks. Among  the 37 especially large cases mentioned above, over four-fifths  involved people less than 35 years old. The youngest one was  surnamed Jia [6328], a cashier at the International Trade Agency  of the Shenzhen Construction Bank, who when only 17 years old  grafted a total of more than US$27,000, HK$1.07 million, and  over 400,000 yuan. After the crime was discovered, the criminal  fled with this huge amount of money, and so far is still at  large. A cashier named Wu [0702], of the Rongqi Agency of the  Bank of China in Suide, Guangdong, only 26 years old, at one  time or another within a 40 day period stole over 500,000 yuan  RMB and HK$570,000, all of which went for gambling and leading a  life of debauchery. He was deserving of the term ""big termite.""    Weak Laws and Regulations    Financial work is done by accepting deposits, extending  credit, and settling accounts; it does these things by means of  currency, account matters, and documents. What is involved are  such forms of hard currency as currency, gold, and foreign  exchange. It is therefore extremely important to establish  perfect laws and regulations, efficient administrative rules,  and a strong system of administration. What upsets people is  that in the mainland banking system, which should be very  strictly managed, such phenomena as rules violations, ignoring  instances of these violations, lax management, and weak  supervision are common occurrences, shortcomings which can be  exploited in many places. An example is an accountant named Xue  [5641] of the Dongfeng Agency of the Haikou Municipal Industrial  and Commercial Bank, who took advantage of leadership trust,  chaotic management in the industry, and a lack of strict rules  to swallow up 250,000 yuan through three blank drafts. Initial  success made him bolder, so he took advantage of his position in  checking receipts, and arranged for a sealed secret escort. Over  time, he stole more than 20 blank bank drafts, as well as the  associated bank seal which was kept by a colleague. He then gave  these bogus bank drafts to outside criminals allied with him, to  secure payments from over 20 banks in more than 10 provinces and  municipalities, ultimately grafting funds totalling 33.44  million yuan. A cashier named Gu [7357] was Section Chief of the  No 1 Business Department of the Fuyang branch of the Anhui  Industrial and Commercial Bank, who shared the privilege of  entering and exiting the treasury house at will; even the rule  ""two people must be in charge of the treasury house,"" usually  absolute, was no restriction on him. After he acquired the bad  habit of gambling, he began thinking about the treasury house  and embezzled 7.70 million yuan. After the crime was discovered,  he said, very upset, ""If the bank management were a bit more  strict, I couldn't have pulled it off so smoothly."" So, we can  tell what degree of laxity exists in the mainland bank  management and supervision system.    Corruption Developed in Relationship Network    Although there has been definite reform of the banking  personnel system on the mainland in recent years, and there has  been a start on publishing invitations for jobs; still,  director-level positions at the provincial, municipal, and  county level are still assigned by higher level authorities.  Many people have done everything they can to remain in this  ""land of wealth"" after becoming financial officers, installing  their children and good friends in banking positions. Even if  they have received a public invitation for a job, some people  make certain arrangements under the table to let their  relatives, friends, or children of their superiors get through  the financial gate smoothly. From this, they form a network of  authority and money which influences mutual benefits, a network  in which if one is injured, all will be injured; if one goes  boom, all will, so much of the graft and corruption cannot be  exposed and dealt with efficiently. When several banks in  Beijing, Guangzhou, and Baotou were looking into questionable  persons, they all received telephone calls on these people's  behalf, hinting that there might be consequences for the banks.  So, behind some cases, there is not only just the ethics problem  of crime itself; the bigger problem of the relationship network  of appointing people by favoritism also plays a role here, and  this has developed their recklessness.    Obviously, as the mainland is in a transitional period of  changing from a planned to a market economy, the supporting laws  and regulations are not perfected yet, some policies are not  correct, and there are many weak links and shortcomings in the  work. All these things give ""bank termites"" a host of  opportunities to exploit for their own advantages, and the  anti-corruption struggle is facing a new, more serious  situation. It is only by starting from a perfected system of  rules, policies, laws and regulations and preventative measures  that we can then learn the deep-rooted causes which produce  corruption. Then we can make it perfect through deeper reform,  dealing with both the cause and the effect, and reorganize  comprehensively to block all loopholes. There is no alternative.     "

The deal, won against stiff competition from US and German rivals, is the second biggest contract won by Trafalgar House since its takeover of Davy, the process plant contractor, in 1991. It comes five weeks after Trafalgar House reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 30.3m for the year ended September 30 after exceptional property write-downs. Trafalgar House, which holds its annual meeting today, has stressed the benefits of acquiring a new 'leg' through Davy's metals and minerals plant contracting expertise. Early last year, it won a Pounds 140m contract for an aluminium strip plant in Egypt. The latest deal, won by Davy International, is a turnkey contract to rebuild Bethlehem's number two coke oven battery at its Burns Harbor, Indiana works. Mr Ian Robinson, chairman of Trafalgar House engineering division, said Bethlehem's investment showed its commitment to maintain its position as one of the leading integrated steel producers in the US. The outlook for steel plant contractors in the US was beginning to improve after a period where clients had been cutting back or delaying investments, he said. The plant is due for completion in early 1995, and will comply with the 1991 US Clean Air Act. Coking, where coal is turned into metallurgical coke for use in the blast furnace, is one of the most environmentally sensitive stages of the steelmaking process.   Companies:-  Trafalgar House.

Terms were not revealed but Mr Eberhard von Koerber, executive vice-president of ABB, said it was the largest of the 26 ventures so far established by the group in eastern Europe. The business being acquired has 4,000 employees and an annual turnover of Dollars 120m (Pounds 78.9m), as well as making a Dollars 13.2m net profit last year. It produces boilers and steam turbines, mainly for small industrial power plants with capacity up to 60MW. Mr Koerber said the level of engineering at PBS was fairly high and so the new company, ABB-Prvni brnenska strojirna BRNO, should quickly become 'a major pillar for low-cost manufacturing' within ABB's global network of power engineering plants. He saw it adding substantially to ABB's existing Dollars 600m-worth of annual business in the industrial plant sector, and expected it to grow quickly enough to avoid the need for redundancies either there or at other ABB plants. Mr Koerber said the purchase price to ABB, as in its other eastern European acquisitions, would consist of payments in cash and kind, and management and technology transfers. The remaining 33 per cent of ABB-PBS is being retained by PBS Holding, a recently-privatised group in which the Czech state still holds 51 per cent.   Companies:-  Prvni brnenska strojirna.

0,FT932-7119 ,"FT932-7119 _AN-DEYCHAGZFT 930525   FT  25 MAY 93 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (5): Things are improving - Profile: Rolls-Royce Power Engineering      By ANDREW BAXTER   It would be easy to conclude from a tour round the Parsons steam turbine factory at Heaton in Newcastle that one of the most illustrious names in the UK's rich history of heavy engineering triumphs is down on its luck. The factory is ticking over on a low level of activity, and some of the massive machine tools capable of handling a 300-tonne workpiece are being used on work for outside customers - now that the UK market for large coal-fired steam turbines has dried up. Parsons and its parent company, the recently renamed Rolls-Royce Power Engineering, have, indeed, just been through a rough patch. Overall employment has fallen about 40 per cent in 10 years, while Parsons' workforce has been halved to 2,500 since 1985. This is partly a reflection of the rationalisation of capacity throughout the power equipment industry, and especially in the European steam turbine business. But Parsons in particular was also badly hit by the Iraqi trade embargo, causing the cancellation of its Pounds 70m Al Shemal contract and the loss of 650 jobs. Bits of equipment for the order still languish at Heaton. Fortunately, Parsons' factory will soon be humming once again, as manufacturing begins in earnest on two orders now in the design stage. Last year Parsons won a Pounds 70m contract from Calcutta Electric for two 250MW steam turbine generators to be installed at the new coal-fired Budge Budge power station. Parsons also secured an order worth Pounds 100m to supply three 250MW steam turbine generators for Stage 3 of the Pulau Seraya power station in Singapore. Having built Stage 1 and then lost out to Japanese competition for Stage 3, the new order is the pay-off for all Parsons' recent efforts to improve its competitiveness. More orders are being chased, but meanwhile Mr Richard Maudslay, managing director of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, can claim that the power generation business is 'quite well loaded: much better than 12 months ago'. At Parsons, Mr Trevor Murch, managing director says: 'We have turned from a situation of some gloom and pessimism to one where we can continue building on these recent successes.' Over the next few months Parsons will even be recruiting some 300 new manufacturing workers. R-R PE can trace its history back to Sir Charles Parsons, the inventor of steam turbines, and more recently has been at the centre of the restructuring of UK heavy engineering. A merger in 1977 brought together Reyrolle Parsons (turbine generators, transformers, switchgear and control systems) and Clarke Chapman (boilers, water treatment plant, fossil and nuclear fuel handling systems) to form Northern Engineering Industries. NEI was itself bought by Rolls-Royce for Pounds 300m in 1989 in a move designed to protect the aero-engine group from the vagaries of the aerospace market. Subsequently, a deal with Asea Brown Boveri saw the creation of a UK joint venture, NEI ABB Gas Turbines. This allowed NEI to participate in the UK combined-cycle market, as it lacked a range of heavy-duty gas turbines. Then last year, Rolls-Royce and Westinghouse Electric announced an alliance covering technology transfer and marketing collaboration that is of far-reaching significance for both companies. And in February, some big changes were made to the corporate identity of companies within the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group. NEI's business is now conducted in the name of Rolls-Royce Power Engineering, and the NEI prefix has been removed from companies with historic names such as Parsons, Reyrolle, Peebles and Clarke Chapman. 'There were too many names,' says Mr Maudslay. Changes at R-R PE go a long way beyond the name. Over the past five years, the company has worked hard at rectifying problems which were reducing its competitiveness, especially in turnkey work. Mr Maudslay is frank about the errors of the past. Up to the mid-1980s, he says, the company lacked the management skills to bring in a project on time and on-budget. 'A tremendous amount of time and effort has been spent correcting that,' he says. He contrasts the company's performance on the Rihand power station project in India, where it made the mistake of signing the contract before the technical specification was clearly agreed, to its recent work converting the open-cycle gas-turbine Connaught Bridge power station in Malaysia to combined cycle operation. The Pounds 70m turnkey programme won by Parsons, was finished on time and on budget, and also brought work to other companies within R-R's Industrial Power Group. On the manufacturing side, the rationalisation included closure of the Parsons plant at Long Benton and a change in the make-or-buy policy to increase outsourcing of less critical components. At Parsons, some Pounds 70m was invested in the 1980s on manufacturing technology, and the rate is being maintained this decade, says Mr Murch. A new approach to manufacturing organisation, which Parsons calls 'systems engineering' has had a big impact on productivity. Having slimmed down to what Mr Maudslay calls an 'essential core,' R-R PE now has a stable base from which it can provide integrated solutions to customers. As long as it was concentrating internally on reducing its capacity, it tended to take a piecemeal approach to winning orders - the same customer would be visited separately by Parsons, Reyrolle etc. Mr Maudslay sees the overall strategy for R-R PE to be to select the market areas and product ranges where it can play to its strengths. In power generation this means building on its successful record in what have conventionally been called medium-sized steam turbines - 250-500MW - but which are now very much the standard size used in combined cycle power generation. Its regional priorities are the Middle East, India and the Far East. These are the areas with the strongest growth, says Mr Maudslay. The trend towards private power in India and several fast-growing markets in Asia increases the chances of countries' power ambitions being realised, and, via Rolls-Royce  Partners Finance, Mr Maudslay is prepared to take equity stakes in projects. 'But I don't see us taking a major share in a major project,' he cautions. Looking ahead, Mr Maudslay attaches considerable importance to the tie-up with Westinghouse. The attraction he says, is the big mutual interest in a deal for both companies. Westinghouse gets aero-engine derivative technology for its gas turbines, while Rolls-Royce gets access to Westinghouse's heavy duty gas turbine range. The companies will work together on marketing, with either leading a bid depending on each other's market strengths. Co-operation in steam turbine technology development has already begun - 'it did not make sense for each to develop its own products,' he says. The agreement with Westinghouse excludes the UK because of the NEI-ABB joint venture, but this looks to be declining in importance for R-R PE overall, perhaps because it lacks the necessary element of mutual interest. Even in the UK, its prospects look uncertain as the market for gas turbines turns cooler.   Companies:-  Rolls-Royce Power Engineering.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT933-12920 ,"FT933-12920 _AN-DGVCBAA4FT 930722   FT  22 JUL 93 / Meanwhile in Belgrade, only the mint works: Sanctions-wracked economy sees inflation nearing 700% a month      By LAURA SILBER   THE SIGNS in Belgrade's supermarkets warn: 'Caution, prices are one thousand times higher than marked.' After more than two years of footing the bill for wars in neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia and 13 months of United Nations sanctions, the Serbian economy has reached a new low. 'Even God almighty could not help turn the economy around,' says Mr Ljubomir Madjar, a Belgrade University economics professor. It will get worse. However, analysts are divided over whether the Serbian people are close to the point where they will turn against their government and demand an end to its support for what the rest of the world regards as Serb aggression in Bosnia. The dinar, the Yugoslav national currency, is collapsing by the hour. The 5m dinar note, the highest denomination, is worth about 50 German pfennings. New denominations of 10m and 50m dinars will be issued on Monday. The D-mark yesterday was valued at about 21m dinars for bank giro transactions. In a speech recently to government officials, Mr Vojislav Tomic, director of the state treasury, said: 'The country is in the most difficult situation in its history . . . the mint is working on three shifts printing bills non-stop, but there is still not enough cash.' Cashiers and accountants throw up their hands in despair, hard-pressed to keep track of the astronomical figures, often in the thousands of millions: Inflation in June was 366.7 per cent. Economists this month estimate that prices are rising at about 12 per cent a day, a monthly rate of 690 per cent. Industrial output fell by 41.9 per cent in the first five months of this year. This followed a 21.4 per cent drop in 1992. Gross national product per head has shrunk from Dollars 3,060 in 1989 to Dollars 350. Serbia currently allocates 20 per cent of its shrinking GNP in aid to Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, although economists believe the real figure is closer to 40 per cent. Some 60 to 70 per cent of Serbs live below the poverty level. A typical basket of consumer goods costs Dollars 60, but the average monthly salary is half that, says Mr Miroljub Labus, a Belgrade University economics professor and opposition deputy in the federal parliament. Electricity prices have been raised 512 per cent this month alone. More than half of Serbia's factories have temporarily closed; some economists say the rest may shut this autumn. The government of what remains of Yugoslavia this month minted an estimated 400,000bn dinars to purchase summer wheat. But farmers, most of whom immediately converted sackloads of dinars into hard currency on the black market, still lost on the transaction. Many have refused to sell their crops as a result and there will be shortages this winter. In Serbia's fertile northern province of Vojvodina, private bakers say they are going on 'holiday' rather than accept the miserable government price controls for bread. Government-imposed controls, rather than the sanctions, appear to have given rise to chronic shortages of flour, milk and cooking oil. As bad as it looks, however, Serbs tend to compare themselves with their neighbours who, in a state of war, are even worse off. 'The scenes on television of destruction and death acts as a warning not to react in protest against the situation,' Mr Tomislav Popovic, a Belgrade economist has said. Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, blames the mess on the sanctions, channelling popular anger towards the west. In the state-controlled press, sanctions are mentioned only in concert with the word 'unjust'. Most Serbs see the sanctions, including an oil embargo, as incomprehensible. They believe Serbs are fighting a war of self-defence. For example, western newspapers yesterday reported how Serb forces had launched an offensive on Mount Igman near Sarajevo, while Serbian state-controlled newspapers reported that the Moslems were continuing their fierce offensive. Meanwhile, smuggling and speculation have to some extent made up for the emptying store shelves. Most city dwellers appear to survive by living off their country cousins. 'People at the market simply hang around waiting for their relatives to finish the work day. They know that their cousins, no matter how distant, will give them what's left,' says one pensioner. In the last few weeks, discontent has led to employees staging widespread industrial action, including rail workers from Montenegro, air traffic controllers from Belgrade and car workers from the giant Zastava car plant in Kragujevac and its small arms division. Mr Madjar says: 'The sanctions are like a time bomb. The reserves will run out. Then the factories will stop one by one. . . .'   Countries:-  YUZ  Yugoslavia, East Europe.

0,FT931-3376 ,"FT931-3376 _AN-DCPCCAGTFT 930316   FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: US storm damage      By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON   The massive damage wrought by what are seen as the worst storms across the east coast of the US this century led to an initial marking down of a UK composite insurance sector buffeted in recent years by a series of natural disasters, capped by last year's Hurricane Andrew. But the markdown and ensuing selling pressure proved shortlived as insurance specialists concentrated instead on the likelihood that the latest disasters would trigger the long-awaited upturn in US insurance premiums. The performance of shares in the biggest US insurance groups when Wall Street opened gave credence to London's view that premiums would almost certainly be raised. General Re was up around Dollars 2 5/8 , Marsh  McLennan 1 1/8 firmer and AIG over a point higher shortly after the US market opened. General Accident, whose US catastrophe reinsurance is triggered if losses rise above Dollars 40m, was seen as possibly the worst affected, and the shares settled 8 off at 589p. Royal, with a reinsurance trigger level of Dollars 25m, rallied sharply to end 9 ahead at 305p after an early fall to 293p. Commercial Union, with a reinsurance mark of Dollars 15m, managed a minor rise to 607p. Sun Alliance, which has negligible exposure to the US, rose 11 to 350p. Industrial group IMI, which reported a decline in profits, moved sharply forward, with the market cheered by the held dividend. The shares gained 11 at 270p in trade of 3.3m. In spite of an upbeat analysts meeting, many remained sceptical about the prospects for the current year and several moved to downgrade full year profit expectations. These Included Mr Sandy Morris at NatWest Securities, who trimmed his 1993 estimate by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 71.5m. He blamed the cut on the continued weakness in the rest of Europe, where the company derives around 37 per cent of operating profits, and IMI's moderate exposure to the recovering US economy. The signing of a joint venture agreement for cigarette production in the Ukraine led to positive sentiment in BAT and the shares put on 8 at 956p. Transfer Technology continued to be the subject of strong demand, following the recent favourable figures. The shares added 33 at 558p. Vague hints of a sell recommendation for Gestetner left the shares 12 lighter at 118p. English China Clays rose 5 to 458p after reporting a maintained dividend. British Airways firmed 3 to 298p ahead of confirmation that its Dollars 300m investment into USAir has been cleared by the US government. Volume came to 3m shares. Bid talk returned to a generally positive property sector, with Hammerson once again the name touted as a possible target. However, one dealer suggested that a stock shortage in one type of the group's shares had triggered buying in the other as the two had moved apart, inflating the rise. By the close the ordinary shares had jumped 21 to 387p and the 'A's 26 to 361p. The building materials sector, among the market's worst performing areas last week, staged a good rally amid hopes of a cut in German interest rates. Wolseley moved ahead 17 to 583p, RMC 12 to 588p and Redland 10 to 455p. Second line store issues did some catching up after Friday's strong session for the leaders. T  S Stores rose 5 to 164p, Amber Day 6 to 62p and Body Shop 6 to 190p. The decision by Argos to close its loss-making Chesterman furniture stores lifted the stock 9 to 295p. There was renewed bid talk around Geest and the shares jumped a further 12 to 480p. A US food group is rumoured to be on the prowl. Weekend press comment benefited Perkins Foods, up 7 at 113p, and United Biscuits, ahead 5 at 383p. A buy note from Paribas on Queens Moat Houses helped the shares advance 4 to 49p in turnover of 5.6m. The French-owned broker believes recent weakness to be overdone and that the stock is poised for recovery. Two small but loss-making leisure stocks, European Leisure and Whitegate Leisure, both moved back into the black. The former rose 1 1/4 to 5 1/2 p and the latter 5 to 27p. The recent run of big turnovers in Amstrad continued, with 11m traded yesterday as the stock gained 2 1/2 at 38p - its highest level since June last year. This week sees the expected launch of the company's latest new product, a 'personal digital assistant' computer. Delta advanced 9 to 444p following the maintained dividend, while GEC rallied after last week's slide and settled 6 1/2 ahead at 300p; Phillips  Drew Fund Management said it no longer had a notifiable interest in GEC shares.

The finding was the first step of an anti-dumping inquiry involving magnesium imports from China, Russia and Ukraine. The case now goes to the commerce department, which will investigate whether the metal was sold at unfairly low prices in 1993. If it decides dumping occurred, the ITC would be asked to make a final determination of injury and countervailing duties could be collected. The complaint was brought by Magcorp and two labour unions at the end of March. Magcorp and the unions say the fair price for magnesium from the three nations was from Dollars 1.41 to Dollars 1.49 per pound, but Russia sold magnesium for as low as 41 cents per pound. The ITC said imports of pure and alloy magnesium from China and Russia should be investigated. They also supported an investigation of pure magnesium from Ukraine but rejected an investigation of alloy-grade magnesium from that country. Pure magnesium is used in making aluminum and in desulfurisation. Alloy-grade magnesium is used in die casting. Imports of magnesium surged from 1991-93 and prices fell. Shipments from the three nations totalled 23,758 metric tons in 199. The complaint was the second time US producers have moved against a flood of metals exports from former Soviet states. In the other instance, they acted in concert with other nations to curb voluntarily global aluminium production.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Industrial companies such as National Power, which has a 25 per cent stake in the project, are increasingly keen to provide some of the finance themselves. But there are competing views about how best it should be channelled. One route is that being taken by Welsh Water. It is looking to raise around Dollars 100m from half a dozen industrial partners and a further Dollars 400m from institutions. The fund would provide equity for projects identified by the industrial partners. They would get a return on their investment as well as an outlet for their products and services. Though attractive for the partners, such a structure raises the possibility of conflicts of interest. Institutional backers need to be satisfied their investment will not be used to subsidise industrial partners' sales. US General Electric's efforts to raise Dollars 2.5bn for a fund to invest in third world power projects are thought to have been hampered by such concerns. On the other hand, companies such as GE can deliver the flow of deals the fund needs. Tiger Management, the US hedge fund, recently failed to raise Dollars 1bn for infrastructure investment because of its perceived lack of experience in Asia. Other institutional funds are complaining about a lack of suitable projects. But this may say more about their expertise than the investment opportunities.   Companies:-  National Power.

Revenues for the quarter were down marginally at Dollars 9.7bn, against Dollars 9.75bn. For the whole of 1992 Texaco's net profit slumped 45 per cent to Dollars 712m or Dollars 2.37 per share. However, this figure included a Dollars 300m charge for changes in accounting principles. Revenues for 1992 were Dollars 37.7bn, down from Dollars 38.3bn in 1991. Mr James Kinnear, outgoing Texaco chief executive, said that beyond special charges, the decline in 1992 profits occurred primarily from soft market conditions for refined products, crude oil market conditions and a generally difficult business environment. But he added that Texaco realised cash savings of about Dollars 500m in 1992 from reductions in operating and overhead expenses. Texaco said its fourth-quarter operating income before taking the charges was Dollars 416m, up from Dollars 295m in the last quarter of 1991. Despite tax benefits of Dollars 40m, the fourth-quarter net profit was depressed by special charges, including a special write-off of Dollars 34m caused by property damage from a fire at Los Angeles refinery and Hurricane Andrew. In addition, there were Dollars 58m of payments for staff severance and Dollars 64m for charges associated with asset-writedowns and reserves for environmental clean-up matters.

The report, published yesterday is the latest and most critical in a series commissioned by Cumbria County Council from Environmental Resources. It suggests that groundwater from the repository could reach the surface in around 300 years. Cautioning however against attaching too much significance to this calculation, the report says that only further investigation will show if the site is safe. The report criticises the timetable proposed by Nirex, the nuclear waste consortium, as unrealistically short, and says the application for the repository, to be built half a mile underground and to operate for 50 years, will be made before a complete assessment of information can be provided. Nirex yesterday criticised calculations in the report as 'off-beam'. It said the Sellafield site continued to 'show promise as a repository location' and the claim it was a poor site was not supportable. British Nuclear Fuels admitted yesterday that it had made errors in figures in its application to operate a new reprocessing plant in Sellafield. The errors were announced only four days before the end of an eight-week consultation period for objections to new radiation discharge levels for the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) to be received. That period will be extended by two weeks following the release of the amended figures on the discharge of radioactive gas.   Companies:-  UK Nirex.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Their report, which is a basis for the government's long-term nuclear energy policy, follows growing domestic and international concern over Japan's surplus of plutonium, a highly toxic fuel that can be used for nuclear weapons. Japan's nuclear recycling programme was adopted in the 1950s when plutonium was regarded as a 'dream fuel'. The country's first prototype fast-breeder, named Monju and based on the west coast, began a self-sustaining reaction last month, using plutonium produced at processing plants in Britain and France. Japan's first reprocessing plant, in northern Japan, is due to start operating at the end of the decade. Until recently Japan has resisted calls from domestic and international environmental groups for curbs on its programme. However, mounting accusations that Japan intended to build nuclear weapons increased government anxiety. While the report calls only for a delay in various projects linked to plutonium use, and not cancellation, it is a severe blow to the country's nuclear lobby. The report proposes: Postponement of the decision to build a second nuclear fuel reprocessing plant until the year 2010, instead of launching the plant that year; Moving back the target date for when plutonium fast breeders will be put to commercial use by 10 years to 2030; Postponement of construction of the first demonstration fast breeder reactor to early next century; Delay to plans to construct more than 20 light-water reactors by 2010 by about 20 years.

The total value of household products produced in Taiwan has  dropped to US$210 billion in 1993 from US$250 billion five years  ago, the statistics showed.    Taiwan's household product industry groups businesses which  produce shoes, giftware, toys, adhesives and tape, jewelry,  sporting goods, educational products, and the printing industry.    Shoe manufactures registered the largest decline of the  group, dropping 50 percent from US$110 billion in 1989 to US$55  billion in 1993.    IDB officials attributed the large decline in shoe  production  values to the mass relocation of OEM (original equipment  manufacturing) factories, which in turn decreased export value.    Both the giftware and sporting goods industries also showed  declines of 33 percent and 14 percent respectively.    However, the printing and adhesive industries grew 32  percent  and 100 percent each during the period. The adhesive industry  grew from US$5 billion in 1989 to US$10 billion in 1993 while  the printing industry increased from US$38 billion five years  ago to US$50 billion, the statistics showed.    Increases in domestic demand fueled the growth, the  officials  added.    The production value of Taiwan's toy industry was also up 21  percent, totaling US$24.5 billion, the statistics showed.    IDB officials said that although the relocation of  industries  and increasing production costs undermined competitiveness,  improvements in the industrial structure and the upgrading of  technology helped the industry remain profitable.    More than 1.32 million people are employed in Taiwan's  household products industry.     "

Hydro International, a market leader in using 'vortex technology' for low-cost storm control and sewage treatment, is going public next month through a Pounds 4m placing and full listing. After 14 years of battling to win acceptance for its technology, the Clevedon, Avon-based concern sees opportunities to accelerate its growth through international expansion and development of new markets. Hydro's products use a vortex - a kind of whirlpool effect which can be harnessed to regulate fluid flows - for two main product ranges, flow control valves for flood protection and storm control, and hydro dynamic separators, for separating solids from liquids, especially in the treatment of sewage and other waste water. The company is hoping to benefit from recent environmental legislation demanding sharp reductions in the level of pollutants that can be discharged into seas, lakes, rivers and other water courses. Mr Tim Lamb, managing director, said about 35 per cent of the Pounds 24bn expected to be spent by the UK water and sewage industry up to 2005 is in areas in which the company operates. Hydro had sales last year of Pounds 4.1m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 156,000, expected to rise this year to about Pounds 5m and Pounds 400,000 respectively. Profits may dip next year because of research and development spending, Mr Lamb said. After the placing, which is being handled by Allied Provincial, about 30 per cent of Hydro's shares will be in public hands.   Companies:-  Hydro International.

The wording of the definition of this term has been revised editorially from the definition in the proposal for consistency with NFPA 306.

The contract, which the company yesterday said is backed by the Taiwanese government and would be worth 'quite a few millions' over several years, may make more difficult a decision by General Motors on whether to sell Lotus. GM has owned Lotus since 1987. Several interested parties have approached GM about the purchase of all or parts of Group Lotus, including a management team led by Mr Adrian Palmer, the managing director. GM has not disclosed details of the other approaches, which followed a decision last year to abandon production of the Elan small sports car after less than two years. Lotus had hoped to sell 3,000 a year but the car was widely regarded as too expensive and never came close to sales targets. As a result Lotus Cars, the carmaking division which now produces only the very low volume Esprit 'supercar', has been making heavy losses for the past two years. It now employs only 200 people - one third of 1991 levels. Lotus Engineering, the consultancy division which has won the Taiwan contract, earned more than Pounds 30m in 1991 and is understood to have made substantial profits last year, although figures have yet to be released. The division is now substantially larger than the carmaking side of the business, with 500 employees.

The official stated that, following discussions between  Secofi authorities and Mexican manufacturers, ""very few articles  will undergo tariff exemptions adjustments, since the position  adopted by Mexican manufacturers and farmers is not to negotiate  with respect to this aspect.""    Yesterday, Herminio Blanco participated in hearings by the  Senate's Trade and Industrial Development and Foreign Relations  Commissions in which he provided an explanation with respect to  the status of the free trade agreement between Mexico and Costa  Rica.    Departing from the hearing's agenda, Angel Sergio Guerrero,  Durango State PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] senator,  said that lowering duties in advance on 155 items included in  the TLC -- announced in the 22 May Official Gazette -- ""would be  similar to substantially modifying the North American Free Trade  Agreement [NAFTA], which is of concern since adjustments have  been suggested by one of the parties to the agreement."" The  senator asked: What's the reason for this attempt to propose  tariff exemptions in advance?    The Secofi official explained to the PRI senator that ""there  should be no apprehensions because the treaty allows lowering  tariffs in advance if requested by one of the parties and if the  other two are in agreement.""    Blanco added that Secofi had analyzed the issue ever since  the announcement was published in the Official Gazette. He also  indicated that Secofi is expected to conclude discussions on the  issue by 23 June. However, Blanco pointed out that the position  adopted by the country's productive sector is not to negotiate  lowering tariffs in advance.    Under Secretary Blanco stated that of the 155 items on which  tax exemptions had been proposed ""per Mexico's request,"" 107  were proposed by Mexico, 43 by the United States, and seven by  Canada. These items represent a ""relatively low bilateral trade  flow,"" which represents 3.8 percent of Mexico's exports to the  United States and 2.8 percent of U.S. sales to Mexico.    The U.S. counterpart, Blanco added, requested tariff  exemptions for items such as potatoes, beans, cheese, and wine.  However, Mexican growers pointed out that exemptions in advance  are unthinkable in these cases. Hermino Blanco explained to the  senators that the final outcome of this process will be that  ""very few items will receive tariff exemptions before the dates  established by the free trade agreement.""    In a meeting with federal representatives, Hector Teran, a  PAN [National Action Party] member and Baja California senator,  indicated that along the northern border ""there are problems  realizing the benefits of the free trade agreement."" He also  voiced his doubts with respect to the ever-growing trade  deficit's being profitable to the country, saying that, on the  contrary, the imbalance in the exchange of goods could undermine  the currency's parity during the next few months.    In reply, Blanco pointed out that the trade deficit, which  totaled $4.317 billion during the first quarter, is natural and  indicated that Mexico is a country that imports capital goods  and raw materials essential to its development. He added that  this past April, for the first time, monthly exports to the  United States surpassed $4 billion. He also proposed that  Secofi exercise more vigilance in order to expedite export  transactions, although he insisted that, regarding deregulation,  ""many things have changed favorably.""    During the hearing, which was presided over by Hidalgo  Senator Humberto Lugo Gil, PRI bloc coordinator in the Chamber  of Senators, 10 legislators intervened to request more  information with respect to the free trade agreement between  Mexico and Costa Rica signed this past 5 April by both nations'  presidents.    In his presentation before the question and answer period,  Herminio Blanco Mendoza pointed out that, as a result of the  agreed upon trade liberalization program, Mexico will be able to  export, starting on the day the treaty comes into force, all  goods that Costa Rica does not produce. Thus, 70 percent of  nonagricultural Mexican sales to that nation and 75 percent of  Costa Rican exports to Mexico will be tariff-free.    In reply to a question by Morelos Senator Angel Ventura  Valle, the Secofi official said that agricultural exports from  Costa Rica to Mexico will not harm national production. Costa  Rican coffee and plantains were excluded from the agreement, and  the elimination of tariffs on Costa Rican corn and beans will be  implemented in 15 years, he added.    Sinaoloa Senator Gustavo Guerrero said that produce growers  in his state worry about the possibility of illegal  transshipment of tomatoes, potatoes, lettuce, and other produce  from the United States to Mexico. Blanco Mendoza said that the  rules on the origin of products specified in the agreement are  clear. He added that Mexican authorities, in coordination with  national producers, will ensure that this type of illegal  practices do not occur.    Herminio Blanco Mendoza said that the trade agreements  reached on the American Continent in past years constitute a  firm step toward the establishment of genuine regional trade  integration. ""After decades of speeches there is finally  progress,"" he added.     "
0,FT933-11070 ,"FT933-11070 _AN-DHAABAAZFT 930731   FT  31 JUL 93 / Italy gropes through bribes maze      By ROBERT GRAHAM      ROME   THE mother of all bribes paid out in Italy's corruption scandals is now known to be L135bn (Pounds 56m). Breaking the wall of silence surrounding this payment to political parties, individual politicians, businessmen and middlemen has been a central objective of Milan magistrates since the beginning of the year. The payments relate to the 'Enimont affair' - the abortive attempt in 1989-90 to reorganise the chemicals industry by merging public sector interests of Eni, the state oil concern, with private sector assets of Montedison, the Ferruzzi group's chemicals arm, in a joint venture, Enimont. Milan magistrates were convinced the murky background to the Enimont affair would expose the extent to which the government, controlled by Christian Democrats and Socialists, subverted Italy's business life to their own illicit ends. If the allegations, leaked by magistrates over the past 24 hours, are proved correct, discrediting of the political establishment will be complete. The magistrates appear satisfied they have got what they want. Two key witnesses in the Enimont affair - Mr Giuseppe Garafano, former Montedison chief executive, and Mr Carlo Sama, his successor, who is married to a daughter of the founder of the Ferruzzi emp-ire - have been secretly released from jail. This emerged yesterday, though they were released to house arrest on Thursday. Milan magistrates have adopted a policy of keeping people in jail on corruption charges until they confess. Mr Garofano was arrested in Switzerland on July 13 and extradited with unprecedented speed two days later. Mr Sama was arrested on Friday last week, the day when Mr Raul Gardini, his brother-in-law and former head of Montedison, committed suicide  -the fourth in the Enimont affair. Mr Gardini is alleged to have arranged a first bribe of L15bn, paid to the Christian Democrats and Socialists in 1989 to ensure Montedison got tax breaks when it merged its chemical interests with those of Eni to form Enimont. The big bribe came when Mr Gardini broke his pact with Eni over joint control of Enimont. Unknown to Eni, then run by Mr Giuseppe Cagliari, who also committed suicide last week, Mr Gardini acquired 11 per cent of the outstanding 20 per cent of Enimont through three associates. Eni found out and persuaded a Milan court to freeze Enimont's shares. These were then placed in the custody of Mr Vincenzo Palladino, currently deputy chairman of Banca Commerciale Italiana. To extricate himself, Mr Gardini offered to sell Montedison's 40 per cent stake to Eni. For this Eni paid L2,805bn - now believed to be at least L600bn above the real value. Eni paid a further L1,360bn for minority shareholders, including Mr Gardini's associates. In return there was a political pay-off of L100bn plus Dollars 20m. This amount is believed to relate to 5 per cent of Montedison's real profits on the Enimont stake sale to Eni. Montedison was able to pay over the funds through off-balance-sheet operations, phoney property deals and transactions between foreign subsidiaries. Milan magistrates are understood to have warned eight senior politicians they are under investigation for being involved in this alleged payment. Mr Arnaldo Forlani, Christian Democrat leader at the time, has already got such a warning, in which he is alleged to have received L35bn. Mr Bettino Craxi, then leader of the Socialist party which regarded the oil and chemicals industry as its fiefdom, is alleged to have got a staggering L75bn. He, too, denies involvement, but yesterday admitted the party had received political contributions from both Montedison and the Ferruzzi group as a whole. The rest of the funds were allegedly handed to Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, a senior Christian Democrat minister and close ally of the then premier, Mr Giulio Andreotti; and Mr Claudio Martelli, the Socialist deputy prime minister. To smooth the deal, it is alleged Mr Pallidino, who was supervising the frozen Enimont shares, was bribed L2.5bn. He was arrested on Thursday, but his laywer yesterday denied this sum was a bribe and said it was a professional fee from Montedison. It is further alleged share dealings during the Enimont affair were smoothed by the help of Mr Bruno Pazzi, head of Consob, the Milan stock exchange watchdog body. Mr Pazzi, an appointee of Mr Andreotti, was arrested in connection with Enimont on Wednesday. Even after Montedison pulled out of Enimont, Ferruzzi-Montedison went on paying the politicians - allegedly handing out up to L7bn for the April 1992 elections to the five parties that formed the government coalition during the Enimont affair. The Republican Party yesterday admitted to receiving L300m to this effect. Eni is still in arbitration with Montedison over what it claims to be over-valued chemical plant brought by the latter into the Enimont joint venture.   Companies:-  Enimont.     Montedison.

No-one died in the blaze in July 1992, but more than 30 people were taken to hospital. The blaze cost the company at least Pounds 10m. The fire could have been prevented if two incompatible chemicals, which formed a highly flamable explosive mixture, had not been stored together, the Health and Safety Executive said. 'This was a major fire which was waiting to happen given the circumstances,' HSE area director Ms Norma Collins said, launching a report on the blaze. She said the company 'had stored incompatible chemical substances together, chemicals which should never be stored together because of their dangerous properties'. She added: 'It is deplorable that the cause of the fire was well known throughout the industry and there had been previous advice and guidance. The company's management systems left a lot to be desired in relation to safe operating procedures. 'We have to ensure that arrangements for dealing with emergencies of this nature are adequate.' The company said it had taken on board all the lessons and was implementing safety procedures, and new warehouses were being built.

The case alleges that the European Commission broke its own rules by approving the aid earlier this year. European manufacturers argue the Pounds 157m plant will add to capacity and threaten jobs in an already over supplied sector. The Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board, which is responsible for the project, said last night that it could not comment until the court had formed a view on the case. Hualon was unavailable for comment at its headquarters in Taipei. Hualon has recently reaffirmed its commitment to the proposed plant, which it says will create 1,800 jobs in Belfast. However, the filing of the case raises further uncertainties about the project. The start of the project has already been delayed several months to allow time for appeals to the Commission's decision. It is unclear whether Hualon will wish to proceed until the court rules, which is not expected for at least 18 months. The IDB said yesterday building work on the proposed plant had yet to begin, and it had disbursed none of the grant to Hualon. The European Court case has been brought by Aiuffas, an organisation of European filament weaving companies, and the Apparel, Knitting and Textiles Alliance, the lobbying arm of the British Textiles and Apparel Confederation.

0,FT944-4867 ,"FT944-4867 _AN-ELFDIAHBFT 941206   FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (9): Success has whittled away Miti's powers - Emiko Terazono examines industrial policy      By EMIKO TERAZONO   A poll taken last year by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese leading business daily, revealed that Japan's leading bureaucrats thought the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) was third on the list of insignificant ministries and government agencies, following the Hokkaido Development Agency and the Food Agency. Miti was once one of the most powerful institutions in Kasumigaseki, Japan's Whitehall, orchestrating the country's industrial policy in close co-operation with the business sector. However, now that Japan's has achieved economic success and the role of industrial policy in economic development has diminished, the ministry has been marginalised among even clannish bureaucrats. Many economists agree that Miti's interventionist policy - based on identifying key growth industries, supporting them with enormous investment programmes and protecting them from foreign competition - has been largely successful. Industries such as petrochemicals, cars and electronics flourished under the wing of Miti in the 1960s and 1970s. But economic success has whittled away Miti's powers. The rising strength of corporations has reduced the influence of the government's industrial policy, while the ministry's role of selecting and promoting industries has been limited by foreign pressure on Japanese exports. 'The ministry is a little like a poverty agency that has actually succeeded in eliminating poverty,' says Mr Chalmers Johnson, professor of University of California, Berkeley, and author of Miti and the Japanese Miracle. Increased criticism from businesses over informal administrative guidelines have also reduced the ministry's power. In the past, ministries such as Miti could withhold licences and legal permissions from businesses that did not follow the guidelines. However, rules governing administrative approval procedures, introduced to make the process more transparent, have made it difficult for bureaucrats to wield influence. The ministry is also losing out in a power struggle with the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) which began in the early 1980s for control over new potential growth sectors - namely the telecommunications and multimedia industries. Mr James Vestal, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo and author of Planning for Change, a book which analyses the role of Miti, says that while its success in the 1950s provides lessons for developing countries, the argument that the west has something to learn from Japan's industrial policies now, is questionable. He claims that there is little scope for industrial policy in solving the middle term issues which the country's economy faces. The biggest problem, unbalanced growth, comes as a result of corporate interests being placed over those of the consumer. The lack of emphasis on consumption has led to a surplus of domestic savings over domestic investment which is at the root of the country's chronic current account surplus. The underlying cause has been the willingness of Japanese workers to put the interests of the company before their own. Industrial or macro-economic policy cannot deal with this issue. Only a radical change in the way Japanese see themselves in relation to their employers will resolve it. Nor can industrial policy solve the demographic changes which will soon hit Japanese economic growth. Pollution, another big problem, is also an issue which needs tackling outside industrial policy. The lack of industrial models also makes it hard for the country to identify potential growth industries. Since Japan cannot follow other examples of industrial development, it is on equal standing with other industrialised countries in investing and promoting the development of new technologies. In its search for a new role, the ministry has started to undo its past policy failures. In the early 1980s it moved to save jobs in the petrochemical industry by organising a cartel of Japan's producers. This has left the industry fragmented with inefficient operations and costly products. Aerospace, another industry that Miti has promoted since the 1960s, is also being reviewed. The ministry is now promoting restructuring in the petrochemicals industry, encouraging mergers and cutting costs. Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi Petrochemical merged last October and Asahi Kasei is also undergoing rationalisation. Miti has decided to side with the consumer, shifting from its role as promoter of industry. Miti has backed the country's product-liability law which will protect consumers against defective products. The bill passed parliament last June after nearly 20 years of debate. The pro-consumer direction has also allowed Miti to regain its grip on certain industries. It is using its remaining powers of intervention to place market forces into the country's energy sector - including the gas and electricity utilities and the oil industry. In spite of heavy opposition from the industries, Miti is promoting the freeing of energy prices and the deregulation of distribution routes.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

Best known during the early 1980s as Britain's most highly-paid executive, Mr Giordano, 59, started work in January as the Pounds 450,000-a-year non-executive chairman of British Gas. His other non-executive directorships include Grand Metropolitan, RTZ, Lucas and Reuters, although he intends to reduce this number. BOC said his principal activities and office would remain at British Gas. BOC has appointed Mr Giordano, who had continued on its board as a non-executive, because of next month's early retirement of Mr Patrick Rich, 62, due to health problems. Mr Rich, who had intended to stay on for two more years, recently gave up the post of chief executive to Mr Alexander 'Pat' Dyer, a 61-year-old American with 30 years' experience of the international gases industry. Analysts said Mr Giordano 'knew BOC inside out', but the appointment looked stop-gap and did not answer longer-term questions about the succession. While at the helm of BOC, Mr Giordano improved productivity and expanded into the Asia-Pacific region, but also made two acquisitions which proved expensive mistakes. BOC last month reported first-quarter losses as a result of an Pounds 85m restructuring provision. The group said pressures on industrial gas profit margins would remain intense until recovery gathered strength. Healthcare profits also suffered. BOC said Mr Giordano's salary 'would entirely reflect the non-executive and part-time nature of the appointment'. Observer, Page 17   Companies:-  BOC Group.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-5637 ,"FT942-5637 _AN-EFCDVADZFT 940603   FT  03 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Siebe   The reluctance of Siebe's share price to rise with the market after yesterday's full-year results suggests investors are not yet quite convinced that it can deliver strong organic growth in the recovery. That may be a bit grudging after the relatively strong second-half progress in controls which account for three quarters of all sales. Presumably the recession in the European automotive sector which held back the specialist engineering division will not last for ever, while there must be room for fairly rapid margin improvement at the new European acquisitions. Changes in intra-company pricing may have reduced the tax charge, but they make it even harder for outsiders to analyse what is happening to margins. For example, transfer pricing changes may be one reason why margins in North America do not seem fully to reflect recovery there. The best test of Siebe's performance in the current year will thus also be one of the most basic - the extent to which overall sales are driven by organic growth. Despite the second-half improvement, last year's group turnover rose by only 2 per cent before currency changes and acquisitions. Siebe's says it is now more interested in higher market share than margin enhancement. That may say something about the nature of an economic recovery in which prices remain under pressure. Yet Siebe's operating margin which remained high during the recession is already 14.3 per cent. If that cannot be improved much in the recovery, one wonders whether it will again defy gravity when the next downturn hits.   Companies:-  Siebe.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Nonetheless, the growth surpassed recent expectations of state and private economists of zero to 0.2 per cent expansion in GDP for last year and far exceeded the initial projections a year ago that the Dutch economy would contract by as much as 1.5 per cent in 1993. The economy grew 0.8 per cent in the third quarterfrom a year earlier and expanded 0.6 per cent from the second quarter. The contraction of the economy in the fourth quarter may lay the grounds for a possible lapse into recession early this year, should the first-quarter GDP also contract.

The slow progress in economic activity resulted in a  1.2-percent reduction in the gross domestic product (GDP) for  the first time since 1987, according to a report by the  Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco). The  report revealed the manufacturing industry decreased by 1.5  percent last year, while the commerce, restaurant, and hotel  sectors declined by 1.2 percent. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in  Spanish 29 March 94 p 28)    The production of important raw materials by Pemex  Petrochemical, a subsidiary of Mexican Petroleum (Pemex), shrunk  by approximately 14 percent last year due to the closure of  obsolete plants and the difficult situation of internal and  external markets. Ethylene and polyethylene production declined  12 percent while ammonium and methanol fell 20 percent and 15  percent respectively. Pemex Petrochemical concluded that  concerning synthetic fibers, the importation of clothes, fabric,  and textiles has reduced internal production, thereby affecting  the demand for raw materials produced by Pemex.

The official said Mexico had a positive trade balance of $78.9  million. The Chilean diplomat explained bilateral trade was  boosted by the Economic Supplementary Agreement, which became  effective in January 1992. The official concluded Chile  exported $130.8-million worth of goods to Mexico during 1993,  while it imported more than $200 million worth of goods.

Among the deregulated  products are fuels like gasoline, diesel fuel, natural and  liquefied gas, and 20 primary petrochemicals. According to  Secofi, the prices of these products will be regulated by the  law of supply and demand. Secofi sources have concluded this  decision was made based on the fact the opening of the economy  guarantees availability of products for internal consumption.

The settlement between makers of silicone implants and plaintiffs claiming illnesses resulting from implant leaks should provide funds to settle litigation worldwide over the next 30 years. It also provides a partial ceiling on individual companies' liabilities. The main corporate participants in the settlement, which is still subject to fairness hearings and legal challenges, are Dow Corning (a joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning), Bristol-Myers Squibb and Baxter International. Union Carbide, the chemicals group, did not manufacture the implants but it supplied generic bulk silicone materials to the implant industry. It said its contribution to the settlement would be Dollars 138m over the next few years. The company said it had previously taken pre-tax charges totalling Dollars 35m for litigation, and the settlement would not require any charges in its first or second quarters. After probable insurance recoveries, the effect on future earnings should be negligible, it said. 3M, the diversified maker of medical products and adhesives, did make the implants but had previously held out against joining the industry-wide settlement. Subject to its directors' approval, it has now agreed to join with a contribution of Dollars 325m. The company said that, after this and other charges relating to breast implant litigation and after probable insurance recoveries, it expected to report a pre-tax charge of Dollars 35m in the first quarter, or Dollars 22m after tax.

0,FT932-1787 ,"FT932-1787 _AN-DFVCUAFDFT 930622   FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Deal that leaves all sides satisfied - Paul Abrahams assesses Rhone-Poulenc's sale of its stake in Roussel      By PAUL ABRAHAMS   THE SALE of Rhone-Poulenc's 35 per stake in Roussel Uclaf, the French bioscience group, appears to make good sense for all the companies concerned  -Rhone-Poulenc, Hoechst, the German company that owns 54.5 per cent of the bioscience group, and Roussel itself. Whether the Roussel shares are good value for investors at their present price is another matter. For Rhone-Poulenc, the deal is a relief. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman, has never made it a secret that he did not want the minority stake that was foisted on his company by the French state in July 1990. Mr Fourtou is selling the stake at the earliest possible moment under the terms of the protocols agreed between Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst in July 1990. He is also taking advantage of Roussel Uclaf's all-time high share price, up 30 per cent since the beginning of the year on expectation of high sales of the group's controversial abortion pill RU-486. Most importantly, the share sale could, at yesterday's share price of FFr575, raise FFr4.5bn (Dollars 797m) and help reduce Rhone-Poulenc's debt mountain. The group's debt is too high, fluctuating at between FFr33bn and FFr35bn, admits Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, finance director. He aims to cut debt by up to FFr7bn by the end of the year through the sale of some prefered stock in the US, the sale of assets other than Roussel, and through positive cash-flow. The deal also allows Rhone-Poulenc to dispose of a minority holding which offered it little operational control and which generated only limited synergies. Hoechst directors could scarcely hide their elation about the deal's structure, which clears a substantial minority shareholder from Roussel's board and frees the group from direct political intervention from the French government. Although the company holds a majority stake, it felt constrained by political considerations. Rhone-Poulenc is 43.4 per cent owned by the French state. Erap, the government holding company, also controls 5.5 per cent. Alternatives to the sale announced yesterday were considered, said Hoechst. However, the company said it had not been interested in a proposed deal with Rhone-Poulenc, swapping some of the German group's chemical interests for the 35 per cent stake. An outright purchase would have taken Hoechst's gearing from about 41 per cent to 52 per cent, unacceptably high given chemical companies' present poor cash-flow, said analysts. Hoechst directors said the sale could open the way for Roussel to tap the international equity markets at a later date. Members of Hoechst's board stressed the potential synergies. Hoechst is the sixth-largest drugs group in the world with sales last year of about DM11bn (Dollars 6.55bn). That compares with Roussel's pharmaceuticals sales of FFr14.8bn. There is little overlap in the companies' drugs portfolios. Hoechst estimates it will eventually be able to reduce costs at Roussel by DM250m a year. There remained considerable opportunity for rationalisation in both production and administration in the long-term, said the German company. There would also be some sharing of clinical trials, said Hoechst directors. The future of Roussel's agrochemicals business remains in doubt. Hoechst said the operation, which has a turnover of about FFr3.5bn a year, was too small to survive on its own. A decision whether to merge the business with Hoechst's agrochemicals operations had not been made. Whether the deal is good for prospective investors in Roussel remains unclear. Hoechst has tried to sweeten the pill by changing Roussel's structure. The German company intends to sell Roussel its French business, Laboratoires Hoechst, which has a turnover of about FFr1.2bn. It is also selling the French group a 50 per cent stake in Albert Roussel Pharma, a marketing operation in Germany with a turnover last year of about FFr834m. The businesses are being sold to Roussel for FFr1.2bn, according to BZW, the global co-ordinator for the internation private placement. The French company will issue about 2.2m shares at the same time as the share sale, taking the number of shares issued up to about 29m. Mr Tirouflet said the sale of Hoechst's businesses was a guarantee of Roussel's integrity and autonomy, and made the French government view the deal as more acceptable. Sales growth in the first quarter this year was only 4.2 per cent, uninspired even by recent pharmaceutical industry standards. The company is promising a 7 per cent increase in sales this year and a 15 per cent rise in net profits before exceptionals to FFr850m. Roussel is heavily involved in antibiotics, a therapeutic area hit particularly heavily by price competition in the US. Admittedly, net profits last year increased by 72 per cent to FFr1.03bn, after a round of cost-cutting. But much depends on the future success of the abortion pill RU-486. As Roussel's international road-show starts tomorrow, its executives will have some hard selling to do if they are to counter the market's current dislike of healthcare stocks.

However, the city's solid waste  discharge increased in 1993. These are facts revealed in the  ""1993 Communique on Shanghai City's Environmental Situation""  recently released by the Shanghai Municipal Environmental  Protection Bureau.    The communique says that the Shanghai GNP reached 51 billion  yuan in 1993, an increase of 14.9 percent over the 1992. Its  industrial growth was 16.8 percent in 1993.

Computer manufacturers and software suppliers complained that the Budget had done nothing to unlock capital spending by industry and commerce. Retailers, however, were pleased by moves to ease the burden of the uniform business rate. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, a large contractor and Britain's second largest housebuilder, said: 'The chancellor appears to have a higher regard for car dealers, bookmakers and film producers than he does for a construction industry suffering from the worst recession for half a century.' Mr John Gardner, managing director of ICL (UK), the UK-based computer manufacturer 80 per cent owned by Fujitsu, said: 'As the managing director of a large company it did little for me. There were no real measures to help break the capital expenditure block; nothing to encourage large companies to spend more money.' Glaxo, the UK's largest company by market capitalisation, said it would be hardly affected by the budget. Most of the company's sales were outside the UK; it therefore welcomed the prospect of changes to advance corporation tax for big overseas earners. Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN and the CBI's economic and financial policy group, described the budget as 'prudent'. He said the main reforms, the tax cut, changes to the uniform rate and the halving of the tax on cars to 5 per cent, would only cost an estimated Pounds 1.5bn compared with the CBI's call for Pounds 1.7bn of spending. 'It was a remarkably smart budget; the tax cuts were progressive rather than regressive.' Many engineering and manufacturing companies were bitter that there were no measures to stimulate investment. Industry leaders in particular were upset at Mr Lamont's failure to increase capital allowances, though there was some praise for the reduction in special car tax. Mr Mike Bright, chairman of FMT Holdings, the Brighton-based machine toolmaker, queried the rationale for write-offs of film costs over three years on a straight line basis without considering similar concessions on special projects for manufacturing industry. Sir Allen Shepherd, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, said the chancellor got the Budget 'about right both politically and economically'. He described the 5p reduction in income tax to 20p for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income as 'politically clever'. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, said the halving of car tax was helpful - the motor industry provides up to 7 per cent of chemical industry sales. Small businesses welcomed moves to prevent large customers delaying payments to their smaller suppliers and contractors, and the decision to remove most family-owned businesses from the inheritance tax net. Mr Barry Baldwin, economic adviser to the Union of Independent Companies, said: 'The greatest thing in this Budget is the encouragement to the owners of independent businesses that they can keep their companies intact.' Mr Neil Arnold, regional chief of the North Eastern Co-operative Society, said moves to restrain the impact of the uniform business rate would encourage further retail developments.

The liposome was developed as a way to extract useful  products made by cells in a new type of bioreactor being  developed in Japan called the micro-cell reactor. But it also  appears to be a promising vehicle for delivery of drugs to  target cells in the body. The work was carried out by the Agency  of Industrial Science and Technology's National Institute of  Bioscience and Human-Technology.    The liposome readily fuses with fatty membranes because it  incorporates the same protein that the influenza virus uses to  breach the cell membrane and infect cells. Cholesterol and  another compound are mixed. This viral protein is then affixed  around the periphery, producing a protein-studded liposome less  than a micron in diameter.    When these liposomes and red blood cells are mixed in a  neutral solution, nothing happens. But when the acidity is  raised a little, as many as 80 percent of the liposomes fuse  with the red blood cells. This experiment shows that it is  possible to control fusion events between the liposomes and  cells.    The micro-cell reactor differs from conventional bioreactors  in that all processes, from the introduction of raw materials  and energy, to the final stage of production when it is time to  extract useful substances, takes place inside living cells. The  process is designed to boost productivity. The national  institute developed the liposome as part of its effort to  develop an exocyte system to extract useful products from the  reactor.     "

Mr Tim Smith, the economy minister for Northern Ireland, said this week that KSA had been employed by Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board to provide 'specialist marketing and production/technical advice' on the plant, which is to receive Pounds 61m in government grants.

The report was not part of the project appraisal - it was commissioned after the UK government had approved the project, and after the European Commission had announced a formal inquiry into the proposed plant. KSA said yesterday that it had finished the report last December, a year after the UK submitted the Hualon proposal to the Commission for approval. Last month, however, KSA issued a statement in response to media inquiries about the plant, in which it forecast a 22 per cent fall in synthetic fabric production in the European Union between 1991 and 2001, and a fall of 26.4 per cent in cotton fabric production.

Brokers said the market was also weighed down by government plans to double the stock transaction tax to 0.5 per cent. The composite index ended 88.52 down at 2,861.61. Turnover came to 861.6m pesos. PLDT fell by some Dollars 5 on Wall Street last Thursday, and the market discounted its slight recovery on Friday. The local price for PLDT dropped 55 pesos to 2,035 pesos. TAIWAN shed 3.1 per cent to end at its lowest level this year in very bearish trade. Margin loan calls produced persistent selling pressure and the prices of major banks collapsed. The weighted index lost 175.63 at 5,414.64 in turnover of TDollars 52.9bn. The financial sector plunged 5.3 per cent, with the Big Three banks closing at or near the day's limit down. BANGKOK tumbled 3.3 per cent to close the day at 1,372.93, down 46.61, on nervousness ahead of local elections this weekend. BOMBAY closed slightly higher ahead of the budget announcement, which came after the close of business yesterday. However, the market moved further ahead in a 90-minute post-budget session, the BSE 30-share index firming 51.02 to 4,287.98. AUSTRALIA bounced back after successive falls to close higher, boosted by steadier overseas markets and a jump in the futures sector. The All Ordinaries index rose 31.3 to 2,180.1.

It said it would start building a factory for passenger cars in July at a yet undetermined site and begin producing vehicles at the end of 1997, making it the country's fifth car company. The statement followed a report on Tuesday by a state research institute warning that Samsung's entry into the car industry could lead to excess production capacity. Samsung Heavy Industries is holding negotiations with Nissan and Toyota on the supply of vehicle technology. Korea's big three carmakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - have also expressed opposition to Samsung's entry, claiming it would severely disrupt the Korean motor industry. The government may try to block Samsung's proposed car project by turning down its application for the import of foreign technology. Samsung is expected to file an application with the ministry of trade and industry next month. The ministry has the right to refuse a foreign technology import request if it threatens the national economy. The report by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade (KIIET), which is associated with the ministry, could be used to block Samsung. It was commissioned by the Korea Automobile Manufacturers' Association, and warned that Samsung's import of Japanese technology would damage efforts to achieve technical self-sufficiency in the motor industry. It would also lead to increased imports of Japanese car components, harming the trade balance.   Companies:-  Samsung Shipbuilding and Heavy Industries.   Countries:-  KRZ  South Korea, Asia.

According to the prereleased text  of his speech held at the opening of the two-day conference of  the bilateral economic commission in Berlin on Thursday [23  June], Rexrodt told Saudi Economics and Finance Minister Shaykh  Muhammad al-'Ali Aba-al-Khayl that he hopes to get some  information on future cooperation opportunities. The  commission, which was established in 1975, held its last meeting  in Riyadh in late February 1992. The conference will end in  Potsdam on Friday with the signing of a final protocol.    Rexrodt said he regrets that German investment in Saudi  Arabia is still very modest in volume and that it has not gone  up over the past few years. The reasons for this are not only  to be sought in Germany. Creating favorable conditions for  investment is also important for Saudi Arabia, Rexrodt said.    Rexrodt went on to express concern over the fact that German  exports to Saudi Arabia dropped by almost 15 percent in 1993,  while German imports only went down 1.1 percent. German exports  were at a high of 8.5 billion German marks [DM] in 1982. In  1993, the figure was DM3.6 billion. Imports from Saudi Arabia  amounted to some DM2 billion in 1993. The main products  imported were petroleum, fuels, and lubricating oil.    According to the Saudi Industrial Ministry, there are some  70  German-Saudi joint ventures. The German Society for Technical  Cooperation (GTZ) has arranged for over 100 experts to provide  training and consultation for Saudi institutions. Cooperation  in science and technology concentrates on the use of solar  energy for hydrogen production.     "
0,FT942-9714 ,"FT942-9714 _AN-EEPB4AAZFT 940514   FT  14 MAY 94 / Report to Miti urges delaying plutonium use      By WILLIAM DAWKINS      TOKYO   A government panel is to propose that Japan delays ambitious plans to increase its use of plutonium as a nuclear fuel. The suggestion, to be presented to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry next month for consideration as official policy, comes in response to growing domestic and international concern over a surplus of plutonium, a highly toxic fuel that can be used for nuclear weapons. An interim report, by the advisory committee for energy, calls for construction of a second plutonium powered fast-breeder reactor to be delayed from the end of this decade to early next, according to details leaked by officials. It suggests that plans for a second fuel reprocessing plant - which extracts plutonium from spent fuel - should be suspended until well beyond 2010. Japan's first prototype fast-breeder, named Monju, based on the west coast, began a self-sustaining reaction last month, using plutonium fuel produced at reprocessing plants in Britain and France. Its first reprocessing plant, at Rokkasho-mura in northern Japan is due to start operations at the end of the decade. A second Japanese reprocessing plant was due to open in 2010, but the panel says that a construction schedule should not be decided until then, implying that it could not start operating at least until 2020. A decline in prices for uranium, the fuel used in conventional nuclear power stations, has weakened the economic argument for plutonium fuelled fast breeder reactors, said an official at the government's agency of national resources and energy. However, this would only be a temporary delay in long term plans to increase Japan's use of plutonium.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.   Industries:-  P2869 Industrial Organic Chemicals, NEC.

Comments and the Final Rule      The Agency received comments from five parties, Borden Chemical and Plastics (BCP), Bethlehem Apparatus (BA), PPG Industries (PPG), Olin Chemicals (Olin), and the Chlorine Institute (CI). Their collective comments and the Agency's response follows.  The proposal limited the conditional exemption to certain mercury-bearing hazardous wastes generated by the Chlorine Institute. BCP, BA, and CI argued that the proposed change was too narrow, and that other mercury recovery units may also process combustible materials for legitimate metals recovery. Commenters thus recommended that the exemption should apply to all processors of mercury wastes. The Agency generally agrees with this position. Upon reevaluation, EPA believes there is no need to differentiate between units in the Chlorine Industry and similar units outside the Chlorine Industry. Therefore, the Agency is promulgating a rule which includes units operated by manufacturers and users of mercury or mercury products.  BCP addressed a second option for broadening the exemption so that devices other than those operated in the Chlorine Industry could process combustible wastes for legitimate metals recovery. BCP suggested EPA define mercury as a precious metal and allow processors to burn mercury laden hazardous wastes subject to the Agency's BIF precious metals exemption (see 266.100(f)). EPA does not agree with BCP's contention that mercury is a precious metal. Mercury is not considered a precious metal by EPA or other Agencies or organizations. Precious metals are defined by the Bureau of Mines to include gold, silver, platinum, and palladium (Mineral Commodity Summary, 1993), and by EPA at 40 CFR 266.70 to include gold, silver, platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhodium, and ruthenium, all metals whose value assures adequate control. Therefore, EPA rejects the approach suggested by BCP.  BCP, PPG, Olin, and CI also commented that the list of materials in the proposed technical clarification should be broadened to include the following additional items:         Sweepings  Respiratory Cartridge Filters  Cleanup Articles  Plastic Bags and Other Contaminated Containers  Laboratory and Process Control Samples  Wastewater Treatment Plant Sludge and Filter Cake  Mercury cell process sump and tank sludges  Mercury cell process solids  K106  Recoverable levels of mercury contained in soil         Upon evaluation, the Agency agrees that of these materials are appropriate for an exemption as long as they have recoverable levels of mercury. However, many mercury units, e.g., retorters, are not combustion devices and organic emissions may not be controlled in these units. Therefore, the Agency is concerned that materials with recoverable levels of mercury, but laden with hazardous organics, may not provide adequate destruction of the hazardous organics in exempt retorters, and thus, may not be protective of human health and the environment. For that reason, the Agency is promulgating a broadened list of materials but is limiting the exemption to these wastes specifically identified and that contain less than 500 ppm of part 261, appendix VIII organics.      Finally, there appears to be some confusion by the Chlorine Industry about their status under the BIF rules (collectively, those regulations set forth in 40 CFR Part 266, Subpart H). CI, PPG, and Olin argued that they are not subject to BIF because they do not ``burn'' or ``combust'' anything and the BIF rules are written for combustion devices. The Agency agrees that many mercury recovery devices do not ``burn'' or ``combust'' by design; however, these units are Industrial Furnaces as defined in   260.10 and, thus, are subject to the appropriate BIF rules. In particular, 260.10 defines Industrial Furnaces as ``devices *** that use     thermal treatment     to accomplish recovery of materials'' and that these include ``refining furnaces''. [Emphasis added.] Mercury recovery units raise the temperature of the waste to aid in the recovery and refining of mercury. Therefore, they are refining furnaces. In addition, 266.100(c) states that ``smelting, melting and refining furnaces *** that     process     hazardous waste solely for metals recovery are conditionally exempt ***.'' [Emphasis added.] This language includes all refining furnaces that     process       hazardous waste, irrespective of whether the process to achieve this end is combustion or not. Therefore, mercury recovery devices are BIFs, and come within the terms of 266.100(c). EPA is using the term ``mercury recovery furnace'' in today's amended rule to further clarify this point. (It should be noted that compliance with the BIF rules for these devices are not rigorous. It requires sending a one time written notification to the regional Director and following the provisions set forth in 266.100(c).)  Mercury recovery operators should note that the changes discussed in this section of the preamble only apply to units which have a metals recovery exemption. Units which process these wastes without the proper exemption are in violation of the BIF rules and subject to enforcement action.      D. Amendment of Rules on Use Constituting Disposal      In 1985, EPA created a separate regulatory regime for hazardous wastes that are recycled by being used in a manner constituting disposal. Part 266 subpart C. 1  These rules provide, in essence, that the wastes can be so used without being subject to the RCRA facility standards if the waste-derived product (i.e. the hazardous wastes that is being used by being applied to the land (i.e. used in a manner constituting disposal)) has been ``produced for the general public's use,'' has undergone a chemical change so as to be inseparable by physical means, and if it meets the applicable LDR treatment standard. See 266.20(b).        1     These rules apply, of course, only if the recycling is legitimate, and not a form of surrogate disposal. 266.20(a) applies only to ``recyclable materials'', which are hazardous wastes being recycled. 261.6(a)(1).

Gross domestic product expanded to Dollars 255.33bn, making Argentina the region's wealthiest country, with income per head of Dollars 7,800 (Pounds 5,340), according to figures this week. However, private economists expect growth to decelerate to about 3.5-4 per cent this year, thanks mainly to a reduction in the foreign capital inflows that have driven the economy ahead since 1991. Capital inflows are expected to fall to Dollars 10bn from Dollars 17.61bn last year. Argentina's low investment rate is alarming private economists. Although investment rose by one-eighth over the previous year, at 18.4 per cent of GDP it is still low by international standards. Investment at the height of Argentina's hyperinflation crisis in 1989-90 averaged 15 per cent of GDP. A European banker commented: 'Investors and businessmen have been burnt so often in the past that they are unwilling to take risks now.' Growth came mainly from privatised utilities, the construction industry and the financial sector. Manufacturing industry rose 4.5 per cent, while agriculture - which produces two-thirds of Argentina's exports - fell 1 per cent. Concern continues to grow over Argentina's poor savings rate and its heavy reliance on foreign capital. Last year's savings rate edged up to 16 per cent of GDP; consumption rose by one-fifth, to 83.5 per cent. Argentina's trade deficit is also deteriorating rapidly. The 1993 deficit of Dollars 3.7bn is expected to rise by one-third this year to Dollars 5bn.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

The latest such  ""miracle"" was the ""Free Economic Zone."" Everyone knows what  became of that. Recently, belief in a new ""miracle"" has emerged,  this time the financial-industrial groups (FPG  [finansovo-promyshlennyye gruppy]), based on a regional  financial-industrial group called the Kuznetsk Company.  Supposedly we can pull ourselves out of this crisis by our own  bootstraps, right here at home.    In a recent address to his fellow citizens M. Kislyuk,  governor of the Kuzbass and also administration chief of mining  towns and head of a number of coal-producing enterprises in the  oblast, stated that ""information received from Moscow indicates  an unwillingness and inability to establish order, not in basic  industries such as the coal industry, much less in the entire  country."" That statement preceded a rather curious conclusion:  since B. I. Yeltsin and V. S. Chernomyrdin are not capable of  establishing proper order in the country, we are going to help  see to it that they are replaced and wait for ""our own people""  from Russia's Choice to take office. Is that really the issue?    Is it up to the drowning to save themselves? Can we break  this crisis right here where we live and create an economic  oasis? Laudable! But is it possible at this point in the game?  Can the planned Kuznetsk Company actually function effectively?  I assert that it cannot. Why am I so certain? Because such a  decision is not economically justified or well reasoned. It is  proposed that this faulty concept be used to create a new  hybrid, something like Sovrynkhoz -- a market-oriented sovkhoz.  Judge for yourself. The Kuznetsk Company FPG is supposed to  combine in a single entity 278 major industrial enterprises in  the coal, metals and energy industries and rail transportation.  Or, to put it another way, 30.7 percent of all large enterprises  in our oblast. But that is not all. There are plans to lock up  R18 billion [rubles] in fixed capital in the Kuznetsk Company  FPG at 1984 prices, which is equivalent to 73 percent of all  fixed production capital in the oblast economy. Would that not  constitute a supermonopoly?    If such a decision were actually approved even for a short  period of time, then we would definitively lump all of our  problems together and witness a repetition of the failed company  that was supposed to create a free economic zone. Once again the  mountain would produce a mouse.    Addressing an expanded session of the Russian Federation  government, B. Yeltsin said that the creation of an FPG ""is a  means of concentrating resources in growth areas and supporting  investment activity and competitiveness. The government must  find the proper course in order not to slow down or hamper this  process, but rather to monitor it and head off adverse effects.""  To what was the President referring when he mentioned ""adverse  effects""? Possible the very ""ideas"" that are leading to  establishment of a ""Sovrynkhoz"" and others like them. It seems  to me that the Kuzbass administration, in order to avoid falling  into another quagmire, should carefully study both our own  Russian experience with the establishment of corporations  (FPGs), i.e., KamAZ, ZIL, NGMK, Lukoyl, etc., as well as the  tremendous amount of time-tested experience accumulated in the  United States, England, Germany and Japan.    A question naturally presents itself: on what financial  basis  are they attempting to establish the Kuznetsk Company FPG?  According to a statement by A. Lavrov, chairman of the oblast  Committee for State Property Management, it will include not  only gigantic regional complexes in specific industries -- coal,  metals, energy and rail transportation -- but also the committee  itself, the Kuzbassinvestugol Corporation, etc.    As for the committee, it is obvious that this is an effort  to  save it from collapsing altogether. But why at the expense of  coal and steel producers? That is not just a financial question,  it is a moral one. An artificial hybrid will not produce  positive results. On the one hand, it sharply restricts  organizational and scientific-technical maneuvering room, and on  the other it restricts and thoroughly obstructs the field  available for economic maneuvering. As a poet once said, a horse  and a skittish deer cannot be harnessed to the same cart.    Our preliminary analysis indicates that for the sake of the  oblast economy it would be appropriate to establish in the  Kuzbass, first of all, three major corporations (FPGs): Ugol  Kuzbassa [Kuzbass Coal], Metall Kuzbassa and Sibkhimiya  [Siberian Chemical]. As for rail transportation and electric  power production, they, as key elements in the federal  manufacturing infrastructure, should be independent components  of the economic process.    Now a few comments regarding the actual composition of the  proposed FPGs. This should be dictated solely by economic  expediency. For example, the Ugol Kuzbassa FPG should be  comprised of coal mining and processing enterprises, specialized  machine building plants which manufacture mining equipment,  internal production-related infrastructure, a mine rescue unit,  research and design organizations, investment companies along  the lines of Kuzbassinvestugol, and so on.    Even by world standards this would be a very large  corporation. Judge for yourself: it would have fixed capital of  R12 billion in 1984 prices. Currently more than 241,000 people  are employed in coal mining alone, with more than 400,000  working in the coal industry as a whole.    In my opinion, what we need here is not an artificial  patchwork of an FPG, but instead an integrated economic fabric  and an integral connection between everyone that becomes part of  the corporation. Particular emphasis should be placed on  creating systems of specialized trading companies in coal sale  centers.    In our opinion, all the enterprises and organizations that  comprise an FPG should be financially independent. They would be  required to operate within the framework of a single economic,  scientific-technical and investment policy and strategy, but  that would be the extent of it.    The coal industry is, I repeat, subsidized. One should not  expect any substantial foreign or private investment in the near  future. Consequently, we will have to carry out this  restructuring using federal budget funds only. Therefore I feel  that it would be very appropriate to develop a special program  for coal industry restructuring in the 1995-2010 period, with a  breakdown of investment by year.    The planned Metall Kuzbassa corporation would include, in  addition to anything else, 35 of the largest enterprises in the  ferrous and non-ferrous metals industries, with R5.8 billion in  fixed capital at 1984 prices. This would be a huge system, and  it should be set up according to the same principle as the Ugol  Kuzbassa FPG. However, if possible it should also consider  broader cooperation within Siberia and Russia and be oriented  toward multinational corporations.    Corporations are, on the one hand, the most highly developed  form of enterprise and production organization, and there are  things that can be learned from them. On the other hand, being  part of one makes it possible to attract needed investment  funds, technology and access to the world metals market so that  we can sell our products at normal world prices, not at  discounted or unprofitable prices. Under the right conditions  such a corporation could within five to seven years develop  successfully on the basis of self-financing, loans and private  investment.    Particular attention should be paid to the formation of a  corporation (FPG) to unite enterprises in the chemical industry.  Creating one within the Kuzbass exclusively would be to create  nothing.    The problem is that the Azot AO [Joint-Stock Company], the  Khimvolokno AO and other enterprises in the Kuzbass chemical  industry are economically and technologically very closely  linked to oil producing and refining enterprises in Western  Siberia and with tire plants in the Altay region and Eastern  Siberia. Therefore this corporation should be created first on  an interregional and then on a multinational basis, because the  chemical industry, like the oil industry, is economically  efficient and could under certain conditions compete in world  markets.    There is not a single reasonable person who doubts or would  dispute that it is essential to create corporations in the  economy of Russia in general and that of the Kuzbass in  particular. To a certain extent we have already attempted to  take that route, as the establishment of production associations  in the USSR was an attempt to utilize a form of incorporation,  but without its principal aspect, i.e. a market orientation.    In order to make up for lost time we must, as A. Sakharov  said, ""travel their path,"" i.e., follow a trail that has already  been blazed abroad. Since we now lag behind, we must catch up.  And we may yet surpass them.     "

This figure has  been reported in the Latvian media for the first time.    Judging from officials' reports, the debt has built up  steadily. Having turned into a chronic defaulter, the ""Latviyas  Gaze"" (""Latvian Gas"") state enterprise is also committed to pay  considerable sums in fines to its Russian suppliers. Last year  the money owing to Russia for its natural gas supplies was paid  off with the help of international loans. Since then the  situation has not changed for the better.    The leaders of ""Latviyas Gaze"" reported that this year an  agreement with Russia on gas deliveries had been concluded on  ""terms advantageous to the Latvian side."" Nonetheless, it has  not proved possible to pay the sum required. It is as if Latvia  is receiving gas on credit. The DIENA newspaper has reported  that Russia issued an official warning in mid-January to the  ""Latviyas Gaze"" state enterprise, demanding that it change its  payment policy for the gas it has used. It is proposed that  this demand be met by 1 February, otherwise gas supplies will be  cut by 50 percent.    But Latvian consumers are not threatened with any particular  unpleasantness as a result of this reduction in the supply of  Russian natural gas. The fact is that Europe's largest  underground gas storage facility, into which Russian gas has  constantly been pumped, is located in the republic at Incukalns.    Russia has agreed to forgive the debts in return for part of  the Incukalns gas storage facility and the network of gas  pipelines running across Latvian territory.     "

The share transfer will be paid for by a SR90m transfer from reserves. The transfer will keep SIB's shareholding structure. The bank is more than 40 per cent owned by Saudi private shareholders, with the remainder being held by local and international banks, including Chase Manhattan (which has 15 per cent), Industrial Bank of Japan and J. Henry Schroder Wagg. The bank said the planned capital increase, which is to be put to a shareholders' meeting in Riyadh on July 11, would 'give some psychological feeling to our customers and correspondents' and 'bring our capital closer to that of our peers', but not alter the bank's strategy. 'We are going to continue on our strategy to be a quality corporate bank for the kingdom, catering for sophisticated business clients,' it added. SIB, which has only 10 branches in the kingdom, has always seen itself as a 'boutique' corporate lender, with a strong emphasis also on private banking as a leading broker in Saudi Arabia's stock market. Banks monopolise direct brokerage in the kingdom's Dollars 50bn-capitalised stock market, which is closed to foreign investors. SIB's recapitalisation will not affect its position as one of the kingdom's smallest banks. It is among the last of the kingdom's 11 listed commercial banks to recapitalise over the past few years, during which most banks have taken advantage of the post Gulf war stock market boom to issue new stock.

This is the highest critical  temperature (temperature at which superconductive state is  shown) achieved for a substance that does not use elements with  high toxicity such as mercury or thallium.    The synthesized substance is composed of silver, barium,  calcium, copper and oxygen in the ratio of 1:2:3:4:10.  Superconducting state was confirmed by full diamagnetism and  full conductivity. In addition to high critical temperature,  preliminary test results indicate that critical current density,  which shows size of current flow, will be high, 1 million  amperes per square centimeter.    Director Hideo Ihara of the superconductive materials  laboratory packed a gold capsule with silver and other materials  and synthesized a 4 millimeter square mass at high pressure  (50,000 atmospheres) and high temperature (1,100ëC). The  most popular method of fabricating superconducting material is  to deposit molecular layers one by one, but weaknesses of this  method include the fact that metal decomposes easily and the  fact that oxygen tends to escape from the crystal structure.    Hereafter, study to reveal crystal structure with great  precision will be advanced. Also, since the space between layers  of copper oxide, which demonstrate superconductivity, can be  reduced if silver is used, it is possible that material with  even better performance can be developed.    Until now, the best critical temperature recorded for  low-toxicity superconducting substances was absolute temperature  110ë (-163ëC) for a substance using bismuth.     "

Saint-Gobain said the move would reflect a long-standing relationship between the two companies. BNP holds just under 4 per cent of Saint-Gobain's shares. Mr Marc de Nadaillac, managing director, also said he saw no signs of recovery in the group's principal markets in the current half. He was speaking the day after the group announced a two-thirds fall in net profits for the first half of the year, to FFr452m (Dollars 80.7m) from FFr1.4bn. In particular, the sale of glass to the automotive industry, Saint-Gobain's largest business activity, is expected to remain depressed as a result of the continued sharp decline in the European car market. Mr de Nadaillac said the company would expand outside Europe and develop specialty products to counteract the effects of the recession in its principal markets. Mexico, Korea and eastern Europe were being considered. The company also plans to trim its debt and investments in the second half of the year. Gearing is forecast to fall to 45 per cent at the end of the year, compared with 46 per cent at the end of 1992. Industrial investments are targetted at FFr4.6bn this year compared with FFr5.08bn in 1992.

Rap, which distributes industrial products such as hoses, gloves, gaskets and uniforms, is hoping to raise about Pounds 4.6m in an institutional placing. About Pounds 2.1m of the net proceeds will be used to redeem preference shares and the balance will provide working capital to fund expansion largely through acquisition.

He is joined on the board by Mr Lionel Stammers, former joint head of BTR's European division, who is a non-executive director. Since the buy-out, Rap has increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 496,000 in 1991 to Pounds 1.22m in 1993. Sales have risen in the same period from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 19.3m. However, the sharp rise in profits and sales was helped in part by acquisitions in 1993. In its pathfinder prospectus published yesterday, the group forecast pre-tax profits for 1994 of not less than Pounds 1.7m. The company said sales had increased largely because of greater activity in its market sectors. Margins had improved through operating efficiencies.

In the SAT-1 program ""Let's Get  Down to Business, Chancellor,"" Kohl said on Wednesday [22 June]  that he does not at all share the opinion of Hans Peter Stihl,  president of the German Industrial and Trade Association (DIHT),  who had advocated drastic social cuts, among other things.  Klaus Murmann, president of the Federation of Employers'  Associations, had taken up this demand and suggested cuts in the  social benefits for welfare recipients who are able to work.    In the television program, however, Kohl advocated that  abuse  and the ""propagation"" of social benefits ""according to the pork  barrel principle"" be eliminated. Social benefits are reserved  for those who are really poor, Kohl said. His proposal to  introduce more part-time work must not be misunderstood as a  panacea for the elimination of unemployment. The chancellor  advocated that apprentices immediately get a part-time job after  they have concluded their training if it is not possible to  immediately employ them permanently.    Kohl promised to reconsider the 20-percent investment  allowance for enterprises owned by former GDR citizens. It is  conceivable for him that this allowance will not be completely  abolished, but it might be degressively shaped.    The chancellor explicitly paid tribute to the attitude of  the  employers and trade unions when the latest collective  negotiations were concluded. ""In the past few weeks, we  received very wise and reasonable collective agreements,"" he  said. After an economic decline, there is ""a tendency"" toward  an upswing. Moreover, he expects an increase in the gross  national product that exceeds the forecast of 1.5 percent.     "

During the fourth quarter, operating profits at BOC's core gases operations rose an underlying 13 per cent, a modest increase compared with the rest of the chemicals sector. That helps to explain the company's 15 per cent underperformance against the sector over the past two years. But the qualities of gas companies start to shine near the peak as cyclical companies' earnings growth decelerates. BOC's steady progress should be sustained long after that despite continuing price pressures. BOC has been aggressively cutting costs and busy improving its product mix. But most of the earnings growth will be driven by strong volumes. The industrial gas market expands almost twice as fast as GDP and BOC is heavily exposed to the fast-expanding Asian economies. The stock is at a price earnings premium to the market for 1995 of about 20 per cent. In the near-term BOC has little chance of outperforming. But its resilience will look increasingly attractive by 1996 when the market's earnings growth is expected to slow to about 5 per cent. BOC's biggest headache remains its pharmaceuticals business which is small, risky and provides no compelling synergy with the rest of the group. There is no urgency to dispose of the operation because its new anaesthetic drug should compensate for the decline in its old product. The long-term danger is that like Boots and Fisons it will find little significant in the research and development pipeline. If the right price is offered, BOC would do well to exit.

Although the company had announced a restructuring of its chemical operations as far back as December 1991, and a spin-off was widely expected, the announcement came earlier than anticipated. Cyanamid has steadily distanced itself from its chemical operations over the past two years. It has already sold eight chemicals businesses and last year its remaining chemical operations were set up as a separate unit, with its own headquarters, under the Cytec Industries name. Cyanamid's chemicals business had 1992 operating earnings of Dollars 34m, up 6 per cent from 1991, while sales slid 8 per cent to Dollars 1.05bn. In contrast, the company's medical group saw sales rise 10 per cent in the year to Dollars 2.89bn although operating earnings rose a more moderate 3 per cent to Dollars 395m. The decision to move away from chemicals to concentrate on higher-margin drugs and life sciences operations was widely applauded in 1991, at a time when many pharmaceuticals companies saw earnings growth in the 20 per cent range. In recent months, however, Cyanamid's stock price has fallen, along with other pharmaceutical company issues, amid concern that the Clinton administration's criticism of high drug prices will translate into slower earnings growth. On Wall Street, shares in Cyanamid rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 1/4 yesterday. The stock was unavailable for late trading, following the spin-off announcement.

The company said its results reflected the domestic economic recovery as well as an improvement in its chemical division, an increased contribution from its gas division and better productivity. It added that the improvement in margins accelerated in the third quarter. It said the strong performance in the chemical and gas units compensated for the downturn in the oil business. Income from chemicals was up from Pta3.7bn to Pta10.7bn and by 23.1 per cent to Pta33bn in the gas division. Profits in Repsol refining and oil marketing division, however, fell by 3 per cent to Pta72bn and dropped by 29 per cent to Pta11.7bn in the exploration and production division. Repsol lifted its gas profile earlier this year when Gas Natural, the dominant domestic gas distributor which is 45 per cent owned by Repsol, acquired Enagas, the big state-owned importer of natural gas. Gas Natural has, as result, become the third biggest gas company in Europe and the virtual monopoly gas importer and distributor in the fast growing domestic market.

Operating profit, however, fell to R34.07m from R35.9m despite a 6 per cent increase in turnover to R737.4m, reflecting the difficult market conditions. The interim dividend was maintained at 20 cents a share on a 21 per cent increase in earnings per share to 42.5 cents, from 35.1 cents. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said an end to inventory corrections by steel stockists and new projects had helped local steel sales increase by nearly 10 per cent over the same period in 1992. Although world steel consumption is forecast to fall this year, prices continue to improve, and all of Highveld's ironmaking furnaces were brought back into production. Mr Boyd predicted that firmer dollar prices for export steel and ferro-alloy products, and a weaker rand, should allow a 'moderate' increase in second-half earnings over the first six months. The vanadium market, however, continues to be difficult. Prices have fallen to a level last seen during the recessionary period of 1982-83. This is the result of lower consumption, exacerbated by the entry of Russian producers at costs 'unrelated to western costs'. Highveld, the world's largest vanadium producer, has closed its Vantra vanadium pentoxide plant. It is unlikely to open again before the fourth quarter. The Rand Carbide and Transalloys divisions continued to operate below capacity, though the outlook is now more positive, while sales at the Rheem division were lower than in 1992.

At the close, BP shares were 7 1/2 down at 303 1/2 p on very healthy turnover of some 11m. The view that the shares had been overbought during the recent upsurge was echoed by Mr John Toalster, oil analyst at Strauss Turnbull and one of the market's biggest bears of BP shares during the past couple of years. 'On a yield basis the shares are massively overvalued; at the very least they are a sell down to 250p and there is every justification to sell them down to 200p,' he said. US investors have been the biggest supporters of BP in recent months, although Mr Toalster said the rate of increase in the US shareholding in BP is slowing down. US investors are thought to speak for some 25 per cent of BP, up from the 23 per cent level at the end of 1992 and the 24 per cent reached in mid-February. Lasmo attracted a fresh wave of heavy selling pressure, which drove the shares down 6 1/2 to 155 1/2 p. Dealers pointed to the substantial level of activity in the stock - turnover was a hefty 5.1m - and said the recent series of institutional visits undertaken by the Lasmo board following the disastrous figures and dividend cut had been badly received. British Gas touched a record 319p early in the session, but later came off to close only 2 up at 316 1/2 p as the market began to take the view that the shares are now fairly valued ahead of the outcome of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, expected in around a month's time. A report from Halifax Building Services, that house sales in February were higher than at any time during the previous two years, plus the recent sharp slowing in the rate of company insolvencies, prompted another strong performance from bank shares. Abbey National was a big beneficiary of the house sales story, the stock advancing 4 1/2 to 384 1/2 p in heavy turnover of 5.7m shares. Lloyds, still well supported on the market view that the bank is well positioned to increase its dividend at a more rapid rate than its rivals, climbed 9 more to 544p. Nervous selling ahead of the April 8 figures saw Sun Alliance drift off 6 to 343p, although most of the insurance stocks tended to lose ground. Holiday group Airtours fell 6 to 299p as the impact of its failed bid for Owners Abroad was felt. Airtours sold its stake in its rival at a loss of more than Pounds 3m on Tuesday. Owners was steady at 124p. Rothmans International saw its 'B' shares jump 38 to 678p after the tobacco group announced reorganisation details for its Asian tobacco businesses. ICI held up against a forecast downgrade from one of its brokers, Hoare Govett. The house chemicals analyst was unavailable but rival analysts said Hoare cut by around Pounds 100m to Pounds 630m for this year and by Pounds 150m to Pounds 800m for next year. ICI shares were 8 higher with the market at 1177p. The news that international trading group Lonrho had sold its German property interests helped the shares firm 2 to 82p. US buyers were said to have favoured Danka Business and the shares jumped 53 to 645p. UK flag carrier British Airways put on 4 1/2 at 291p after stating that it was bringing forward the payment of its final dividend, to take account of the recent changes in UK advance corporation tax that were announced in last month's Budget. Renewed caution on Eurotunnel's dispute with Channel tunnel constructor TML saw the shares surrender 11 to 462p. Advertising group WPP was firm ahead of tomorrow's call on the Pounds 88m rights issue. The ordinary stock gained a penny at 56p while the nil-paid moved ahead 2 to 11 1/2 p. Textile group William Baird fell 22 to 266p in reaction to the announcement of 1992 profits. The headline figure of Pounds 23.4m was in line with forecasts but there was disappointment that the company did not use the new accounting standards. Women's wear group House of Lerose leapt 40 to 186p after an agreed Pounds 10.8m bid by clothing retailer Country Casuals, which eased 2 to 167p. Shares in construction equipment company BM Group gave up 5 to 31p after the company confirmed a fall in profits and a cut in the dividend as it reported interim figures.

Those inclined to fret about consumer confidence may focus on the drop in production of footwear and clothing. Those who believe in robust growth can point to distortions from the rail strike and the explosion at the Milford haven oil refinery. But together with recent data on housing, CBI survey evidence and short-time working at Ford, the output data do suggest some slowdown in the pace of growth. Worries about higher base rates seem to be abating: indeed the money markets are shading down their expectations in this regard. The authorities' thinking may become clearer on Monday when minutes are published of the meeting at which September's base rate rise was decided. The aim appears to be the laudable one of preventing the output gap closing too quickly, which would unleash inflation, while still preserving the recovery. In that case, a modest deceleration of growth now would be welcome in helping the chancellor achieve the required balance. Amid all the bond market turbulence it is easy to lose sight of the way in which investors have given the authorities credit for the base rate rise. Equities have fallen 155 points since then, and the long bond yield is unchanged at just over 8.6 per cent. But the yield premium of gilts over US and German government stock has narrowed by 30 and 15 basis points respectively. That shows some faith in the value of Mr Clarke's pre-emptive strike.

Their proposal follows calls for a radical reform of sixth form studies from organisations including the Labour party, the Confederation of British Industry and the Industrial Society. However, the government refers to A-levels as an 'academic gold standard', and reform was ruled out last year by Mr John Patten, then education secretary. The Headmasters' Conference, which represents the heads of the most prestigious independent mixed and boys' schools, meeting in Bournemouth, said: 'We believe the terms academic and vocational as they are currently used are misleading and damaging.' A working party of headteachers, including representatives of several schools which regularly reach the top of government national rankings of A-level results, described the exams as 'educationally wasteful'. It said 30 per cent of 18-year-olds were now attempting academic A-levels, although they were designed to be taken by a significantly narrower proportion of the age group. More than a quarter of those attempting them abandoned them or failed. Instead, the heads recommended there should be a 'structured progression' from a broad national curriculum to 'something more differentiated', which took account of differing aptitudes. This system would give equal esteem to vocational courses by subsuming all current qualifications under a general 'advanced certificate of secondary education'. One central authority would oversee the qualifications. Responsibility is split at the moment between the education and employment departments.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT933-12392 ,"FT933-12392 _AN-DGYABABGFT 930724   FT  24 JUL 93 / Cartography of distress redrawn: FT regional writers on results of bids for assisted area status   GRINS of relief and groans of disappointment swept through town halls and local economic development offices yesterday when Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, announced the new assisted areas map. The winners of assistance - those areas which the government says have the worst unemployment problems - could now see companies in their areas applying for subsidy under the Industrial Development Act 1982. The losers - the Department of Trade and Industry received 2,000 submissions - will have to find help from other government programmes. The acknowledgement of employment difficulties in London and the south and the removal of parts of Wales from the map has given a fresh twist to the cartography of distress. Yet the shape of the map has a weary familiarity, two generations after the first attempts to reduce regional economic imbalances. The first four areas designated by the 1934 Special Areas Act were west-central Scotland, west Cumberland, north-east England and south Wales. Many of these areas are still economically disadvantaged. The growth of European Community spending through its structural funds has meant that regional funding from Whitehall is relatively less important now than in the 1930s or 1970s. Earlier this week EC ministers agreed on a regional funds package which would mean Pounds 2bn in assistance for the UK between 1994 and 1999. Mr Sainsbury yesterday sought to separate domestic and EC policy. 'I would emphasise that there is no direct connection between the assisted areas map and the structural funds maps,' he said. Local authorities do see a link. Mr Mark Hume, assistant director of economic planning at Kent County Council, said: 'The DTI might say there is no formal connection between regional assistance and European structural funds, but you would have little chance of getting any money from Europe if your own country does not support you.' Mr Paul Bevan, economic development officer at Brighton District Council, says: 'We regarded regional selective assistance as a necessary first step to gaining help from Europe. Now we've been turned down our chances must be very low.' The criteria for the 1994-99 structural funds map have not yet been drawn up, but in the past EC criteria have been more widely cast than those of the DTI. The former have been concerned with broad issues such as rural regeneration, the latter largely with employment. The EC has used varied statistical material in making its assessments of aid-worthy areas, including local gross domestic product figures. The DTI's basic tool is unemployment figures. There is a wide degree of overlap in the areas chosen for the two maps, but exclusion from assisted areas status does not always mean an automatic bar to the EC map. Birmingham City Council pointed out a disparity in aid. Since 1984, when the area was given intermediate status on the assisted areas map, it has received Pounds 200m - Pounds 145m from the EC and Pounds 56m from UK sources. The disparity is not surprising since EC spending is frequently on costly public infrastructure projects. UK regional spending, by contrast, is demand-led by companies. UK regional policy over the past 10 years has moved towards regenerating areas of urban decline, so that regional spending under the Industrial Development Act has become just another instrument alongside others such as urban development corporations and enterprise zones. Combined with constraints on government spending, a slowdown in inward investment and corporate reluctance to expand during recession, UK regional spending has been kept at modest levels. Expenditure on regional selective assistance, the most important subsidy, in England was Pounds 74m in fiscal 1991-92, an estimated Pounds 72m in 1992-93 and is expected to be about Pounds 89m in 1993-94. The more modest UK spending is, the greater the interest in EC funding.  ----------------------------------------        WINNERS: NEW ASSISTED AREAS  ---------------------------------------- Alfreton and Ashfield Alnwich and Amble Barstaple and Ilfracombe Barrow-in-Furness Bideford Bridlington and Driffield Castleford and Pontefract Chesterfield Clacton Dorchester and Weymouth (Weymouth and Portland part) Dover and Deal Folkestone Great Yarmouth Harwich Hastings Heathrow (Park Royal part) Isle of Wight London (Lea Valley, Park Royal, London end of east Thames corridor) Louth and Mablethorpe Mansfield Retford Sittingbourne and Sheerness Skegness St. Austell Thanet Thurso Torbay Wakefield and Dewsbury Whitehaven Wisbech Worksop  ----------------------------------------     LOSERS: NO LONGER ASSISTED AREAS  ---------------------------------------- Accrington and Rossendale Badenoch Bradford Cardiff Corby Cynderford and Ross-on-Wye Darlington Kidderminster Lampeter and Aberaeron Manchester Newport (eastern part) Scunthorpe Shotton, Flint and Rhyl (part) Stewartry Telford and Bridgnorth Wrexham (part)  ---------------------------------------- Source: DTI  ----------------------------------------   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry forecast output for the first quarter of the next business year, at 22.4m tonnes, the lowest since 1971. The figure is down 14.7 per cent from the previous year and down 0.1 per cent from the preceding quarter. The gloomy estimates follow the recent spate of strong economic data which many private economists believe indicates the country's economy has hit bottom. 'All the good stories are overdone,' Mr Richard Werner, chief economist at brokers Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo, said. He predicted economic figures to be announced during May and June were likely to reflect a still sluggish economy. The ministry said crude steel production for the year ending March 31 would fall below 100m tonnes for the second consecutive year to an estimated 97m tonnes, down 1.9 per cent from the previous year. However, analysts expecting a recovery this year led by consumer spending were comforted by household spending figures for January announced yesterday. These indicated a year-on-year rise for the fourth consecutive month. According to the Management and Co-ordination Agency, household spending in January increased 2.7 per cent in real terms from a year earlier. Spending by salaried workers grew a net 0.6 per cent for the first time in nine months, while spending by households of the self-employed surged 6 per cent. Expenditure on education rose 16.9 per cent and housing spending rose 14.2 per cent; medical-care spending fell 3 per cent.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

In a document published yesterday on meeting obligations under treaties to protect the atmosphere, the government says it is committed to reducing emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. HFCs are used in refrigerators and air-conditioning units to replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which damage the ozone layer. But HFCs are themselves greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming and, because they are new products, UK emissions in 1990 were negli-gible. ICI insisted yesterday that HFCs did not damage the environment any more than other products. Mr John Beckitt, ICI's business manager for the product, which is sold under the name Klea, said: 'In many applications they reduce energy consumption and therefore carbon dioxide emissions.' It has three plants - one in Runcorn, Cheshire, one in Louisiana in the US and half of a joint venture in Japan. Total investment is Pounds 135m, of which Pounds 30m is in the UK. The document acknowledges that the UK will have difficulties meeting the emission target by 2000. It says the government 'will therefore be exploring further with HFC producers and consumers how best to make progress in relation to the UK commitment'. It says it will be 'exploring the scope for voluntary agreements to ensure that (HFC) emissions are minimised and not used where unavoidable if safe, practical and more environmentally acceptable alternatives are available.'

The company's process engineering subsidiary yesterday  signed  an exclusive memorandum of understanding with Chinese Offshore  Industrial Corporation [COIC], a state-owned shipbuilding group.  The two companies are finalising joint-venture terms.    The agreement covers construction of on-shore petro-chemical  plants as well as off-shore oil and gas production facilities  for use in China.    The deal will also enable the joint venture to build  advanced  deep-water floating production vessels in China for sale  worldwide.    Amec will contribute half the venture's costs. In return for  enhancing its strategic position in the Chinese market, Amec  will transfer technology for management of projects and  engineering design.    Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said: ""Although technology  transfer was an issue, it was clear than many key skills and  abilities already exist in our partner's organisation.""    The venture will develop a joint facility at Huang Pu  shipyard in Guangzhou province in southern China, capable of  building modules of up to 5,000 tonnes each. COIC also has the  ability to build large floating production platforms at a  300,000-tonne dry dock in north-east China.    Amec is already building accommodation modules in  partnerships with COIC for Phillips Petroleum platforms in the  South China Sea.

The sale generated a capital gain of Dollars 94m for Electrolux, but write-offs of goodwill of SKr820m (Dollars 104m) mean that it will take a net charge of SKr80m for the sale in its 1994 accounts. 'The divestment of Blaw Knox will strengthen the group's financial position and is in line with our strategy of streamlining the group's operations and concentrating resources in our core areas,' said Mr Leif Johansson, the chief executive.

The shipowner said the results were not directly comparable, as Bona Shipping, a unit in which the shipowner holds a 42 per cent stake, is no longer consolidated into accounts while Cool Carriers, in which it holds a 37.5 per cent stake, is. Hoegh suffered weaker markets in several of its shipping segments, reduced its car carrier fleet and experienced routine drydocking of liner vessels.

The report suggests that many closed shops are 'sleeping dogs'. They avoid legal problems because nobody gets sacked for not belonging to a union, but in other ways operate much as they did in the past. A poll commissioned by the Department of Employment in 1989 found that 2.6m people thought they were still in closed shops. That represented a fall of 50 per cent since the high point of the closed shop at the end of the 1970s. But, as the report points out, 2.6m is a high figure for an institution that is meant to be unlawful. They suggest that the 'real closed shop population' - closed shop agreements that continue to exist in spite of it being illegal to sack someone for leaving the union - may be 500,000. The report concludes that the managerial indifference which marked the rise of the closed shop in the late 1970s seems also to have attended its demise in the 1980s.

0,FT941-13685 ,"FT941-13685 _AN-EAYDAAAQFT 940125   FT  25 JAN 94 / Diplomatic woes complicate Macedonia's reform efforts: The many obstacles to viable statehood      By KERIN HOPE   Mr Savo Stankovic, Macedonia's leading exporter of printed circuit boards, points to the factory he is having built outside Skopje, the capital: 'If things were different, that plant would be on an industrial estate in Greece.' Until two years ago Computronica, Mr Stankovic's company, received most of its orders from Greek electronics suppliers. But after Greece refused to recognise the former Yugoslav republic, on the grounds that its name amounted to a territorial claim on the northern Greek province of Macedonia, his Greek customers 'telephoned to say they were under official pressure to stop doing business with Skopje'. 'Business was growing so fast I'd planned to apply for incentives offered under the Greek foreign investment law, for manufacturing high-tech products there. Instead, I was questioned by the Greek police during a business trip and then refused a visa.' Because bank loans were not available while Macedonia was struggling for international recognition, Mr Stankovic had to invest his own capital, together with funds provided by German customers, to build the Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.4m) plant at home. He says he already has orders, worth Dollars 650,000 a month, from Germany and Turkey. Mr Stankovic's experience underlines how Balkan politics have exacerbated the problems facing Macedonian businesses since the republic broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991. Just as Macedonia was starting the transition to a market economy, UN sanctions were imposed against Serbia, its main trading partner. Although Macedonia is now a UN member developing ties with several European Union member states, Greece continues to harass its neighbour, refusing entry to Macedonian passport-holders and delaying shipments of oil and other Skopje-bound goods that come through the northern port of Thessaloniki, Macedonia's closest outlet to the sea. Greece objects not just to Macedonia's name, but to its flag, which carries a sunburst symbol associated with the northern Greek dynasty of Alexander the Great, and its constitution, thought by the Greeks to endorse an expansionist vision of uniting with Greek Macedonia. The underlying fear is that Greece's Slav-speaking minority, never fully assimilated and with strong ties to Macedonia, could one day adopt a political platform calling for self-determination. Hopes that Greece's current responsibility as EU president for promoting a common foreign policy would stimulate a change in attitude were dashed at the outset, when Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou refused to rule out closing the border with Macedonia. However, last night Mr Papandreou said Greece was ready to hold talks with Macedonia under United Nations auspices if it offered 'practical examples' of being prepared to reach a compromise. Mr Papandreou, opening a debate on the Macedonia issue, sounded more moderate than in the past, making clear that Greece wanted Macedonia to survive as an independent state. The Greek government was willing to contribute to Macedonia's development, but still refused to recognise Macedonia under that name. Mr Kiro Gligorov, Macedonia's president, has said he is willing to sign an agreement guaranteeing the border with Greece. He adds: 'We want to start the dialogue with Greece in New York, under UN sponsorship, and work out a package solution covering all our differences.' Two years of diplomatic and economic isolation have taken a heavy toll, with gross domestic product falling by more than 30 per cent since 1991. Per capita income has dropped by half to less than Dollars 700. Industrial production is collapsing, with Macedonia's steel and nickel producers both close to shutting down because of difficulties in exporting. The textile industry is operating at 30 per cent of capacity, according to government officials. A severe drought cut agricultural output last year by more than 20 per cent and halted exports of early vegetables. On the advice of the International Monetary Fund, Macedonia took the unusual step of asking for donations from abroad to cover repayment of Dollars 85m in debt owed to the World Bank. Although the government hoped that Ecu50m (Pounds 39m) in aid promised last year by EU member states could be used to cover the debt, only Dollars 20m of that amount has been pledged so far, with the US contributing another Dollars 5m. However, Mr George Soros, the international financier, has come to the rescue, promising the Macedonian government a short-term bridging loan. The government has already agreed with the IMF on an economic reform programme, in return for a stand-by facility of Dollars 35m this year. Once its World Bank arrears are covered, Macedonia will be eligible for up to Dollars 140m in fresh loans for infrastructure projects. The best way to revive trade and eventually attract investment, the government says, is to bypass both Greece and Serbia, and build new communications links with Albania, Bulgaria and Turkey.

In another sign of economic strength, the Chicago purchasing managers' index was reported up sharply last month at 65.3 against 57.0 in October, suggesting buoyant conditions for local manufacturers. The jump in the consumer confidence index far exceeded Wall Street projections and prompted a sharp decline in bond prices and a strengthening of the dollar. This reflected traders' fears that more rapid economic growth would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. Share prices, disturbed by the fall in bond prices, rose modestly. 'An improvement of this magnitude has occurred only rarely in the 25-year history of this survey,' said Mr Fabian Linden of the Conference Board, the New York business analysis group that compiles the consumer confidence index. If confidence continued to strengthen 'we can expect pent-up demand to come to market,' he said. The board's latest survey of 5,000 households indicated consumers had become more optimistic about current conditions and about the outlook for the next six months. The proportion rating business conditions 'bad' was the lowest in three years. The proportion rating jobs 'plentiful' was up. The level of consumer confidence remained relatively subdued by the standards of previous recoveries, when the index rose well above 100. The index gain is the last piece in a growth jigsaw. In recent weeks, figures for factory orders, industrial output, retail spending and home sales all pointed to an acceleration of economic growth to an annual rate of about 4 per cent in the current quarter.

The 225-issue index lost 954.19, its biggest one-day drop, to 18,353.24 as investors and brokers who had bought stock ahead of the vote rushed to adjust positions. The Topix index of all first section stocks weakened 70.85, or 4.5 per cent, to 1,499.06 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index recovered 5.77 to 1,243.67. 'It was total confusion,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities, describing the panicky selling which wiped out 4.3 per cent of the market's total equity capitalisation. However, he added that foreign investors were buying some of the shares which domestic investment trusts and financial institutions had unloaded. The vote in the upper house came after the market had closed last Friday, stunning investors who had bought heavily in expectation of the bill's passage. Overseas buying of Japanese shares this year is believed to be on a medium to long term investment basis, offering a relatively low risk of selling on a snap fall in share prices. But an increase in political uncertainty could stall further support from foreign parts. Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said that although prospects of lower interest rates were positive for the stock market, he was cautious on the short term due to the possibility that the cabinet would be forced to resign, which would be followed by a general election next month. The Nikkei opened at the high of the day of 19,294.43 and hit a low of 18,320.33 just before the market closed. More than 80 per cent of first section stocks were left untraded in the first hour of the session due to mounting sell orders and lack of buyers. Volume totalled 360m shares, against 462m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 1,105 to 15, with 17 issues unchanged. Bank shares, which had recently been firm on arbitrage-linked buying, were among the heaviest losers, with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y170 to Y3,080. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gave up Y40,000 to Y840,000, ending its 17-day rising streak. East Japan Railway shed Y35,000 to Y461,000. High-technology stocks faced heavy selling from dealers. Sony retreated Y200 to Y5,660 and Fujitsu Y41 to Y888. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 874.22 to 20,200.56 in volume of 49.8m shares. Roundup If anything, Tokyo's woes diverted funds into other Asian markets, although some brokers said that an extended fall in Japanese stocks could depress the region. BANGKOK forged ahead 3.8 per cent in moderate trading, speculators concentrating on the finance sector in anticipation of strong 1993 earnings. The SET index closed 53.13 higher at 1,461.59 in turnover of Bt13.8bn. The finance sector jumped 7.7 per cent, banks following with a 4 per cent gain. Brokers said Thai investors dominated trading, with foreigners continuing to stay on the sidelines. Nava Finance was up Bt18 to Bt226, Asia Securities Bt11 to Bt128, Dhana Siam Bt44 to Bt578 and Finance One Bt34 to Bt384. BOMBAY put on 2.7 per cent, rising sharply in the second half of the trading session on renewed demand from foreign institutional investors. The BSE index finished at a provisional 3,853.1, up 100.6. Brokers said there was aggressive buying, particularly by Morgan Stanley, which recently attracted Rp9bn in a mutual fund offer, and Unit Trust of India, the country's largest fund of this type. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index ended 36.54, or 1.6 per cent, stronger at 2,318.27, with institutional buying again in evidence. Jurong Shipyard moved forward 80 cents to SDollars 14.30, F  N 80 cents to SDollars 17.50 and Keppel Corp 60 cents to SDollars 11.60. HONG KONG ended higher, but off its peak after profit-taking had trimmed early gains. Brokers said Japanese and US investment houses diverted funds from falling Tokyo stocks into other Asian markets, but profit-taking hit afternoon trade and the Hang Seng index closed a net 140.72, or 1.2 per cent, ahead at 11,600.09, down from a morning high of 11,708.56. Hutchison Whampoa led the market higher on news that it was buying out the management contract of the Hong Kong Hilton. Investors interpreted the move as signall-ing that it would cash in on the redevelopment value of the hotel site and Hutch-ison shares advanced HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 41. SEOUL saw renewed interest in asset play counters and the composite index added 10.21 at 887.96. KUALA LUMPUR finished mostly lower on lack of support, although gains in selected blue chips left the KLSE composite index 0.79 firmer at 1,064.55. AUSTRALIA lost ground as a softer gold price and the plunging Japanese stock market encouraged investors to take profits. The All Ordinaries index closed 25.8 down at 2,224.5 in turnover of ADollars 494.8m, gold shares dropping just over 4 per cent to 2,547.6. KARACHI ended sharply lower for the third straight session, the KSE index losing 68.08 to 2,202.21, although it recovered slightly from a fall of 79.04 one hour before the close.

That is the view of experts in Liaoning, China's oldest  industrial base which has made strenuous efforts since 1991 to  renew its old facilities and enhance the quality of products.    Between 1991 and 1993, the province, employing 33.36 billion  yuan, fulfilled 1,800 projects of technology enhancement.    At the beginning of the 1990s, only 32.5 percent of the  installed equipment in this industrial region, formed as early  as the 1950s, was up to satisfactory 1980s levels, lower than  the country's average standard.    That resulted in the poor quality of processed products and  final products. The output value from the mining and raw  material sectors accounts for over 41 percent of the province's  industrial total.    Focusing on 50 major products, Liaoning's improvement  program  has kept its eye both on domestic and overseas markets in the  past three years.    In the current market economy drive, enterprises in the  province have used flexible means to raise funds. More than 60  percent of the total investment in the improvement project was  self-raised.    In just this way, Huludao Zinc Smeltery has successfully  renovated itself into the world's largest smeltery in the  nonferrous metal industry. Its annual capacity is expected to  reach 400,000 tons, while three years ago it was 100,000 tons.    By the end of 1993, technological progress achieved in  Liaoning had enhanced the proportion of semi-finished products  to final products from 8:2 to 7:3, and in exports, from 81:19 to  66:34.    Medium and large-sized enterprises in the province have also  gained competitive strength, with about 10 percent of them  becoming well-known in markets at home and abroad.     "
0,FT932-2287 ,"FT932-2287 _AN-DFTAMABPFT 930619   FT  19 JUN 93 / Surge in orders for cremator makers      By GILLIAN TETT   MR PAUL HAYWARD does not often reveal his profession at parties. But as one of Britain's longest-established cremator makers he has reason to be decidedly upbeat. With Britain's crematoria due to replace their 700 cremators over the next few years, the country's tiny cremator making business is experiencing a boom. Mr Hayward, cremator director of Cheshire-based Furnace Construction said: 'Britain has been leading the way in cremation and cremator making for some time - this can only help.' The company, like the handful of other cremator makers, is expecting orders to rise by at least 40 per cent next year. Mr Hayward said that in the 50 years he had been in business his cremators had changed considerably. When he started the cremation rate was only 10 per cent. Now the rate is nearly 70 per cent, handling nearly 500,000 incinerations a year. The construction process demands extensive research and development to cope with the demand for environmentally friendly, computerised cremators. As uncertainty over environmental legislation triggered a fall in domestic demand during the 1980s cremator makers tried to expand overseas - Australia, with a 47 per cent cremation rate, has been a fruitful market, while Germany and the Netherlands have also been buyers. In Britain the industry seems set for several years of steady expansion. Mr Max Kingsland, chief executive of the cremator division of Evans Universal, said: 'There aren't many industries where Britain is still strong at home. But this is one of them.' His comapny has a turnover of about Pounds 4m a year from its cremator business.   Companies:-  Furnace Construction.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

If you are not sure whether or not you meet the definition of a small business, you may want to contact your local district office or regional office of the Small Business Administration (SBA) for advice. If you are unable to locate those offices you may call the SBA's Office of Size Standards at (202) 2056618.         Q. May an application including a business partner that is a small local affiliate of a larger corporation receive the small business priority points?         A. The overall size of the business partner and its affiliates will determine the answer. Size determinations must include the business partner and all its domestic and foreign affiliates regardless of whether the affiliates are organized for profit. 13 CFR 121.401 describes affiliating circumstances for size determination purposes and establishes exceptions thereto.         Q. May an application including a business partner that operates as the small local franchisee or licensee of a larger corporation receive the small business priority points?         A. Small business priority points may be awarded when a business partner meets the following three conditions: It (1) is a local franchisee or licensee within the size determination standards, (2) has the right to profit from its efforts and (3) bears the risk of loss commensurate with ownership. Exceptions to this general interpretation may arise where affiliation results from other means than the franchise or license agreement such as common ownership, common management or excessive restrictions on the sale of the franchise interest. See 121.401(m) of 13 CFR.         Q. Must a small business participant be a partner for   the application to qualify for the small business priority points?         A. Yes. The small business participant must be a partner who has signed the Partnership Agreement for the application to qualify for the extra points.         Q. Must an applicant provide the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code for the small business partner in order to receive the small business priority points?         A. Yes. The SIC code must be entered on the line provided on the Partnership Agreement form.         Q. What is meant by a required percent of non-Federal cost-sharing or matching funds?         A. In this program, the recipient of Federal funds is required to ``match'' the Federal grant by paying at least a minimum percentage of total program costs. Total program costs include both the Federal funds received and the non-Federal contribution. For example, a partnership that is required to pay 30 percent of total program costs of $100,000 would have to contribute $30,000 to match a Federal award of $70,000 ($30,000 = 30 percent of $100,000 ($30,000 plus $70,000)). All partnerships must contribute at least 30 percent of total program costs, except that partnerships may receive full reimbursement for their necessary and reasonable administrative costs incurred in establishing a project during the project start-up period. That period should be minimized and may not exceed six months, at which time the project is expected to provide services to adult workers.         Q. What costs may be included in the 30 percent match (cash or in-kind)?     A. Any cost that can be paid with Federal funds from this program is allowable as match (see Education Department General Administrative Regulations, 34 CFR 74.5074.57 and 34 CFR 80.24).         Q. What costs are not allowed using project funds (Federal or non-Federal match)?         A. The following items are not allowable costs in the National Workplace Literacy Program:         Life skills such as balancing a checkbook, learning to read to children, writing personal correspondence, etc.         Personal counseling such as counseling for alcoholism, mental health, health, domestic problems, or housing issues.          Job skills or vocational training such as direct training in statistical process control (SPC) rather than literacy skills needed for SPC.

Any unreasonable or unnecessary cost.         Q. May a project provide vocational or job training activities?         A. No. Projects must provide adult education programs that teach literacy skills needed in the workplace. Workplace literacy activities include only the adult education activities listed in the Description of Program section of the Notice Inviting Applications. This list does not include vocational or job training activities such as auto mechanics, dye casting, tailoring, and statistical process control.

Training to operate a computer that is part of the performance of a job is a form of vocational or job training and is not an eligible activity under this program. However, computers could be used as a means of instruction if this were necessary and reasonable under the circumstances of a particular project. In such a context, it would be permissible to ensure that students possessed those rudimentary skills that are necessary to interact with computer-assisted literacy instruction.

0,FT931-7001 ,"FT931-7001 _AN-DBZCKAEEFT 930226   FT  26 FEB 93 / The ICI Demerger: Focus will be on core businesses      By CLIVE COOKSON and PAUL ABRAHAMS   THE ICI left behind after spinning off Zeneca is the world's sixth largest chemical group, with sales of more than Pounds 8bn a year. It still manufactures a large range of products: from bulk petrochemicals to high-performance plastic films, from chlorine and caustic soda to paint and explosives. However, the range of activities is likely to be much narrower by 2000. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of the new ICI, says the company 'is going to focus during the 1990s on areas where we can be successful globally'. That will mean continuing the process, started two years ago, of selling or closing down activities in which ICI is not one of the world's top three companies. The UK-based petrochemical (olefins and aromatics) and chlor-alkali (chlorine and caustic soda) businesses are high on the disposals list. 'The decision taken in the early 1980s to restrict petrochemicals and chlor-alkali to Europe turned out to be wrong,' says Mr Hampel. 'The error of judgment was to believe that the industry could be operated on a regional rather than a global basis.' He believes that the world petrochemicals industry is about to undergo large-scale restructuring, which will end up with about five global groups manufacturing on an integrated basis from oil and gas feedstocks to finished plastics. ICI is not going to make the investment required to be one of them. Another error of the 1980s, as ICI moved away from bulk commodity chemicals, was to expand into too wide a range of higher value-added products. That too will be corrected, Mr Hampel says. 'Some businesses in the portfolio will not survive. Those that are not global or not making an adequate return on capital must go.' The global businesses on which ICI will be relying for growth to make up for cuts elsewhere include: Paints. ICI is the world's largest paints manufacturer and, with its Dulux and Glidden brands, is particularly strong in decorative finishes. Explosives. The 1990 acquisition of Atlas in the US made ICI the undisputed global leader in explosives. The products are used mainly in mining and quarrying, although ICI hopes that safety airbags for cars will represent a fast-growing new market: a mini-explosion of sodium azide fills the bag with gas in the event of a crash. Chlorofluorocarbon substitutes. Although ICI is losing revenue through the global phase-out of CFCs to protect the ozone layer, it is investing heavily in ozone-friendly hydrofluorocarbons to replace them. The leading substitute HFC134a will be manufactured in the UK, US and Japan. Specialised plastics. By swapping ICI Fibres for Du Pont's acrylics division, ICI became the world's leading producer of acrylics. It is also strong in polyurethane foams and polyester films. The paints and explosives businesses have traded steadily through the recession. During the three years from 1990 to 1992, sales have held at about Pounds 1.6bn a year for paints and Pounds 550m for explosives, while profits were Pounds 115m for paints and Pounds 55m for explosives. The outlook for both divisions is for slow, steady growth in turnover and profits. In contrast, the remaining parts of ICI - materials and industrial chemicals  -have suffered a decline in sales and profits. They made a trading loss of Pounds 42m on Pounds 5.4bn turnover in 1992. There is an opportunity for a sharp revival in profits as the world economy recovers, but analysts see no prospects of the exceptional returns in the late 1980s.

First, there is a difference of view as to whether there is over-capacity or not in this sector of trade. Clearly Tim Smith, the UK economy minister for Northern Ireland, feels that there is unsatisfied, and indeed growing, demand for the product, whereas the European textile industry believes the opposite, a position the Commission initially agreed. Second, the Commission is quoted as saying that the project is of a low-technology nature, whereas the UK government is saying the opposite. Third, the project envisages the creation of 1,850 jobs whereas others contend that this level of employment is improbable. In this regard it is interesting that Tim Smith, in his detailed contribution to the debate in the FT ('A respectable and respected public corporation', June 3), makes no reference to the number of jobs that will be created. I should emphasise that the British Apparel  Textile Confederation is strongly supportive of inward investment in the textile industry in all parts of the UK. However, each case must be judged on its merits and surely, given the contradictions surrounding the Hualon investment, the whole case should now be reviewed by both the Commission and the Industrial Development Board before contracts are signed.

0,FT942-10641 ,"FT942-10641 _AN-EEJC9ABZFT 940510   FT  10 MAY 94 / Farmers to test rapeseed car fuel      By CHRIS TIGHE   Farmway, a co-operative of 2,500 farmers in north-east England, will this week begin running some of its cars and trucks on bio-diesel produced from rapeseed grown on set-aside land. British Bio-Diesel - a consortium formed by a group of Durham farmers; Farmway; specialist seed crusher Unitrition; and chemical manufacturer Chemoxy - has produced 4,000 gallons of bio-diesel, believed to be the UK's first. The trial, by seven Farmway vehicles normally run on conventional diesel, will test vehicle emissions. A North Yorkshire Peugeot dealer's courtesy car will also use the fuel to gauge public reaction. Engine performance will be evaluated by Perkins Engines and Lucas. The consortium believes bio-diesel is an environmentally friendly fuel which offers farmers a productive use for set-aside land. Farmway is paying members Pounds 98 a tonne for the rapeseed. That does not affect set-aside payments. The initiative was started by the farmers of the East Durham Bio-Diesel Working Group. They say bio-diesel is cleaner than conventional fuels and, if spilt, is 95 per cent biodegradable within three weeks and fully within five. Farmer Mr David Cowton said the quantity of bio-diesel which could be produced from UK set-aside land would not supplant ordinary diesel but it would be attractive in environmentally sensitive areas such as waterways. The consortium hopes the UK government will grant it pilot plant status for its production facilities in North Yorkshire and on Teesside. That would greatly reduce the fuel tax burden while markets are sought for bio-diesel and its rapemeal and glycerine by-products. If fully taxed, said Mr Cowton, bio-diesel would be about 50 per cent more expensive than ordinary diesel. Crop worries, Page 28   Companies:-  Farmway.     British Bio-Diesel.

ACTION:     Call for nominations.                 SUMMARY:     The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is inviting nominations of physicians, having expert qualifications in the medical specialty field of Radiation Oncology (Therapy), to apply for positions as Medical Visiting Fellows (Fellows). Others having expert qualifications in related fields such as Therapeutic Radiological Physics are also invited to apply.            EFFECTIVE DATE:         Objectives.     NRC is seeking to expand its knowledge of the medical specialty of radiation oncology. Specifically, the therapeutic uses of radioisotopes in brachytherapy patient procedures. Recently, significant misadministrations have occurred involving errors in the delivery of the prescribed radiation dose to the patient during either manual or remote afterloading brachytherapy procedures. As a result of evaluating the circumstances surrounding these events, NRC has identified the need to re-evaluate certain aspects of its regulatory program to determine whether modifications are indicated.             NRC intends to keep abreast of this technology and future developments in the therapeutic uses of radioisotopes and believes that such a Fellow, with expertise in these uses, can assist NRC staff in meeting this goal. The program is open to physicians interested in seeking an appointment for individual sabbatical pursuits. Other radiation specialists on sabbatical, or those who wish to engage in post-doctoral research, will also be considered. Individuals participating as Fellows would join NRC for approximately one year, to undertake activities consistent with the interests and needs of NRC and with the individual's training and experience; and that will result in a clearly defined assignment useful to NRC's regulatory program. Ideally, each Fellow would be available to NRC on a full-time basis; however, NRC will consider nominees who are available only on a part-time basis. Additionally, the number of appointments made will depend on the range of skills embodied in the nominations, individuals' interests and needs of NRC.    In addition to a specific assignment, or research project, it is anticipated that the Fellow would attend meetings of NRC's Advisory Committee on the Medical Uses of Isotopes (ACMUI); Federal, State, and local agencies; professional organizations; and groups, to participate in discussions on issues related to medical affairs and the use of radiation in medicine. The selectee may also participate in public meetings and seminars sponsored by NRC for exchanging information and discussing issues, of mutual interest, that will benefit the regulation of medical practice. A collateral goal is to create a cadre of individuals with experience in the regulation of medical use of isotopes; therefore, it is likely that former Fellows may be asked to participate, from time to time, in NRC-sponsored meetings and seminars after their appointment ends, to provide advice and consultation about the regulated program.    Therefore, NRC is primarily soliciting nominations of physicians involved with the medical use of radioisotopes, but will be pleased to receive nominations of other radiation health professionals and medical radiation specialists to serve as Fellows.        Appointment Method.     Appointments will be made by means of Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignment, reimbursable detail, or professional term appointment, depending on the selectee's situation.        Term of Appointment.     The term of appointment will be approximately one year. Appointments may be lengthened, depending on the depth and scope of the Fellow's project, availability and the needs of the NRC, to approximately two years.        Compensation.     Fellows will receive compensation commensurate with their experience, salary history, and federal pay guidelines while serving their appointment. Fellows will be reimbursed for official travel and relocation expenses.        Duty Location.     Fellows may be assigned to any Office in NRC, including the Office of the Commissioners, consistent with the interests and needs of NRC and the individual's training and experience. The duty location is at NRC Headquarters, Rockville, Maryland. It is anticipated that there will be some travel associated with this position.        Eligibility Requirements.     NRC is an equal opportunity employer. Nominees must be U.S. citizens. Nominees must also satisfy applicable, NRC security, conflict of interest, and drug-free work place standards. Eligibility is open to physicians specializing in Radiation Oncology (Radiation Therapy), or medical physicists specializing in Therapeutic Radiological Physics. Other nominees will also be considered based on the needs of NRC and the individual's interest.        How to Nominate.     Candidates may be nominated by professional groups, medical societies, government agencies, or may be self-nominated. Nominations must provide the nominee's current address and telephone number and include a resume describing the educational and professional qualifications of the nominee. A brief statement of the Individual's professional objectives should also be included.        Where to Submit Nominations.     Submit nominations to: Secretary of the Commission.

Although the results were broadly in line with expectations, Wall Street was disappointed. Annual earnings increased by 19 per cent in both 1991 and 1990, and by 24 per cent in 1989. Shares in Merck closed down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 39 1/2 Fourth-quarter results were distorted by the adoption of new accounting standards, which brought net income for the three months to Dollars 609.1m, or 53 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.6bn. In the same period of 1991, Merck earned 529.8m, or 46 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.31bn. For the full year, Merck had net income of Dollars 1.98bn, or Dollars 1.72 a share, 6 per cent below earnings of Dollars 2.12bn, or Dollars 1.83 cents, posted in 1991. Stripping out after-tax charges of Dollars 462.4m, or 40 cents, for the adoption of new accounting standards, net income rose 17 per cent to Dollars 2.49bn, or Dollars 2.15 cents, in 1992. Sales were 12 per cent higher at Dollars 9.66bn, against Dollars 8.6bn, with growth being lead by newer products. Some analysts have been disappointed by the performance of Proscar, Merck's new drug to treat benign prostate enlargement, but Mr Arvind Desai, an analyst at Mehta  Isaly in New York, said: 'We still expect Proscar to be a Dollars 1bn drug, with 1993 sales of about Dollars 150m.'

0,FT943-8230 ,"FT943-8230 _AN-EHRD3ADJFT 940818   FT  18 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: ABB   The doubling of the Asea and Brown Boveri share prices over the past 18 months has been driven partly by ABB's growth prospects in East Asia. So its comments yesterday about mounting competition and falling prices, particularly in China, were unsettling. While too much should not be read into one half's figures, it was perhaps significant that margins in power generation, which is heavily biased towards East Asia, slipped back in the first six months although the group figure rose from 7.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent. This improvement is the reward for years of painful cost cutting which has seen production shifted to low cost centres in eastern Europe and Asia. The process continued in the first half, with the group wage bill down 3 per cent compared with a year before. The group's margin target of 10 per cent looks within reach over the next couple of years and the combination of recovery in Europe, continued growth in East Asia and a falling tax charge could lead to a near doubling of earnings by 1996. That would put the shares of Brown Boveri, the Swiss parent company, on a multiple of around 12. Shares in Sweden's Asea, which owns the other half of ABB, have proved less popular with international investors recently and their multiple of 1996 earnings is down to little more than 10. The ratings are in line with other European capital goods companies with arguably poorer growth prospects. The worry is that the pressure on prices in East Asia will absorb all ABB's efforts on cost. If so, its fatter rivals are in for a very painful ride.   Companies:-  ABB Asea Brown Boveri.   Countries:-  CHZ  Switzerland, West Europe.     SEZ  Sweden, West Europe.

0," LA091989-0082   109431    September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition      Business; Part 4; Page 9A; Column 1      1510 words      NEW CHIEF OF PACIFIC SOUTHWEST HOPES TO FIND STRENGTH IN DIVERSITY      By PATRICE APODACA, Times Staff Writer      Pacific Southwest Corp. is a quirky little concern with an eclectic variety of  businesses.    It owns 384 acres of largely undeveloped land in northern San Diego County; it  counts kiwi farms, beehives and industrial sewing machines among its assets; it  services commercial and residential mortgage loans and leases cars and  computers, and it picks, packs and stores crops from farms owned by others.    The Northridge-based company, founded in 1980 by President Jerry Fraschilla,  has always been a bit short on a long-term game plan, which helps explain its  detours into unusual businesses. ""When I originally started, it was not with a  preconceived idea,"" Fraschilla said. ""It just sort of evolved.""    And the company just sort of drifted into obscurity. Although Pacific Southwest  has been consistently profitable -- it earned $123,402 on $1.9 million in sales  for the nine months that ended April 30 -- its stock has all but been ignored  by institutional investors. The stock trades on the so-called ""pink sheets""  over-the-counter market, which lists small, thinly traded stocks that don't  attract much attention.      Work Same Magic    But William Hutchinson, president of Hutchinson Securities, a San Francisco  investment banking firm, recently bought a 1% stake in Pacific Southwest and  was elected to the firm's board of directors. Hutchinson is betting that  Pacific Southwest's newest asset -- its chairman, Ronald Langley, 45 -- will be  able to work the same kind of magic for the tiny company that he did while  working for New Zealand's second-largest company, Brierley Investments.    ""With Ron Langley there, we'll have no difficulty in attracting additional  capital for further expansion,"" Hutchinson said. By using Langley's contacts,  Fraschilla said he is hoping to turn Pacific Southwest into a national  financial services company.    Langley is also wagering on his ability to turn Pacific Southwest into a  success story. One of his first steps was investing $1 million to buy 333,333  shares, or about 17% of Pacific Southwest's stock, and he received options to  buy another 333,333 shares at $5 each. (Fraschilla and his family own about 24%  of the company.)    But building another success figures to be a lot tougher this time around for  Langley. Brierley is a huge international concern with $7 billion in assets and  access to virtually unlimited sources of capital, while Pacific Southwest's net  worth, based on the difference between its assets and debt, is a mere $4  million, with little extra cash for investments.    Langley says the company could easily raise $2 million for investments or  acquisitions with its existing cash and assets. But if Pacific Southwest's  plans are big, that won't go too far. And raising money by selling more stock  doesn't seem like an option given the company's meager appeal among large  investors.    What it all comes down to is that the pressure is on Langley to not only find  crackerjack investments, but to also lure enough big partners to help share the  risk of those investments.    Despite these obstacles, Langley is bold enough to say that his plan is to  attract a larger company that will buy into Pacific Southwest with a  $10-million to $20-million investment and provide the resources necessary for a  more significant expansion. The lure for such an investor will be his history  of spotting profitable investments, he said.    ""We're starting with a smaller size,"" Langley said. ""But if we come up with an  attractive enough investment, we can always get financing. Our equity portion  might be smaller, but if it's good enough, there's always a way of making the  investment work.""    Langley is already checking out investment opportunities to exploit in  financial services, particularly since the savings and loan crisis has left  many insolvent thrifts ready to dump assets such as mortgage operations and  real estate.      Move Fast    Peter Brook, an analyst at the New Zealand brokerage Hendry Hay McIntosh Ltd.,  said he expects Langley to move fast.    ""The only difference is he won't have the capital base to work with initially  and the deals will be smaller,"" Brook said. ""You'll see him buy perhaps some  unusual companies that might not look like much, but he'll be able to do  something with them.""    This faith in Langley stems from his track record when he worked for Sir Ronald  Brierley, who was chairman of Brierley Investments until a recent change of  control. Brierley isn't a big name to most Americans, but he's a big-time  investor who became an international figure by investing in companies in  Australia, Europe and the United States.    Since moving here from his native Australia in 1984, Langley served as  executive director of Industrial Equity Pacific Ltd., Brierley's North American  investment group. And Langley followed Brierley's investment style, which  involves looking for undervalued businesses, no matter how offbeat or eclectic  they might be.    ""Langley was very much a Brierley's man,"" said Michael Willis, an analyst at  James Capel & Co., a London brokerage firm.      $1-Billion Portfolio    In those five years, Langley built Industrial Equity's portfolio of U.S.  investments from $2 million to about $1 billion. Langley bought Everest &  Jennings, the Los Angeles wheelchair manufacturer; bought and sold Higbee Co.,  a Cleveland department store chain, and at one time owned a stake in Calmat  Co., a Los Angeles cement maker, and Resorts International, the Atlantic City  gambling and hotel chain.    Langley claims Higbee as his biggest coup. Higbee was foundering through a  depressed local economy in 1984 when Langley started buying stock. ""The broker  I first gave the order to thought that I was a bit of a madman"" because the  firm was in such bad shape, he said.    But Langley saw a talented retail team and valuable underlying assets at  Higbee, such as real estate that would eventually bounce back from the slump.  Brierley acquired the company for $72 million and sold it three years later for  $165 million.    After spending 14 years amassing investments for someone else, Langley wanted  to do it for himself. ""I was looking to have more equity in what I did next,""  he said.    That next step became Pacific Southwest. Actually, Fraschilla initially  approached Langley and tried to get Industrial Equity to make a $10-million  investment in Pacific Southwest. The deal never materialized, but Fraschilla  and Langley hit it off.      Boost in Net Worth    A few months later, Langley quit his post with Brierley to become chairman at  Pacific Southwest. Langley's $1-million investment helped boost the firm's net  worth to at least $4 million, the minimum required for the company's stock to  be listed on the higher profile National Assn. of Securities Dealers National  Market list. Having its stock traded on NASDAQ might eventually help Pacific  Southwest sell more stock to raise money for its expansion.    In the meantime, Langley and Fraschilla hope that the encroaching development  from San Diego and Orange counties will soon catch up to the firm's land  holdings near Escondido and Ramona, giving them the opportunity to profit from  land sales or to take part in developments. That might not happen soon, though,  since zoning changes in northern San Diego County are often tough to come by.    ""Just having the land alone won't guarantee the next step,"" said Hugh Sinnock,  head of the San Diego office of W. Ross Campbell, a mortgage banking company.  ""But if it's in the direction of growth, it's just a matter of time.""    The company's other operations remain small and exist largely to generate  income so Pacific Southwest can afford to hang onto the land.      Retired in 1973    Fraschilla, 52, retired as Technicolor's vice president of corporate  development in 1973 and got into the real estate business. He opened Pacific  Southwest in 1980 and two years later started a mortgage brokerage business to  avoid paying fees on land he bought and sold.    This year, the mortgage business, which collects fees on loans originated by  lending institutions, expects to handle about $180 million in residential  mortgages and up to $60 million in commercial loans, including those processed  through mortgage businesses in the Bay Area and Santa Ana that Pacific  Southwest recently agreed to acquire. Those loans would produce between $1.5  million and $3 million in pretax income, Fraschilla said.    The company also leases such equipment as cars, computers, sewing machines and  medical equipment, and it remains in various agricultural businesses.    Langley said he plans to stay in all those businesses and expand them as  quickly as possible while searching out opportunities such as Higbee that would  interest other investors and give Pacific Southwest the chance to buy assets on  the cheap.    All of his grand plans, of course, turn on whether he can come up with the  money to pay for these ventures. ""But I've always found in the past that if an  idea is good enough, you'll always find someone with the money,"" Langley said.    Stockholders in Pacific Southwest can only wish him good hunting.

Founded in 1980 by  Jetty Fraschilla, the company owns 384 acres of farm land in northern San Diego  County. For fiscal years ended July 31; in millions, MATT MOODY / Los Angeles  Times    "," LA091989-0082   109431    September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition      Business; Part 4; Page 9A; Column 1      1510 words      NEW CHIEF OF PACIFIC SOUTHWEST HOPES TO FIND STRENGTH IN DIVERSITY      By PATRICE APODACA, Times Staff Writer      Pacific Southwest Corp. is a quirky little concern with an eclectic variety of  businesses.    It owns 384 acres of largely undeveloped land in northern San Diego County; it  counts kiwi farms, beehives and industrial sewing machines among its assets; it  services commercial and residential mortgage loans and leases cars and  computers, and it picks, packs and stores crops from farms owned by others.    The Northridge-based company, founded in 1980 by President Jerry Fraschilla,  has always been a bit short on a long-term game plan, which helps explain its  detours into unusual businesses. ""When I originally started, it was not with a  preconceived idea,"" Fraschilla said. ""It just sort of evolved.""    And the company just sort of drifted into obscurity. Although Pacific Southwest  has been consistently profitable -- it earned $123,402 on $1.9 million in sales  for the nine months that ended April 30 -- its stock has all but been ignored  by institutional investors. The stock trades on the so-called ""pink sheets""  over-the-counter market, which lists small, thinly traded stocks that don't  attract much attention.      Work Same Magic    But William Hutchinson, president of Hutchinson Securities, a San Francisco  investment banking firm, recently bought a 1% stake in Pacific Southwest and  was elected to the firm's board of directors. Hutchinson is betting that  Pacific Southwest's newest asset -- its chairman, Ronald Langley, 45 -- will be  able to work the same kind of magic for the tiny company that he did while  working for New Zealand's second-largest company, Brierley Investments.    ""With Ron Langley there, we'll have no difficulty in attracting additional  capital for further expansion,"" Hutchinson said. By using Langley's contacts,  Fraschilla said he is hoping to turn Pacific Southwest into a national  financial services company.    Langley is also wagering on his ability to turn Pacific Southwest into a  success story. One of his first steps was investing $1 million to buy 333,333  shares, or about 17% of Pacific Southwest's stock, and he received options to  buy another 333,333 shares at $5 each. (Fraschilla and his family own about 24%  of the company.)    But building another success figures to be a lot tougher this time around for  Langley. Brierley is a huge international concern with $7 billion in assets and  access to virtually unlimited sources of capital, while Pacific Southwest's net  worth, based on the difference between its assets and debt, is a mere $4  million, with little extra cash for investments.    Langley says the company could easily raise $2 million for investments or  acquisitions with its existing cash and assets. But if Pacific Southwest's  plans are big, that won't go too far. And raising money by selling more stock  doesn't seem like an option given the company's meager appeal among large  investors.    What it all comes down to is that the pressure is on Langley to not only find  crackerjack investments, but to also lure enough big partners to help share the  risk of those investments.    Despite these obstacles, Langley is bold enough to say that his plan is to  attract a larger company that will buy into Pacific Southwest with a  $10-million to $20-million investment and provide the resources necessary for a  more significant expansion. The lure for such an investor will be his history  of spotting profitable investments, he said.    ""We're starting with a smaller size,"" Langley said. ""But if we come up with an  attractive enough investment, we can always get financing. Our equity portion  might be smaller, but if it's good enough, there's always a way of making the  investment work.""    Langley is already checking out investment opportunities to exploit in  financial services, particularly since the savings and loan crisis has left  many insolvent thrifts ready to dump assets such as mortgage operations and  real estate.      Move Fast    Peter Brook, an analyst at the New Zealand brokerage Hendry Hay McIntosh Ltd.,  said he expects Langley to move fast.    ""The only difference is he won't have the capital base to work with initially  and the deals will be smaller,"" Brook said. ""You'll see him buy perhaps some  unusual companies that might not look like much, but he'll be able to do  something with them.""    This faith in Langley stems from his track record when he worked for Sir Ronald  Brierley, who was chairman of Brierley Investments until a recent change of  control. Brierley isn't a big name to most Americans, but he's a big-time  investor who became an international figure by investing in companies in  Australia, Europe and the United States.    Since moving here from his native Australia in 1984, Langley served as  executive director of Industrial Equity Pacific Ltd., Brierley's North American  investment group. And Langley followed Brierley's investment style, which  involves looking for undervalued businesses, no matter how offbeat or eclectic  they might be.

Bank of Spain figures yesterday showed a current account shortfall of Pta532bn (Pounds 2.6bn) for the six months against Pta791bn at the same stage a year ago. The deficit in June was 21 per cent down at Pta138bn, with the traditional surplus in services boosted by 76 per cent to Pta199bn. The services surplus over the six-month period was 47 per cent higher at Pta726bn. Net tourism receipts of Pta960bn were 30 per cent up since last year. Spain's merchandise trade deficit, meanwhile, was 10 per cent lower in the first half at Pta820bn, according to the bank's figures. Portugal's balance of payments deficit on current account rose to Es145.9bn (Pounds 590m) in the first five months of this year compared with Es107.2bn in the same period last year, the Bank of Portugal said. Poland's unadjusted industrial output fell 3.4 per cent in July, but was 16.7 per cent higher than in July 1993, according to the central statistical office. Unemployment in the Netherlands rose on an unadjusted basis to an average of 465,000 in May-July from 461,000 in April-June, the central bureau of statistics said. The Danish national statistics agency reported the trade surplus in April fell to DKr2.12bn (Pounds 223m) on an unadjusted basis from DKr3.382bn a year earlier. The April trade balance also showed a decline from March this year, when the balance stood at DKr3.031bn.   Countries:-  ESZ  Spain, EC.     PTZ  Portugal, EC.     PLZ  Poland, East Europe.

0,FT944-16148 ,"FT944-16148 _AN-EJND7AFGFT 941014   FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: British Steel to spend Pounds 97m on US mini-mill      By ANDREW BAXTER   British Steel yesterday announced its biggest single investment project for four years with a plan to spend Pounds 97m building a 1m-ton-a-year plate mini-mill at Tuscaloosa Steel, its Alabama subsidiary. The plan, which has been under consideration for several months, is the strongest evidence yet of British Steel's more expansionist investment policy after years of restricted spending during the recession. It will also mark the first time the company has made steel in a wholly-owned overseas plant. Tuscaloosa is currently a rolling mill, using slabs of steel - the raw material for plates - supplied mainly from Teesside and Port Talbot. Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, said the expansion was designed to create an internationally competitive mini-mill to produce quality plate in coil and cut-length form. 'Tuscaloosa's objective is to become the most cost-effective supplier in the US plate market, and this investment is an important step forward in British Steel's overseas expansion plans,' he said. Tuscaloosa produces about 500,000 tons a year of steel plate, with annual sales of about Dollars 190m (Pounds 120.2m). Employment will rise from 290 to about 420 when the expanded plant starts operating in late 1996. The expansion will allow Tuscaloosa to produce wider, thicker plate, serving a broader range of applications. Industry experts praised the move. Dr Rod Beddows, chairman of Beddows  Co, the international consultancy, said it was potentially profitable. The mini-mill would be able to offer a higher-quality, lower-cost product than conventionally produced plate. Tuscaloosa uses 250,000 tons of slabs a year. British Steel said there were no job implications for UK steelworks from the future loss of business.   Companies:-  British Steel.     Tuscaloosa Steel.

0,FT931-5585 ,"FT931-5585 _AN-DCEB6AB4FT 930305   FT  05 MAR 93 / Foreign waste may force larger N-dump      By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent   NIREX, the controversial planned store for nuclear waste at Sellafield, might have to be 10 per cent larger than expected if British Nuclear Fuels wins backing for its proposals for treating foreign customers' nuclear waste. BNF, which is battling to get approval for its Pounds 2.8bn Thorp plant for reprocessing nuclear fuel, has repeatedly said Sellafield would not be a nuclear dustbin for other countries' waste because plutonium, uranium and highly radioactive waste would be sent back to customers. Under proposals for 'waste substitution' being considered by the government BNF would send back to foreign customers' a greater degree of high-level radioactive waste but keep the more bulky low-level and intermediate-level waste in Britain. BNF said storage of that waste could push up the necessary capacity of Nirex's proposed rock chamber by 10 per cent. Critics have argued that the plant might not generate the cashflow that BNF projects - Pounds 900m in the first decade of operation - partly because waste storage costs could rise. BNF denied that its substitution plans had any effect on Thorp's economics. 'Substitution is just a more elegant solution because it means shipping back a lower volume,' it said. One tonne of reprocessed fuel produces 10 cubic cm of high-level waste, a cubic metre of intermediate-level waste and six cubic metres of low-level waste. Environmentalists have attacked the Nirex proposals because of the possible risk of groundwater contamination. Nirex, which agreed with BNF's estimates of the possible increase in capacity, said 'it would not be a problem in any case - our estimates of storage are plus or minus 10 per cent'.

Although the business diffusion index  (coincident index) stayed above the ``boom or bust'' threshold  of 50 for the three months from February to April, in  May the  index fell considerable below this level. In terms of production  and employment trends, there is a strong possibility that the  figures for June and July will also fall below this level. While  production in June increased when compared to the previous  month, the level was low and even the inventory cycle shows  signs of a mild recession. Employment conditions continue to  deteriorate and individual consumption is sluggish, for the most  part. Moreover, machinery orders (private demand), a leading  indicator of capital spending, are as weak as ever. On the other  hand, housing investments continue to recover and investment in  public utilities is also firm.    Industrial Activity    The index of industrial production for June (preliminary  reports) increased 1.3 compared with the previous month.  On an  industry specific basis, all industries except plastic goods and  mining had increases. The index of producers' shipments  increased 2.1 compared with the previous month. Although  iron  and steel, plastic goods and mining were down, all other  industries had increases. Because inventories of iron and steel,  general machinery and transport machinery increased, the index  of producers' inventories rose 0.4 compared with the  previous  month. However, because the increase in shipments exceeded this,  the index of the producers' inventory ratio fell 1.2  during  the same period. The forecast index of industrial activity  (seasonally adjusted) has forecast that production will increase  0.1 in July compared to the previous month and fall  0.9 in  August for the same period.    Capital Spending    Looking at concurrent indicators, the June index of capital  goods shipments (excluding transportation machinery) increased  3.0 over the previous month, mainly for general-use steam  turbines and compressors. According to leading indicators, in  June machinery orders (private demand excluding that for ships  and electric power) only had a mild increase of 0.8  overall  compared with the previous month because even though the  manufacturing industry (up 12.0 compared with the  previous  month) had increases (mainly for electronic and communications  equipment), the non-manufacturing sector (down 6.6  during the  same period) declined. Construction orders (private sector) in  June were down for both the manufacturing industry (down  50.0  compared with the previous year) and the non-manufacturing  industry (down 17.8 during the same period) and as a  result  there was an overall decline of 24.7 compared to the  previous  year. This was the 15th consecutive month of decline.    Housing Investment    Comparing the number of housing starts in June to those of  the previous year we find that while rental units declined for  the second consecutive month, owner-occupied units had their  first upward shift in three months while subdivided units also  had large increases for the second consecutive month. This  resulted in an overall increase of 4.1 compared with the  previous year, for a total of 134,000 starts (seasonally  adjusted annualized rate of 1,447 thousand units). (A breakdown  of the raw (unadjusted) figures shows: 49,000 owner-occupied  homes, up 3.8 from the previous year; 60,000 rental  units,  down 1.2 during the same period; 3,000 subsidized housing  units, down 16.0 during the same period; and 22,000  subdivided  units, up 26.6 during the same period.)    Consumption    According to household surveys, in May nominal consumption  expenditures by all households fell 1.1 compared to the  same  period the previous year (real expenditures decreased 1.8  during the same period), the first decline in three months  compared with the previous year. A breakdown of these results  shows that the only three items of expenditure which had  increases were light and heat, water and insured medical  treatment and that, with the exception of cultural  entertainment, which remained flat, all other items had  declines. In particular, sundry and housing expenditures  declined dramatically. By household category, worker households'  consumption expenditures decreased by 0.5 compared to the  previous year while general households' consumption also had a  decrease of 2.3 for the same period.    In June total sales by large retail outlets declined  3.5  over the previous year (down 4.8 after adjusting for the  number of branches). This was the eleventh consecutive month of  decline. Reflecting the unseasonable weather, sales of summer  gifts had a slow start and the slump in sales of summer clothing  continues, particularly for men's clothing. On a sector specific  basis, department store sales fell 7.6 during this period  (clothing down 7.7, food and beverages down 5.1,  others down  9.3) and supermarket sales increased 1.2 during  the same  period (clothing up 0.7, food and beverages up  2.0, others  up 0.6). Still, supermarkets are down 1.2  compared with last  year after adjusting for the number of stores.    Employment    Looking at the employment situation for June (preliminary  reports), the index of regular employment for all industries  remains unchanged when compared with that of the previous month.  The demand for labor continues to show signs of easing and the  effective openings-to-applications ratio fell 0.07 points  compared to the previous month to 0.74. In addition, at  2.50  the total unemployment rate was 0.02 percentage points lower  than that of the previous month. Overtime hours for the  manufacturing industry decreased 2.1 compared to the  previous  month (12.0 hours/month).     "

Counterfeiters are now using advanced technology to  make fake notes and water stamps, according to security sources.    The Putuo branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank in  Shanghai confiscated forged banknotes valued at more than 20,000  yuan from January to June last year. The bank estimated all its  14 branches in Shanghai could seize more than 300,000 yuan of  bogus money in a year as the forged notes kept flooding the  market. Sources close to the police said laymen would find it  difficult to tell if the notes were genuine.    In an attempt to prevent the banknotes from circulating,  banks in China will confiscate all the forged notes when  enterprises and individuals turn in their counterfeited notes.  The forged notes usually get into the market through business  transactions. People who accidentally get banknotes will have  to bear the loss. Some victims said they preferred getting fake  goods to fake money. Experts in the field of finance said the  authorities had to enhance the awareness of businessmen and  citizens to counterfeit currencies.    Counterfeiters also illegally print and sell invoices which  resulted in a disruption of the financial system. Sources said  some enterprises had commissioned unauthorised or underground  printing plants to produce invoices to cheat tax departments.  The invoices are also being used by unscrupulous civil servants  and businessmen to claim expenses.    The authorities have raided many printing plants in  different  areas and have seized printing equipment, half-finished  products, and end products of unauthorised invoices. Recently,  the tax department of Chengdu, Sichuan province, raided 743  state-owned and private printing plants in the area, and 39 were  found to have been involved making fake invoices.     "

The Pounds 24m plan, which is being backed by the Industrial Development Board, will result in 400 jobs and a purpose-built factory at Magherafelt in south Londonderry. The announcement is particularly timely as the town was devastated by an IRA bomb earlier this year. That followed the closure of two large factories last year. The investment programme will also add 200 new jobs and improve the efficiency of the company's existing Northern Ireland plants. The company currently employs 2,700 in 11 factories across the province. Mr Robert Atkins, Northern Ireland's economy minister, said: 'The fact that most of the investment is going to Magherafelt is good news for a town which has suffered a number of setbacks in the last year. 'Growing demand for Desmond ladieswear - such as shorts and pyjamas - is the largest single reason for the new investment throughout the group.' Mr Clinton Silver, deputy chairman of Marks and Spencer, Desmond's main customer, said the company's ability to compete successfully against international competition was a clear indication of how M and S regarded the company's ability to work to world-class standards. Desmond has bought the former Coats Vyella factory in Magherafelt which it will use for pilot production while the new plant is built on a site near the town. Mr Denis Desmond, company chairman, said: 'The new investment programme forms a core of our current five-year strategy. The key factors in this strategy, as in the past, will be market intelligence, design and speed of response.'   Companies:-  Desmond and Sons.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT931-15407 ,"FT931-15407 _AN-DAMCCACPFT 930113   FT  13 JAN 93 / Personal View: The missing link in Britain's economy      By NEIL JOHNSON   Industrial strategy is the vital missing component of the UK's market economy. It is not possible for market forces to allocate resources efficiently unless the markets know and understand what they are doing. Macroeconomic and financial policy alone are not enough. Industrial strategy means developing a common understanding about the role of industry in the economy and the direction of technological and industrial progress. Despite Britain's success in improving productivity during the 1980s, there is an urgent need to rebuild confidence in UK industry. The nation has a chronic trade deficit, a persistent recession and rising unemployment. There is not enough productive capacity in UK manufacturing and too much capacity in financial services. The country has expectations for living standards which the economy will be unable to deliver in the immediate future. It will be unable to deliver them at all unless industry is rebuilt. The UK is reaping the results of 20 years of myopic complacency. Too many political and business leaders were misled into believing that manufacturing industry had become unimportant. In truth, prosperity depends more than ever on technology and industry. Service industries are rarely able to improve their productivity or service quality by their own efforts alone. They usually need new and improved - or more affordable - equipment. Many people seem to think that 'technology' means machines and equipment. But machines and equipment - and the software for their operation - are only the products of technology. Technology is the practical capability to produce goods or services. It is therefore about people, their skills and knowledge and the ways they are organised. 'High technology' businesses are the ones which require high levels of specialised skill, knowledge and organisation. It takes time for industry to accumulate expertise, to build cohesive teams and to establish a strong market position. Therefore, to achieve industrial competitiveness normally requires decades of persistent activity, not just a few years. Strategic vision and consistency of policy by companies, by their financial investors and by government are crucial. This cannot be achieved by macroeconomic policy alone. Hence the need for a coherent and sustained industrial strategy. Achieving it, though, will require a new approach by industry, government, education and the financial world. That is why the Engineering Employers' Federation published its industrial strategy proposals in late November. The federation argues that industry must develop its own strategic thinking and look for organic growth, not just acquisitions. Government must stimulate and co-ordinate strategic thinking and take the lead in developing a 'vision' of how technology can be developed to national advantage. Neither the ideas nor the action to develop them need originate with government, but it has an essential role as catalyst and stimulant. The government's active role must include shifting the policy emphasis from scientific research to technological development; and maintaining support for technology through to full commercial development. This involves not only government-funded RD but also many other governmental activity, including public purchasing; the regulation of telecommunications, energy and transport industries; provision of infrastructure; and provision of education and training. These needs are not met by existing government policy and departmental structure. There is much to welcome in the detail of recent government actions, but as yet there is no sign of strategic thinking. There needs to be a powerful unit with overall responsibility for industrial strategy, backed by the willing and active co-operation of all government departments. Otherwise, the present over-emphasis of the short term and fragmentation of policy will continue. The federation hopes that the Department of Trade and Industry's competitiveness unit is now 'benchmarking' the UK's performance, including that of government, against its successful competitors. Merely gathering information on what other countries do is not in itself a strategy. This, and much other information, must be used for industry and government jointly to develop strategic thinking in the context of the country's own situation and its own creative energies. Only then would it have the essential background of knowledge and understanding for market forces to function effectively.

A number of policy-related banks will be set  up to engage in policy-related business.    Prior to 1978, the People's Bank of China was the only one  in  the nation. It was not only the bank for monetary issue, but  also the center for credit, settlement and cash receipt and  payment. Therefore, it was dubbed a monetary issue company or  state treasury.    At the end of 1978, China embarked on its reform and opening  policies. Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform  and opening, instructed in 1979 that ""banks should be real  banks,"" which raised the curtain on the country's financial  system reform.    Between 1979 and 1985, the Agricultural Bank of China and  the  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China were set up; the Bank of  China was separated from the People's Bank of China as a  specialized exchange bank engaging in international settlement  and foreign trade credit; the People's Construction Bank of  China became independent from the Ministry of Finance to handle  part of credit business. In 1984, the People's Bank of China  began to act as the central bank.    From 1986 to 1993, China established nine commercial banks,  including the Bank of Communications, the CITIC Industrial Bank,  the Merchant Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Fujian  Industrial Bank, the Guangdong Development Bank, the Everbright  Bank, the Huaxia Bank and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.  Their emergence put an end to the monopoly of state specialized  banks and promoted competition in China's banking industry.    However, economic operations over the last 10 years have  exposed undeniable shortcomings in the existing financial  system. The central bank does not behave like a central bank,  and neither do the commercial banks act accordingly. With its  macroregulation and control measures still characteristic with  those of a planned economy, the central bank fails to play its  due role in implementing the state monetary policy and in  managing and supervising national financial activities. It  handles its own policy related loans and runs investment and  trust companies. In the interim, the specialized banks handle  commercial as well as policy-related business. With fund  operations conducted in accordance with planned indicators and  administrative instructions, the specialized banks have no  autonomy to choose where to put money and therefore credit risk  does not exist.    The still not thoroughly reformed financial system certainly  failed to withstand the pounding of the socialist market economy  and the rapid development of the national economy after 1992.  In the first half of 1993 chaotic phenomena like fraudulence in  money raising and loan calling cropped up in the financial  market. This aggravated the excessive growth of investment in  capital construction and fixed assets, inflation and steep price  increases.    The Chinese government shifted the focus of reform and  opening onto finance.    On July 2, 1993, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was appointed  president of the People's Bank of China, a post concurrent with  his existing one. As soon as he took office, Zhu called a  working conference on national finance. Zhu put forward the 14  measures for macroregulation and control, trying to reverse the  chaotic situation in finance through rectifying the financial  order and strictly enforcing financial discipline so the  national economy could revert to the road of continuous, rapid  and healthy development. The efforts have created favorable  conditions for smooth formulation and implementation of  supporting financial reform measures in 1994.    At the press conference of the National People's Congress  and  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on March  17, Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of  China, introduced the main points of financial reform in 1994.  Major points of his introduction are as follows:    Establishing a central bank macroregulation and control  system under the leadership of the State Council that will  independently implement the monetary policies;    Establishing a financial organizations network in which  policy related finance is separated from commercial finance, and  under which state-owned commercial banks are the main body,  while various financial institutions coexist;    Establishing a market system featuring openness, orderly  competition and strict management;    Turning the People's Bank of China into an actual central  bank and specialized banks into the real commercial banks;    Further opening up finance to the outside world, and  unifying  the exchange rate so the Renminbi can gradually become a  convertible currency.    Macroregulation and Central Bank Control    Since it became the central bank in 1984, the People's Bank  of China has carried out independent monetary policies. It has  employed international practices such as reserve deposits,  rediscounts, interest rates, central bank loans and credit  limits to control the money supply and adjust the credit  structure.    Major function of the central bank Vice-President  Zhou Zhengqing pointed out at the branch head conference of the  People's Bank of China held in December last year that a real  central bank should lead and manage national financial  undertakings, scientifically devise and carry out monetary  policies and maintain essential currency stability; and exert  strict supervision and administration over financial organs and  ensure secure and effective operation of the financial system.  ""Only the head office of the People's Bank of China has the  right to create monetary policies,"" Zhou emphasized.    Specific Reform Measures Zhou said major reform  measures include the following:    -- Transforming and defining functions of the People's Bank  of China. The head office of the People's Bank of China has the  rights to issue money, manage basic monetary policies, regulate  and control total credit, and regiment bench mark interest  rates, in order to guarantee the face of monetary policies  throughout the country. Usually, the head office of the People's  Bank of China only allows provision of temporary credit to head  offices of national commercial banks. The basic duties of the  bank's branches include: financial supervision and management  investigation and statistical analysis, adjustment of horizontal  money supply, state treasury operation, cash allocation,  exchange management and interbank settlement    -- Reforming and improving monetary policies. The ultimate  goal of the monetary policy of the People's Bank of China is to  maintain currency stability and thus promote economic growth.  In line with the macroeconomic situation, it will flexibly use  monetary policy tools such as legal deposit reserve rates,  central bank loans, rediscounts, interest rates, open-market  operations, central bank foreign exchange operations and credit  lines to regulate and control the money supply. It has started  from this year to handle separately funds and business of  commercial and policy-related banks, cut off the direct  connection between the central bank's basic money supply and  policy-related loans, and to practice asset liability ratio and  asset risk in managing the Renminbi and foreign currency credit  in commercial banks.    -- Fortifying the supervision and management of the central  bank over the national banking industry. Drafts of the Law of  the People's Bank of China, the Bank Law of the People's  Republic of China, the Law of Negotiable Instruments and the Law  of Insurance will be submitted to the National People's Congress  for examination and approval in 1994. In the interim, rules and  regulations managing various financial institutions will be  drawn up and refined. According to Zhu Xiaohua, vice president  of the People's Bank of China, China will soon make up and  enforce 22 laws, regulations and methods relating to the banking  industry. The drafting has absorbed some common articles from  foreign bank laws and related regulations under the market  economy. Starting from the reality of China, these statutes  will be made similar to international practice so the Chinese  financial market can be linked with global financial circles.    Financial lnstitutions    Within the financial institutions network, policy-related  finance should be separated from commercial finance. With the  state-owned commercial banks as the main body, the network  should accommodate financial institutions of various kinds.    Policy-related banks: Beginning from the second  half of 1993, three policy-related banks were founded and  formally put into operation in 1994. They are the State  Development Bank that accommodates funds for key state  construction projects; the Agricultural Development Bank that  provides policy-related loans for the country's reserves of  grain, cotton and edible oil, contracted purchase of farm and  sideline products, and agricultural development; and the Bank of  Import and Export Credit.    Policy-related banks are geared to the needs of state  policies and do not aim at making profits. They provide special  loans that are beneficial to overall stability, such as specific  loans for infrastructure construction, stocks of key materials,  and poverty aid and disaster relief. Their interest rates are  much lower than those of the market.    Policy-related banks do not participate in commercial  banking  competition but receive the supervision of the central bank.    Conventionally, policy-related banks do not absorb social  deposits. Therefore, they have no direct debt relationship with  the public. The main sources of funds come from financial  allocation, central bank reloans, bonds issued to the public,  regular sums left in social security funds, and indirect use of  post office deposits.    In establishing the policy-related banks, China has drawn on  foreign experience as a reference, especially that of the United  States and Japan. Still in their preliminary stages, China's  policy-related banks are not as detailed in function as their  foreign counterparts.    State-owned commercial banks: As policy-related  banks take over policy-related financial business, the existing  state-owned specialized banks (including the Industrial and  Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the  Bank of China and the People's Construction Bank of China) will  be transformed into state-owned commercial banks. They will  operate with the mechanisms of modern commercial banks, featured  by autonomous management and assumption of full responsibility  for profits and losses.    State-owned commercial banks, though rivals, can undertake  interlocked business. All their operations must strictly abide  by the Bank Law of the People's Republic of China and other  financial rules and regulations. They must receive the  supervision of the central bank.    Other financial institutions: In addition to the  People's Bank of China and the above-mentioned four state-owned  specialized banks, China's financial institutions include nine  commercial banks such as the Bank of Communications, 12  insurance companies, 387 financial trust and investment firms,  87 securities bodies, 29 financial houses, 11 financial and  leasing concerns, 59,000 rural credit cooperatives and 3,900  urban credit cooperatives. All these constitute the Chinese  financial network.    All commercial banks and other non-bank financial  institutions will operate in line with the Bank Law of the  People's Republic of China and other related financial rules and  regulations.    In this financial reform, rural and urban credit  cooperatives  will change into rural and urban cooperative banks, whose major  task is to develop the local economy and provide services to  small and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture, animal  husbandry and the fishing industry.    Financial Market System    Diversification of credit forms and financial tools have  boosted the development of China's financial market. In 1986,  fund markets were established in the five cities of Shenyang,  Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Changzhou. Over the following  several years, various kinds of financial markets were  established across the country. They included inter-bank, short  and long-term funds, corporate bond, national debt, note  discount, foreign exchange swap and stock markets. This  resulted in floating interest rates and commodity capital.    In 1993, China successfully set up its first-class national  debt dealer system. This symbolized the move by China's  national debt market toward standardization and international  practice. From this year on, the Ministry of Finance stops  borrowing from the People's Bank to amend the financial budget,  and therefore, the financial deficit shall be met through the  issue of national debt. During his visit to Japan in early  March, President Zhu Rongji said that China, in order to control  inflation, will adopt tight currency and strict financial  policies to control money issuing and expenditure. Specifically  speaking, China will issue national debt to replace its previous  practice of meeting deficit by borrowing money from banks and by  money issue. This is a significant reform. This year, the  proportion of national debt in the financial budget in China is  about the same as that in Japan.    Another major measure in this year's financial reform is the  unification of the exchange rate. The unitary floating exchange  rate based on the exchange market price was put into effect from  January 1. Coinciding with global practice, this move will have  far-reaching significance on Sino-foreign economic exchange. It  will help attract foreign investment and pave the way for China  to restore its status in GATT. In addition, it opens a path for  the free convertibility of the Renminbi, the ultimate goal of  the reform of the exchange management system.    Experts say that only when China has sufficient exchange  reserves, Chinese commodities occupy a significant share in the  world market, Chinese enterprises are internationally  competitive enough, and Chinese legal conditions improve, can  the Renminbi's free convertibility finally materialize.

0,FT931-7586 ,"FT931-7586 _AN-DBXCKAAWFT 930224   FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan Responds to Downturn: Japan holds its breath as the economy sinks      By CHARLES LEADBEATER      TOKYO   JAPAN IS facing one of the most comprehensive, complex and severe economic crises since the end of the second world war. The sharp fall in land, property and share prices from the heyday of the speculative bubble economy between 1987 and 1989, has led to a steep fall in private demand. Manufacturers overinvested and overproduced in the late 1980s. In cars and electronics especially, they have been carrying huge stocks of idle machines and unsold products. Consumer demand for them appears to be saturated. The population's propensity to consume is falling as people's anxiety about the outlook leads them to build up precautionary savings. The financial sector is hobbled by mounting bad debts at the banks, a prolonged slump in share prices and very low trading volumes on the stock market, which is punishing the profits of securities houses. Without a healthy financial sector, the economy will find it difficult to generate the credit needed to finance recovery. Japan's much vaunted industrial companies let their personnel and investment costs grow rapidly in the 1980s, an increase disguised at the time by the very low cost of raising capital. As Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, put it yesterday, the rapid economic expansion at the end of the decade merely delayed the need for Japanese companies to cut costs in line with slower growth. This combination of pressures has left the economy in a vulnerable and volatile state. The stock market is drifting listlessly around the 16,800 level, open to a further sharp fall as companies revise profits down before the end of the financial year at the end of next month. The sudden appreciation of the yen against the dollar in the past two weeks has hit exporters. The growth in the trade surplus fuels worries about a resurgence of trade friction with the US. Many companies are waiting to see whether the economy can recover. They are holding fire on plans to cut their payrolls and restructure some of the international operations they acquired at great cost in the 1980s. The electronics company JVC signalled at the weekend what might be in store by announcing plans to close subsidiaries in the Netherlands and Germany. Companies may not have to wait for long. The forces behind the downturn will come to a head in the next few months. Things may well get worse before they get better. The response of Japan's politicians, bureaucrats and executives will determine whether the economy slumps into a prolonged period of very slow growth or whether it can stage a modest recovery from the end of the year. They will have to confront some of the most powerful taboos of Japanese economic and corporate life to rescue the economy. Fiscal policy - public spending and tax cuts - will be vital to compensate for the fall in consumer spending. But income tax cuts will require higher government borrowing, turning back the hard won consolidation of public finances during the 1980s. The Liberal Democratic party will have to assert itself over the Finance Ministry which rules budgetary policy. The party's leaders will have to face up to their seniors, still influential older leaders such as former prime ministers Nakasone and Fukuda who oppose higher borrowing. The hard-pressed banks will come under increasing pressure from the Bank of Japan to deal with their bad debts. Many would make sharply lower profits if they had to write off non-performing assets. Some would be forced into losses. No Japanese bank has made a loss since the end of the last war. Industrial companies are just embarking on a long retrenchment, which will force them to amend some of their traditional values and practices. At companies such as Matsushita in electronics and Bridgestone, the tyre maker, this has already involved dramatic changes in senior management. More companies in cars, steel and electronics are likely to follow Nissan's plan to reduce its workforce by almost 10 per cent in the next few years. Sanyo, the electronics group, is not alone in decentralising to give its divisions more autonomy. Everywhere, Japanese companies say that after three years of declining profits, the imperative is to improve profitability rather than the traditional goal of expanding market share. Japanese policymakers and companies are well known for their long-termism, their strategic approach to investment and their patience over earning returns upon it. The reality is that the creativity of the Japanese economy has been largely the product of crisis - from the occupation after the second world war to the oil shocks of the 1970s and the high yen recession of the mid-1980s.

Mr Raymond, who is 54 and first joined Exxon as a production research engineer in 1963, will in turn be succeeded as president by Mr Charles Sitter, a senior vice-president and director of Exxon. The retirement of Mr Rawl, to take effect on April 28, the date of Exxon's annual shareholders' meeting, may indicate a change of style at the top of the big US oil and gas company. Mr Rawl is best known in the US as the Exxon leader who was harshly criticised by the media in 1989 for his attitude to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, one of the worst US environmental disasters. Mr Raymond, also a director of J. P. Morgan, the blue-chip New York bank, has held a wide variety of positions at Exxon and is active at the Council on Foreign Relations. In the 1960s and 1970s, he worked at Exxon's US company and was later responsible for Exxon's international supply and transportation of petroleum products and crude oil and for running former Exxon affiliates in Aruba and Venezuela. Between 1979 and 1981, Mr Raymond was president of Exxon Nuclear Company. He later presided over Exxon's operations in the Caribbean, central and South America, becoming president of the Exxon group in 1987. Mr Sitter, who is 62, is responsible for Exxon's chemical business as well as the treasury and tax functions of the group.   Companies:-  Exxon Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  USA.

In fact, the 225-issue Nikkei average ignored Friday's after-hours' fall of nearly 1 per cent in the ISE/Nikkei 50 index in London; hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate prompted arbitrage-linked buying and the Nikkei gained 156.32 at 20,901.49. The Nikkei registered a day's low of 20,548.85 just after the opening, but selling ran its course during the morning session. A rise in the fut-ures market on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange triggered arbitrage buying, pushing the index forward to register a day's high of 20,904.69 in the late afternoon. Volume contracted to 230m shares from 482m. Aside from arbitrageurs, investment trusts and dealers were seen buying in small lots. Advances outnumbered declines by 550 to 396, with 209 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks finished 4.96 ahead at a 1993 peak of 1,688.04, and London's ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 1.83 to 1,286.26. Investors were calm over the revelations of Cosmo Securities' losses of Y69.8bn resulting from its involvement in tobashi, the shuffling of investors' accounts in order to hide unrealised losses. Daiwa Bank said last Friday that it will rescue Cosmo by injecting Y70bn to Y80bn through a third party share allotment. The yen's rise to a further record high worried some investors as the dollar closed Y1.15 down at Y101.25. However, the Bank of Japan's money market operations fuelled speculation of an early discount rate cut. Mr Geoffrey Barker, an economist at Baring Securities, pointed out that five out of six discount rate cuts since 1991 were preceded by generous infusions of funds by the central bank into the money markets. Brokers were hit by the Cosmo debacle. Nomura Securities slipped Y20 to Y2,200, second tier brokers such as Sanyo Securities lost Y25 to Y720 and New Japan Securities declined Y19 to Y694. Trading in Cosmo Securities was suspended for the day. The higher yen supported oil refiners. Koa Oil jumped Y109 to Y1,030 and Mitsubishi Oil gained Y10 at Y1,080. However, export-oriented consumer electronics makers lost ground, with Matsushita Electric Industrial easing Y10 to Y1,360 and Sony Y10 to Y4,370. In Osaka, the OSE average appreciated 27.19 to 22,772.20 in volume of 20.4m shares. Dealer buying supported retail and machinery shares. However, Nintendo, the video game maker, retreated Y190 to Y9,410 on the higher yen. Roundup MORE NEW highs were recorded on the Pacific Rim, while South Korean equities rebounded after last week's losses. SEOUL, which fell 4.5 per cent last Friday and another 3.9 per cent on Saturday after the government ban on trading under false or borrowed names, recovered 25 points, or 3.7 per cent, to 691.67. Turnover expanded to Won399m from the Won271.3m seen in Saturday's half-day session. There were rumours that the government would announce measures to revive the market. But a Finance Ministry official said later that a meeting of economic ministers to discuss a bail-out would make no announcement yesterday. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index rose 97.24, or 1.3 per cent, to a new high of 7,489.49, aided by selective buying from overseas. Turnover was HKDollars 4.66bn, up from Friday's HKDollars 4.49bn. There was more confidence about Chinese economic prospects, and buyers were also encouraged by the strong performance of Stone Electronic, the Hong Kong arm of a collectively owned Chinese company, which ended at HKDollars 2.625 in its trading debut, against its offer price of HKDollars 1.26. SINGAPORE saw strong gains in selected blue chips as the Straits Times Industrial index climbed 5.02 to a record 1,922.89. Singapore Press local shares rose 50 cents to SDollars 12.60 in volume of 204,000 shares. Total turnover was 115.4m shares, after Friday's 137.5m. KUALA LUMPUR balanced profit-taking against impressive results from Malayan Banking, up 20 cents at MDollars 14.70. The KLSE composite index closed just 0.85 higher at 772.76. AUSTRALIA held up well in advance of today's budget, the All Ordinaries index rising 14.8 to 1,870.7 in turnover of ADollars 293.1m on gains in some blue chips and a slight recovery in golds. News Corp forged ahead 23 cents to ADollars 9.13 and offset a heavy fall in CSR, which lost 36 cents to ADollars 3.82 in early trade on adverse newspaper reports about its US asbestos court case, but recovered slightly to close at ADollars 3.96. JAKARTA, closed today for Indonesia's Independence Day holiday, featured strong gains by several banks in active trading, speculating on the prospect of good half-year results as the JKSE index ended 2.07 firmer at 382.01. BII advanced Rp400 to Rp5,000 and Bank Duta Rp325 to Rp3,250, while Bank Danamon, Lippobank and Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia also strengthened. BANGKOK saw a sheaf of weak second-quarter corporate earnings reports. Investors sold near the end of the day and the SET index shed 10.33 to 954.29 in Bt6.27bn turnover.

0,FT911-284 ,"FT911-284 _AN-BEMAUACVFT 910513   FT  13 MAY 91 / Fabian call for overhaul of regulation      By CHARLES LEADBEATER, Industrial Editor   THE SYSTEM for regulating utilities should be radically overhauled, with commissions introduced to hold open hearings on the utilities' plans, according to a Fabian Society paper published today. The society, a left-of-centre think tank, argues that US-style regulatory commissions should be created to oversee the water, gas and electricity industries. At the open hearings consumers and other interested parties could give evidence. The commissions would be much more open than the current regulatory offices Ofwat, Ofgas and Offer. The study, by Professor Michael Waterson of Reading University, argues that commissions holding open hearings would be more appropriate for water, gas and electricity because there are limited prospects for introducing competition there. He argues that forms of regulation should be tailored to the characteristics of the industries concerned, however. So in industries such as telecommunications, where technological change is opening opportunities for competition, the current body, Oftel, is perfectly adequate. Prof Waterson acknowledges that public commissions can be much more expensive than regulatory offices. He says the latter system might be usefully extended to organisations such as the Post Office and British Rail, which are becoming more commercial.

The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee says in a letter to environment minister Mr Tim Yeo that the Thorp reprocessing plant, which is waiting for a licence to start operation, could be responsible for a fifth of this total. The letter, dated November 5, has been leaked to Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group. The letter emphasises that the projection covers tens of thousands of years, and that individual deaths cannot be predicted. It says the dose to the world's population from the discharges is tiny - only 0.03 per cent of the dose from background radiation. The significance of the letter is that it partly supports Greenpeace's claim that radioactive discharges from Sellafield will cause deaths - but also that it describes Greenpeace's use of such statistics as 'misleading'. Greenpeace's claim of an increase in deaths has been part of its campaign against the Thorp plant. A government decision on whether to license the Pounds 2.8bn plant, which has taken 10 years to build, is expected imminently. The environment department said yesterday: 'We asked RWMAC for their opinion and their views will be taken into account.' UK Nirex, the government's Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive, which has been given the task of finding a site to store nuclear waste, said yesterday that it would apply early next year for planning permission for a deep underground laboratory near Sellafield. The laboratory would explore whether a store could be built safely in the rocks at that site. Letters, Page 22   Companies:-  British Nuclear Fuels.     UK Nirex.

0,FT944-3759 ,"FT944-3759 _AN-ELMDEABZFT 941212   FT  12 DEC 94 / Peace primes Irish trade links: John Murray Brown on the potential for cross-border business      By JOHN MURRAY BROWN   In Belfast you can barely find a free parking space for all the cars from the Irish Republic, bearing their distinctive blue plates. In the wake of the paramilitary ceasefires the city is buzzing with Christmas shoppers - and some shopkeepers are even willing to accept Irish punts. Economists expect a boom in cross-border economic activity if the peace process holds. The potential is considerable. Two-way trade was about Pounds 1.2bn in 1992, with Northern Ireland incurring a deficit of Pounds 357m. Mr Paul Gorecki, of the Northern Ireland Economic Council, an independent advisory body set up by the government, says it would be wrong to exaggerate the differences between the north and south. He said: 'We're not dealing with East and West Germany or even the US and Canada.' Both have high unem-ployment, a high birth rate, a shrinking manufacturing base and an overdependence on exchequer funding, whether from the Treasury in Northern Ireland's case or European Union funds in the repub-lic's. Already Northern Ireland Electricity, the privatised utility, is to restore the north-south interconnector with the Electricity Supply Board. It was blown up by the IRA in the early 1970s. This will create savings for the consumer and provide both companies with trading opportunities. British Telecommunications is understood to be interested in opportunities arising from the privatisation of Telecom Eireann. Private companies are also refocusing on an all-Ireland strategy to maximise efficiencies. Takeover activity in areas such as food retailing will spur the process. There are difficulties, however. One is a lack of shared information on cross-border trade. Companies also face poor roads and telecommunications. Other problems are those associated with any foreign investment - the adverse currency risk and the difficulties in pursuing payment in a foreign jurisdiction. Historically the two economies grew apart at partition in the 1920s. Heavy industry such as shipbuilding, and the manufacturing sectors such as linen, brewing and distilling located in the north. The southern economy remained dependent on sales of farm products and commodities and over-reliant on the UK for much of its exports. The real constraint is political. The joint framework document which both governments hope will form the basis for a constitutional settlement for Ulster envisages greater cross-border economic links. Unionists are concerned, however, that this could be the nationalists' Trojan horse for their ultimate goal of a united Ireland. Investment is particularly contentious because it would involve the respective government agencies - Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board and the republic's Industrial Development Agency. Mr Kieran McGowan, managing director of the IDA, said joint tourism initiatives and trade missions would benefit both agencies. He said: 'But with IDB we are competitors. We would talk about the issues that any competitors would talk about. If the ceasefire holds, that competition will intensify.' The strategies of the two agencies differ markedly - the republic relying on a 10 per cent corporate tax and the IDB enticing investors with big capital grants. So far much of the foreign investment on both sides of the border has been what Mr Gorecki at NIEC calls 'stand alone - easy entrance and easy exit'. The challenge for authorities north and south is to persuade existing and new investors to deepen their roots in the community, through more local sourcing and research links with local universities, and sharing subcontractors on both sides of the border. The private sector is setting the pace. Ulster Bank has an extensive network in the south - in small towns such as Killarney its branch offices display the logo in Gaelic. Monaghan Mushrooms in the republic, which accounts for 25 per cent of the UK fresh mushroom market, is one of a cluster of food companies near the border with Northern Ireland. Monaghan provides compost to small farmers on both sides of the border, buying back the mushrooms. The operation also provides pizza toppings for Heinz's Dundalk factory in the republic. Heinz's decision to locate in Dundalk was to take advantage of IDA incentives, and the proximity to the Larne port in Northern Ireland. Fruit of the Loom, the US clothing manufacturer, also operates on both sides of the border. Mr Gorecki believes with the peace in place, the first question will be whether the IDB can continue with its generous grants. This will depend on the IDA's strategy. Currently, the 10 per cent tax incentive in the republic is assured until the year 2010.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     IEZ  Ireland, EC.

0,FT943-8569 ,"FT943-8569 _AN-EHRD3AGAFT 940816   FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan computer products boosted      By LAURA TYSON      TAIPEI   The strength of the yen has spurred Taiwan's exports of computer-related products to Japan, but not enough to turn around the latter's bilateral trade surplus. Taiwan's exports to Japan of information products, including hardware and software, jumped 67.5 per cent in the first half of 1994, compared with a year earlier, according to the Taiwan Industrial Development Bureau. Such exports are expected to surpass Dollars 450m for the year, against Dollars 232m last year. The Taiwan dollar has fallen by nearly a quarter against the yen in the last year. The bureau predicts Taiwan-made information products will make up 17 per cent of Japan's computer market by the end of the year. Japanese demand was boosted by increased demand for DOS software, which Taiwan produces relatively cheaply, as it is one of the main producers of IBM-compatible personal computers. DOS programs are the basic operating software for IBM-type PCs. However, Taiwan's computer industry remains heavily reliant on expensive high-technology imports, mainly from Japan. Key components including the liquid crystal display for computer monitors, hard disk drives, and more advanced memory chips are bought from Japan. Imported components make up roughly half the production cost of a personal computer made in Taiwan. That figure contributes to Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan, which was Dollars 14.42bn in 1993 and is forecast to top Dollars 16bn this year. Taiwan ranked fifth in output of computer hardware products after the US, Japan, the UK and Singapore in 1993, according to government figures. Revenues for the information sector (hardware, software and services) climbed 15.5 per cent to Dollars 10.8bn, of which Dollars 1.1bn was generated from software and services.

The deficit is now put at up to Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.64bn), against Dollars 1.5bn before, according to planning secretary Juan Llach. At the same time, unemployment and under-employment in October rose to 7 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively, against 6 and 7.9 per cent a year earlier, the Indec statistics agency said. Independent researchers at the UADE business school reported that workers' purchasing power fell 8 per cent in December. Mr Pedro Lacoste, an economic consultant, blames rapid economic change for the apparent contradiction of a rising trade deficit and increasing unemployment. Unreliable statistics worsen the confusion, he says. He believes the employment data reflect a heavy shakeout in industry, as companies struggle to boost productivity, and he expects inflation and the trade deficit to fall sharply this year. However, Mr Jose Luis Machinea, chief economist at the Union Industrial Argentina, an employers' grouping, says the trade figures reflect low productivity. 'Productivity growth has to be based on investments, but this takes time. It will take four to five years to close our 15-20 per cent productivity gap.' Mr Machinea says the doubt is over how the ensuing trade deficit will be financed and whether industry will invest sufficiently. He warns that imports are replacing domestic production, while investment is insufficient and is directed at service sectors, which do not generate hard currency. The government, though, insists all is well. The Planning Secretariat says the trade deficit may persist this year, but will then fall sharply.

0,FT931-9874 ,"FT931-9874 _AN-DBKB3AFAFT 930211   FT  11 FEB 93 / Technology: CFCs get the cold shoulder      By HAIG SIMONIAN   Italy's Candy white goods group this week unveiled what it says are the world's first mass-produced refrigerators which work without environment-damaging chlorofluorocarbons. The new fridges use HFC 134a, an alternative chemical which is now the front-runner to replace CFCs in refrigerator applications. Unlike CFCs, HFC 134a does not harm the earth's ozone layer. It is in commercial production by ICI and Du Pont. The Candy range, which is being introduced two years ahead of a European Community accord to phase out CFCs by 1995, may soon be followed by other leading manufacturers. A number of European companies are believed to be working on CFC-free fridges, some of which may be unveiled at next week's big Domotechnica consumer durables trade fair in Cologne. Although the new range does not include CFC refrigerant, it is still only a half-way house as far as the use of chemicals for insulation is concerned. For their insulating material the Candy fridges use HCFC 141b gas, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon which Candy admits is 'a transitory solution'. Although the chemical dissipates in the atmosphere 10 times faster than CFCs, researchers are still working on an environmentally harmless solution for insulation use. Silvano Fumagalli, chairman of Candy's main operating company, said the group, like other big white goods makers, was looking into the use of cyclopentane as an alternative. Experimental fridges using cyclopentane are already believed to have been tested. However, the gas is dangerous to handle and foam produced from it is a less effective insulator than that from HCFC 141b. Fumagalli said Candy was working closely with chemical companies in the search for suitable alternatives. The new Candy fridges already marked a step forward in eliminating CFCs without compromising operating standards, he said.   Companies:-  Candy.   Countries:-  ItZaly, EC.

The move is part of the strategy of Mr Pat Rich, BOC chairman, to expand in continental Europe and South America. BOC's shares closed down 2p at 657p. The business includes the longest hydrogen pipeline in Europe, extending more than 210km through the Rhine-Ruhr area and serving customers in both oil refining and chemicals. It also includes a cylinder and trailer filling station for hydrogen, methane and ethylene at Marl, near Munster. Financial details were not provided. However, BOC said the consideration would be less than Pounds 78m. It is understood the sum is greater than Pounds 50m. The amount should be settled in cash on completion, expected in mid-July. The deal has the agreement of the German competition authorities. BOC said the business should make a positive contribution to earnings within a year as demand for hydrogen was robust and continued to grow. The company expects long-term demand growth to average at about 5 per cent a year. BOC said the business would make a substantial addition to its continental operations whose turnover last year was about Pounds 140m. Group turnover was about Pounds 2.8bn. Huls will continue to manufacture hydrogen for BOC and operate the filling station. No redundancies at Huls are involved. Goldman Sachs advised the German company. Mr Chung Kong Chow, BOC Gases' chief executive, said: 'This acquisition is a unique opportunity to broaden our product range in a major industrial gas market. It will complement our existing gases business in continental Europe and is a significant step in the expansion of our hydrogen business around the world.'   Companies:-  BOC Group.     Huls.

Mr Raymond, who is 54 and first joined Exxon as a production research engineer in 1963, will in turn be succeeded as president by Mr Charles Sitter, a senior vice-president and director of Exxon. The retirement of Mr Rawl, to take effect on April 28, the date of Exxon's annual shareholders' meeting, may indicate a change of style at the top of the big US oil and gas company. Mr Rawl is best known in the US as the Exxon leader who was harshly criticised by the media in 1989 for what was considered his arrogant, and even nonchalant, attitude to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, one of the worst US environmental disasters. Mr Raymond, who is also a director of J. P. Morgan, the blue-chip New York bank, has held a wide variety of positions at Exxon and is active at the Council on Foreign Relations. In the 1960s and 1970s, he worked at Exxon's US company and was later responsible for Exxon's international supply and transportation of petroleum products and crude oil and for running former Exxon affiliates in Aruba and Venezuela. Between 1979 and 1981, Mr Raymond was president of Exxon Nuclear Company. He later presided over Exxon's operations in the Caribbean, central and South America, becoming president of the Exxon group in 1987. Mr Sitter, who is 62, is responsible for Exxon's chemical business as well as the treasury and tax functions of the group.   Companies:-  Exxon Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  USA.

This follows agreement by important Tamsa shareholders to set up a trust of 20m shares in which the Argentine company will have majority interest. Tamsa's shareholders voted to let Siderca's international division buy shares not taken up in a Dollars 75m Tamsa rights issue. The two moves should enable Siderca to take operating control of Tamsa, although the Mexican steel tube company will continue to maintain its separate identity. The deal underscores Siderca's ambitions to consolidate its share of the international steel tube market. Siderca recently reached agreement with Confab of Sao Paulo, Brazil to swap 30 per cent of each other's shares. Siderca is Argentina's largest private exporter, with annual production of seamless steel tubing of about 750,000 tonnes a year, most of which is exported to more than 50 countries. Tamsa, which had sales last year of 919m new pesos (Dollars 296m), has suffered recently from strong international competition. It has also been affected by the restructuring of Petoleos Mexicanos, its main client. The Tamsa rights issue is 6-for-25 at Dollars 5.54 per share. Tamsa is listed on the New York stock exchange. Siderca will have the right to buy up those shares not subscribed to. The issue had been opposed by the State of Wisconsin investment board, which has a 7 per cent holding in Tamsa. Alfa, the Mexican industrial conglomerate, is set to launch an initial public offering of 15 per cent of the capital of its steel subsidiary Hyslamex. The offering is expected to raise Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m.   Companies:-  Siderca Saic.     Tubos de Acero de Mexico.     Grupo Industrial Alfa.     Hyslamex.   Countries:-  MXZ  Mexico.

0,FT944-17883 ,"FT944-17883 _AN-EJFD1AB9FT 941006   FT  06 OCT 94 / Industrial tribunal results 'improve'      By DAVID GOODHART   The industrial tribunal system appears to have substantially improved its productivity, in spite of government concern that it is becoming overloaded. An analysis in the latest Employment Gazette shows that 30 per cent more cases were cleared in 1993-94 than in the previousa year. More than 110,000 cases were heard by a tribunal, handled by the conciliation service Acas or withdrawn, compared with about 85,000 in 1992-93. The tribunals disposed of 69,612 cases compared with 53,445 in the previous year. That included a substantial increase in unfair dismissal cases from 33,683 to 42,757. The government is still expected to press ahead with a consultative paper on reform of the industrial tribunal system. The paper, expected next month or early next year, is likely to concentrate on making the system more efficient and on holding back its rising costs. Some employers' organisations are critical of the narrow focus government consultation is likely to take. Mr Peter Martin, a legal expert at the Engineering Employers Federation, said: 'We are concerned that the whole thing will be too narrow and will not look at issues like simplifying the law.' The Employment Gazette study and a separate analysis of unfair dismissal cases showed: About two-thirds of cases dealt with by industrial tribunals in 1993-94 did not reach a tribunal hearing because they were resolved through Acas conciliation or settled privately. The distribution, hotels, catering and repairs sector remained the biggest source of unfair dismissal cases, although its share in the total was falling.
