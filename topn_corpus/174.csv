The bombing of the New York WTC may have connections to  Denmark. The Arhus police four months ago arrested three  Egyptians and charged them with attempted arson and purchasing  chemicals for fabricating bombs. [see item 94WT0004B in 7  January Terrorism Report] In searching their residence, the  police found telephone lists with names and addresses of some of  those charged with attempted murder in the United States.    ""Therefore, we asked the FBI for help in clearing up our  case. FBI colleagues have been in Denmark, and we have developed  information. We don't know, however, whether those being held in  this country have any concrete connection with the attempted  murder case itself,"" said Arhus Deputy Police Chief Villy  Sorensen.    ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE yesterday wrote that a fingerprint of  one  of those jailed in the Arhus case is on an ""object"" found in  connection with the follow-up investigation of the New York  bombing incident.    ""I won't comment on this,"" said Sorensen. He confirmed,  however, that those being held in Arhus and those charged in the  U.S. bombing attack are members of the same Islamic  fundamentalist organization.    According to the deputy police chief, there is nothing to  indicate that the individuals being held in Arhus were in New  York when the bomb exploded in the WTC basement.    Nor have U.S. authorities requested that the jailed  individuals be handed over for prosecution in the United States.    Two of those charged in Arhus -- ages 30 and 36 -- are  asylum-seekers, while the third, a 41-year-old man, has  permanent residence in Denmark after having lived here for 10  years. The two asylum-seekers have told Danish authorities they  are applying for asylum in Denmark because they are being sought  in Egypt.     "

The campaign is starting to face strong resistance by  some of the elements of these groups, who are using firearms.  This unprecedented phenomenon signals an increase in the  violence of these groups.    We have learned that the latest arrests have been  concentrated in al-Rusayfah and al-Zarqa' towns and the 'Awjan  area for the past two weeks. Officers and men, assisted by  personnel from the special police force, carried out arrests and  apprehended a great number of people from these groups, which  are believed to have a connection with attempts to plague Jordan  with terrorism.    According to a knowledgeable source, the campaign did not  end  peacefully. One of the suspects fired at a security officer,  wounding him in the leg.    The latest arrests are apparently part of a series of  measures to fight the establishment of terrorist organizations  in the Kingdom financed from abroad. Jordan is taking rather  harsh measures to contain the terrorist groups that have been  formed recently.    AL-BILAD has recently noted a number of attempts on the  world  level, instigated by Israel, as well as other attempts sponsored  by Arab businessmen, to brand Jordan with terrorism and  implicate Amman in a never ending cycle of terror.    We begin in Denmark where big question marks are raised in  connection with a fire at a residence of a Jordanian citizen who  was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and currently resides in  Denmark. According to well-informed sources, the Danish police  arrested three Egyptians following the fire and investigated the  possibility that the suspects are connected to the bombing of  the World Trade Center [WTC]. Two of the arrested men were  political refugees and the third holds Danish citizenship as  well as Egyptian citizenship and currently resides in Denmark.    The three were accused of buying chemicals used to  manufacture explosives similar to those used in the WTC bombing.  The name of the Jordanian citizens, whose house was set on  fire, has not been released. The Danish authorities' arrest of  the three Egyptians is construed as having a link with the fire.  However, the incident created the impression, encouraged by the  United States and Israel, that certain Jordanian nationals are  involved in terrorism.    It goes without saying that for U.S. public opinion, the  most  sensitive act of terrorism is the bombing of the WTC in February  of last year. According to Arab sources, active Israeli  security bodies in Europe are now trying to invent false  connections between Jordanians residing in Europe and Egyptians  suspected of belonging to the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah led by  Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, currently detained in the United  States.    Therefore, Jordan must prepare to confront a media war that  is expected to be launched against it from Washington and  European capitals on terrorism stories similar to the one we  just related.    This war is not isolated from fears by certain Arab sources  that the [Israeli intelligence service] Mosad is perhaps  carrying out assassination attempts against Hamas members in  Jordan. The aim is to create confusion in Jordan and disturb  the security of the country and create a new climate of  terrorist acts.    In short, Israel is endeavoring to drown Jordan in the  maelstrom of terrorism and extremism in two ways: the first is  by giving international public opinion the impression that the  Jordanians have some sort of connection with acts of terrorism  in Europe and the United States; and second, by threatening to  carry out terrorist acts in Jordan itself and disturb the stable  security conditions in the country.    Meanwhile, secret attempts by Arabs have also been revealed  aimed at drowning Jordan in acts of terrorism by financing  groups returning from Afghanistan.    As has already been mentioned, the first Arab involved in  financing terror in Jordan was the Saudi businessman Usamah Bin-  Ladin. Jordanian security investigations have already revealed  that one of the leaders of the Jordanian Afghans, Zakariya  Muhammad Dawud, traveled to Sanaa and met with Yemeni figures  representing the financier, Bin-Ladin, who helped him join  training camps.    Bin-Ladin finances large training camps of Arab Afghans,  including quite a large number of Jordanians, in Sanaa with the  aim of exporting terror to Jordan.    Jordan is exerting immense efforts to apprehend a Saudi  merchant and arms smuggler by the name of Nasir Mashhur  al-Ruwayli. Al-Ruwayli is considered one of the most dangerous  drug traffickers and gun smugglers across Arab borders. He uses  drug smuggling in striking arms deals and smuggling these arms  to Arab states.    It is feared that this smuggler was involved in supplying  weapons to extremist groups to carry out terrorist acts.  Members of these groups in Jordan were arrested recently.

0,FT931-4556 ,"FT931-4556 _AN-DCJCTAGJFT 930310   FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bomb teaches NY exchanges the value of co-operation      By LAURIE MORSE      CHICAGO   ROUGH ESTIMATES of the cost of keeping New York's five commodities exchanges operating during the week after the World Trade Center bomb blast fall near Dollars 1m, with most of the money spent on emergency services such as fire patrols and auxiliary cooling equipment. The cost, exchange executives say, has been minor, compared with the importance of keeping the markets open. The exchanges include the New York Mercantile Exchange, where most of the world's oil is priced, the New York Commodity Exchange, an important metals market, the New York Cotton Exchange, the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, and the tiny New York Futures Exchange, a subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange. These markets provide worldwide price quotes for a variety of strategic commodities. 'We had to stay open,' says Mr Lou Guttman, the Nymex chairman. 'There was a lot of money riding on this. If we had closed down for two weeks, I would have had to tell a lot of guys to go home and not come back. There wouldn't have been a market to come back to.' At the exchanges, which share a trading floor in a WTC building not directly hit by the blast, the week following the bombing was marked by severe problems. Traders and support staff laboured without heat or air conditioning amid repeated crank bomb threats and the overhanging threat of power loss. Technicians at one point brought in dry ice to cool exchange computers; and the Nymex and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange worked out a pact for emergency price reporting, in case Nymex's tickers failed. Despite the difficulties, traders managed to squeeze a lot of business into half-day sessions. Volume at the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange was actually higher than in the same week in 1992, and the giant Nymex traded only about 20 per cent fewer contracts. Volumes at the Comex and the Cotton Exchange were down about 40 per cent for the week, and the Nyfe turned about 15 per cent fewer trades. This week, air conditioning has been restored and most trading hours have returned to normal, with the exception of earlier closings for the Nymex and a half-session for Comex's Eurotop 100 futures. The atmosphere at the Commodity Exchange Center is far from normal, however. Nymex oil traders, reminded of their vulnerability to terrorism, have sought additional security. Bomb-sniffing dogs now roam the trading floor, armed guards patrol the lobbies and packages are examined by airport-style x-ray machines. The crisis, it seems, brought an unexpected benefit: exchange executives say it forced co-operation between the five normally fractious exchanges. 'We were actually working together,' said the Nymex's Mr Guttman. The bombing has also set off a scramble for 'shadow' trading floors. The Nyfe is refitting its old space at the New York Stock Exchange for emergencies and Nymex, which plans to move to new quarters in Manhattan in the second quarter of 1994, may keep its WTC space as a back-up.

Mr David Lee, WTC general manager, said the deal to sell the shopping and office complex in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay district would bring a net profit of about HKDollars 650m. Shareholders have yet to approve the deal. In May, Hongkong Land sold a central district block to a Chinese consortium for HKDollars 3.8bn. Mr Lee said: 'The proceeds will be used to repay debts, finance the company's various projects in China, and for strategic investment in Hong Kong and south-east Asia.' On September 1, the Hong Kong government appointed an inspector to probe the affairs of WTC and Tomson Pacific after a Securities and Futures Commission investigation into certain share deals by the two companies.

The arrests followed the unveiling of the statue by the Queen Mother, who was interrupted and heckled during a speech honouring Sir Arthur and the 55,000 allied Bomber Command aircrew killed in action. Scuffles broke out as protesters standing in a crowd of wartime veterans shouted 'Harris was a mass murderer'. The Queen Mother said that Sir Arthur was 'an inspiring leader' and that the bombing crews had 'given us hope and the means of salvation' during the war. The ceremony sparked protests in several German cities and was condemned by civic leaders in some towns hit by RAF bombers. The German foreign ministry and the mayors of Dresden, Cologne and Pforzheim protested at the memorial. The Queen Mother, patron of the Bomber Command Association which paid for the statue, performed the ceremony at St Clement Danes Church in the Strand.  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "
0,FT931-5315 ,"FT931-5315 _AN-DCGAJAB7FT 930306   FT  06 MAR 93 / Towers of strength at a time of disaster: Three of New York's finest      By NIKKI TAIT and KAREN ZAGOR   Disasters have a knack of catapulting individuals into the limelight - and the blast which rocked New York's World Trade Center complex last week was no exception. Three men have captured both the city's and the nation's attention: Stanley Brezenoff, the burly, 55-year-old executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns and operates the World Trade Center complex; Raymond Kelly, the veteran New York city policeman who became the city's 37th police commissioner in October; and James Fox, head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's New York office. These three spearheaded an emergency response which has been widely viewed as efficient, humane and relatively free of strife between different public agencies. Whether such commendation would have persisted had investigations flagged or further incidents occurred is open to question. In the event, Thursday's arrest of Mohammed Salameh, a Moslem fundamentalist, placated most critics. The division of responsibilities quickly became clear. After an inter-agency meeting at Mayor David Dinkins's offices last Sunday morning, Brezenoff, crumpled and in a cardigan, emerged to handle questions about the safety of the seven-building complex and the tenants' fate. Visitors to New York usually associate the Port Authority with a notoriously sleazy bus terminal on 8th Avenue. Even New Yorkers think of it principally in terms of the PATH (Port Authority Trans Hudson) train system which connects New Jersey with Manhattan. But the PA is a massive agency, with a Dollars 2.7bn annual budget and jurisdiction over the region's airports, tunnels, bridges and harbour operations, as well as five industrial parks and the WTC. Brezenoff himself was on the 67th floor of One World Trade Center, one of the twin towers which dominate Manhattan's skyline, when the blast occurred. He directed staff off the floor and helped carry a wheelchair-bound colleague down dozens of flights of stairs. He reached the ground about five hours after the explosion, by which time the mayor's Office of Emergency Management, which co-ordinates the city's rescue efforts during disasters, had begun to act. Brezenoff went straight to the makeshift command centre set up in the devastated Vista hotel's ballroom. Over the weekend, Brezenoff set up temporary headquarters in a nearby Marriott hotel and helped arrange for New York's futures exchanges, which share a trading floor at Four World Trade Center, to open on Monday. Many of the WTC's largest tenants are big financial firms with other office locations nearby and so able to fend for themselves. For example, Deloitte  Touche, the accountancy firm, which had 1,200 people working on seven floors of one WTC tower, relocated them without the help of the Port Authority. New York state set up a Dollars 5m assistance scheme, providing interest-free loans for small businesses displaced by the disaster. However, Brezenoff has found himself deflecting charges that the Port Authority ignored reports in the mid-1980s and 1991 which highlighted safety flaws at the WTC. Lawsuits were filed within days of the blast, and Brezenoff expects 'these will multiply. We carry property damage and liability insurance which I believe will cover everything for which we may be liable.' Over the longer term, Brezenoff may face a harder task. There is a question mark over future confidence in the centre, particularly if it acquires a reputation as a terrorists' target. By Thursday, the New York Times was reporting that three tenants or potential tenants of the WTC - Rollins Hudig Hall, an insurance company, Bank of America and Fiduciary Trust, an investment bank - were reconsidering leasing space or extending their leases in the downtown location. Brezenoff responded quickly, arranging for Fiduciary Trust's chairman to lead Thursday's daily press briefing with a declaration that the company was concluding negotiations for a second 20-year lease on its offices and had no intention of leaving the WTC. In addition, Brezenoff said the Port Authority signed a new lease within days of the blast for a 7,000 sq ft restaurant in the centre. Public wariness may also have been allayed by the fact that the investigation into the bombing is being handled jointly by the FBI and the New York Police Department's bomb squad, one of the oldest and largest US municipal forces. The NYPD has emerged with its reputation enhanced over the past week, thanks largely to Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. The Irish-American grew up on Manhattan's West Side, once worked as a stock-boy at Macy's department store, and has been with the police department for three decades. Nevertheless, his appointment as commissioner came at a delicate time. Last autumn, police corruption was dominating the local tabloid press, and public confidence in the NYPD was at low ebb. Vocal sections of the police force claimed that their work was being undermined by city officials - in particular, by Mayor Dinkins - who appeared more anxious to support the city's many racial minorities than back the force. The bombing is the first serious incident with which Kelly has had to grapple as commissioner, and it has neatly deflected attention from these thorny local issues. Kelly's public image as no-nonsense and straight-talking has been polished by his daily TV appearances, and for once the city is confronting an event on which public opinion is united. James Fox, the FBI director, has remained a more enigmatic figure. Fox appears in the public eye during times of local crisis - most recently in February when a hijacked Lufthansa jet landed at Kennedy Airport - only to slip back into the shadows once the emergency has passed. In New York, Fox is best known for his comments after mafia boss John Gotti was convicted on murder and racketeering charges in April: 'The Teflon is gone. The don is covered with Velcro, and all the charges stuck.' In spite of the apparent goodwill among the agencies, by yesterday, strains between city and federal law enforcement bodies were starting to show. There were recriminations that news leaks by federal officials had forced a premature arrest of Mr Salameh, and hampered investigations. Nevertheless, co-operation between New York's public agencies this week reflects their cool professionalism under fire and may pave the way for closer relations in future.

At least six other people were detained in different parts of the country. Organising a neo-Nazi or fascist party has been a crime since 1952, but it is the first time legislation, approved last month, to clamp down on racism has been used. The arrests suggest the authorities are taking seriously the threat of organised attacks against immigrants and incitement to racism, especially in the light of developments in Germany. In the past year some 300 actions by right-wing extremists have been reported. Mr Freda recently founded the National Front, which magistrates believe is run from Verona.

US investigators said they planned to place charges for interfering with investigations into the case. New York City police commissioner Raymond Kelly yesterday said more arrests were expected in the case. The second arrest in the case followed Thursday evening's charging of Mr Mohammed Salameh, a Moslem fundamentalist who was arrested as he tried to retrieve Dollars 400 for a rented van alleged to have contained the bomb. Mr Salameh was charged with aiding and abetting the bombing and subsequent fire and with transporting explosives across state lines. If convicted, he could receive a life sentence. Mr Salameh was arrested when he returned to collect a deposit on the van. The rental agreement named him and gave his address. Details of the charge against Mr Salameh pointed to him as the builder of the massive bomb that blasted a 100-ft-wide hole in an underground parking garage at the centre. The complaint said tools and parts were found at an apartment Mr Salameh used and that a police expert said they were evidence of a 'bomb-maker'. US District Judge Richard Owen ordered Mr Salameh to be held without bail. Investigators are still looking for other suspects, and the FBI warned that the investigation would probably continue for many months.

Yesterday FBI agents carried out fresh raids for suspects and clues linked to the bombing, but reports that three men arrested at a mosque yesterday on charges of transporting a stolen car across state lines were linked to the case could not be confirmed. A second suspect was charged yesterday with assaulting an investigator and obstructing justice. Mr Ibrahim Elgabrowny was ordered held without bail. The second arrest in the case followed Thursday evening's charging of Mr Mohammed Salameh, a Moslem fundamentalist who was detained as he tried to retrieve Dollars 400 for a rented van alleged to have contained the bomb. The rental agreement named him and gave his address. Mr Salameh was charged with aiding and abetting the bombing and subsequent fire and with transporting explosives across state lines. He was refused bail. If convicted, he could receive a life sentence. Details of the charge against Mr Salameh pointed to him as the builder of the massive bomb that blasted a 100ft-wide-hole in an underground parking garage at the centre. The complaint said tools and parts were found at an apartment Mr Salameh used and that a police expert said they were evidence of a 'bomb-maker'. US District Judge Richard Owen ordered Mr Salameh to be held without bail. Investigators are still looking for other suspects, and the FBI warned that the investigation would probably continue for many months.

Mr James Fox, head of the FBI's New York office, said five of the men were arrested in a bomb factory in Queens in the middle of mixing a 'witches brew' of ingredients used in other bombings, including New York's World Trade Centre. The FBI would not comment on reports that the accused were planning to assassinate, among others, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and New York Senator Alphonse D'Amato, a Republican who advocates the death penalty for terrorists. The arrests come nearly four months after a bomb exploded at the World Trade Centre, in the worst act of terrorism on US soil. Before the explosion, which killed six people and injured 1,000, the US had been largely free from acts of international terrorism. Those arrested, five of whom are Sudanese resident in the US, are believed to have ties to Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, the blind Egyptian preacher who allegedly inspired the World Trade Centre bombers. The sheikh has condemned the Trade Centre bombing and is appealing against a deportation order from the US. Mr Fox said there was 'no indication of foreign involvement' in the latest plot, and added that the FBI had no plans to arrest the sheikh. An FBI court filing describes a Mr Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali of Jersey City as a central figure in the conspiracy. It alleges that he suggested detonating a car bomb in the UN complex, and that he had taken part in a test explosion before the Trade Centre bombing. The trials of suspects in the World Trade Centre bombing are scheduled to begin in September. The eight arrested yesterday face up to 15 years in jail.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

They called for calm in a nation last week rocked by the suicides of two prominent figures involved in the corruption scandals. The resignation of Mr Angelo Finocchiaro, head of the Sisde intelligence agency, followed three car bomb explosions in Rome and Milan on Tuesday night. Five people were killed. It was not clear whether Mr Finocchiaro's resignation was forced by the Ciampi government. But there has been strong criticism by politicians of the lax control of Italy's security services, and their apparent failure to control terrorism that has killed 10 people in the past two months. Although the precise responsibility for the car bombs remains a mystery, officials said yesterday they had been planned deliberately. The bombs exploded as political parties are about to approve electoral laws that will usher in a largely new political class and at a crucial stage in the investigations into political corruption: leading politicians of the past decade are expected soon to be linked to enormous sums of illicit money. In response to the latest outrage, Italy's trade unions held two-hour stoppages in Rome and Milan yesterday, accompanied by large demonstrations. Pope John Paul II made a point of inspecting the damage at the sites of the two car bombs in Rome - the basilica of St John Lateran and the 12th century church of St George, Velabro. As with the two earlier bomb outrages at Florence's Uffizi Gallery and in a wealthy residential area of Rome in May, the authorities were unable to give clear indications of those responsible. No arrests have been made in the two months since these bombskilled five people in Florence and damaged part of the world-famous picture gallery as well as injuring 23 in Rome. Mr Nicola Mancini, the interior minister, pointed the finger at organised crime. He said there were similarities between Tuesday's bombs and the car bomb that assassinated Mr Paolo Borsellino, the anti-Mafia judge, in Palermo last July, as well as the bombing of the Naples-Milan train in 1984 that killed 15 people. The Borsellino killing was the work of the Sicilian Mafia, while the Naples-Milan train bombing was blamed on a mix of organised crime, right-wing extremists and elements within the security forces. Uncontrolled elements in the security services along with the Mafia, backed by some of the old-guard politicians, are now being accused of orchestrating the car bombs. In the wake of the Uffizi car bombing on May 27, the Ciampi government carried out four changes in the senior hierarchy of the security services. Pressure for a major clean-up of the Sisde has increased in recent weeks following the discovery that a number of top officials, past and present, had expropriated L14bn (Pounds 5.8m) of its funds and had been running a travel agency on the side. The car bombs all exploded during the late evening/early morning. Yesterday, the authorities played down earlier suggestions that firemen had been lured to a burning car in Milan with the bomb then being exploded. Two car bombs were placed beside two ancient religous buildings in Rome - St John Lateran, which once housed the Popes and was where Mussolini signed the 1929 pact with the Church. All three bombs were directed against Italy's cultural/artistic heritage, the Milan explosion being outside the Contemporary Art Museum. The portico of St George, Velabro, was destroyed after recently being restored at a cost of L300m.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.   Industries:-  P9711 National Security.

0,FT932-8512 ,"FT932-8512 _AN-DESCQAA2FT 930519   FT  19 MAY 93 / Cosa Nostra chief taken in Sicily raid      By ROBERT GRAHAM      ROME   ITALIAN security forces yesterday announced the arrest of Mr Nitto Santapaola, the most wanted member of the Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia. Mr Santapaola, who has been sought by authorities for more than 10 years, was surprised at a farm about 80km from his Catania base during a night raid by 400 police. His capture follows the arrest in January of Mr 'Toto' Riina, his main ally in the ruling commission of the Cosa Nostra. Although Interior Ministry officials said yesterday there were 25 people still on the government's most-wanted list, these two arrests represent a significant blow to the Mafia's organisation. Mr Santapaola's capture came five days after a car bomb exploded in the wealthy Parioli residential district of Rome, injuring 23 people. Police are working on the theory that the bombing was the work, at least in part, of the Mafia. Mr Nicola Mancino, interior minister, told parliament yesterday that it was a reasonable assumption the bomb was aimed at Mr Maurico Constanzo, a television talk-show host. Mr Constanzo's car passed three seconds before the explosion, but he was protected from the blast by a wall. However, some parliamentary deputies questioned whether the bomb was not part of a destabilisation campaign conducted by dissident elements within the security services. Mr Luciano Violante, head of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, said yesterday: 'The arrest of Santapaola is not a reply to the bombing in Parioli. . . rather it is another piece in the strategy of continuous assault on the structure of Cosa Nostra, which the state has been carrying out firmly over the past year.' Police claimed they had been closing in on Mr Santapaola for some time. Already 105 arrest warrants had been issued against members of his clan and a further 39 against its allies. The raid was carried out by a special group flown in from the mainland. Mr Santapaola offered no resistance, and merely asked to have a brief breakfast with his wife before being escorted to a maximum security jail. The farm where Mr Santapaola was arrested belonged to Mr Pietro Rampullo, arrested last September and alleged to be behind the killings of two anti-Mafia judges - Mr Giovani Falcone, who died on May 23 last year, and Mr Paolo Borsellino, who died two months later. Mr Santapaola is suspected of involvement in the killings. Police claim the arrest resulted from investigative work, rather than the testimony of former Mafia members who had agreed to co-operate under witness protection programmes. However, there are suggestions that Mr Riina's and Mr Santapaola's violent methods in running the Cosa Nostra had lost them support within the organisation, and that some families were happy to see them captured. In both instances they were caught in or near their home bases.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.   Industries:-  P9211 Courts.   Types:-  PEOP  People.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Police authorities told a subsequent news conference  they believe the accused are responsible for the bombing  incidents that have taken place in different places in Songkhla,  Pattani, and Narathiwat Provinces over the past two years. The  worst of these incidents was the explosion at the railway  station in Hat Yai District where three people were killed and  seventy others injured.    During the arrests the police gathered more evidence --  including firearms and documents in foreign languages -- with  which to incriminate the four preachers. The accused deny the  charges, however, insisting that they have no connection with  the movement responsible for those terrorist activities, which  were designed to show off to some Middle Eastern countries and  hence draw their assistance.    All four teachers are reportedly graduates from schools in  the Middle East. Police authorities are still looking for their  accomplices; some have reportedly fled and taken refuge in  Malaysia.    It should be noted that the authorities have no evidence to  link the four preachers to last year's torching of 35 schools in  the four southern provinces. Some suspected arsonists have  already been arrested, but the investigation has made very  little progress.    The authorities were very careful in handling this case. The  presence of senior police officers and the governor of Songkhla  Province during the arrest of the four was an indication that  the authorities must have sufficient evidence. The detention of  the four preachers, though, has caused suspicion and resentment  among some local Muslims as well as their students, who are very  likely to hold a protest rally. Hopefully, such a rally will be  peaceful, allowing justice to take its course. In any event, at  this point the accused are still innocent because a court has  not found them guilty.    We believe the arrests are a manifestation of the  authorities' determination to punish the culprits and will serve  to inform the general public about the Interior Ministry's  endeavors in this particular case. Unlike the school arsons,  the Interior Ministry has made progress.    We firmly believe that if the suspects have not committed  the  crimes they are accused of, the court of justice will set them  free. The court's decision will depend entirely on the evidence  both sides present during the trial. We therefore appeal to  people who disagree with the arrest of the four suspects to be  patient until the trial. We also appeal to the authorities to  make sure they have sufficient evidence before they take anyone  into custody, because they are playing with other people's  freedom and could sabotage the people's faith in government.

Meanwhile Jordan announced the  arrest of the members of six ""Afghan Arabs"" cells in the context  of its investigations to uncover those who carried out the  bombing operations in Amman and to determine the extent of their  link with al-Ma'ayitah's assassination.    Sources have said that members of the Fatah-Revolutionary  Council who are said to be responsible for al-Ma'ayitah's  assassination, are living normally in Jordan. Libya has denied  any link with al-Ma'ayitah's assassination as reported in Amman.  However, reports that Libya was behind the assassination have  started a crisis in Jordanian-Libyan relations. [passage  omitted]    Reports in Amman linked Libya's support of the  Fatah-Revolutionary Council to the extent of its involvement in  al-Ma'ayitah's assassination, especially as the Jordanian  monarch, King Husayn, pointed to the role of an Arab capital in  the incident. But Libya hastened to deny any link with the  incident, stressing its good relations with Jordan. A Libyan  source said that these reports are designed to harm these  relations.    Some observers believe that Syria is currently trying to  resolve matters between Jordan and Libya. The Syrians believe  that any Jordanian pressure on Tripoli in this connection would  weaken the latter's position in the worsening Lockerbie crisis.  At any rate, it seems that Jordan is trying to identify the  clues to this issue outside Jordanian territory, as the  information available has not indicated that Jordanian security  services have taken any actions against members of the  Fatah-Revolutionary Council or made any arrests in this  connection. It seems that it is seeking to get hold of all  clues in the light of the investigations with those suspected of  carrying out the assassination operation in question in Lebanon,  and to determine whether they have any link with members of this  organization in Jordan.

Italy's main union groups said they would hold a two-hour general strike today to protest at the blast, which came less than two weeks after a similar bombing in Rome. The Florence explosion damaged more than 30 paintings, three irreparably, and caused damage within a radius of 300 metres of the gallery. Florentine police found traces of explosive and the shattered remains of a Fiat Regata in a street adjoining the Uffizi Gallery. Standing in front of what is Italy's most famous art gallery, Mr Alberto Ronchey, the culture minister, said: 'This is a vile act and for the first time people have sought to attack right at the heart of our cultural heritage. 'The Uffizi in the historic centre of Florence is regarded world-wide as a symbol of western culture.' He said the gallery would be closed indefinitely, but added: 'We will seek to open at least part as soon as possible because it is vital that we show we are undeterred and can carry on as normal, especially at the height of the tourist season.' According to Ms Annamaria Petrioli Tofani, director of the Uffizi, the paintings damaged beyond repair were in the Caravagesque Gallery, in the part of the Uffizi nearest the river Arno. A painting by Giotto, the Madonna alla Costa, dating from 1300, was among the other damaged works. Many paintings were saved by their anti-vandal plexiglass shields. Haig Simonian adds from Milan: Mr Luciano Violante, chairman of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, attributed the incident to either the Mafia or the Camorra, its Neapolitan equivalent. They were the only powerful criminal organisations able to mount such an attack and to gain some advantage from the diversion of police resources it would create, he argued.

Islamic Action Front (IAF) deputies took the case of these  and other Islamists detained on security-related cases to Prime  Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali earlier this week and later  circulated their memorandum to the premier for publication in  local newspapers.    Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said the IAF should  have  waited to ""hear the other side of the story"" before releasing  their memorandum in the press.    Dr al-'Anani, in an interview with the Jordan Times, said  that Dr. al-Majali, who met with a delegation of the IAF  deputies Monday evening, ""told them that arrests are not made  indiscriminately and that there were good reasons for the  detentions.""    ""The premier told them that we respect their request to  study  the issue but that since each story has two sides the premier  was going to investigate their charges and bring back the other  side of the story to them"" Dr. al-'Anani said.    In their memorandum to the prime minister, the IAF deputies  listed names of 72 detainees, including the 10 arrested in  connection with an illegal group, and quoted relatives of some  of the detainees with claims of mistreatment.    All of the arrests, as specified in the list provided by the  IAF, have been made since the beginning of this year.    Ten people have been recently arrested for what security  sources said was establishing a ""group planning terrorist  activities."" The sources, quoted by the AL-RA'Y Arabic daily  Wednesday, said the group had ""islamist ties"" and was planning a  series of armed robberies of shops, taxis and at a later stage  banking institutions to collect funds for weapons.    The security sources said the group was headed by a 38-year  old man whom it did not name.    Amman Deputy Hamzah Mansur, the spokesman for the IAF's  parliamentary bloc, told the Jordan Times that their meeting  with the premier dealt with the detention of about 70 people on  charges of belonging to groups to destablise the Kingdom's  security or carry out terrorist attacks.    However, informed sources maintain that the conversation  mainly dealt with the detention of these last 10 Islamists. Mr.  Mansur said that the Monday meeting came after several similar  meetings with the prime minister over the detention of illegal  Islamist groups.    Asked why the IAF deputies decided to publicise this meeting  with the prime minister and not the ones before, Mr. Mansur  said: ""We had received promises of quick releases and ensuring  humane and good treatment of the detainees.""    But, he added, they went to see the prime minister ""because  we felt that the issue still stands.""    In a copy of a memorandum released Wednesday, the IAF asked  the premier to interject on behalf of 72 detainees in Jordanian  prisons and ensure that they receive treatment compatible with  accepted human rights standards.    The deputies said that while they did not condone the  actions  of the detainees they wanted to ""protect the dignity and  freedoms of citizens as guranteed by the Islamic Sharia and our  constitution.""    Mr. Mansur, in his telephone interivew with the Jordan  times,  said that the delegation also wanted the government to release  the detainees when investigations indicate that they were not  party to any illegal activity.    The IAF delegation which met with Dr. al-Majali was composed  of Mr. Masur, Amman Deputy Ibrahim Kaylani, Irbid Deputy  'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Ukur, Amman Deputy Hammam Sa'id, al-Balqa'  Deputy Muhammad 'Uwaydah and al-Karak Deputy Ahmad al-Kasasibah.    ""The delegation briefed the prime minister on the wave  arrests of citizens at this time and what accompanied these  arrests in practices that do not tally with citizens' freedoms  and rights as guaranteed by the Islamic Sharia and our  constitution,"" the IAF said in a statement Wednesday.    ""The prime minister promised to study the memorandum and  deal  with it positively stressing that he will endeavour to apply the  law and protect the diegnity of citizens,"" it said.    In their letter to the prime minister, the IAF deputies  appeared to concentrate their defence on former Afghan fighters  who were arrested after security forces connected some of them  to a series of bomb blasts in third-class cinemas in Amman and  al-Zarqa.    ""Jordan has never lived for itself alone but strove to serve  the nation and higher causes... from this vision some of our  young men flew to Pakistan and Afghanistan when that Islamic  nation fell under Soviet occupation and their deed was  compatible with the wishes of their people, government,"" the IAF  deputies said in their memorandum to the prime minister.    ""People like these should under no circumstances be accused  unless we want to also accuse the Jordanians who answered the  call of duty in Palestine, Iraq, Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, and  others,"" the memo added.    ""We refuse that contributing to help others of our faith in  Afghanistan be considered a crime,"" the memo concluded.    The IAF deputies also criticized what they said was a wave  of  arrests of university students. They also said that there were  ""regretful events in the University of Jordan from parties known  to the security forces aimed to influence the students.""    The deputies were particularly careful in their criticism of  the arrest of persons connected to bomb blasts and bombing  attempts. While condemning ""any act which targets any  institution on the land of our country and any attempt to  destabilise the atmosphere in the country and hope that those  involved in these kind of acts would be referred to court,"" the  memorandum said, the IAF ""also believes that a defendant remains  innocent and should exercise his right to defend himself until  proven guilty.""    The IAF deputies also criticised the crackdown on members of  the Fatah Revolutionary Council (Abu-Nidal) group after their  group was connected to the gunning down of Jordanian diplomat  Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut in January.    ""While we condemn this ugly crime against a faithful son of  Jordan we condemn the indiscriminate arrests,"" the memorandum  said.    Dr. al-'Anani said that the prime minister had listened to  the IAF's arguments and impressed on them that he believed there  were ""sound and convincing reasons"" for the detentions.    ""But in light of the fact that they had come asking him to  look into the case and the charges of the relatives, the primier  said that he was going to check their claims and come back to  them with his findings,"" Dr. al-'Anani said.    Dr. al-Majali, the information minister said, also told the  IAF deputies that ""he will make sure that justice takes its  course.""     "
0,FT932-10438 ,"FT932-10438 _AN-DEIATADFFT 930508   FT  08 MAY 93 / Guards held over City looting: Many tenants report thefts from offices after IRA bomb      By Our Financial Staff   THREE SECURITY guards were arrested by the City of London police yesterday in connection with theft from buildings damaged by the IRA bomb two weeks ago. The police said the latest arrests, together with five arrests made last weekend, concerned six burglaries committed in the wake of the bomb blast in Bishopsgate. Nine 'relatively minor' thefts were reported by tenants after they regained access to their buildings five days after the bomb. Bottles of wine, paintings, fountain pens, Dictaphones and petty cash were among items reported stolen. 'The things that were taken were small in value terms but disproportionately upsetting,' said Mr Chris Manners of Norton Rose, a firm of solicitors, which believes the thefts took place on the Monday after the bomb. 'They were often things of sentimental value.' 'It's more upsetting than the bomb itself,' said one solicitor, whose office was looted and vandalised. He said that when staff returned to the office on the Tuesday after the bombing they found most desks, drawers and cabinets had been forced open and drinks cabinets emptied. Petty cash, cheques, squash rackets, gold pens, luggage and wine were taken from the London office of Blake Cassells  Graydon, a Toronto law firm, which had an office on the 15th floor of 99 Bishopsgate. 'It's crystal clear that widespread pilfering has been going on and that whoever was responsible had the time to go through the office and decide just what they wanted,' said Mr David Glennie, managing partner. 'It's very, very disturbing. It's bad enough to have had your offices sprayed with glass and have suffered other damage without someone coming along and dancing on your grave.' The Banco di Sicilia, which has offices at 99 Bishopsgate, said some paintings were stolen during the bank holiday weekend. Mr Peter Franklin, finance director of Rea Brothers, reported thefts from the merchant bank's offices in Alderman's House, Alderman's Walk, before the building was fully secured. The thieves, whom he described as 'rank amateurs', had jemmied open desks, forced briefcases and taken small items of little value from offices. 'They even broke open a coffee machine to steal the money inside, not realising that the coffee was free so there was no money,' he said. Many of the companies affected said that the large numbers of workers drafted in to clear up the bomb damage had created conditions for opportunistic theft. Mr David Stedman, managing partner at Penningtons, solicitors, said security in the building had been a problem after the bombing, with different security staff and contractors working for different tenants. 'It was very difficult to know just who everybody was,' he said. 'It would have been easy for anyone to put on a hard hat and come into a building,' said Mr Chris Manners of Norton Rose, solicitors.

0,FT923-14463 ,"FT923-14463 _AN-CGHATAAFFT 920708   FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (6) - Carving out their own market niche / Conferences / All the main hotels have facilities while the World Trade Centre leads the way with both exhibitions and conferences      By ANNE COUNSELL   Unashamedly promoting itself as the last word in luxury, the soon-to-be opened Royal Abjar Hotel's list of features includes: 'wide door space to drive in vehicles for product launches.' This, appearing alongside descriptions of lavish elegance, such as 2,200kg of crystal chandeliers cascading from the ceiling, illustrates the emphasis on and the importance accorded to fairs and seminars. Extravagant furnishings are the jam, conferences and trade promotions are the bread and butter. Hotels have carved out their own niche in the market. Attracting a steady flow of press conferences and business gatherings, the spin-offs include the provision of catering facilities and accommodation for those attending the gathering. In April and May there were nearly 300 product launches - everything from a new nail varnish to the Ford Aerostar compact bus - with more than half staged in hotels. Notice boards in hotel foyers make interesting reading and are tantamount to advertising bulletin boards. In the space of three days, one hotel staged a seminar on 'Investment in East Germany' held by the Treuhand privatisation agency, two product launches, a shipping conference, a bankers' business lunch and a kiwi fruit promotion. All the main hotels can boast of sizeable display facilities and a variety of meeting rooms furnished with presentation aids from flip charts, projectors and videos to, in some cases, electronic voting and translation services. In tandem with its increased trading activities, the emirate has developed the trade promotion and display side to a sophisticated level. A case in point was Dubai Airport's state-of-the-art Cargo Village and the prestigious '91 Airshow. The official opening of the freight handling and storage complex was timed to coincide with the air show in November. At the very time that the international aerospace industry needed to bring in cumbersome and expensive aircraft equipment for the high-profile show, the ribbon for the cargo village was cut. Clearance times through the freight terminal had been honed down to just 13 minutes and the air show subsequently went on to put Dubai firmly on the aerospace circuit, third in size after Farnbrough and Paris. Hotels are already fully booked for the '93 Dubai Airshow. Similarly, the defence exhibition staged in January this year attracted a lot of interest from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the Gulf crisis still fresh in their memories. Equipment such as the Starbust laser-guided anti-aircraft missile was on display alongside armoured vehicles, weaponry and surveillance systems. Sales and contract figures were not readily forthcoming but were respectively estimated as being 'large' and 'good.' Leading the way in both exhibitions and conferences is the World Trade Centre (WTC). Putting itself on the map was accomplished in physical terms by virtue of its size - at 39 storeys it is the tallest building in the Arabian Gulf. Making its mark on the international exhibitions circuit has been achieved by a combination of efficiency and sheer audacity on the part of the centre's dynamic management team. Epitomising the free trade spirit of the emirate, the centre pulled off the Middle East International Motor Show in record time and against all the odds. In November 1991, two years ahead of schedule, the Dubai motor show became international and succeeded in attracting manufacturers such as BMW which had declined to exhibit their 5-series Touring at London's Motorshow. Forlorn exhibitors, who had moped around at the Frankfurt, London and Tokyo motor fairs, depressed by strikes, recession and stock market falls, brought their vehicles to Dubai and found a booming market and sales. The trade centre then did it again with the Watersport and Powerboat show in February. May saw the 'Britain in the Gulf 92 ' exhibition, the largest mounted in the Arab World with 250 British companies displaying their products. Exhibitors such as Starlite Chandeliers, sold their entire stock before the exhibition started and notched up a Pounds 115,000 order on the first day. FEL International negotiated a Pounds 3.5m order for four straddle cranes. The calender of exhibitions and conferences at the centre now extends to 40 a year and encompasses every sector from oil and gas to computing and camels, fashion and overseas investment. The WTC is a member of the World Trade Centres Association and is supported by its own residential apartments complex and on-site hotel, the Hilton. The three exhibition halls with adjacent external display areas provide a total of 14,509 square metres of internal floor space plus 6,120 square metres for outdoor exhibiting, all backed by an array of administrative and management services. The WTC has also established a management development centre offering a range of courses in management and results-oriented training, in addition to an Arabic language centre with a range of general and private courses at all levels. Succumbing to the jam side of the conferences business, the centre has set up the World Trade Club on the top floor of the tower. Its membership list reads like a Who's Who of the region's senior businessmen and, like the Royal Abjar Hotel, it oozes luxury with panelled dining rooms on different themes. A recent conference entitled the 'Travel Trade Forum' drew participants from leading hotel chains, international airlines and global marketing agencies. The active management of the World Trade Centre, rubbing shoulders with tourism ministers and senior advisers and mingling with speakers from the Economist Intelligence Unit and the City University Business School, seems to have followed the line of one of the conference's workshops: 'Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there.'

The defeat came after a stormy year in which Mr Guttman was accused by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of violating trading rules. Known for his brash style and his ability to get things done, Mr Guttman helped build the Nymex into one of the most successful futures markets in the world. The exchange had pre-tax earnings of Dollars 27m last year, and about Dollars 100m cash in reserve. Unlike some of its New York neighbours Nymex's volume is booming and seat prices have doubled during Mr Guttman's term in office. The exchange has the largest crude oil market in the world and has successfully diversified its energy lines into natural gas and other products. Despite the successes, Mr Guttman's legal problems were feared to reflect unfavourably on the exchange and its customers. The CFTC delivered its civil charges against Mr. Guttman less than a month ago, after warning him in July of a pending case. The Nymex Board immediately asked Mr Guttman to step down, but - true to his style - he refused, saying he would defend himself against the charges, and that the membership should have the right to choose its leadership. Some Nymex members thought Mr Guttman's efforts to keep New York's futures exchanges in business after the February 26 bomb blast at the World Trade Center would help his re-election effort. He is credited with convincing police and fire officials that the markets should open, despite impaired ventilation and fire protection systems at the WTC trading facility. Mr Rappaport defeated Mr Guttman by 386 votes to 213. The new chairman strongly supports the Nymex's move to a new trading facility in mid-1994 and he sees potential in the exchange's Access electronic trading system. Mr Rappaport also would like to see more co-operation between New York exchanges. His election could pave the way for another Nymex bid for the ailing New York Commodity Exchange. The Comex is currently entertaining takeover offers from the Chicago Board of Trade and a smaller New York market, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.

But officials are declining comment on  whether there was any evidence to indicate that a single group  was behind the two blasts.    Interior Minister Salamah Hammad confirmed the arrest of  five  people on Wednesday [2 February], one day after a bomb tore  through the Salwa movie theatre in al-Zarqa, injuring two  people, one of them seriously.    The minister said investigations were continuing and that  investigators were keeping all possibilities open. Other  sources said more arrests were made but did not disclose any  details.    The Salwa blast followed a similar explosion on Jan. 26 at  the Rivoli movie house in downtown Amman which injured seven  people, one of them seriously.    The common features of the two bombings were that both  occurred at establishments screening X-rated moves and the  nature of the explosive devices were the same. In addition, the  exact place where the bombs, described as crude homemade devices  lacking any sophistication, was also the same--near the  projection rooms.    More importantly, however, according to sources, the bombs  were of the same type as that of devices removed and defused  before they exploded at two liquor stores over the past six  months. In turn, those devices appeared to have been built with  the same technique that was used by the extremist underground  group called Jaysh Muhammad (Muhammad's Army), the sources said.    ""It is premature to point the finger at any specific group  despite the common features of the explosive devices,"" said one  source. ""Anyone who ever worked with the Afghan Mujahidin could  have learnt the technique.""    Jaysh Muhammad is believed to comprise mostly of Jordanian  volunteers who fought with the Afghan rebels and returned home  after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1990.    Eighteen members of the group were found guilty of carrying  out or plotting attacks against government officials, security  officers, state buildings and foreign diplomats as well as  liquor stores and night clubs in 1992.    Eight of them, including two in absentia, were sentenced to  death. The death sentences, except those on the two at large,  were commuted to life terms by His Majesty King Husayn.    Jaysh Muhammad was at one point alleged to be the ""military  wing"" of the Muslim Brotherhood, but the Brotherhood has  categorically denied any such link with the group.    According to experts on the Islamic movement in Jordan,  Jaysh  Muhammad was set up by hardliners who belonged to the  Brotherhood who were disillusioned with what they saw as the  leadership's moderate approach and confining the group to the  mainstream political process in Jordan.    The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the  Brotherhood, has denounced the Jan. 26 bombing saying violence  was not the means to prevent cinemas from showing films that  many see as incompatible with the conservative Jordanian society.

0,FT941-4158 ,"FT941-4158 _AN-ECMANAB0FT 940312   FT  12 MAR 94 / Legal limit of safety: The Heathrow attack has highlighted UK security again      By MICHAEL CASSELL and JIMMY BURNS   The scenario is familiar. A spectacular IRA mortar attack - this time at London's Heathrow airport and audaciously restaged within 36 hours - followed by political squabbles over allegedly lax security and a further, inevitable, tightening of anti-terrorist measures. The republican paramilitaries have proved yet again they retain not only the capacity to strike on the British mainland, but the capability to penetrate the extensive and expensively constructed armour of national security. On past form - not always a reliable guide to what it will do next - the IRA may now be content for a while to pursue its mainland offensive via the telephone. Which head of security will, in the days ahead, run the risk of dismissing an anonymous message about an unspecified attack? Whatever lies ahead, each new assault brings a fresh appraisal of existing security and, invariably, further unwelcome restrictions on the free movement of people going about their everyday business. In Northern Ireland, such measures have for years formed part of the paraphernalia employed against terrorism. But now there are road blocks in the City of London and video cameras strung along UK high streets to monitor the innocent and the untoward. Police go to the brink of legality selectively to stop and search. To minimise the ever-present terrorist threat invokes accusations, already being bandied about by politicians yesterday, of dangerous negligence; to implement a draconian clamp-down hands the terrorists another form of victory. But, beyond the rhetoric, how much more can be usefully done in a world where home-made weaponry mounted in a Nissan Micra can thwart the best endeavours of 1,400 airport security staff, and threaten carnage in a supposedly high-security zone? The battle inevitably focuses primarily on trying to identify, locate and arrest the IRA 'volunteers' who still plan murderous attacks while their political masters talk of peace. The IRA has changed its internal organisation in recent years in a way that makes it more difficult to keep track of its operations and identify its main players. The organisation has become more decentralised with individual, active unit 'cells' operating autonomously, so that it is less vulnerable to penetration by the security services. There are, of course, exceptions. In Ulster itself, the recent rate of success against paramilitaries has been good, while another mainland bombing campaign was halted with last month's arrests and weapons seizure in Accrington, Lancashire. The security services have tried to match the increasing logistical sophistication of the IRA with their own reorganisation. Two years ago, the government agreed that MI5, the domestic intelligence service, should replace the Metropolitan Police in leading intelligence-gathering on the IRA. In addition MI5 has a specific role as policy adviser to the government on anti-terrorism. According to security sources, the move has gone some way towards streamlining intelligence-gathering, which was previously subject to intense inter-service rivalries. Tensions still persist, however, in relationships between M15 and the Metropolitan Police Special Branch - still in charge of operations - and between the various regional police forces which are expected to contribute their resources to localised IRA threats. Yesterday's call by Mr David Mellor, former Home Office minister, for a national anti-terrorist force drawing police and security forces under one roof is not a new idea and will continue to be resisted by those jealously guarding their own patches. More localised initiatives have had some success. The City, shattered twice by IRA lorry bombs in 1992 and 1993, reacted positively, if controversially, to its own bloody experiences. Though no one will tempt fate by declaring victory, the decision effectively to shut down core areas of the square mile and to step up high-profile policing has, so far, had the desired effect. After the Baltic Exchange bombing in November 1992, the City police put more officers, including some from the CID and fraud squad, on to the streets, while the Home Office provided more personnel. City police introduced 24-hour patrols of armed officers, who employ powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act to halt and question anyone they want. In the wake of the Bishopsgate bomb in April 1993, the police worked with the City corporation to implement the controversial road closure programme intended to end the threat of vehicle-borne bombs. Cameras at eight entry points record not only vehicles but passengers' faces. But high security in one area carries the risk of terrorist activity being transferred to another. The IRA takes a perverse pride not just in employing new weaponry but in wrong-footing the authorities in its deadly game of cat and mouse. According to a City police source: 'We all recognise the danger that, in putting up barriers, you simply shift attention to new targets. But that doesn't mean that you can do nothing.' Major John Wyatt, an anti-terrorist expert who has been advising City firms on security in the aftermath of Bishopsgate, says permanent checkpoints are not a solution: 'The IRA is always quick to exploit set patterns of control.' The key to deterrence, he believes, lies in flexible controls and improved intelligence. The police, for good measure, would like wider powers of arrest and detention. But everyone involved in the daily battle against terrorism will privately admit one inalienable truth. Ultimately the answer will have to be found by politicians and not by the forces of law and order.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

""France and Belgium are thinking along the same lines on  this  matter,"" a Belgian diplomatic source stated.    The question of a ministerial declaration to be added to the  final document establishing the agreement of the 117 GATT  members on greater liberalization of world trade has yet to be  settled.    Several signatory countries are opposed to it and the  European Trade Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, who negotiated on  behalf of the Twelve, is reportedly in favor of a general  declaration which they would all support.    ""The EU must submit a text offering a broader vision of  links  between trade and the environment, and between trade and social  protection,"" a Belgian source indicated.    These questions ""received too little attention during the  Uruguay Round,"" Robert Urbain, the Belgian European affairs  minister, told his colleagues at the Council of Ministers.    ""We must make the most of the Marrakech conference to make  up  for this shortcoming, and in sufficiently broad terms to lay  down genuine avenues for future thought rather than simply  listing the most flagrant excesses such as slavery or forced  labor,"" he added.    Belgium therefore recommends the drawing up of ""an agenda  for  the future"" in order to strengthen ""the link between social  rights, the environment and trade,"" Mr. Urbain stated.    France and Belgium head the ""maximalists"" who favor a  declaration by the Twelve ""making it clearly known that the EU  intends to see the World Trade Organization launch a global  debate on the environment and the social question,"" explained a  senior Belgian civil servant.    The Twelve have unanimously condemned the American decision  to reintroduce the so-called super 301 procedure which allows  the United States to take retaliatory measures against countries  which fail to sufficiently open up their markets to U.S.  products.    ""This measure does not directly affect us for the moment,  but  the Twelve believe that the use of this section sends out a bad  signal just before the signing of an agreement that is supposed  to commit everyone to a multilateral settlement of trade  differences,"" stressed a Belgian source.

By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Arrests of illegal aliens are on the rise in Ventura County after a two-year  decline that followed immigration reforms in 1986, U.S. immigration officials  said Thursday.    U.S. Border Patrol officers arrested 1,375 undocumented aliens in Ventura and  Santa Barbara counties during the six-month period from October to March. Most  arrests were in Ventura County.    That is more than double the 666 arrests made during the same period in fiscal  1989, said Mike Molloy, who supervises the U.S. Border Patrol station in  Oxnard.    Molloy said he was concerned that the increase in arrests is a sign that more  illegal immigrants are entering Ventura County -- a notion strongly disputed  Thursday by local critics of U.S. immigration policy.    ""Any time you see an increase in apprehensions like that, it's going to concern  me as an immigration officer,"" Molloy said.    Before the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was passed, the number of  undocumented immigrants apprehended annually in the Ventura and Santa Barbara  area had been rising steadily, Molloy said.    In 1985, the year before the immigration reforms took effect, arrests were up  to 5,683 for the calendar year, he said.    After immigration reform laws were enacted, the number of illegal workers  arrested in the two counties by Border Patrol agents plummeted by more than  76%, dropping to its lowest point of 1,333 arrests in 1988.    Last year, however, the number of arrests began to rise dramatically, as 2,724  people were apprehended by the Border Patrol agents.    Molloy said changes in staffing have made a difference in the number of arrests  that Border Patrol officers have made in Ventura County.    One reason for the drop in arrests in 1988, he said, was the loss of two  officers -- nearly half the five-person work force at the Oxnard Border Patrol  station -- for three months at the end of that year. Those officers were not  replaced until 1989.    This year, Border Patrol agents departed from their regular practice of  inspecting workplaces and focused on apprehending illegal immigrants in the  Ventura County Jail.    Molloy cited a special program launched Feb. 1 to capture criminal aliens.  Since the program started, Border Patrol officers have captured 194 illegal  immigrants who already served a jail sentence.    Although the focus on undocumented immigrants in jail is not new, Border Patrol  agents have not concentrated their entire work force on undocumented criminals,  Molloy said.    ""What we're doing is removing people who have violated our laws,"" Molloy said.  ""We're removing them from the country.""    A jump in the number of arrests of illegal immigrants is being seen all along  the U.S.-Mexican border and in agricultural counties such as Ventura, said  Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service  in Washington.    ""We're showing increases on a monthly basis,"" Jervis said.    Nationally, arrests of undocumented workers during the first six months of the  fiscal year jumped by about 37% over the same period last year, he said.    In the past, INS officials have used statistics to indicate the deterrent  effect that the 1986 law has had on illegal immigration.    The law allowed illegal aliens who had been living in the United States for  years to become legal citizens under a federal amnesty program. It also imposed  fines on employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers.    Arrests declined briefly after the immigration law was passed because many of  the illegal immigrants sought legal status. Others were deterred from coming to  the United States by fears that jobs were unavailable, Jervis said.    ""We had a major dip . . . because people truly believed they could not get jobs  here,"" Jervis said.    Fear has since dissipated as illegal immigrants have become aware of the  availability of fraudulent documents that will allow them to work in the United  States, Jervis said. The worsening economy in Mexico and continuing military  conflicts in Central America continue to drive immigrants north, he added.    However, critics of the INS statistics say those figures have been unreliable  and should not be taken to indicate that illegal immigration is on the  increase.    They argue that the number of undocumented workers arrested depends on other  factors, such as Border Patrol staffing and changes in national immigration  policy.    Armando Garcia, an immigration counselor for El Concilio del Condado de  Ventura, a Latino advocacy group based in Oxnard, said he has not seen a steady  increase in illegal immigrants and questioned the validity of the INS  statistics.

REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The number of illegal immigrants arrested in August was the highest in 30  months in the San Diego area, and overall arrests of aliens have increased 30%  this year, a U.S. Border Patrol spokesman said Tuesday.    The 52,440 arrests in August kept pace with a dramatic increase in the number  of alien arrests along the U.S.-Mexican border -- after a three-year decrease  -- first reported in April. On Tuesday, Border Patrol Agent Ted Swofford said  more than 98% of the immigrants arrested in August were Mexicans.    The last time more arrests were made in a month was in February, 1988, when  54,527 arrests were reported.    In April, Border Patrol officials reported a 50% increase in the number of  arrests between October, 1989, and March, 1990, for the San Diego area,  contrasted with the corresponding period for 1988-89. Nationwide, the increase  was slightly more than 30% for the same period.    Swofford blamed the increase in illegal immigrants on the deteriorating Mexican  economy and the easy availability of forged documents in the United States that  enable many aliens to get jobs.    He said a forged visa and Social Security card, both needed to prove to an  employer that a job seeker is in the United States legally, can be purchased  for $50 to $150. Under the 1986 law, employers can be fined and jailed for  knowingly hiring illegal immigrants.    ""The word has gotten back to Mexico that counterfeit documents are relatively  inexpensive to get. For a few bucks, you can buy a counterfeit immigration  document and Social Security card, which will enable you to get a job. The  deterrent factor of the law has been diminished,"" he said.    Critics of the immigration law have said it won't put a dent in illegal  immigration until Congress recognizes the economic, social and political  reasons that force many Mexicans to leave their country -- legally or illegally  -- for greater opportunities in the United States.    Border Patrol agents are also arresting more families these days, Swofford  said.    ""Our apprehensions are now about 20% women and kids. Five years ago, they were  probably no more than 10%,"" he said.    In August, agents also seized 653 vehicles allegedly used by alien smugglers,  and 112 of the seized cars were reported stolen. Both figures represent record  highs.    Another factor in the growing number of apprehensions of vehicles and illegal  immigrants was an increase by 80 in the number of agents assigned to the San  Diego area, Swofford said.

Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and deputy  Dublin premier Dick Spring are to meet near the Irish Republic's  border with Ulster in Co Cavan at the formal opening of a  restored canal.    The pair had already agreed on a two-hour exchange of views  on the progress of their two governments' current push for a  Northern Ireland settlement in the light of Britain's reply last  week to questions posed by Sinn Fein -- the IRA's political wing  -- about the five-month-old Downing Street peace declaration.    But the gun and bomb attack on a Dublin pub as Sinn Fein  staged a fund-raising event on the premises has sharpened the  agenda for the discussions. The loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force  [UVF] tonight claimed responsibility for the attack which left  one man dead and a second wounded.    In a statement released in Belfast today, the outlawed  terror  group boasted that it had ""struck at the very heart of the  republican movement in its own back yard.""    Mr Spring tonight said he was disturbed about what happened,  and confirmed the bombing would be high on the agenda when he  saw Sir Patrick.    One doorman was shot dead and another seriously wounded when  they blocked the entry of the gang of bombers.    The intruders fled after the shooting, leaving their holdall  bomb. Its failure to ignite prevented certain carnage, police  said.    Both Mr Spring and Prime Minister Albert Reynolds -- who is  due to have talks on peace of his own in London later this week  with John Major -- had already signalled their growing concern  about loyalist attacks in Belfast and other parts of Northern  Ireland.    The spread of the violence across the border -- and deep  into  the centre of Dublin -- has rung security alarm bells in both  the Irish capital and Belfast. The fear was that the incident  at the Widow Scallan's bar could herald the opening of a new  campaign in the Irish Republic. Until now the assumption had  been that loyalist paramilitaries lacked the expertise and the  neccessary network of escape routes to strike so far south.    Yet the signs were that not only had their raid been  executed, even though the 18lb commercial mix bomb failed to go  off, but the three-man gang had either got back safely into  Ulster, or gone to ground at a ""safe-house"". The belief among  Dublin police tonight was that the gang had carefully laid plans  to escape from the Republic before road checkpoints were in  operation at around midnight on Saturday night.    The UVF assault was the most menacing by Ulster loyalists  south of the border since 1974, when bombs in Dublin and the  frontier town of Monaghan claimed 33 lives.    Suspicions have persisted among relatives of the dead that  loyalists were aided then by Northern Ireland-based security  personnel. No arrests were ever made in connection with those  bombings.    Since that time, most loyalist activity in the south has  been  restricted to firebombings and incidents around the border.  Eight years ago, audacious gunmen fired on the Dublin  headquarters of Sinn Fein, and earlier this year, incendiary  devices were mailed to the same address.     "

A panel of judges acquitted two people after ruling  there was insufficient evidence to tie them to the Dec. 23 bombing of an  express train as it passed through a tunnel between Florence and Bologna.

AIR POWER ALONE ISN'T ENOUGH;    WARFARE: THEORIES THAT STRATEGIC BOMBING CAN BREAK THE OTHER SIDE ARE JUST  THAT. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED DURING WORLD WAR II OR VIETNAM.      By Gregory M. Grant, Gregory M. Grant is a military analyst at the Center for  Strategic and International Studies. He is co-authoring a book on the  operational lessons of recent wars.      WASHINGTON      The showdown in the Persian Gulf has catalyzed the debate over the role of air  power in warfare. The United States cannot match the Iraqi army man-for-man,  let alone obtain the 3-1 odds military theory deems necessary for offensive  success. Instead, U.S. military leaders hope to mass enough high-tech weaponry  in the gulf to destroy Saddam Hussein's favorite police instrument -- his  military -- in a short air campaign. Pundits in the media and on the Hill echo  assertions made until last week by Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael J.  Dugan, that ""air power is the only answer.""    Such claims are the current version of an argument first voiced by the  post-World War I ""air-power"" theorists. While the United States has amassed an  impressive aerial arsenal in the gulf region, the assertion that air power  alone could ""win"" a war against Iraq demands an evaluation of the theories and  the evidence that gave birth to that idea.    The contentiousness that surrounds the air-power debate stems largely from the  empirical evidence these arguments rely on: the campaigns of World War II,  where air power's performance was uneven. But the theoretical basis for an  air-power doctrine goes back to immediately after World War I. The infant air  arms of the Great War had no real influence on the outcome. But the ability of  bombers to overfly land and seas to drop high explosives on cities and  industrial centers had a powerful impact on the thinking of the inter-war air  power theorists.    The high-flying bomber appeared to many as the optimal weapon for ""total war.""  In what had become a predominantly economic-industrial contest, the bomber  offered optimistic strategists a weapon to destroy the vital industries that  churned out the instruments of war. Thus, the bloody and protracted stalemate  of World War I trench warfare could be avoided. Air-power theorists on both  sides of the Atlantic were convinced strategic bombing could bring a nation to  its knees by targeting material and moral resources.    From the first screams of dive-bombing Stukas, World War II offered a proving  ground for the various air-power theories. Yet after an offensive by 3,000  German Luftwaffe aircraft against Britain, four years of night bombing by the  RAF Bomber Command and daylight raids by the U.S. Air Force across Germany and  the relentless U.S. bombardment of Japan, the debate over the effectiveness of  strategic air power is unresolved.    Air-power theorists had grossly mistaken the impact that raining tons of  high-explosives on civilians would have on a nation's determination to defeat  those responsible for the bombing. Instead of demoralizing England's will for  resistance, Germany's indiscriminate bombing of population centers bolstered  the British nation's will for victory. The German error in misjudging British  national resolve was surpassed only by the RAF Bomber Command's failure to  anticipate that British bombing of Germany would prove equally  counterproductive.    If strategic bombing was unsuccessful in demoralizing a nation's will to fight,  its effectiveness in destroying the war effort of either Germany or Japan was  even less impressive. Instead of passively accepting annihilation, targeted  industries dispersed and decentralized.    One need not read the 321 reports published by the U.S. Strategic Bombing  Survey after World War II to realize that the Allied bombing offensive was far  from decisive. That is illustrated by German industry production figures.  Output doubled from 1942 to 1944 and reached its highest figure in late 1944 --  at the height of the bombing campaign. The effects of strategic bombing on  Japan's centralized industrial base was equally unimpressive.    The strategic employment of air power since 1945 has only reinforced the  conclusions drawn from World War II. The primary achievement of the massive  aerial bombardment unleashed against North Vietnam, intended to pressure Hanoi,  only stiffened the North's resolve. Despite dropping thousands of B-52 loads on  dense jungle and repeated bombing attacks on roadways in the North, air power  was never able to seal off South Vietnam from the infiltration of men and  materiel.    The bombing campaign carried out by both sides in the Iran-Iraq War also failed  to produce a decisive victory. The employment of missiles targeted against  cities had little more impact than German V-1 and V-2 attacks on Britain.    Despite the desultory effects of strategic bombing, air power used in  coordination with ground forces exerts a considerable influence. Luftwaffe  operations against Poland and France in 1940, and Russia in 1941, were  successful when employed with attacking ground forces. During the Allied  offensive in France, air power supported the drive on Berlin.    Tactical air operations in the last 40 years have often produced the same  results. Air power played a vital role in supporting the attacks of the British  ground units in the fighting for the Falklands Islands. In the Arab-Israeli  wars, Israel has always achieved air superiority, using aircraft to support the  movement of ground forces. Although air power alone cannot win wars, it is also  true that the side that does not have air superiority has never won a war.    But the Israelis never use air power as an independent arm -- they coordinate  air and ground attacks. The Israeli's realize the fundamental limitation of air  power: It cannot seize and hold territory; only ground units can do that. Thus,  it is in conjunction with ground forces -- to support an advance, or to hamper  a retreat -- that air power is most effective.    Advances in technology in the last 20 years have resulted in vast improvements  in aircraft armament. Pilots can achieve degrees of accuracy undreamt of by the  early air-power theorists. In an air campaign against Iraq, U.S. air attacks  would have a devastating effect on exposed supply convoys and ground units.    But technology plays both ways. Air-defense systems have been significantly  bolstered by technological improvements. The Arab-Israeli wars have shown that  so many aircraft may have to target air defenses that the aircraft will be  unable to support the ground forces.    Air power alone will not achieve the stated objective of forcing Hussein to  withdraw from Kuwait. Though air power would be a fundamental component of a  U.S. offensive, it would have to be in conjunction with ground attacks. Looking  to air power as a self-sufficient instrument of victory to avoid American  casualties is as illusory as the pre-World War II theory that bombers would  obviate the need for large-scale ground warfare.

AIR POWER ALONE ISN'T ENOUGH;    WARFARE: THEORIES THAT STRATEGIC BOMBING CAN BREAK THE OTHER SIDE ARE JUST  THAT. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED DURING WORLD WAR II OR VIETNAM.      By Gregory M. Grant, Gregory M. Grant is a military analyst at the Center for  Strategic and International Studies. He is co-authoring a book on the  operational lessons of recent wars.      WASHINGTON      The showdown in the Persian Gulf has catalyzed the debate over the role of air  power in warfare. The United States cannot match the Iraqi army man-for-man,  let alone obtain the 3-1 odds military theory deems necessary for offensive  success. Instead, U.S. military leaders hope to mass enough high-tech weaponry  in the gulf to destroy Saddam Hussein's favorite police instrument -- his  military -- in a short air campaign. Pundits in the media and on the Hill echo  assertions made until last week by Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael J.  Dugan, that ""air power is the only answer.""    Such claims are the current version of an argument first voiced by the  post-World War I ""air-power"" theorists. While the United States has amassed an  impressive aerial arsenal in the gulf region, the assertion that air power  alone could ""win"" a war against Iraq demands an evaluation of the theories and  the evidence that gave birth to that idea.    The contentiousness that surrounds the air-power debate stems largely from the  empirical evidence these arguments rely on: the campaigns of World War II,  where air power's performance was uneven. But the theoretical basis for an  air-power doctrine goes back to immediately after World War I. The infant air  arms of the Great War had no real influence on the outcome. But the ability of  bombers to overfly land and seas to drop high explosives on cities and  industrial centers had a powerful impact on the thinking of the inter-war air  power theorists.    The high-flying bomber appeared to many as the optimal weapon for ""total war.""  In what had become a predominantly economic-industrial contest, the bomber  offered optimistic strategists a weapon to destroy the vital industries that  churned out the instruments of war. Thus, the bloody and protracted stalemate  of World War I trench warfare could be avoided. Air-power theorists on both  sides of the Atlantic were convinced strategic bombing could bring a nation to  its knees by targeting material and moral resources.    From the first screams of dive-bombing Stukas, World War II offered a proving  ground for the various air-power theories. Yet after an offensive by 3,000  German Luftwaffe aircraft against Britain, four years of night bombing by the  RAF Bomber Command and daylight raids by the U.S. Air Force across Germany and  the relentless U.S. bombardment of Japan, the debate over the effectiveness of  strategic air power is unresolved.    Air-power theorists had grossly mistaken the impact that raining tons of  high-explosives on civilians would have on a nation's determination to defeat  those responsible for the bombing. Instead of demoralizing England's will for  resistance, Germany's indiscriminate bombing of population centers bolstered  the British nation's will for victory. The German error in misjudging British  national resolve was surpassed only by the RAF Bomber Command's failure to  anticipate that British bombing of Germany would prove equally  counterproductive.    If strategic bombing was unsuccessful in demoralizing a nation's will to fight,  its effectiveness in destroying the war effort of either Germany or Japan was  even less impressive. Instead of passively accepting annihilation, targeted  industries dispersed and decentralized.    One need not read the 321 reports published by the U.S. Strategic Bombing  Survey after World War II to realize that the Allied bombing offensive was far  from decisive. That is illustrated by German industry production figures.  Output doubled from 1942 to 1944 and reached its highest figure in late 1944 --  at the height of the bombing campaign. The effects of strategic bombing on  Japan's centralized industrial base was equally unimpressive.    The strategic employment of air power since 1945 has only reinforced the  conclusions drawn from World War II. The primary achievement of the massive  aerial bombardment unleashed against North Vietnam, intended to pressure Hanoi,  only stiffened the North's resolve. Despite dropping thousands of B-52 loads on  dense jungle and repeated bombing attacks on roadways in the North, air power  was never able to seal off South Vietnam from the infiltration of men and  materiel.    The bombing campaign carried out by both sides in the Iran-Iraq War also failed  to produce a decisive victory. The employment of missiles targeted against  cities had little more impact than German V-1 and V-2 attacks on Britain.    Despite the desultory effects of strategic bombing, air power used in  coordination with ground forces exerts a considerable influence. Luftwaffe  operations against Poland and France in 1940, and Russia in 1941, were  successful when employed with attacking ground forces. During the Allied  offensive in France, air power supported the drive on Berlin.    Tactical air operations in the last 40 years have often produced the same  results. Air power played a vital role in supporting the attacks of the British  ground units in the fighting for the Falklands Islands. In the Arab-Israeli  wars, Israel has always achieved air superiority, using aircraft to support the  movement of ground forces. Although air power alone cannot win wars, it is also  true that the side that does not have air superiority has never won a war.    But the Israelis never use air power as an independent arm -- they coordinate  air and ground attacks. The Israeli's realize the fundamental limitation of air  power: It cannot seize and hold territory; only ground units can do that. Thus,  it is in conjunction with ground forces -- to support an advance, or to hamper  a retreat -- that air power is most effective.    Advances in technology in the last 20 years have resulted in vast improvements  in aircraft armament. Pilots can achieve degrees of accuracy undreamt of by the  early air-power theorists. In an air campaign against Iraq, U.S. air attacks  would have a devastating effect on exposed supply convoys and ground units.    But technology plays both ways. Air-defense systems have been significantly  bolstered by technological improvements. The Arab-Israeli wars have shown that  so many aircraft may have to target air defenses that the aircraft will be  unable to support the ground forces.    Air power alone will not achieve the stated objective of forcing Hussein to  withdraw from Kuwait. Though air power would be a fundamental component of a  U.S. offensive, it would have to be in conjunction with ground attacks. Looking  to air power as a self-sufficient instrument of victory to avoid American  casualties is as illusory as the pre-World War II theory that bombers would  obviate the need for large-scale ground warfare.    Twentieth-century warfare has not borne out the ambitions of the original  air-power theorists, or of the modern-day adherents to air power as a decisive  independent instrument. Air power has never proven to be the sledgehammer that  can crush an enemy's will and ability to conduct war. It is when air-power is  integrated as a component of a strategy that combines any number of resources  -- military, economic, diplomatic -- to achieve specified objectives that it  makes a real contribution to victory.

Between May and September, U.S. border guards from San Diego to Brownsville,  Tex., apprehended more than 435,000 suspected illegal immigrants, an increase  of almost 25% over the same period of 1988.    ""The numbers are going up, and we're concerned,"" said Duke Austin, spokesman in  Washington for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.    But the warning of increased illegal crossings is based upon statistics --  arrests along the border -- that, while widely repeated, are also widely  questioned. The apprehension numbers, critics argue, are on the rise because of  a range of factors -- among them INS staffing and priorities, seasonal shifts  in migration and changes in policy and law. Using arrest figures alone to claim  that illegal immigrants are once again streaming into the United States, these  critics say, can be misleading.    ""I think the figures' value has always been very problematic,"" said Wayne A.  Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego and  a leading researcher of immigration issues.    Yet the border arrest statistics have long been trumpeted by INS officials as  the single most effective indicator of illegal immigration. For decades, the  numbers have played a key role in U.S. immigration strategy. In the 1950s,  immigration authorities cited higher arrests to justify widespread sweeps of  suspected illegal migrants. In the early 1980s, rising arrests led to calls for  new controls, culminating in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.    That law, analysts say, has further eroded the reliability of arrest statistics  as an indicator of illegal immigration. Several provisions of the statute have  clearly had an impact on the border arrest totals, which at first declined  precipitously.    A major reason is the newly legalized status for more than 3 million amnesty  recipients -- almost 75% of them Mexican citizens and more than half residents  of California. That has meant that far fewer people have to cross the border  illegally; they can now go back and forth freely. Not surprisingly, the number  of legal crossings has risen considerably since 1986, and contributed to the  decline of illegal crossers.    In addition, the law gave new responsibilities to U.S. immigration authorities,  drawing some resources away from border enforcement, and leaving some agents in  the undermanned San Diego border force openly skeptical of claims that the law  was deterring illegal entry.    ""They (policy-makers) have to prove that the law they wanted is doing the job,""  said Steven Garcia, president of Local 1613 of the National Border Patrol  Council, the officers' union. ""If we had more agents, we'd definitely have more  arrests.""    INS officials, especially former commissioner Alan C. Nelson, were quick to  seize upon the post-1986 drop in arrests as evidence of the deterrent effect of  new penalties against employers who hire illegal aliens. The so-called employer  sanctions -- a centerpiece of the 1986 law -- were meant to dry up the illegal  migrant job market.    But skeptical researchers, aware of the lack of success of similar sanctions in  various U.S. states (including California) and in Europe, question the link.  Illegal aliens have easily managed to circumvent the new requirements through  use of false documents and other means, according to several studies.    Some critics, notably Jorge Bustamante, director of the College of the Northern  Border, a Tijuana-based research institution, have argued that the INS has  manipulated staffing in a deliberate effort to inflate or deflate the arrest  numbers to achieve its policy goals.    ""There's a manipulation from the top,"" said Bustamante, who also writes a  popular column for El Excelsior, the Mexico City daily. ""The agency has been  lying to the American people.""    U.S. officials deny any attempt to deceive. ""I think they (the numbers) are the  best barometer there is"" of illegal immigration, said Austin, the INS  spokesman.    One weakness, as INS officials concede, is that the apprehension numbers are  inflated. The statistics measure only arrests, so anyone arrested several  times, as frequently happens along the border, is counted with each arrest.    Nonetheless, the volume of arrests along the border is staggering, particularly  in the San Diego area, the single busiest crossing point along the border. On  Nov. 5, U.S. Border Patrol agents based here recorded 1,219 arrests of  migrants, or an average of about 50 per hour. More than 90% were Mexican  nationals. Among the 102 non-Mexicans apprehended were 41 Guatemalans, 36 El  Salvadorans, 11 Nicaraguans, four Hondurans, two Egyptians, two Colombians, two  Chinese and one citizen each from Bolivia, Belize, India and the Dominican  Republic.    Historically, authorities have used the arrest numbers as barometers of  unauthorized immigration from Mexico. After World War II, apprehensions of  illegal aliens began to double and triple annually, peaking at more than 1  million arrests in 1954.    Authorities took action, instituting the infamous ""Operation Wetback,""  arresting thousands. Caught in the net were many legal U.S. residents -- and  even U.S. citizens -- residing in Los Angeles and elsewhere. Some immigrants,  even though in the country legally, fled back to Mexico.    The ferocity of that operation has not been forgotten in Mexico, where the 1986  immigration law revisions sparked fears of similar actions.    In the years after ""Operation Wetback,"" the border arrest numbers gradually  declined, reaching a low of about 29,000 apprehensions in 1960. A sharp upward  trend began in the 1980s, as the Mexican economy worsened, and reached its apex  in 1986, when authorities recorded 1.6 million arrests of immigrants along the  border, a record. Again, as in the mid-1950s, there were calls for drastic  steps to stem the ""invasion."" The response this time was passage in October,  1986, of the immigration reform package.

0,FT942-3706 ,"FT942-3706 _AN-EFND1ABOFT 940614   FT  14 JUN 94 / Abu Nidal follower claims Lockerbie bombing      By MARK NICHOLSON      CAIRO   A Palestinian follower of Abu Nidal, one of the world's most wanted terrorists, claimed in a Lebanese court yesterday he himself had caused the bombing in 1988 of the Pan Am flight which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. Mr Youssef Shabaan, 29, made the claim during his trial on charges of assassinating a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut earlier this year. Mr Shabaan denies this charge, but told the court: 'I personally blew up the Lockerbie plane.' He added: 'I've told the investigating magistrate about it before, but my confession wasn't documented. I say it again now.' The claim would appear to cloud further the already murky Lockerbie saga, with which various countries and organisations have at one time or another been associated. These include Libya, Iran, Syria and a Damascus-based Palestinian group led by Mr Ahmed Djibril. The focus of official US and British investigations into the bombing remains fixed on Libya, where sanctions have been applied since 1992 for Tripoli's refusal to hand over for trial in Scotland or the US, two security agents blamed for bombing flight 103. Nevertheless, a British foreign office spokesman said Mr Shabaan's apparent confession would be investigated. Previous research has tended to distance Abu Nidal's group from the Lockerbie bombing. In his 1992 book Abu Nidal: A Gun for Hire, author Mr Patrick Seale says the 'world's most notorious Arab terrorist', whose real name is Sabri el-Banna, had 'no connection' with the Lockerbie bombing. But he nevertheless cites one of Abu Nidal's associates as quoting the guerrilla leader saying: 'We do have some involvement in this matter, but if anyone so much as mentions it, I will kill him with my own hands.' However, Mr Seale records Abu Nidal's 'more outrageous lies' as including improbable claims to have caused the Brighton bombing in 1984 and the fire at Bradford City football ground in 1985 in which scores of fans died. Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council split from the Palestine Liberation Organisation's mainstream Fatah wing in 1973 and is believed to have been behind scores of terrorist acts in the 1970s and 1980s, including an assassination attempt on Israel's ambassador to the UK in 1982 and the slaughter of 16 people in a shooting at Rome airport in 1985. He is wanted in at least 20 countries. Abu Nidal's whereabouts are also a puzzle. He is believed to have left Damascus for Tripoli in 1986, has been linked with Iraq, but the US state department last year cited reports that his group had found sanctuary in Sudan. Just five days ago Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, Libya's leader, claimed he thought Abu Nidal had died. Quoted by the state news agency, Col Gadaffi said: 'I believe he is not alive because I have appealed to him (to visit) and he didn't come.' Mr Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces militia during the country's 17-year civil war, was yesterday charged with involvement in the February bombing of a Beirut church in which 11 people were killed while at prayer. Mr Geagea's deputy, Mr Fouad Malek, and six other members of the LF were also indicted by a Lebanese prosecutor who has been investigating the bombing. All the accused face a possible death penalty if convicted. The indictment claims that one of the accused had direct contact with an Israeli intelligence officer before the bombing.

0,FT921-2385 ,"FT921-2385 _AN-CCSBEAFQFT 920319   FT  19 MAR 92 / Islamic Jihad says it bombed Israeli embassy      By JOHN BARHAM, LARA MARLOWE and HUGH CARNEGY      BUENOS AIRES, BEIRUT, JERUSALEM   ISLAMIC JIHAD, an underground Shia Moslem Lebanese group close to Iran, yesterday claimed responsibility for bombing the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in which at least 20 people died and 240 were injured. Yesterday rescue workers continued to comb the wreckage for two Israeli embassy officials and up to eight other victims believed still buried under the rubble. The group said in Beirut Tuesday's attack was carried out by a suicide bomber, named Abu Yasser, an Argentine convert to Islam, in reprisal for the Israeli assassination last month of Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the Hizbollah leader. Islamic Jihad is an off-shoot of the Lebanese Hizbollah, loyal to Iranian hardliner Hojatolislam Ali Akbar Mohtashemi. The claim, resonant with terms used over the past nine years in other Islamic Jihad claims of responsibility for bombings and kidnappings, demonstrated for the first time the ability of the fundamentalist cell to strike far outside the Middle East. The Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires yesterday denied that Tehran played any part in Tuesday's attack. It issued a statement 'categorically' denying any type of relation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and that event.' It said Iran 'lamented' the bombing and expressed its 'condolences' to the government and people of Argentina. Mr Jose Luis Manzano, Argentina's interior min-ister, blamed the attack on 'extremists from abroad who received logistical support' from local groups. Argentina has Latin America's biggest Jewish community, numbering about 300,000-400,000, as well as a large Arab community, whose most prominent member is President Carlos Menem, the son of Syrian immigrants. Argentine officials confirmed that a car bomb loaded with 100kg of explosives was used to virtually demolish the embassy. The attack is likely to prompt swift Israeli retaliation against targets in Lebanon. Even before the Islamic Jihad claim, senior Israeli officials said they would inflict 'painful punishment' on those who carried out the attack and those who sent them. Officials said the bombing would not cause Israel to withdraw from the Middle East peace talks. Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, said a 'Damascus-Tehran axis' supported acts like the embassy bombing and the killing earlier this month in a car bomb explosion in Ankara of an Israeli embassy security officer. In Damascus, President Hafez al-Assad denied Syria had been involved in either this bombing or any such acts and said he did not know who was responsible for the explosion.

The Italian government yesterday said the mafia was behind the attack, but did not exclude the possibility that other organisations could also be involved in a determined campaign of terror to destabilise the country. In yesterday's parliamentary debate a number of senators questioned whether dissident elements in the security services and former members of the P2 secret masonic lodge, behind terrorist acts during the 1970s and early 1980s, were involved in the incidents. The authorities believe they are up against a group or groups with a well-defined strategy, unafraid to take lives or attack priceless artistic treasures. Mr Nicola Mancino, the interior minister, told parliament the mafia had a hand in wanting to create a climate of tension. Their aim was to distract the authorities from their increasingly successful battle against organised crime. He did not rule out links with international organised crime The Italian cabinet yesterday agreed to provide L30bn (Pounds 13.16m) in immediate funds to ensure the Uffizi could open to the public as soon as possible, albeit on a limited basis. The authorities have revealed no hard proof of mafia involvement in this bombing or that in Rome on May 14. Mr Mancino said links existed between the car bombing in Florence and the one n Rome which injured 23 people. In both instances forensic experts have found traces of the same explosive material also used in another unexplained act of terrorism, the bombing of the Naples-Milan train on December 23, 1984 killing 15 and injuring 200. The interior minister said the Rome explosion occured on national police day while the Uffizi bomb went off on the day interior ministers were meeting to discuss combating the drugs trade. The Rome bombing was a message primarily directed against an Italian audience, while the Florence explosion was intended to produce reverberations world-wide, he suggested. He also maintained the bombings were too close together to be coincidental. The car used to carry more than 100kg of explosive was apparently stolen the day before, as was a second get-away vehicle. Mafia experts said this was contrary to normal mafia practice. In the four major terrorist acts since 1974, the courts have failed to pin final responsibility on anyone. Only this week the 50,000 page file was closed on the May 28, 1974 bombing in Brescia (8 dead, 90 injured) after eight separate inconclusive trials since 1978. In Florence yesterday unions organised a protest and a crowd of over 100,000 heard calls for people to refuse to be cowed by the threat of terrorism.

He said his role  consisted of tying the detonating wire in such a way that when  the targeted bus hit it the explosion would occur six seconds  later. Hulayhil explained that this type of denotation requires  no special expertise. He said he received bombing training in  al-Dinniyah several years ago.    Bilal al-Kasan, another suspect, said his role in that  attack  was to stand guard. He reported that the bombing was staged to  retaliate for events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to expel the  Christian clerics from al-Balamand.    All the suspects denied bombing tourist resorts.     "

0,FT934-12907 ,"FT934-12907 _AN-DJYCQAAIFT 931025   FT  25 OCT 93 / Bomb puts Ulster peace talks in doubt      By PHILIP STEPHENS and Our Belfast Correspondent   THE Hume-Adams initiative to end the fighting in Northern Ireland appeared doomed last night as Mr John Major led a fierce denunciation of the IRA's bombing of a busy Belfast street. As the death toll from Saturday's attack in the Protestant Shankill Road rose to 10, including one of the terrorists who planted the bomb, Mr Major ruled out early dialogue with the Republican Sinn Fein movement. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, announced they had postponed a meeting of the Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference on Wednesday. Mr Spring had been expected at that meeting to pass on to Sir Patrick details of the Hume-Adams plan. Sir Patrick is expected to make a House of Commons statement later today. British ministers expect that the London and Dublin governments will now press ahead with their own efforts to devise a new constitutional settlement to provide an umbrella for fresh talks between the legitimate political parties in the province. In the wake of Saturday's massacre Ulster Unionists demanded an end to the so-called peace initiative framed by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. Mr Hume called on the two governments to speed up their consideration of the proposals, which he said offered the best hope in 20 years of ending sectarian violence in the province. However, Mr Major, who is expected to hold talks with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, during Friday's European Community summit in Brussels, said the bombing had seriously undermined hopes for dialogue. Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Cyprus, Mr Major said he wanted one message from the IRA: 'We have given up violence for good.' He added: 'The message I want to hear is quite clear. It is quite simple. But I haven't heard it yet.' Apparently dismissing the Hume-Adams proposals, the prime minister said: 'I have read about it, I have heard about it, but I have not seen it.' Senior ministers added the bombing had reduced to 'practically zero' the already slim prospect that Mr Hume's efforts could lead to participation by Sinn Fein in talks to secure a political settlement in Ulster. One member of the cabinet said the government would be accused - and rightly so - of bowing to the terrorists if it opened contacts with an organisation which explicitly supported IRA terrorism. Mr Reynolds said the bombing was another atrocity which showed that the path of violence led nowhere. He said: 'All sides, even at this late stage, must desist from killing and allow the dialogue to develop between those who believe in peace.' Mr Adams said last night that the bombing had been 'wrong' after the IRA indicated that it had intended to give a warning before the bomb was detonated, but that it had exploded prematurely.

""We have been threatened for two years and these threats are  unworkable,"" General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of staff of  Bosnian Serb forces, told AFP. ""Before bombing the Serbs, they  would first have to distance them from Moslem positions,"" he  said, stressing the close proximity of Moslem and Serb positions  on the ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA meanwhile said as long as  French peacekeeping forces are in Bosnia, ""we can say with  certainty that the French will not support any military  intervention"" against the Serbs. ""These new NATO threats of  bombing are a storm in a teacup,"" the agency said.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels on  Tuesday said the Alliance was ready to launch if necessary --  under the authority of the UN Security Council -- air strikes  against Bosnian Serbs, notably to open up the airport in Tuzla  in the northeast and to give tactical support to allow some 300  Canadians blocked for six months by Serbs in the eastern Moslem  enclave of Srebrenica to be relieved. A NATO bombing would  force the Serbs to ""re-examine all concessions made to the  Moslems,"" Bosnian Serb strongman Radovan Karadzic had said  Monday [10 January]. The speaker of the Bosnian Serb  self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, meanwhile hailed  NATO's decision to ""give priority to the negotiating process"" on  Bosnia, without even bothering to comment on the new threats of  bombing.    Though NATO has on earlier occasions threatened possible air  strikes to free surrounded civilians, get through humanitarian  aid or protect UN troops, the Alliance has never carried out the  threats. On each occasion, Karadzic has reported that any  foreign bombing in Bosnian would turn each UN soldier into a  potential target for Serbian reprisal attacks. There was no  immediate reaction from Belgrade Tuesday on the NATO warnings  against its allies in Bosnia. But it was seen among Belgrade  circles as new pressure on Serbs prior to the negotiations on  Bosnia-Herzegovina due to resume on January 18 in Geneva with  the Moslems, Serbs and Croats to try to reach agreement.

These figures, according to Mr. Abiodun Adesola, the Acting  Press Secretary of the Agency, do not include the massive haul  of a special high grade heroin of 248.3 kilogrammes with a  conservative estimate of N1.2 billion ($300 million) imported  from Bangkok, Thailand. The cargo was intercepted at the Apapa  Wharf, in Lagos last December.    ""A cursory look at the figures showed that the number of  arrests and the quantity of seizures were far more in 1993 than  the previous years,"" Adesola stated in a statement yesterday.    He attributed the arrests and subsequent seizures to the  takeoff of two additional zonal commands at Warri and Maiduguri  which began operations last year.    According to him, marijuana, cultivated locally, with a  total  seizure of 7,461.744 kilogrammes maintained the number one slot  on the list of hard drugs seizures made last year.    This was followed by cocaine, 1,308.6697 kilogrammes,  heroin,  39.2862 kilogrammes and other psychotropic substances, 1.825  kilogrammes.    On quarterly basis, the fourth quarter of the year was the  period the highest number of arrests were made, 145 suspects in  all. Next was the first quarter with 121, followed by third and  second quarters with 100 and 87 suspects.    Adesola said the agency recorded her highest number of  arrests within the year under review in March with the arrest of  55 suspects. October and November followed with 52 and 47  arrested suspects.    However, the largest drug haul was recorded in February with  2,724.896 kilogrammes of hard drugs seizure.    This was followed by the 1,647.2515 kilogrammes seizure in  October while November of the same period under review was next  with 1,419.3283 kilogrammes.    ""One striking observation made in the Agency's operations,  last year was the seizure of psychotropic substances like  Amphatamines and pemoline, a development which may be attributed  to renewed vigilance on all types of hard drugs covered in the  mandate given to the Agency instead of only concentrating on  cocaine and heroin trafficker,"" he added.

For most of last week, the mood of US bond dealers seemed to suggest that it might be. It took the February employment data, which on Friday disclosed a surprisingly large increase in jobs last month, to inject a dose of cold reality into the market. The persistent 'upbeat' mood - which, in the previous week, had sent the long bond yield to its lowest level since 30-year bonds began to be issued regularly in the 1970s - became plain when trading began on Monday. In spite of disruption stemming from the World Trade Center blast and some cautious comments on short-term government borrowing plans from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new US treasury secretary, the long bond yield had fallen to 6.84 per cent by Monday evening from 6.9 per cent at the end of the previous week. Admittedly, there was nothing particularly alarmist in Mr Bentsen's remarks; he simply indicated that there would be no 'dramatic, radical shift' in the authorities' short-term borrowing plans. Nevertheless, traders had attributed part of the long bond's price rise to expectations that the quarterly 30-year auctions would diminish significantly in scale, and this might have depressed sentiment. So, too, might the temporary absence from the market of Cantor Fitzgerald, an important brokerage firm in the bond market and one of the casualties of the WTC explosion. But, having overcome these obstacles, the bond price rally duly continued for another three days. By Thursday evening, the long bond yield had dropped to 6.78 per cent, and yields on other Treasury issues had also declined. At this stage, there were few specific economic numbers to account for the rise - although weaker-than-expected data on 10-day car sales may have helped. In general, the rally appeared to result from growing confidence in the non-inflationary implications of the Clinton economic plan, and even some speculation about a further easing of interest rates by the authorities. Nevertheless, uneasiness about the speed and extent of the rally was beginning to spread among analysts - and Friday's release of the jobs numbers brought a perfect opportunity for the market to consolidate. The numbers themselves were certainly unexpected: there was an increase of 365,000 workers on non-farm payrolls in February, about three times the figure which pundits had been predicting, while the national unemployment rate edged down by a tenth of 1 per cent, to 7 per cent. With the weekend to reflect, analysts appeared to be striking a cautious note. Some pundits observed that manufacturing sector employment remains fairly weak, although it does appear that the recent pick-up in economic activity is finally translating into jobs. Although demand and supply considerations may underpin recent bond yields, many suspect that the steam will go out of the rally. The coming week, meanwhile, will be fairly light on new economic data. The February producer price index is due to be released on Friday, and expectations centre on a small increase - perhaps 0.3 per cent, after 0.2 per cent in January - due to higher food and energy prices. Predictions for February retail sales figures, out on Thursday, focus on a modest 0.1 per cent increase. Individual store sales results for the month have already displayed lacklustre trading, although retailers have blamed severe winter weather in many parts of the country.

Mr Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the complex, estimated that about two-thirds of the 50,000 people who normally work there had been displaced. He confirmed that it would be at least another week before the complex's 110-storey twin towers reopened, but said there was no fresh information on who was responsible for the bomb. Police said about 55 calls claiming responsibility had been received. Many of the hundreds of financial firms based in the complex had used the weekend to shift operations to other offices. Deloitte  Touche, the international accountancy firm which normally has 1,200 people working from seven floors of One, World Trade Centre, one of the towers, said it was temporarily housing them in its Broadway office. Deloitte said it had been allowed into the towers on Sunday to retrieve urgent files, and the only visible damage was from smoke. 'There's a fine soot on the computer equipment, but we won't know whether that's affected the hardware until we turn it on,' an official said. Salomon Brothers, the big US investment bank based in Seven, World Trade Centre, said yesterday it planned to convert one of its computer rooms into a temporary trading floor for 200 'displaced' Cantor Fitzgerald employees. Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, based in One, World Trade Centre, is the largest interdealer bond broker. Dean Witter Reynolds, the brokerage firm and largest single tenant of the complex, said it had relocated 4,500 employees to six company offices in New York and three more in New Jersey. It said its trading operations were running normally. US firms were not the only ones affected. Some subsidiaries of foreign financial services firms based in the twin towers also faced disruption. Commerzbank Capital Markets normally has about 50 people working out of One, World Trade Centre. They were attempting to move across West Street, to the bank's offices in the separate World Financial Centre complex. New York's futures exchanges, which share a single trading floor at Four, World Trade Centre, managed to open for abbreviated sessions yesterday, and most hope for business as usual today. However, the New York Mercantile Exchange, where most of the world's crude oil is priced, is again planning delayed openings and early closes. The New York Commodity Exchange operated in a make-shift environment, but spirits were high on the trading floors. Traders particularly enjoyed the fresh air being pumped onto the trading floor to compensate for lost air conditioning. The New York commodity exchanges provide the world's largest markets for crude oil, coffee, sugar and cotton and are important trading centres for precious metals such as gold and platinum. World prices for these commodities are set in New York, making it essential that trading time is not lost. Meanwhile, early morning commuters to the WTC found transport running almost normally. The Port Authority stressed that there had been no structural damage to the twin towers. New York state officials said a Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.5m) programme had been set up to assist small and medium-sized businesses displaced as a result of the blast. Mr Richard Leone, chairman of the Port Authority board, said: 'Obviously, we're suspending rent.' Insurers brace for bomb damage claims, Page 3   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The bombing was condemned as 'revolting' by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, reflecting British concern that loyalist violence could threaten the open-ended IRA ceasefire announced last month. Mr Pat Doherty, a senior official of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, accused the UVF of trying to force the Dublin government to abandon direct contacts with republicans. 'The loyalist hope is that fear of the conflict being brought 'down here' will scupper the peace process,' he said. Mr John Hume, leader of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, said he was confident the IRA would not retaliate because Sinn Fein's leadership was 'totally committed' to the peace process. Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, said the attack would not deflect the Dublin government from its strategy of consolidating the republican ceasefire by talking directly to Sinn Fein. British officials believe the US is likely to grant a visa to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, at the Irish government's request, as part of the Irish strategy of drawing Sinn Fein into mainstream politics. However, Downing Street believes President Clinton and administration officials will avoid a direct meeting with Mr Adams for fear of weakening unionist support for the peace process. The Dublin bomb exploded as an express train from Belfast was pulling into Connolly station in the city centre. Two women were slightly hurt. Irish police said the explosion was caused by a detonator which failed to ignite a 2kg explosive charge, suggesting that casualties could have been higher. The UVF, which bombed a Dublin pub three months ago, said it had planted bombs in seven other locations in the city. None was found. The bombing reflects loyalist suspicion of a deal between Britain and the IRA, and confirms that Protestant terrorists are prepared to take their campaign to the Irish Republic. The Combined Loyalist Military Command, representing the UVF and the Ulster Freedom Fighters said last week a loyalist ceasefire would depend on assurances that no deal had been done. Loyalists are also concerned about the implications of a 'framework' document for Northern Ireland's future being drawn up by the British and Irish governments as part of the peace process.

Describing the ring as ""one of the nation's largest and most sophisticated  alien smuggling operations,"" Immigration and Naturalization Service Western  Regional Commissioner Harold Ezell said he expected that the Tuesday raid --  which also netted 21 illegal aliens -- would soon be followed by the arrests of  other ""key principals"" of the group in New York.    INS officials said there was accumulating evidence that the ring broken up  Tuesday had worked in concert with other transcontinental smuggling operations,  suggesting that the methods employed by ""coyotes"" who shuttle illegal workers  on commercial flights are more sophisticated than initially believed.    ""Every smuggler we've picked up (in the last two weeks) had some connection  with this organization,"" said INS Los Angeles District Director Ernest  Gustafson.    Before Tuesday's raid, INS agents had arrested eight other suspected smugglers  since the first widespread arrests of immigrants began in late February at Los  Angeles International Airport and air terminals in Atlanta and New York.    Records seized during recent arrests and interviews with detained illegal  aliens indicate that smugglers from several independent rings have been working  together to link up with immigrant clients, Gustafson said. Documents found  Tuesday showed that the South-Central smuggling ring brought in more than  $500,000 in recent weeks.    ""These groups are sharing referrals, money and specialties,"" Gustafson said.    Immigration officials estimated that before the recent wave of arrests, the  smuggling ring had flown ""several hundred"" aliens to destinations on the East  Coast and in the Midwest. Among them were large groups of immigrants from the  Dominican Republic and Brazil -- countries that had not been previously  considered major ""sending areas"" of undocumented aliens to the United States.    INS spokesman Ron Rogers said that the South-Central group was responsible for  transporting ""a majority"" of the 79 illegal aliens who were arrested Feb. 27 at  Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport on their way to New York, the first  of what has proven to be a series of large-scale arrests on airplanes and in  drop houses.    Agents from the INS' so-called ""Coyote Busters,"" a newly formed task force  aimed at smugglers of undocumented workers, began surveillance three days ago  on the one-story stucco drop house in the 500 block of West 85th Street after  receiving information from several of the immigrants arrested in Atlanta that  it had been used to temporarily house them, Rogers said.      Surrounded the House    At about 7 p.m. Tuesday night, INS agents surrounded the three-room house. In  the kitchen, they found eight illegal aliens hemmed in around a stove, frying  potatoes. The others were wedged into a tiny bedroom.    ""You wouldn't leave an animal in those kind of unsanitary conditions,"" Ezell  said.    The INS commissioner, who joined other immigration officials on the raid, said  that one elderly immigrant told authorities she was held in the drop house for  10 days. The woman reported that after paying the smugglers, she rode buses  north from Mexico City to Tijuana and then to the border. After being led with  others across the crossing point, Ezell said, her group was driven north from  San Diego to Los Angeles.    A fee schedule seized at the house listed the payments required from the  immigrants for the services they required. The fees ranged from $950 to $6,000.    ""It all depended on what you needed,"" Rogers said. ""If they took care of  everything, it could get pretty steep.""      Use 'Redeye' Flights    Typically, Gustafson said, the smugglers would wait until the late night  ""redeye"" flights to order their tickets because the prices were cheap and there  were fewer security and airport administrative personnel to notice their large  group of immigrant clients.    After the recent wave of arrests began, the smuggling operation tried to change  its tactics. Several telephone numbers taken from arrested immigrants in New  York tipped off the agency that the smugglers were planning to fly aliens from  Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and then on to New York -- avoiding the closely  watched Los Angeles-to-Atlanta-to-New York route.    The bolstered presence of INS agents at Los Angeles airports, Ezell said, has  kept illegal aliens from leaving many of the 30 to 40 suspected drop houses in  Southern California. INS officials added that in addition to the Tuesday  arrests, they have begun surveillance at a dozen other drop houses in  preparation for similar raids.    The four men arrested and held on suspicion of smuggling were identified as  Hector Gomez-Miranda, 23, of Guatemala; Martin Garcia-Saldana, 18, of Mexico;  Orlando Navarete-Leones, 23, of El Salvador and Dubon Serrano, 21, also from El  Salvador. All were described as ""middlemen"" in the operation. The 21 illegal  aliens will be allowed to return voluntarily to Mexico or face a deportation  hearing.    INS officials also announced that four Mexican immigrants were arrested at Los  Angeles International Airport Wednesday on their way to take a flight to  Chicago. The arrests raised the total number of illegal aliens apprehended at  Los Angeles-area airports to 439 since Feb. 28.      Photo, The kitchen of a South-Central L.A.

INS spokesman Ron Rogers said that the South-Central group was responsible for  transporting ""a majority"" of the 79 illegal aliens who were arrested Feb. 27 at  Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport on their way to New York, the first  of what has proven to be a series of large-scale arrests on airplanes and in  drop houses.    Agents from the INS' so-called ""Coyote Busters,"" a newly formed task force  aimed at smugglers of undocumented workers, began surveillance three days ago  on the one-story stucco drop house in the 500 block of West 85th Street after  receiving information from several of the immigrants arrested in Atlanta that  it had been used to temporarily house them, Rogers said.      Surrounded the House    At about 7 p.m. Tuesday night, INS agents surrounded the three-room house. In  the kitchen, they found eight illegal aliens hemmed in around a stove, frying  potatoes. The others were wedged into a tiny bedroom.    ""You wouldn't leave an animal in those kind of unsanitary conditions,"" Ezell  said.    The INS commissioner, who joined other immigration officials on the raid, said  that one elderly immigrant told authorities she was held in the drop house for  10 days. The woman reported that after paying the smugglers, she rode buses  north from Mexico City to Tijuana and then to the border. After being led with  others across the crossing point, Ezell said, her group was driven north from  San Diego to Los Angeles.    A fee schedule seized at the house listed the payments required from the  immigrants for the services they required. The fees ranged from $950 to $6,000.    ""It all depended on what you needed,"" Rogers said. ""If they took care of  everything, it could get pretty steep.""      Use 'Redeye' Flights    Typically, Gustafson said, the smugglers would wait until the late night  ""redeye"" flights to order their tickets because the prices were cheap and there  were fewer security and airport administrative personnel to notice their large  group of immigrant clients.    After the recent wave of arrests began, the smuggling operation tried to change  its tactics. Several telephone numbers taken from arrested immigrants in New  York tipped off the agency that the smugglers were planning to fly aliens from  Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and then on to New York -- avoiding the closely  watched Los Angeles-to-Atlanta-to-New York route.    The bolstered presence of INS agents at Los Angeles airports, Ezell said, has  kept illegal aliens from leaving many of the 30 to 40 suspected drop houses in  Southern California. INS officials added that in addition to the Tuesday  arrests, they have begun surveillance at a dozen other drop houses in  preparation for similar raids.    The four men arrested and held on suspicion of smuggling were identified as  Hector Gomez-Miranda, 23, of Guatemala; Martin Garcia-Saldana, 18, of Mexico;  Orlando Navarete-Leones, 23, of El Salvador and Dubon Serrano, 21, also from El  Salvador. All were described as ""middlemen"" in the operation. The 21 illegal  aliens will be allowed to return voluntarily to Mexico or face a deportation  hearing.    INS officials also announced that four Mexican immigrants were arrested at Los  Angeles International Airport Wednesday on their way to take a flight to  Chicago. The arrests raised the total number of illegal aliens apprehended at  Los Angeles-area airports to 439 since Feb. 28.      Photo, The kitchen of a South-Central L.A.

They described the unrest as the most serious in Libya for at least seven years. Details of the uprising remain patchy, but diplomats quoting 'reliable sources' in Libya say military units in as many as five centres staged a violent rebellion early last week, which seems to have been crushed with the help of the Libyan air force. Libyan officials, who habitually suppress sensitive information, denied any such unrest. But diplomats say there is evidence of sizeable uprisings on October 11-14 at military installations at Misratah, Tarhua, Ghariyiah, Beni Walid and Brak - towns to the south and west of the capital, Tripoli. They reported explosions at military depots, airforce bombing of roads, and witnesses seeing numerous casualties in several hospitals. Several diplomats said the violence appeared the worst since clashes between the army and dissident factions in 1986, after the US bombing of Tripoli. The diplomats spoke of a subsequent purge of senior officers within the Libyan military. 'We understand people in the government were quite rattled  -several old military hands appear to have taken part,' said one diplomat. Others said members of Col Gadaffi's security escort had been among the casualties. The reports converge with earlier claims by the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, the exiled opposition group, claiming a simultaneous uprising took place last week involving up to 2,000 mutinous troops at Misratah alone in what they claimed was an attempted coup d'etat. The reports are also circumstantially supported by a speech given by Col Gaddafi in Misratah on October 17, in which he condemned 'treachery' against the regime at some length, and said in reference to those who 'betrayed' Libya to the Italian colonisers, that: 'The traitors of October 1911 are like the traitors of October 1993' and should be 'eliminated'. He made no direct allusion to any uprising. The cause of the unrest is also unclear, although most diplomats and other analysts suggested it may have arisen indirectly out of the international pressure on Libya over its alleged role in the 1988 bombing of a PanAm aircraft over Lockerbie in Scotland. They said deep internal divisions over whether to extradite two Libyan secret service agents accused by the US and Britain over the Lockerbie bombing have aggravated intra-tribal rivalry in the country.

He said in  Pretoria the arrests were made after more than six weeks of  intensive invstigations into a series of far-rightwing terror  attacks in the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal.    Police on Monday arrested five suspects linked to  far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and  others in Welkom.    The SA Police over the weekend also arrested seven people,  including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army  members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on  a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, at the weekend,  Mr Kriel said. Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were  seized when the arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni and near  the scene of the crime in Richard's Bay.    Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal  and  the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the  police.    Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress  and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said.    During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun  at  members of the police through a closed door. A policeman,  Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest but escaped death  because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr  Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm. He was  under police guard in hospital.    ""These arrests, and many others before them, explode the  myth  cultivated by Mr Nelson Mandela and the African National  Congress [ANC] that the SA Police is soft on rightwing  terrorism. ""Once again the SA police have demonstrated that  they will act without fear or favour,"" said Mr Kriel. ""These  arrests should also serve as a serious warning to both right and  left-wing extremists that the SA Police will not for a moment  hesitate to act against anyone who breaks the law, regardless of  political affiliation.""    Mr Kriel believed it was time Mr Mandela paid constructive  and credible attention to his ""criminal self-defence units,  which are trained by MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, [Spear of the Nation  -- armed wing of the ANC]"". If Mr Mandela was interested in  fair play, he would apologise to State President F W de Klerk  and the SA Police for his recent unfounded insults. ""However,  knowing Mr Mandela, this may be too much to ask, considering  that objectivity is not one of his strong points,"" Mr Kriel said.     "

""I think people are beginning to look at the  consequences of getting into a car and driving under the influence of any  substance. Law enforcement efforts, especially sobriety checkpoints, have had  an impact.""    Some jurisdictions, such as the California Highway Patrol, reported higher  numbers of drunk-driving arrests compared to last year. Other departments  reported a decrease, which they said may reflect more caution on the part of  drivers. Officials said these two trends are not contradictory -- fewer drunk  drivers are on the highways but concentrated efforts, such as those of the CHP,  sometimes result in a higher number of arrests.    Virtually all agreed that getting drunk and drug-influenced drivers off the  highway was a key to the county's relatively safe Christmas.    The Christmas holiday death toll was lower than it has been for the past five  years, according to the Orange County coroner's office. The county had four  highway traffic deaths during Christmas 1986, five in 1987, seven in 1988 and  five in 1989, the coroner reported.    Meanwhile, during the five-day Christmas weekend this year, 404 people were  arrested on drunk-driving charges in Orange County. The CHP arrested 152 of the  total, and the remaining arrests were by all other police jurisdictions in the  county. The CHP said its drunk-driving arrests in the county this year were up  36% compared to last year.    Lt. Richard J. Olson, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department,  said comparison data is not available for all other police jurisdictions  because he began assembling holiday drunk-driving arrest statistics this year  for the first time. Olson, however, said he thinks the number of drunk-driving  arrests is up this year compared to other Christmas holidays.    The sole traffic fatality between 6 p.m. Friday and 12:01 a.m. Wednesday was  the death of a 19-year-old Fountain Valley man at 5:30 a.m. Saturday on the San  Diego Freeway at the Magnolia Street on-ramp. Deputy Coroner William King said  the youth, Major J. Johnson, lost control of the car and crashed into a call  box. King said there was no indication that the accident was alcohol- or  drug-related.    Arresting alcohol-impaired drivers has been easier for police this Christmas  season. A new state law that became effective Jan. 1 lowered the legal  blood-alcohol level from the 0.10 to 0.08.    Some cities, including Fullerton, reported that increased efforts to halt drunk  drivers had led to higher arrest totals this year. Lt. Bud Lathrop said  Fullerton had 534 driving-under-the-influence arrests in 1989 and has made 619  such arrests so far this year.    But in Garden Grove, police reported that a sobriety checkpoint on Saturday  night stopped about 1,100 cars and did not find a single drunk driver.    Garden Grove Traffic Officer Fred McLean said the absence of drunk drivers at  the checkpoint indicated that people are being more cautious about drinking.  ""It seems that if there's a lot of publicity that there's going to be a  checkpoint, more people are using designated drivers,"" he said.    In Huntington Beach, police arrested 11 suspected drunk driver during the  five-day holiday. Lt. Ed McErlain said he had no number for comparison purposes  but believes that the number of arrests is low compared to other years. He too  said this is a sign that fewer drunks are behind the wheel.    ""We like to think that our enforcement, combined with education efforts, are  working,"" McErlain said.    ""The thing you like is never getting (drunk-driving accidents) to begin with,""  added Sgt. Richard S. Zschoche of the Anaheim Police Traffic Bureau. ""You're  looking for the deterrent factor.""    Anaheim was among Orange County cities that stepped up roving police patrols  looking for inebriated drivers during the holidays. ""We started this on  Thanksgiving . . . and will continue right through New Year's,"" Zschoche said.    The county's hundreds of Alcoholics Anonymous chapters aided the efforts to  keep drunk drivers off the streets by holding more meetings than during  non-holiday weeks. Some AA groups held what they called ""marathon,"" or  round-the-clock, meetings so that people with alcohol problems had a place to  go regardless of the time of day.    Ron LaPorte, manager of alcoholism programs for the county's Health Care  Agency, said Wednesday that he feels certain that education and prevention  efforts are now paying off.    ""I absolutely believe that we are having an impact,"" LaPorte said. ""I also  believe that attitudes and social norms about drinking are changing. It's not  considered cool or a lot of fun now to get drunk during the holidays. And  people are being made aware of the consequences, such as getting arrested.  People are starting to think a little bit differently about intoxicants and  celebrations.""    Edelman, manager of the Health Care Agency's drug programs, agreed that  education efforts are helping keep ""high"" drivers off the road. ""I think we're  beginning to turn the tide and reach young people,"" he said.    Some cab companies reported Wednesday that they are taking part in a holiday  program to keep drunk drivers off the street. Bill Craig, manager of Coast  Yellow Cab, said that at participating taverns and restaurants, the bartenders  worried about a patron's ability will hand out a coupon good for a free cab  ride within a 20-mile radius. Craig said his company has been getting up to 50  such calls a day since Friday, when this year's holiday program began.    Edelman said the change in societal views about alcohol and drugs and the  diverse efforts to prevent impaired drivers are now bearing fruit in Orange  County.    ""I do believe it's beginning to pay off,"" he said. ""I think we're beginning to  see things turn around.""

People are starting to think a little bit differently about intoxicants and  celebrations.""    Edelman, manager of the Health Care Agency's drug programs, agreed that  education efforts are helping keep ""high"" drivers off the road. ""I think we're  beginning to turn the tide and reach young people,"" he said.    Some cab companies reported Wednesday that they are taking part in a holiday  program to keep drunk drivers off the street. Bill Craig, manager of Coast  Yellow Cab, said that at participating taverns and restaurants, the bartenders  worried about a patron's ability will hand out a coupon good for a free cab  ride within a 20-mile radius. Craig said his company has been getting up to 50  such calls a day since Friday, when this year's holiday program began.    Edelman said the change in societal views about alcohol and drugs and the  diverse efforts to prevent impaired drivers are now bearing fruit in Orange  County.    ""I do believe it's beginning to pay off,"" he said. ""I think we're beginning to  see things turn around.""

By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Already, U.S. authorities have begun a renewed sounding of the alarm bells.  After 2 1/2 years of steady declines following passage of the sweeping 1986  immigration reform package, arrests of undocumented foreign nationals along the  U.S.-Mexico border have begun to surge, signaling a possible renewed wave of  illegal entries, according to officials.    Between May and September, U.S. border guards from San Diego to Brownsville,  Tex., recorded more than 435,000 apprehensions of the undocumented, a jump of  almost one-quarter over the same period in 1988.    ""The numbers are going up, and we're concerned,"" said Duke Austin, spokesman in  Washington for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. ""It's something  we're watching closely.""    But the warning of an emerging trend is based on statistics -- arrests along  the border -- that, although widely repeated, also are widely questioned. The  arrest numbers, critics argue, are so volatile because of a range of factors --  among them INS staffing and priorities, seasonal shifts in migration, and  changes in policy and law -- that using them to buttress any point can be  highly misleading.    ""I think the figures' value has always been very problematic,"" said Wayne A.  Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego and  a leading researcher of immigration issues.    Yet the border arrest statistics have long been trumpeted by INS officials as  the single most effective indicator of illegal immigration. For decades, the  numbers have served a central role in U.S. immigration strategy. During the  1950s, as in the 1980s, rising arrests led inexorably to crackdowns and calls  for new controls.    The numbers' always-suspect reliability, analysts say, has eroded further since  passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the most  far-reaching overhaul of U.S. immigration law in two decades. Several  provisions of that statute have clearly had a direct impact on border arrests,  which dropped after passage of the law until the recent surge.    Among other things, the law's legalization or amnesty provisions resulted in  more legal border crossings, possibly contributing to a parallel decline in  illegal entries. And the law gave new responsibilities to U.S. immigration  authorities, drawing some personnel away from border enforcement.    INS officials, especially former commissioner Alan C. Nelson, have been quick  to seize upon the post-1986 drop in arrests as evidence that new penalties  against employers who hire undocumented workers successfully stemmed illegal  immigration. The so-called employer sanctions -- a centerpiece of the 1986 law  -- were meant to dry up the undocumented job market.    But skeptical researchers, aware of the lack of success of similar sanctions in  various U.S. states (including California) and in Europe, say the agency's  logic is specious. Undocumented workers have easily managed to circumvent the  new requirements by using false documents and other means, according to several  studies.    Some critics, notably Jorge Bustamante, director of the College of the Northern  Frontier, a Tijuana-based research institution, have argued that the INS has  manipulated staffing in a deliberate effort to inflate or deflate the numbers  and achieve its policy goals. Thus, Bustamante suggests, when INS officials  sought passage of immigration reform laws, they conducted an all-out effort to  bolster arrests leading up to 1986, when the new statute was finally passed.  Once the law was approved, Bustamante said, border enforcement was apparently  relaxed, showing a drop-off in arrests.    ""There's a manipulation from the top,"" Bustamante said. ""The agency has been  lying to the American people.""    INS officials defend the integrity of the figures. Although they acknowledge  that border enforcement was increased before 1986, contributing to a steep rise  in arrests, authorities say that the number of border enforcement man hours  continued to increase during 1987, when arrests dropped dramatically. ""I think  they (the numbers) are the best barometer there is"" of illegal immigration,  said Austin, the agency spokesman. ""It has its weaknesses, but I don't think  there's a better number.""    Some independent analysts say the numbers are of some use, although corrections  must be factored in for swings in INS border staffing, repeat arrests, seasonal  shifts in migration (spring and summer are the most popular months), and a host  of other factors. The figures correlate to certain events, such as the collapse  of the Mexican economy in 1982, which triggered a huge emigration, noted Frank  D. Bean, a demographer with The Urban Institute, a Washington-based policy  research organization. Arrests began a sharp climb after 1982.    ""There are two points of view,"" noted Bean, who has done extensive research  into the figures as part of the institute's continuing examination of the  effects of the 1986 immigration reform law. ""On the one hand are INS personnel  who have oversold the (numbers') value, saying they are an almost perfect  indicator of flows across the border. Another point of view says that these  things are worthless, that they don't tell you anything. . . . I think the  truth is somewhere in between, that (the numbers') do tell us something of some  use.""    Just how the 1986 immigration statute contributed to the lower apprehension  numbers that followed its passage remains a matter of fierce debate. It is a  debate that goes to the heart of any effort to gauge the effectiveness of the  1986 law, which was largely intended to stem illegal immigration from Mexico.    Judging the effectiveness of the 1986 immigration law in deterring undocumented  border-crossers can be a daunting task. By definition, illegal immigration is a  difficult phenomenon to measure. Fearing detection and possible deportation,  undocumented foreigners typically avoid contact with local and federal  authorities.    The varying estimates surrounding the number of illegal immigrants residing in  the United States reflect the confusion. The INS now says that there are  perhaps 3 million undocumented foreigners, but officials acknowledge that the  number is guesswork.    Most undocumented people are Mexican citizens arriving overland through the  almost-2,000 mile-long border; a large number of Central Americans and others  also use the border to enter the United States clandestinely.    The apprehension numbers are by nature inflationary. The statistics measure  only arrests, so anyone arrested multiple times, as frequently happens along  the border, is counted on each occasion.    Nonetheless, the volume of arrests along the border is astounding. That is  particularly so in the San Diego area, the single busiest crossing point along  the border, which provides a direct corridor to the immigrant job centers of  Los Angeles and elsewhere in California.    Take a recent, typical day: Last Sunday, Nov. 5.    U.S. Border Patrol agents in San Diego recorded arrests of 1,219 illegal  immigrants, or more than 50 per hour. Of those, 1,117, or 91%, were Mexican  nationals; most signed forms admitting they were here illegally and were  returned to Tijuana, usually within a day. Among the remaining 102 apprehended  were 41 Guatemalans, 36 El Salvadorans, 11 Nicaraguans, 4 Hondurans, 2  Egyptians, 2 Colombians, 2 Chinese and 1 citizen each from Bolivia, Belize,  India and the Dominican Republic. Non-Mexicans apprehended may enter a range of  legal proceedings, including the deportation process.    Despite the large numbers of arrests, U.S. officials acknowledge that they  apprehend only a fraction of those attempting to cross.    In seeking to track the law's impacts, INS officials, particularly  ex-commissioner Nelson, turned once again to to border apprehension statistics,  that familiar benchmark. However, many have challenged the INS's efforts to  link the post-1986 declines in border arrests to the new sanctions against  employers who hire undocumented workers.    There is widespread agreement, however, that the 1986 law has likely affected  the statistics in a variety of ways, some of them still not understood.    In one major development, the newly legalized status for 3 million amnesty  recipients -- almost 75% of them Mexican citizens and more than half residents  of California -- has meant that many fewer people have to cross the border  illegally; those 3 million people can now go back and forth freely. Not  surprisingly, then, the number of legal crossings via ports of entry between  California and Mexico have risen considerably since 1986, paralleling the  decline in border arrests of illegal border-crossers.    In addition, some Border Patrol resources have been shifted since passage of  the law to assist in enforcing the new penalties against employers who hire  undocumented workers. And, in San Diego, a hiring freeze has left U.S. Border  Patrol staffing at a four-year low. Many agents, faced with hundreds of  border-crossers every evening, are openly skeptical of INS claims that the 1986  law is deterring illegal entry.    ""They (superiors) have to prove that the law they wanted is doing the job,""  said Steven Garcia, an agent with 10 years of experience in San Diego who is  president of Local 1613 of the National Border Patrol Council, the agents'  union. ""Four or five years ago, we never had a hundred or more people running  across the border together. . . . If we had more agents, we'd definitely have  more arrests.""    Whatever the true meaning the arrest figures, INS officials continue to cite  them in an effort to evaluate trends at the border. They have done so for more  than half a century.    The numbers have been in use since the Border Patrol, a uniformed arm of the  INS, was founded in in 1924 with 459 ""former mounted guards, policemen,  sheriffs, gunslingers of various types"" and others, according to 1974 INS  in-house history of the patrol. In 1925, agents arrested some 22,000 persons  for immigration-law violations.    Since then, authorities have used the numbers as evidence of waves of illegal  immigration from Mexico. After World War II, apprehensions of the undocumented  began to double and triple annually, peaking at more than 1 million arrests in  fiscal 1954. Then, as now, illegal immigrants were blamed for a range of  problems in U.S. border areas and immigrant communities. ""The invasion by  hordes of illegal aliens continued and with them came tremendously increased  rates of crime in areas where they congregated,"" said the INS history.    Authorities took action, instituting the infamous ""Operation Wetback,""  arresting thousands of undocumented people and sending them back to Mexico.  Caught in the web were many legal U.S. residents -- and even U.S. citizens --  residing in Los Angeles and elsewhere. Some fled out of fear. Researchers have  found widespread abuse.    ""After the backbone of the wetback invasion was broken in California, task  force operations were shifted to South Texas,"" the INS article noted.    The ferocity of that operation has not been forgotten in Mexico, where the 1986  immigration law revisions sparked fears of similar actions.    In the years after ""Operation Wetback,"" the border arrest numbers gradually  declined, reaching a low of about 29,000 apprehensions in 1960. An sharp upward  trend began in the 1980s, as the Mexican economy worsened, and reached its apex  in 1986, when authorities recorded 1.6 million arrests of illegal immigrants  along the U.S.-Mexico border, a new record. Again, as in the mid-1950s, there  were calls for drastic steps to stem the ""invasion."" Those cries culminated in  congressional passage in October 1986 of the immigration reform package.

Police said the investigators were led to the three-story  shophouse by a water tank shop on Ramkhamhaeng Road whose  address was on the side of the bomb found on board a rented  truck in front of the Lumphini Police Station on Thursday.  [passage omitted]    Police said they questioned staff at the water tank shop who  confirmed they had delivered two tanks to a house on Sukhaphiban  Road at the order of a foreign buyer.    Police said they found a receipt which showed the fertilizer  had been ordered from a shop in Thon Buri.    The shop had been rented to a Mideast-looking man who spoke  Thai about four months ago, police said.    Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said  investigators have identified the Mideast-looking man who drove  the truck and rented the shophouse.    He said the man had rented the house since August last year  and had transferred money to the house owner to pay for the rent  from a province in the South.    Interpol has already been contacted to look for the man who  might have left the country, he said.    Up to four foreigners lived in the house, he said, but the  landlord believed they had now left Thailand.    Pol. [Police] Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said, based on the contents  and materials used to make the bomb and the items found  yesterday at the house, police and intelligence agencies decided  the terrorists belonged to the same group which exploded a bomb  at the World Trade Center in New York.    The bomb used at the World Trade Center on February 26 last  year was said to be made of the same concoction known among U.S.  Federation Bureau of Investigation agents as a ""witches' brew"".  [passage omitted]    Chaiyasit said he was ""50 percent"" sure the terrorists are  still in the Kingdom. [passage omitted]    He said the information given by the owner of the truck, the  water tank shop staff and the motorcyclist indicates the  Mideast-looking man who rented the truck and bought the water  tanks was the same person.    The man communicated with his hands and spoke both English  and Arabic.    Pol. Lt. Gen.

In Pretoria, he said the  arrests were made after more than six weeks of intensive  investigations into a series of far-rightwing terror attacks in  the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal.    On Monday, police arrested five suspects linked to  far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and  others in Welkom.    Over the weekend, the SA Police arrested seven people,  including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army  members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on  a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, Mr Kriel said.  Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were seized when the  arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni, and near the scene of  the crime in Richard's Bay.    Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal  and  the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the  police.    Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress  and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said.    During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun  at  members of the police through a closed door. A policeman,  Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest, but escaped death  because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr  Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm.

The Lebanese criminal court pronounced Yasir Shuraydah, 34,  not guilty in the 1984 murder of Mustafa al-'Ashiq in Germany.  Another Palestinian, Ghassan Ayyub, was also cleared in the  case.    Germany has demanded Shuraydah's extradition from Lebanon as  part of investigations into the April 5, 1986 bombing of the La  Belle discotheque in west Berlin frequented by US troops. There  is no extradition treaty between Beirut and Bonn.    Under Lebanese law a foreigner living in Lebanon can be  tried  for a crime committed in this country or abroad and any  extradition measure can only be decided by the cabinet after a  verdict is pronounced.    The Lebanese authorities have not charged Shuraydah in  connection with the La Belle attack and he has denied any  involvement in the bombing that killed three people and wounded  230 others.    Washington blamed the attack on Libya. Ten days later US  bombers blasted the headquarters of Libyan leader Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli.    Shuraydah's lawyer, Muna al-Samrah, said that he was still  being held at the Rumiyah prison, east of Beirut, where Ayyub is  also detained. She said the pair were cleared of al-'Ashiq's  murder ""because there is no proof that they were guilty.""    Shuraydah, who along with Ayyub comes from the 'Ayn  al-Hulwah  Palestinian refugee camp on the eastern outskirts of the port  city of Sidon, was arrested here in 1991 in connection with a  string of murders, attempted murder and burglaries.

A series of arrests  was made last night in Asti and Piedmont as part of the inquiry  undertaken by the Italian and Swiss police, revealed the  carabinieri during a press conference.    The police operation undertaken jointly by the Italian and  Swiss investigators and dubbed ""San Jose""--the name of the  Colombian town from where the cocaine leaves--led to a series of  arrests in Italy (Piedmont and Lombardy) and Ticino. Over a  month ago, a native of Lugano and his companion were the first  to be arrested in Asti.    On 18 February, the Ticino police put the handcuffs on one  of  its own men, a 40-year-old corporal who worked at the Agno  airport. The man immediately admitted participating in the  international trafficking of some 150 kg of cocaine, an amount  that rose to 500 kg a few days later. On 24 February, it was  the turn of a Lugano bar owner to be arrested. Then, on 2  March, a 30-year-old Italian employed by the airline Crossair  was apprehended.    On Wednesday, a few hours before the last arrests that took  place Wednesday night in Asti, the Ticino police announced the  arrest of a 54-year-old Italian man in a Lugano hotel. The  police asked the press not to report the story until further  notice. The silence was broken Thursday by the Italian  investigators, who revealed the identity of the man arrested in  Lugano. He is from Milan and is considered the right-hand man  to the head of the organization, a 28-year-old Colombian.    With these latest arrests, operation ""San Jose"" has put 18  people behind bars in Italy and Ticino. Only five kilograms of  cocaine were seized. The trafficking operation, which has been  going on since 1991, involved some 2,000 kg of drugs with a  value of 4.5 million Swiss francs.    After being exported from Colombia, the cocaine was  transported by ship to Savona, near Genoa, or by airplane with  stopovers in Bogota, Santo Domingo, Madrid, Zurich, and Agno.  The drugs that arrived in the Lugano airport were taken over by  the crooked policeman and thus avoided customs checks.    While the prosecutor, Jacques Ducry, who is in charge of the  inquiry in Ticino, said Thursday that ""for the time being there  is no link between the arrests in Ticino and those in Italy,""  the names of the Ticino inhabitants implicated were given to the  Italian police during the press conference in Asti.

Al-Qadhdhafi told journalists late Monday that he had agreed  with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak ""to transfer the two  suspects to Egypt"" during meetings between the two leaders in  Libya.    ""Egypt would then be responsible for them and would  guarantee  to transfer them to the place fixed for their trial,""  al-Qadhdhafi said, stressing that any trial would have to be  ""elsewhere other than the United States and Great Britain.""    The two men are accused of being behind the bombing of a  Pan-Am Boeing which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in  December 1988, killing 270 people.    Al-Qadhdhafi said an Arab League proposal for Scottish  magistrates to try the men in the International Court of Justice  in The Hague have been well received in the West.    But Washington and London have both rejected the idea,  saying  the United Nations had called for the men to be extradited for  trial either in the United States or in Britain.    ""It seems a solution has been found"" and that the proposal  ""will be submitted as a resolution to the UN Security Council  for adoption,"" al-Qadhdhafi said.    He said the proposal was backed by Egypt and the  Organisation  of African Unity as well as the Arab League.    UN sanctions have been imposed on Libya following its  refusal  to handover the men and those involved in the bombing of a  French private plane over Niger in 1989 which killed 170 people.     "

He said that after  contacts with a number of officials, we opted to keep silent for  a while and to allow quiet diplomacy to resolve the issue so  that it may not be misinterpreted. We maintained this stance  because we believe that through dialogue, understanding, and  discussions we may find serious solutions to all problems,  whereas other means would lead nowhere.    Ja'ja' said that certain state officials began about 10 days  ago to point the finger at the LF as responsible for the bombing  of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and other bombings. He wondered  if it is possible to try a case before a court hearing even  begins. He pointed out that the recent statement issued by the  Internal Security Forces Directorate looks as if the explosive  charge was prepared at the LF main headquarters. He asked: If  this is true, is it possible to occupy the center? He said that  the case should be referred to the judiciary to hear the case  and hand down a verdict, because accusing people falsely is  inadmissible.    Ja'ja' stressed that the LF, as always, will side with  justice to the end. He pointed out that the LF has offered  10,000 martyrs in defense of churches in all Lebanese areas, and  wondered if it is reasonable for the LF to bomb a church  anywhere.    Ja'ja' noted that what is happening these days may be the  last link in a chain before suppressing political freedoms in  Lebanon. He said: As for me, the situation is very clear.  Every time a security incident occurs, it is used as a pretext  to take further security measures to apply more pressure on the  opposition parties, individuals, and politicians instead of  hunting down the perpetrators.    He wonders if political opposition is not allowed in  Lebanon.  If it is not allowed, he said, let them say so clearly so that  everyone will shoulder his responsibilities. He added: We set  forth our basic demand at the first news conference we held  after the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church: We want to  learn who bombed the church. He hoped that the state would find  the perpetrators. He said that the judiciary will decide this;  otherwise, why do countries take judicial measures in such  cases? He said: We truly wish that the case be referred to the  judiciary to hand down its verdict.    Ja'ja' said that the bombing of the church led to the  deployment of security forces in LF centers and surrounding  Ghidras [LF headquarters], although the investigations for the  past 10 days have not led to the bombers. He called for finding  the culprits responsible for the crime of bombing the church and  proceeding with judicial measures to find the culprits.     "

A number of  weapons were also confiscated in the sweep, which took place  last night. Alan Ben-'Ami reports:    [Begin Ben-'Ami recording] The authorities are being  tight-lipped about exactly how many people have been arrested  and who they are. But figures obtained from various sources,  including Palestinians in the territories, indicate that as many  as 400 or so people were detained in the round up. A terse  statement by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman also said  that weapons and ammunition were uncovered during the raids on  towns, villages, and refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.    The massive crack-down is being viewed as a severe blow to  Hamas and its operations, at least temporarily. But security  sources point out that there are gunmen from the 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam gangs still at large, and they can be expected to  mount attacks of one sort or another, despite this wide-spread  move against Hamas members and operatives at various levels.  Certainly, this is the biggest operation against Hamas in the  territories since Israel deported more than 400 to Lebanon in  December 1992. An international outcry resulted and all the  deported being allowed to eventually return, and some of the  were among the men picked up in this new crack-down. Most of the  people arrested are said to be in their late teens or early  twenties, and to include a number who were directly involved  with planned terrorist attacks.    Hamas has openly boasted that its members were planning a  total of five attacks against Israelis, with two more still to  come, following the deadly bombs in 'Afula and Hadera and the ax  attack on a bus in Jerusalem. Seven Israelis have died and more  than 80 been injured in those attacks. A number of prominent  Hamas personalities, including Taysir Tamimi and Jamal  al-Natshah from Hebron, and Yasir Mansur from Nabulus are  amongst those arrested. The big wave of arrests follows raids  last week in which about 70 Hamas activists and operatives were  picked up. Security sources say more arrests can be expected in  the days ahead.

The arrests eased pressure on president FW de Klerk who has come under mounting criticism for failing to act swiftly against the right. Police would not release the names of those arrested. It was not clear whether the rightwing leaders who openly led the attack - well-known politicians such as Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the rightwing Conservative Party and head of the official parliamentary opposition, along with Mr Eugene Terreblanche, the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB),and General Constand Viljoen, head of the Afrikaner Volksfront, an umbrella right-wing group - had been arrested. Mr de Klerk had promised arrests within 24 hours of the attack, which saw leading politicians chased through the corridors of the constitutional conference centre by armed men from the AWB. Police said arrests were delayed by the fact that suspects had given them false names, an explanation dismissed as ridiculous by Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress. Mr Mandela said last night the ANC was ready for violence from the right: 'If the rightwing thinks that they can use coercion and intimidation to get what they are unable to get through negotiation, they are making a serious mistake . . . And if they are thinking in terms of violence, we are ready for that. We would not like to talk along those terms, but we are not going to allow anybody to impose his will on the people of South Africa.' Constitutional talks were due to continue this week despite the attack. Harry Oppenheimer, Page 30   Countries:-  ZAZ   South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

0,FT941-8310 ,"FT941-8310 _AN-EBUCRAA7FT 940221   FT  21 FEB 94 / China political repression 'increasing'      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   Asia Watch, the international human rights group, has accused China of increasing political repression throughout the country, especially in Tibet where most recent arrests have taken place. A 664-page report documents more than 200 arrests of dissidents in 1993 and is certain to intensify pressure on China at a sensitive moment in its dealings with the West over human rights issues. The report coincides with a heightened campaign by international human rights organisations to block renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status in the US. President Bill Clinton, who has called for 'overall, significant improvement' in China's human rights behaviour, is due to decide by June whether to renew the MFN status. China is also under pressure at the current session in Geneva of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. This is in spite of its recent efforts to counter international criticism by releasing well known dissidents. Mr Sidney Jones, executive director of the US-based Asia Watch, called at the weekend for 'continued pressure' on China on human rights issues. His statement reflected concerns that the US is moving towards MFN renewal without securing substantial concessions. 'There is clear evidence such pressure has been effective in the past,' he said. 'Any move now to abandon that pressure would send a terrible signal to Beijing - open season on peaceful dissent.' Asia Watch said its lengthy report, entitled Detained in China and Tibet, 'shows clearly that political repression is increasing, not decreasing, and that it extends to virtually every province in China and throughout the Tibetan plateau.' Among specific Asia Watch criticisms were: 1993 was the 'worst' year for political arrests since the crackdown that followed the 1989 Tiananmen massacre with 250 cases, compared with last year's release of 37 dissidents. 80 per cent of the new political arrests occurred in Tibet, where the authorities embarked on an 'intensified' campaign of repression against Buddhist monks and nuns involved in pro-independence activities. The number of people detained for 'peaceful political and religious activities' is far higher than that 3,317 figure given by China as the number of sentenced 'counter-revolutionaries'. The authorities say there are 'no political prisoners in China'. Chinese standards of justice remain abysmally low by international standards, with limited prospects of a fair trial for those accused of 'counter-revolutionary crime'. Torture is widely practised both to secure 'confessions' and to maintain control in China's extensive prison and labour-camp system. Asia Watch said 'a most pressing and immediate need' was to secure regular access for organisations like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to work for better treatment of those in detention. It also called for more determined international efforts to uphold Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 'ensure that no one is arbitrarily detained in the first place'.

State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States has been told  ""at the highest levels"" of the Syrian government that ""if it is presented with  firm evidence that any group or individuals within its purview are responsible  for Pan Am 103, the Syrian government will take action against them.""    "" . . .To date, we're not satisfied with the Syrian government's responses, and  we think (it) can do more,"" Boucher said. ""We have discussed Pan Am 103 with  the Syrians on a number of occasions in diplomatic channels. We have urged  their full cooperation in finding those responsible.""    Administration sources said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III had  personally approved Thursday's statement on Syrian responsibility for terrorist  groups operating from Damascus.    The statement was the clearest public indication yet that the U.S. government  is convinced that elements of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command led by Ahmed Jibril were behind the midair bombing of  a Pan American World Airways Boeing 747 jumbo jet. The bombing and jet crash  caused the deaths of 270 people at Lockerbie, Scotland, last December.

State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States has been told  ""at the highest levels"" of the Syrian government that ""if it is presented with  firm evidence that any group or individuals within its purview are responsible  for Pan Am 103, the Syrian government will take action against them.""    "" . . .To date, we're not satisfied with the Syrian government's responses, and  we think (it) can do more,"" Boucher said. ""We have discussed Pan Am 103 with  the Syrians on a number of occasions in diplomatic channels. We have urged  their full cooperation in finding those responsible.""    Administration sources said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III had  personally approved Thursday's statement on Syrian responsibility for terrorist  groups operating from Damascus.    The statement was the clearest public indication yet that the U.S. government  is convinced that elements of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command led by Ahmed Jibril were behind the midair bombing of  a Pan American World Airways Boeing 747 jumbo jet. The bombing and jet crash  caused the deaths of 270 people at Lockerbie, Scotland, last December.

The vast majority of the driving-under-the-influence, or DUI, arrests were made  by the Costa Mesa police, Santa Ana police and California Highway Patrol, who  conducted intensive crackdowns with roving patrols.    Most other Orange County cities, however, reported only a smattering of DUI  arrests during the three-day holiday, despite a new state law that, effective  Monday, lowered the blood-alcohol level for drunk driving from 0.10% to 0.08%.    Anaheim police said they made only four DUI arrests all weekend, even though  they set up sobriety checkpoints both Friday night and New Year's Eve and  questioned more than 1,500 motorists. Two years ago, by comparison, Anaheim  police arrested eight people on suspicion of drunk driving at a single New  Year's Eve checkpoint.    ""I think that, hopefully, people are finally wising up and letting their  friends drive if they drink,"" said Anaheim Police Sgt. Frank Van DeWeerd.    In Huntington Beach, where police arrested three suspected drunk drivers, Sgt.  Luis Ochoa attributed the low number of arrests to a dense layer of fog that  blanketed many coastal areas and reduced New Year's Eve traffic.    ""It was very, very quiet, which is unusual for us on New Year's Eve,"" Ochoa  said.    Despite the hazardous driving conditions, Orange County law enforcement  officials reported no upsurge in traffic accidents and no fatal accidents over  the holiday weekend. The fog extended as far inland as Fountain Valley, where  things were so slow that officers made only seven DUI arrests and were sent out  on just four complaints of wild parties.    ""I've worked years past where we couldn't stop"" all night long, Sgt. Don  Nielsen said.    The holiday was also comparatively quiet in terms of gunfire from holiday  revelers, a tradition in predominantly Latino areas of the county. Immigrants  from Mexico and other Latin American countries, police officials say, are used  to celebrating the new year with pistol shots into the air.    In contrast to past years, when hundreds of bullets rained down over vast  portions of Orange County, only police in Santa Ana and Westminster had any  significant shooting activity to report. Police attributed the apparent  downturn in shooting to an education campaign that included the distribution of  leaflets in Latino neighborhoods.    In Santa Ana, seven mobile homes ""took a round through the roof"" from falling  bullets, Lt. Greg Cooper said. Last year, by comparison, Santa Ana police  fielded 24 reports of property damage from holiday gunfire.    The only reported injury on New Year's Eve was to a pedestrian in Santa Ana who  suffered a graze wound to the leg from one of the falling bullets. But Cooper  said it was so superficial that the man did not require medical treatment.    In Westminster, police received five reports of shots being fired into the air  and recovered one pistol that had been discarded by a reveler as officers sped  to one of the scenes. No damage or injuries were reported.    ""Compared to last year, it was almost like there was nothing going on,""  Westminster Police Lt. Bob Burnett said.    The busiest police activity over the New Year's weekend was generated by the  drunk-driving patrols instituted by the CHP and by police in Costa Mesa and  Santa Ana.    Costa Mesa police arrested 46 suspected drunk drivers during a nine-hour  enforcement program that began Sunday evening. The arrests, made by a 14-person  task force on roving patrols, topped last year's arrest total by 16, Sgt. Tom  Winter said.    ""It was a very, very effective program,"" Winter said.    Those arrested were detained in Costa Mesa City Jail, which was staffed with  extra personnel to process records and paper work, Winter said.    Santa Ana police, also operating in roving patrols, arrested 55 suspected drunk  drivers during a special crackdown period between Friday afternoon and Monday  morning, Lt. Cooper said.    CHP officers arrested 101 motorists in the county during the same period, CHP  spokesman Keith Thornhill said. The arrest breakdown included 46 in the CHP's  Santa Ana district, 30 in the San Juan Capistrano district and 25 in the  Westminster district, Thornhill said.

0,FT932-9926 ,"FT932-9926 _AN-DELCNAANFT 930512   FT  12 MAY 93 / Two held in Italian kickback inquiry      By HAIG SIMONIAN      MILAN   ITALIAN magistrates investigating kickbacks to political parties made two new arrests yesterday which further implicated the former Communist party in the widening corruption scandal. The ex-Communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) until recently has been relatively untouched by the corruption inquiries. Magistrates arrested Mr Renato Pollini, former administrative secretary of the Communist party, and Mr Fausto Bartolini, ex-director of a building company associated with Italy's powerful co-operative movement, as part of inquiries into alleged kickbacks from the state railway system. The arrests followed the issue of 14 cautionary warrants on Monday against businessmen and Transport Ministry officials. The accused are alleged to have connived in an arrangement to split kickbacks on railway orders between Italy's main political parties. Among those sought by the magistrates are Mr Franco Ferlin, an adviser at the time to Mr Carlo Bernini, a former transport minister. The PDS is fighting to defend its image after a recent stream of leaks and arrests have prompted claims that its members participated in schemes involving kickbacks on public-sector contracts. The party has denied receiving kickbacks from companies dealing with the railways in the period up to 1988 when it had a member on the rail board. Mr Pietro Tognoli, a Bergamo businessman, was arrested last week on allegations of having paid a 3 per cent kickback on a L200bn (Pounds 85m) contract for track sleepers. According to press leaks, 60 per cent of the L6bn was shared between the Christian Democrats (25 per cent), Socialists (15) and PDS (20). The rest went to government officials. The PDS has denied any involvement. A committee of the lower house of parliament put off until next week hearings on lifting the parliamentary immunity of Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist party leader, and Mr Claudio Martelli, a prominent ex-Socialist and former justice minister.

The threat appeared to draw a swift response from Belgrade, where Serb leaders and UN officials announced a ceasefire agreement late last night which a UN spokesman said met the terms of the Nato ultimatum. Envoys from the Nato defence alliance meeting in Brussels demanded an immediate ceasefire in Gorazde, withdrawal of all Serb forces from a 3km exclusion zone by midnight GMT tonight, and access to the city for peacekeepers and medical workers. If these demands were not met, air attacks could start against any Serb military targets within 20km of the city. The Serbs were also threatened with bombing runs unless they withdrew heavy guns from 20km around Gorazde by early Wednesday. Nato stopped short of issuing similar ultimatums for four other UN-designated 'safe areas', although a senior diplomat said they would do so if 'there are attacks or clear threats of attack'. In Belgrade, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia said the UN and Bosnian Serbs had reached 'full agreement' on a ceasefire and the normalisation of relations between the two sides. Mr Yasushi Akashi, senior UN official in former Yugoslavia, described the talks as 'positive' with respect to 'the urgency of the crisis we face in Gorazde'. He said Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, had agreed to an immediate ceasefire which was due to come into force at noon local time today. No details of the ceasefire agreement - one of many this week - were immediately available, and it is uncertain whether Bosnian Serb forces will comply. Shelling resumed in Gorazde last night after an early evening lull. Nato's threats are the toughest warning the alliance has issued to the Bosnian Serbs. They underline a sense of urgency over conditions in Gorazde, where more than 500 people have been killed and 1,700 wounded in a Serb offensive. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said: 'Half-measures will not do. The alliance has decided to take resolute action. The situation demands action.' In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the Bosnian Serbs 'should not doubt' Nato's willingness to act. 'This decision provides Nato forces with broader authority to respond to Bosnian Serb attacks.' Mr Clinton contradicted reports that his administration was reconsidering its refusal to send ground troops to Bosnia before the completion of a peace agreement, and also said that extending bombing raids into Serbia 'would not be appropriate at this time'. But Mr William Perry, defence secretary, said any air strikes resulting from the ultimatum should be 'vigorous. . . That means in quantity of airplanes sent over and in diversity of targets'. Targets for bombing would be defined by the alliance in consultation with Unprofor, the UN protection force in Bosnia, according to a Nato statement. This indicated the alliance had secured greater freedom of action than before in choosing where to attack. City where the dead are lucky Page 2   Countries:-  BEZ  Belgium, EC.

Opponents of nuclear power rejoiced Monday over their three-day demonstration  against the Seabrook nuclear power plant, which resulted in 717 arrests, and  said it marks a new beginning for the movement.    But plant officials called the protests an inconvenience staged for the media  as plant personnel prepared the reactor for low-power testing this week.    Ninety arrests were made Monday as protesters blocked gates to prevent  employees from getting to work. On Sunday, police made 627 arrests after  demonstrators swarmed over and under fences surrounding the plant.    ""The Clamshell's back and they're gonna be sorry,"" Roy Morrison, a member of  the Clamshell Alliance that organized the protest, said of Seabrook supporters.    Seabrook officials contend that the demonstrators are a minority, and the  officials note that the $6-billion plant is on the verge of its first nuclear  chain reaction after winning a low-power testing license last month.    Plant spokesman Ron Sher said most New Englanders believe that the plant is  safe, necessary and ready to produce power.    Seabrook has been in the first stages of low-power testing for about a week,  slowly warming the reactor while engineers prepare to withdraw control rods and  allow the first nuclear chain reaction.    However, the seaside plant still lacks a commercial operating license because  it lacks federal approval of evacuation plans for the area in case of an  emergency. And a planned second reactor was canceled because of financial  strain.

Opponents of nuclear power rejoiced Monday over their three-day demonstration  against the Seabrook nuclear power plant, which resulted in 717 arrests, and  said it marks a new beginning for the movement.    But plant officials called the protests an inconvenience staged for the media  as plant personnel prepared the reactor for low-power testing this week.    Ninety arrests were made Monday as protesters blocked gates to prevent  employees from getting to work. On Sunday, police made 627 arrests after  demonstrators swarmed over and under fences surrounding the plant.    ""The Clamshell's back and they're gonna be sorry,"" Roy Morrison, a member of  the Clamshell Alliance that organized the protest, said of Seabrook supporters.    Seabrook officials contend that the demonstrators are a minority, and the  officials note that the $6-billion plant is on the verge of its first nuclear  chain reaction after winning a low-power testing license last month.    Plant spokesman Ron Sher said most New Englanders believe that the plant is  safe, necessary and ready to produce power.    Seabrook has been in the first stages of low-power testing for about a week,  slowly warming the reactor while engineers prepare to withdraw control rods and  allow the first nuclear chain reaction.    However, the seaside plant still lacks a commercial operating license because  it lacks federal approval of evacuation plans for the area in case of an  emergency. And a planned second reactor was canceled because of financial  strain.    Low-power testing had been planned for today or Wednesday, but Sher said plant  officials now plan to start testing the reactor sometime after Wednesday  because a valve failed in a pump during the weekend.

The Libyan announcement follows moves by Britain, France and the US to prepare a UN Security Council resolution imposing an air and arms embargo on Libya until it hands over the suspects. A British lawyer who interviewed the suspects says they are eager to go on trial to prove their innocence. The US and Britain allege the two men were Libyan intelligence agents and were involved in bombing the Pan Am airliner over Scotland which killed 270 people.

If the siege of  Sarajevo is not lifted, NATO will begin bombing Serb positions.    [Commentator F. Tavrovskiy] This is far from the first  ultimatum that has been given. One can cite similarities with  the years of the Cold War when China gave the United States its  547th serious and final warning for violating its territorial  waters. Things are different here, and the most important  difference in this ultimatum is the existence of a strictly  defined 10-day period. Moreover, now NATO does not need to  spend a long time seeking consent from the large UN bureaucracy.  The decision to start bombing will be taken directly with the  participation of Butrus-Ghali.    Now there is only Russia which can lift the threat from the  Serbs. Today Russia called for the urgent convening of the UN  Security Council to discuss the crisis. As Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Adamishin stated, Russia is calling for a  settlement of the Bosnian conflict by means of demilitarizing  Sarajevo and handing over the city to UN control. Adamishin  expressed disagreement with the view that Butrus-Ghali has given  NATO authority to carry out bombing strikes. Butrus-Ghali has  only asked whether the North Atalantic Alliance is ready, if  necessary, to make its aviation available but he did not hand  over UN functions to NATO, Adamishin stressed.    The deputy foreign minister said that in the near future  Boris Yeltsin will have telephone conversations with the leaders  of Western countries on the question of Bosnia.    [Announcer] All the same, it should be noted that the  statement made by Russia today puts it in a rather complicated  position. In the first place, the decision by the North  Atlantic Alliance is already based on a UN Security Council  resolution which allows military force to be used in extreme  cases. Therefore, the attempts of the Russian leaders to  transfer the discussion of the Bosnian question to the Security  Council will, most likely, not be successful. This dissenting  position by Russia, perhaps for the first time in recent years,  is putting it on the path toward confrontation with Western  diplomacy.     "

More than 40 arrests were ordered yesterday, the day after the Italian government approved a controversial decree to limit the use of arrests in the investigative process. Magistrates joined a chorus of protests from left-wing opposition parties yesterday against the government move. As well as Mr Alberto Falck, who has headed the steel company since 1982, and Mr Giuseppe Tramontana of La Rinascente, orders for arrest were also issued for the president of the Italian accountants' federation, and executives from sectors as diverse as construction, pharmaceuticals and funeral direction. Neither Falck nor La Rinascente commented on the developments. The Milan magistrates' inquiry - latest in the two-year effort to uncover corruption - centres on Italy's Guardia di Finanza. Officers co-operating with magistrates have alleged that large Italian companies systematically bribed a unit assigned to investigate potential tax fraud by businesses with turnover of more than L5bn (Pounds 2m) a year. Police supposedly ignored accounting abuses and tax fraud after receiving kickbacks. Italian companies caught up in corruption investigations since 1992 have always claimed they were obliged to pay bribes to political parties because it was the only way to do business under the corrupt old regime. If upheld, the new charges will cast serious doubt on the claim that they were reluctant parties to fraud. Eight Guardia di Finanza officers are already under arrest, and warrants for the arrest of six more were issued yesterday. Within the past week, two others have committed suicide, including a general in Trieste, who shot himself on Wednesday, even though he was apparently not yet on the investigation list. The Guardia di Finanza is still one of the main tools used by magistrates to pursue investigations, and has an important role in tracking down drug trafficking and money laundering. Yesterday's arrests were carried out by specially selected members of the unit, and magistrates and members of the government have made a point of expressing their confidence in the Guardia to avoid a further decline in morale. Meanwhile, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left yesterday called for an urgent Senate debate of the measures unveiled by Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister, late on Wednesday night. According to Mr Biondi, the government is trying to stop abuse of preventive arrests by strictly limiting the occasions on which this measure can be applied to those suspected of having committed a crime. Magistrates have made extensive use of arrest and imprisonment to ensure evidence is not tampered with and to prevent those under investigation from fleeing the country. However, there has been public concern that these powers have been distorted to force confessions. Often people appeared to have been detained in prison only for as long as they had not confessed. It was also used as a form of public humiliation. The new legislation - in the form of a decree with immediate effect - means that imprisonment would be reserved for more serious crimes like drugs-trafficking and membership of a criminal organisation.

Held without bail pending further court action were Mr Aldrich Ames, 52, most recently the chief of the Soviet branch of the CIA's counter-intelligence unit, and his wife, Mrs Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, 41, a US citizen who did not work for the CIA. Justice Department officials said the couple, arrested separately by the FBI on Sunday, had been charged with spying for the Soviet Union from 1985 until its demise in 1991 and then for Russia, in return for more than Dollars 1m (Pounds 685,000) in pay-offs. Mr Ames has been employed by the Central Intelligence Agency for 31 years, the department said. He served as chief of the Soviet Counter-intelligence Branch from 1983 to 1985. He had previously been a CIA operations agent recruiting Soviet officials and KGB officers to spy against the Soviet Union, according to court papers. Since 1969, he had served at CIA posts in Ankara and Mexico City, as well as doing several stints at the agency's headquarters. Officials described it as one of the biggest spy cases ever, because of the extent of the material allegedly passed and the sensitive nature of compromised national security information. The arrests capped an investigation that had run for over two years, they said, apparently triggered by a tip from a KGB defector. No further arrests were expected. The two arrests confirmed that the Soviet Union had been able to penetrate the CIA, planting a mole inside the US spy agency, just as some veteran intelligence officials had long suspected. In a brief court hearing in suburban Alexandria, Virginia, a federal magistrate ordered the couple to be held in jail without bail until another hearing on Friday. President Bill Clinton said later yesterday that it was 'a serious case'. 'We will be immediately lodging a protest to the Russian government,' he said.

SERRANO, Times Staff Writers      ATLANTA      The U.S. citizen who has emerged as a suspect in the bombing of a van belonging  to Navy Capt. Will Rogers III has told The Times that although he is being  closely interrogated by federal law enforcement officials, he is not  responsible for the March 10 bombing that nearly killed Rogers' wife.    ""I didn't do it and I don't know who did it,"" said H. George Marxmiller, a  former Navy flier and commercial pilot for Eastern Airlines who now lives in  Lake Oconee, Ga.    ""But they suspect I know who did it. (Yet) to think I would do something like  this is utter nonsense. It's so out of character. It doesn't compute.""    Marxmiller, who said he is cooperating fully with the investigation, said his  name surfaced in the case after he contacted the FBI with allegations against  Rogers, the former skipper of the Vincennes. The Times has been unable to  substantiate those allegations.    In interviews Sunday and Monday, Marxmiller and Rogers said that they met only  once, several years ago, and that they have had no contact since.    ""I dimly remember the guy,"" Rogers said of Marxmiller. ""I have no idea why he  would be involved in this thing. And I have no other comment.""    Rogers' wife, Sharon, narrowly escaped injury when the family van she was  driving exploded at a busy La Jolla intersection.    The FBI took jurisdiction in the case, primarily because officials believed the  pipe bombing was an act of revenge for Capt. Rogers' order in July, 1988, to  shoot down what turned out to be an Iranian airliner. All 290 people aboard the  civilian aircraft were killed. Rogers, who commanded the guided missile cruiser  Vincennes in the Persian Gulf, was exonerated on grounds that he had reason to  believe his ship was under attack.    Federal investigators assumed at first that the van bombing could have been a  terrorist act committed on U.S. soil. However, that thinking changed in  September when Marxmiller, 48, surfaced as a potential suspect.    Multiple sources have confirmed that Marxmiller is the leading suspect. Tom  Hughes, special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego, has refused to comment  publicly on the status of the investigation.    In a four-hour interview, Marxmiller detailed the extent to which federal  investigators have pored over his life and attempted to determine whether he is  responsible for the bombing.    He said he took a polygraph test in the summer and was asked whether he was  involved in the bombing. He said the results were inconclusive. In early  September, he said, he submitted to a second lie detector test.    In the second examination, he said he believes he passed the first of two key  questions when he said he did not attach the bomb to the van.    But, he said, he apparently failed the second key question of whether he had  planned the bombing or knew who placed the bomb under the van. ""That's what  triggered all this stuff,"" he said of the FBI's keen interest in him.    In addition, the FBI has asked for his fingerprints and a photograph, and have  subjected him and a brother to lengthy interviews about their whereabouts up to  and after the bombing of the van.    A federal grand jury in San Diego on Sept. 26 issued a subpoena asking  Marxmiller to submit two blood samples, in what federal sources said is an  attempt to compare his blood type with that found in saliva taken from  cigarette butts found outside the Rogers' home.      Denied Vendetta    Marxmiller smokes menthol cigarettes, and sources have said menthol cigarette  butts were found near the Rogers home.    The FBI also has shown interest in the fact that Rogers' name is among three  dozen people listed as witnesses on behalf of Marxmiller's wife, Rebecca  Marxmiller, who is suing for divorce in Dekalb County, Ga. Neither George  Marxmiller nor Rogers had any explanation for why Rogers name was listed as a  witness.    Marxmiller said he has been going through difficult times -- including his  pending divorce and his decision to honor a March 4 strike at Eastern Airlines.  But he adamantly denied having any personal vendetta against Capt. Rogers or  any desire to harm him or his family.    ""I don't have anything against the guy,"" Marxmiller said.    Nevertheless, he said that the FBI is now checking his alibi. Marxmiller said  he attended a high school basketball game in Atlanta on March 9. He also  produced a personal check with his signature that was canceled at an Atlanta  bank on March 9.    Ron Sanders, 48, an Eastern Airlines pilot who lives in Lithonia, Ga., told The  Times he went to the basketball game with Marxmiller and Marxmiller's son.    ""George was with me from approximately 4 p.m. or thereabouts or 4:30 until  almost midnight on the 9th,"" Sanders said. ""His son spent the night with him at  George's apartment, after I dropped them off at approximately midnight. So  George could not have been anywhere but Atlanta on the night of the 9th."" The  bomb went off in San Diego early the next morning and investigators have said  it probably was planted sometime the previous night.    Added Marxmiller: ""The fact is, I wasn't there"" in San Diego. ""Those are the  facts.    Instead, Marxmiller said he was last in California on Feb. 24 through 27, when  he visited friends and a brother who lives near Los Angeles.    The brother, who has since moved to Lake Oconee, told The Times that he was  interviewed by FBI agents late last week. He said he spent more than nine hours  with agents on Thursday and Friday, and that he also took a polygraph test. He  said he did not know how the lie detector test turned out.      Brother Denies Involvement    The brother denied in an interview with The Times that he was involved in the  bombing.    ""I didn't do it,"" he said. ""I didn't have anything to do with it.""    He said the fact that he and his brother voluntarily notified the FBI shows  that they have nothing to hide.    ""If we hadn't gone to them, there'd be no possible way they would have gotten  on to us,"" he said. ""And then people wonder why people don't get involved.""    Times staff writer Ronald J.

A police statement on Thursday night said those arrested were members of the Serbian Chetniks, the paramilitary wing of Mr Seselj's Radical party, and were charged with committing violent crimes against civilians. The arrests represent the most direct admission by Belgrade that paramilitaries from Serbia committed what amount to war crimes, including murders and rape, on Bosnian and Serbian territory. But instead of reflecting a crackdown on war criminals, the arrests appear merely to signal the settling of scores by Mr Milosevic against Mr Seselj. Indeed, Serbia's state-run media are promoting Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, another MP who commands a fierce paramilitary group.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.

The incident at Episkopi was used as  a golden opportunity for the promotion of anti-Greek propaganda  and to justify preplanned persecutions against minority members.    If the first wave of arrests was done to discover some  evidence to support the claim about a Greek intervention, the  second wave of arrests had exclusively political aims. Tirana's  first aim is the cultivation of a climate of terror and fear  among the North Ipiros citizens to force them to flee. Tirana's  strategic aim is not the neutralization of any offensive  tendencies [by the Greek minority] but the uprooting of the  minority.    Tirana's stance toward the Greek minority is indirectly but  clearly connected with its demands in Kosovo. By showing its  own offensive ideology, Tirana is certain that Athens will make  the same demands on North Ipiros that it has made on Kosovo.  For this reason, Tirana seeks the expulsion of Greeks before  things reach the negotiating table.    All of the above is taking place during a time of economic  downfall, social degradation, and fanatic aggressiveness,  something that creates the conditions to channel the internal  crisis toward dangerous adventurism. That is why the  possibility that the Albanian side will launch a pogrom against  the Greek minority remains open. Athens has the obligation to  prevent it by making clear, well in advance, its decision not to  allow such a development.    Tirana's second aim, which is the destruction of bilateral  relations and the creation of an offensive climate to stop the  rise of the Greek-oriented conscience within significant parts  of the Orthodox Albanian or Albanian elements, is equally  important. This aggressiveness is not due to some unfounded  Greek propaganda but to the revival of Islam and discriminatory  feelings among the Orthodox Albanians. This is the reason why  the Berisha regime attacks Archbishop Anastasios with such  force, even though he is limited to his religious duties.     "

0,FT931-4803 ,"FT931-4803 _AN-DCICJAG3FT 930309   FT  09 MAR 93 / LDP seeks to distance itself from Kanemaru      By CHARLES LEADBEATER   MR SHIN KANEMARU, until last autumn the most powerful man in Japanese politics, is to be detained in the Tokyo detention centre for 10 days for questioning over alleged tax evasion involving Y1.2bn (Pounds 7m) bank bonds. The ruling Liberal Democratic party's leadership was yesterday struggling to distance itself from the affair which threatens to embroil the government in another damaging scandal. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and senior LDP officials have argued that the tax evasion charges are a personal rather than a political issue. The arrest has nevertheless led them to promise to pursue plans for the reform of political funding and the electoral system. Opposition parties plan to exploit the affair to embarrass the government, which is only just recovering from the debilitating Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal. They will allege that Mr Kanemaru's tax evasion was closely linked to his political activities, in particular the financial backing he helped to organise for Mr Noboru Takeshita, former prime minister. Mr Kanemaru, who resigned from the Japanese parliament last October after admitting receiving a Y500m illegal donation from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, and Mr Masahisa Haibara, his private secretary, are thought to hold about Y2.8bn of discount bonds issued by the Nippon Credit Bank. Such bonds do not have to be registered by name. The tax authorities believe Mr Kanemaru and Mr Haibara bought some of the bonds between 1987 and 1989 using about Y1.2bn of undeclared income. The timing of the arrests was highly political. The two men were arrested on Saturday evening, just hours after the Japanese parliament's lower house had passed the budget for 1993. The prospect of the arrests seemed to have accelerated agreement on the budget after the LDP unexpectedly agreed to examine opposition proposals for income tax cuts. For their part, the prosecutors seem to have held off until the budget was approved. Had the arrests been made before the budget had been passed, the opposition would have forced a delay in the budget process to debate Mr Kanemaru's arrest. Such a delay would have threatened to undermine confidence on the Tokyo stock market.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.   Industries:-  P8651 Political Organizations.

This case raises many  questions which remain unanswered at a time when security  circles affirm that the defendants will soon be referred to the  State Security Court. Among the questions that remain  unanswered are: How many defendants are involved in the bombing  incidents? Do they belong to an organization that has programs  and objectives? What is this organization's link to Islamic  movements in Jordan? Does it have connections with outside  circles for financing and support? What are the objectives that  they are trying to achieve in Jordan? How did the security  forces manage to reach the perpetrators of those operations?  SHIHAN has managed to uncover and answer all of these and other  questions.    A security official told SHIHAN that the explosions at the  Rivoli and Salva theaters were not the first of their kind. The  bombings began at the al-Yarmuk Cinema in al-Baq'ah [refugee  camp] in 1988. The security official, who preferred to remain  anonymous, explained his viewpoint on the details of the  bombings. He said: The plan, which was drawn up by the 30  defendants, most of whom received training and lived in  Afghanistan, goes back to 1988. That is the year in which the  explosion at the al-Yarmuk Cinema in al-Baq'ah took place.  However, the repeated travel by their leaders to Afghanistan  and the Philippines, and the discovery of 'Muhammad's Army',  which carried out similar acts, prompted those individuals to  suspend their activities in Jordan.    The security official continues: Some of those who returned  from Afghanistan and who have been arrested are members of the  Islamic Action Front Party. However, the Front had nothing to  do with their acts. He indicated that this ""organization"", if  one can call it that, is composed of two groups: The first,  which is the smaller of the two, carried out the al-Yarmuk  Cinema bombing in 1988. The second, includes the leaders as  well as the first group. [as published].    The security official said that 'Abdallah Kamul  al-Hashayikah, who belongs to the Muslim Brothers, is the leader  of this organization, and that Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ayyad is the  second man in the organization. The security official revealed  that this organization endeavors to promote the spirit of jihad  and raises the jihad slogan through the Islamic world. It seeks  to eliminate vileness and to strike at the dens of corruption.  He explained that it became clear from the investigation of the  defendants in the bombing operations that their motive was  opposition to what they termed as capitulation. They also  targeted theaters and liquor stores out of their belief that  they play a vile role and should be uprooted as a religious  duty. They believe there is no alternative to the use of force  by bombing operations.    The security official indicated that the bombing scheme was  not confined to the bombings at the Rivoli and Salva theaters.  An explosive charge was placed in a toffee box at the 'Akrush  stores in Safut [a village between Amman and al-Baq'ah refugee  camp], but failed to explode. A similar charge was placed at  the Zahran Cinema in Amman. He said that investigations  revealed that first class hotels in Amman were also a target.  Furthermore, the investigations revealed a plan to assassinate  political figures in the Jordanian and Palestinian peace  delegations. However, President Yasir 'Arafat's name was not  among them because they could not monitor his movements, but  they were following the movements of members of the Jordanian  and Palestinian delegations.    The security official revealed that the defendants  intensified their activities during the month of January this  year because the main financier of their operations and plans, a  Saudi citizen working with Usamah Bin Ladin, was planning to  visit Jordan. The official continued to identify the financiers  of the organization by saying that: Usamah Bin-Ladin is a  wealthy Saudi who lives outside Saudi Arabia and is known for  supporting extremist Islamic movements around the world. He was  a friend of the late 'Abdallah 'Azzam, the spiritual leader of  the Jordanian Afghans.    On the relationship between what took place in Jordan and  what is taking place in Egypt, the official said the defendants  had no links to the fundamentalist organizations that are  responsible for bombings in Egypt. However, some of the  defendants confessed to their admiration for what is happening  in Egypt and Algeria.    He said most defendants had confessed to the charges against  them, and that quantities of dynamite and raw materials used for  making homemade explosives, such as acetone peroxide, a highly  explosive material, in addition to a few pistols and machine  guns, were discovered at their homes. He did not rule out the  fact that other weapons may have been hidden because the arrest  of some defendants was expected after some of their colleagues  were arrested.    The security official suggested a link between this  organization, to which he did not give a name, and Muhammad's  Army. However, he said that there is an organizational  interconnection, but not organizational relations between the  two. He denied that any of the defendants in the bombings were  members of Muhammad's Army.    On how the organization and the defendants were uncovered,  the official said that the first link in the chain was defendant  'Id al-Jahhali, who was injured in the theater explosion. At  first, he was moved with the other injured people who were  inside the theater. However, the forensic experts had suspicions  about his injuries because he lost his two legs and a finger.  Thus, when his condition, described as critical, improved, he  was interrogated by security men. He admitted he had placed the  explosive charge in the theater. He said he waited for a while  before leaving to avoid suspicion, but got carried away watching  the movie and the charge exploded under his seat. The official  said al-Jahhalin admitted to the names of those who carried out  the bombings with him. They were led by Muhammad 'Ali  Abu-'Ayyad, who gave him the explosive charge and who supervised  all the bombing operations.    The security official concluded by affirming that the  judicial circles have started interrogating the defendants and  that a charge sheet will most likely be ready in 3 weeks. He  refused to reveal where the defendants are being detained. He  merely said that ""they are being held in an officially  recognized prison.""     "

The seven were trying to sell the nuclear material for Dollars 400,000 and had been arrested in Vrancea, central Romania, following a tip off from security services. It is the second uranium smuggling incident in Romania in the past 10 days. Police said last week they had arrested six Romanians, including two army officers, who were attempting to sell 4.5kg of uranium 235 and 238 at a villa near Bucharest. Officials said they believed the uranium had come from abroad. The arrests follow a recent spate of cases of uranium smuggling in eastern Europe. Most have involved uranium from nuclear plants in the former Soviet Union. Romania, which borders the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Moldova, is close to completing its first nuclear plant.

KROMER   Sir, Why are the British furious about the commemoration of the V-2 rocket? To me, they seem to have lost the ability to take an unbiased view of that fantastic technological breakthrough. I am proud of the fact that inventors and engineers from my country opened the gate to space technology and the landing on the moon. As early as the 1930s the ingenious Dr Werner von Braun dreamt of the space age and - to put it bluntly - the V-2 was an aunt of the famous Saturn V b. Those pioneers were guided by space enthusiasm and not by the idea of bombing the British capital. I think you would have to concede that Sir Arthur Harris did not have that dream when he was bombing women and children in Dresden.

The Security Council, at the urging of the US, Britain and France, adopted the new sanctions on November 11. But it gave Libya a grace period until they went into effect at 5.01am GMT yesterday. The sanctions freeze Libya's financial assets abroad but exclude future funds derived from oil, natural gas or agricultural commodities exports. Sanctions in force since April 1992 ban all civilians' flights to and from the country and the sales of aircraft parts and arms. They can be suspended if Libya surrenders the two accused for trial in Britain or the US in connection with the bombing. Libya also must satisfy demands of a French magistrate investigating the mid-flight bombing of France's UTA Flight 772 over Niger in 1989 in which 171 people died.

According to the command of the Herzegovina Corps, the  second  NATO attack at about 1445 yesterday [11 April] took place in the  area of the Serb village of Bare, 2 km from Gorazde.    However, ambulance cars belonging to the Serb forces were  hit  instead of Srpska republic army tanks, as NATO representatives  claimed.    Two paramedics from Gacko [Serb-held town south of Gorazde]  were killed on this occasion and two ambulance cars were  completely destroyed. Two Serb houses were also completely  destroyed. Their inhabitants had fled the Muslim attacks almost  two years ago.    The Americans fired missiles and dropped bombs of great  destructive power on Serb positions. This is illustrated by the  fact that one of the missiles broke through three 20  centimeter-thick concrete floors.    According to Serb sources, everything was most probably  carried out in agreement with the Muslim side -- immediately  before the bombing raid yesterday thick black smoke rose from  chimneys of houses in Gorazde. In this way the Muslims were  marking the no-target zone for the Americans.    Simultaneously with the attack of the American planes, the  Muslim forces launched an infantry attack on Serb positions from  Gorazde, with strong support from recoilless guns, mortars,  antiaircraft guns, and multiple rocket launchers.    Where did the Muslims from Gorazde, a UN safe area, get all  the weapons and ammunition? That is what only they and the NATO  representatives know. However, they were not able to move the  Serb positions.    Details of the U.S. attack in the Mount Preljuca area two  days ago have also been revealed. This area is 15 kilometers  from Gorazde and it is a part of the [Serb-held] Foca  municipality.    It is logical to ask: How did the Americans want to protect  UN military observers in Gorazde by bombing positions so far  away?    As long as one can remember, Preljuca has always been a Serb  territory, and a year ago the Muslims committed a horrific crime  in the village of Crnetici just beneath Preljuca, killing more  than 20 civilians, including two infants. The U.S. planes have  carried on the job.     "

It wishes to put the following points  on record:    First, the crime comes in the context of a scheme seeking to  undermine the process of security and national accord which has  made great progress with Syrian assistance. It aims to involve  the country in a new cycle of violence, keep the Lebanese arena  open to those who wish to exploit it in order to pressure and  weaken Lebanon, throw Syria's role in Lebanon into confusion,  and undermine the two countries' relationship. The crime comes  in the wake of the bombing of the Phalangist Party headquarters  in al-Sayfi and several other similar operations. A number of  suspects were arrested after these operations, which proves that  the same groups are responsible for all these crimes.  Consequently, we ask the state: What point has the  investigation into the al-Sayfi bombing reached? Would it not  have been possible to halt all these assaults on Lebanon and  these new crimes against the Lebanese people if the Lebanese  security departments had succeeded in apprehending the al-Sayfi  culprits? What point has the interrogation of the pro-Israeli  ring reached? Some of this ring's leaders were uncovered,  arrested, and accused of planning assassinations of Lebanese  officials and the bombing of various places.    We demand increased focus on these investigations and urge  that all information that thus comes to light be made public.  We all urge that the severest penalties, up to execution, be  inflicted on the suspects. We call for measures to extradite  Ghassan Tuma, the most prominent fugitive suspect linked to the  aforementioned operations.    Second, the PSP warned earlier of the consequences of having  several diverse official security agencies that have no  coordination whatsoever with each other. Indeed, some of their  actions undermine the efforts seeking to maintain security,  prevent infiltrations, or uncover criminals, particularly the  perpetrators of crimes against the state's security. We  reemphasize our call to reexamine this affair. We urge that  this be done from the perspective of supreme national interest.  If it is unavoidable to have all these separate agencies, at  least let them be placed under a unified command and let matters  follow their proper course.    Third, it is clear that a single political-security  operations room is making plans, implementing them, and trying  to exploit the results. In the context of sectarian sedition  and to cause greater rifts among the Lebanese people, some  forces are now raising their heads and pretending to be  concerned about the Christians' welfare and future. These  forces already stand convicted of formerly involving the  Christians in strife, causing their displacement from their  homes, and forcing them to make suicidal choices that have cost  them and cost Lebanon dearly. They now exploit any political or  security incident to pressure, intimidate, and incite them,  heighten their frustration, and then call for self-isolation and  demand special guarantees. They try to do this just when all  the Lebanese people are unanimous in their opinion that such  crimes are directed against them all and against Lebanon's  national unity and future.    Hence, efforts must be made to isolate and excise this  pro-Israeli tendency from Lebanon's national body and prevent it  from achieving its aims.    Fourth, in such circumstances, just as in our daily life,  the  media play a vital role. Some of them are part of the  above-mentioned operations room and are consequently incapable  of exercising the necessary self-censorship and halting the  dangerous sectarian incitements so evident in their news and  other programs. We urge the state to act promptly and pass a law  organizing the audiovisual media. This law will lay down  restrictions and prevent the use of media for such a purpose or  other purposes that threaten national unity and national and  social morality.     "

The wife, who was questioned by police, did not receive a bomb in the blitz for which a second man was also charged. News of the arrests and that the targets were all from the same family calmed nerves over a wide area of northern New York state where residents had earlier reported dozens of suspicious packages. Prosecutors announced the arrests 24 hours after the six parcel bombs were sent out to members of the Fowler family in the Buffalo and Rochester areas early on Tuesday evening. Police sources said one of the men arrested was the estranged husband of a member of the family and that the second man was his friend. Beside the five deaths two people were injured in the attacks. Two packages were disarmed before they could explode.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

The FBI, which is coordinating the investigation, on Sunday appealed to the  public for help in developing leads to the pipe-bomb attack Friday morning from  which Sharon Rogers escaped unhurt. Her husband's order to shoot down an  aircraft mistakenly thought to be an attacking Iranian jet fighter last July  over the Persian Gulf led to Iranian threats of retaliation against the United  States. The downed plane turned out of be an Iranian civilian airliner. All 290  aboard were killed.      Speculation on Bombing    Investigators have speculated that the bombing of Mrs. Rogers' car may have  been an act of retaliation, although they have not ruled out such other motives  as a disgruntled sailor.    FBI spokesman Gene Riehl said that ""in a perfect world, we would like to find  somebody who saw something very suspicious and out of place. We're looking for  people who saw anything suspicious"" around the bombing scene in the La Jolla  district of San Diego. Riehl said investigators already have received dozens of  calls, ""all generally helpful,"" about the incident. ""It is a great help and we  solve a huge number of cases with the help of callers,"" Riehl said.    Also Sunday, Thomas Hughes, head of the FBI office in San Diego, and Dennis  Usery, head of the Naval Investigative Service office here, met with the  Rogerses at an undisclosed location to discuss the investigation. Hughes  described the couple as ""in good spirits."" They have moved from their home near  the scene of the explosion and are under NIS guard.    The executive officer of Rogers' ship, the Vincennes, has taken over for the  captain in the last two days, but Rogers will resume his full command duties  shortly, a Navy spokesman said. Rogers will remain with the Vincennes until a  long-scheduled change of command takes place this July, the spokesman said.      Drums of Debris    FBI laboratory experts spent Sunday sifting through three drums filled with  debris collected near the site of the explosion and fire on Genesee Avenue  south of La Jolla Village Drive. Investigators finished their examination of  the scene late Saturday and moved the burned-out shell of the Rogers van to an  FBI garage, Riehl said.    ""There have been items of evidentiary value shipped to our laboratory in  Washington, D.C."" Riehl added.    In a brief statement Sunday afternoon, Hughes said investigators from the FBI,  the Naval Investigative Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,  the San Diego Police Department and the San Diego County Sheriff's Department  ""are all working very hard together to resolve the matter."" Hughes refused to  discuss the progress of the investigation.    The mangement and staff of all five agencies met all day Sunday to ""evaluate  the investigation"" and discuss plans for the coming days and weeks, Riehl said.    Riehl refused to respond to an editorial in an Iranian newspaper that blamed  the FBI for the bombing and contended the incident was engineered to provoke  anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.    ""We're not responding to that at all,"" he said.    The English-language newspaper Kayhan International linked the alleged U.S.  plot to Western anger at Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order that British  novelist Salman Rushdie be killed for his book, ""The Satanic Verses.""      Iranian Charge    The bombing ""will not be the last attempt to implicate Iran"" over the Rushdie  controversy, Kayhan International said in an editorial summarized by Iran's  official Islamic Republic News Agency.    The Associated Press reported that FBI spokeswoman Kathy Kennedy in Washington  deniedthe allegation and added: ""We have never made any linkage to Iran since  this incident happened.""    The incident occurred at 7:40 a.m. Friday as Sharon Rogers was en route to her  job at a private elementary school in La Jolla. Hearing what sounded like two  loud noises underneath the vehicle, she initially thought a motorist had struck  her van from behind. Moments after she stepped out to check for damage, the van  exploded into a fireball, but she was unhurt.    FBI officials have confirmed that a pipe bomb attached to the vehicle caused  the explosion.

The arrests mark an important step in a widening investigation by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor into improprieties at the company. The scandal is expected to involve gangsters and could net politicians as well. The police arrested Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, former president of Tokyo Sagawa and Mr Jun Saotome, former managing director of the company on charges of breach of trust. Also arrested were Mr Micho Ouchi, former chief accountant at Ichihara Kanko Kaihatsu, a golf course development company, and Mr Yasuo Matsuzawa, president of Heiwado, a medical equipment sales company. Improper loans and loan guarantees from Sagawa were allegedly funneled through the two companies with most of the funds eventually used for speculation in the stock market. This turned sour when the market turned down two years ago. Much of the money, however, is also alleged to have found its way into the hands of gangster-controlled companies associated with the Inagawakai, a large crime syndicate. It was alleged last night that Y5bn was funneled back to both ruling party and opposition politicians through the purchase of tickets for fund-raising events. It is unclear whether this type of political contribution would amount to impropriety on the part of the politicians, or whether Sagawa obtained any political favours as a result. Specific charges against the four men yesterday involved misappropriation of Y12.6bn in loans and loan guarantees. Prosecutors yesterday raided 15 more locations in an effort to assemble more evidence to support the charges. The raids have been well planned and publicised in advance and news of the unfolding scandal now occupies up to half of the 30-minute evening news on NHK, the state broadcasting system. The arrests were shown on television, although public prosectors refused to confirm news of the arrests to foreign journalists on the grounds that to do so would violate the civil rights of the accused. Public interest in the scandal has been heightened by the expectation that it may eventually bring down leading politicians.

The bombings began  at the al-Yarmuk Cinema in al-Baq'ah [refugee camp] in 1988. The  security official, who preferred to remain anonymous, explained  his viewpoint on the details of the bombings. He said: The  plan, which was drawn up by the 30 defendants, most of whom  received training and lived in Afghanistan, goes back to 1988.  That is the year in which the explosion at the al-Yarmuk Cinema  in al-Baq'ah took place. However, the repeated travel by their  leaders to Afghanistan and the Philippines, and the discovery of  'Muhammad's Army', which carried out similar acts, prompted  those individuals to suspend their activities in Jordan.    The security official continues: Some of those who returned  from Afghanistan and who have been arrested are members of the  Islamic Action Front Party. However, the Front had nothing to  do with their acts. He indicated that this ""organization,"" if  one can call it that, is composed of two groups: The first,  which is the smaller of the two, carried out the al-Yarmuk  Cinema bombing in 1988. The second, includes the leaders as  well as the first group. [as published].    The security official said that 'Abdallah Kamul  al-Hashayikah, who belongs to the Muslim Brothers, is the leader  of this organization, and that Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ayyad is the  second man in the organization. The security official revealed  that this organization endeavors to promote the spirit of jihad  and raises the jihad slogan through the Islamic world. It seeks  to eliminate vileness and to strike at the dens of corruption.  He explained that it became clear from the investigation of the  defendants in the bombing operations that their motive was  opposition to what they termed as capitulation. They also  targeted theaters and liquor stores out of their belief that  they play a vile role and should be uprooted as a religious  duty. They believe there is no alternative to the use of force  by bombing operations.    The security official indicated that the bombing scheme was  not confined to the bombings at the Rivoli and Salva theaters.  An explosive charge was placed in a toffee box at the 'Akrush  stores in Safut [a village between Amman and al-Baq'ah refugee  camp], but failed to explode. A similar charge was placed at  the Zahran Cinema in Amman. He said that investigations  revealed that first class hotels in Amman were also a target.  Furthermore, the investigations revealed a plan to assassinate  political figures in the Jordanian and Palestinian peace  delegations. However, President Yasir 'Arafat's name was not  among them because they could not monitor his movements, but  they were following the movements of members of the Jordanian  and Palestinian delegations.    The security official revealed that the defendants  intensified their activities during the month of January this  year because the main financier of their operations and plans, a  Saudi citizen working with Usamah Bin Ladin, was planning to  visit Jordan. The official continued to identify the financiers  of the organization by saying that: Usamah Bin-Ladin is a  wealthy Saudi who lives outside Saudi Arabia and is known for  supporting extremist Islamic movements around the world. He was  a friend of the late 'Abdallah 'Azzam, the spiritual leader of  the Jordanian Afghans.    On the relationship between what took place in Jordan and  what is taking place in Egypt, the official said the defendants  had no links to the fundamentalist organizations that are  responsible for bombings in Egypt. However, some of the  defendants confessed to their admiration for what is happening  in Egypt and Algeria.    He said most defendants had confessed to the charges against  them, and that quantities of dynamite and raw materials used for  making homemade explosives, such as acetone peroxide, a highly  explosive material, in addition to a few pistols and machine  guns, were discovered at their homes. He did not rule out the  fact that other weapons may have been hidden because the arrest  of some defendants was expected after some of their colleagues  were arrested.    The security official suggested a link between this  organization, to which he did not give a name, and Muhammad's  Army. However, he said that there is an organizational  interconnection, but not organizational relations between the  two. He denied that any of the defendants in the bombings were  members of Muhammad's Army.    On how the organization and the defendants were uncovered,  the official said that the first link in the chain was defendant  'Id al- Jahhali, who was injured in the theater explosion. At  first, he was moved with the other injured people who were  inside the theater. However, the forensic experts had suspicions  about his injuries because he lost his two legs and a finger.  Thus, when his condition, described as critical, improved, he  was interrogated by security men. He admitted he had placed the  explosive charge in the theater. He said he waited for a while  before leaving to avoid suspicion, but got carried away watching  the movie and the charge exploded under his seat. The official  said al-Jahhalin admitted to the names of those who carried out  the bombings with him. They were led by Muhammad 'Ali  Abu-'Ayyad, who gave him the explosive charge and who supervised  all the bombing operations.    The security official concluded by affirming that the  judicial circles have started interrogating the defendants and  that a charge sheet will most likely be ready in 3 weeks. He  refused to reveal where the defendants are being detained. He  merely said that ""they are being held in an officially  recognized prison.""     "

As two men arrested at one of the farms were charged with possession and  cultivation of the drug, deputies looking for evidence of additional growing  sites served search warrants at ""several locations"" in the Antelope Valley,  said Stephen L. Cooley, head of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's  office.    No arrests were made, but Cooley said new arrests and raids on additional  plantations were possible.    Authorities also conducted searches Sunday in Barstow and Palm Desert but found  no farms, said Sheriff's Capt. Larry Waldie, commander of the narcotics bureau.    Meanwhile, Lancaster Municipal Judge Ian R. Grant set bail at $1 million for  Ronald Podratz and Calvin James, two men described as caretakers at an estate  east of Lancaster where deputies Thursday confiscated 6,000 marijuana plants  and high-technology growing equipment from an underground bunker.    The arraignment of Podratz and James was continued until Nov. 27 at the request  of their court-appointed attorneys. The two face up to three years in prison if  convicted of charges of possession and cultivation of marijuana for sale.    Prosecutors will decide today whether to charge a third suspect being held in  Lancaster, Richard Yerger Jr., Cooley said. Documents indicate that Yerger, who  surrendered in Long Beach Saturday, owns the property containing the marijuana  farm near Lancaster, but prosecutors said they were looking for further  evidence.    Yerger's father, Richard E. Yerger, was still being sought for questioning,  deputies said. Documents show the elder Yerger, owner of a Lancaster  contracting firm, owns a house in the desert community of Llano where a raid  Friday turned up a second marijuana plantation that was smaller but more  sophisticated than the first, authorities said. The farms are about 20 miles  apart.    The Yergers and Frank Gegax, a Lancaster contractor in federal custody in Los  Angeles, are believed to have played ""high-level"" roles in the operation, a  federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent said Monday. Gegax, owner of KMG  Construction Inc. in Lancaster, surrendered to deputies Thursday and was  charged in Phoenix Friday with conspiracy to possess marijuana for sale.    The DEA agent, who declined to be identified, said investigators believe the  Yergers and Gegax financed the plantations, which authorities say cost about $1  million to construct and produced a harvest worth between $75 million and $150  million on the street.    Cooley would not comment on that description. He said investigators are still  trying to determine the scope of the case, which also involves two additional  underground marijuana farms in Arizona.    Federal agents in Phoenix are holding six suspects after an Oct. 30 raid on  those sites, which DEA agent John Albano described Monday as the DEA's largest  seizure ever at an underground operation.    Prosecutors in Lancaster said both Gegax and the Yergers had the construction  expertise needed to build the elaborate plantations. The Lancaster plantation  appeared to have been in operation for at least two years, authorities said.    Authorities also noted that Richard Yerger Inc. was the general contractor and  KMG was a subcontractor on a Lancaster senior citizen housing complex under  construction that was destroyed in a $4-million fire in November, 1987. Arson  investigators suspected that the fire was deliberately set but no arrests were  made.    Authorities said the arson investigation may be reopened as a result of the  arrests of Gegax and the younger Yerger, who reportedly worked in his father's  firm.    In an interview Monday, Richard Yerger Jr.'s brother-in-law -- Alfred Brand of  Sebastopol in Northern California -- said the construction firm has been in  difficult financial straits for the past three years as a result of the 1987  fire and expensive litigation that ensued.    ""They were essentially shut down because of the arson,"" Brand said. Brand said  he found it hard to believe that the Yergers could take part in the expensive  marijuana production operation because of their financial problems.

SERRANO and JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writers      SAN DIEGO      Assembling an elite team of experts and assigning the case ""the very highest  priority,"" federal officials intensified their investigation Saturday into the  pipe-bombing of a van being driven by the wife of Will Rogers III, captain of  the San Diego-based guided missile cruiser Vincennes.    Searching for hard evidence linking the bombing to international terrorists,  about 30 federal investigators meticulously combed a La Jolla intersection with  brooms and metal detectors, sweeping through plants, trees and construction  sites, and even the nearby roofs of stores and shops. The burned-out vehicle,  from which Sharon Rogers escaped uninjured from the bombing attack Friday, was  towed from the scene about 5 p.m. Saturday.      Mistaken Attack    Capt. Rogers ordered the Vincennes to fire on an approaching aircraft last July  while the ship was on duty in the Persian Gulf, mistakenly thinking the plane  was an attacking Iranian jet fighter. Instead, it was an Iranian commercial  jetliner, which was brought down, killing all 290 people aboard. Iranian  leaders at the time vowed revenge for the deaths.    Meanwhile Saturday, the Navy confirmed reports in The New York Times and  Washington Post from anonymous sources in Washington that Sharon Rogers had  received a threatening telephone call last summer. On Friday, a Navy spokesman  had repeatedly denied there had been such a threat. He said Saturday that he  had been unaware of the episode, despite reports that a security alert went out  to all 350 members of the Vincennes crew after the Navy was notified of the  call.    At the scene of the bombing Saturday, ""teams of investigators are running out  just hundreds and hundreds of leads,"" said Tom A. Hughes, special agent in  charge of the FBI office in San Diego.    ""There are fragments that would lead one to believe this is a pipe bomb,"" he  added.    But, he said, ""we're not in a position to confirm what kind of device it was.""    Navy sources in Washington and San Diego said Saturday that they were  hesitating to label the attack a clear-cut case of political terrorism because  other motives had not been ruled out. ""We're really not sure it's a terrorist.  It could be a disgruntled sailor or something else altogether,"" one source  said.      'Highest Priority'    ""The FBI has assigned the very highest priority to this case, but hasn't made  the call on whether it's a terrorist act or not, although it sure looks that  way,"" said one high law enforcement official in the nation's capital.    Another Navy source pointed to the attempted bombing of a car belonging to  Capt. Kenneth R. Barry, commanding officer of the Pelelieu, an amphibious  helicopter landing ship based in Long Beach. That incident was blamed on a  disgruntled sailor, the source said.    Barry escaped injury in March, 1987, when a pipe bomb rigged to his car failed  to go off.    Meanwhile, FBI Director William Sessions said in a press conference in Des  Moines Saturday that Friday's bombing does not signal a ""trend"" in  international terrorism.    ""I don't think we're seeing a trend at all,"" Sessions said.    But, he added, ""We are deeply concerned about that kind of activity -- whether  it is in fact a terrorist act. You just can't tell at this stage.""    As a result of the bombing in San Diego on Friday, security was tightened at  all Navy and Marine Corps installations in the area, and some rank-and-file  sailors outside the 32nd Street Naval Station -- the main naval yard here --  said their superiors had cautioned them to be watchful.    Rodney Vardoman, a 20-year-old sailor from St. Louis who is based in San Diego,  said, ""They tell us how to watch our backs,"" referring to the increased  security. ""They told us to be more careful and take precautions.""      No Worldwide Order    In Washington, Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, a Navy spokesman, said Saturday that no  order has gone out to increase security at Navy installations worldwide as a  result of the incident in San Diego. However, he said that some bases decided  to tighten security on their own and were taking such measures as stopping cars  and checking for identification instead of waving cars with decals through the  gates.    At Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in Washington state, United Press  International reported that the base commander had ordered heightened security  inasmuch as Whidbey-based naval ships had engaged in exchanges of fire with  Iran vessels.    The pipe bomb explosion Friday ripped through the Toyota van as Sharon Rogers  was en route to her job at a La Jolla private elementary school. Hearing what  sounded like two loud noises from underneath the vehicle, she initially thought  a motorist had struck her from behind. Moments after she stepped out to inspect  any possible damage, the van exploded into a fireball.    In his account of the phone threat received by Sharon Rogers, Navy spokesman  Cmdr. David Dillon said the call came at the Rogers' San Diego home two or  three days after the Iranian plane was shot down last July 3.      Phone Conversation    Dillon, a spokesman for the Pacific Surface Fleet, gave this account of the  conversation:    Caller: ""Is this Mrs. Rogers?""    Sharon Rogers: ""Who's this?""    Caller: ""Is this Mrs. Rogers?""    Sharon Rogers: Who is this?""    Caller: ""Are you the wife of the murderer?""    Sharon Rogers then hung up the phone and nothing further was heard from the  man, Dillon said.    He said the incident was reported to the Naval Investigative Service and added  that he knows of no other incidents approaching a threat to Rogers, his wife,  or other Vincennes crew members.    Rogers and his wife were trying to maintain a low profile Saturday and have  decided not to speak to reporters, Dillon said. ""We have them in a safe place,""  Dillon said. ""Suddenly, it got very personal.""    At the scene of the bombing, the 30 investigators, including experts from the  FBI bomb laboratory in Los Angeles and the agency's explosives unit in  Washington, delicately marked, examined and removed almost every shred of  debris along the normally busy intersection.    ""This is the cleanest street in San Diego,"" said San Diego Police Officer  Thomas Mason, who was guarding the perimeter from crowds of motorists,  bicyclists and other spectators.      Hoisted Into Air    Most of the federal agents, clad in Windbreakers, blue jumpsuits or suits and  ties, worked throughout the day Saturday. By early afternoon, they were  clustered around the vehicle as a Navy forklift hoisted the burned-out van five  feet into the air.

SERRANO and JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writers      SAN DIEGO      Assembling an elite team of experts and assigning the case ""the very highest  priority,"" federal officials intensified their investigation Saturday into the  pipe-bombing of a van being driven by the wife of Will Rogers III, captain of  the San Diego-based guided missile cruiser Vincennes.    Searching for hard evidence linking the bombing to international terrorists,  about 30 federal investigators meticulously combed a La Jolla intersection with  brooms and metal detectors, sweeping through plants, trees and construction  sites, and even the nearby roofs of stores and shops. The burned-out vehicle,  from which Sharon Rogers escaped uninjured from the bombing attack Friday, was  towed from the scene about 5 p.m. Saturday.      Mistaken Attack    Capt. Rogers ordered the Vincennes to fire on an approaching aircraft last July  while the ship was on duty in the Persian Gulf, mistakenly thinking the plane  was an attacking Iranian jet fighter. Instead, it was an Iranian commercial  jetliner, which was brought down, killing all 290 people aboard. Iranian  leaders at the time vowed revenge for the deaths.    Meanwhile Saturday, the Navy confirmed reports in The New York Times and  Washington Post from anonymous sources in Washington that Sharon Rogers had  received a threatening telephone call last summer. On Friday, a Navy spokesman  had repeatedly denied there had been such a threat. He said Saturday that he  had been unaware of the episode, despite reports that a security alert went out  to all 350 members of the Vincennes crew after the Navy was notified of the  call.    At the scene of the bombing Saturday, ""teams of investigators are running out  just hundreds and hundreds of leads,"" said Tom A. Hughes, special agent in  charge of the FBI office in San Diego.    ""There are fragments that would lead one to believe this is a pipe bomb,"" he  added.    But, he said, ""we're not in a position to confirm what kind of device it was.""    Navy sources in Washington and San Diego said Saturday that they were  hesitating to label the attack a clear-cut case of political terrorism because  other motives had not been ruled out. ""We're really not sure it's a terrorist.  It could be a disgruntled sailor or something else altogether,"" one source  said.      'Highest Priority'    ""The FBI has assigned the very highest priority to this case, but hasn't made  the call on whether it's a terrorist act or not, although it sure looks that  way,"" said one high law enforcement official in the nation's capital.    Another Navy source pointed to the attempted bombing of a car belonging to  Capt. Kenneth R. Barry, commanding officer of the Pelelieu, an amphibious  helicopter landing ship based in Long Beach. That incident was blamed on a  disgruntled sailor, the source said.    Barry escaped injury in March, 1987, when a pipe bomb rigged to his car failed  to go off.    Meanwhile, FBI Director William Sessions said in a press conference in Des  Moines Saturday that Friday's bombing does not signal a ""trend"" in  international terrorism.    ""I don't think we're seeing a trend at all,"" Sessions said.    But, he added, ""We are deeply concerned about that kind of activity -- whether  it is in fact a terrorist act. You just can't tell at this stage.""    As a result of the bombing in San Diego on Friday, security was tightened at  all Navy and Marine Corps installations in the area, and some rank-and-file  sailors outside the 32nd Street Naval Station -- the main naval yard here --  said their superiors had cautioned them to be watchful.    Rodney Vardoman, a 20-year-old sailor from St. Louis who is based in San Diego,  said, ""They tell us how to watch our backs,"" referring to the increased  security. ""They told us to be more careful and take precautions.""      No Worldwide Order    In Washington, Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, a Navy spokesman, said Saturday that no  order has gone out to increase security at Navy installations worldwide as a  result of the incident in San Diego. However, he said that some bases decided  to tighten security on their own and were taking such measures as stopping cars  and checking for identification instead of waving cars with decals through the  gates.    At Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in Washington state, United Press  International reported that the base commander had ordered heightened security  inasmuch as Whidbey-based naval ships had engaged in exchanges of fire with  Iran vessels.    The pipe bomb explosion Friday ripped through the Toyota van as Sharon Rogers  was en route to her job at a La Jolla private elementary school. Hearing what  sounded like two loud noises from underneath the vehicle, she initially thought  a motorist had struck her from behind. Moments after she stepped out to inspect  any possible damage, the van exploded into a fireball.    In his account of the phone threat received by Sharon Rogers, Navy spokesman  Cmdr. David Dillon said the call came at the Rogers' San Diego home two or  three days after the Iranian plane was shot down last July 3.      Phone Conversation    Dillon, a spokesman for the Pacific Surface Fleet, gave this account of the  conversation:    Caller: ""Is this Mrs. Rogers?""    Sharon Rogers: ""Who's this?""    Caller: ""Is this Mrs. Rogers?""    Sharon Rogers: Who is this?""    Caller: ""Are you the wife of the murderer?""    Sharon Rogers then hung up the phone and nothing further was heard from the  man, Dillon said.    He said the incident was reported to the Naval Investigative Service and added  that he knows of no other incidents approaching a threat to Rogers, his wife,  or other Vincennes crew members.    Rogers and his wife were trying to maintain a low profile Saturday and have  decided not to speak to reporters, Dillon said. ""We have them in a safe place,""  Dillon said. ""Suddenly, it got very personal.""    At the scene of the bombing, the 30 investigators, including experts from the  FBI bomb laboratory in Los Angeles and the agency's explosives unit in  Washington, delicately marked, examined and removed almost every shred of  debris along the normally busy intersection.    ""This is the cleanest street in San Diego,"" said San Diego Police Officer  Thomas Mason, who was guarding the perimeter from crowds of motorists,  bicyclists and other spectators.      Hoisted Into Air    Most of the federal agents, clad in Windbreakers, blue jumpsuits or suits and  ties, worked throughout the day Saturday. By early afternoon, they were  clustered around the vehicle as a Navy forklift hoisted the burned-out van five  feet into the air.    With a photographer snapping pictures of the van's charred rear undercarriage,  FBI agents wearing white gloves sifted through blackened debris on the  pavement. Plainly visible from the police perimeter were charred strips of the  van's rear tires.

0,FT931-14926 ,"FT931-14926 _AN-DAOB4ADNFT 930115   FT  15 JAN 93 / Uncertain success: Military objectives were achieved, but there is doubt over political goals      By DAVID WHITE   Little went wrong. But the success of the swift return visit to Iraqi battlefields by the US and its British and French allies will be measured not by how well it was done but by what it achieved. Militarily it was impressively executed. Co-ordinating a bombing attack involving 110 aircraft and bringing them all back is no mean feat. In those terms, the US-led strike compared favourably with the operation most closely comparable - the punitive US bombing raid against Libya in April 1986. Then, despite the involvement of large numbers of ships and aircraft, military plans were only partly fulfilled and one aircraft was lost over target. This time, the allies had plenty of time to plan and study a whole range of 'target sets', and enjoyed the benefit of their weeks of rehearsal two years ago in the air campaign against Iraq. The sites were well known, and in most cases had been attacked before. But whereas the semi-botched bombing of Libya did apparently succeed - in retrospect - in placing a restraint on Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the outcome of the 'spanking' of President Saddam Hussein is far from certain. The damage caused in the precision-bombing attacks was yesterday still being evaluated. The Pentagon said Iraq's southern air defences had been 'seriously degraded'. But it is questionable how much President Saddam perceives this as a setback, since it was an attack that he deliberately provoked, and the outcome of which was never in doubt. Iraqi forces put up little opposition - possibly because, as in 1991, they knew they were unable to. Mr Saddam's ostensible purpose was to show that international action against Iraq was a US campaign founded on dubious legality, and to use that to obtain support from Islamic countries for easing sanctions. Expressions of concern yesterday by Syria and Pakistan indicated this argument may have struck some chords. The UN Security Council's Resolution 688 of April 1991 did not go beyond telling Iraq to stop repressing its minorities and to allow access to humanitarian organisations. The justification of the US and its allies is that they need to monitor what is happening in these regions, can only do so by air, and need to ensure that they can do so safely. The air strikes were limited to air-defence systems - missile sites and radar and command facilities - inside the no-fly zone which the US, Britain and France imposed in August south of the 32nd parallel. Air bases to the north of the line were not attacked, as many analysts had expected, even though they have been used for recent incursions by Iraqi fighters, including the MiG-25 shot down by a US F-16 on December 27. However, any further allied military action could well include targets further into Iraq. The bombing raids were the first concerted attack against Iraq since hostilities closed in February 1991, although the allies have repeatedly wielded the threat of military action: to force the withdrawal of Iraqi forces so that Kurds could move back into a haven, to obtain access for UN weapons inspectors, and to ensure the destruction of missile-making equipment. Allied officials stressed that the attacks were on military installations directly threatening their own aircraft. But the political objective behind the attack remains vague. In the Gulf war, the declared aim was to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait. This was extended to include the crippling of Iraq's offensive military capability, with a further aim - implicitly understood - of creating conditions in which President Saddam might fall. Only after the war did the allies face public criticism in the west for not going further and - as General Norman Schwarzkopf said his forces could have done when they thrust northwards into Iraq - turning left towards Baghdad instead of right. The message the allies now appear to be giving is that they will keep up sanctions and be ready to attack periodically until Iraq moderates its behaviour. But the political goal which military escalation - if it comes to that - would serve is still not explicit.   Countries:-  IQZ  Iraq, Middle East.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The seizure and the arrests of five Colombian nationals, however, were made in  Los Angeles County.    Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said four days of investigation  took narcotics detectives from Simi Valley to Newhall and Chatsworth before the  arrests.    At 2:30 p.m. Thursday, officers stopped a car under surveillance on the Golden  State Freeway in Newhall and found 277 pounds of the drug, Miller said. They  arrested the driver, Angelo Alviro, 41, whose address is unknown, Miller said.    Later, investigators served search warrants at houses in Chatsworth and  Newhall.    At a house in the 9600 block of Gierson Avenue in Chatsworth, investigators  found 1,791 pounds of cocaine in a van parked in the garage and arrested Roceo  Campo, 26, Miller said.    At a house in the 25000 block of Wintergreen Court in Newhall, no drugs were  found but three people were arrested. They were identified as Efraim  Belalclzar, 38, and Derly De La Cruz, 27, both of Newhall, and Francisco  Altoreilo, 28, of Sepulveda.    All five were being held on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance.    Miller declined to reveal details of the investigation but said it was  connected with his department's seizure in May of $2.5 million in suspected  drug profits and the arrests of one Guatemalan and three Colombian nationals in  Simi Valley and Chatsworth. The four were not charged because no drugs were  found, but were later deported. The cash was seized under state forfeiture  statutes.    He said the investigation that led to the most recent arrests is continuing. He  noted that his department was joined by federal agents, Ventura County  sheriff's deputies and the district attorney's office.    Responding to a U. S. Attorney General's report earlier this month, which said  Southern California is an importing point for as much as half the cocaine  brought to the United States, Miller said large busts may become more  prevalent.    Despite the size of the seizure, Miller said he believes that more cocaine is  being distributed.    ""This is not the destruction"" of this one drug ring, he said. But ""it will set  them back.""

0,FT921-5896 ,"FT921-5896 _AN-CCBBHAAQFT 920302   FT  02 MAR 92 / Hand over bomb suspects, Russia urges Libyans      By TONY WALKER and REUTER      CAIRO, NICOSIA   RUSSIAN Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev yesterday urged Libya to hand over to the United Nations secretary-general two Libyans accused of bombing a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives. Mr Kozyrev made his comments to his Libyan counterpart, Mr Ibrahim Mohammed Beshari, in Cairo at a private meeting in the Russian embassy. 'I suggested to my Libyan friend that Libya should go along with the Security Council resolutions because this is the best way out in solving this problem,' Mr Kozyrev told reporters after a meeting with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. Mr Mubarak returned to Cairo at the weekend after visiting France and Morocco. He has been attempting to defuse a potential international crisis over Libya's refusal to yield the two Libyans for trial in either the US or Britain. France is also seeking four Libyans, including Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi's brother-in-law, for questioning over the 1989 bombing of a UTA jet over Niger, in which 171 passengers and crew died. Pointedly, the French judge responsible for investigating terrorism cases issued international arrest warrants for the four Libyans while Mr Mubarak was in Paris urging the west to show restraint. The US, Britain and France are working on a Security Council resolution that would impose limited sanctions against Libya should it continue to refuse to hand over the Libyan suspects. Initial sanctions would include a freeze on civil aviation links and a suspension of diplomatic relations. Sweden, meanwhile, has rejected a Libyan request for it to host the trial of the two Libyans suspected of blowing up the Pan Am jet. A spokesman for Sweden's foreign ministry said the government had decided to turn down the request, forwarded last Monday. The official said the trial should be held where the crime took place. He also urged Libya to abide by Security Council Resolution 731 of January 21 which condemned the bombings and urged Libya to comply with requests to hand over the suspects. The Libyan judge investigating the Lockerbie airliner bombing submitted his resignation yesterday, saying he was being pressed from all sides to violate the law, Reuter adds from Nicosia. The judge gave nine reasons why he could not conduct his investigation properly, including 'insults to the Libyan judiciary ..political pressures from inside and outside ..and attempts to force me to violate the laws,' according to the Libyan news agency JANA.

WILLIAMS Jr., Times Staff Writer      NICOSIA, Cyprus      Glass and shrapnel from an exploding car bomb Friday raked a crowded bakery in  suburban Beirut. Lebanese police reported 12 shoppers were killed and at least  75 wounded.    The toll was the highest this year for a Beirut car bomb. Thirteen people have  been killed in four previous explosions.    None of Lebanon's militant factions claimed responsibility for the bombing,  which occurred during the morning rush hour in Jal el Deeb, a suburb of  Christian-controlled East Beirut.    The blast shattered the relative calm of a 10-hour-old truce in the running  artillery duels between Muslim and Christian gunners. It destroyed the bakery,  damaged adjoining shops and set 20 cars afire in the street. Windows in the  consulate building of the British Embassy, just 50 yards distant, were broken  by the force of the bomb, which police estimated at more than 100 pounds of  explosives.    Many of the casualties, some grotesquely maimed, were children who had joined  their parents to line up for bread during the break in the artillery shelling,  according to reports from Beirut.    Salim Hoss, head of the Muslim caretaker government in West Beirut, called the  bombing a mass murder. ""Civilians whether in the East or West are being  victimized,"" he said.    Gen. Michel Aoun, head of the rival Christian government in East Beirut, blamed  the bombing on the Syrians, who support the Hoss regime and maintain security  in the western half of the divided capital. An Aoun communique accused the  Syrians of trying to provoke a renewal of the artillery war between his mainly  Christian Lebanese Army troops and the Syrian-backed forces of Druze leader  Walid Jumblatt.    The two sides have been exchanging fire for the past nine days, triggered by  Aoun's blockade of ports controlled by Muslim militia south of Beirut. The  so-called War of the Ports -- harbors are prime revenue producers for both  government and militia forces -- has taken 49 lives, and is considered the  worst outbreak of Christian-Muslim fighting in four years.    Another Christian force, the rightist Falangist Party, implied in a Voice of  Lebanon radio broadcast that the car bomb was related to the controversy over  Salman Rushdie's novel ""The Satanic Verses."" The author went into hiding in  Britain late last month when the Iranian leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini, demanded his assassination for writing what Khomeini called  blasphemies against the Muslim religion.    ""The British Embassy has received death threats,"" Falangist radio said, noting  the proximity of the bombing to the embassy.    According to press dispatches from Beirut, Lebanese guards at the embassy fired  into the air to keep reporters from approaching the grounds. No casualties were  reported at the embassy.

Windows in the  consulate building of the British Embassy, just 50 yards distant, were broken  by the force of the bomb, which police estimated at more than 100 pounds of  explosives.    Many of the casualties, some grotesquely maimed, were children who had joined  their parents to line up for bread during the break in the artillery shelling,  according to reports from Beirut.    Salim Hoss, head of the Muslim caretaker government in West Beirut, called the  bombing a mass murder. ""Civilians whether in the East or West are being  victimized,"" he said.    Gen. Michel Aoun, head of the rival Christian government in East Beirut, blamed  the bombing on the Syrians, who support the Hoss regime and maintain security  in the western half of the divided capital. An Aoun communique accused the  Syrians of trying to provoke a renewal of the artillery war between his mainly  Christian Lebanese Army troops and the Syrian-backed forces of Druze leader  Walid Jumblatt.    The two sides have been exchanging fire for the past nine days, triggered by  Aoun's blockade of ports controlled by Muslim militia south of Beirut. The  so-called War of the Ports -- harbors are prime revenue producers for both  government and militia forces -- has taken 49 lives, and is considered the  worst outbreak of Christian-Muslim fighting in four years.    Another Christian force, the rightist Falangist Party, implied in a Voice of  Lebanon radio broadcast that the car bomb was related to the controversy over  Salman Rushdie's novel ""The Satanic Verses."" The author went into hiding in  Britain late last month when the Iranian leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini, demanded his assassination for writing what Khomeini called  blasphemies against the Muslim religion.    ""The British Embassy has received death threats,"" Falangist radio said, noting  the proximity of the bombing to the embassy.    According to press dispatches from Beirut, Lebanese guards at the embassy fired  into the air to keep reporters from approaching the grounds. No casualties were  reported at the embassy.

Commenting today on Sha'ban's confession, Hamid said there  is  another piece of evidence proving that Libya is not involved in  the bombing: The president of the Swiss company that produced  the timer used in the bombing retracted his testimony, on the  basis of which Libya was condemned.    Hamid said the Arab League dealt with the Libyan-Western  crisis objectively and rationally in accordance with the UN and  Arab League Charters.    He said the Arab League's proposal that the two Libyan  suspects be tried by a Scottish panel of judges in the  International Court of Justice in The Hague was meant as a  chance for a fair trial based on the legal rule that the suspect  is innocent until proven guilty.    Hamid described the West's solid rejection of any peaceful  solutions to the crisis as lacking in an objective justification.     "

Panferov, deputy of the State  Duma: ""Anxious Expectation. Sunday February 20 NATO Ultimatum  to Bosnian Serbs Expires. Discussion in the Duma""]    [Text] The bombing of the territory of the former  Yugoslavia must not be allowed -- that demand was expressed in  all the speeches from Russian State Duma deputies at the  parliamentary hearings held by the State Duma's Committee on  Questions of Geopolitics under the chairmanship of the  historian, Viktor Ustinov.    During the discussion N. Stolyarov, the committee's deputy  chairman, asked this question: Will peace reign as a result of  the planned and coordinated third-party intervention in the  Balkan crisis? ""It may be said unambiguously and with a great  degree of accuracy: No, no, no!"" he said. The possible bombing  of the Bosnian Serbs will be the result of an inhuman and  dishonest political game. Russia must in no circumstances be a  party to this conflict.    A. Frolov, a member of the Geopolitics Committee, stressed  that since Russia's withdrawal from the ranks of the great  powers all the peacemaking missions conducted under the UN flag  have turned into unilateral interference in the internal affairs  of various states. Today we are seeing NATO's anti-Serb  tendency. With regard to this conflict Russia, regrettably, has  for a long time now not had a position of its own based on its  national and state interests.    Deputy Mikhaylov, a spokesman for the Defense Committee,  focused his speech on the fact that the present situation on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia is a consequence of the  shortsighted position taken by Russia on the Balkans. Russia's  leaders must do everything possible to prevent the barbarous and  inhuman bombing action.    Deputy N. Krivelskaya from the Security Committee asked  representatives of the Foreign Ministry: If Russia does not  exercise its right of veto in the Security Council, how will  Russia's foreign policy line be implemented at all?    In the course of the hearings parliamentarians came to the  conclusion that the UN Security Council's imposition of economic  sanctions on Yugoslavia, sanctions which Russia supported, has  done tremendous harm both to Yugoslavia itself and to other  countries and has shown itself to be completely ineffective.  Russia cannot accept the fact of air strikes against the Serb  positions because this act goes beyond the framework of the UN  Security Council's decision under Article 40 of the UN Charter.  Russia cannot accept the thrust of an ultimatum directed  against the Serbs alone. The State Duma asks all the warring  sides to call a cease-fire, completely demilitarize the Sarajevo  region, withdraw the troops and heavy artillery from the city,  and place the Sarajevo region under UN control. The deputies of  the Russian State Duma take the initiative of asking the  parliaments of the UN member states to immediately convene a  special conference on the settlement of the conflict by peaceful  means.

They have  been positively linked to the Heidelberg Tavern killings, Mr  Kriel said in a statement. ""These arrests brings to four the  number of suspects being held in connection with this attack.  Further arrests are not excluded,"" the statement said.    Both suspects, aged 24 and 22, were arrested earlier this  week in Elliot in South African territory whilst travelling  between two destinations in the Trankskei.    The arrest of the two members of the Pan Africanist  Congress'  [PAC] armed wing, coupled with investigations, had verified the  finding by the Goldstone Commission that the Transkei was indeed  a ""safe haven for killers exporting terrorism to South Africa"",  Mr Kriel said.    The South African Police [SAP] was investigating whether all  four suspects were linked to other terror atrocities in the  western Cape. This ""major breakthrough"" further emphasised the  urgent necessity for the Transkei to co-operate in establishing  a joint SAP/Transkei police investigation team to further probe  the matter, said Mr Kriel.

0,FT921-2687 ,"FT921-2687 _AN-CCRBLAD4FT 920318   FT  18 MAR 92 / US, UK and France agree Libya sanctions resolution      By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent      LONDON   THE US, Britain and France have agreed on a draft United Nations resolution imposing sanctions on Libya, including a ban on all air links with the country, for its alleged part in the bombing of civil airliners over Scotland and Niger. The draft text calls on all UN countries to deny all civil flights to and from Libya, to halt the supply of arms and related materials to the country and to downgrade the status and reduce the size of Libyan diplomatic missions. The resolution would also ban sales of aircraft or avionic spare parts to Libya and all new insurance for Libyan civil airliners. It would prevent the operations of Libyan Arab airline offices overseas. The UK foreign office yesterday advised 5,500 Britons registered as resident in Libya that they should 'consider carefully' leaving the country in view of the possible flight ban. The draft resolution was circulated yesterday among other Security Council members. Diplomats in New York suggested Russia would probably support the present text, but China, Zimbabwe and Morocco could resist it. But officials from the three drafting powers say they are reasonably confident the resolution will pass. If so, the sanctions would take effect within 24 hours of the vote. The Security Council in January unanimously ordered Libya to surrender two agents accused of masterminding the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 in which 270 people died. The French have also sought four suspects thought to be behind the bombing of a UTA flight over Niger in 1989 in which 171 were killed. In a sign that Col Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, is feeling under pressure from western demands, Libya made a series of offers to resolve the confrontation with Britain, the US and France after talks with a UN envoy in Tripoli earlier this month. But these were considered by the three countries to be confused and inadequate. Col Gadaffi has separately opened an action against the US and Britain at the World Court in The Hague, accusing them of breaking international law by failing to hand over to Libya the evidence allegedly pointing to Libyan complicity in the bombings. The Court is due to hold a preliminary hearing on the action on March 26. The US TV network ABC yesterday appealed to the High Court in London against a police demand for all material relating to ABC interviews with the two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing. Judgment was reserved.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The arms store was discovered  in the Guipuzcoa town of Usurbil, concealed in the home of a  collaborator of the ETA unit. The arsenal comprises 40  kilograms of explosives, several rifles, pistols, shotguns,  grenades and other materiel. The first arrests were made during  Saturday night, in Usurbil and Orio; seven more people were  arrested in the early hours of this morning in Usurbil, Lasarte  and Oyarzun.     "

In a search of the vehicle Thursday, deputies said  they recovered ledgers containing names of more bettors and betting agents. It  was the latest development in the case, which has resulted in the arrests of  eight people on suspicion of running the ring out of restaurants and residences  in Orange and Los Angeles counties.    ""The new evidence will surely firm up our cases, and as we analyze the  information, more arrests may follow,"" Investigator Larry Vance said.    The Ford utility truck is registered to Vincent Marchionno, 40, of Fullerton.  Marchionno was among seven men and one woman arrested Tuesday night when  sheriff's deputies served search warrants on residences in Anaheim, Lakewood,  Bellflower and Norwalk. They also searched Spoons restaurants in Santa Ana and  Tustin and Shipmates Tavern in Cerritos, where some of the suspects worked.    Searches yielded ledgers and computerized records that Vance said appear to  contain the coded identities of hundreds of bettors. The operation allegedly  involved using employees of popular Orange County bars and restaurants as  agents to take bets on professional and collegiate baseball, football,  basketball, hockey and horse racing.    Deputies paid for the costs of their undercover investigation by placing  winning bets on basketball's Los Angeles Lakers and baseball's Oakland  Athletics, according to the Sheriff's Department.    Marchionno had refused deputies' request to search his vehicle when he and two  others were arrested at a Bellflower apartment Tuesday. Deputies alleged that  the men were accepting bets on the telephone when the arrests were made.    Vance said he secured a warrant to search Marchionno's truck Thursday and  confiscated betting slips and ledgers that he alleged could point investigators  to the ringleaders of the alleged $3-million-a-year operation.    When contacted at his home Thursday, Marchionno declined comment.    He has been released on $10,000 bail. Thomas Eric Stevens, 52, of Norwalk and  Mary Scallon, 25, a bookkeeper at Spoons in Tustin, were released after posting  $50,000 and $10,000 bail, respectively.    Vance said the suspects still in jail on suspicion of bookmaking and conspiracy  to commit bookmaking included two Spoons managers, Michael Dunn, 38, of Tustin  and Thomas Sullivan, 30, of Fullerton; also Robert Reed, 59, of Anaheim; Donald  Richard Trava, 37, of Lakewood, and Ian White, 30, of Bellflower.

When contacted at his home Thursday, Marchionno declined comment.    He has been released on $10,000 bail. Thomas Eric Stevens, 52, of Norwalk and  Mary Scallon, 25, a bookkeeper at Spoons in Tustin, were released after posting  $50,000 and $10,000 bail, respectively.    Vance said the suspects still in jail on suspicion of bookmaking and conspiracy  to commit bookmaking included two Spoons managers, Michael Dunn, 38, of Tustin  and Thomas Sullivan, 30, of Fullerton; also Robert Reed, 59, of Anaheim; Donald  Richard Trava, 37, of Lakewood, and Ian White, 30, of Bellflower. Bail for  Trava and Reed was set at $50,000 each, $10,000 for the others.

The report surfaced as Libya's North African neighbours, headed by Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, engaged in a flurry of meetings to try to head off UN Security Council moves to impose sanctions against Libya, including an arms and civil aviation embargo. In Tunis, an unidentified North African diplomat was quoted as saying that Arab states were 'intensively working' on a solution and that Libya had agreed in principle to surrender the two accused Libyan agents to the UN secretary-general. But British and US officials suggested that Libya might be seeking to win time before an eventual vote on a proposed Security Council resolution calling for sanctions - expected early next week. Britain and the US have demanded, backed by UN resolution 731, that Libya hand over the two men - Mr Abdul Basit Ali Magrahi and Mr Lamin Khalifa Fahima - for trial in either the US or Scotland. France has also demanded that Libya surrender four men suspected of bombing a UTA flight over Niger in 1989. US officials said Libya's unconditional surrender of the two men would suffice to forestall a vote on the UN resolution. Other western officials said the move might ease but not entirely remove pressure on Libya, since Tripoli, under the terms of resolution 731, should still hand over the men linked to the UTA bombing and disassociate itself from all acts of terrorism. Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's regime has wriggled uncomfortably under the pressure from the US, Britain and France. It has proposed a string of solutions short of western demands while stockpiling vital goods and shifting billions of dollars of overseas assets in case of sanctions. Anxiety among Libya's neighbours that Col Gadaffi's regime might be fatally destabilised by external pressure has prompted a concerted attempt to broker a solution, led by Egypt. In its scramble for a way out, Libya yesterday despatched a senior envoy to Riyadh to meet Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi foreign minister, while Major Khoueldi Hamidi, a Libyan defence official, held two sessions of talks with King Hassan of Morocco on Thursday.

Arab diplomats in Tunis reported that Libya's latest offer entailed handing over the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 wanted by the US and Britain for trial, but on condition they were not interrogated in either country. Tripoli reportedly proposed that the pair should be interrogated by the United Nations or a UN body. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, last night rejected the proposal while repeating his demand that Libya supply a written declaration that it will hand the two suspects to the US or Britain. British officials characterised the Libyan offer as vague and a further attempt to stall a UN Security Council vote to impose sanctions. They said the UN had neither the competence nor mechanism to deal with 'civil criminal matters'. Officials stressed that UN resolution 731 calls simply for the two men to be handed over to the US or Britain for trial. UN vote on sanctions, Page 4  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "

0,FT921-13848 ,"FT921-13848 _AN-CASAAAEDFT 920118   FT  18 JAN 92 / IRA kills seven civilians in Ulster bomb attack      By Our Belfast Correspondent   A MASSIVE IRA bomb killed seven men last night as they returned from work on an Ulster security force base in Co Tyrone. Seven others were hurt, one critically, when the 1,500lb-bomb ripped apart their transit van on the main Omagh to Cookstown road. They were at a place known locally as Teebane crossroads, a few miles from the Republican village of Carrickmore. It was the highest civilian death toll in the province since the IRA Poppy Day massacre at Enniskillen in 1987. The bombing followed warnings by the IRA that terrorist activity is set to increase, both in Ulster and on the UK mainland. In particular, the IRA said two weeks ago that it intended to step up its military activities in Ulster in 1992. It hopes to prevent effective political talks on the future of the province between the UK and Irish governments and between political parties in Northern Ireland. The failure so far by Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland Secretary, to stimulate cross-party dialogue ahead of the UK general election has enabled the terrorists to thrive in a political vacuum. Unionist politicians, outraged by the atrocity, called for an all-out military offensive against the terrorists. As tension rose in the province last night, there were fears that Loyalist paramilitary organisations would mount retaliatory attacks on Republicans. The Rev William McCrea, Democratic Unionist MP for mid-Ulster, said he had no doubt that the bombing was a carefully planned IRA operation. He said that the security forces should be given the scope to combat the IRA free from political interference. It emerged last night that the dead men had been carrying out work at the Lisanelly army base in Omagh. The IRA has carried out attacks on workers supplying or working with the security forces since 1985. Executives have been murdered, several firms have been forced out of business, while others have publicly withdrawn from security force contracts. The bombing will have far-reaching political implications. It is certain to re-open the debate about reintroducing internment, or detention without trial, of terrorist suspects. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist security spokesman and a former major in the Ulster Defence Regiment, said internment should be brought back immediately. Senior army commanders are understood to favour the move as one of the most effective methods of disrupting the IRA's command structure. Ulster talks, Page 4  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "

Amnesty International, the human rights organisation, urged China to release all those arrested. US officials in Beijing said they had been informed that three American citizens among the seven arrested had been released. Earlier this month, China gave notice that it was cracking down on foreign missionaries with the publication of new laws aimed at improving religious 'management'. News of the arrests of foreign Christians in central Henan province coincides with Beijing's efforts to persuade the outside world that it is improving its human rights record. President Clinton is obliged within the next few months to decide whether China has made an 'overall, significant improvement' in its human rights performance that would justify renewal of its Most Favoured Nation trading status. International human rights organisations including Amnesty International have intensified pressure on China and on the US administration in the lead-up to the MFN decision. An estimated 96 per cent of China's exports to the US are covered by MFN. China's new religious decree expressly bans foreigners from setting up religious organisations, schools or offices. Foreigners have also been forbidden to cultivate religious disciples among Chinese citizens, and appoint religious clergy.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.

Director Pantaleon Dumlao, PNP deputy chief for operations,  said the reward hopefully would encourage reluctant witnesses to  cooperate fully with the police.    The witnesses could even request anonymity, according to PNP  Director General Umberto Rodriguez.    A senior police officer said the reward was put up because  the PNP still cannot clearly establish which group or groups  carried out the bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral in Davao City  and the subsequent explosions at three mosques.    The police announced on Wednesday the arrest of two suspects  in the cathedral attack.    Intelligence reports indicated the two suspects, Abdul Munib  and a man identified only as Jacob, belong to the Abu Sayaf, a  Muslim extremist group. This has led police to deduce the Abu  Sayaf is behind the bombing of the cathedral.    But the police official said the police is ""still looking""  for more solid evidence against Munib and Jacob. So far,  investigators are going by intelligence reports which said that  the two arrived in Davao City from Jolo via Basilan on the last  week of November along with 23 other Abu Sayaf members.    ""Even if the Abu Sayaf really is responsible for the attack  on the cathedral,"" the source said, ""there is still the matter  of solving the bombing of the mosques.""    One police official in Davao is certain both the attacks on  the cathedral and on the mosques were made by only one group.    This group, according to Senior Superintendent Teddy Carian,  police regional director, is out to sow chaos in Mindanao.    ""There exists a group that is out to create chaos between  our  Muslim brothers and Christians. Their targets are religious  structures,"" Carian said.    During the joint meeting yesterday of the Regional Peace and  Order Council and the Regional Development Council, Carian said  the bombers have only one objective: ""Open a rift and create  animosities that will open hostilities between Christians and  Muslims in Mindanao.""    Carian and Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte also denied two  Muslim  men have been arrested as suspects in the cathedral bombing.    ""So far, there are no apprehensions made. No one is under  our custody,"" Carian said.    ""We are not in a hurry. We haven't arrested a single  suspect,"" Duterte said.    It was Senior Inspector Tadgiro Ainin, the Santa Ana police  chief, who announced the arrest of Munib and Jacob, who was  positively identified by at least five witnesses.    Carian said, ""The same criminal groups which initiated these  bombings in the first place,"" and a so-called ""New Christian  Democratic Army,"" which claimed responsibility for the attack on  the three mosques, was part of this group.    ""I should not wonder if later on, there will be another  group  claiming to be anti-Christian group,"" he added.     "

The van destroyed by bomb  blasts was being driven by the wife of the commander of the Vincennes, Will C.  Rogers III.    The bombing clearly took the Bush Administration by surprise. An international  alert was recently issued to U.S. military and diplomatic facilities on four  continents warning of potential Libyan attacks on April 15, the anniversary of  the 1986 U.S. bombing raid on Libya. And after the Iranian airliner was shot  down last July, killing all 290 on board, U.S. intelligence picked up  widespread indications that pro-Iranian groups were conducting reconnaissance  of American diplomatic missions in Europe.    But there was virtually no suggestion that foreign elements have planned to hit  a U.S. target inside this country, a counterterrorism official said. The State  Department also reported that Rogers had received no recent threats.    Indeed, one Bush Administration official said, there are reasons to believe  that international terrorism may not have been involved in the van blast. ""To  go after a military man was brazen and rather obvious. It is too obvious,"" he  said.    But in a reflection of the pervasive mood here, he added that, if the bombing  is proven to be a terrorist's work, ""Something will have to be done. They hit  us at home and that can't be tolerated.""    Private terrorism specialists acknowledged that they have considered an attack  on a U.S. target at home almost inevitable. ""There have been a whole bunch of  (unsuccessful) attempts in the past,"" Rand Corp. terrorism specialist Bruce  Hoffman said. ""Most law enforcement agencies have long been saying that it was  just a matter of time.""    Dozens of foreign groups have tried to hit U.S. targets since terrorism became  a weapon of modern warfare in 1968. The most recent was Yu Kikumura, a Japanese  Red Army member arrested a year ago and later convicted of planning to bomb a  military recruiting station in Manhattan.    An FBI official said Friday that there was another attempted terrorist act in  the United States involving ""a Mideast country"" that was headed off by agents  last year. The official declined to elaborate.    In 1986, two Libyan exchange students were arrested in Philadelphia in  possession of weapons. Authorities believe they had planned to attack either  U.S. facilities in Washington or Libyan dissidents in this country. In 1979,  eight Iranians were arrested at the Baltimore airport. Based on maps in their  possession, U.S. authorities suspected that they planned to seize the airport  and take hostages.    But all previous attempts by foreign groups have been preempted, according to  Neil C. Livingstone, adjunct professor of national security at Georgetown  University. ""They've usually been caught at the stage of buying explosives or  arms, or shortly thereafter.""    Foreign groups have launched attacks on foreign targets in the United States,  according to Rand terrorism researcher Karen Gardela. In 1973, the Palestinian  Black September group attempted to bomb El Al airlines at Kennedy Airport, an  El Al office in Queens and an Israeli branch bank in New York.    In 1980, two Iranian dissidents were assassinated in Washington and Los  Angeles, allegedly by followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.    ""In the past, international terrorists did not have to come here as they had  enough targets abroad. It may be that things are changing. We've seen  indications of this most recently in Yu Kikumura's arrest,"" Hoffman noted.    Terrorism experts said they fear that if the van bombing is proven to be a  terrorist attack, other such incidents may follow. ""Terrorists tend to be  imitative rather than innovative,"" Hoffman said. ""So in that respect, this  incident may prompt others to follow suit.""    Any strong evidence of terrorism will put the Bush Administration under serious  pressure to act, U.S. officials acknowledged. During the Reagan Administration,  Vice President Bush headed the first U.S. task force on terrorism. Its final  report vowed to ""win the war"" against terrorism with tough new measures.    The possibility of an Iranian link to the van blast was underscored by the  threats of revenge voiced openly by Iranian officials after the airliner was  shot down by the U.S. warship, which mistook it for an Iranian fighter plane.    ""The element of blood vengeance is so strong in Shiite culture that I find it  hard to believe it was anything other than an Iranian attack,"" Livingstone  said. ""There's always a symmetry to the way the Iranians operate.""    Earlier this week, FBI official Oliver B. Revell warned a Senate subcommittee  that at least 200 ""hard-core"" Iranian nationals in the United States were under  surveillance because of their loyalties to the Islamic Republic.    Of the 30,000 Iranians in this country on student visas and another 30,000 here  illegally, he said, up to 15,000 are sympathetic to the current government.  Many receive government funding or are affiliated with hard-line Iranian groups  such as the Revolutionary Guards.    He also warned: ""We cannot control our borders, even for our own  self-protection.""    Some government analysts noted that the explosive device that destroyed the van  was ""amateurish"" and therefore did not fit the pattern of sophisticated Iranian  bombings elsewhere. But others suggested that this approach fits another  pattern.    ""What we learned from the Kikumura case is that their training overseas  involves just that.

The two men were caught on Saturday in possession of almost 10kg of uranium-238 at the Arzamas-16 plant near Niznhy Novgorod. The arrests followed a joint investigation by the counter-intelligence service, the interior ministry and local security officials. Nuclear experts said that although the material was dangerous it was not of sufficient quality or quantity to make a nuclear bomb. The Russian authorities said that the arrests showed the effectiveness of current security measures and attacked the western media for tarnishing the reputation of their nuclear industry. The Russian counter-intelligence service said the country 'almost certainly' had nothing to do with the trade in contraband nuclear materials. The illicit international trade in nuclear materials was highlighted recently when three batches of weapons-grade plutonium were found in Germany. Following talks in Moscow at the weekend between Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's intelligence co-ordinator, and the Russian authorities, both countries have promised a greater exchange of intelligence information and co-operation to counter contraband plutonium. But the issue is taking on an increasingly multinational dimension. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said yesterday he would raise the matter at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers next month. He suggested the United Nations Security Council should also debate how to stop plutonium smuggling.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9111 Executive Offices.

The conclusions, reached by researchers for the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies  at UC San Diego, contradict statements by U.S. immigration authorities and  congressional representatives who assert that the law is working as designed.    The academicians, who conducted a two-year study of the effects of the 1986  law, reported that Mexican migrants are continuing to flow northward, with or  without documentation, and that 41% of those who had jobs and were interviewed  had resorted to using false or borrowed immigration documents in order to  secure work, thus circumventing the law.      Work Available, Study Says    Despite new legal sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens, the  study found that most migrants continue to find work in the United States and  that few were returning to Mexico, which is believed to account for more than  90% of the illegal immigrants entering the United States.    Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies and head of  the study, said: ""No viable alternative to migrating to the United States has  developed in these communities, so they're continuing to send people.""    Moreover, Cornelius, an expert on Mexico and immigration, said migrants were  increasingly arriving from areas of Mexico relatively new to the migrant  stream, such as Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Guerrero and Oaxaca. The  development is an ominous one for U.S. policy-makers seeking to deter illegal  immigration, Cornelius said, as it indicates that new migrant networks are  being created.    The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, the most comprehensive revision of  the nation's immigration laws in more than three decades, was designed largely  to reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants, mostly Mexicans, into the United  States via the U.S.-Mexican border.      Link to Economy    Cornelius and others have argued that the law likely would be ineffective as  long as Mexico's economy continued to deteriorate.    INS and congressional officials disputed the results of the study, asserting  that the law was indeed deterring illegal immigration. Among other things,  authorities noted that arrests of illegal aliens along the U.S.-Mexican border  -- long considered the best single indicator of undocumented immigration -- had  declined precipitously since passage of the new immigration law.    U.S. authorities have attributed the decline in arrests at the border in part  to the deterrent effect of the ""employer sanction"" sections of the new law.  Those provisions require that all employers check prospective workers'  documentation to determine that they are authorized to work in the United  States.    The decline in arrests at the border, Cornelius said, is more likely linked to  the fact that more than 3 million one-time illegal residents have been granted  legal status via the amnesty program, and are now able to cross the border  legally.

Director Pantaleon Dumlao, PNP deputy chief for operations,  said the reward hopefully would encourage reluctant witnesses to  cooperate fully with the police.    The witnesses could even request anonymity, according to PNP  Director General Umberto Rodriguez.    A senior police officer said the reward was put up because  the PNP still cannot clearly establish which group or groups  carried out the bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral in Davao City  and the subsequent explosions at three mosques.    The police announced on Wednesday the arrest of two suspects  in the cathedral attack.    Intelligence reports indicated the two suspects, Abdul Munib  and a man identified only as Jacob, belong to the Abu Sayaf, a  Muslim extremist group. This has led police to deduce the Abu  Sayaf is behind the bombing of the cathedral.    But the police official said the police are ""still looking""  for more solid evidence against Munib and Jacob. So far,  investigators are going by intelligence reports which said that  the two arrived in Davao City from Jolo via Basilan on the last  week of November along with 23 other Abu Sayaf members.    ""Even if the Abu Sayaf really is responsible for the attack  on the cathedral,"" the source said, ""there is still the matter  of solving the bombing of the mosques.""    One police official in Davao is certain both the attacks on  the cathedral and on the mosques were made by only one group.    This group, according to Senior Superintendent Teddy Carian,  police regional director, is out to sow chaos in Mindanao.    ""There exists a group that is out to create chaos between  our  Muslim brothers and Christians. Their targets are religious  structures,"" Carian said.    During the joint meeting yesterday of the Regional Peace and  Order Council and the Regional Development Council, Carian said  the bombers have only one objective: ""Open a rift and create  animosities that will open hostilities between Christians and  Muslims in Mindanao.""    Carian and Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte also denied two  Muslim  men have been arrested as suspects in the cathedral bombing.    ""So far, there are no apprehensions made. No one is under  our custody,"" Carian said.    ""We are not in a hurry. We haven't arrested a single  suspect,"" Duterte said.    It was Senior Inspector Tadgiro Ainin, the Santa Ana police  chief, who announced the arrest of Munib and Jacob, who was  positively identified by at least five witnesses.    Carian said, ""The same criminal groups which initiated these  bombings in the first place,"" and a so-called ""New Christian  Democratic Army,"" which claimed responsibility for the attack on  the three mosques, was part of this group.    ""I should not wonder if later on, there will be another  group  claiming to be anti-Christian group,"" he added.     "

The accident occurred when Russell turned in front of the truck at the  intersection of East Broadway and South Wayside Place, police said.

Speaking on Europe 1, Juppe said France had discussed with  the Chinese authorities ""our conception of human rights"" and  ""how we considered that from this point of view the situation in  China was unsatisfactory.""    Questioned about the arrests of a number of dissidents  during  the Balladur visit, Juppe said that there had been  ""disinformation"" surrounding the affair, noting that a Chinese  minister had denied the arrests while ""the New China News Agency  had confirmed them in a dispatch.""    The French minister said the aim of the trip, ""to renew  political dialogue with China,"" had been achieved.    Paris was willing to cooperate with Taiwan, said Juppe, but  added that China needed telephone lines, nuclear power stations,  high- speed trains and wheat.    ""It is with this in mind that we also renewed dialogue,""  said  Juppe.    Normal relations between Paris and Beijing were restored on  January 12 when Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms  contracts with Taiwan, healing a year-long rift.    Relations had become strained after a contract for the sale  of 60 advanced Mirage 2000-5 bombers to Taiwan, followed up by  the sale of gunboats.     "

Chief of the Second Sub-division of the Tourist Police, Pol  Col Sanit Miphan, said the three suspects are wanted by the US  government which has offered a reward of two million dollars for  information leading to their arrest.    He said the Tourist Police Division has ordered its officers  to be on the look out for the gang, who are also believed to  have shot and killed two CIA agents last year.    Pol Col Sanit Miphan said he had received a report from a  foreign source that the suspects might be in Thailand.    However, he refused to elaborate on the report because  ""police want to do their work quietly without attracting too  much attention.""    Photographs of the three terrorists have been circulated to  tourist police both in Bangkok and in such provincial areas as  Phatthaya where they might be lying low.    He identified the gang members as Mir Aimal Kansi (or Kasi),  30, a suspect in the January 25, 1993 murder of two CIA  employees in Virginia, Muhammad Faruq, 47, one of the suspects  of the February 26, 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre that  left six dead and injured 1,200.    The third suspect is Ramzi Ahmad Yousef, from Iraq or  Kuwait,  who was trained in terrorism in Pakistan.     "
0,FT942-17467 ,"FT942-17467 _AN-EDECPAAVFT 940405   FT  05 APR 94 / More arrests after Mexico assassination      By DAMIAN FRASER      MEXICO CITY   The office of Mexico's attorney-general has arrested three more people for alleged involvement in the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI). The arrests bring to five the number detained on suspicion of murder or of conspiracy to murder in the Colosio case. The attorney-general's office is also looking for two more people whom it suspects of involvement in the assassination, which took place at a campaign rally in Tijuana last month. The two have yet to be identified. An official in the investigation said the evidence definitely showed a concerted effort to kill Mr Colosio. The government will not comment on conspiracy theories, and no evidence has emerged to link the alleged killers previously arrested to organised groups. However, it has been variously suggested in the Mexican press that drug traffickers, members of the PRI or radical political groups planned the murder. The new suspects are Mr Vicente Mayoral, his son and a former state policeman, Mr Rodolfo Mayoral, and Mr Rodolfo Rivapalacio, a PRI official who helped to organise security for Mr Colosio when the candidate was in Tijuana, and who employed some of the suspects to control crowds. The police had already arrested Mr Mario Aburto, a 23-year-old mechanic, for the murder of Mr Colosio, and Mr Tranquilino Sanchez, for abetting the assassination. Mr Aburto, who has been identified by witnesses as the man who fired the fatal shots, has confessed to the crime. Mr Sanchez, like Mr Vicente Mayoral, had been employed by Mr Rivapalacio to control crowds at the rally in Tijuana. The new arrests are largely based on video and photographic evidence, which appear to show some of the suspects helping the presumed assassin gain access to Mr Colosio, and others blocking the path of the candidate and his bodyguards. The video-tape also shows some of the suspects talking with the alleged assassin before the murder. Mr Jose Cordoba, President Carlos Salinas's powerful chief of staff, became the latest political casualty of the aftermath of the assassination when he was forced to resign last week. Mr Cordoba, seen as an unofficial vice-president of Mexico, has been appointed the country's representative at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington. The enormous power exercised by Mr Cordoba, French-born son of Spanish immigrants who became a Mexican a decade ago, was much resented by many government officials and widely attacked by the press. The attacks on him threatened to hurt the campaign and image of his close friend and ally, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the PRI's new presidential candidate. Reports suggested that party officials had demanded Mr Cordoba's resignation as the price for supporting Mr Zedillo. His presence is likely to be missed by Mr Salinas for Mr Cordoba has been crucial in formulating economic policy and political strategy over the past six years, and he was a proponent of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Although hundreds of protesters with Operation Rescue effectively closed two  clinics on Pico Boulevard in February, police made no arrests, and City Council  members on Wednesday blasted LAPD Cmdr. John White for what they perceived as a  double standard in enforcing trespassing laws.      Molina Complaint    ""We're talking about different standards here,"" said Councilwoman Gloria  Molina.    ""Whether it's Mexican day workers or abortion protesters, there cannot be any  difference"" in enforcing trespassing laws, said Molina. She referred to police  arrests of day workers after complaints from area businesses.    As another example, when downtown business operators complained about homeless  people blocking entrances to their stores, ""the police came in and took care of  it,"" said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky.    Still, White told the council that there would be no automatic arrests of  protesters blocking entrances to women's clinics and harassing patients.    At last month's protest, one patient was injured as she attempted to get  through the crowd. Nationwide, more than 7,000 Operation Rescue protesters have  been arrested at demonstrations similar to those in Los Angeles.    Operation Rescue officials have vowed to descend on Los Angeles area family  planning clinics March 22 through 25.    Last week, U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter granted an American Civil  Liberties Union request for a temporary restraining order to keep protesters  from blocking entrances and demonstrating closer than 15 feet from clinic  entrances and exits. Because the protesters have ignored similar orders in  demonstrations in several other cities, ACLU attorney Carol Soble said when  Hatter issued his order that its effectiveness would depend on police  enforcement.      Ready for Trouble    White assured the council the police will be ready for trouble. ""The Emergency  Operations Center will be activated,"" he said. ""Metropolitan Division will have  four platoons (160 officers) on standby. We'll have our maximum uniform  deployment.""    But White also told the council that clinic operators would have to  specifically request that demonstrators be removed, or make citizens' arrests  on their own.    Under heated questioning by council members who wanted to know why the police  had not done more to defend the clinics last month, White said officials at  those clinics did not request assistance. But Planned Parenthood officials said  police discouraged clinic operators from seeking their help.    Several City Council members are demanding a meeting with Police Chief Daryl F.  Gates.    ""This issue needs to be addressed and addressed from the top,"" said  Yaroslavsky, who has been joined by Councilmen Richard Alatorre and Michael Woo  in requesting the meeting with Gates.    Although they were assured by White that the LAPD's policy is uniform, the  council voted 11-0 for a Molina motion directing the LAPD to use the same  policy in all trespassing cases.

""Metropolitan Division will have  four platoons (160 officers) on standby. We'll have our maximum uniform  deployment.""    But White also told the council that clinic operators would have to  specifically request that demonstrators be removed, or make citizens' arrests  on their own.    Under heated questioning by council members who wanted to know why the police  had not done more to defend the clinics last month, White said officials at  those clinics did not request assistance. But Planned Parenthood officials said  police discouraged clinic operators from seeking their help.    Several City Council members are demanding a meeting with Police Chief Daryl F.  Gates.    ""This issue needs to be addressed and addressed from the top,"" said  Yaroslavsky, who has been joined by Councilmen Richard Alatorre and Michael Woo  in requesting the meeting with Gates.    Although they were assured by White that the LAPD's policy is uniform, the  council voted 11-0 for a Molina motion directing the LAPD to use the same  policy in all trespassing cases.

0,FT923-10801 ,"FT923-10801 _AN-CG2BAAABFT 920728   FT  28 JUL 92 / Algiers blast linked to fundamentalists      By AP   TENSION between the Algerian government and Islamic fundamentalists continued to smolder yesterday as a home-made bomb exploded near a police station in the Algiers neighbourhood of Belcourt, AP reports. Though no one claimed responsibility for the bombing, it bore the hallmarks of a wave of attacks by fundamentalists on police and troops in retaliation for a harsh crackdown on their movement. No one was injured in the blast, which occurred in one of the capital's fundamentalist strongholds. The attack followed a bombing early on Saturday in el-Khroub, eastern Algeria, which left three people dead and several others injured. Bombs also exploded last week at a cinema in an Algiers suburb and at the capital's main post office. The Front for Socialist Forces, a democratic opposition party, said yesterday the attacks showed that the campaign to crush the fundamentalists had failed. 'Repression is incapable, by itself, of resolving a problem that is eminently political,' it said. State radio reported that 26 people were detained on Sunday on unspecified charges in Djelfa 125 miles south of Algiers, after clashes between fundamentalists and police on Friday left one person dead and two injured. The latest bombing followed the arrest of commanders of Algeria's presidential guard and special forces and eight others in connection with last month's assassination of Mohamed Boudiaf, head of the ruling High State Committee.

Drug prices have recently dropped. Latest reports say that  the price of Hashish has fallen from 200,000 to 90,000 rials per  kilo in the last two years. Meanwhile, Iran's anti-drug forces  seize tons of contraband drugs and make hundreds of drug-related  arrests each month.    To compensate for their losses resulting from low narcotics  prices, the traffickers are smuggling greater volumes and are  expanding their overseas markets despite the risk of  imprisonment and execution.    The IDCB's declaration, last Tuesday, suggested that the  best  way to eradicate drug smuggling is for Iran, Pakistan, and  Turkey to start harmonious regional and international campaigns  aimed at combating the cultivation, production, trafficking,  distribution, and consumption of illegal narcotics.    Since in this region Pakistan and Afghanistan are the main  producers of drugs, it is incumbent upon their governments to  pay more attention to this problem by confronting the smugglers  and weeding out corrupt government officials who facilitate the  cultivation and transport of illegal drugs.    Khorasan and Sistan-Baluchestan provinces, bordering with  Afghanistan and Pakistan, provide fertile grounds for drug  smugglers. Almost 70 per cent of drug arrests in Iran are made  in these two provinces.    According to informed sources, several groups in Afghanistan  are fighting over control of areas where Poppy is cultivated.  Drugs are the only source of foreign or even domestic  currencies in the area. Extreme poverty has always been the root  of many evils. Afghanistan is in dire need of international  financial help to return to cultivation of its traditional crops  and give up producing poppy. It also needs to be reminded that  if no efforts are made to arrest corrupt officials and local  leaders who supply the smugglers with contraband drugs, the  international community is prepared to take punitive measures  against it.    Pakistan and Iran also need to pursue their policy of  eradicating drug-related businesses. They must also increase  their efforts towards identifying and arresting officials who  collaborate with drug lords. Recent arrests in Khorasan are  quite promising, but the public must also be made aware, through  advertising campaigns, of the damage that narcotics can inflict  on individuals and societies.    Iran is the gateway through which drugs from Pakistan and  Afghanistan, as well as from South and West Asia, reach Western  Europe and the United States. All countries concerned should  help in this fight against narcotics. International  intelligence agencies must freely, and without attaching any  political strings, share all relevant information with Iran  enabling it to crush smuggling operations within and through its  territory.    International intelligence agencies could supply Iran with  satellite information pinpointing opium cultivated lands and  smuggling routes.    International cooperation is the only way to break down the  power of local drug lords and to once and for all put an end to  illegal farming and smuggling of narcotics.     "

OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      MOUNTAIN BROOK, Ala.      The U.S. Marshals Service on Sunday warned federal judges throughout the nation  to be on their guard in opening mail and packages after a package bomb killed  federal appeals court Judge Robert S. Vance and seriously injured his wife,  Helen.    FBI Director William S. Sessions immediately dispatched technicians from the  bureau's laboratory to assist in the investigation of Saturday's bombing at  Vance's home in this affluent Birmingham suburb.    Late Sunday, the area around Vance's white-columned, two-story brick home was  cordoned off, guarded by a single police cruiser, and a half-dozen vehicles  belonging to federal and local investigators were parked in the driveway.  Residents of the quiet neighborhood were stunned, and expressions of shock and  sympathy poured into the community.    At a news conference here, FBI officials said they and postal officials had  questioned Vance's wife, who remains hospitalized in serious but stable  condition. She ""has provided information that will be helpful,"" said Allen P.  Whitaker, FBI special agent in charge. He refused to be more specific.    FBI Special Agent Tom Moore described her as ""coherent and helpful."" He added  that she had telephoned a neighbor after the explosion, which occurred at 2:51  p.m. Saturday, and was outside the house in her van when paramedics arrived.    She had been in the house when the bomb exploded in the kitchen.    The device was far too powerful to be a letter bomb, Moore said. ""You can  deduce from the force and thrust"" that it was much larger, he said, adding that  it had seriously injured Helen Vance even though she was in another room.  Authorities believe the package bomb was delivered by the regular mail carrier,  Moore said.    Asked about security for other federal judges, Moore said: ""They have been  warned."" He would not say if any were under guard. One federal judge in  Birmingham, giving interviews to the news media, did not appear to be  accompanied by security personnel.    While there was speculation that Vance's murder may be linked to the heavy  volume of drug cases handled by the 11th judicial circuit on which he served,  an official involved in the probe termed it ""very unusual"" for an appellate  judge to be attacked because he is fairly remote from defendants, compared with  trial judges.    However, Moore said that Vance, 58, ""does handle many drug cases,"" adding that  possible retaliation against him is among other possibilities that  investigators are probing.    If Vance's killing did turn out to be drug-related, it would be particularly  ominous because of the possibility that the Colombian drug cartels' war on  judges had spread to the United States.    Vance, a moderate named to the bench in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter,  died instantly Saturday when the package, said by one source to be a ""nail  bomb,"" exploded.    The warning to judges reiterated cautionary advice the marshals have given to  jurists in the past, a marshals official said. Vance was under no special  protection by the marshals and had received no threats, he added.    In addition to the FBI, Marshals and Postal Service, the federal Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local police and sheriff's deputies are  taking part in the investigation.    Vance was only the third federal judge to be killed this century.    U.S. District Judge Richard Daronco was shot to death at his home in May, 1988,  by a former New York City police officer unhappy over the judge's dismissal of  a sex discrimination suit filed by the ex-policeman's daughter. Charles Koster,  the former officer, killed himself after shooting Daronco.    In 1979, U.S. District Judge John H. Wood Jr. was killed by a sniper outside  his San Antonio home. FBI Director Sessions, then a federal judge in Texas,  presided over the trial of Charles V. Harrelson, who was convicted of the  drug-related contract killing and is serving two life sentences.    In 1986, there was an attempt to kill Chief U.S. District Judge Paul Benson  with a pipe bomb in Fargo, N. D., but a law clerk became suspicious about the  package containing the bomb and it was successfully deactivated. The bomb  appeared similar to one that exploded two days earlier at a nearby post office,  injuring four workers.    The Benson case has not been solved.    In the Vance neighborhood, where Christmas decorations adorn huge homes and  roadside mailboxes, residents expressed outrage at the killing and praise for  Vance.    ""He was extremely well thought of,"" said Mary Dean Gray, who lives around the  corner. ""You don't hear about things like this in Mountain Brook. Maybe in New  York, Philadelphia or L.A., but not Mountain Brook.""    ""I couldn't believe it,"" said her husband, Jim Gray. Both said many here  believe the bombing was connected with drug cases the judge had handled.    Frank Lindstrom, who lives two houses away from the Vance home, called the  bombing shocking. Vance, he said, was ""just a nice guy.""    Neighborhood lots are spacious, filled with trees, giving residents privacy and  isolation. Lindstrom said he knew nothing about the bombing until he heard  sirens at about 3:30.    Vance and his wife raised show dogs, and several were said to be on the  spacious grounds surrounding his home when the bomb exploded. The judge often  was at home Saturdays, neighbors said.    In Washington, several colleagues and friends praised Vance's dedication to the  law.    ""He was very bright and very committed,"" said Charles Morgan Jr., a college  classmate who practiced law in Birmingham in the 1960s. ""I had great respect  for his skills.""    Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and Sessions, who had just returned from meetings in  Europe on counterterrorism, expressed outrage over Vance's killing in a  statement.    Thornburgh said acts such as the bombing ""are at odds with the underlying  belief of our nation and the rule of law.""    Sessions described the attack as ""an affront to the very strength of our  democratic society, our justice system.""    Vance, who served as a congressional page as a teen-ager and later became  student body president of the University of Alabama, was chairman of the  Alabama Democratic Party from 1966 to 1977.    As a loyalist of the national Democratic Party during the presidency of Lyndon  B. Johnson, Vance was often at odds with former Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace,  who sought repeatedly but unsuccessfully to purge him from the party  leadership. Vance was a moderate, while Wallace fought for segregation and  states' rights.    There was ""never a time when Bob was on the side of the basest elements of  Alabama,"" Morgan said.    May reported from Mountain Brook, and Ostrow from Washington.      Photo, U.S. Judge Robert S.

The proposed modifications are now in  the hands of Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party-Paraiba] and Jose Richa (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian  Social Democracy Party-Parana] -- the rapporteurs of the  Constitution and Justice and Economic Affairs Committees of the  Senate, respectively. The modifications are based on an  agreement approved during the Uruguay round of GATT talks held  in April. The agreement is known as TRIPS (""Trade-Related  Intellectual Property Rights"") [given in English].    Bio-technically, the TRIPS agreement does not impose any  major restrictions on obtaining patents on microorganisms, says  Jose Roberto d'Affonseca Gusmao, the National Institute of  Industrial Property (INPI) president. Article 27 of the GATT  agreement states that ""patents will be granted and their rights  will be fully enjoyable, without discrimination over the  involved technological field. Patents may not apply to plants  or animals, but they can apply to microorganisms. In the case  of plants, however, a `sui generis' system can be adopted if  there is no system of patents for plant species.""    This article does not clash with the government suggestion  to  maintain patents on microorganisms but not on plants or animals.    Compulsory licenses: Gusmao said the adjustments  proposed by the government deal with the wording of regulations.  The GATT agreement states that compulsory licenses may be  granted provided they meet domestic market needs, except in  cases of unfair competition as defined by court or  administrative authorities. The agreement adds that the  appropriate authorities may cancel compulsory licenses if the  circumstances that justified the issuance of such licenses  disappear and will probably not reappear. The INPI president  said the bill in the Senate will have to be adjusted as follows:    ""Pipeline"": Article 70 of the TRIPS agreement  provides for a ""pipeline"" system (patent protection on products  being developed and/or those yet to be sold on the Brazilian  market, until the patent in the originating country expires),  even in countries that adopt grace periods before granting the  patent. It also provides for a five-year period of exclusive  sale on such products to prevent imitation.    In case of the ""pipeline"" protection, the government  suggested a modification prepared by Deputy Roberto Freire,  which the Chamber of Deputies did not approve. The government  wants to protect patents that have already been launched abroad,  provided the products -- patented in one or more countries --  have not been sold on the Brazilian market. The text approved  by the Chamber of Deputies says that ""pipeline"" protection will  be granted only to non-patented products.    Domestic manufacture versus imports: Article 27 of the TRIPS  agreement says patents will be granted and their rights fully  enjoyable regardless of the place where the product was invented  or whether the products are imported or locally produced.  Gusmao said this article, which is not very clear, will be  submitted to the new World Trade Organization (WTC). ""Brazil  will respect the WTC decision. The government believes a bill  adjusted to the TRIPS should prevail.    The bill at the Senate conditions a patent to full and  complete production of the patented product in Brazilian  territory, in order to meet domestic market needs, with full use  of the patented process. To assure this ""compulsory local  production,"" the bill provides for the issue of compulsory  licenses to local manufacturers three years after the issue of  the patent.    Gusmao said the government believes ""importation does not  prove the use of the patent."" That is, the patent must be  exploited in Brazil, and not through imports. The government  supports the local exploitation condition, which foments  industrialization.""    Parallel importation: This is the importation of  patented products without the authorization of the patent owner.  Interfarma -- an organization of 39 foreign laboratories -- has  stated that the TRIPS agreement forbids parallel importation.  The government, however, maintains that the GATT agreement  ""says nothing"" about parallel importation. Gusmao said parallel  importation can be admitted only within a common market or a  free-trade zone with reciprocal rights. For example, it will be  authorized in Mercosur [Common Market of the South], through  regulations in the intellectual property rights code of the four  countries. Brazilian, Argentine, Uruguayan, and Paraguayan  authorities analyzed the subject last week.    In its suggested modifications, Gusmao said the government  does not consider parallel importation because it is  inconsistent with the requirement of local exploitation of the  patent.     "

THE RIFT HAS SHAKEN THE  ORGANIZATION LED BY AHMED JIBRIL, PRIME SUSPECT IN THE BOMBING OF PAN AM FLIGHT  103.      By NICK B. WILLIAMS Jr. and ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      DAMASCUS, Syria      Palestinian guerrilla leader Ahmed Jibril, a prime suspect in the 1988 bombing  of Pan American Flight 103, has been hobbled by twisting loyalties that  threaten full control of his radical organization, diplomatic and intelligence  officials say.    Reports of dissension in the top circles of Jibril's Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command have been circulating for weeks in  Syria, where the group has been based since its formation in 1968.    The trouble revolves around the group's growing reliance on Iranian sources to  fund its military operations, according to intelligence analysts in Damascus  and in Washington. Meanwhile, the organization is under close watch by its  Syrian hosts, who have been stung by association with the December, 1988,  terrorist bombing that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland,  killing 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.    Investigation into the bombing continues, and no charges have been made in the  British courts. However, a trail of evidence has been traced to known  operatives of Jibril's group. According to American officials, the Damascus  government has pledged not to tolerate any acts of terrorism by Syrian-based  guerrilla groups and to ""punish"" anyone who is accused on convincing evidence.    So far, there has been no direct Syrian move against Jibril, who is also known  as Abu Jihad, and his estimated 500 guerrillas.    ""Absolutely not,"" said a Damascus-based diplomat of reports that the  Palestinian radical has moved his base of operations from the outskirts of the  Syrian capital to Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley.    Syria has been Jibril's main sponsor since he founded his guerrilla command.  The Jaffa-born Palestinian was trained in the Syrian army and helped lead the  Syrian-backed Palestinian radical revolt against Yasser Arafat's mainline Fatah  guerrillas in Lebanon in the mid-1980s.    But intelligence sources inside Syria and abroad say that Jibril's command of  his organization has been challenged over the issue of the divided sponsorships  of Syria and Iran.    ""Syria has less hold over Jibril than at any point since his 1983 split with  Arafat,"" a top American counterterrorism official said in Washington.    Jibril has denied published reports that his guerrillas masterminded and  carried out the Pan Am bombing and that he received money from Iranian sources  who wanted retaliation for the felling of an Iranian airliner over the Persian  Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War by a U.S. missile cruiser that mistakenly  targeted the airliner as an F-14 jet.    Nevertheless, sources in Damascus and Washington said Jibril is receiving money  from Iran, although conceding it is not clear which faction in the Tehran  government, or outside it, is providing the funds.    ""He's following the Iranian agenda,"" said a Damascus-based diplomat. ""He's the  man chosen to carry out Iran's dirty tricks.""    Jibril's funding formerly came from Syria and Libya, but both countries have  cut back on bankrolling outside radicals in the last two years.    ""His leaning toward Tehran appears to be mainly linked to the financial issue,""  said an American analyst. ""(Libyan leader Moammar) Kadafi has cut back  seriously on his funding.""    Meanwhile, Jibril poses a political and public relations problem for the  government of Syrian President Hafez Assad. Commenting on Jibril's reported  absences from Damascus, a State Department official in Washington speculated  that Assad is trying to squeeze Jibril from power ""to get rid of the albatross  of Pan Am 103.""    With Syria on notice that ever-increasing military support from the Soviet  Union is no longer available, and with its own economy staggering, Assad's  government has taken a more moderate line in recent months. It has  re-established relations with Egypt and put out economic feelers to the West,  including the United States. Jibril and his radical Iranian connections are  drags on the new image.    Within the group, according to Damascus sources, the contending power is Talal  Najy, an East Bloc-educated Palestinian with administrative skills and a firm  loyalty to Syria. In late February, according to Washington reports, a split of  the executive committee was averted only when Najy was given control of the  political apparatus of the guerrilla command, leaving Jibril to handle military  operations. Syrian sources confirmed an informal division of powers.    One Western diplomat said that Najy was reported considering the diversion of  the group's resources to Iranian objectives, as opposed to basic anti-Israeli  activities, a serious policy change.    The two men, however, are keeping their differences ""under the surface,"" said a  well-informed Syrian observer. Both appeared last week at the Yarmouk refugee  camp outside Damascus to mark the anniversary of the founding of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.

By LEONARD BERNSTEIN and RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writers      SAN DIEGO      The wife of Capt. Will Rogers III, skipper of the San Diego-based guided  missile cruiser Vincennes, escaped unharmed Friday morning, moments before a  pipe bomb exploded under her van, igniting a fire that gutted her vehicle at a  busy La Jolla intersection.    Hours after the 7:40 a.m. explosion, the FBI took control of the investigation,  suspecting that the bombing might be an act of ""domestic terrorism"" linked to  the Vincennes' accidental downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the  Persian Gulf last July. The Navy and Marine Corps tightened security at every  military installation in San Diego County.    ""Certainly it raises the question whether there was a terrorist group involved  in this,"" said Gary Laturno, an FBI spokesman.    No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, a federal law enforcement  official said.    ""At this point in time, we have no motive; we have no suspect,"" said Thomas A.  Hughes, special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego. ""We do not rule out  the possibility of retribution against Capt. Rogers.""    However, a senior Defense Department official said there was ""no evidence"" of a  terrorist connection Friday, and some law enforcement officials described the  bombing as ""amateurish.""    An FBI spokesman said the Rogers' van was usually driven by Sharon Rogers, but  two highly placed law enforcement sources told The Times that Capt. Rogers  drove his wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident about an hour before  the blast.      Stopped at Light    The explosion occurred while the van was in the left-turn lane of northbound  Genesee Avenue, just south of La Jolla Village Drive and next to University  Towne Centre. A law enforcement official, who asked not to be identified, said  Sharon Rogers told investigators that she pulled up behind three or four cars  stopped at the red light, then heard two popping sounds.    The official said she believed that her van had been struck in the rear by  another car, so she got out and walked to the back of the van to look for  damage.    ""And then it all went up,"" the official said. ""That's all there was to it.  There were holes everywhere, and there was plenty of burn.""    The explosion propelled metal fragments through the roof of the white Toyota  and ignited a fire that gutted the vehicle.    One law enforcement source said several construction workers nearby reported  that, moments after the explosion, a red car quickly made a U-turn over the  traffic median on Genesee and sped from the scene, headed south. Witnesses said  there were four people in the red car.    ""It could have been a guy with a remote-control device who popped the bomb,""  the source said, ""or it could have been somebody who saw the explosion and was  trying not to get hurt.""    Sharon Rogers, 50, was on her way to her job as a fourth-grade teacher at La  Jolla Country Day School when the bomb detonated.      Others Escape Damage    Though there were other vehicles on three sides of the van, none was damaged,  witnesses said.    ""I believe she got out just as it blew,"" said Kurt Lent, a laborer who was  walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded.    Sharon Rogers was dazed, but walking under her own power, when the laborers  reached her. They took her to a pickup truck, where she told them that she was  the van's sole occupant and she asked them to call her husband. Will Rogers  arrived at the scene within minutes, and police took the couple to the San  Diego Police Department's Northern Division headquarters.    ""She looked like she'd just been rear-ended or something,"" said Charles Archer,  one of two masonry workers to reach Rogers first. ""She was surprised and  shocked, but she wasn't burned and she wasn't bleeding.""    San Diego police and FBI agents rushed to the Rogers' Sherlock Court home,  checking two other vehicles and the house with dogs trained to sniff for  explosives. Investigators used mirrors to look beneath the vehicles.      Husband Used Van    Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30  a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop. He returned, drank coffee with  his wife, and then Sharon Rogers, who usually drove the van, left in the  vehicle, investigators said.    When Sharon Rogers was interviewed, one law enforcement source said, she was  nervous and shaken, but she did not immediately connect the explosion with any  possible retaliation for her husband's role in shooting down the Iranian plane.    The official also said that the van had been parked in the driveway overnight  but that neither the Rogerses nor any neighbors reported seeing anyone near it.  He also said the Rogerses have a family watchdog.    ""The dog didn't bark, and the dog barks at everybody,"" the official said.    He also said Sharon Rogers told investigators that her family had received no  threats since the airplane was downed.    ""There were no threats, nothing,"" he said. ""That's what's funny. If you're  getting telephone calls in the middle of the night and threatening letters and  graffiti, you would worry. But here there was nothing.""    The Rogerses were being protected Friday night by the Naval Investigative  Service and other Navy personnel at an undisclosed location. ""They are not home  and we will not disclose their location,"" said Chief Petty Officer Craig  Huebler, a Navy spokesman. ""And we won't discuss it beyond that. That gets into  security, and you can understand the sensitivity to that.""    He said that no special security precautions were undertaken for Rogers, the  crew members or their families after the Vincennes returned to San Diego.    ""Why should the Vincennes crew be treated any different?"" Huebler said. ""There  was nothing to indicate a threat to the crew or to their families.""    All 360 sailors assigned to the Vincennes were alerted by the Navy after the  bombing and were urged to take whatever precautions they deemed necessary,  Huebler said.    Police and Navy officials said that Capt. Rogers and his wife telephoned their  son, Bill Rogers, at Colgate University, where he is a student. They assured  him they were safe.      Declined Comment    Late Friday the FBI declined comment on most aspects of the investigation. But  two law enforcement sources said one or two pipe bombs had been placed under  the van on the transmission.    ""If she didn't get out like that . . . well, she was very, very lucky,"" said  one source.    He said he and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs  apparently came from one or two explosive devices and that the apparatus was  connected under the van's transmission.    He noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire, which he said  has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were  planted on the vehicle, or that only a small amount of high-intensity  explosives was used.    Within hours, San Diego Fire Department officials confirmed that the blast was  caused by a pipe bomb. Archer said he found a flattened, 2-by-3-inch section of  metal pipe near the curb and turned it over to investigators.    Investigators from the FBI; the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms; the Naval Investigative Service; the San Diego Police Department; the  San Diego Fire Department and the San Diego County Sheriff's Department swarmed  over the scene, searching for evidence within a grid chalk-marked on the  pavement around the van.    Although two investigative sources said the device was planted on the  transmission, the FBI's Hughes said at a news conference that ""an explosive  device exploded in the vehicle.""    Authorities said they plan to keep the site of the bombing sealed off until at  least 4 p.m. today. The evidence will be reviewed by federal bomb and  anti-terrorist experts from the Department of Justice headquarters in  Washington.      Low Intensity    Two terrorism experts acknowledged that terrorists, like those operating in the  Middle East, commonly use higher-intensity explosives. They said they could not  rule out the possibility that the attack was ordered by Iran.    ""I would expect the Iranians to come better-equipped, but it's not unheard-of  for terrorists to use pipe bombs,"" said UC San Diego Prof. John Ruggie, a  consultant on terrorism for the federal government and the United Nations. ""One  example is the attack on U. S. servicemen in Germany."" In that attack, two  soldiers and a woman patron of a nightclub were killed and 200 people were  injured in West Berlin in 1986.    Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism specialist with the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, said  he has interviewed terrorists trained in Lebanon who said they were under  orders to use low-intensity explosives, like pipe bombs, when hitting foreign  targets.    The Vincennes, a guided-missile cruiser based in San Diego, returned from its  six-month Persian Gulf deployment in October. It remains in port with Rogers as  its skipper.    As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July 3, Iran Air  Flight 655 appeared on the U. S. warship's high-tech radar system. After the  plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels, Rogers  gave the order to fire.    That decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew. But the  aircraft that Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter was actually an Airbus  A300 with 290 people aboard. All of them were killed when the plane was knocked  out of the air by a missile launched from the Vincennes.    After the downing of the plane, Iran said it would seek retribution for the  deaths of the innocent civilians.    However, Navy spokesmen in San Diego said Friday that no threats had been made  against Rogers, the Vincennes or any of its crew members since the ship  returned to San Diego. The Vincennes and Rogers received some ""negative"" mail  last July, shortly after the plane was shot down, a spokesman said. That mail  was critical of the Vincennes' handling of the incident but did not contain  threats, the spokesman said.    Since the Vincennes returned to San Diego, Rogers has been overseeing routine  ship maintenance and training in preparation for its next deployment. The Navy  does not disclose the dates that any of its ships will be deployed, but surface  ships normally work in 18-month cycles, spending about six months at sea and  the rest of the time at or near their home ports.    Federal officials in Los Angeles said Friday that an FBI lookout report was  issued in San Diego in late December for a Syrian national allegedly linked to  the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 259 passengers and crew  members in Scotland.    A copy of the FBI document, obtained by The Times, said the Los Angeles FBI  office had received an anonymous phone call alleging that the Syrian,  identified as Farwan Abdin, was ""involved in or responsible for the Flight 103  crash in Scotland.""    The FBI added: ""Also mentioned were Navy quarters or TV station. No further  information given.""    The FBI's assessment at the time was that the call was ""shoddy"" but that  efforts should be made to locate Abdin. Officials said Friday that a serious  investigation of the call was never launched.    Terrorism experts believe the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over Scotland  may have been retribution for the Vincennes' shooting down of the Iranian  jetliner. But no organization that authorities thought capable of the act has  claimed responsibility for the Dec. 21 bombing of the Pan Am aircraft.    Investigators have said that, if retribution for the Iranian Airbus downing is  the motive, a group responsible may not feel it necessary to proclaim its role;  the retribution itself could carry the message.

By LEONARD BERNSTEIN and RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writers      SAN DIEGO      The wife of Capt. Will Rogers III, skipper of the San Diego-based guided  missile cruiser Vincennes, escaped unharmed Friday morning, moments before a  pipe bomb exploded under her van, igniting a fire that gutted her vehicle at a  busy La Jolla intersection.    Hours after the 7:40 a.m. explosion, the FBI took control of the investigation,  suspecting that the bombing might be an act of ""domestic terrorism"" linked to  the Vincennes' accidental downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the  Persian Gulf last July. The Navy and Marine Corps tightened security at every  military installation in San Diego County.    ""Certainly it raises the question whether there was a terrorist group involved  in this,"" said Gary Laturno, an FBI spokesman.    No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, a federal law enforcement  official said.    ""At this point in time, we have no motive; we have no suspect,"" said Thomas A.  Hughes, special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego. ""We do not rule out  the possibility of retribution against Capt. Rogers.""    However, a senior Defense Department official said there was ""no evidence"" of a  terrorist connection Friday, and some law enforcement officials described the  bombing as ""amateurish.""    An FBI spokesman said the Rogers' van was usually driven by Sharon Rogers, but  two highly placed law enforcement sources told The Times that Capt. Rogers  drove his wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident about an hour before  the blast.      Stopped at Light    The explosion occurred while the van was in the left-turn lane of northbound  Genesee Avenue, just south of La Jolla Village Drive and next to University  Towne Centre. A law enforcement official, who asked not to be identified, said  Sharon Rogers told investigators that she pulled up behind three or four cars  stopped at the red light, then heard two popping sounds.    The official said she believed that her van had been struck in the rear by  another car, so she got out and walked to the back of the van to look for  damage.    ""And then it all went up,"" the official said. ""That's all there was to it.  There were holes everywhere, and there was plenty of burn.""    The explosion propelled metal fragments through the roof of the white Toyota  and ignited a fire that gutted the vehicle.    One law enforcement source said several construction workers nearby reported  that, moments after the explosion, a red car quickly made a U-turn over the  traffic median on Genesee and sped from the scene, headed south. Witnesses said  there were four people in the red car.    ""It could have been a guy with a remote-control device who popped the bomb,""  the source said, ""or it could have been somebody who saw the explosion and was  trying not to get hurt.""    Sharon Rogers, 50, was on her way to her job as a fourth-grade teacher at La  Jolla Country Day School when the bomb detonated.      Others Escape Damage    Though there were other vehicles on three sides of the van, none was damaged,  witnesses said.    ""I believe she got out just as it blew,"" said Kurt Lent, a laborer who was  walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded.    Sharon Rogers was dazed, but walking under her own power, when the laborers  reached her. They took her to a pickup truck, where she told them that she was  the van's sole occupant and she asked them to call her husband. Will Rogers  arrived at the scene within minutes, and police took the couple to the San  Diego Police Department's Northern Division headquarters.    ""She looked like she'd just been rear-ended or something,"" said Charles Archer,  one of two masonry workers to reach Rogers first. ""She was surprised and  shocked, but she wasn't burned and she wasn't bleeding.""    San Diego police and FBI agents rushed to the Rogers' Sherlock Court home,  checking two other vehicles and the house with dogs trained to sniff for  explosives. Investigators used mirrors to look beneath the vehicles.      Husband Used Van    Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30  a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop.

The main target of  the attack was the crowded market, where there was an enormous  amount of destruction and many casualties, mostly women and  children.    Regrettably, the international community has not yet paid  appropriate attention to the policy of bombing peaceful  communities that the Azerbaijanis have followed since 1992,  which has given the Azerbaijani authorities free rein to  continue such operations with impunity.    By such savage operations, Azerbaijan is reiterating that it  has not foregone its policy of state terrorism against the  people of the NKR, the aim of which is to annihilate the  civilian population in gross violation of international law,  particularly the Geneva Convention. This policy is designed to  expand the conflict and undermine the recently instituted peace  initiatives.    The Armenian Republic's Supreme Council declares that the  Azerbaijani side will bear full responsibility for any such  operations. It calls on the UN secretary general, the CSCE, the  CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, the Europarliament, and the  parliaments of the world to strongly condemn these military  operations against civilians and to take effective and urgent  measures as envisaged by international law to prevent the  further bombing of communities and to end the unacceptable  behavior by the Azerbaijani Republic.

It  was more double the 245 deaths recorded in February and also the  fourth highest monthly death rate since the HRC began monitoring  politically related violence in 1990.    The HRC recorded 640 incidents of political violence,  compared with February's figure of 361. Nearly half of this  year's total of 1,529 incidents took place in March.    The death toll in Natal in March increased by 73 percent to  311 deaths compared to February. This was ""the most concerning  element of this months' figure as it is the only region in which  high levels of ongoing violence are occuring"", the report said.    The HRC recorded 4,139 deaths since the election date was  announced in July 1993 and 13,464 deaths since July 1990.    The number of injuries has increased more than three times  from 302 in February to 1,053 in March.    The 643 political arrests were made in March. This was the  highest number of arrests during the past 18 months, excluding  August 1993. The figure was inflated by the arrest of 405  prison warders taking part in an illegal gathering, the report  said.

All the suspects, except one, were arrested on arrival here,  said the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in the  statement.    Eleven out of the arrested suspects came on board Brazilian  Varig Air, seven on Ethiopian Airlines and one on Egypt Air,  said the text. All the suspects who came in on the Brazilian  airline and Egypt Air brought in cocaine while those arrested on  Ethiopian Airlines were found with heroin, said the statement.    According to the NDLEA, the arrests ""have confirmed an  earlier observation that (...) the Brazilian carrier, Varig Air  is the worst culprit in terms of bringing drug traffickers and  their wares into this country.""    The Ethiopian company was another airline ""with a bad  reputation in this country"" for the frequency of arrests  regularly made on the airline, said the text. Out of the entire  seizure, cocaine accounted for 6.6 kg and heroin 6.28 kg.    Last month, Africa's biggest drug haul was recorded in  Nigeria when a suspected `drug baron' imported into the country  248.3 kg (546 pounds) of high grade heroin. The suspect, Joe  Brown Akubueze, who bought the drugs in Thailand, is currently  standing trial on charges of drug trafficking before a special  tribunal in Lagos.

The Israeli Embassy was probably the target of the bomb  attack. The accident forced the terrorists to desert their  truck, which was eventually moved to Lumpini Police Station.    Inestimable damage and tragedy would have resulted if the  terrorists were able to carry out their mission. What prevented  the tragedy was the accident, not the ability of the officials  concerned.    Police and security officials and questioning of witnesses  indicate initially that the bombing attempt was the work of  international terrorists, possibly Arabs who seek to avenge the  Hebron massacre.    Among the observations concerning the bombing attempt are:  How did immigration officials allow these terrorists to enter  the country? Is the intelligence network sound and is its  coordination with foreign intelligence agencies efficient?    True, because Thailand is a democratic country and tourism  is  a major revenue earner, its check on arriving foreign tourists  is rather loose. But this should not mean that entries are  permitted without checks or for selfish reasons.    Another observation is: Why did officials of the Lumpini  Police Station leave the explosive-laden truck unchecked for six  days? This delay deprived others of any chance of a timely  arrest of suspects. Was there a written record of the accident?  Was there a neglect of duty?    Although the cold war has ended, disputes among nations have  continued more vigorously in some places, such as in the former  Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, and in the Middle East.  International terrorism has not ceased. The countries who have  lax security will fall prey first.     "

By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      LONDON      A bomb apparently planted by the Irish Republican Army exploded Friday in the  visitors' gallery at the London Stock Exchange, but there were no casualties  because the building had been evacuated after a telephoned warning.    It was the first such warning since the start of what appears to be a summer  bombing campaign against political and financial targets in London.    About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49 a.m., a man who said he was a member  of the IRA told a British news service that a bomb had been placed at the  exchange and was about to explode.    Police officials said that if there had been no warning Friday, the human toll  would have been very high.    ""There would have been injuries and probably fatalities among the people on the  trading floor,"" Police Cmdr. Hugh Moore said.    He said the warning, which allowed the police to evacuate about 300 employees,  did not detract from the gravity of the incident.    ""We had only half an hour to reach the scene, evacuate the building and clear  the surrounding streets,"" he said. ""If we had been a few minutes later getting  there, it would have been too late. These devices are unpredictable, and you  cannot guarantee when they'll go off.""    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she was appalled by Friday's attack but  relieved that there had been no casualties.    Damage to the exchange building was extensive, however. Cmdr. George  Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said the bomb  blew a 20-by-7-foot hole in the building's facade, destroyed most of the  visitors' gallery and littered the street outside with rubble. He said the bomb  appeared to have been placed in the visitors' gallery men's room, possibly  during the night.    The explosion had little impact on stock trading, which is carried out largely  by computer at brokerage houses elsewhere.

By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      LONDON      A bomb apparently planted by the Irish Republican Army exploded Friday in the  visitors' gallery at the London Stock Exchange, but there were no casualties  because the building had been evacuated after a telephoned warning.    It was the first such warning since the start of what appears to be a summer  bombing campaign against political and financial targets in London.    About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49 a.m., a man who said he was a member  of the IRA told a British news service that a bomb had been placed at the  exchange and was about to explode.    Police officials said that if there had been no warning Friday, the human toll  would have been very high.    ""There would have been injuries and probably fatalities among the people on the  trading floor,"" Police Cmdr. Hugh Moore said.    He said the warning, which allowed the police to evacuate about 300 employees,  did not detract from the gravity of the incident.    ""We had only half an hour to reach the scene, evacuate the building and clear  the surrounding streets,"" he said. ""If we had been a few minutes later getting  there, it would have been too late. These devices are unpredictable, and you  cannot guarantee when they'll go off.""    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she was appalled by Friday's attack but  relieved that there had been no casualties.    Damage to the exchange building was extensive, however. Cmdr. George  Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said the bomb  blew a 20-by-7-foot hole in the building's facade, destroyed most of the  visitors' gallery and littered the street outside with rubble. He said the bomb  appeared to have been placed in the visitors' gallery men's room, possibly  during the night.    The explosion had little impact on stock trading, which is carried out largely  by computer at brokerage houses elsewhere. The volume of business conducted on  the trading floor has declined to the point that the visitors' gallery is  scheduled to be closed.    Public reaction was generally light-hearted.    ""A computer crash would have hit London's financial markets far harder than  today's explosion,"" the Press Assn., Britain's domestic news agency, quoted one  broker as saying.

In a written statement issued today, Karayalcin noted that  he  finds the massacre at Tuzla train station in which five officer  cadets were martyred, the bombing of the Democracy Party  headquarters, and the killing of the Motherland Party mayor of  Adalar, as very worrying from the viewpoint of their timing as  well as their nature.    Stressing that it does not matter much if these incidents  were planned or coincidental, Karayalcin said: I described my  concern on the subject as the preparations of centers wanting to  interrupt or eliminate democracy and I called on all political  party leaders to display unity against such moves. Asked by  reporters who these centers are, I retorted: I wish I knew and  I could make it public. These attacks are directed against  democracy. I do not believe that anyone could interpret these  intensifying incidents of terror and bombing in any other way.  I continue to hold these views. In voicing my concern,  however, I never used the word coup. I never linked the  incidents to the army. Moreover, if I had any information on  the subject, I would not have hesitated to make it public in  line with my understanding of democracy.    Karayalcin remarked that democracy is the only foundation  for  the solution of all problems and called on all parties to  embrace one another and democracy.     "

While Kooijmans met with Prime Minister Li Peng and his  counterpart Qian Qichen, the confrontation between Beijing and  Washington over human rights escalated. Yesterday student  leader Wang Dan was arrested for the second time in a week for  further questioning.    Kooijmans's U.S. counterpart, Warren Christopher, who is in  Australia and will arrive in Beijing on Friday, said that the  dozens of arrests last weekend ""could have a negative impact"" on  his visit and on the assessment of Beijing's human rights  policies. President Clinton wants to first see a significant  improvement in human rights before extending China's  most-favored nation trading status another year.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry has accused Clinton of  ""irresponsible interference in China's internal affairs."" A few  days ago Clinton criticized the arrests in Beijing and Shanghai.  Kooijmans received a similar reaction when he questioned Li and  Qian about the recent arrests.    The Netherlands is avoiding a confrontation to be able to  exercise maximum pressure on Beijing, a civil servant in the  Netherlands delegation said. Nevertheless, Kooijmans spoke of  ""difficult discussions."" ""The Chinese leadership still has very  little sympathy for human rights,"" he said. ""They see foreign  concern in the context of an ideological controversy and believe  that human rights are being used as a political weapon.""    Kooijmans said that the Netherlands Government's room for  maneuver should not be compared with that of the U.S.  Government. The U.S. approach ""is felt here to be particularly  offensive. This emerged clearly from the reactions,"" he said.  ""We have our own approach. I find it important each time to  inspire confidence by not using human rights as a political  weapon. To show that concern about human rights is real and not  something which you raise for other motives.""    The minister said he had ""no reason at all"" to think that  his  contribution was leading to any change in China's policies.  ""But I have been active in human rights long enough to know  that you should never expect results overnight, that it is a  very gradual process,"" he said.    In addition to the arrests of the dissidents, Kooijmans  discussed with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier Li Peng  the Tibet question and China's harder approach to religious  activities. Kooijmans said that in the last year little progress  had been made in China's contacts with the dalai lama, the  exiled Tibetan god-king, or with his representatives.    As for the religious decrees announced last month, the  Chinese Government gave the impression that they were intended  to protect the religious freedom of the recognized religious  communities or to oppose Islamic fundamentalism, Kooijimans said.    Kooijmans said he had the impression that the decrees were  also directed against a number of Christian communities. He  expressed his displeasure about this and advised the Chinese to  contact the World Council of Churches and the Vatican.    Kooijmans also gave his Chinese hosts a new list of names of  people about whom the Netherlands Government is asking for  information. Most of the people mentioned are in prison after  being sentenced in court. A number of them are in  ""administrative detention,"" which comes down to being held for  three to four years without trial.     "

SERRANO, Times Staff Writers      SAN DIEGO      The wife of Capt. Will Rogers III, skipper of the San Diego-based Vincennes,  escaped unharmed Friday morning moments before a pipe bomb exploded under her  van, igniting a fire that gutted her vehicle at a busy La Jolla intersection.    Hours after the 7:40 a.m. explosion, the FBI took control of the investigation,  suspecting that the bombing might be an act of ""domestic terrorism"" linked to  the Vincennes' accidental downing of an Iranian civilian airliner in the  Persian Gulf last July, killing 290. The Navy and Marine Corps tightened  security at every military installation in San Diego County.    ""Certainly it raises the question whether there was a terrorist group involved  in this,"" said Gary Laturno, an FBI spokesman.      No Motive Yet    No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, a federal law enforcement  official said.    ""At this point in time, we have no motive; we have no suspect,"" said Thomas A.  Hughes, special agent in charge of the FBI in San Diego. ""We do not rule out  the possibility of retribution against Capt. Rogers.""    However, a senior Defense Department official said that there was ""no evidence""  of a terrorist connection Friday, and some law enforcement officials described  the bombing as ""amateurish.""    Nonetheless, federal officials acknowledged that the incident followed an FBI  lookout report issued in San Diego in late December for a Syrian national  allegedly linked to the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 259  passengers and crew members in Scotland last year.    A copy of the FBI document, obtained by The Times, said the Los Angeles FBI  office had received an anonymous phone call alleging that the Syrian,  identified as Farwan Abdin, was ""involved in or responsible for the Flight 103  bombing over Scotland.""    The FBI added: ""Also mentioned were Navy quarters or TV station. No further  information given.""    The FBI's assessment at the time was that the call was ""shoddy"" but that  efforts should be made to locate Abdin. Officials said Friday that a serious  investigation of the call was never launched.    The Rogerses were being protected Friday night by the Naval Investigative  Service and other Navy personnel at an undisclosed location.    ""They are not home, and we will not disclose their location,"" said Chief Craig  Huebler, a Navy spokesman. ""And we won't discuss it beyond that. That gets into  security, and you can understand the sensitivity to that.""    He said that no special security precautions had been undertaken for Rogers,  crew members and their families after the Vincennes returned to San Diego.    ""Why should the Vincennes crew be treated any different?"" he said. ""There was  nothing to indicate a threat to the crew or to their families.""    All 360 sailors assigned to the Vincennes were alerted by their commanders  Friday morning of the bomb in the Rogerses' van and urged to take whatever  precautions they deemed necessary, Huebler said.    Police and Navy officials said Rogers and his wife telephoned their son, Bill  Rogers, at an eastern university, where he is a student. They assured him that  they were safe.    After the bombing Friday, an FBI spokesman said the Rogerses' van was usually  driven by Sharon Rogers, but two highly placed law enforcement sources told The  Times that Will Rogers drove his wife's van to a doughnut shop without incident  about an hour before the blast.    The explosion occurred while the van was in the left-turn lane on Genesee  Avenue, south of La Jolla Village Drive. A law enforcement official, who asked  not to be identified, said Sharon Rogers told investigators that she pulled up  behind three or four cars stopped at a red light at the intersection and then  suddenly heard two popping sounds.    The official said she believed that her van had been struck in the rear by  another car, so she got out and walked to the back of the van to look for  damage.    ""And then it all went up,"" the official said. ""That's all there was to it.  There were holes everywhere, and there was plenty of burn.""    The explosion propelled metal fragments through the roof of the white Toyota  and ignited a fire that destroyed the vehicle.    One law enforcement source said several construction workers nearby reported  that moments after the explosion, a red car quickly made a U-turn over the  traffic median on Genesee and sped from the scene. No other description of the  car was available, but witnesses said there were four people in it.    ""It could have been a guy with a remote-control device who popped the bomb,"" he  said, ""or it could have been somebody who saw the explosion and was trying not  to get hurt.""    Sharon Rogers, 50, was on her way to her job as a fourth-grade teacher at La  Jolla Country Day School when the bomb went off.      Other Vehicles Undamaged    Though the van was surrounded on three sides by other vehicles, none of them  were damaged, witnesses said.    ""I believe she got out just as it blew,"" said Kurt Lent, a laborer who was  walking down a dirt embankment toward the vehicle as it exploded.    Sharon Rogers was dazed but walking under her own power, when the laborers  reached her. They took her to a pickup truck, where she told them that she was  the van's sole occupant and asked them to call her husband. Will Rogers arrived  at the scene within a few minutes, and police took the couple to the San Diego  Police Department's Northern Division headquarters.    ""She looked like she'd just been rear-ended or something,"" said Charles Archer,  one of two masonry workers to reach Rogers first. ""She was surprised and  shocked, but she wasn't burned and she wasn't bleeding.""    San Diego police and FBI agents rushed to the Rogerses' home on Sherlock Court,  checking two other vehicles and the home with dogs specially trained to sniff  for explosives. Investigators also used mirrors to look beneath the vehicles.    Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30  a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop. He returned, drank coffee with  his wife, and then Sharon Rogers, who usually drove the van, left in the  vehicle, investigators said.    When Sharon Rogers was interviewed, one law enforcement source said, she was  nervous and shaken, but she did not immediately connect the explosion with any  possible retaliation for her husband's role in shooting down the Iranian  jetliner.    The official also said that the van had been parked in the driveway overnight,  but that neither the Rogerses nor any neighbors reported prowlers near the  vehicle. He also said the Rogerses have a family watchdog.    ""The dog didn't bark, and the dog barks at everybody,"" the official said.    He also said Sharon Rogers told investigators that her family had received no  threats since the airplane was downed.    ""There were no threats, nothing,"" he said. ""That's what's funny. If you're  getting telephone calls in the middle of the night and threatening letters and  graffiti, you would worry. But here there was nothing.""    Late Friday, the FBI declined comment on most aspects of the investigation, but  at a press conference, the FBI's Hughes said, ""An explosive device exploded in  the vehicle.""    However, two law enforcement sources said one or two pipe bombs had been placed  on the transmission under the van.    ""If she didn't get out like that . . . well, she was very, very lucky,"" one  source said.    He said he and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs  apparently came from one or two explosive devices, and that the apparatus was  connected under the van's transmission.    He noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire, which he said  has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were  planted on the vehicle or that only a small amount of high-intensity explosives  were used.    Within hours, San Diego Fire Department officials confirmed that the blast was  caused by a pipe bomb. Archer said he found a flattened, 2-by-3-inch section of  metal pipe near the curb and turned it over to investigators.    The Vincennes, a guided-missile cruiser based in San Diego, returned from its  six-month Persian Gulf deployment last October. It remains in port with Rogers  as its skipper.    As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July 3, Iran Air  Flight 655 appeared on the U.S. warship's high-tech radar system. After the  plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels, Rogers  gave the order to fire.    That decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew. But the  aircraft that Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter was actually an Airbus  A300. All aboard were killed when the plane was knocked out of the air by a  Vincennes missile.    After the downing of the plane, Iran said it would seek retribution for the  deaths of the innocent civilians.      No Threats    However, Navy spokesmen in San Diego said Friday that no threats had been made  against Rogers, the Vincennes or any of its crew members since the ship  returned to San Diego. The Vincennes and Rogers received some ""negative"" mail  last July, shortly after the Iranian plane was shot down, a spokesman said. The  mail was critical of the Vincennes' handling of the incident but did not  contain threats, the spokesman said.    Since the Vincennes returned to San Diego, Rogers has been overseeing routine  ship maintenance and training in preparation for its next deployment. The Navy  does not disclose the dates any of its ships will be deployed, but surface  ships normally work in 18-month cycles, spending about six months at sea and  the remainder of the time at or near their home ports.    Terrorism experts believe that the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 may have  been retribution for the Vincennes' shooting down of the Iranian jetliner. But  no organization that authorities thought capable of the act has claimed  responsibility for the bombing of the Pan Am aircraft.

San Diego police and FBI agents rushed to the Rogerses' home on Sherlock Court,  checking two other vehicles and the home with dogs specially trained to sniff  for explosives. Investigators also used mirrors to look beneath the vehicles.    Two law enforcement sources said Will Rogers left the couple's home about 6:30  a.m. and drove in the van to a doughnut shop. He returned, drank coffee with  his wife, and then Sharon Rogers, who usually drove the van, left in the  vehicle, investigators said.    When Sharon Rogers was interviewed, one law enforcement source said, she was  nervous and shaken, but she did not immediately connect the explosion with any  possible retaliation for her husband's role in shooting down the Iranian  jetliner.    The official also said that the van had been parked in the driveway overnight,  but that neither the Rogerses nor any neighbors reported prowlers near the  vehicle. He also said the Rogerses have a family watchdog.    ""The dog didn't bark, and the dog barks at everybody,"" the official said.    He also said Sharon Rogers told investigators that her family had received no  threats since the airplane was downed.    ""There were no threats, nothing,"" he said. ""That's what's funny. If you're  getting telephone calls in the middle of the night and threatening letters and  graffiti, you would worry. But here there was nothing.""    Late Friday, the FBI declined comment on most aspects of the investigation, but  at a press conference, the FBI's Hughes said, ""An explosive device exploded in  the vehicle.""    However, two law enforcement sources said one or two pipe bombs had been placed  on the transmission under the van.    ""If she didn't get out like that . . . well, she was very, very lucky,"" one  source said.    He said he and other investigators determined that the two initial loud bangs  apparently came from one or two explosive devices, and that the apparatus was  connected under the van's transmission.    He noted that most of the van's damage resulted from the fire, which he said  has led investigators to believe that either low-intensity explosives were  planted on the vehicle or that only a small amount of high-intensity explosives  were used.    Within hours, San Diego Fire Department officials confirmed that the blast was  caused by a pipe bomb. Archer said he found a flattened, 2-by-3-inch section of  metal pipe near the curb and turned it over to investigators.    The Vincennes, a guided-missile cruiser based in San Diego, returned from its  six-month Persian Gulf deployment last October. It remains in port with Rogers  as its skipper.    As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July 3, Iran Air  Flight 655 appeared on the U.S. warship's high-tech radar system. After the  plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels, Rogers  gave the order to fire.    That decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew. But the  aircraft that Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter was actually an Airbus  A300. All aboard were killed when the plane was knocked out of the air by a  Vincennes missile.    After the downing of the plane, Iran said it would seek retribution for the  deaths of the innocent civilians.      No Threats    However, Navy spokesmen in San Diego said Friday that no threats had been made  against Rogers, the Vincennes or any of its crew members since the ship  returned to San Diego. The Vincennes and Rogers received some ""negative"" mail  last July, shortly after the Iranian plane was shot down, a spokesman said. The  mail was critical of the Vincennes' handling of the incident but did not  contain threats, the spokesman said.    Since the Vincennes returned to San Diego, Rogers has been overseeing routine  ship maintenance and training in preparation for its next deployment. The Navy  does not disclose the dates any of its ships will be deployed, but surface  ships normally work in 18-month cycles, spending about six months at sea and  the remainder of the time at or near their home ports.    Terrorism experts believe that the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 may have  been retribution for the Vincennes' shooting down of the Iranian jetliner. But  no organization that authorities thought capable of the act has claimed  responsibility for the bombing of the Pan Am aircraft.

0,FT933-6116 ,"FT933-6116 _AN-DH4CVABUFT 930831   FT  31 AUG 93 / City security tighter after bomb find      By MICHAEL SMITH   POLICE are likely to be more vigilant in checking people entering the City of London today following an attempted bombing in Bishopsgate on Saturday. Terrorists breached the security ring and planted what police called a 'small device' behind a hoarding in Wormwood Street. Police were alerted to the attempted bombing by a call from a man with an Irish accent who used a recognised code word. The bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion. There were no injuries. The latest attempt follows the setting up last month of checkpoints around the City, and the blocking of many entrances to it, in response to previous terrorist explosions. The alert will intensify a debate over the effectiveness of the measures which are considered too disruptive by some critics and as a propaganda coup for the IRA by others. Saturday's explosion came just 48 hours after a warning from Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, that the area was still at risk from hand-carried bombs. 'Clearly it would be rash to claim that we have 100 per cent security, but I do know that we have reduced drastically the risk of another large vehicle-borne bomb getting into the financial heart of the City,' Mr Kelly said. He added: 'Hand-carried bombs may in the future be planted in the zone and the less well-informed will claim that our arrangements have failed. 'Of course we have never claimed that we could ever detect or prevent any one of the hundreds of thousands of people who come into the City daily, most of whom carry bags or cases of some sort, from bringing in a bomb.'

Thai police received information from Washington that Mir  Aimal Kansi, 30, slipped into Thailand in mid-December to hide  in the network of guerrilla and criminal gangs operating here,  according to the source, a senior member of the special branch  who spoke on condition of anonymity.    Kansi was suspected of killing two employees of the Central  Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Virginia on January 25, 1993.    He was also suspected of operating in the same gang as  Muhammad Farooq and Ramzi Ahmad Yousef, suspects in the Febuary  26, 1993 bombing of New York's World Trade Center.    Although Thai police have not received information on  Farooq's or Yousef's whereabouts, they have circulated wanted  posters for all three men in Thai tourist resorts. The posters  offer a US$2 million reward in exchange for information leading  to their arrest.    The source said Thai police had sent three teams to search  for Kansi in the tourist resorts of Pattaya, Phuket and Hat Yai,  one to northern Thailand and two to the Muslim-dominated  provinces of Pattani and Narathiwat.    ""But so far there is no clue leading to the suspect,"" he  said. ""We believe he has had cosmetic surgery done to his face,  is carrying false travelling documents and is associating with  international gangsters.""

NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that ""the West asked Russia to do  its utmost for enabling NATO not to put its ultimatum into  effect... After adopting the ultimatum, which was prompted by  emotions and not careful calculations, and after realising how  dangerous its consequences may be, the NATO countries began  themselves to persuade Russia to do all it can for preventing  the bombing.""    ""Boris Yeltsin and Russian diplomats have managed to ward  off  the threat of the bombing of the positions of Bosnian Serbs. By  all appearances, the Russian diplomacy is set to develop the  initial success,"" the newspaper points out. This means that the  Moslems are expected to respond to the Russian initiative in the  same way as Serbs. The Russian diplomacy believes that its next  task is to achieve the demilitarisation of Sarajevo, following  the diplomatic breakthrough, and its putting under U.N. control,  as is envisaged by all the settlement plans. ""This should be  followed by the settlement of local Bosnian problems, along with  keeping in sight a global settlement of the crisis.""    According to ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, ""the plan of the settlement  of the conflict, suggested by Boris Yeltsin, makes the bombing  senseless ... However, it is too early to celebrate a victory.  A successful settlement of the crisis, brought about by a mine  explosion at the Sarajevo market place and the death of 68  people, is just the first stage in establishing comprehensive  peace in the Balkan Peninsula. Many more joint actions will be  required from all countries of the world community before the  fratricidal war, which has been going on for 22 months, will be  ended with a peace settlement.""    Analysing the Russian peace initiative and its possible  impact on the normalisation of the situation in Bosnia,  IZVESTIYA writes that ""the Russian diplomacy is saving NATO from  the need to resort to force in Bosnia"" and is giving a chance to  Serbs. ""This breakthrough of the Russian diplomacy is a logical  and natural continuation of its Balkan policy, which has done  far more good than actions and statements of any other Russian  institution, party or group. Servicemen from various countries,  who are now in Bosnia as part of the U.N. peace-keeping force,  know well that not a single agreement has been fulfilled there  so far, not a single ceasefire accord has lasted long. The  situation with the latest agreement will become clear on Monday,  the day when the NATO ultimatum expires. Even if the situation  changes for the better, the settlement of the crisis around  Sarajevo is an important, but initial step towards stopping the  war and finding a political settlement in Bosnia and  Herzegovina.""    According to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, ""Russia's stand is clear: to  prevent NATO air strikes at Bosnian Serbs."" In the opinion of  the author of the article, which is frontpaged by the newspaper  today, ""whatever they say in the West about the fear that Serbs  felt after the NATO ultimatum, it is confidence that played a  decisive role in the fulfilment of its terms by Serbs, the  confidence that they feel for Russia and its servicemen."" The  article points out, at the same time, that if the U.N. plan of  the troop withdrawal and the taking of Sarajevo under U.N.  control is put into effect, this first major victory over the  Bosnian nightmare will go to the credit both of the U.N., NATO  and the Russian diplomacy.""

The bomb exploded at lunchtime in a pub in the Covent Garden area. It was the eighth to explode in the capital over the past week. It followed a warning nine minutes before the blast to a radio station that police described as 'deliberately vague and confusing'. The warning used a recognised IRA codeword and said the bomb had been placed in the 'Leicester Square area', leaving officers with little time to clear surrounding buildings. Although the recent attacks have involved relatively small devices and caused few casualties, they have been marked by a constant shift in tactics aimed at stretching police resources while giving maximum publicity to the IRA. The bombing campaign coincides with cross-party talks on Northern Ireland's future involving nationalist and Unionist leaders, but excluding Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. Yesterday's bomb was a grim reminder of the pub bombings of the 1970s in Guildford and Birmingham. On Saturday a bomb exploded in a telephone box near the high-security Paddington Green police station, west London, where IRA terrorist suspects are held. It was followed by an IRA statement warning: 'British military and political leaders should take this signal of our intentions seriously.' Last week there were also car-bomb explosions, other minor devices, and a series of hoaxes. An RUC officer was slightly injured late last night when a bomb was thrown at a security patrol in north Belfast.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

The officers supervised clearance of the Coliseum  after the concert ended and made several arrests in connection with the  stabbings. One of the victims was in extremely critical condition, officers  said. Police also received reports of several incidents of gunshots fired on  streets adjacent to the Coliseum.

0,FT932-2874 ,"FT932-2874 _AN-DFQCFAAYFT 930617   FT  17 JUN 93 / Mexico fires agents in drugs purge      By LUCY CONGER      MEXICO CITY   MEXICO has sacked 67 members of the federal anti-drugs squad, including 13 commanders, in a crackdown on collusion with traffickers. They will be arrested if investigations show proof of criminal activity, the attorney general's office said yesterday. A further 75 agents based in the state of Sinaloa, an important centre of trafficking, are reported to have been transferred to Mexico City for interrogation about links with the illegal drugs trade. The authorities have also detained for questioning Mr Rodrigo Esparza Cristerna, the attorney general's representative in the state, suggesting that investigations may reach beyond the security forces. President Carlos Salinas's administration has stepped up its campaign against drug trafficking in the wake of a shoot-out last month between rival gangs at Guadalajara airport when seven people were killed, including a Roman Catholic cardinal. The incident shocked Mexican society and brought home the ease with which cocaine rings operate in the country. Since then, a string of arrests has been made in an attempt to curb the Sinaloa cocaine cartel, culminating in the detention on June 8 in Guatemala of Mr Joaquin Guzman Loera, its alleged head. However, even these successes have proved controversial. Questions have been asked why all the initial arrests related to the airport shootings have been of Sinaloa cartel members, while no members of its Tijuana rival have been detained. Churchmen have also voiced doubts about the official theory that the cardinal, shot at point-blank range, was mistaken for a trafficker. There is some scepticism about the extent and durability of the drugs crackdown. The operation against Mr Guzman 'fits with the Salinas strategy of spectacular strikes that don't ultimately change the balance of power,' said Ms Denise Dresser, political scientist at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.

By PAUL LIEBERMAN and JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      The problem drugs were heroin and powder cocaine in January, 1984, when the New  York Police Department tried a new tactic in an area of Manhattan's Lower East  Side that was considered the city's worst narcotics ""supermarket.""    In what was dubbed ""Operation Pressure Point,"" a four-block by eight-block area  was saturated with more than 200 officers, some working undercover but most  still in uniform -- enough to station an officer at virtually every corner.  ""They made car stops, strictly enforced traffic laws and conducted 'stop and  frisks' where appropriate,"" Sgt. Peter Sweeney said.    And they stayed for eight months.    The New York crackdown is the closest thing to a precedent for a law  enforcement campaign begun Thursday in Los Angeles, the ""Neighborhood Rescue  Operation"" in which police took the extra step of erecting barricades at  entrances to a square-mile area near MacArthur Park. Police Chief Daryl F.  Gates said 60 officers would patrol the area indefinitely.    Looking back at Operation Pressure Point, New York police view it as a  long-term success on the Lower East Side, but of far lesser value in other  neighborhoods where it was later tried. The key factor in long-term success,  they said, went beyond police work -- it was the ability of a community to  transform itself.    In the Lower East Side, Inspector Alfred James recalled, ""the area was ripe for  gentrification. There was a lot of money to rebuild.""    A year after the police influx began, business rents had doubled, artists had  discovered the area and real estate brokers were interested in once worthless  properties -- a dilapidated 16-story building formerly used as a ""shooting  gallery"" by addicts sold for $3.5 million.    But police hardly pretended that they had eliminated drug dealing. Although  there were more than 2,000 arrests the first month of Operation Pressure Point,  many dealers had simply moved elsewhere, gone indoors or developed new tactics  to avoid detection. Police did claim more success, through arrests and car  seizures, in deterring suburbanites from driving to the area to buy drugs -- a  problem Los Angeles officials say is severe near MacArthur Park.    ""People would drive in from Queens, (New) Jersey,"" James said. ""We gave out a  message to those people.""    But the conditions were different, he said, in an area of Harlem where  Operation Pressure Point II was conducted from March, 1984, through April 1985.    ""We made 12,000 arrests up there, but we didn't have the same impact,"" James  said, explaining that the drug buyers tended to be local and could walk two  blocks outside the police zone to find their drugs. In addition, there was no  gentrification to displace the ""bad elements"" once the massive police presence  ended.    In New York, the strategy of flooding an area with uniformed officers ended  when the nature of the drug problem changed in 1986 with the arrival of  low-priced ""crack"" cocaine.    Police decided to put their drug-fighting resources instead into ""T.N.T.,""  Tactical Narcotics Teams, which are essentially undercover operations to make  buys from, and arrest, pushers in selected violence-plagued neighborhoods.    Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Allatore said officials here are under no  illusion that police saturation can do much more than give a hard-hit community  temporary relief.

It is also waiting  for Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' meeting with Albanian  Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi on 3 May in Zurich.

Venizelos added: This  [Orthodox] Easter [1 May], the Albanian authorities must prove  that they respect freedom of religion.    The Greek Government will proceed to reduce the staff of the  Albanian Embassy in Athens, because Albanian President Sali  Berisha's government has not reconsidered their decision to  reduce the staff of the Greek Embassy in Tirana. We remind you  that the staff of the Greek Embassy in the Albanian capital has  been reduced by 30 percent.    A short time ago, REUTER NEWS AGENCY reported from Athens  that an Albanian diplomat had been informed that he must leave  the country by tomorrow.

In Cairo, home of the Arab League, officials were describing the resolution as hasty and ill-conceived, and they doubted it would force Libya to yield the two men suspected of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Scotland. The league called on the international community to intensify the search for compromise 'in order to avoid the dangerous consequences of this resolution.' League officials said they would continue working behind the scenes in an effort to defuse the crisis, but they were not optimistic. Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organisation derided Security Council resolution 748 as another example of 'double standards', comparing it unfavourably with the west's perceived failure to exert similar pressure on Israel to vacate Arab land. The sanctions oblige all UN member states to bar flights to or from Libya, prohibit arms deals with the North African state and significantly reduce the staff of Libyan missions. Libya has been given until April 15 to yield the two men accused of the airliner bombing in which 270 died. It is also being asked to hand over four of its nationals to France for questioning in connection with the 1989 downing of a French UTA airliner over Niger in which all 171 passengers and crew perished. A Libyan foreign ministry statement accused the US, Britain and France of conducting a 'crusader war against Arabs and Moslems' by depriving them of their weapons. The UN will send a senior envoy to Libya tomorrow to discuss the Lockerbie dispute, Reuter reports from Cairo. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, informed the Arab League of the mission.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

YBARRA, Times Staff Writer      WASHINGTON      Pan American World Airways has been fined $630,000 for security violations  discovered in the course of an investigation spurred by the terrorist bombing  of Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, officials announced Wednesday.    In the aftermath of the Dec. 21 disaster, the Federal Aviation Administration  found lapses in Pan Am's passenger and baggage screening at Frankfurt and  London, where the New York-bound flight originated and stopped.

0,FT941-3269 ,"FT941-3269 _AN-ECQDGAANFT 940317   FT  17 MAR 94 / Journalist questioned on Berlusconi scandal leak      By ROBERT GRAHAM      ROME   Fresh controversy has blown up over illicit payments on football player transfers allegedly made by the Fininvest group, owned by Italy's aspiring politician Mr Silvio Berlusconi. The row has been simmering since last Wednesday when Tv5, one of Fininvest's three national television channels, announced that Milan magistrates had sought authorisation to arrest six senior Fininvest executives. The arrests were allegedly connected to the payment of undeclared sums on the transfer to cup-winning AC Milan of Turin's prize player 'Gigi' Lentini in 1992. Milan magistrates immediately claimed the news had been deliberately leaked and took possession of a copy of the Tv5 video of the announcement. They suspected the news was made public to avoid high profile arrests of persons linked to Mr Berlusconi at a sensitive moment in the campaign for the March 27 general elections. Yesterday, the magistrates interrogated a Tv5 journalist about the leak, a day after a Milan judge declined a request for the arrest of the six Fininvest officials. It was later announced that the journalist was formally under investigation for aiding and abetting. The officials included Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, the head of Publitalia, the advertising arm of Fininvest, and the organisational core around which Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia political movement has been built. Mr Dell'Utri is part of Mr Berlusconi's inner circle and is widely credited with having helped persuade Mr Berlusconi to enter the political ring. Mr Berlusconi himself has claimed he and Fininvest are being persecuted by the Milan magistrates in a political vendetta. However, yesterday the magistrates let it be known they were continuing their investigations into the transfer operations of AC Milan. A former head of Turin football club has alleged that at least L6bn (Pounds 2.43m) was paid through foreign banks to secure the Lentini transfer  - on top of the sum officially declared.

Major Rob Thomas, Canadian head of UN military observers,  said house arrests took place in Serb-controlled zones in Bosnia.    Police and Serb soldiers stood guard outside some of the  observers' homes, Thomas said, while other observers had been  threatened with arrest if they left their places of residence.    The house arrests were one of the responses by Bosnian Serb  forces to NATO airstrikes Sunday and Monday on Serb positions  around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia.    Another UN military observer and his interpreter were  missing  on Monday in Serb territory after they left Zepa, a Moslem  enclave north of Gorazde.    Elsewhere, General Michael Rose, UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) commander in Bosnia, said Tuesday he was ""worried""  about peacekeeping forces trapped by Serb mines in several areas  of Bosnia.    Talks were continuing Tuesday to free a convoy of Swedish  peacekeeping troops blocked since Sunday at a Serb checkpoint in  Kobiljaca, northwest of Sarajevo, French journalists said.    Serb troops planted mines around the convoy of six vehicles  and 16 men after the first NATO airstrike on Sunday. The  original reason for the blockade was said to be ""administrative.""    More peacekeeping troops were also trapped and surrounded by  mines in at least three Serb heavy arms centres in the exclusion  zone around Sarajevo, a UNPROFOR spokesman said.    Rose told reporters at a press conference: ""They (the  troops)  are not under any direct threat at the moment."" He said he was  ""worried"" by the situtation but did not want to increase  tension.

The delegations  included representatives of the Public Order and Foreign Affairs  Ministries of the two countries. Correspondents report that the  meeting dealt with events at the Ano Episkopi Military Camp and  the issue of the Albanian illegal immigrants, whose number at  the Greek-Albanian border has increased.    Yeoryios Kirousis, our correspondent in Ioannina, reports  that most of the arrested North Epirus Greek-Albanians, members  of the organization Omonoia [Greek-Albanians Association], have  been taken to Tirana. No one knows how many Omonoia members  have been arrested from Sarande, Delvine, Himare, Gjirokaster,  Tepelene and (Premetis). Omonoia President Sotirios Kiriazatis  also went to Tirana for meetings with government officials to  discuss the persecution of the Greek minority in Albania. The  latest mass arrests and strong police presence in the towns and  villages of North Epirus have reportedly created fear among the  Greek minority. The residents of the area avoid moving far from  their homes and stay indoors after sunset.    Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias stressed that the Greek  Government condemns and protests the profound and continuous  persecution of the Greek minority by the Albanian authorities.  The foreign minister made his statement after the mass arrests  of Omonoia members in Gjirokaster yesterday. These actions, he  said, violate basic human rights and personal liberties.  Papoulias added: The Greek people, who generously welcome and  host thousands of Albanian citizens, question and feel offended  by the Albanian authorities' behavior against the Greek minority  in Albania. The foreign minister stresses that the government  will take all the necessary steps and make representations to  protect the Greek minority's internationally safeguarded rights.     "

Saro-Wiwa is president of the Movement for the Survival of  Ogoni People (MOSOP), a minority rights pressure group  representing about 500,000 people.    Soldiers arrived Sunday morning at his residence in the oil  city, surrounded the premises and prevented Saro-Wiwa from going  out and receiving visitors, the reports said. Also held in the  building with him were members of his family and some visitors  who were there the previous night.    The telephone lines of Saro-Wiwa, a former president of the  Association of Nigerian Authors, appeared to have been tampered  with and AFP was unable to contact him on Tuesday morning.    Saro-Wiwa was detained for some two months last year by the  previous military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida for  championing the cause of the Ogoni, who have in past years  complained about what they describe as the neglect, injustice  and degradation suffered by their community despite the fact  that large amounts of crude oil, the mainstay of the economy,  are produced in their area. The Ogonis are one of some 250  ethnic groups in Nigeria.    Ledum Mitee, MOSOP deputy president, and Monday Wiwa,  another  MOSOP official, were a week ago led away by soldiers to an  unknown destination, the reports said. Their arrests appeared  related to the authorities' decision to abort the celebration of  an ""Ogoni week"" scheduled to start on December 28 and to which  Saro-Wiwa was invited as a guest speaker.    The Campaign for Democracy (CD), an umbrella organisation  for  human rights groups, has condemned the arrests of these minority  rights activists in a statement and called for their immediate  release.

In 1983, in an effort to reduce the numbers of prisoners at packed city jails,  Lasker ordered 613 inmates be freed before their sentences were completed.    On Monday, municipal officials gave Lasker a plan to improve prison conditions  and asked him to defer for 30 days a suit by prisoners charging the city  violated his 1981 order against confining inmates to jail holding pens and  gymnasiums.

Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said the suspects in the cocaine case  were ""top-level people"" in the distribution of drugs shipped into the Southland  from overseas, probably through Mexico. He said a major share of the cocaine  confiscated probably had been destined for transshipment to other cities across  the United States.    In addition to the cocaine found in the van, which was stopped at a Huntington  Beach shopping center on Beach Boulevard near the San Diego Freeway, another  220 pounds were found and one suspect was arrested at a Westminster home in the  15900 block of Prince Circle. In all, almost 1,200 pounds of cocaine were  seized, authorities said.    Gates said the cocaine arrests late Monday ended a two-month investigation by  narcotics officers that began as the result of information received by  detectives. He did not explain how this information was received.    Police in Huntington Beach and Westminster said their roles in the  investigation and subsequent arrests and seizure were minimal. In both cases,  Los Angeles police telephoned the local departments and informed them of Monday  night's surveillance operation.    On Monday, the chief said, undercover officers followed Claudio Martinez, 26,  to the Pavillion Shopping Center in Westminster, where he met with Luis  Monsalve, 22, and Juan Casanova, 34. Officers said they moved in and arrested  the three, confiscating about 950 pounds of cocaine from the van driven by  Martinez.    Following these arrests, Gates said, search warrants were issued for residences  in Burbank, Los Angeles, Pico Rivera, Westminster, Huntington Beach and  Torrance. Besides the 220 pounds of cocaine found at the Prince Circle home in  Westminster, police discovered $102,895 in $5, $10, $20 and $50 bills at a home  in Torrance. Eight motor vehicles were impounded.    Flor Restrepo, 30, and her sister, Luz Restrepo, 33 -- described by Gates as  the leaders of the gang -- were arrested at an apartment in the Cahuenga Pass  area in Los Angeles, along with Carlos Montoya, 32, and a 16-year-old girl.    Faber Restrepo, 26, was arrested at an apartment in Burbank and Olga Garcia,  32, was arrested at a home in Huntington Beach. Arolino Montoya, 37, was  arrested at an apartment in Pico Rivera and Janeth Garcia, 30, was arrested as  she drove away from her home in Westminster.    The Westminster arrest surprised neighbors, who said the homeowners recently  moved to Lake Elsinore and rented out the house.    ""We haven't seen a lot of cars around here or anything,"" said one neighbor who  did not wish to be identified. ""This is a clean neighborhood, we haven't drugs  or anything like that around here. But we're glad the police arrested them.""    In Huntington Beach, where another suspect was arrested in the 8100 block of  Marseille Avenue, the former homeowner said she and her family moved out a week  and a half ago.    They sold the home to Connie Castillo and her husband, who buy homes and then  rent them. Castillo said she rented the home to two Spanish-speaking women who  had answered an advertisement in a Santa Ana newspaper.      'You Can't Go Too Deep'    ""I'm shocked,"" Castillo said. ""We painted the house and rented it. You know,  nowadays, you can't go too deep about someone's personal life and their  background.""    All the suspects were booked on suspicion of possession of cocaine with intent  to sell. Bail for each was set at $1.5 million.    Gates said no further arrests are expected in the case.    The arrests were followed by an unrelated raid during which two men were taken  into custody and more than 200 marijuana plants were confiscated at what  investigators described as a sophisticated, hydroponic farming operation at a  luxury home in San Dimas.    Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said officers from the  state Bureau of Narcotics and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, plus  a task force of 11 San Gabriel Valley police agencies, joined deputies Tuesday  morning to raid the $2-million, hilltop home where the marijuana was being  grown without soil in tanks containing nutrient-enriched water.    Ducoulombier said that, in addition to the marijuana plants, some of which were  5 to 6 feet tall, officers confiscated $350,000 in cash and more than 60  pistols, rifles and shotguns.    Rollin Scott Forteville, 38, and Jeff Jenkins, 26, were arrested at the home  and booked on suspicion of marijuana cultivation. Bail for each was set at $1  million.    The cocaine seizure by Los Angeles police apparently was the sixth largest by  the department or the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.      Record Cocaine Seizure    In August, 1987, Los Angeles police confiscated 2,135 pounds of the drug at two  locations in the San Fernando Valley in what is believed to be the record drug  bust in the area. It came just five months after the Police Department seized  1,900 pounds in another raid in Los Angeles.    About 1,800 pounds of the drug were seized in Anaheim by Los Angeles police in  April, 1986, and 1,760 pounds of cocaine were confiscated by Los Angeles County  sheriff's deputies in a home in Maywood in November, 1987. Los Angeles police  recovered 1,333 pounds of cocaine in a North Hollywood parking lot in December,  1986.

Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said the suspects in the cocaine case  were ""top-level people"" in the distribution of drugs shipped into the Southland  from overseas, probably through Mexico. He said a major share of the cocaine  confiscated probably had been destined for transshipment to other cities across  the United States.    In addition to the cocaine found in the van, which was stopped at a Huntington  Beach shopping center on Beach Boulevard near the San Diego Freeway, another  220 pounds were found and one suspect was arrested at a Westminster home in the  15900 block of Prince Circle. In all, almost 1,200 pounds of cocaine were  seized, authorities said.    Gates said the cocaine arrests late Monday ended a two-month investigation by  narcotics officers that began as the result of information received by  detectives. He did not explain how this information was received.    Police in Huntington Beach and Westminster said their roles in the  investigation and subsequent arrests and seizure were minimal. In both cases,  Los Angeles police telephoned the local departments and informed them of Monday  night's surveillance operation.    On Monday, the chief said, undercover officers followed Claudio Martinez, 26,  to the Pavillion Shopping Center in Westminster, where he met with Luis  Monsalve, 22, and Juan Casanova, 34. Officers said they moved in and arrested  the three, confiscating about 950 pounds of cocaine from the van driven by  Martinez.    Following these arrests, Gates said, search warrants were issued for residences  in Burbank, Los Angeles, Pico Rivera, Westminster, Huntington Beach and  Torrance. Besides the 220 pounds of cocaine found at the Prince Circle home in  Westminster, police discovered $102,895 in $5, $10, $20 and $50 bills at a home  in Torrance. Eight motor vehicles were impounded.    Flor Restrepo, 30, and her sister, Luz Restrepo, 33 -- described by Gates as  the leaders of the gang -- were arrested at an apartment in the Cahuenga Pass  area in Los Angeles, along with Carlos Montoya, 32, and a 16-year-old girl.    Faber Restrepo, 26, was arrested at an apartment in Burbank and Olga Garcia,  32, was arrested at a home in Huntington Beach. Arolino Montoya, 37, was  arrested at an apartment in Pico Rivera and Janeth Garcia, 30, was arrested as  she drove away from her home in Westminster.    The Westminster arrest surprised neighbors, who said the homeowners recently  moved to Lake Elsinore and rented out the house.    ""We haven't seen a lot of cars around here or anything,"" said one neighbor who  did not wish to be identified. ""This is a clean neighborhood, we haven't drugs  or anything like that around here. But we're glad the police arrested them.""    In Huntington Beach, where another suspect was arrested in the 8100 block of  Marseille Avenue, the former homeowner said she and her family moved out a week  and a half ago.    They sold the home to Connie Castillo and her husband, who buy homes and then  rent them. Castillo said she rented the home to two Spanish-speaking women who  had answered an advertisement in a Santa Ana newspaper.      'You Can't Go Too Deep'    ""I'm shocked,"" Castillo said. ""We painted the house and rented it. You know,  nowadays, you can't go too deep about someone's personal life and their  background.""    All the suspects were booked on suspicion of possession of cocaine with intent  to sell. Bail for each was set at $1.5 million.    Gates said no further arrests are expected in the case.    The arrests were followed by an unrelated raid during which two men were taken  into custody and more than 200 marijuana plants were confiscated at what  investigators described as a sophisticated, hydroponic farming operation at a  luxury home in San Dimas.    Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said officers from the  state Bureau of Narcotics and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, plus  a task force of 11 San Gabriel Valley police agencies, joined deputies Tuesday  morning to raid the $2-million, hilltop home where the marijuana was being  grown without soil in tanks containing nutrient-enriched water.    Ducoulombier said that, in addition to the marijuana plants, some of which were  5 to 6 feet tall, officers confiscated $350,000 in cash and more than 60  pistols, rifles and shotguns.    Rollin Scott Forteville, 38, and Jeff Jenkins, 26, were arrested at the home  and booked on suspicion of marijuana cultivation. Bail for each was set at $1  million.

Mr de Klerk had promised arrests within 24 hours of the attack, in which some of the country's leading politicians were chased through the corridors of the constitutional conference centre by armed men from the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement). The excuse given by police for failing to make the promised arrests - that suspects had given them false names - was dismissed as ridiculous by Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress. He pointed out that the attack was openly led by well-known politicians such as Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the rightwing Conservative party and head of the official parliamentary opposition, along with Mr Eugene Terreblanche, the AWB leader, and General Constand Viljoen, head of the Afrikaner Volksfront, an umbrella rightwing group. Mr de Klerk had promised to arrest these men, but last night they remained at liberty. Constitutional talks were scheduled to continue this week despite the attack, with Afrikaner self-determination - the issue which Friday's protest was meant to promote - at the top of the agenda. However, progress in the talks has clearly been delayed by the attack. Mr Mandela said on Saturday, as he left for a visit to the US, that he would not call as planned for international sanctions against South Africa to be lifted. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom party leader, stressed in response to the attack that the fears of white South Africans could be 'terribly destructive' and should be taken seriously. His party, which is in alliance with the Conservative party within the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag), has been severely criticised for siding with the racist right.

0,FT944-15086 ,"FT944-15086 _AN-EJTEUABPFT 941020   FT  20 OCT 94 / Hamas raises terror campaign to new pitch in Israel: The attacks have now come to dominate the political agenda of both Yassir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin      By JULIAN OZANNE   The devastating bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv yesterday marks the increasing confidence and power of Hamas, the militant Islamic group, which has pledged to destroy the peace process, the state of Israel, and usher in an Islamic republic based on Koranic law. An anonymous caller told Israel radio that the bombing had been carried out in the name of some 400 Hamas activists expelled by Israel for several months to a no-man's land in Lebanon in December 1992. He said he wanted to thank the government for deporting the Hamas members where they had received training in sabotage and explosives. 'We know how to carry out attacks and we will carry out other attacks,' he said. The threat is very real. In the past fortnight, Hamas has struck a new level of terror into the heart of Israeli society; spraying a busy Jerusalem shopping promenade with bullets and killing two people; kidnapping and killing a 19-year-old Israeli soldier; and carrying out yesterday's attack in the commercial centre of Tel Aviv. Its increasingly successful military campaign against Israeli civilians and soldiers has come to dominate the political agenda of both Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister. The attacks have shown that Hamas has the political initiative and can influence the pace of the peace process. Furthermore it has now laid down an open challenge to Mr Arafat for the leadership of the Palestinian people and defied him to take repressive measures at the risk of civil war. Experts on the extremist movement, which has a growing support base of between 20-40 per cent of Gaza's 850,000 residents, say Hamas does not want Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin to suspend the peace process. Rather their strategy is to cripple it, thereby ensuring that Mr Arafat fails to deliver on his promises to his people of new jobs, alleviation of poverty and a gradual assumption of legitimate Palestinian rights. These include the return of Israeli-occupied land, the right of return of up to 4m Palestinian refugees and the establishment of an independent state, with Arab East Jerusalem as its capital. Each time Hamas carries out an attack Israel seals off the Gaza Strip, preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians from travelling to their jobs inside Israel. Last week Israel briefly suspended peace talks following the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier. Such moves play into the hands of Hamas by showing Palestinians how weak Mr Arafat is, and how dependent on Israeli goodwill. Israeli demands for Mr Arafat to smash the military wing of Hamas are also easily exploited by the Islamic group as Mr Arafat doing Israel's dirty work for them. Last week's mass arrests of Hamas activists in Gaza by Mr Arafat's security forces were met with demonstrations and riots, accompanied by threats of civil war. Hamas's military wing warned Mr Arafat that if he continued arresting its supporters it would reply 'by setting the Gaza Strip ablaze'. Hamas continues to benefit from the very limited gains Palestinians have reaped from the peace process and the poor performance so far of the ineffectual Palestinian authority. Like other militant Islamic groups, Hamas thrives on despondency, poverty and the failure of secular Arab governments to restore pride and economic wellbeing to their peoples. Many Palestinians feel Mr Arafat gave up the Palestinian struggle in return for a virtual bantustan in a part of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Months after the PLO was supposed to have taken over the West Bank and held elections, Mr Arafat's peace negotiators remain locked in negotiations with Israel in Cairo. Furthermore, after three months in power, Mr Arafat has yet to put together a credible government capable of tackling the massive task of rehabilitating the derelict Gaza Strip and combating an unemployment rate of 40-50 per cent. Part of his failures are self-imposed - a result of centralisation of power and an aversion to transparent government. International donors, choking on their own bureaucracy, are also to blame for the slow drip of promised emergency funds. As Mr Arafat struggles to deliver real economic and political change, Hamas continues to provide better services through its social welfare network of schools, clinics and kindergartens. Hamas also offers a strong moral message and a religious certainty in a period of upheaval and instability. In a recent interview, Mr Mahmoud Zohar, a leading Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said his organisation welcomed the return of Mr Arafat to Gaza because his obvious failures would expose the moral, economic and political bankruptcy of secular Arab government and encourage Palestinians to turn to the Islamic solution. 'Arafat's return hastens the coming of the Islamic state,' he said. But it is not just Mr Arafat's failings that contribute to the flow of recruits to Hamas. Hatred and suspicion of Israel remain deeply rooted in the hearts of many Palestinians. Even amongst PLO supporters, Hamas is viewed as a 'liberation organisation', fighting a legitimate battle against continued Israeli occupation of their land and denial of their rights. Mr Arafat will now come under renewed pressure from Israel to deal a decisive blow to Hamas. For Israel, peace means increased security. During last week's kidnap crisis Mr Rabin said: 'Arafat must choose between making peace with Israel or making peace with Hamas'. It is an acute dilemma for Mr Arafat, while still trying to find his feet as leader of a people in a nascent state. If Mr Arafat does not move against Hamas he risks allowing Israel to continue dragging its feet in talks and so ensuring the vacuum which Hamas so readily exploits.

Jose Dioniso Suarez y Esquivel, 51, described as a member of a New Jersey-based  anti-Castro group that has long been accused of terrorist activity, had eluded  arrest since 1978 when he and seven others were charged with first-degree  murder and conspiracy in the mid-morning explosion that demolished Letelier's  car as he was driving along Washington's Embassy Row.

They were booked on  kidnaping and robbery charges Friday but disappeared from the 77th Street  Station during the weekend.    Gates blamed the escape on overcrowding. The jail, he said, is so crowded that  inmates are fed in the hallways; it has room for 15 people but housed 45 felons  over the weekend.    But he admitted that the escape is embarrassing and that it is under  investigation. Bates and Wright were discovered missing Monday morning as  police prepared for the press conference.      Offers No Excuse    ""There is no excuse for losing prisoners of this magnitude,"" he said. ""These  are people who need to go to jail for a long time.""    In the other raid, 20 people were arrested on Wednesday when federal and local  agents converged on 11 locations in a 10-block area of South-Central Los  Angeles, Gates said.    Nine were held on federal counts of selling narcotics and transferred to  federal custody. The 11 others were booked on drug and misdemeanor charges.    Two pounds of rock cocaine and three guns were also confiscated.    Most of the people arrested belong to the 46th Street Hustlers, a subset of the  Crips gang, police said.

The killing of  Palestinians by Israeli soldiers or settlers is a daily reality  that has become of routine news value to the international  media, and even less significance to the international community.    Only a crime of the enormity of the Hebron massacre draws  the  attention of the big powers in the world to the suffering of the  Palestinian people and Israel's disregard for all international  norms and human values. This attention fades, though, sooner  than the blood of Palestinians dries on the ground.    Such is not the case with violence against Israelis. The  killing of any number of Israelis by frustrated Palestinians has  all world capitals racing to condemn ""Arab acts of terrorism""  and offer support for Israel.    The world is serving neither the Palestinians nor the  Israelis through such exercises in hypocrisy. Nor is Israel  protecting its future and that of the region by failing to  address the root causes of violence in the occupied territories.    Israel is responsible for the 'Afula bombing as much as it  is  responsible for the Hebron massacre. Its policies in the  occupied territories provided the settlers with the means for  killing the Palestinians as they prayed in the Ibrahimi Mosque.  Those same policies left the young Palestinian who carried out  the 'Afula suicide attack no choice but to give Israelis a taste  of what their government has been allowing to happen to  Palestinians for decades.    Israeli politicians condemned the Hebron massacre. So should  Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat condemn the 'Afula bombing  demands the U.S. and other world powers. The naivety and  insensitivity of comparing the two unfortunate events are  appalling, even though the killing of innocent people and  civilians cannot be condoned by anybody or quarter.    Had the international community been genuinely interested in  ending the bloodshed in the occupied territories, however, it  would have had taken action to end it long before the 'Afula  bombing took place. That it could have done by putting enough  pressure on Israel to remove the injustices to which  Palestinians are subjected on a daily basis. Instead of  removing the settlers, admittedly a main obstacle to the  attainment of peace in the region, Israel threw a blanket curfew  on the West Bank and Gaza. That deprived Palestinians from even  providing for their daily needs. The suffering increased and  retaliatory action became an inevitable response.    The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman thus  found himself unable to condemn the 'Afula attack personally.  By doing so, he might have only infuriated his people whose  members are being killed by Israelis by the hour. Israel, on  the other hand, could affoprd to condemn the Hebron massacre  because it has within its reach tens of other measures to  appease its citizens.    The most the PLO can do in reaction to Israeli atrocities is  boycott the peace talks, and that it cannot do for long because  of the pressures that Washington and other world powers would  put on it.    But Israel does not boycott the talks, winning world praise  for not allowing ""rejectionists"" to abort the peace process.  What it does, instead, is put two million Palestinians under  siege again by closing the West Bank and Gaza totally. The  negative implications of this act for the peace process far  exceed those of withdrawing from the negotiation. Yet a few in  the world community seem to notice; and Israel gets away with  murder.    Thus only Palestinian desperation grows, and the cycle of  violence continues unabated. When inclination towards peace  becomes the ultimate causalty we can all be sure that the peace  process stands to suffer. Just when the Israelis get to realise  the folly of their policies is the question that we cannot  answer.     "

A major government offensive against the black and mainly  Christian rebels, weakened by internal divisions, has driven  more than 100,000 southerners towards the Ugandan border. ""We  have had reports of a massive military buildup along the border  with the Central African Republic, and there are similar reports  from Zaire,"" Michael Semmler of the German relief agency Action  Africa in Need told a news conference in the Kenyan capital  Nairobi after a two-day visit to rebel-held territory in  southern Sudan.    Justin arop Yac of the relief wing of the rebel Sudan  People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said Khartoum had ""bribed local  officials"" to turn a blind eye to the massing of Sudanese troops  in remote, notoriously lawless areas of Zaire and the Central  African Republic bordering Sudan. ""Most of the soldiers are  just young boys, aged 12 to 15,"" Yac told AFP. Several foreign  relief agencies said they had also received persistent reports  of child soldiers grouped just over the borders ready to attack  the rebels from behind. The number of troops reportedly poised  to attack was unknown.    UN officials said aid to millions of Sudanese verging on  starvation in the drought-hit south has been disrupted by a  recent government ban on relief flights to key areas along the  border. The ban was apparently timed to cut off food to  southerners as the government offensive gathered momentum,  private relief officials said.    The onslaught by government warplanes and tens of thousands  of troops could be Khartoum's final push to crush the southern  rebellion, diplomats and aid workers said.    The United Nations has warned foreign aid workers and  missionaries around Yambio, near the southern border with Zaire,  that they may be endangered by fighting as the government  presses on with a major offensive against the rebels. Most aid  workers have already withdrawn from areas near the Ugandan  border.    Four nuns and three priests of the Comboni order have been  told to leave Nzara, a few kilometres (miles) west of Yambio,  Semmler said.    He confirmed a claim by John Garang's mainstream SPLA  faction  to have recaptured the southern town of Mundri, near the Zairean  border, last weekend, only hours after it fell to government  troops.    Semmler appealed to the UN security council to enforce a  ""no-fly zone"" over southern Sudan to stop the government bombing  civilians and force it to allow in food aid. ""The war is no  longer a military war where armies fight each other,"" Semmler  said. ""It is a war where the government of Sudan fights the  civilian population in the south. This war is an ongoing human  rights violation.""    The US government has protested against the bombing of  civilians in rebel-held areas by government warplanes, and UN  secretary-general Butros Butros-Ghali has also expressed concern.    Khartoum denies the offensive and blames unrest in the south  on fighting between Garang's faction and an SPLA splinter group  led by Riak Machar who broke with Garang in 1991.    An AFP correspondent, however, witnessed a government  bombing  raid last week on Pageri village, near the town of Nimule on the  Ugandan border, that killed seven people.    Yac said the Arabic-speaking northerners were waging ""a  genocidal war, a war of ethnic cleansing"" against the black  southerners, and were deliberately trying to starve civilians.    He backed Mashar's recent accusation that the government was  organising slave raids on southern villages, and settling  Arabic- speaking northerners on land seized from the largely  Christian and animist Africans.    Relief officials said dozens of Sudanese boys had recently  returned to Sudan from a refugee camp in northern Kenya  sheltering more than 10,000 boys separated from their families  by the decade-old war. There was speculation that they had gone  to join rebel fighters, the officials said.     "

LONG, Times Staff Writer      LA PAZ, Bolivia      American FBI agents have helped track down members of a terrorist group wanted  for a bomb attack last August on the U.S. secretary of state's motorcade and  for the slaying in May of two Mormon missionaries from Utah.    The self-styled Zarate Willka Armed Forces of Liberation, a Marxist group named  after an obscure Indian rebel of the late 1800s, claimed responsibility for  both attacks. At week's end, authorities said that eight front members were  under arrest and that at least three of them had participated directly in the  bombing or the killings.    Some of those arrested had once worked in a military government's  ""paramilitary"" intelligence service, Bolivian officials said. The U.S. Embassy  said that at least one had received training in Cuba.    In 1967, Cuba sponsored a guerrilla band led by revolutionary hero Ernesto  (Che) Guevara in rural Bolivia. With the aid of U.S. advisers, Bolivian army  rangers hunted the guerrillas down and killed Guevara in October, 1967.      First Group Since 1970s    Other small Bolivian guerrilla groups were defeated early in the 1970s. Since  then, Zarate Willka is the first armed rebel organization to surface in this  landlocked country, the poorest in South America.    Few people had heard of the Zarate Willka group when it claimed responsibility  for the dynamite bomb that damaged four cars in the motorcade bringing George  P. Shultz, then secretary of state, into La Paz on Aug. 8. No one was injured  in the blast.    In January, the group set off a bomb at the National Congress Building. Again,  no one was hurt.    But on May 25, the terrorist band announced the ""execution"" of two young Mormon  missionaries minutes after they were shot to death on their doorstep with an  automatic assault rifle.    A handwritten statement delivered to a newspaper declared that ""the violation  of our national sovereignty"" by ""Yankee invaders"" would not go unpunished. ""Our  hate is implacable and our war is to the death,"" the message said.    The victims were roommates Todd Ray Wilson and Jeffrey Brent Ball, both 20 and  both from small towns in Utah. They had been in Bolivia about a year, doing  door-to-door proselytizing for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.    There are about 400 Mormon missionaries in Bolivia, half of them young  Americans who have saved their own money to pay for their missions.    Wilson and Ball were returning to their rented room in a house near the La Paz  cemetery when a yellow Volkswagen station wagon stopped nearby. Witnesses said  that a man got out of the car and opened fire on the two as they prepared to  enter the house.    Dr. Ramiro Donoso, a Bolivian physician who is active in the church, said other  missionaries in Bolivia were horrified by the slayings.    ""There was fear, to the point that the missionaries didn't go out to work for  several days,"" Donoso said.    But now they are working normally and have had no more trouble, he said. ""I  think the thing has been against Americans instead of against the church.""    U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Gelbard said that Bolivia's extreme left, unable to  win mass allegiance, uses the United States as a scapegoat for its failure.  Marxist politicians accused the United States of violating Bolivian sovereignty  with anti-drug and military aid programs.    Gelbard said the terrorists struck out at the missionaries ""because the Mormons  in their eyes are symbolic of the United States.""    After the slayings, a special six-member team of FBI agents came to work with  Bolivian police in the investigation. The FBI brought lie detectors, ballistics  laboratory equipment and other instruments.    Some observers say that a $500,000 reward offered by the United States for  information leading to the conviction of the killers also may have helped in  the investigation.    On Thursday, the interior and information ministers announced the arrests of  several Zarate Willka members, including two university students and a medical  doctor.    Constantino Yujra, a sociology student, ""confessed having participated in the  attack on Mr. George Shultz,"" Interior Minister Eduardo Perez Beltran said.    On Friday, police arrested two brothers, Felix and Nestor Encinas, accused of  killing the Mormons.    Still at large are the group's leader, identified only as ""Horacio,"" and his  second-in-command, ""Sapo"" -- the Spanish word for toad.    Information Minister Herman Antelo said that there is no evidence that the  Zarate Willka band is linked to any Bolivian political party or foreign  organization. There had been speculation that it received support from the  Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas of neighboring Peru, who  assassinated the Peruvian naval attache in La Paz last December.      Trained in Cuba    Ambassador Gelbard said in an interview that one man under arrest, Julio  Penaranda, received bomb training in Cuba.    ""It's pure Cuban terrorism, I don't think there is any question about it,"" the  ambassador said. He added that the Zarate Willka group has been wounded but not  crushed.    ""My concern is that in the short term this will cause the group to lash out and  show they are still effective,"" Gelbard said. ""I think they still would like to  do something spectacular.""

Section 503(b) of IMMACT requires fingerprinting and photographing of any alien fourteen years of age or older against whom deportation proceedings have been commenced under section 242 of the Act, and dictates that such fingerprints be made available to law enforcement agencies upon request. Finally, section 503(a) of IMMACT requires, as a condition of immigration officers' authority to make warrantless arrests under amended section 287(a)(5)(B) for felonies, the Attorney General to publish final regulations that define the categories of immigration officers who may use force, including deadly force, and the circumstances under which such force may be used; establish standards with respect to enforcement activities of the Service; require that no immigration officer be authorized to make arrests under section 287(a)(5)(B) of the Act unless that officer has been certified as having completed a training program covering such arrests and standards and establish an expedited internal review process for violations of such standards.

Western officials were describing the latest Libyan proposal, which appears similar to one last month, as a 'non-starter.' Britain and the US are insisting they try the men under British or US criminal jurisdictions. The latest Libyan offer was forwarded to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, a day after a special seven-member committee of Arab foreign ministers met in Cairo to seek fresh avenues for compromise before UN sanctions, including an arms and air embargo, come into effect on April 15. The UN is also pressing Libya to allow France access to four men, including Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's brother-in-law, wanted for questioning in connection with the 1989 downing of a French UTA aircraft over Niger in which all 171 passengers and crew died. Arab League officials held out little hope of a breakthrough in efforts to prevent implementation of UN sanctions resolution 748, passed after Libya's persistent refusal to comply with an earlier demand that it hand over the two men for trial in connection with the Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, the UN undersecretary-general for political affairs, left Tripoli yesterday for Geneva where he was due to report to Mr Boutros Ghali. Mr Petrovsky, sent to Libya to explain the UN stand, appears to have made little progress in his discussions with the Libyan authorities. Arab officials said they would continue their efforts to defuse the Libyan crisis, but admit that prospects of a breakthrough are slim. The seven member Arab League committee, grouping Egypt, Syria, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania is due to meet again on Sunday, three days before the sanctions are due to go into effect.

This was announced by Police Commissioner Johan van der  Merwe  at a special press conference held at Caeser's Palace,  Braamfontein, where exhibits and a special video tape was made  available to the media. He said teams of SAP [South African  Police] members had worked around the clock for the past few  days to hunt down those responsible for the blasts and to  prevent further blasts.    ""The result was a remarkable breakthrough resulting in 31  arrests,"" he said.    The arrests were carried out in Rustenberg, Ventersdorp and  Pretoria and involved the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging's [AWB,  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] elite Ystergarde [Iron Guard].    Gen van der Merwe said some had given themselves up and that  those arrested included a police reservist. Those arrested were  the brains of the group and it could not be excluded that others  were involved, including leaders, but this was currently under  further investigation.    The first suspect was arrested and held under Section 29 of  the Internal Security Act on Sunday, but the rest were regular  arrests, gen van der merwe said. He said the suspects were being  held at various locations which were being kept secret.    The successful results were primarily the product of good  intelligence work, he said.    Those arrests were all allegedly connected to the bombs  which were detonated in central Johannesburg on Sunday, at the  Germiston taxi rank on Monday, the Pretoria restaurant on Monday  night and Wednesday's Jan Smuts Airport blast. The three  explosions claimed 21 lives and injured 173 people.    Other blasts where only material damage was caused were also  being linked to the group. These occurred at taxi ranks in  Randfontein and Westonaria on Monday morning.     "

The court ruled that confessions made by Miss Ward, 43, to the M62 attack and two other bombings could no longer be relied on and her conviction was therefore 'unsafe and unsatisfactory'. Lord Justice Glidewell told her that her appeal would be allowed in due course but the court wanted to continue hearing evidence on scientific aspects of the case. At her trial in 1974, scientific evidence was presented by Dr Frank Skuse, the former Home Office forensic scientist, that Miss Ward had handled nitroglycerine. The test used was discredited last year during the appeal of the Birmingham Six. Miss Ward, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to life imprisonment with concurrent 30-year terms for complicity in the other bombings, in spite of evidence, available at the time, that she was mentally ill and prone to inventing stories about her involvement with the IRA. Her release after 18 years in jail brings to an end a series of miscarriages of justice stemming from the 1974 IRA mainland bombing campaign. The cases of the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven and the Birmingham Six prompted the government to appoint a royal commission on criminal justice under the chairmanship of Lord Runciman. The commission's report, to be published next year, is expected to lead to an overhaul of the criminal appeal system. West Yorkshire police, who investigated the M62 bombing, last night expressed regret for the years Miss Ward had spent in prison. Mr Tom Cook, assistant chief constable, said they would re-examine evidence gathered at the time of the bombing.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

The 9am rush-hour attack by Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel, suggests that the militant Islamic group is intensifying its campaign of violence. The bombing has further divided supporters and opponents of peace among both Israelis and Palestinians. Last night Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said he would take tough measures against Hamas. Mr Rabin, who cut short a visit to Britain after the worst attack on Israelis in 16 years, indicated he would propose measures to cabinet today that would displease human rights groups. He warned that the families and homes of suicide bombers would not be safe. President Bill Clinton said the bombing was 'an outrage against the conscience of the world' and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, condemned the attack and offered to help track down those responsible. Mr Arafat's statement highlighted the growing tension between the PLO and Hamas, which has mounted an open challenge to his authority and vowed to 'set Gaza ablaze' if the PLO continued arresting its members. Israel immediately sealed off the Gaza Strip and West Bank, preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians travelling to their jobs in Israel. Later, 18 Israeli demonstrators were arrested in Jerusalem and an Arab's house was reported to have been set on fire in the West Bank. However, Mr Ephrahim Sneh, Israel's health minister, said the PLO peace talks would not be halted:  'We will continue the day and night war against terrorism. We will fight them and defeat them and kill them, but we are not going to grant Hamas the political victory of stopping the peace process.' The blast came two days after the initialling of a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, which had raised hopes that political barriers were falling in the Middle East. A signing ceremony is due to be held next week, and Mr Clinton has said he will attend. Israel's opposition rightwing political parties furiously criticised the government in parliament. Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud party leader, said Mr Rabin was responsible for allowing Gaza to become 'a terrorist haven to prepare murderous deeds'. He demanded the construction of a fence around Gaza. Hamas, which last week kidnapped and killed a 19-year-old Israeli soldier, warned of more attacks and said yesterday's bombing had 'lifted the spirits of the Palestinian people'. The bomb blast created carnage and destruction in one of the busiest shopping streets in cosmopolitan Tel Aviv, known for its cafes and boutiques. Bodies, severed limbs, shredded clothes and possessions were strewn across the street near the city's main shopping mall and crushed under the smoking wreckage of the commuter bus. Witnesses said some of the dead had been sitting at outdoor cafes or walking along the street. The bomb threw up flames 40 feet high. 'There was a huge blast and I was lifted off my feet,' said Sarah Pal, in a second-storey apartment opposite the blast. Angry residents gathered, chanting anti-Arab and anti-government slogans. 'We don't want Arabs to come to our city,' said Daniel Minis. 'Gaza must be closed and Rabin should get out.' In a sign of the deep sense of national tragedy, Israelis, for the first time, hung black flags from their balconies - a regular Palestinian mourning ritual. Prof Yona Alexander, a terrorism expert based in Tel Aviv, said the attack underscored Hamas's message that it had 'a long arm and could decide where and when it is going to strike'.

Four of the arrested were released after preliminary  interrogations, Colonel Reza Mohammadi, a law enforcement  officer based in central Tehran told IRNA.    Some ofthe detainees have confessed to having links with the  Iraq-based terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), the  colonel said.    Shortly after the bomb blast at Ferdowsi Square an  unidentified caller who introduced herself as MKO spokesman in  Paris claimed responsibility for the bombing which injured three  passers-by, one critically.    The officer disclosed that some arms and ammunition have  also  been seized from those arrested.    He said because of the ongoing interrogation it was not  possible for him to identify the arrested people by name. But  he said they had acknowledged to have received instructions from  Baghdad and Paris to carry out sabotage activities throughout  Tehran.    MKO members, better known in Iran as monafeqin (hypocrites)  have launched a string of terrorist attacks since the fleeing to  Paris of Maryam Qajar Azadanlou, the third wife of MKO  ringleader Masoud Rajavi.    Among the terrorist attacks launched by MKO members were  hijacking of a passenger plane to Iraq, attacks on the French  Embassy and Air France office in Tehran, shooting at the British  Embassy and two bomb explosions in Tehran.    Commenting on the connection between the bomb blast at  Ferdowsi Square and the MKO, Mahmud Javadi, a political expert,  said:    ""At present, MKO terrorists cannot leave Iraq without  getting  permission from the Baghdad regime and that Western countries  are reluctant to admit members of this criminal grouplet. So  the MKO seems to have decided to perpetrate such actions out of  helplessness.""    Javadi said that the aim of the MKO in committing such  crimes was to convince the Baghdad regime that it was still able  to involve in sabotage actions inside Iran.     "

EXPANDED DRUG DEALING PROMPTED THE TWO-DAY OPERATION, AGENTS SAY.      By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      More than 160 suspected affiliates of the Los Angeles-based Crips and Bloods  gangs were arrested in a novel two-day sweep by federal agents seeking to check  a national migration of the city's street violence, authorities announced  Friday.    In what they dubbed ""Operation Streetsweep,"" agents from the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms arrested 166 people in 11 states and seized an unspecified  amount of drugs, guns and cash. The raids began early Thursday and were not  expected to end until late Friday night, ATF officials said.    Agents said the sweep -- two years in preparation -- was prompted by the  budding expansion of the gangs' drug-dealing operations out of Southern  California and into other corners of the country. In recent years, members of  Crips, Bloods and other L.A. street gangs have been identified in scores of  cities across the country.    ""The Crips and Bloods were targeted because their level of violence has spread  with the spread of drugs,"" ATF Special Agent Andrew Vita told a Los Angeles  press conference. ""We have investigations going in 32 other states and 69 other  cities.""    Vita said 135 gang members were arrested in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San  Bernardino and San Diego counties. Other arrests were scattered across Northern  California and 10 other states, including Louisiana, Oregon, Arizona, Missouri,  Oklahoma and Washington.    Another 100 were expected to be arrested later Friday and through the weekend.    ""We managed to get about 75% to 80% of those we were looking for,"" Vita said.  ""We hope to get the rest soon.""    In San Diego County, five gang members have been arrested since the sweep  began, and more arrests are expected, according to a press release from the  local ATF office.    The county probation office assisted the sweep by providing the names of five  known gang members who are on probation in the area, said Tom Pautler, director  of special operations. Probation officials told the bureau whether the  condition of the gang members' probation allows searches of their residences  without warrants, Pautler said.    ""We did not go out in the field on this,"" he said. ""We strictly provided (the  ATF) information on probationers.""    Neither San Diego city police nor the county Sheriff's Department was involved  in the sweep.    ATF agents said the gang members were arrested on a variety of federal gun and  drug charges. Arraignments began early Friday in U.S district courts around the  country for those apprehended, but by late afternoon none were believed to have  been released.    Officials said one motivation for Operation Streetsweep was that federal  sentencing laws generally are harsher than local statutes. The ATF's major  weapon is the federal Gun Control Act, which provides tough sentencing  provisions -- a minimum of five years in prison -- for use of firearms in drug  trafficking, regardless of the amount of narcotics involved.    ""The local agencies can't get them into federal court without help from federal  agents,"" said Stephen E. Higgins, director of ATF, who appeared at the Los  Angeles press conference. ""In federal court, many of those without felonies  will face a minimum of five years. Those with felonies are looking at 15 years  -- no probation, no parole.""    At the same time, the operation -- not unlike many such law enforcement  ""crackdowns"" -- had the trappings of symbolic gesture, a characterization that  the agents permitted to flourish. On some of the raids in Los Angeles, for  example, television news crews were allowed to accompany law enforcement agents  to film the busts.    ""We're trying to show that the gang problem is not just limited to Los  Angeles,"" said Vita, speaking on the steps of the Naval Training Center. ""It's  a nationwide problem and we believe the federal government can have some  impact.""    Added Higgins: ""What began as a Los Angeles problem has now spread to a  national one. This is a significant step to our commitment attacking drugs"" and  was ""intended to send a message to violent street gangs.""    Some local drug investigators around the country were a bit baffled by the  fanfare with which the arrests were announced. Oklahoma City Police Maj. Bob  Tayor said his department's involvement in Operation Streetsweep began when  federal agents ""contacted us and said they wanted to do one (a raid) here.""    Taylor said officers then led the federal agents on a raid of a local crack  house, where five local people were arrested for involvement with drugs  believed to have been supplied by an L.A. gang. Taylor described those arrested  as gang ""wannabes.""    In South Los Angeles, where many of the arrests occurred, some residents  contended that the agents' attempt at sending a message to gang members was  misguided.    ""We must stop the source of drugs at the point of entry,"" said Chilton  Alphonse, founder of the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, which  provides counseling to gang members. ""Black children do not have the means --  the boats and the planes -- to be bringing drugs into this country. . . .  Government and law enforcement should be attacking the supply, those  individuals importing cocaine into the country.""    Aside from being misdirected, said residents, such efforts are just plain  ineffective.    ""The CRASH nights (sporadically scheduled sweeps by Los Angeles police  officers) caught some people by surprise,"" said a former gang member who  identified himself as Lil' Too Tall. ""But people got used to them real fast. .  . . Dope sellers would just kick it (rest) and come out on nights the police  weren't around.""    ATF officials said operations such as Streetsweep have potential as a weapon  against street gangs, and they said without elaboration that there would be  more in the future.    Agents said other law enforcement agencies were involved in Operation  Streetsweep, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department and the U.S. attorney's office.    In addition, the Air Force supplied a C-5A jet to ferry 22 federal agents to  Southern California Thursday to make -- and announce -- arrests. Air Force  pilots unloaded participating agents at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in  Orange County. It was the first time any military branch has joined domestic  drug-fighting efforts, they said.    ""We needed the extra agents because we didn't have enough in our Los Angeles  district office alone,"" said Vita. ""We knew this would be big, so we called for  added help.""    Operation Streetsweep marked the culmination of two years of planning by the  law enforcement agencies, Higgins said. The original idea for the massive  crackdown began evolving from the federal government's ongoing battle with the  fierce Jamaican drug-dealing gangs, called ""posses,"" that are terrorizing  several East Coast cities.    Alarmed by the spread of the posses and gangs, Higgins said, the U.S. Justice  Department recruited the ATF to stem the illegal gun-running that often goes  hand-in-hand with the drug trade.    ""We saw that the posses were spreading, and what they are doing was similar to  what the gangs in Los Angeles are doing,"" said Higgins, whose agency has  monitored the national migration of Crips and Bloods for more than a year. ""The  posses are spreading West and the Los Angeles gangs are going eastward.""    ATF officials said that some illegal Jamaican immigrants were arrested during  Operation Streetsweep, but they were unsure if the nationals belong to any  posses. Still, authorities acknowledged that posses are active in Los Angeles  and a few even work in concert with the Crips and the Bloods.    Last spring, one agent from each of the ATF's 22 national offices flew into Los  Angeles for briefings on the gangs with the LAPD and the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department, Higgins said.    Operation Streetsweep began at dawn Thursday and many of the arrests were made  simultaneously across the country.    Times staff writers Jim Carlton, John H. Lee, Paul Lieberman and Henry  Weinstein contributed to this report.

The county probation office assisted the sweep by providing the names of five  known gang members who are on probation in the area, said Tom Pautler, director  of special operations. Probation officials told the bureau whether the  condition of the gang members' probation allows searches of their residences  without warrants, Pautler said.    ""We did not go out in the field on this,"" he said. ""We strictly provided (the  ATF) information on probationers.""    Neither San Diego city police nor the county Sheriff's Department was involved  in the sweep.    ATF agents said the gang members were arrested on a variety of federal gun and  drug charges. Arraignments began early Friday in U.S district courts around the  country for those apprehended, but by late afternoon none were believed to have  been released.    Officials said one motivation for Operation Streetsweep was that federal  sentencing laws generally are harsher than local statutes. The ATF's major  weapon is the federal Gun Control Act, which provides tough sentencing  provisions -- a minimum of five years in prison -- for use of firearms in drug  trafficking, regardless of the amount of narcotics involved.    ""The local agencies can't get them into federal court without help from federal  agents,"" said Stephen E. Higgins, director of ATF, who appeared at the Los  Angeles press conference. ""In federal court, many of those without felonies  will face a minimum of five years. Those with felonies are looking at 15 years  -- no probation, no parole.""    At the same time, the operation -- not unlike many such law enforcement  ""crackdowns"" -- had the trappings of symbolic gesture, a characterization that  the agents permitted to flourish. On some of the raids in Los Angeles, for  example, television news crews were allowed to accompany law enforcement agents  to film the busts.    ""We're trying to show that the gang problem is not just limited to Los  Angeles,"" said Vita, speaking on the steps of the Naval Training Center. ""It's  a nationwide problem and we believe the federal government can have some  impact.""    Added Higgins: ""What began as a Los Angeles problem has now spread to a  national one. This is a significant step to our commitment attacking drugs"" and  was ""intended to send a message to violent street gangs.""    Some local drug investigators around the country were a bit baffled by the  fanfare with which the arrests were announced. Oklahoma City Police Maj. Bob  Tayor said his department's involvement in Operation Streetsweep began when  federal agents ""contacted us and said they wanted to do one (a raid) here.""    Taylor said officers then led the federal agents on a raid of a local crack  house, where five local people were arrested for involvement with drugs  believed to have been supplied by an L.A. gang. Taylor described those arrested  as gang ""wannabes.""    In South Los Angeles, where many of the arrests occurred, some residents  contended that the agents' attempt at sending a message to gang members was  misguided.    ""We must stop the source of drugs at the point of entry,"" said Chilton  Alphonse, founder of the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, which  provides counseling to gang members. ""Black children do not have the means --  the boats and the planes -- to be bringing drugs into this country. . . .  Government and law enforcement should be attacking the supply, those  individuals importing cocaine into the country.""    Aside from being misdirected, said residents, such efforts are just plain  ineffective.    ""The CRASH nights (sporadically scheduled sweeps by Los Angeles police  officers) caught some people by surprise,"" said a former gang member who  identified himself as Lil' Too Tall. ""But people got used to them real fast. .  . . Dope sellers would just kick it (rest) and come out on nights the police  weren't around.""    ATF officials said operations such as Streetsweep have potential as a weapon  against street gangs, and they said without elaboration that there would be  more in the future.    Agents said other law enforcement agencies were involved in Operation  Streetsweep, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department and the U.S. attorney's office.    In addition, the Air Force supplied a C-5A jet to ferry 22 federal agents to  Southern California Thursday to make -- and announce -- arrests. Air Force  pilots unloaded participating agents at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in  Orange County. It was the first time any military branch has joined domestic  drug-fighting efforts, they said.    ""We needed the extra agents because we didn't have enough in our Los Angeles  district office alone,"" said Vita. ""We knew this would be big, so we called for  added help.""    Operation Streetsweep marked the culmination of two years of planning by the  law enforcement agencies, Higgins said. The original idea for the massive  crackdown began evolving from the federal government's ongoing battle with the  fierce Jamaican drug-dealing gangs, called ""posses,"" that are terrorizing  several East Coast cities.    Alarmed by the spread of the posses and gangs, Higgins said, the U.S. Justice  Department recruited the ATF to stem the illegal gun-running that often goes  hand-in-hand with the drug trade.    ""We saw that the posses were spreading, and what they are doing was similar to  what the gangs in Los Angeles are doing,"" said Higgins, whose agency has  monitored the national migration of Crips and Bloods for more than a year. ""The  posses are spreading West and the Los Angeles gangs are going eastward.""    ATF officials said that some illegal Jamaican immigrants were arrested during  Operation Streetsweep, but they were unsure if the nationals belong to any  posses. Still, authorities acknowledged that posses are active in Los Angeles  and a few even work in concert with the Crips and the Bloods.    Last spring, one agent from each of the ATF's 22 national offices flew into Los  Angeles for briefings on the gangs with the LAPD and the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department, Higgins said.    Operation Streetsweep began at dawn Thursday and many of the arrests were made  simultaneously across the country.    Times staff writers Jim Carlton, John H. Lee, Paul Lieberman and Henry  Weinstein contributed to this report.      Full Run    "

This developed as Southern Command chief Major General  Thelmo  Cunanan endorsed an investigation of the relatives of the  victims in the 26 December bombing of the cathedral to find out  if they have knowledge in the ""retaliatory"" attacks on the  mosques.    ""Let us join together to identify (those involved) and bring  them into the open to expose their evil agenda and let them  answer their ungodly and barbaric acts,"" MILF spokesman Mohagher  Iqbal said in a press statement on Tuesday.    But Iqbal warned the government to avoid ""witchhunting as  what had happened in the Buluan massacre,"" an incident that also  almost sparked a Muslim-Christian conflict.    Iqbal was referring to the 13 December ambush-massacre in  which 10 bus passengers were killed and 10 others wounded in  Buluan, Maguindanao which the military blamed to a certain MILF  Kumander [Commander] Ustadz Dua Mantio.    ""Kumander Dua was made the sacrificial lamb for a crime he  was never involved in,"" Iqbal said, adding that Dua was found  innocent of the charges in an MILF initiated investigation.    Iqbal said the Davao City bombings were ""befitting only to  barbarians, ungodly and bloodthirsty"" who ""deserve the highest  condemnation of every sane, upright and God-believing individual  or group.""    The MILF spokesman also appealed to the people of Davao City  and nearby areas to ""observe sobriety, patience and perseverance  in the face of this machination to drive a wedge between our  peoples.""    In the same statement, Iqbal reaffirmed the MILF support to  the on-going peace talks between its rival Moro National  Liberation Front and the government, which he considered a hope  leading to the implementation of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement.    ""If any group cannot contribute to this forward move (peace  talks), at least it must stop rocking the boat of peace and  autonomy,"" Iqbal said.     "

At the same time, Scotland  Yard began an intensive review of security for all members of Parliament, who  do not qualify for the 24-hour protection provided to British officials  residing in Northern Ireland.    The attack on Gow, which occurred in the driveway of his modest country home  Monday, was the 12th claimed by the IRA this year and the 17th since it  launched its current round of violence last September.    Earlier casualties have included police officers, soldiers and a Roman Catholic  nun.    Two men were charged Friday with last week's murder in Northern Ireland of that  nun and three police officers in a land-mine explosion near the Irish border.  Henry McCartney, 26, and Tarlac Connolly, 29, both of Armagh, were ordered held  until Aug. 17.

Thatcher, in an interview with Britain's Independent Television Network,  indicated that the government already is providing as much security as it can.

It would be one  of the outlawed IRA's deadliest attacks on the main British island.    Nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast, which also damaged  dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away. The musicians were  between the ages of 16 and 20 as are most of the recruits in the school.    A police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with  certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb. But he said the  characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared  to confirm that it was the work of the IRA.    Security sources said they believe that at least two IRA ""active service""  units, each composed of four or five members, are operating in Britain and  continental Europe.    One member, known as the ""Jackal"" after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth  novel ""The Day of the Jackal,"" has been eluding the authorities for two years.  He has been identified as Patrick Sheehy and has been linked to the IRA's last  successful mainland bombing attack -- on an army barracks at Mill Hill in  August, 1988. One soldier was killed in that incident.    Sheehy and another wanted Irishman, John Conaghty, were linked to an IRA bomb  factory in North London that the police stumbled upon last December while in  pursuit of a car thief. A search turned up automatic and semiautomatic weapons,  ammunition, 150 pounds of Semtex high explosive and a ""hit list"" of 100 British  political figures and other officials headed by Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher.    Friday's explosion occurred about 8:30 a.m. in a lounge at the Royal Marines  School of Music near Deal, on the English Channel in the county of Kent. At the  school are about 250 recruits who receive military and musical training before  joining Royal Marines bands.    The roof of the three-story barracks collapsed, trapping victims beneath the  rubble. Firefighters used thermal cameras and dogs to search the debris for  victims and survivors. Heavy lifting gear was brought to the scene from a  nearby site where a tunnel is being built beneath the English Channel.    Rescuers shouted for quiet as they used high-technology listening equipment in  an effort to trace the sound of faint heartbeats.

She said  she told her children to run for cover, but as they did, her kitchen window  shattered.    ""The whole window was blown across the kitchen,"" Hackett recalled. Her  2-year-old son, Joshua, was hit by a shard that embedded itself in his back but  caused no serious injury.    ""I just screamed and ran out of the room,"" she said. ""The bang was so loud I  thought the whole house was coming in.""

The authorities have been on high alert, expecting IRA attacks in connection  with last month's 20th anniversary of the introduction of British troops into  Northern Ireland.

It is widely hated by the Catholic minority in the province, and the Irish  government in Dublin has urged Britain to disband the force.

Eight persons were killed by IRA car bombs outside Harrods department store  here in December, 1983, and 21 were killed and 162 injured in two Birmingham  public house bombings in the fall of 1974.

Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai, Mr Yeltsin's chief legal adviser, said during that time a special commission could sort out disagreements over elements of a new constitution. Mr Yeltsin had initially instructed the convention to finish work on his draft constitution by next Wednesday. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker who wants to delay the adoption of a new constitution for as long as possible, engaged in some familiar spoiling tactics yesterday. Claiming he was too ill to attend the convention at which he was supposed to speak yesterday, he announced plans to set up his own rival convention. Meanwhile, the government continued to combine radical economic action with old-style bureaucratic methods. At a cabinet meeting yesterday ministries were given a week to come up with plans for a 20 per cent cut in expenditure. The cabinet also created an inner group of ministers to deal with urgent economic reforms, to be headed by Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, and including the government's three young radical deputy prime ministers. One of the duties of the commission, which excludes Mr Oleg Lobov, the conservative economics minister, is to implement an industrial policy, the details of which have yet to be finalised. Appearing weary, Mr Soskovets, who is formally responsible for industry, stressed the importance of rebuilding economic ties with other former Soviet republics. Moscow police have arrested several officials in charge of the Russian central bank's notoriously inefficient clearing system for alleged involvement in the diversion of central bank funds on the basis of forged transfer documents. An investigator in charge of the case said it was too early to release details but that the arrests went as high as managerial level. A spokesman for the central bank said that the arrests were confined to the separately-managed payments system and did not affect management of the central bank itself.

The detention of Mr Mohammed Sharif is the latest development in the bitter battle between Ms Bhutto and Mr Nawaz Sharif which has overshadowed politics for five years. The move came on the eve of a joint session of parliament, the first since she took power last year, at which President Farooq Leghari is to make a key speech. Mr Nawaz Sharif's supporters last night promised to engulf the meeting with protests. The Federation of Pakistani Chambers of Commerce and Industry warned of 'a severe reaction' from businessmen unless his father was released. Mr Mohammed Sharif was arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency, which alleged tax evasion of income of about Rs100m (Pounds 2m). The agency also charged, but did not arrest, Mr Nawaz Sharif's two brothers, Mr Abbas Sharif and Mr Shahbaz Sharif, and his son, Mr Hussain Nawaz Sharif. Mr Mohammed Sharif, a self-made industrialist, is regarded as the architect of Mr Nawaz Sharif's rise to power. His arrest follows a sustained attack on the family business empire by the Bhutto government, which has ordered tax and fraud investigations by the Federal Anti-Corruption Committee and the Federal Investigation Agency. Mr Nawaz Sharif yesterday denied the tax fraud charges: 'The regime is totally rattled and in panic on the eve of the joint session of parliament.' The arrests come amid factional violence in Karachi, the commercial capital, where about 20 people have died since last Thursday, and an armed uprising by tribesmen in the north. The government at the weekend also suffered a serious foreign policy defeat when it failed to secure the support of other Islamic states for a motion on the troubled region of Kashmir at the United Nations General Assembly. The State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank, at the weekend cut the maximum bank lending rate from 19 per cent to 17.5 per cent, to promote investment and economic growth.

Hossein Shahriarifar, 26, however, allegedly implicated two  other Iranians arrested with him in the southern tourist town of  Hat Yai on Friday as taking part in falsifying passports, Pol  Lt-Gen Chaisit said.    Shahriarifar and another Iranian suspect, Mohammadi  Lotfollar, who is still at large, were sought under arrest  warrants issued by the police last week on charges of conspiring  to commit premeditated murder, robbery resulting in the death of  others, and making and possessing explosives.    The warrants were issued after the police said they had  evidence to prove the two were behind a plot to car-bomb the  embassy.    The bombing plan ran into trouble when the bomb-laden  six-wheel truck allegedly driven by Hossein accidentally hit a  motorcycle-taxi near Central Chitlom department store a short  distance from the embassy.    After failing to negotiate with the motorcycle driver, the  truck driver, said to be an Arab-looking man, fled the scene.    The truck from a rental company was then taken to Lumphini  police station where it was left for about a week before its  owner found a water tank containing C-4 plastic explosives wired  to a diesel fuel tank.    The body of Chom Thila, a Thai employee of the rental firm,  was found in the tank.    Nine witnesses yesterday identified Hossein, detained at the  Metropolitan Police Private School in Bang Khen, as the truck  driver, according to Pol Lt Gen Chaisit.    Shahriarifar and his two Iranian friends, Babak Taheri and  Basr Kazemi, were caught early Friday morning at the Inthra  Hotel in Hat Yai.    A source at an immigration office in Songkhla's Sadao  district said Shahriarifar held a valid passport issued by Iran  under the name Pajiri Mahmed and entered Thailand through the  immigration checkpoint on Thursday.    Since Shahriarifar's photo in the passport allegedly looked  similar to a sketch produced by Lumphini police station and  distributed to immigration offices across the country, an  immigration officer advised Hat Yai police to keep a close watch  on the man who checked-in at the hotel later on Thursday.    The source said Shahriarifar had entered and left Thailand  through the immigration checkpoints in Sadao and Su-ngai Kolok  districts more than 10 times under different names.    The immigration officers, however, earlier could not  identify  him because they did not have his photograph.    Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar, believed to have left  the country after his failure to allegedly bomb the embassy,  came back because he had fallen in love with a Thai woman in Hat  Yai.    The suspect also might have thought that the Thai police had  called off their investigation.    Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar did not implicate the  other suspect as being involved in the embassy bombing plot.    He said the police found the gang had its command centre in  Malaysia where one of its leading members had been caught by  Malaysian police on charges of falsifying documents.    The Metropolitan Police Bureau is looking for additional  witnesses and evidence against Shahriarifar in Bangkok and  southern provinces.    Investigations will be completed in seven days and the  suspect will then be charged in the Criminal Court, Pol Lt-Gen  Chaisit said.    Metropolitan Police Bureau deputy commissioner Sophon  Waratchanon dismissed concern that Shahriarifar might try to  kill himself, saying the suspect did not seem not under stress.    Neither the Iranian nor the Israeli embassies have contacted  the police since the arrest of Shahriarifar, he said.    Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said in Cha-am  yesterday that the car-bomb attempt was connected with some  ""Thai people in Bangkok"".    ""I thought there would be a lot more to come. Something  strange would happen,"" Gen Chawalit said. He did not elaborate.    He said the Interior Ministry had told the Iranian Embassy  that the Thai police were proceeding with the case.     "

Gates announced Tuesday.    The arrests were followed by an unrelated raid during which two men were taken  into custody and more than 200 marijuana plants were confiscated at what  investigators described as a sophisticated, hydroponic farming operation at a  luxury home in San Dimas, according to sheriff's deputies.    Gates said the suspects in the cocaine case were ""top-level people"" in the  distribution of drugs shipped into the Los Angeles area from overseas, probably  through Mexico. He said a major share of the cocaine confiscated probably had  been destined for transshipment to other cities across the United States.    Gates said the cocaine arrests late Monday ended a two-month investigation by  narcotics officers that began as the result of information received by  detectives. He did not explain how this information was received.    On Monday, the chief said, undercover officers followed Claudio Martinez, 26,  to a shopping center in Westminster in Orange County, where he met with Luis  Monsalve, 22, and Juan Casanova, 34. Officers said they moved in and arrested  the three, confiscating about 950 pounds of cocaine from a van driven by  Martinez.    After those arrests, Gates said, search warrants were issued for residences in  Burbank, Los Angeles, Pico Rivera, Westminster, Huntington Beach and Torrance.  The chief said another 220 pounds of cocaine was found at a home in  Westminster, and $102,895 in $5, $10, $20 and $50 bills was discovered at a  home in Torrance. Eight motor vehicles were impounded.    Flor Restrepo, 30, and her sister, Luz Restrepo, 33 -- described by Gates as  the leaders of the gang -- were arrested at an apartment in the Cahuenga Pass  area, along with Carlos Montoya, 32, and a 16-year-old girl.    Faber Restrepo, 26, was arrested at an apartment in Burbank and Olga Garcia,  32, was arrested at a home in Huntington Beach. Arolino Montoya, 37, was  arrested at an apartment in Pico Rivera and Janeth Garcia, 30, was arrested as  she drove away from her home in Westminster.      $1.5-Million Bail    All the suspects were booked on suspicion of possession of cocaine with intent  to sell. Bail for each was set at $1.5 million.    Gates said no further arrests were expected in the case.    Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said officers from the state Bureau of  Narcotics, the federal Drug Enforcement Adminstration and a task force of 11  San Gabriel Valley police agencies joined deputies Tuesday morning to raid the  $2-million hilltop home in San Dimas where the marijuana was being grown  without soil in tanks containing nutrient-enriched water.    Ducoulombier said that, in addition to the marijuana plants, some of which were  5 to 6 feet tall, officers confiscated $350,000 in cash and more than 60  pistols, rifles and shotguns.    Rollin Scott Forteville, 38, and Jeff Jenkins, 26, were arrested at the home  and booked on suspicion of marijuana cultivation. Bail for each was set at $1  million.    The cocaine seizure by Los Angeles police apparently was the sixth largest by  the department or the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.      Record Cocaine Seizure    In August, 1987, Los Angeles police confiscated 2,135 pounds of the drug at two  locations in the San Fernando Valley in what is believed to be the record drug  bust in the area.

About 1,800 pounds of the drug was seized in Anaheim by Los Angeles police in  April, 1986, and 1,760 pounds of cocaine was confiscated by Los Angeles County  sheriff's deputies in a home in Maywood in November, 1987.

The charge against Mohammed Salameh, 26, was made at a Manhattan district court. Earlier officials said he was of Middle East origin, but his citizenship was not disclosed. The authorities indicated that other suspects were being sought. At a news conference in Washington the acting US attorney general, Mr Stuart Gerson, said: 'We're interested in more than the single individual who has been apprehended.' Earlier, authorities said they had identified a van rented from Jersey City, New Jersey, as the possible vehicle used in the attack. Although the van was blown up, authorities were able to trace it through a number on the chassis. Police said that a man had rented a van in Jersey City and reported it stolen on the day of the blast. He was arrested when he went to get his deposit back from the rental company. Unconfirmed television reports said the arrested man was a member of a Moslem fundamentalist group with links to a mosque in New Jersey. The reports said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was executing search warrants in New Jersey and Brooklyn. New York TV station WNBC said the suspect was connected with a Moslem group linked to the killing of Meir Kahane, a radical rabbi who was assassinated in New York in 1990. However, the FBI and New York police refused to comment. Last Friday's explosion at the complex killed five people and injured more than 1,000. More than 50 phone calls were received by the authorities from persons or groups claiming to have carried it out. Speculation has ranged from Middle East Arab groups to factions embroiled in the Bosnian conflict. However, Mr Gerson refused to comment on all such reports: 'We are most concerned about a thorough, complete investigation,' he said. The cost of lost business has been put at Dollars 800m (Pounds 550m) in the first week alone.

Mr Rowland said Lonrho had set up a Caribbean shell company to finance a film about the bombing to establish whether Libya was involved in the destruction of the Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, with the loss of 270 lives. 'The Libyans want to sign deals with Lonrho worth hundreds of millions of pounds but I have to be sure we are not involved with partners of mass murder,' he said. 'If the film proves them to be innocent, there will be enormous potential to sign many deals.' Mr Rowland said Libya wanted to take a 25 per cent stake in Lonrho's agricultural business and recently pressed the company to sign new joint ventures worth around Pounds 150m through the Libyan Arab Finance Company (Lafico), the main investment vehicle of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. But Mr Rowland said: 'I have told them that until we know for sure that they were not involved in the Lockerbie bombing we cannot do any further deals.' Mr Rowland rebutted suggestions that his joint chief executive, Mr Dieter Bock, was not backing the film. 'Mr Bock has fully supported the board in deciding to make this film,' he said. Mr Bock, however, is known to be embarrassed by the film and wants Lonrho to withdraw from further co-operation with Libya. The film is being funded by Metropole Hotels which is two-thirds owned by Lonrho and one-third by Lafico. Mr Rowland said he had been warned by Mr Douglas Hogg, minister for foreign affairs, that screening of the film, due to be completed by January, could be in contempt of court. Mr Rowland said he had no intention of showing the film to the public but added that a copy would be sent to the foreign office once the documentary was finished. The issue is expected to be brought up at Lonrho's board meeting on Friday.   Companies:-  Lonrho.     Libyan Arab Finance.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     LYZ  Libya, Africa.

The Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang task force, dubbed Operation  Hammer, arrested 472 people in all -- 288 of them reputed gang members -- in a  crackdown that began Friday evening and continued into the early morning hours  Saturday, police said.    Hundreds of officers from police divisions in East Los Angeles, the Mid-City  area, the San Fernando Valley and other stations participated in the latest in  a series of periodic sweeps aimed at controlling street violence.    But despite those efforts, gang-related warfare still flared over the weekend.    Police reported that one apparent gang member was shot and killed Saturday  about 2:45 a.m. as he stood on a Pacoima sidewalk, less than an hour after the  task force had ceased operations for the day. The victim was reportedly hit in  the head by a bullet from a passing car and was pronounced dead at the scene.  No arrests had been made, Lt. Maurice Rubio of Foothill Division said.    At least six people were also wounded in gang-related shootings, including a  12-year-old boy who was shot in the back in the South-Central Los Angeles area.  He was left paralyzed from the waist down, police said.    The youth was walking in the 1200 block of East 41st Street just before  midnight Friday when he was shot by several gunmen in a passing car. ""They  yelled out their gang affiliation and fired several rounds at the youth walking  down the street,"" said Lt. Ron Code of the Newton Division who added that the  victim is in critical condition and that no arrests had been made.    A few hours later, in Hollywood, two officers on patrol witnessed another  drive-by shooting as three gunmen armed with shotguns opened fire on a rival  gang member in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant, police said.    The officers chased the speeding car on the Hollywood Freeway, and after  stopping it, they arrested four juveniles, said Sgt. C. E. Tave of Hollywood  Division. The unidentified victim was hit in the arm, buttocks and foot by  shotgun pellets but refused medical treatment, Tave said.

The Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang task force, dubbed Operation  Hammer, arrested 472 people in all -- 288 of them reputed gang members -- in a  crackdown that began Friday evening and continued into the early morning hours  Saturday, police said.    Hundreds of officers from police divisions in East Los Angeles, the Mid-City  area, the San Fernando Valley and other stations participated in the latest in  a series of periodic sweeps aimed at controlling street violence.    But despite those efforts, gang-related warfare still flared over the weekend.    Police reported that one apparent gang member was shot and killed Saturday  about 2:45 a.m. as he stood on a Pacoima sidewalk, less than an hour after the  task force had ceased operations for the day. The victim was reportedly hit in  the head by a bullet from a passing car and was pronounced dead at the scene.  No arrests had been made, Lt. Maurice Rubio of Foothill Division said.    At least six people were also wounded in gang-related shootings, including a  12-year-old boy who was shot in the back in the South-Central Los Angeles area.  He was left paralyzed from the waist down, police said.    The youth was walking in the 1200 block of East 41st Street just before  midnight Friday when he was shot by several gunmen in a passing car. ""They  yelled out their gang affiliation and fired several rounds at the youth walking  down the street,"" said Lt. Ron Code of the Newton Division who added that the  victim is in critical condition and that no arrests had been made.    A few hours later, in Hollywood, two officers on patrol witnessed another  drive-by shooting as three gunmen armed with shotguns opened fire on a rival  gang member in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant, police said.    The officers chased the speeding car on the Hollywood Freeway, and after  stopping it, they arrested four juveniles, said Sgt. C. E. Tave of Hollywood  Division. The unidentified victim was hit in the arm, buttocks and foot by  shotgun pellets but refused medical treatment, Tave said.

We protest resolutely against such an impertinent action  that  undermines the root of all efforts to resolve the crisis on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia in a peaceful way, the  statement emphasizes and then stresses:    The attack of NATO forces against the republic of Serbian  Krajina [as heard] further diminished the trust of the Serbian  people in the international community, which has been minimal  even so far due to its partisan and biased attitude in the past.  With such an act of aggression, the international community has  declared war on the Serbian people, and is, with the threat of  the NATO war machinery, trying to force it, in this way, to  embrace immediately the solutions that are in the interest of  the other two warring sides and to its detriment.    At the end of the statement issued in light of the NATO  attack on Serbian positions in the vicinity of Gorazde, RSK  President Milan Martic points out:    The people and the RSK leadership once again give their  unreserved support to our brothers in the Srpska republic in  their efforts to defend their country and their freedom, won  with blood. The responsibility for all possible consequences  that can, due to the bombing of the Srpska republic, further  (?undermine) the course of the peace process on the territories  of the former Yugoslavia will be borne by the perpetrators of  this hasty act.    At the same time, we warn the responsible international  factors that the RSK will not tolerate any attempts to resolve  its future political status through pressures, regardless of  where they might come from.    This is all from Knin for the time being -- a statement by  RSK President Milan Martic in light of the NATO attack.     "

The boisterous demonstration outside the Doctors' Family Planning facility in  the Santa Ana-Tustin Medical Pavilion was the first in Southern California  since the Supreme Court decided Monday that states can restrict abortions if  they choose.    Buoyed by the ruling, members of Operation Rescue, a militant anti-abortion  group, had hoped to block the entrances of the facility where abortions are  performed.      Opponents Were Waiting    But when anti-abortion demonstrators arrived early Saturday, they were met by  pro-choice activists who quickly locked arms and formed a wall of bodies  intended to shield patients and keep the facility open.    ""There were no arrests made because there were no complaints from the clinic,""  said Capt. Steve Foster of the Tustin Police Department. ""The clinic remained  open, and patients were being seen.""    Operation Rescue officials disputed that contention, and one woman who  identified herself as a clinic employee told anti-abortion demonstrators that a  number of appointments had been rescheduled Saturday and that no abortions were  performed.    But Judi Larson, executive director of the Doctors' Family Planning Medical  Group Inc., insisted that the majority of patients were seen as scheduled.  ""Several patients chose to terminate their pregnancies this morning, and that  was done,"" she said.    Overall, the Tustin demonstration was largely nonviolent, although tempers  flared and a few people reported minor injuries from shoving matches. Previous  demonstrations this year in Southern California resulted in hundreds of  arrests. Officers who arrived from several Orange County communities prepared  for an unruly crowd spent the day merely watching both sides wage a battle of  songs, chants, protest signs and prayers.    Afterward, each group declared it was the victor.    ""We feel that we accomplished our goals to rescue babies that were immediately  in danger,"" said Elaine Bingham, an Operation Rescue spokeswoman.      Councilman Attends    Councilman Earl J. Prescott, one of two Tustin City Council members who had  earlier expressed opposition to the clinic, praised the demonstrators for  choosing the clinic as a target. ""Thanks for coming to Tustin,"" he said. ""There  was no killing over there today.""    Pro-choice advocates were equally elated about the hours-long standoff.    ""I am absolutely thrilled,"" said Margie Seigle, executive director of Planned  Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties. ""I think we have stated that  Orange County is pro-choice and we will not tolerate the lawlessness of  Operation Rescue.""

And not only did we beat them, we beat  them with style.""      Latest Skirmish    The clash between the two groups was the latest in a series of skirmishes that  began in February when Operation Rescue first appeared in Southern California  to carry out part of its nationwide campaign to shut down abortion clinics. It  was also one of the most peaceful for a day that saw demonstrations scattered  nationwide from Brookline, Mass., to Denver.    No one was arrested in Brookline, but police reported 61 arrests in Chicago, 58  in Milwaukee, 50 in Denver, 41 in Dallas and 27 in Miami. Most of the arrests  involved people who attempted to block entrances to buildings where abortions  are performed.    Abortion clinics and police had braced themselves for another round of  demonstrations this weekend after the U. S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld a  Missouri law that forbids abortions in public hospitals and bans public  employees from assisting abortions in any way.    Although the justices did not overturn the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling  that legalized abortion, their ruling marked a departure from the court's  long-established practice of striking down nearly all state restrictions on  abortions.

Under this plan, arrests of major drug smugglers  around the country have started. This was announced by Maj. Gen.  (Retd.) Nasirullah Khan Babar, federal minister of drug control,  in a press conference here on Sunday. High officials of the  Narcotics Control Board were also present. The minister said  that arrests of the ""big fish"" in order to stop drug smuggling  have started. Three major smugglers, Umar Khan Parvez, Iqbal  Durrani, and Ghulam Mohammed, that were sought by the U.S.  Government have been arrested. He said that two new agencies  have been established to curb drugs. A policy review board has  been established under the leadership of the home minister. The  states home ministers, the four home secretaries, and health  ministers of the four states will be included in that board. In  addition a national committee to curb drugs is also established.  It will be chaired by the federal home secretary. The four  inspectors general of police, chief secretary of F.C. Rangers,  Coast Guard, and heads of other law and order agencies will be  members of this committee. He said that a major bill to give the  death penalty to drug smugglers and to confiscate their property  will be introduced in the National Assembly. The law ministry is  reviewing its draft. This will also be sent to state governments  for their input. He said that the government actions have  resulted in the reduction of the poppy growing areas from 80,000  acres to 15,000 acres. The production of poppy has come down  from 800 metric tons to 150 metric tons. He said that in Sarhad  there are only two places--Karo Darra and Naya Darra--where  poppy is still cultivated. The home minister said that the  Pakistan Government has sealed the Afghanistan border fully to  stop the entry of drugs from Afghanistan. It is expected that  the situation will improve now. A new program to stop drug  production in tribal areas has started. Under this program,  loans will be issued to tribals for starting industries. The  banking system is being amended for this purpose. In addition,  12 laboratories used for making heroin has been destroyed. While  discussing the government's activities, he said that the  government agencies have confiscated 398 kilograms of opium,  1,965 kilograms of heroin, 61,755 kilograms of hashish during  these 100 days. He said that a new comprehensive law, which will  be a composition of the three drug-related laws, will soon be  passed. The home minister said in answer to a question that the  CIA report [not further specified] has helped in arrests of some  major smugglers, and six of them have been handed over into U.S.  custody. While discussing Qazi Hussein Ahmed's accusation, the  home minister said that some drug smugglers were indeed present  in the former Assembly, however, no member in the present  Assembly has been identified as having relations with the Drug  Mafia. He said that when the investigation is completed, we will  learn which Assembly members have contacts with the Drug Mafia.  Action will be taken against whoever is found to be involved in  the drug trade. He said that it is very embarrassing for us that  every Friday two or three Pakistanis are beheaded in Saudi  Arabia. Screening machines are being placed in all airports to  investigate and make the system of personal search of all  Pakistanis going abroad more effective. In answer to a question,  the home minister said that the list of drug smugglers has been  given to the Senate committee and 15 of the smugglers have been  arrested. The remainder on the list will be arrested soon. While  talking informally with the reporters during lunch after the  press conference, Home Minister Maj. Gen. (Retd.) Nasirullah  Babar said that the federal government had decided to give the  right to vote to all adults in tribal areas. Under the new law,  FATA [Federally Administered Territories] will become totally a  part of Pakistan and all our national laws will be imposed  there. This will significantly reduce the number of crimes and a  new chapter of progress in the tribal area will be opened.     "

""Even if there is an external plot it is the duty of the  state to protect its citizens,"" said Samir Ja'ja' of the  disbanded Lebanese Forces, at a press conference at his  fortified home in Ghidras, north of the capital.    ""The Lebanese government is responsible for this crime,"" he  said, referring to Sunday's bomb attack in Our Lady of  Deliverance Church, in which 55 people were also injured.    ""The Lebanese people have been greatly deceived because they  have realised that the security the authorities promised to  restore is still a mirage,"" Ja'ja' added.    Information Minister Michel Samahah and several other  Lebanese officials blamed Israel for the bombing and linked the  blast to Friday's massacre of 52 Palestinian worshipers in  Hebron on the West Bank.    ""By blaming external factions these officials are trying to  cover up for their own impotence,"" Ja'ja' said, stressing that  the authorities had no tangible lead on which to base their  accusations.    Displaced Persons Minister Walid Junblatt said Monday he  feared a wave of attacks against places of worship in Lebanon by  supporters of partition backed by Israel.    The Druze leader, who heads the Progressive Socialist Party  (PSP), called for ""radical steps against those who undermine our  security.""    He rejected claims of a link between the church bombing and  the Hebron massacre, saying the theory was ""unconvincing"" and  Israeli agents were ""well known in Lebanon.""    Prosecutor Tarabay Rahmah said on Sunday that a suspect had  been arrested in connection with the blast, but he had been  seized days before it happened.    The blast was the second against Christian targets since a  December bomb attack on the right-wing Phalange Party  headquarters killed three people and wounded 100.    Relatives of the victims held a mass funeral in the church  on  Monday.    President Hafiz al-Asad of Syria, which has 35,000 troops in  Lebanon, pledged in a telephone call to his Lebanese counterpart  Ilyas al-Hirawi late Sunday to help track down the bombers.     "

Southern leaders, acknowledging the seriousness of the situation, repeated their appeals for international help to end the fighting. At dawn yesterday, hours after the UN issued its call for a ceasefire, northern forces fired two missiles at the city. One exploded over the Sheikh Othman district, wounding 20 worshippers at a mosque, while the other was brought down by southern anti-missile barrages, causing no injuries. Mr Abdul Rahman Ali Al-Jifri, vice-president of the breakaway south, condemned the attacks and appealed to the international community to bring more pressure on the north Yemeni leadership to stop the war. He acknowledged the south's position was serious and that the next 24-36 hours would be crucial in its fight against the north. Northern military units continued their ground advance on Aden, capturing the village of Sabir, about 8 miles from the outskirts of Aden. Other northern units, advancing eastward from Tur Al-Baha, were also reported to have arrived at Sabir and were poised for a final joint southward thrust to Aden. The sound of heavy explosions resounded through Aden as southern jets resumed bombing runs from the airport, attacking northern troops based at Zinjibar, about 45 miles east of Aden. Though bombed by northern jets nearly a month ago, Aden airport remains operational for military aircraft and has provided the backbone of the south's defence since hostilities began on April 27. Southern military officials said they still had air superiority over the north. The northern leadership has stepped up its drive against the south during the past week, aiming to achieve a military victory before international pressure can be brought to end the war. Apart from increased attacks on the military front, northern forces have also struck at civilian targets. Eight children were reported injured on Wednesday after a bombing raid on Aden by two northern jets aiming at an oil pipeline. The jets dropped Soviet-made bombs containing 30-40 smaller explosive canisters. Similar bombs loaded with nuts and bolts hit Aden a week ago, causing extensive civilian injuries, western observers said.   Countries:-  YEZ  Yemen, Middle East.

Yusuf Sha'ban, 29, who is accused of involvement in the  murder of a Jordanian diplomat, told a Beirut court he blew up  the Pan Am airliner which exploded over Scotland in December  1988 killing 270 people.    Sha'ban is a member of the Fatah Revolutionary Council, the  Palestinian terror organisation led by Abu-Nidal.    But yesterday a Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We have  stated many times we believe that there is a case to be answered  in a court in Scotland or the US involving two Libyans.""    Mr Jim Swire, a spokesman for British relatives of the  victims of flight 103, said the claim ""should be regarded with  grave suspicion.""    He added: ""It could be that he is seeking to attract what  terrorists might regard as kudos for the Abu-Nidal organisation.""    The belief that Libya is to blame for the bombing was  repeated by Mrs Stella Rimington, the director-general of MI5,  in the Dimbleby Lecture on Sunday [12 June]. Both Britain and  the United States are demanding that Libya hand over the two  suspects, 'Abd-al-Basit 'Ali al-Migrahi and Lamin Khalifah  Fuhaymah, for trial in either country.    The Abu-Nidal group has close links with Libya, but  officials  say it has not been identified with the Lockerbie atrocity. Nor  is the name of Sha'ban well known to the security sources.    Sha'ban claimed in court he had repeatedly told the  magistrate investigating the assassination that he was the  Lockerbie bomber but his claim had never been recorded.    Yesterday the likeliest explanation for his ""confession"" was  thought to be a desire to delay a possible death sentence in his  current trial. He and two others are charged with killing Na'ib  'Imran Ma'ayitah in Beirut in January.    Lebanon has recently begun carrying out the death penalty  for  murderers.    Another theory is that Sha'ban was acting on Abu-Nidal's  orders to try to divert attention from his patron Col  Al-Qadhdhafi, whose Libyan regime has suffered two years of  sanctions over his refusal to give up the suspects.

Yusuf Sha'ban, 29, made  the outburst in a Beirut courtroom where he is standing trial  accused of assassinating a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut in  January. ""I personally blew up the Lockerbie plane,"" Sha'ban, a  follower of terrorist chief Abu Nidal, told the court today.  ""I've told the investigating magistrate about it before, but my  confession wasn't documented. I say it again now,"" said  Sha'ban, of Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council.    If Sha'ban's claim is to be taken literally, it would appear  to question the Western case that the bombing was carried out by  two Libyans who have yet to surrender for trial in Scotland or  the United States. But British relatives' spokesman Dr. Jim  Swire said today that neither he nor others involved in the  tragedy had heard of Sha'ban before.    ""His claim should be regarded with grave suspicion,"" said  Dr.  Swire, whose daughter Flora was one of the 270 people killed  when a terrorist bomb brought down the PanAm jumbo jet over  Lockerbie.    ""It could be that he is seeking to attract what terrorists  might regard as kudos for the Abu Nidal organisation, for all I  know.""    Until a trial took place of the two Libyans, it was  impossible to say who was involved, said Dr. Swire. ""In the  absence of that trial, all claims deserve to be looked at -- but  they should equally be treated with grave suspicion.""    And the Foreign Office in London said: ""As we have said many  times in the past, we believe there is a case to be answered in  a court in Scotland or the United States by the two Libyans. If  anyone has further information which implicates anyone else,  this could be brought to the attention of the Lord Advocate in  Scotland or the U.S. authorities.""    In Scotland, a spokesman for the Crown Office said the Lord  Advocate had seen no evidence relating to ""the alleged  involvement"" of Sha'ban.    ""If anyone has any evidence relating to the case, they  should  make it available to the Dumfries and Galloway constabulary,""  the spokesman added.     "

A manpower shortage was cited as the reason in the audit by city administrators  and outside consultants.    The audit also concluded that the Police Department should eliminate two of its  four helicopters and consider transferring some of the officers from a special  neighborhood crime task force to other jobs.    According to the audit, officers did not meet the departmental goal of  responding within six minutes to crimes that are life-threatening or in  progress 48% of the time between July, 1987, and February, 1988.    The average delay was one second more than six minutes. Response times ranged  from 3 minutes, 16 seconds to 16 minutes, 26 seconds.    During the monitoring period, the department had about 56 officers on patrol  and was about 10 below the staffing level approved by the city.    ""What I don't understand is why can't we fill those positions?"" asked city  Director Kathryn Nack. ""We have the money, why don't we have the people?""    Police Chief James M. Robenson said the department has had a difficult time  finding officers.    He said it is difficult to find qualified candidates since only about one in 75  is accepted. Many potential applicants prefer to work on smaller suburban  forces, he said.    Pasadena has tried to solve the problem by recruiting on college campuses  around the country and setting up a toll-free telephone number to provide  employment information, Robenson said.    But Robenson said the audit was wrong in assuming the shortage has affected the  department's response time to emergency calls.    He said those calls are given top priority and even if a dozen new officers  were hired, it would not significantly lower response times. More patrol  officers, he said, would have a greater impact on less serious calls, which are  sometimes delayed while police respond to emergency calls.    Robenson also said the audit was misleading because it did not count the  response time of police helicopters, which he said can reach the scene of any  crime in the city in less than a minute.    He added that even if the audit were accurate, a delay of a few seconds was  still well within an acceptable range.    ""Sure I'd like to have the quickest response of any place, but we're talking  about just a few seconds,"" he said. ""If the trend is between six and seven  minutes, I feel we're delivering at least what we should.""    Police in Pomona, which is comparable to Pasadena in population, has an average  response time of 7 minutes, 50 seconds. Pomona has 94 patrol officers.    The audit, which will be presented to the Board of Directors Jan. 10, was part  of a series of reports commissioned by the city to study the operation of all  its major departments, such as water and power and public works.    The audit largely praised the Police Department for its responsiveness to the  community and innovative approach to law enforcement.    ""The Pasadena Police Department can be classified as an organization on the  move,"" the audit stated. ""Based on our analysis, the project team found no  major efficiency or effectiveness problems.""    Mayor William Thomson said he was pleased with the results of the audit, saying  it confirmed his belief that ""we have a first-rate department.""    But Director William Paparian said the audit's conclusions led him to believe  the department has gotten away from the basics of law enforcement to pursue  ""sexier"" and more high-profile projects.    ""We ought to be going to more substance than flash,"" he said. ""We've gone off  on these sexy approaches and I think it's time we get back to the basics.""    One example, Paparian said, was the Neighborhood Crime Task Force, a special  police unit formed to fight neighborhood crime and drug dealing, particularly  in northwest Pasadena.    The audit praised the task force for its high number of arrests and  convictions, but noted the number of felony and drug arrests have dropped.      Implications for Task Force    The audit team, which included city administrators and outside consultants,  said the smaller number of arrests for serious crimes may be the first sign the  3-year-old task force has outlived its usefulness.    The audit recommended the department consider transferring some of the task  force's 18 officers to other jobs.    But Robenson said cutting back the task force would be a ""disservice"" to the  northwest community, which still has the highest crime rate in the city.    While the number of felony and drug arrests did drop by about 20% during an  18-month period ending in 1987, the number of cases filed for prosecution  remained the same, the audit said.    Robenson said the task force allows the department to focus on combatting crime  in the neighborhoods by freeing up officers for foot patrols throughout the  city and undercover drug enforcement.      Helicopter Unit    The audit also raised concerns about the efficiency of the department's  helicopter unit, which auditors said has more helicopters than it needs.    The unit now has four helicopters, one of which is primarily used to ferry city  officials and demonstrate the capabilities of helicopters to police officers.  Other cities of comparable size have two helicopters to accomplish the same  work, according to the audit.    ""I don't know why we need to have our own air force with a budget of $1.1  million,"" Paparian said. ""I'd like to see us spend that money on  bread-and-butter stuff like more neighborhood patrols.""    The audit recommended selling two of the helicopters for an annual savings of  as much as $640,000.    But Robenson said to achieve those savings the department would have to  eliminate daytime flights and cut back flight time from 3,750 hours a year to  1,170.    He said the department is spending about the same as other departments that  have just two helicopters. For example, he said, Riverside police spent $1.3  million and Newport police spent $900,000 last year to operate two helicopters.    Robenson said having four helicopters is critical to the department's patrol  strategy because they can reach the scene of a crime faster than a patrol car  and can cover much more territory.

S. immigration law enacted in 1986 has thus far  failed to reverse the well-established pattern of illegal immigration from  Mexico and is unlikely to achieve lawmakers' stated goal of deterring  undocumented migrants, an academic study here has found.    Those conclusions, reached by a group of researchers directed by the Center for  U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego, contradict statements by U. S.  immigration authorities and congressional aides, who assert that the law is  working as designed.    The academicians, whose more than two-year study of the effects of the 1986 law  is among the most systematic such reviews done nationwide, reported this week  that Mexican migrants are continuing to flow northward, with or without  documentation, and that many illegal aliens are using bogus paper work to  secure jobs.      Jobs Still Available    Despite new legal sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens, the  study found that most Mexican migrants continue to find work in the United  States and that few are returning to Mexico, which is believed to account for  more than 90% of the illegal immigrants entering the United States.    ""The 1986 immigration law has not shut off the flow of new undocumented  immigrants from . . . Mexico,"" said Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center  for U.S.-Mexican Studies and head of the study. ""No viable alternative to  migrating to the United States has developed in these communities, so they're  continuing to send people.""    Moreover, Cornelius, one of the leading U. S. experts on Mexico and  immigration, said migrants are increasingly arriving from areas of Mexico  relatively new to the migrant stream, such as Mexico City and the states of  Mexico, Guerrero and Oaxaca. The development is an ominous one for U. S.  policy-makers seeking to deter illegal immigration, Cornelius said, as it  indicates that new migrant networks are being created at a time when  authorities would like to seal off arrivals from traditional migrant areas.    The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, the most comprehensive reform of  the nation's immigration laws in more than three decades, was designed largely  to reduce the flow of illegal aliens, mostly Mexicans, into the United States  via the U.S.-Mexico border.    Cornelius and others have argued that the law will likely be ineffective as  long as Mexico's economy continues to deteriorate.      Officials Disputed Results    INS and congressional officials disputed the results of the study, asserting  that the law was indeed deterring illegal immigration. Among other things,  authorities noted that arrests of illegal aliens along the U. S.-Mexico border  -- long considered the best single indicator of undocumented immigration --  have declined precipitously since passage of the new immigration law.    ""We feel we've pushed back the tide"" of illegal immigration, said Ron Rogers,  an INS spokesman in Los Angeles.    U. S. authorities have attributed the decline in arrests at the border in part  to the deterrent effect of the so-called ""employer sanction"" sections of the  new law. Those provisions require that all employers check prospective workers'  documentation to determine that they are authorized to work in the United  States.    The study found that a large number of Mexican illegal aliens -- 41% of those  with jobs who were interviewed by the academicians -- had resorted to using  false or borrowed immigration documents to secure work, thus circumventing the  law.    The decline in arrests at the border, Cornelius said, was more probably linked  to the fact that more than 3 million formerly illegal residents have been  granted legal status in the amnesty program and are now able to cross the  border legally.    Congressional aides with two U. S. senators active in immigration matters,  Republican Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and Democrat Edward M. Kennedy of  Massachusetts, characterized the results of the San Diego study as premature,  as it will take years to judge the new law's true effectiveness.    The San Diego study involved a series of stages, including interviews with more  than 300 Mexican immigrants, both documented and undocumented, working for 100  non-agricultural employers throughout Southern California and the San Francisco  Bay Area. Employers were also surveyed. It is estimated that half of all  Mexican immigrants to this country are bound for California.    Researchers also traveled to Mexico and spoke with residents from towns in  three states -- Michoacan, Jalisco and Zacatecas -- long identified with  immigration to California.

S.-Mexico border  -- long considered the best single indicator of undocumented immigration --  have declined precipitously since passage of the new immigration law.    ""We feel we've pushed back the tide"" of illegal immigration, said Ron Rogers,  an INS spokesman in Los Angeles.    U. S. authorities have attributed the decline in arrests at the border in part  to the deterrent effect of the so-called ""employer sanction"" sections of the  new law. Those provisions require that all employers check prospective workers'  documentation to determine that they are authorized to work in the United  States.    The study found that a large number of Mexican illegal aliens -- 41% of those  with jobs who were interviewed by the academicians -- had resorted to using  false or borrowed immigration documents to secure work, thus circumventing the  law.    The decline in arrests at the border, Cornelius said, was more probably linked  to the fact that more than 3 million formerly illegal residents have been  granted legal status in the amnesty program and are now able to cross the  border legally.    Congressional aides with two U. S. senators active in immigration matters,  Republican Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and Democrat Edward M. Kennedy of  Massachusetts, characterized the results of the San Diego study as premature,  as it will take years to judge the new law's true effectiveness.    The San Diego study involved a series of stages, including interviews with more  than 300 Mexican immigrants, both documented and undocumented, working for 100  non-agricultural employers throughout Southern California and the San Francisco  Bay Area. Employers were also surveyed. It is estimated that half of all  Mexican immigrants to this country are bound for California.    Researchers also traveled to Mexico and spoke with residents from towns in  three states -- Michoacan, Jalisco and Zacatecas -- long identified with  immigration to California.      Full Run    "

Among those apprehended, officials said Tuesday, was a 42-year-old suspected  smuggler, who authorities say may lead them to others involved in the  sophisticated smuggling operations.    Earlier Monday, 79 illegals, also bound for New York, were arrested at  Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport when the flight the smugglers were  using -- Eastern Airlines Flight 80 -- arrived there for refueling. Authorities  said the arrests resulted from tips in Atlanta and Los Angeles that coyotes, as  the smugglers are commonly called, had been using that flight to ferry  thousands of aliens across the country from Los Angeles.    Despite the arrest of Jorge Guzman-Romero on smuggling charges, Immigration and  Naturalization Service officials in Los Angeles conceded Tuesday that they were  not making much progress in capturing the masterminds behind the smuggling  aboard the Eastern flight.    ""We're not as close as we'd like to be,"" said Thomas Gaines, the local head of  the INS' anti-smuggling unit.    Gaines said he believes that the use of Flight 80 may involve many smugglers  who are not working together. ""We feel like we have a number of individual  smugglers who are utilizing a rather low air fare to move their aliens away  from the border from Los Angeles and on up to the East Coast,"" he said.    Donald Looney, assistant director of the INS Los Angeles district, said alien  smuggling aboard commercial jetliners is not new, noting that the practice has  been occurring ""as long as there's been airplanes.""    As in the Atlanta arrests, Eastern officials cooperated with the INS and the  airline is not involved in the smuggling, Looney said.    Gaines and Looney offered few details at a Los Angeles news conference about  specifics of how the scheme worked, the location of safe houses used by the  smugglers or when other arrests might be made, saying they do not want to  jeopardize the investigation.    However, based on interviews with the aliens captured at Los Angeles, INS  officials concluded that the smugglers have set up a system that transports  aliens from Mexico City to Tijuana and then across the border to San Diego.  There, a safe house was occasionally used for aliens waiting for the trip to  Los Angeles and Eastern Flight 80.    The aliens captured at the Los Angeles airport said they paid smugglers an  average of $800 for the trip to New York. Some of the aliens captured in  Atlanta said they had paid as much as $4,000 for a package deal, including air  fare, meals, housing and a job in the United States.    Of those arrested, 54 were from Mexico, seven from El Salvador, four from  Colombia and four from Guatemala. The Mexicans were bused to the border at San  Ysidro; the others were being held for probable deportation today.    An affidavit filed in support of Guzman-Romero's arrest said he accompanied  three Mexicans all the way from Mexico City. In one instance, Guzman-Romero  went to a small village in central Mexico and recruited a woman for the trip,  according to an affidavit by INS agent Anna Marie Morones.    Some aliens were told to pay more money once they arrived in New York and other  cities in the Northeast.    One veteran INS investigator, who asked that his name not be used, said Monday  night's apprehensions went smoothly.    ""After the arrests went down in Atlanta, it was easy enough for us to go the  next night to LAX, figure out where Flight 80 was boarding and round the people  up,"" the agent said.

The criticism came as authorities prepared to take legal  action against two newspapers for reports on the investigation  into the bombing of a Maronite Christian church and allegations  that a leading suspect was beaten up in custody.    Ten people were killed and 54 wounded when a bomb exploded  in  the Our Lady of Deliverance Church in Zuq Mika'il, north of  Beirut, on February 27.    ""In five days a party was dissolved, radios and televisions  were silenced and (now) they are after newspapers,"" said the  pro-Syrian AL-DIYAR daily on Monday.    ""Is the government of Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri trying  to transform the country into a big jail?,"" asked the daily's  political commentator.    Newspaper publisher and Lebanon's former ambassador to the  United Nations Ghassan Tuwayni blasted Information Minister  Michel Samahah describing him as a ""little Goebbels.""    ""We fear the country will become a third world dictatorship  with tribunals like those of the 1930s under Stalin,"" said  Tuwayni in a front-page editorial in his Arabic-language daily  AL-NAHAR.    Tuwayni, who up until now supported al-Hariri's government,  called for a cabinet reshuffle.    Authorities last week charged that seven out of nine  suspects  in the bombing were members of the disbanded Christian Lebanese  Forces militia.    The group, which became a political party in 1991, was  outlawed after its deputy leader Fu'ad Malik, was arrested as  part of the inquiry.    The cabinet also banned private radio and television  stations  from broadcasting news and political programs from midnight  Wednesday until parliament approved legislation to regulate the  media. The ban restricted news coverage to the state-run Tele  Liban and Radio Liban.    The state-run National News Agency (ANI) said the state  prosecutor would take action Monday against AL-DIYAR over a  report alleging that Malik was beaten while under arrest.    Action would also be taken against the pro-Syrian newspaper  AL- SAFIR which alleged the Israeli Shin Beth internal security  service had ""planned the attack on the church,"" according to ANI.    ANI said legal officials had ""warned against any violation  of  the secrecy surrounding the investigation and maintain they will  take action against anyone publishing information without  official proof.""

The Narcotics Bureau says the local drug market is now  choked  with heroin that is about 35 percent pure. Last month alone,  police confiscated 128 kilograms of the drug. The total amount  for 1993 was 223 kilograms.    The increase was indicative of a continuing flood of heroin  into the territory and more intensive police operations. Last  month, police recovered 96 blocks of heroin worth $50 million  from the seabed near Lamma Island. The 67-kilogram haul was the  biggest for two years. Despite a month-long nautical  surveillance operation no arrests have been made.    In early March, 33 kilograms of heroin were discovered in a  hut at Yuen Long.    There has also been an increase in the prevalence of the  drug  ""ice,"" a synthetic crystalline methamphetamine.    So far this year, 22 kilograms of ""ice"" has been seized,  more  than the total taken by police in the past two years. Last  year, drug-related arrests rose by 44 percent to 9,246. Deaths  linked to the abuse of narcotics jumped by 34 percent to 92.    Narcotics Bureau chief staff officer, Acting Chief  Superintendent Iain Grant, said the extra drugs seized did not  give police any reason for complacency. ""Obviously, if one  measures success by seizures and arrests, then we can say both  figures are up,"" Mr Grant said. ""But the other side is that  there appear to be more drugs on the streets.

Mr Grant said police intelligence suggested Hong Kong was no  longer as popular a transit centre for drug deals but many  transactions were still locally brokered or financed. He said  he was particularly pleased with recent police efforts to  destroy drug-cutting centres where pure heroin is diluted for  extra profits and ease of consumption by addicts. In 1993, 30  such facilities were located and shut down. This year seven  have been identified.     "

The Narcotics Bureau says the local drug market is now  choked  with heroin that is about 35 percent pure. Last month alone,  police confiscated 128 kilograms of the drug. The total amount  for 1993 was 223 kilograms.    The increase was indicative of a continuing flood of heroin  into the territory and more intensive police operations. Last  month, police recovered 96 blocks of heroin worth $50 million  from the seabed near Lamma Island. The 67-kilogram haul was the  biggest for two years. Despite a month-long nautical  surveillance operation no arrests have been made.    In early March, 33 kilograms of heroin were discovered in a  hut at Yuen Long.    There has also been an increase in the prevalence of the  drug  ""ice,"" a synthetic crystalline methamphetamine.    So far this year, 22 kilograms of ""ice"" has been seized,  more  than the total taken by police in the past two years. Last  year, drug-related arrests rose by 44 percent to 9,246. Deaths  linked to the abuse of narcotics jumped by 34 percent to 92.    Narcotics Bureau chief staff officer, Acting Chief  Superintendent Iain Grant, said the extra drugs seized did not  give police any reason for complacency.

Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, the UN undersecretary general for political affairs, was later assailed in his hotel by the demonstrators, who were dispersed by riot police firing tear gas. The Tripoli demonstrations hardly augured well for renewed attempts by Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo last night to find a compromise to Libya's increasingly bitter dispute with the world community. The special committee of seven ministers from Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Syria, Libya, Mauritania and Morocco was formed several weeks ago to defuse the Libyan crisis, but it has been ineffectual. Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, told reporters after a morning's informal talks on the Libyan affair there were 'many proposals' on the table, but he would not go into details. Privately League officials are pessimistic about their latest mediation efforts. 'The aim of the committee is to contain the situation, confirm the Arab position opposing terrorism, solve the problem in the framework of international sovereignty and provide a solution which all parties will agree to,' Mr Moussa added. One proposal is for Libya to hand over the two men to the Arab League which would act as a conduit for their eventual surrender to the British or US authorities for trial. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, would also be involved in facilitating such a transfer. But in Tripoli at the weekend, Libya's Colonel Muammer Gadaffi was adamant that unless the men voluntarily gave themselves up, he would not hand them over. Libya would never surrender its 'sons', he declared. Security Council Resolution 748, agreed last week, imposes an air and arms embargo against Libya from April 15 if it continues to block attempts to extradite its nationals suspected of downing Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland. The Council is also demanding that Libya make available for questioning to the French authorities four Libyans, including Col Gadaffi's brother-in-law, in connection with the bombing of a French UTA aircraft over Niger with loss of all 171 passengers and crew.

Northern forces were reported to have taken the town of al-Hawtah, 21 miles north of Aden, and then to have advanced at least four miles further south. Battles were also raging on other fronts near Aden. Forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh launched two missiles against the port city at dawn. One exploded over the Sheikh Othman district, wounding 20 worshippers at a mosque. The north's carefully worded acceptance of the UN ceasefire call appeared to be a gesture to world and particularly Arab opinion. But the Sanaa-based government did not specifically say it would stop fighting. Mr Abdul Rahman Ali Al-Jifri, vice-president of the breakaway south, earlier condemned the northern missile attacks and appealed to the international community to bring more pressure on the North Yemeni leadership to stop the war. He acknowledged the south's position was serious and that the next 24-36 hours would be crucial in its fight against the north. The UN, meanwhile, named former Algerian foreign minister Lakhdar Brahimi as special envoy to try to end the fighting. The Security Council resolution on Wednesday called for an immediate ceasefire, an arms embargo on the warring parties and despatch of a UN fact-finding mission. The north had stepped up its drive against the south over the past week, trying to achieve a military victory before international pressure can be brought to end the war. The sound of heavy explosions resounded through Aden yesterday, as southern jets resumed bombing runs from the airport, attacking northern troops based at Zinjibar, about 45 miles east of Aden. Though bombed by northern jets nearly a month ago, Aden airport remains operational for military aircraft and has provided the backbone of the south's defence. Southern military officials said they still had air superiority over the north. Among civilian casualties, eight children were reported injured on Wednesday after a bombing raid on Aden by two northern jets aiming at an oil pipeline. The jets dropped Soviet-made bombs containing 30-40 smaller explosive canisters. Similar bombs loaded with nuts and bolts hit Aden a week ago, causing extensive civilian injuries, western observers said.   Countries:-  YEZ  Yemen, Middle East.

0," LA030589-0192   26893    March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 1; Foreign Desk      2180 words      PAN AM BOMBING;    UNRAVELING THE MYSTERY OF FLIGHT 103      LOCKERBIE, Scotland      To the ordinary eye, the tiny scrap of material recovered from the rolling  green hills near here looked like any other piece of charred metal.    But to bomb experts searching for clues in the downing of Pan American Flight  103 as it flew over Scotland from London to New York last Dec. 21, the pattern  of pitting and cratering on the metal suggested that it had been directly  exposed to a high-intensity explosion.    Investigators then pinned down -- they won't say exactly how, but their work  relies heavily on computers -- that the metal came from a radio-cassette player  that housed plastic explosives. Having determined that the cassette player had  been carried inside a piece of luggage, they are now trying to identify the  luggage and figure out who checked it onto Flight 103.    If they can, they will have completed an important step in fixing  responsibility for the deaths of the 259 people aboard the flight and 11  citizens of this peaceful Scottish market town, whose name comes from the  Celtic words for ""a place of strength.""    It is one of the great detective operations of the decade: the inch-by-inch  scouring of 845 square miles of the Scottish countryside by 11,000 police and  others for more than 10,000 fragments from the doomed aircraft; then the  sorting of the wreckage in ""Shed No. 3,"" part of a British army ammunition  depot 18 miles southeast of here.      Like Skeleton Dinosaur    Inside the shed, like paleontologists putting together the skeleton of a  dinosaur, workers wearing plastic gloves have inspected and catalogued 80% of  the plane.    In particular, by putting together shreds of twisted aluminum as small as 2  inches long, they have reconstructed much of the ""igloo,"" or portable baggage  container, that they believe had been loaded into the forward cargo hold and  contained the piece of luggage that carried the explosives-laden cassette  player.    Intelligence agencies are conducting a parallel inquiry. The prime suspects are  no longer radical Palestinians seeking to abort the U.S. dialogue with the  Palestine Liberation Organization, but instead pro-Iranian groups with a  variety of possible motives, including retribution for the downing of an  Iranian Airbus by a U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf last July.    But the fact-gathering detectives in Scotland, fearful that preconceptions will  color their inquiry, have not even satisfied themselves beyond a shadow of a  doubt that the crime was a terrorist act.    ""Any investigator has his or her favorite suspect,"" said Neil Gallagher, chief  of the FBI's counterterrorist unit. ""It's critical that they do not allow the  investigation to be controlled by that.""    Gallagher acknowledges that the determination that the radio-cassette player  carried the explosive heightens the likelihood that terrorists brought down  Flight 103.    The bombing was apparently carried out by ""motivated, highly trained""  individuals and was not ""a sporadic act,"" he said. ""But that doesn't make it a  terrorist act.""    Gallagher and others involved in the probe here and in Washington seem  confident that those responsible for the act will be identified -- eventually.    ""Every day there's a new twist, a new development,"" Gallagher said, ""which  makes me confident a solution will be found. We're in no sense of the word  stymied. Whether we get to court remains to be seen.""      64 Airliner Cases    The record on solving such crimes, however, casts some doubt on Gallagher's  optimism. Since 1968, there have been 64 cases of sabotage, bombing or  attempted bombing of aircraft worldwide, according to Karen Gardela, a RAND  Corp. research assistant. The vast majority have gone unresolved, she said,  particularly when the plane was destroyed.    Flight 103 seems a special case. More than two months after the plane was blown  out of the sky, many roofs of Lockerbie houses remain covered by tarpaulins.  Others show the telltale new tiles replacing those that had been damaged by the  wreckage of the flight.    Sherwood Crescent, where the main part of the fuselage smashed to the earth in  a ball of fire, is still barricaded. Workmen have filled in most of the  30-foot-deep gash in the ground. Somewhere underneath lies whatever remains of  the missing bodies and four houses that were obliterated.    What will become of the crash site remains undetermined, although some  residents oppose any memorial that will perpetuate the place as a ghoulish  curiosity.    The scope of the investigation constitutes a kind of memorial to the tragedy.  John Boyd, chief constable for the Dumfries and Galloway Region, where  Lockerbie is located, described the probe as ""an international murder inquiry  on an unprecedented scale.""      Bodies on Golf Course    During what Boyd calls Phase 1 of the investigation -- the search for bodies --  victims were discovered over a 10-mile radius around Lockerbie. Scores of  bodies fell on a golf course near Mount Tilla, a hill behind the town.    Mountain rescue teams used dogs to search for bodies in the areas of heaviest  forestation and undergrowth. Police frogmen combed a huge reservoir a few miles  from the town, as well as smaller streams.    Despite the intense hunt, no trace has been found of six Americans, three  Hungarians and one Canadian from the plane and seven Lockerbie residents. Their  bodies, it is assumed, were virtually ""vaporized,"" as one source close to the  investigation put it.    As bodies were found, eight civilian and Royal Air Force pathologists worked to  identify them, helped by orthodontists, dental records and FBI fingerprint  cards. In the grisly cases of two victims, Karen Lee Hunt, 21, of Rochester,  N.Y., and Mary L. Johnson, 25, of Wayland, Mass., their bodies were  misidentified in Lockerbie and sent to each other's family.    Their ages and general physical description were close, and their dental charts  were virtually identical. ""I've seen them, and they had the same fillings in  the same teeth,"" said one source. The mistake was discovered after the Hunt  family became suspicious because the clothing from the body they received was  not anything they knew to be in their daughter's wardrobe.      Belongings X-Rayed    Examination of personal belongings began with X-rays ""in case of there being a  secondary explosive device,"" Boyd said. After personal property is conclusively  identified and determined to be unconnected with the bombing -- jewelry found  with the bodies of people not suspected of any connection with the bombing, for  instance -- it is being returned to relatives.    Some property from the crash is considered a health risk. Police Supt. Douglas  Roxburgh, who is in charge of the former chemical factory in Lockerbie where  investigators are storing and examining personal effects, said the material has  been exposed to a host of dangerous substances, including aviation fuel and  human body fluids.    ""Area contaminated!"" warn several signs at the former factory site. Inside, two  men, wearing white gowns and caps, surgical masks over their faces and rubber  gloves on their hands, sort through pieces of clothing.    Next came Phase 2: examination of the wreckage. Investigators faced the massive  task of finding and identifying fragments not only from the wide-bodied Boeing  747 itself but also from the 21 tons of cargo -- luggage and mail -- that took  off with the plane from London.    At Shed No. 3, a three-acre warehouse more than 200 yards long, each piece of  wreckage is carefully logged on a computer. Then the pieces are grouped --  wreckage from the cockpit goes to one corner of the shed, fragments from the  tail section go to another, and so forth.    From the physical evidence on the ground -- perhaps powder burns on luggage or  luggage compartments -- investigators determined that the bomb had been carried  in the forward baggage compartment.    For each piece of luggage, Gallagher said, investigators sought to determine  whether it had been on the first leg of Flight 103, a Boeing 727 from Frankfurt  to London, and then been transferred onto the 747 in London. Or had it joined  up with Flight 103 in London?    Next of kin were interviewed both to draw passenger profiles and to describe  what they knew about the luggage on Flight 103. Gallagher said agents asked for  such details as where passengers had been before boarding the plane, why they  were traveling, with whom they were traveling and whether they could have  carried the bomb onto the plane, wittingly or unwittingly.    ""More than 20"" of the 259 victims, mostly foreign men between the ages of 25  and 40, still have not been cleared of suspicion.      Pivotal Moment    Investigators are now focusing on matching the radio-cassette player with the  luggage that contained it. ""This is the most pivotal part of the  investigation,"" one official said.    A conclusive answer would eliminate the time-consuming task of reassembling  each piece of luggage.    One source indicated Friday that investigators had narrowed the possibilities  to a single piece of luggage. Others said only that several shreds of baggage  that had been in direct contact with the bomb had been recovered and  identified, but that the hunt for the specific bag was still under way.    Investigators have indicated that, from the remains they have recovered of the  explosive device, it was detonated by a combination timer and  altitude-sensitive trigger.    If the bomb was boarded onto Flight 103 in Frankfurt, then a strictly  altitude-sensitive bomb might have been detonated in the pressure chamber that  luggage passes through at the Frankfurt airport. And if the bomb had survived  the pressure chamber, it might have gone off in the Boeing 727 during the  flight to London.      Transfer Investigated    But an altitude-sensitive bomb with a timer -- a bomb set to explode, for  example, after two hours above 10,000 feet -- could have been loaded onto the  727 in Frankfurt but lain dormant until Flight 103 was 31,000 feet over the  Scottish countryside.    Investigators have not ruled out the possibility that the bomb was transferred  to Flight 103 in Frankfurt or London from another carrier, possibly a Middle  East airline, that subjected its baggage to less stringent security than Pan  Am.    For all the meticulous legwork, investigators acknowledge that they still have  a long way to go to answer the ultimate question. Said one: ""There is still not  a single piece of paper or evidence that says whodunnit.""    The radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a  group with close ties to Syria, has been mentioned repeatedly in speculation in  the press over suspects. Thirteen of its members were arrested in West Germany  in October with a Toshiba cassette player equipped with a plastic explosive  bomb and a detonator that would go off after a period of time at high altitude.    However, U.S. intelligence agencies have swung from early suspicion of radical  Palestinians to Iranian factions or pro-Iranian Lebanese as the main operatives  behind the bombing of Flight 103. Like a growing number of terrorist incidents  in the 1980s, Bush Administration officials say, the Pan Am bombing may have  involved operatives from multiple organizations.    Most of the analysis so far has been deductive rather than based on the  evidence. The focus on radical Palestinians, such as the PFLP-General Command,  has diminished simply because of timing.    The PFLP was originally suspected because of an obvious motive: to sabotage the  new U.S. dialogue with PLO chief Yasser Arafat. But Flight 103 was downed less  than two weeks after Arafat's dramatic announcement that he had accepted U.S.  conditions for talks. ""The bombing had to already have been in the planning  stage then,"" said a Bush Administration source who asked not to be named.    Iran and its allies are now considered to be among the prime suspects,  counterterrorism sources say. Not only might they have sought revenge for the  downing of an Iran Air jetliner by the U.S. Navy last July in which 290 people  were killed, but they also might have been trying to sabotage the efforts by  moderate Iranian factions to create an opening to the West.    And the mass suicide bomb has been a terrorist technique popularized by Iran  over the last six years.    Bush Administration sources are increasingly talking of ""state sponsorship.""  But while investigators express confidence that they will uncover the identity  of the bombers, several concede that they may not find sufficient proof to seek  a criminal indictment.    Sgt. David Audley of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, a past director  of the International Assn. of Bomb Technicians and Investigators, speaks for  experts who believe those responsible will eventually be identified.    ""A lot of people think that when a bomb goes off and detonates, the evidence is  vaporized and no one will ever find the pieces,"" he said. ""That's not true.  It's just like someone standing on a city street and firing a gun in the air.  Somewhere, someplace, the bullet is going down.""

More than two months after the plane was blown  out of the sky, many roofs of Lockerbie houses remain covered by tarpaulins.  Others show the telltale new tiles replacing those that had been damaged by the  wreckage of the flight.    Sherwood Crescent, where the main part of the fuselage smashed to the earth in  a ball of fire, is still barricaded. Workmen have filled in most of the  30-foot-deep gash in the ground. Somewhere underneath lies whatever remains of  the missing bodies and four houses that were obliterated.    What will become of the crash site remains undetermined, although some  residents oppose any memorial that will perpetuate the place as a ghoulish  curiosity.    The scope of the investigation constitutes a kind of memorial to the tragedy.  John Boyd, chief constable for the Dumfries and Galloway Region, where  Lockerbie is located, described the probe as ""an international murder inquiry  on an unprecedented scale.""      Bodies on Golf Course    During what Boyd calls Phase 1 of the investigation -- the search for bodies --  victims were discovered over a 10-mile radius around Lockerbie. Scores of  bodies fell on a golf course near Mount Tilla, a hill behind the town.    Mountain rescue teams used dogs to search for bodies in the areas of heaviest  forestation and undergrowth. Police frogmen combed a huge reservoir a few miles  from the town, as well as smaller streams.    Despite the intense hunt, no trace has been found of six Americans, three  Hungarians and one Canadian from the plane and seven Lockerbie residents. Their  bodies, it is assumed, were virtually ""vaporized,"" as one source close to the  investigation put it.    As bodies were found, eight civilian and Royal Air Force pathologists worked to  identify them, helped by orthodontists, dental records and FBI fingerprint  cards. In the grisly cases of two victims, Karen Lee Hunt, 21, of Rochester,  N.Y., and Mary L. Johnson, 25, of Wayland, Mass., their bodies were  misidentified in Lockerbie and sent to each other's family.    Their ages and general physical description were close, and their dental charts  were virtually identical. ""I've seen them, and they had the same fillings in  the same teeth,"" said one source. The mistake was discovered after the Hunt  family became suspicious because the clothing from the body they received was  not anything they knew to be in their daughter's wardrobe.      Belongings X-Rayed    Examination of personal belongings began with X-rays ""in case of there being a  secondary explosive device,"" Boyd said. After personal property is conclusively  identified and determined to be unconnected with the bombing -- jewelry found  with the bodies of people not suspected of any connection with the bombing, for  instance -- it is being returned to relatives.    Some property from the crash is considered a health risk. Police Supt. Douglas  Roxburgh, who is in charge of the former chemical factory in Lockerbie where  investigators are storing and examining personal effects, said the material has  been exposed to a host of dangerous substances, including aviation fuel and  human body fluids.    ""Area contaminated!"" warn several signs at the former factory site. Inside, two  men, wearing white gowns and caps, surgical masks over their faces and rubber  gloves on their hands, sort through pieces of clothing.    Next came Phase 2: examination of the wreckage. Investigators faced the massive  task of finding and identifying fragments not only from the wide-bodied Boeing  747 itself but also from the 21 tons of cargo -- luggage and mail -- that took  off with the plane from London.    At Shed No. 3, a three-acre warehouse more than 200 yards long, each piece of  wreckage is carefully logged on a computer. Then the pieces are grouped --  wreckage from the cockpit goes to one corner of the shed, fragments from the  tail section go to another, and so forth.    From the physical evidence on the ground -- perhaps powder burns on luggage or  luggage compartments -- investigators determined that the bomb had been carried  in the forward baggage compartment.    For each piece of luggage, Gallagher said, investigators sought to determine  whether it had been on the first leg of Flight 103, a Boeing 727 from Frankfurt  to London, and then been transferred onto the 747 in London. Or had it joined  up with Flight 103 in London?    Next of kin were interviewed both to draw passenger profiles and to describe  what they knew about the luggage on Flight 103. Gallagher said agents asked for  such details as where passengers had been before boarding the plane, why they  were traveling, with whom they were traveling and whether they could have  carried the bomb onto the plane, wittingly or unwittingly.    ""More than 20"" of the 259 victims, mostly foreign men between the ages of 25  and 40, still have not been cleared of suspicion.      Pivotal Moment    Investigators are now focusing on matching the radio-cassette player with the  luggage that contained it. ""This is the most pivotal part of the  investigation,"" one official said.    A conclusive answer would eliminate the time-consuming task of reassembling  each piece of luggage.    One source indicated Friday that investigators had narrowed the possibilities  to a single piece of luggage. Others said only that several shreds of baggage  that had been in direct contact with the bomb had been recovered and  identified, but that the hunt for the specific bag was still under way.    Investigators have indicated that, from the remains they have recovered of the  explosive device, it was detonated by a combination timer and  altitude-sensitive trigger.    If the bomb was boarded onto Flight 103 in Frankfurt, then a strictly  altitude-sensitive bomb might have been detonated in the pressure chamber that  luggage passes through at the Frankfurt airport. And if the bomb had survived  the pressure chamber, it might have gone off in the Boeing 727 during the  flight to London.      Transfer Investigated    But an altitude-sensitive bomb with a timer -- a bomb set to explode, for  example, after two hours above 10,000 feet -- could have been loaded onto the  727 in Frankfurt but lain dormant until Flight 103 was 31,000 feet over the  Scottish countryside.    Investigators have not ruled out the possibility that the bomb was transferred  to Flight 103 in Frankfurt or London from another carrier, possibly a Middle  East airline, that subjected its baggage to less stringent security than Pan  Am.    For all the meticulous legwork, investigators acknowledge that they still have  a long way to go to answer the ultimate question. Said one: ""There is still not  a single piece of paper or evidence that says whodunnit.""    The radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a  group with close ties to Syria, has been mentioned repeatedly in speculation in  the press over suspects. Thirteen of its members were arrested in West Germany  in October with a Toshiba cassette player equipped with a plastic explosive  bomb and a detonator that would go off after a period of time at high altitude.    However, U.S. intelligence agencies have swung from early suspicion of radical  Palestinians to Iranian factions or pro-Iranian Lebanese as the main operatives  behind the bombing of Flight 103. Like a growing number of terrorist incidents  in the 1980s, Bush Administration officials say, the Pan Am bombing may have  involved operatives from multiple organizations.    Most of the analysis so far has been deductive rather than based on the  evidence. The focus on radical Palestinians, such as the PFLP-General Command,  has diminished simply because of timing.    The PFLP was originally suspected because of an obvious motive: to sabotage the  new U.S. dialogue with PLO chief Yasser Arafat. But Flight 103 was downed less  than two weeks after Arafat's dramatic announcement that he had accepted U.S.  conditions for talks. ""The bombing had to already have been in the planning  stage then,"" said a Bush Administration source who asked not to be named.    Iran and its allies are now considered to be among the prime suspects,  counterterrorism sources say. Not only might they have sought revenge for the  downing of an Iran Air jetliner by the U.S. Navy last July in which 290 people  were killed, but they also might have been trying to sabotage the efforts by  moderate Iranian factions to create an opening to the West.    And the mass suicide bomb has been a terrorist technique popularized by Iran  over the last six years.    Bush Administration sources are increasingly talking of ""state sponsorship.""  But while investigators express confidence that they will uncover the identity  of the bombers, several concede that they may not find sufficient proof to seek  a criminal indictment.    Sgt. David Audley of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, a past director  of the International Assn. of Bomb Technicians and Investigators, speaks for  experts who believe those responsible will eventually be identified.    ""A lot of people think that when a bomb goes off and detonates, the evidence is  vaporized and no one will ever find the pieces,"" he said. ""That's not true.  It's just like someone standing on a city street and firing a gun in the air.  Somewhere, someplace, the bullet is going down.""

Yasir Shuraydi, 34, who was also on trial for murders and  other crimes committed in Lebanon, said he was not in West  Berlin when Mustafa al-'Ashiq, a former Libyan diplomat, was  gunned down in 1984.    The Palestinian worked at the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin  from 1982 until he left Germany in 1989 to return to Lebanon.  Under Lebanese law, he can also be tried for crimes committed  abroad.    He also denied any involvement in the April 5, 1986 bombing  of the La Belle discotheque in West Berlin frequented by US  troops. But Lebanese authorities have not charged him in  connection with that attack.    Three people were killed and 230 others wounded in the  bombing, which Washington blamed on Libya. Ten days later US  bombers blasted the headquarters of Libyan leader Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli.    Shuraydi said the Germans suspected him of involvement in  the  bombing because ""I am a Palestinian.""    He had tried to recruit volunteers in Germany in 1982 to  fight the Israeli Army which invaded Lebanon that year, he said.    Ghassan Ayyub, another Palestinian suspect in the murder of  al-'Ashiq, said he had never known the Libyan, stressing that he  had gone to Germany in 1984 seeking political asylum.    He fled Germany after the murder because a friend showed him  a newspaper report which linked him and Shuraydi with  al-'Ashiq's murder. The report was accompanied by photographs  of both Palestinians, he added.    After hearing the two men for about an hour the court  adjourned until April 19, when a verdict is expected to be  announced.    Germany has demanded Shuraydi's extradition but there is no  such agreement between Beirut and Bonn.    Under Lebanese law a foreigner living in Lebanon can be  tried  for a crime committed in this country or abroad and any  extradition measure can only be decided by the cabinet after a  verdict is pronounced.    Shuraydi, who along with Ayyub come from the 'Ayn al-Hulwah  Palestinian refugee camp on the eastern outskirts of the port  city of Sidon, was arrested by the Lebanese authorities in 1991  in connection with a string of murders, attempted murder and  burglaries.

To the  soldiers and sailors who bomb and assault its shores, the uninhabited island  offers a chance to practice war as it is really fought.    For more than a decade, Aluli has clung to the dream of stopping the bombing  and returning Kahoolawe (pronounced Kah-ho-oh-lah-vey) to Hawaii's people. In  1976, he and a band of friends took matters in their own hands, sailing across  the choppy channel from Maui to land on a rocky beach. The Navy promptly  arrested them for trespassing. But the protesters kept coming, even after two  were lost at sea.    Today Aluli's dream is closer than ever to reality. The National Security  Council, at the behest of President Bush, is assessing the feasibility of  ending use of Kahoolawe as a target. The Navy took over the island during World  War II.    ""The fact that we have the attention of the White House for the first time in  our efforts to stop the bombing is really a breakthrough,"" said Davianna  McGregor, a spokesman for Protect Kahoolawe Ohana, a nonprofit group. ""Ohana""  means ""family"" in Hawaiian.    At first blush, the 45-square-mile island seems unlikely to provoke such an  emotional tug of war. Kahoolawe's battered red dirt swells and cracks in the  sun. Scrubby mesquite trees provide scant shade. Goats have stripped its  once-productive ranch land, and erosion has slashed steep ravines in its sides.    But the smallest of the state's eight major islands has become a powerful  symbol for Hawaiians. What it lacks in foliage, Kahoolawe makes up for in  history. Ancient fishing shrines stud the coastline. At its summit, early  Hawaiians studied astronomy and navigation. The entire island is listed on the  National Register of Historic Places, so rich is it in archeological features.    ""It is a spiritual center that takes us back to our kupuna (elders),"" said  McGregor. ""It has helped the Hawaiian movement find its soul.""    Once dismissed as a radical cause, the push to reclaim Kahoolawe has gradually  moved into Hawaii's mainstream. When the early occupations proved fruitless,  Aluli sued the secretary of the Navy on environmental, historic and religious  grounds. The court decision was a milestone for the Ohana.    A 1980 consent decree gives Hawaiians access to the island 10 times a year for  religious and educational purposes. It limits the shelling to the central third  of the island, and requires the Navy to preserve historic sites, stem soil  erosion and help revegetate the island.    Over time, one political leader after another has joined the cause, some with  dramatic flourish. A few years ago, Maui Mayor Hannibal Tavares planted a flag  on the island to claim it for his jurisdiction, while a helicopter overhead  scattered thousands of carnations.    Under its visitation rights, the group has brought about 4,000 people to the  island. They arrive by boat and wade ashore through the surf, carrying  supplies.    While on the island, the group reverts to traditional ways. Ohana members have  built a house of wood and thatch that was brought to the island piece by piece.  They dive for fish and conduct religious ceremonies, offering leaf-wrapped  gifts of food to Hawaiian gods.    Navy personnel always hover nearby, keeping an eye out for unexploded shells  that often protrude from the ground. Troops conduct regular ordnance sweeps,  but more keeps turning up.    While the bombing has been a public relations disaster for the military, the  Navy is proud of its record in reforestation and protecting archeological  sites.

""There just aren't other places in Hawaii we can do this type of training,""  said Capt. Gerald Mittendorff, Kahoolawe project officer for the Navy. All four  branches of the military use the island, operating out of a base camp  overlooking its best sandy beach. Every other year, they invite Pacific allies  to join them for exercises.

A police investigation directed  against terrorist activity is under the personal control of the  prime minister. All materials from the investigation of the bomb  blast that occurred in front of the Kadrioru police department  are being turned over to the prime minister.    As is known, an explosion occurred the evening of November  14  in Tallinn in front of the Kadrioru police department, which  injured two policemen and demolished three police patrol cars.  On 28 October, a bomb exploded at 10:25 p.m. in front of the  same police department, which destroyed two police cars.    ""The explosions demonstrate that the Estonian police have  started to feel open to attack. Earlier there wasn't any thought  of bombing the police, but now evidently the need to intimidate  the police has arisen,"" explained Laar.    The fight against crime is one of the most important tasks  for 1994, assured the prime minister. ""It's reason to believe  that a merciless war with criminals has started,"" noted Laar.  The prime minister assured that the state would provide for its  police officers, who had suffered injuries in the attacks  against the police. In the words of the prime minister, the  families of these police officers would be cared for as well.    An allotment of Israeli purchased arms will go towards  replacing police weapons.    ""In connection with the bomb explosions of the Kadrioru  police department building, Tallinn Police Commissioner is doing  all that is possible in finding those responsible for this crime  and restoring law and security in the city,"" a representative  from the Tallinn Police Commissioner's Press Department told the  ETA.    The Tallinn criminal investigation department is currently  checking on several possible theories in a joint effort with  representatives of the Defense Police. In their operation, the  Commissioner's criminal investigators have discovered 8  kilograms illegally held explosives, weapons and detonators.  Twelve people have been arrested. Their involvement with the  bombing is being verified.    Tallinn police commissioner Ralf Palo added, that  considering  the extraordinary occurrence, a 5,000-10,000 kroon reward is  being offered to anyone who can inform the police of crucially  important facts in one's possession which can aid in the  investigation of the explosions. Anonymity is guaranteed.     "

0,FT943-2134 ,"FT943-2134 _AN-EIUDKABMFT 940921   FT  21 SEP 94 / Lonrho film sale probed by Bank      By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD   The Bank of England is investigating whether Lonrho breached United Nations sanctions by selling a film about the Lockerbie bombing to an Egyptian company with links to Libya. The outcome of the probe is likely to have an important influence on the battle between Lonrho's joint chief executives, Mr Dieter Bock and Mr Tiny Rowland. Mr Bock wants to depose Mr Rowland, who took a personal interest in both the making and disposal of the film. Three weeks ago Mr Bock's position in the company was weakened considerably when his fellow directors forced him to abandon a plan to propose at a board meeting that Mr Rowland should be stripped of his executive powers. He is likely to try to regain the initiative in the battle for power by arguing to the international trading group's board that Mr Rowland is responsible, if sanctions are found to have been breached. The investigation into the film sale is being carried out by the Bank of England's Sanctions Emergency Unit, whose role is to ensure that the financial aspects of UN sanctions are not breached by UK entities. Under the latest version of the sanctions, introduced on December 1 last year, UK companies are required to seek the Bank's permission before 'parting with . . . investments to . . . a Libyan person (a company or individual)'. The Bank's permission in this case was not sought. The nearly completed film argues that the Libyans were not responsible for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103. Its Pounds 632,948 budget was financed by Lonrho's Metropole subsidiary, which is a third owned by the Libyan Arab Finance Company. Earlier this year, after Mr Bock complained about Lonrho's involvement in the film, it was sold to a Cairo-based company, the Joint Arab International Investment Company, or Jaico, for Pounds 200,000. On April 7, Barclays Bank in Birmingham received Pounds 199,989 from the Cairo branch of Arab International Bank, Cairo. However, the signatory on the sale agreement on behalf of Jaico was Mr Mohamed El Huwej, who is chairman of Lafico, the main investment vehicle of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. Because of this apparent connection between Jaico and Lafico, Mr Rowland was formally requested by Mr Martin Bolland, Metropole's managing director, to obtain a written statement from Mr El Huwej on his relationship with Jaico.

As Clinton decided last year, China  will only keep the trade privilege if it makes clear progress in  respecting human rights. Secretary of State Christopher will  come to Beijing on Friday [11 March] to point that out. If the  U.S. President deprived the PRC of most-favored-nation status,  this would badly hurt the Chinese economy. More than one-third  of China's exports goes to the United States. The U.S. market  is so important for the Chinese that it has recently been  possible to wrest significant trade policy concessions from them.    On the issue of human rights, however, only a few  concessions  have been made. The latest arrests of prominent dissidents and  the new religious laws shortly before Christopher's visit and  the session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva have the  affect of a provocation. Beijing has rejected reproaches from  Western governments and accusations from human rights  organizations. It rejects a combination of trade and human  rights questions as interference in its internal affairs. The  Chinese Government refers to cultural differences and says that  other standards have to be applied in a developing country than  in industrial states. At the same time, it uses the attraction  of the big Chinese market to canvass for the most-favored-nation  status. If China is deprived of most-favored-nation status, the  U.S. economy will be hit more than that of China, Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji recently claimed in Japan.    The most important demands of the U.S. President are:  freedom  to leave the country and prevention of the export of goods  produced in prisons; access to political prisoners and  information on them; permitting foreign radio and television  programs in China; respect for Tibet's cultural and religious  heritage.    For the communist leadership it is a matter of national  ""image"" that one must not give in to U.S. pressure and tolerate  interference. Opinions on the extent of minor concessions  regarding human rights are divided. This conclusion can be  drawn from the present to-and-fro regarding arrests, releases,  statements, and denials. While party leaders who are prepared  for reforms are in favor of releasing selected dissidents and  other gestures of goodwill, the conservatives take action  against dissidents.    However, the behavior of the government can also be  explained  by domestic policy pressure. China is facing a change in  leadership. Judging from the latest pictures, old Deng Xiaoping  is no longer able to determine policies. One believes that his  days are numbered. In the critical transition period,  differences of opinion within the party are hushed up according  to the old-communist pattern to present a picture of unity to  the outside. At the same time, it is intended to prevent  opposition right from the start. In the party leadership, which  fears every political movement in China, however small it may  be, there is a general nervousness that goes beyond  parliamentary groups. The three arrested dissidents had planned  to send a petition to the National People's Congress in which  they advocated, above all, workers' rights. When they were  arrested, signatures for the petition were collected. So far, it  has not become known whether the arrests are only connected with  the petition or whether the three men whose arrests were  confirmed by the Chinese Government are also accused of other  things. The petition does not make any revolutionary demands.  The activists are saying that they are not doing anything that  violates Chinese laws.    However, the party leadership points out that in 1989 the  protests also started with open letters and a petition at the  time of the convention of the National People's Congress. One  month later, the students were demonstrating in the streets of  Beijing. It is unlikely that a political movement might  currently meet with such a response. However, the party does  not want to take any risk. Then considerations regarding  international repercussions of oppression recede into the  background.    Moreover, the Chinese Government doubts the U.S.  determination to really push through their conditions. China  knows that there is a strong economic lobby in the United States  that advocates the prolongation of most-favored-nation status.  The U.S. Government also gives different signals. While the  human rights commissioner discussed political oppression in  Beijing last week, an envoy of the U.S. Department of Commerce  tried at the same time to procure Chinese orders valued at  billions [currency not specified] for the U.S. economy.

SERRANO and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      SAN DIEGO      FBI Director William S. Sessions expressed new confidence Tuesday that federal  investigators will solve the March 10 bombing in La Jolla of the van being  driven by the wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III.    In June, Sessions had said there was less of a chance of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation solving the Rogers' van bombing than the bombing of Pan American  Flight 103 from London to New York. He indicated to reporters in Washington on  Tuesday that he now has changed his mind.    ""In connection with 103, I am confident we will in fact present the evidence  that will allow us to have the strongest possible case that could -- if a grand  jury chose to indict -- be presented in court,"" Sessions said at a news  conference.    ""As to the comparison between two different investigations (103 and the Rogers  van bombing,),"" he said, ""they both have their frustrations.""    But, he added, ""I am confident that we will end up solving them both.""    Sharon Rogers, the wife of the former commander of the guided-missile cruiser  Vincennes, narrowly escaped death when her van suddenly exploded at a busy La  Jolla intersection in March.    The FBI assumed jurisdiction in the case on the theory that the Rogers family  was the target of a terrorist attack in retribution for Will Rogers' mistaken  order in 1988 aboard the Vincennes to shoot down a civilian Iranian airbus over  the Persian Gulf.    Sessions did not elaborate on why he has renewed confidence that the case will  be solved. But he indicated that the FBI, which has recently investigated an  American citizen with an alleged personal grudge against Will Rogers, has never  completely ruled out terrorism as a motive.    ""We are continuing that investigation,"" he said of the Rogers bombing.    ""It is a matter of trying to be sure that it is a terrorist incident and was a  terrorist incident and that we follow through to be able to gain the evidence  that will allow us to present it to the United States attorney for presentation  to a grand jury.""    His comments came as FBI agents continue to pursue leads involving George  Marxmiller, a former commercial pilot living in Georgia who surfaced last month  as a potential suspect in the van bombing.    FBI officials have never commented publicly whether Marxmiller remains a  suspect, but sources familiar with the matter said prospects of a breakthrough  involving Marxmiller's arrest appear dimmer than they did a few weeks ago.    Will Rogers said Tuesday that he welcomes Sessions' renewed confidence in  solving the attempted murder of his wife.    ""Sharon and I applaud the diligence and tenacity of the investigative  authorities, and we share their confidence in the ultimate closure of this  case,"" Rogers said.    In June, Sessions said, ""I can't express with strong confidence"" that federal  investigators will be able to solve the Rogers van bombing. He also said at  that time that he was more confident about investigators identifying those  responsible for the Flight 103 case, which also today remains unsolved. On  Tuesday, the FBI director also said he supports a bill being sponsored by a San  Diego congressman to create a reward fund for victims of international  terrorism who are attacked on U.S. soil. Under the measure being pushed by Rep.  Bill Lowery, R-San Diego, the first reward of $100,000 would be established in  the Rogers bombing.    Sessions said he believes that the reward could assist the FBI in the Rogers  probe.    ""There is, of course, a direct concern about being able to solve the case,"" he  said. ""And rewards often incite people to come and give information where they  might not have given it before.""    Karl Higgins, a San Diego aide to Lowery, said the reward measure was attached  to a major appropriations bill that has been bogged down in Senate and House  differences over other parts of the bill not relating to the reward fund.    He said the House reconsidered the bill on Tuesday and voted unanimously again  to pass the measure, and that Senate action is expected today.    Higgins added that Lowery, a close friend of the Rogers family, has become  increasingly concerned about terrorist attacks in this country.    ""I think Bill was concerned about the larger issue of terrorist acts occurring  on U.S. soil and wanted to provide an incentive for resolution of these types  of cases while working in close concert with the FBI,"" Higgins said.

The president stressed: ""We attach no importance to those  countries and place no hope in them. However, we can offer the  world the best type of human rights based on Islam and Islamic  laws.""

Praising the martyrs of the Islamic republic, especially  martyr Beheshti, the president said that some 13 years ago when  masterminds behind the bombing of the Islamic republic party's  headquarters were hatching the plot, they were vainly thinking  that through the bombing the Islamic republic would collapse and  the way would be paved for the establishment of the type of  government they were seeking for.

The number of people held in France has risen by almost 70  per cent since the start of the year, and the London-based  charity now has 300 cases on its books out of a worldwide total  of 1,000.    Almost 90 per cent of arrests in France are for  drugs-related  offences and traffickers face up to 30 years in jail under still  sentencing laws introduced two months ago.    In Thailand last week, another name was added to the list of  British detainees when Jonathan Wheeler, 34, from Hythe, Kent,  was arrested on heroin smuggling charges at Bangkok Airport.    The Foreign Office says 3,000 Britons are locked up or have  been charged across the world. Prisoners Abroad estimates that  five years ago the number was about 1,500.    A spokesman said: ""The death penalty exists for smuggling  drugs in Mauritius, China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand, and  India has a mandatory sentence of ten years in jail for  possessing anything over half a gram of hashish.""    However, France has seen such a big increase that a case  worker, Duro Olowu, has been appointed solely to handle cases  there for the charity. He said: ""Under the new sentencing  guidelines, anyone caught with 25 kilos of cannabis could be  jailed for six years. Drug conviction also earns prisoners a  fine of up to 120,000 which can add two years to a  sentence  if unpaid.    ""The relaxation of border controls had been followed by more  vigilance among the police, so that people are not just being  caught at the borders but throughout the country.    ""Arrests in Thailand always grab the headlines because those  found guilty face the death sentence and the prisons are  perceived as hell-holes. But even in Europe prison is not an  enviable experience. Families are split up and women are left in  Britain trying to bring up children on income support.""

Arab League officials, speaking after Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, had bitterly denounced the 'Crusader West' in a defiant speech, said the seven-member committee of Arab foreign ministers charged with defusing the Libyan crisis will meet in Cairo tomorrow. The committee, which groups Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Syria, Libya, Mauritania and Morocco, was formed several weeks ago to seek a face-saving end to the crisis, but its efforts have proved ineffectual. Col Gadaffi said at the weekend Libya would never surrender its 'sons' to an 'enemy country'. He repeated his outright rejection of Security Council resolution 748, which set the April 15 deadline for an air and arms embargo against Libya for its refusal to yield two men accused of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The UN is also pressing Libya to make available four of its citizens, including Col Gadaffi's brother-in-law, for questioning by the French authorities over the 1989 downing of a French UTA jet over Niger. A total of 441 people were killed in the destruction of the two aircraft. The US meanwhile repeated its instruction to its nationals to leave Libya immediately after Col Gadaffi's furious outburst on Friday in a speech marking the end of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan. The Libyan leader called on Moslems to close ranks against 'western Christian crusading forces'. 'We too have to beat the drums and close ranks and sharpen our swords and get ready for the confrontation.' Col Gadaffi's 45-minute oration came a day after the Security Council condemned Libya over attacks last Thursday against foreign missions in Tripoli. Venezuela's embassy was virtually destroyed in what were believed to be officially sanctioned demonstrations. Libya has appealed to the International Court of Justice to rule that it can try the suspects in its own jurisdiction; but this avenue has been rejected by western states, who believe the terrorist attacks were ordered by the Libyan leadership in retaliation for the 1986 US bombing of Libya, in which Col Gadaffi's adopted daughter was killed.

By committing the unannounced, treacherous April act, NATO  has sided with the Muslims in the civil war in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, a statement by the SPS main committee says,  and adds that NATO forces directly helped the Muslim offensive  by military means and clearly declared their support to the  forces that favor war.    The SPS believes that this action instigates and encourages  the militancy of the Muslim side, and hardens their unrealistic  aspirations, which could put in jeopardy the peace process by  strengthening those who advocate the war option in solving the  Bosnian drama.    This action threatens all constructive approaches to find a  just solution through political negotiations and in a peaceful  manner and resumes the policy of pressure, which places the  sides in the conflict on an unequal footing, the statement says.    The SPS warns that this brutal act also represents a basis  for preserving and maintaining permanent instability in the  Balkans and that pressure, saber rattling, frequent border  provocations, and bombing are all integral parts of a scenario  for the escalation of the war in the area.    By giving cover to NATO for this act of aggression, the  United Nations is losing its credibility in the peace mission in  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, the SPS main committee says and  concludes that by covering up and falsifying the facts, by  concealing the Muslim offensive, smuggling weapons to the Muslim  side, by making a decision to deploy Turkish forces in Bosnia,  and now by bombing the Serb positions -- the United Nations has  confirmed that it is a mere instrument in the hands of those  countries that want to achieve their interests and aspirations  in the Balkans by prolonging the war.    The SPS believes that the way out of this situation must be  sought through the prompt reaching of a truce in order to create  conditions for the resumption of negotiations, the SPS says.    The statement says that political negotiations are the only  way to reach a just and lasting solution to the conflict in the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina and appeals to those circles in the  international community who want peace in the Balkans to support  such efforts.

This was announced on Sunday  in Lvov by the chairman of the local branch of the Ukrainian  National Assembly (UNA), Andrey Shkil.    The Ukrainian National Assembly is an ultra-nationalist  organization formed in 1990. USDO paramilitary units were  formed under UNA auspices in early 1992. The same year its  members joined military actions in Moldova on the side of the  self-proclaimed Republic of Trans-Dniester on the pretext of  protecting ethnic Ukrainians in the area. In early 1993 about  100 USDO fighters joined hostilities between Georgians and  Abkhazians on the side of Georgians.    Addressing the 2nd regional conference convened by the UNA  and USDO, Shkil said that the arrests in Kiev had been followed  by searches at his organization's headquarters and at the flats  of 3 USDO activists. The police confiscated various documents,  identity cards of candidates for parliamentary elections, and  registration lists.    With reference to the arrests Andrey Shkil declared, ""This  was the first day of reprisals against the UNA. We are  beginning to inspire fear, because we have become a powerful  force."" The UNA/USDO was prepared for such confrontation when  it was taking its decision to join the election campaign, he  said.    ""We'll come to power anyway, even if all our members are  arrested,"" he declared.    The press center of Ukraine's Security Service told  Interfax-Ukraina that the Service is aware of the measures the  police took recently toward the UNA/USDO. ""But this is a police  matter,"" spokesmen for the Service stressed.    USDO's commander in chief, Yuriy Shukhevich, told  journalists: ""We are ready to fight anywhere -- in the Crimea,  in the Donetsk coal mining area, in Moscow, in St.Petersburg --  wherever a war is on.""    The UNA/USDO conference demanded that its members be freed,  and declared that it views their arrest as the beginning of  repression on the eve of elections.    Shkil also said: ""We shall not issue declarations concerning  developments in the Crimea. We are men of action: the Crimea  will be either Ukrainian, or depopulated.""    On Sunday the UNA\USDO leadership published data on their  membership: there are 510 UNA/USDO members in Lvov Region.  Besides, there are 388 USDO ""fighters"" and 286 candidates for  ""fighters"" in Lvov Region. 865 men are viewed as reservists.  400 more members of the organization are known to live in  Ternopol, Povno and Western Ukraine.

But his propaganda machine left the main point of interest and the reason of Sunday's attack a mystery. Three sites hit by missiles have been confirmed: the lobby of the Rashid hotel in Baghdad was badly damaged, a house in the suburb of Karada was half-demolished and a factory in Zafaraniya, 10 miles south of Baghdad and the announced target of the allied attack, was hit. Western journalists, despite being escorted to the two civilian sites, were denied access to the factory at Zafaraniya. Described as a nuclear site by the allies and a facility for manufacturing industrial equipment by the Iraqis, an army official prevented an organised Ministry of Information tour of the site, despite the fact it had been viewed by some journalists immediately after the bombing. 'Yesterday was one day, today is another, he said. The government took advantage of the high-profile Rashid bombing by holding a funeral for the two people who were killed in the hotel. Escorted by a ceremonial army brass band, a large group of dignitaries, hotel staff and mourning relatives, the coffins of Ameriha Toma, a receptionist at the hotel, and a female guest were marched to a burial site to the accompaniment of a funeral dirge. Soon afterwards, more than 1,000 delegates at the Sixth Islamic Conference, who were removed to another hotel after the bombing last night, descended on the hotel to conduct the day's proceedings, and Rashid staff attempted to convey a sense of business as usual. It was the same all over Baghdad. Iraq has been under seige in military and economic terms almost continually since the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980; coping in tragic circumstances has become a way of life. However, a sense of despair was apparent after Sunday's attack, and disbelief that the capital was once again under fire from the allies. At the Karada site, where one woman was killed and her two daughters injured when their house was hit by a missile, Dr Mohammad Dowee, a military doctor and neighbour whose three daughters were injured by shattering glass, accused the allies of not caring about Iraqi civilians. 'If people (in the west) saw the exact picture, they wouldn't agree with what happened here. Killing ordinary Iraqis will not help enforce their demands,' he said.

0,FT921-13292 ,"FT921-13292 _AN-CAVBGADTFT 920122   FT  22 JAN 92 / UN censures Libya over Lockerbie PanAm bombing      By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent      NEW YORK   THE UN Security Council called unanimously on the Libyan government last night to answer fully official charges that its agents caused the 1988 Lockerbie air disaster and blew up a French airliner in West Africa. In its resolution, the council strongly deplored 'the fact that the Libyan government has not yet responded effectively' to requests for co-operation. It urged Tripoli to provide a full and effective response 'so as to contribute to the elimination of international terorrism'. However, the resolution proposed by Britain, France and the US stopped short of expressly blaming the Libyan government for destroying PanAmerican flight 103 in December 1988 with the loss of 270 lives and the UTA flight 772 in Niger nine months later. That crash took 177 lives. None the less, the UN action was widely interpreted as a warning to Libya that it must turn over two alleged terrorists named by Britain and the US in the Lockerbie case or face a threat of economic sanctions. France has not requested the extradition of Libyans it suspects of causing the UTA crash. At the outset of the debate, Mr Jadallah Belgassem, the Libyan minister for strategic industries, termed 'completely baseless' evidence uncovered by British investigators. He said Libya's own inquiries had made no progress, because Britain, the US and France refused to reveal evidence in their possession. Libya had already co-operated and was ready to do so 'to the fullest extent', but in a legal context not the political one imposed by raising the question improperly in the Security Council. He cited the 1971 Montreal Convention for the protection of civil aviation and affirmed Libya's readiness to abide by it. Mr Belgassem called for neutral arbitration and referral of the case to the World Court if that failed. Sir David Hannay, UK delegate and Security Council president, replied that the convention was 'simply irrelevant' to the issue. Those accused of bombing the PanAm flight must face and receive a proper trial that, clearly, should be held in Scotland or the US. It was not practical for an international tribunal to conduct a trial and the World Court had no criminal jurisdiction. Representatives of Sudan and Iraq, which are not Council members, and the Arab League, supported the idea of arbitration and the delegate of Iran said Tripoli was not legally bound to turn over the accused Libyans.

0,FT932-13048 ,"FT932-13048 _AN-DDZBRAAEFT 930426   FT  26 APR 93 / Calls for tighter security: Anti-IRA campaign criticised as City is bombed for second time      By ANDREW JACK, RICHARD WATERS and PHILIP STEPHENS   THE GOVERNMENT faces calls to sharpen its anti-terrorist campaign after a massive IRA bomb in the City of London left one man dead and caused damage provisionally estimated at more than Pounds 300m. As thousands of City workers were confronted with the prospect of being moved into temporary office space, the prime minister will come under pressure from backbenchers for a much wider review of the government's efforts to halt the IRA's mainland bombing campaign. Senior ministers, however, were cautioning last night against any 'knee-jerk' response that would add to the propaganda value for the IRA of the latest attack. Downing Street was seeking to avoid a formal Commons statement on the bombing because of its longstanding view that government should not add to the publicity on which the IRA thrives. Two other bombs exploded on Saturday night, destroying minicabs hijacked by terrorists to attack Downing Street and New Scotland Yard. The drivers ignored instructions and alerted police. One explosion was near King's Cross station, the other in Finsbury Park. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said early estimates of the damage inflicted by the City bombing, which have run as high as Pounds 1bn, may prove to be exaggerated. It said the damage was likely to be on the same scale as last year's Baltic Exchange bombing. The government signalled last night that it was ready to pick up most of the bill for the devastation. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, sought to underpin confidence in London's position by emphasising that the government was 'playing its part' by acting as reinsurer of last resort against terrorist attacks. Sir Francis McWilliams, Lord Mayor of London, co-ordinating the effort to clear up the City and protect its reputation as Europe's leading financial centre, said as he toured the devastated area: 'The Stock Exchange will be working, Lloyd's (insurance market) will be working, the Baltic Exchange will be working, Liverpool Street station will be open and London Underground will be working.' Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the Corporation of the City of London's policy committee, estimated that at least 20,000 people might need to be temporarily relocated from offices nearest the blast. Mr David Mellor, the former cabinet minister, called for a review of security policy, echoing the private view of many ministers and Tory MPs that the government's counter-terrorist effort needs to be sharpened. Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, called for extended anti-terrorist powers. He said: 'I want the power to set up road checks wherever and whenever, without specific reason for doing so.' Mr Major plans to use a speech this morning to the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to underline his government's determination not to bow to terrorism. The prime minister will emphasise also that the government will intensify its efforts to improve security against further attacks. Mr Lamont, who is hosting the EBRD meeting, said: 'I have every confidence that business will continue to locate here and work here successfully. To do otherwise would be to succumb to terrorism.' That message was echoed in private talks yesterday between the Lord Mayor and Mr Major, who indicated that the government would stick to its commitment to underwrite the insurance costs, even though legislation to set up such arrangements has not yet been passed by the Commons. Mr Major has invited Sir Francis to another meeting this week to discuss further action to tighten security in the City, particularly at night and during weekends. In the City, officials said at least two buildings would be demolished and another 20 would need important structural repairs. One man died and 44 were injured in the explosion on Saturday, for which the IRA formally claimed responsibility yesterday afternoon. The dead man was Mr Ed Henty, a News of the World photographer. The blast affected a wider area than the bombing at the Baltic Exchange in April last year - partly because Bishopsgate is a wider street - although much of the damage beyond the core area was relatively minor. The City Corporation co-ordinated the clear-up of more than 200 tons of broken glass from the streets throughout the weekend.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Any members of right-wing organisations which might be  involved in bombing soft targets and killing civilians were sick  and cowardly, Hoopstad Freedom Front chairman and SADF [South  African Defense Force] Sergeant-Major Obie du Plessis said this  week. ""I call them Klipdrift [liquor brand] soldiers -- they  get drunk and then go around trying to be soldiers. They are  fighting a war of cowards and we are not sympathetic to their  cause. It is wrong to kill innocent people.""    Du Plessis, a member of the SADF's special services, was  instrumental in organising eight mobile polling stations to  visit rural areas where farmers had refused to provide transport  to polling stations for their workers. He denied farmers in the  Hoopstad, Wesselbron and Bultfontein districts had been  intimidating farm labourers, but claimed that Freedom Front  supporters were being threatened by extreme right-wingers.    Du Plessis said he and Freedom Front leader Gen Constand  Viljoen had received death threats. Businessmen in the area  were being threatened with boycotts if they voted for the party.  ""We are accused of being traitors -- of betraying the volk  [Afrikaner people]. But they pose no real threat. These  right-wingers are hopeless and stupid. All they do is play  soldier games. The Freedom Front knows what real war is, which  is why we are negotiating, not fighting for a volkstaat  [Afrikaner homeland].""    Du Plessis, a farmer himself, believed the Front had the  support of 90 percent of the farmers in the Hoopstad district.  However, many had recently resigned from the party, not wanting  to be seen to be supporting the organisation publicly, following  threats from CP [Conservative Party] and other right-wing  organisations' supporters.    Du Plessis, who said he would not serve in the SADF under a  black government, doubted whether there would be an uprising of  farmers against a black-led government. However, he said  attempts by the new government to disarm the farmers, most of  whom fought in the Angolan and Namibian campaigns, could trigger  a ""10 or 20-year-long civil war that would make the war in  Bosnia look insignificant. We would not fight a guerrilla war.  After all those years of fighting against the ANC and the  communists precisely because they fought a terrorist war, how  could we turn around and do the same thing? No -- we are  gentlemen and we would never resort to terror tactics.""     "
0,FT941-7920 ,"FT941-7920 _AN-EBWDCAAFFT 940223   FT  23 FEB 94 / Senior CIA agent charged with spying for Moscow      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   The US issued a strong formal protest to the Russian government yesterday after the arrest of a senior Central Intelligence Agency official and his wife on charges of spying for Moscow. 'It is a very serious case,' President Bill Clinton said after the arrests had been made public. Charges filed in a federal court in Virginia said Mr Aldrich Ames, a 31-year CIA veteran, had spied for the Soviet Union from 1985 until its collapse in 1991, and then continued to spy for the Russian Federation foreign intelligence service. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, summoned the Russian charge d'affaires to the State Department to deliver a strongly worded protest, and Mr Thomas Pickering, the US ambassador to Russia, issued a similar complaint to officials in Moscow. White House officials refused to discuss in detail what consequences the incident might have for US-Russian relations, but would not rule out the possibility that it could affect the level of US financial aid to Russia. Last night, a White House official demanded that Russia voluntarily withdraw the diplomats who handled the CIA agent. If Russia does not take the action, the official said, 'We'll have to take the action ourselves.' Although now in the CIA's counter-narcotics unit, Mr Ames was previously in charge of the Soviet division of its counter-intelligence arm. Government officials said there had been suspicions as early as 1985 that a mole might be at work, but the investigation of Mr Ames and his wife Maria began only 10 months ago. Papers filed with the federal court said top-secret documents unrelated to Mr Ames's work had been found in his office last June. A subsequent search of the couple's home produced a typewriter ribbon from which agents extracted damaging information. Justice Department officials said Mrs Ames, a 41-year-old Colombian-born, naturalised US citizen, was co-operating with the investigation, but it was not clear if she had agreed to testify against her husband. Mr Ames, 52, and his wife allegedly received more than Dollars 1.5m in exchange for some of the most damaging secrets ever lost by the US, including details of CIA operations and agents. Officials said the arrests capped a two-year probe, which had been apparently triggered by a tip from a KGB defector. Last night Mr Toby Jessel, Conservative MP for Twickenham, said he would raise the issue with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, to find out if British security had been put at risk or been infiltrated.

Speaking at a press conference where they discussed this  normally quiet British territory's 7.8 percent increase in crime  from 1992, Ratcliffe said, ""There is evidence drugs are shipped  here to go to north. Some do find the local market but it's  impossible that all seized drugs are for the domestic market.""    Ratcliffe said the 4,330 pounds of marijuana and 52 pounds  of  cocaine seized by police in 1992 would represent a major  consumption by all of the islands 27, 000 residents if it stayed  in the Cayman Islands.    He said he believed the amounts seized represent only 10  percent of all drugs reaching the Cayman Islands. And he added  these figures were only what police seized, not what customs  officers confiscated in 1993. 1993 customs seizures were not  available.    Cutts said Cayman ""is like a giant warehouse"" for the  trans-shipment of drugs from Jamaica and Honduras. He said most  of the marijuana and cocaine come in boats under cover of night.    The Cayman Islands has no coast guard or navy and only one  police patrol boat for approxiamately 300 miles of coast line.  Ratcliffe said the 7.8-percent rise in crime was directly  attributable to drug arrests and offences.    ""There is evidence there are far more drugs on Grand Cayman  than have ever been here before,"" he said. Drug-related arrests  jumped from 606 in 1992 to 894 in 1993, a rise of 47.5 percent.  There were 3,298 crime reports in 1993 compared with 3058 in  1993, Ratcliffe said.    The number of burglaries in the territory fell in 1993 from  765 to 680. The solution rate on those crimes was 36 percent, up  12 percent from 1992, said Ratcliffe.    Drugs are an increasing problem in the Cayman Islands. A  local high court judge recently said 80 percent of all inmates  at the local prison were convicted on drug or drug related  offences.    Ratcliffe said he believed more than 80 percent of property  crimes--burglary and theft--were done to obtain property or  money to trade for drugs.    For 1994, Cayman has already had its first ever armed  robbery  of a tourist. Two local men have been arrested in connection  with the incident and are currently awaiting trial.     "

His brother Liu Qing, who is chairman of ""China  Human Rights"" in New York, is 99 percent sure he has been  arrested by the mainland authorities. Zhang Ling, another  member of the LGLR in Anhui, has also been taken away by  security personnel. Liu Qing is worried that a new round of  dissident arrests has started in Beijing.    On 9 March this year, Liu Nianchun, Yuan Hongbing, and Wang  Zhongqiu officially applied to the authorities for the  establishment of the LGLR. The application was handed in by Liu  Nianchun to the Ministry of Civil Administration. As this was a  pioneering undertaking on the mainland, indicating that the  mainland's democracy movement had become more open, organized,  and legalized, it attracted attention from the international  media. The organization has a preparatory committee with more  than 120 members nationwide, but because of their worries about  large-scale arrests by the mainland authorities, their names  have not been made public for the time being. Instead, Liu  Nianchun and the other two shouldered the responsibility and  appeared in public.    Of the three men, Yuan Hongbin, a lecturer in the Law  Faculty  of Beijing University, was first arrested by the mainland  authorities on 2 April. Another organizer, Wang Zhongqiu, was  also arrested on 1 June. Wang Jiaqi, a postgraduate at the Law  Faculty of Beijing University and another key member of the LGLR  who was arrested together with Yuan Hongbin, escaped while being  escorted from Beijing to Hebei's Tangshan Prison. With the  assistance of underground pro-democracy organizations, he  successfully arrived in Hong Kong on 15 April, gained U.S.  political asylum, and went to New York via London.    Liu Qing pointed out that Liu Nianchun had actually intended  to leave for Jiangsu and lie low on the eve of the 4 June  incident. His wife, who is in Beijing, last received a phone  call from him on 26 May, and he said he would return to Beijing  the following week. Liu Nianchun and one of his friends both  disappeared on 28 May after they had a telephone conversation.  Wang Zhongqiu also disappeared at the same time and his arrest  was later confirmed.     "

By RONALD J. OSTROW and ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      WASHINGTON      The United States repeatedly turned a blind eye to Iraqi-sponsored terrorism  during the 1980s by leaving the nation off its official terrorist-state list,  the CIA's former counterterrorist operations chief charged Tuesday.    ""We looked the other way when we knew that Iraq was carrying out a terrorist  operation,"" said Vincent M. Cannistraro, who retired from the CIA on Oct. 1. He  branded the decision to keep Iraq off the terrorist list -- a designation that  carries economic sanctions -- ""a terrible mistake.""    A government counterterrorism official who declined to be identified contended  that Cannistraro was ""stretching things a bit.""    While ""we knew they didn't have completely clean hands,"" there was no evidence  of terrorism after the end of 1982, the year Iraq was dropped from the State  Department listing of specific terrorism sponsorship, he said.    An official of another agency with counterterrorism responsibilities said he  would not dispute the retired CIA official's assessment but would give no  specifics.    Cannistraro declined to give details of U.S. knowledge of Iraqi sponsorship of  terrorism. Now a senior fellow with the National Strategy Information Center, a  nonprofit organization concerned with intelligence issues, Cannistraro formerly  held intelligence positions with the National Security Council and the Pentagon  in addition to his service at the CIA.    Talking with reporters, Cannistraro said: ""There was intelligence information  available at various stages that indicated quite clearly that Iraq was involved  in the sponsorship of terrorism. This goes over two Administrations,"" he added,  referring to the Bush and Reagan administrations.    Cannistraro said Iraq was kept off the State Department list because during the  Iran-Iraq War the United States considered Iran its principal enemy.    ""This was an instance of our using short-term policy interests to confuse our  longer-term coherent policy objectives,"" he said. ""That's what I'm opposed to.""    Cannistraro's allegations would indicate significantly greater tolerance of  Iraqi misdeeds than earlier known at a time when the United States was trying  to cultivate favor with the government of Saddam Hussein.    Earlier, officials have acknowledged that the United States supplied Iraq with  military intelligence to use against Iran and later allowed export of some  technology that might have military applications.    Until now, there has been no indication that the United States was willing to  overlook terrorism by the Iraqis. Iraq was returned to the list of states  sponsoring terrorism in September, a month after it invaded Kuwait.    Cannistraro contended that government officials who were monitoring Iraq saw  involvement in terrorism ""very clearly,"" but were undercut by the Iraqi desk at  the State Department, which oversees U.S. relations with that nation.    ""The country desk would constantly undercut the intelligence information by  saying, 'No, no that's not valid. You've only one source for that,' ""  Cannistraro said. ""In other words, there'd be a whole series of  rationalizations for why they should not believe that Iraq was involved in  terrorism, because it wasn't in their interest to believe it.    ""That's a major problem,"" he added. ""We've seen that with Iraq, and I think  we're seeing that today with Syria.    ""We are now very anxious to cultivate relations with (Syrian leader Hafez)  Assad, because from a foreign policy point of view it is important for us to  have a larger Arab component in Saudi Arabia. And therefore we're overlooking  some of the really horrible things Assad has done and continues to do,""  Cannistraro said.    Turning to the investigation of the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight  103, Cannistraro said the Justice Department ""has made substantial progress in  identifying the modus operandi by which that bomb got on board.""    He said he thought the department was ""very, very close"" to obtaining an  indictment of those who carried out the bombing of the New York-bound flight  from London.    The bombing killed all 259 people aboard and 11 residents of Lockerbie,  Scotland.    But a source familiar with the investigation disputed Cannistraro's timetable,  suggesting that he was confusing intelligence information with that needed to  support a criminal indictment.

0,FT924-442 ,"FT924-442 _AN-CL2A6ACDFT 921224   FT  24 DEC 92 / UN still wrangling over Bosnia resolution      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   MEMBERS of the United Nations Security Council are still at odds over a resolution on the enforcement of the no-fly zone the UN has declared over Bosnia, and diplomats do not expect a text to be agreed before Christmas. Main points at issue are the length of the deadline to be given to Serbia, and how much force to use to enforce the ban on military flights, as well as the traditional UN argument over who should be in command. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation yesterday agreed to forward enforcement options to the UN, including combat aircraft patrols to deter Serbian aircraft from taking off, downing aircraft infringing the no-fly zone, and bombing Serbian airfields. Some US officials have argued for this last option as the most effective way of enforcing the zone - especially as fighter patrols would have limited effect on the hedge-hopping helicopters which are the principal violators of the zone. The US also wants a short deadline, possibly as little as 15 days. France and the UK, which both have troops in Bosnia, want only the minimum necessary force to be used, and argue for a substantial delay before any enforcement action is taken against Serbian aircraft. They question whether action as drastic as bombing airstrips is necessary when the number of violations of the no-fly zone is diminishing and when UN relief flights are once again getting into Sarajevo. However, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, yesterday reported that allied aircraft had last week spotted warplanes over Bosnia, whereas the Serbs had previously been thought to be flying only supply aircraft into the no-fly zone. Complicating the debate is the question of sending UN peace-keepers into Kosovo to head off any possible Serbian aggression there. Some diplomats argue that it would be better to get these observers into Kosovo before embarking on an open conflict with Serbia over the no-fly issue. But these practical points, and the underlying concerns about the safety of UN troops now on the ground in Bosnia, reflect a deeper philosophical debate over the boundary between peace-keeping and peace-making. Mr Boutros Ghali argues that if enforcement is to be undertaken the UN peace-keepers must be withdrawn and the relief operation halted.

Mr Ibrahim Mohammed Beshari, the Libyan foreign minister, vowed yesterday that his country would not 'surrender' to demands that it hand over its nationals for trial in the west. A despondent Egyptian foreign minister, Mr Amr Moussa, said after a meeting with President Hosni Mubarak and Mr Beshari: 'I see that things are difficult and are not progressing towards a breakthrough the way one would like.' The United Nations Security Council is due early this week to approve a resolution that would impose sanctions, including an arms and air embargo, against Libya over its refusal to hand over Libyans allegedly involved in the 1988 and 1989 bombings of US and French airliners in which a total of 441 people died. The Arab League yesterday sent a letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, outlining its understanding of the Libyan position. League officials would not be drawn on its contents, but they expressed little optimism of an early resolution of the crisis. Moderate Arab states, notably Egypt, have been trying for months to head off a looming confrontation with the west, fearing domestic troubles if Libya is subjected to UN-imposed penalties. Last week, a compromise appeared to be in the making when Libya indicated it might be prepared to hand over the two suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, to the Arab League which would have passed them to the UN secretary general. But Tripoli balked, prompting speculation about serious differences in the Libyan regime between Colonel Muammer Gadaffi and his number two, Major Abdel-Salam Jalloud. Col Gadaffi is being portrayed as a voice of reason in the Egyptian press, while Maj Jalloud is depicted as the main obstacle to compromise. Egyptians were furious last week after an Arab League committee led by its secretary general, Dr Esmat Abdel Meguid, was insulted when it went to Tripoli to discuss the crisis. Egypt was particularly incensed by a despatch carried by Jana, the Libyan news-agency, which alleged that the Arab League committee was acting under pressure from the 'Crusader West'. This week's expected Security Council resolution follows one agreed in January, demanding that Libya hand over nationals involved in bringing down the two aircraft.

GERMANY HOLDS 7 FOR AIDING IRAQ ON POISON GAS FACILITIES      From United Press International      BONN      West German authorities Friday arrested seven people, including a former  intelligence officer of Iraqi descent, and accused them of helping Iraq build  poison gas installations, a state prosecutor said.    Friedrich Hoffmann, a senior state prosecutor in Darmstadt, said the suspects  are suspected of violating West German export legislation by selling sensitive  technology to Iraq.    He said investigations have been under way for several years because the  authorities needed to prove the technology was destined for use in poison gas  factories, which are similar to herbicide manufacturing plants.    Hoffmann said among those arrested was a man identified as Al Khadi, 51, a West  German citizen of Iraqi descent who once worked for the Federal Information  Service, the West German intelligence agency comparable to the CIA.    In 1987, Khadi, who had also served as a representative of the West German firm  Preussag in Iraq, was sentenced to death by the Iraqi authorities for spying.  After intervention by senior West German officials, the sentence was commuted  to life imprisonment. Khadi was later released and allowed to return to West  Germany.    Hoffmann said employees of the Pilot Plant, Preussag and Water Engineering  Trading firms were among those arrested, but stressed that the companies were  not believed to have been involved in the illegal deals.    The arrests followed claims in the West German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel  that West Germans had played a major role in the development of nerve gas  factories in Iraq.    In its latest edition, the magazine said Khadi had supplied chemical  installations to Iraq through the Hamburg-based WET, of which he is a part  owner and manager.    The magazine said the factory was designed to produce lethal Tabun and Sarin  nerve gases. It said Iraq also bought from WET tons of components used for the  production of nerve gases.    Der Spiegel said Preussag employees had worked together with Khadi on the  project.    The arrests follow a string of scandals over the export to potential conflict  areas of technology for chemical and biological warfare.    In June, a West German industrialist was sentenced to five years imprisonment  for helping build a chemical weapons plant in Rabta, near the Libyan capital of  Tripoli.    Meanwhile, a spokesman for the West German Defense Ministry said the East  German military is still training Iraqi and Libyan officers.

Ethnocentrism""]    [Text] The U.S. recognition of the small state of Skopje  with its temporary name, which is expected within the next few  hours, and our country's endorsement of the European Union [EU]  decision on possible air bombings in Bosnia are not offered for  domestic opposition nor for trying to be more nationalist than  the next fellow.    It happens that in both cases, in which we are called upon  to  accept or support decisions unfavorable to our country, the  positions of our political parties are almost identical. No  party and no Greek agrees with the air bombing in Bosnia, which  would bring the disaster of the war to our borders. At the same  time, there is no Greek who is not unhappy with Washington's  decision to proceed with the recognition of the small state that  tries to usurp the name of Macedonia.    This unity of political positions and popular will  represents  at this time our most significant national advantage, which we  ought to utilize and promote and not downgrade or sacrifice on  the altar of petty political expediency and partisan prejudice.    What weight (or rather political responsibility) could be  used now to urge the exercise of a Greek veto in NATO or the  cancellation of an EU decision--even by ""utilizing"" the Greek  presidency--with regard to the possible bombing of Bosnia? At  the same time, what political seriousness is there in  suggestions for public disapproval and condemnation of  Washington's imminent action as hostile to our country?    Fortunately, the ordinary Greek citizen understands and  realizes the restructuring changes taking place worldwide and  feels particularly lucky because he belongs to the European  family in which nobody--even the strongest partner--can impose  his will unilaterally. In this same family, however, even the  weakest member has the right to demand equality of the  Community's political, social, and economic rights or  achievements and, what is most important, to entrust his  national security to a political solidarity and defense  partnership of the Twelve, things that are safeguarded by  treaties.    In a similar spirit, a certain part of the Greek people have  overcome their past bitterness, which suffered from an  anti-American and anti-NATO syndrome. These people managed to  overcome this position by merely asking themselves ""how is it  and why"" are Albania, Bulgaria, and Skopje today hotly pursuing  admission to NATO (to refer only to our bordering neighbors who  until very recently belonged to the ""enemy"" camp)?    Could it be that this simple--but not naive--question should  force the remaining supporters of pure ethnocentrism to ponder  things irrespective of their right-wing or left-wing origin?  This is so because their recommendations finally lead to the  same result: our international isolation and national  weakening....     "

Police had made earlier arrests in the case, but Wednesday was the first time  they were able to locate so many of the bogus documents allegedly used in the  scam and the equipment used to produce them, officials said. At four Los  Angeles County homes -- in Lennox, Hawthorne, the Wilshire district and  southwestern Los Angeles -- authorities found thousands of stolen and  counterfeit identification cards, police said.    ""It's a very, very sophisticated, effective forgery ring,"" Los Angeles Police  Detective Pat Riley said. ""They were able, with ease, to withdraw lots of money  and the only time the bank (account) holder would know was at the end of the  month when he looked at his bank statement. We figure they stole millions of  dollars.""    As part of the scheme, the suspects allegedly mass-produced fake driver's  licenses, credit cards, Social Security cards and other picture identification,  then used the bogus materials to withdraw millions of dollars from other  people's accounts at banks throughout the state, Riley said.

Police had made earlier arrests in the case, but Wednesday was the first time  they were able to locate so many of the bogus documents allegedly used in the  scam and the equipment used to produce them, officials said. At four Los  Angeles County homes -- in Lennox, Hawthorne, the Wilshire district and  southwestern Los Angeles -- authorities found thousands of stolen and  counterfeit identification cards, police said.    ""It's a very, very sophisticated, effective forgery ring,"" Los Angeles Police  Detective Pat Riley said.

We figure they stole millions of  dollars.""    As part of the scheme, the suspects allegedly mass-produced fake driver's  licenses, credit cards, Social Security cards and other picture identification,  then used the bogus materials to withdraw millions of dollars from other  people's accounts at banks throughout the state, Riley said.

Arab political  circles in some Arab countries began to discuss these questions  after they received secret diplomatic reports from Tehran that a  new plan was under way to rebuild Shiite organizations in Iraq,  Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain and to increase financial and  political support for extremist Islamic organizations in  Palestine and Lebanon.    The information AL-MUHARRIR has received indicates that  Tehran has allocated large amounts of money to cover the  activities of its satellite organizations.    Figures in this regard show that millions of dollars have  been allocated to rebuild and breathe a new life into Shiite  organizations in the Arabian Gulf region.    The main organizations and the amounts of money they will  receive are as follows:     -  The Islamic Front for the Liberation of Iraq, which will  receive $100,000 per month.    -  The Iraqi al-Da'wah Party, which will receive $150,000 per  month.    -  The Popular Front for the Liberation of the Arabian  Peninsula,  an anti-Saudi organization, which will receive $150,000 per  month.    -  The Islamic Movement for the Liberation of Bahrain, which  will  receive $70,000 per month.        It is worth mentioning that these four organizations have  offices in Tehran. Diplomatic reports say that by supporting  these organizations, Iran is seeking to stir up unrest in Gulf  countries to restore Iranian influence, which prevailed during  Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's reign and which diminished  gradually after the mullahs controlled the government and after  the end of the Iraq-Iran war.    Reports also say that pro-Iranian organizations carried out  bombing operations in Kuwait years before the entry of the Iraqi  forces in it. They add that Iran was responsible for some  bombing operations and shootouts that occurred in Kuwait after  the return of al-Sabah family to power.    The same diplomatic reports say that the Iranian leadership  has drawn up a new plan to support the Islamic Jihad Movement in  Palestine, led by Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, and to provide necessary  amounts of money to the movement to enable it to build bases in  the occupied territories.    Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command, presented al-Shaqaqi to  the Iranian officials. Since then, the latter has been  receiving $100,000 per month to cover the costs of his  organization in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, in addition to other  amounts of money being paid to the occupied territories' branch  through special channels.

[Ja'ja'] Instead of quoting our sources, come to us and see  for yourself, then you can write about what you are going to see  all the way to my residence in Ghidras.    [AL-HAYAH] Do you mean that there are roadblocks?    [Ja'ja'] The issue is not the number of roadblocks or the  troops, but the manner in which they are deployed along the  roads leading to Ghidras. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Have you contacted His Excellency President Ilyas  al-Hirawi?    [Ja'ja'] No, I have not contacted him so far. He was busy  yesterday with the breakfast banquet he gave in B'abda Palace.    [AL-HAYAH] And why have you not contacted him today  (yesterday) [11 March]?    [Ja'ja'] We do not want to disturb his excellency with this  issue. We are leaving him to concentrate on the main issue,  that is the Middle East negotiations.    [AL-HAYAH] And with the Army command?    [Ja'ja'] There are no contacts with the command. The  contacts are made with some authoritative officers in the area.  They reply that this presence lies within security deployments  in the provinces. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] The Army has been deployed in Ghidras for a long  time.    [Ja'ja'] The nearest point to Ghidras was less than a  kilometer away. This point was concealed and not on the main  road. We asked the Army command at the time about this point's  task. We were told that its job was to supervise the valley.    [AL-HAYAH] And what is happening now?    [Ja'ja'] The Army is deployed in five directions: a point  is set up in each direction. There is a point on the road  leading to here.    [AL-HAYAH] It is said that the measures include all areas,  and that security units have lists of suspects involved in the  bombing incidents.    [Ja'ja'] Fine. Let them come and tell us who they are, and  I am prepared to hand them over. Why overtake events when the  investigation is under way? [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] It is reported that they have lists of suspects  involved in security incidents, including an attempt on the  president's life, and that the accusation is leveled at Raji  'Abdu, nicknamed the ""captain.""    [Ja'ja'] Raji 'Abdu is not accused in the case concerning  his excellency the president. He was accused of bombing the  Rumyah barracks. Anyhow, his case is now in the hands of the  Lebanese judiciary. When a verdict is passed and it becomes  clear whether he has any link, they will see whether or not we  are going to hand him over.

George Simeon, leader of a cartel called ""Los Trinitarios""  (The Trinidadians), was captured on the beach in Sucre State as  he received samples of what General Julio C. Pena Sanchez of the  Venezuelan Guardia Nacional described as a future shipment of  high quality cocaine.    The cartel was said to have been shipping between 500 and  1,000 kilos of cocaine, worth between TT$175 and TT$350 million,  monthly from Colombia through Venezuela via Trinidad to points  in the Caribbean and North Atlantic.    The arrest of the group was the leading item in Venezuela's  largest-selling newspaper, EL NACIONAL last Wednesday. Simeon, a  Trindadian, was arrested along with other members of the cartel  who were held simultaneously in other parts of the country in a  massive Guardia Nacional exercise which also resulted in the  seizure of six vehicles.    General Pena Sanchez, Operations Commander of the Guardia  Nacional, announced the arrests last Tuesday, following the  events which occurred on Saturday, November 6.    He said the arrests had been the result of seven months of  investigations and surveillance by the joint armed forces aimed  at breaking the cartel, which was based in Maracaibo in Zulia  state and had a network which spread across several states in  Venezuela.    A total of 165 officers of the Guardia Nacional took part in  the raid which captured Simeon and a Venezuelan national on the  Sucre beach. Other members of the drug network were captured in  Maracaibo, Zulia, Acarigua, Portuguesa and Rio Caribe. The  Guardia Nacional has traced the drug route from Cali, Cucuta,  Colombia; to Urena, Tachira, Acarigua, Carupano, Sucre and Rio  Caribe in Venezuela, and then to Trinidad.    Since then, in an apparently unrelated case, another  Trinidadian, Wharfe Ashton, Alton, has been arrested on drug  trafficking charges after the intelligence arm of the police  service monitored a drug shipment bound for Miami. Alton was  shot in the leg as he tried to escape.    The big Venezuelan drug bust is the second major report in a  week involving the discovery of multi-million drug operations in  which Trinidadians were implicated.    Grenada Coast Guard intercepted an inter-island vessel on  November 5, the same day of the Venezuelan operations, and  found 60 kilos of cocaine hidden in a cargo of furniture. The  boat had left Port of Spain the afternoon before. An Arima man,  Sylvon Liverpool, was arrested together with five others.     "

The latest bombing victim, Washington County Circuit Court Judge John P.  Corderman, 47, remained in stable condition and under armed guard at a local  hospital Saturday after a pipe bomb exploded Friday afternoon at his apartment.  Doctors said they believe Corderman was holding a package containing the bomb  in his lap when it exploded, rupturing his eardrums and sending 3/4-inch pieces  of shrapnel into the left side of his groin and right hand.    In the four earlier incidents, each bomb was described as a ""nail bomb"" and was  mailed in a shoe-box-sized package postmarked in Georgia. Officials theorize a  racial motivation in those incidents, since each of the victims had at some  time been involved in efforts to desegregate school districts in the South.    Federal and local law enforcement agencies are sharing information about the  five bombings, said Jack Killorin, a spokesman for the Treasury Department's  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. However, he added, there is ""nothing  to establish a tie"" between the Corderman bombing and the others.    Killorin said the Hagerstown bomb package was ""different in technology,"" noting  that there were two bombs in the same package. Investigators said the  Hagerstown bomb, while deadly, was not as powerful as the other four bombs.    The U.S. Postal Inspection Service confirmed that the pipe bomb, packaged in a  Christmas food gift box, was sent through the mail and not through some other  delivery service, said spokesman Paul Griffo in Washington.    Witnesses and neighbors had told investigators they saw a man deliver a package  to Corderman's third-floor apartment shortly before the 2:30 p.m. explosion.    Asked if there was a suspect in the bombing, Killorin declined to comment.    Lt. Robert Frick of the Hagerstown Police Department said he didn't expect to  have any suspects for at least ""the next 48 hours.""    Frick said police checked the Washington County courthouse Friday night for  bombs ""just as a precaution to make sure nobody left anything under a judge's  bench or anything."" He said the search did not find any additional bombs.    In the earlier bombings, U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert S.  Vance was killed at his home in Mountain Brook, Ala., and Savannah, Ga., lawyer  and Alderman Robert Robinson was killed in his office. Similar bombs were  discovered and disarmed at a federal courthouse in Atlanta and at an NAACP  office in Jacksonville, Fla.    Killorin noted that many judges and civil rights groups across the country have  received ""phony bomb packages and phony threatening calls"" since last week's  incidents.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service confirmed that the pipe bomb, packaged in a  Christmas food gift box, was sent through the mail and not through some other  delivery service, said spokesman Paul Griffo in Washington.    Witnesses and neighbors had told investigators they saw a man deliver a package  to Corderman's third-floor apartment shortly before the 2:30 p.m. explosion.    Asked if there was a suspect in the bombing, Killorin declined to comment.    Lt. Robert Frick of the Hagerstown Police Department said he didn't expect to  have any suspects for at least ""the next 48 hours.""    Frick said police checked the Washington County courthouse Friday night for  bombs ""just as a precaution to make sure nobody left anything under a judge's  bench or anything."" He said the search did not find any additional bombs.    In the earlier bombings, U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert S.  Vance was killed at his home in Mountain Brook, Ala., and Savannah, Ga., lawyer  and Alderman Robert Robinson was killed in his office. Similar bombs were  discovered and disarmed at a federal courthouse in Atlanta and at an NAACP  office in Jacksonville, Fla.    Killorin noted that many judges and civil rights groups across the country have  received ""phony bomb packages and phony threatening calls"" since last week's  incidents.

By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Oxnard's effort to eliminate what police describe as the center of drug  activity in the downtown area has met with a small snag: Bertha Ochoa.    The former owner of the Lemon Tree Motel was arrested Monday for defying a  court order that bans her from entering the 25-year-old motel, which the city  has acquired under eminent domain proceedings.    Ochoa was released by police on her own recognizance and returned to the motel  to spend the night with her daughter. On Tuesday city officials and police  ordered Ochoa to leave, saying she had been inciting tenants against the city.  Threatened with a second arrest, Ochoa left the motel voluntarily.    City officials call it a small victory in their effort to eliminate a  continuing source of headaches. Police consider the Lemon Tree Motel a source  of drug activity.    But Ochoa said she will not give up. She said that her arrest on Monday  violated her civil rights and vowed to appeal the city's eminent domain  decision to a federal court.    Ochoa said she has lived in the motel for years but has been forced to leave  without the same 90-day eviction notice sent by the city to other tenants.    ""We are not in Russia or Cuba. They cannot treat us this way,"" Ochoa said as  two Oxnard police officers looked on.    Peter Kuetzing, a lawyer representing the city of Oxnard, said Ochoa was warned  last week that if she did not leave the motel by Monday she would be arrested.  Ochoa was never a tenant and the city acted within the law by arresting her, he  said.    Kuetzing, a specialist in eminent domain law, said a private building manager  hired by the city to operate the motel decided Tuesday that Ochoa was  interfering in the operation of the building. Police were told to arrest Ochoa  if she tries to enter the building.    Ochoa was arrested Monday on suspicion of entering a building after being  banned from the site by court order, a misdemeanor violation, police said. She  was released on her own recognizance later that day, police said.    Ochoa and the city's Redevelopment Department have been engaged for several  months in a bitter dispute over the motel. The city contends that the motel is  the center of drug deals and prostitution and plans to demolish the aging  building to make way for a parking lot as part of a large downtown  redevelopment project.    Lt. Stan Myers said police consider the Lemon Tree Motel the center of drug  activity in downtown Oxnard.    ""It's no secret that the motel is a center for criminal activity,"" he said.    Police said they made seven arrests at the motel on Monday night. Most of the  arrests were drug-related, police said.    Ochoa denied that the tenants are involved in criminal activity and said city  officials have been engaged in a ""political conspiracy"" to demolish the motel.  She said the motel is one of the city's last sources of low-income housing.    Ochoa and several tenants said if the building is demolished many tenants will  be homeless. The city is required by law to find affordable housing for each  tenant before the motel is demolished.    Earlier this year, Ochoa filed for bankruptcy in an effort to delay the city  from taking possession of the motel. But in June a bankruptcy judge lifted the  stay and ruled that the city could take possession of the property.    Last week, a Ventura County Superior Court judge approved a request by the city  that allowed the city to remove and ban Ochoa from the building, Kuetzing said.    City officials have offered Ochoa $795,000 for the building but Ochoa has said  the amount is too low and has vowed to appeal the price in court. Kuetzing said  the matter may ultimately be decided by a jury.    Meanwhile, the city has hired Myers and Associates, a private management firm,  to run the motel until the city relocates all the tenants.    The city's redevelopment department has also ordered four Oxnard police  officers to patrol the motel to prevent any violence, Myers said.    Ochoa, however, said the officers, who have been stationed at the motel since  Monday afternoon, have been harassing the tenants. Arturo Munoz, 30, said he  was arrested Monday for drinking a beer in his room.    Myers said he was not sure what arrests have been made at the motel, but he  denied that tenants had been harassed.    Kuetzing said the city has the right to have police protect city property.    ""The city is the landlord and as landlord the city has the same right as any  other landlord,"" he said.    But Ochoa responded: ""The police shouldn't be involved in a civil matter. They  should be chasing criminals.""

The World Court yesterday rejected Libya's plea that it should bar the US and Britain from taking punitive measures to oblige Tripoli to hand over two men suspected of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland. The ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague coincided with last-minute attempts by the Arab League to head off the imposition of sanctions. A renewed Libyan offer to yield the two suspects to a 'neutral' party was expected to be dismissed by the Security Council. The White House said it was pleased with the World Court ruling. In rejecting Libya's plea, the judges of the court said that the Security Council Resolution 748 imposing sanctions should override all other international agreements. Libya defiantly isolated itself from the world yesterday by declaring a 'day of mourning' and cutting external air and telecommunications links. The national news agency Jana said the 'day of mourning' had nothing to do with the sanctions threat but was a mark of respect for the 37 Libyans who died in US bombing raids on Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986. 'The Arab people, in commemorating this anniversary, wants to reveal that this Arab nation is the victim every day of terrorism and abhorrent racism,' a statement issued by the Libyan embassy in Cairo said. Dr Esmat Abdel Meguid, the Arab League secretary-general, said that he hoped an offer by Malta to accept the two accused Libyans would help to defuse the crisis, but western officials said it was unlikely that the Security Council would delay the imposition of sanctions. The US and Britain are demanding the unconditional surrender of the two men suspected of planting a bomb on the airliner which exploded over Lockerbie killing 270 people. France is pressing Libya to grant it access to four Libyans, including Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's brother-in-law, for questioning over the 1989 downing of a French UTA airliner over Niger in which all 171 passengers and crew perished. Most Arab states indicated they would reluctantly fall into line with the air embargo, but both Egypt and Tunisia are planning to facilitate travel across their frontiers with Libya. Some 30 offices of Libyan Arab Airlines were expected to be closed worldwide and Libyan diplomatic representation will be thinned out under the terms of the UN resolution. The sanctions will not affect Libyan oil exports or shipping services.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "

There were 161 heroin cases in which  274 offenders--both Thais and foreigners--were arrested and a  total of 1,416 kg of heroin was seized. There were 43 marijuana  cases in which 54 offenders were arrested and 457 kg of  marijuana was seized. There were 11 opium cases involving 37  offenders and a total of 484 kg of opium. Police also arrested  37 suspects in 29 cases involving the sale of some 145,000  amphetamine tablets. Somchai said drug trafficking by  foreigners, especially from South Africa, has been declining  because of frequent arrests by police. He said it is now known  that there are no more production sources in Thailand; the  country is only used as transit route for trafficking by ethnic  minorities living along the Thai border. He confirmed that  large-scale suppression will continue.

In a letter sent by the IRA to some foreign-owned financial institutions in the City and published in Republican News, the IRA leadership says: 'No one should be misled into underestimating the seriousness of the IRA's intention to mount future planned attacks in the political and financial heart of the British state.' An official from the Hongkong  Shanghai Bank, which confirmed that a copy of the letter was sent to its Bishopsgate offices that were devastated by a terrorist bomb earlier this year, said: 'Our record shows we will not be influenced by this sort of propaganda. We've been in Lebanon since 1982 - something like this will not make us move out of London.' Mr Paul Hofer, regional head of Credit Suisse's northern Europe operations, said: 'We have total trust in the UK authorities. We were back one day after the last bomb.' Mr David Prosser, deputy managing director of Daiwa Bank (Capital Markets), said: 'We got bombed out of the Commercial Union building in the first bomb. It didn't stop us then and another one or maybe two bombs would not stop us now.' Deutsche Bank yesterday confirmed it had received a letter but declined to comment further. City of London Police confirmed that a number of overseas banks had received the letters and urged institutions to hand over the letters for forensic examination. Police experts are now studying the copies of the letter sent to Deutsche Bank and the Hongkong  Shanghai Bank. Responding to the continued threat to the City, the Foreign Banks and Securities Houses Association said its members were now putting more emphasis on security and welcomed tougher anti-terrorist measures such as the road check-points. Mr Ian Mckay, secretary of the association, which represents 150 overseas institutions, added: 'Our members will not be swayed by this attempt to destabilise London.' However, concern at the threat of a City bombing campaign yesterday prompted a Scandinavian securities house, which asked not to be named, to draw up contingency plans to leave the Square Mile. A senior official at the institution said it planned to install dealing room facilities in a building outside the City. The IRA's letter says: 'In the context of present political realities, further attacks on the City of London and elsewhere are inevitable. This we feel we are bound to convey to you directly, to allow you to make fully informed decisions'. No copies of the letter are thought to have been sent to US-owned institutions as the IRA is anxious not to alienate any republican sympathy in North America.

Still, no one could say why all of the major drug busts with  clear Trinidad and Tobago connections are taking place  everywhere--in Savannah, Georgia; Wilmington, North Carolina;  Frankfurt, Germany, and on Monday in Grenada--but here.    Repeated calls to National Security Minister Russell Huggins  and Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Chief Lance Selman went  unreturned up to late Friday.    Law enforcement sources said in both shipping  incidents--involving the methanol tanker Harold La  Borde and the schooner Let Me Live--local police  had prior knowledge that there were drugs on board. A combined  total of 134 kilograms of cocaine were seized from both vessels  in places outside Trinidad and Tobago.    The Ministry of National Security has gone a step further  and  rushed to take credit for the drug busts, citing collaboration  between local authorities and their foreign counterparts in an  official government press release.    Despite this, no one could say why, if information was  available that there were drugs on board the methanol tanker and  on the inter-island schooner, the bust was not made here by  local narcotics or Coast Guard officers, instead of allowing the  US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Grenada Coast  Guard to break those two smuggling operations.    In the case of the Harold La Borde the DEA gave  credit to a local informant who was paid ""good money"" by the US  counter-narcotics agency for supplying information that led to  the drug bust and the arrest of four Trinidadians.    Pierre Sharette, assistant special agent of the DEA Miami  office with responsibility for the Caribbean, told the SUNDAY  EXPRESS that month that the mystery Trinidadian had no  connection to law enforcement agencies.    Current bids for credit by local officials recall the  episode  two years ago when the Narcotics Bureau claimed credit for the  Florida arrest by US authorities of Paul Mansoor with five  kilograms of cocaine.    Vexed by the false claim, a US source later told this  newspaper that Mansoor was picked up in Miami because he was  acting suspicously, and not as a result of any tip-off from the  TT police.    Sources say that neither of the shipping incidents was a  ""controlled delivery""--the reason, some people believe, for the  failure of local authorities to act on the information here.    In the latest bust, local authorities said, they tipped off  the DEA, who in turn alerted the Grenada Coast Guard that drugs  were stashed in hidden compartments in furniture stored on the  schooner. Why local authorities did not themselves intercept the  drugs but allowed the ship to leave the Caricom jetty and sail  clear out of TT waters has not been explained.    A top policeman would say only that ""we were aware of it  (drugs on board the schooner)."" Pressed further, he said: ""The  information is very sensitive.""    He claimed that authorities here ""are aware of the local  connection"" in both drug runs. He added only that: ""We have an  idea what's going on (in the drug business).""    He refused to say why, if the authorities know who the local  dealers are, there have been no arrests as yet--or rather, the  arrests that have been made comprise mainly drug mules held on  outbound flights at Piarco International Airport and low-level  street dealers.    Earlier this month, a Trinidadian was arrested in Germany  with four kilograms of cocaine. He was a passenger on BWIA  flight 980--Port of Spain to Frankfurt.    Suspicions created since charges last year about a police  ""drug cartel"" have slowed the sharing of information even  between the newly created narcotics unit and Selman's OSS. Each  agency is reported to be guarding information jealously and  sharing it ""on a need to know basis only.""    There is no explanation either why there are no busts for  drugs coming into Trinidad and Tobago, or how much of  what comes in remains here.    Law enforcement authorities say they are unable to keep pace  with the sophisticated craft and ingenious methods employed by  traffickers and predict even tougher times ahead with the major  shift in US drug policy.    The Clinton administration announced it will slash drug  interdictions efforts using warships and aircraft in the  Caribbean and pump more aid to South America to fight cocaine at  the source.    Sharette had told the SUNDAY EXPRESS that Trinidad and  Tobago  is being used as a ""staging area"" by the Medellin and Cali  cartels to move drugs to Europe and North America.    Sharette said DEA intelligence indicates that single and  twin-engine aircraft have been making drug airdrops in Trinidad  and Tobago territorial waters. Boats pick up the drug cargo for  repackaging and shipping to Europe and North America.    Meanwhile, despite Huggins' vow to get tough, cocaine  cartels  continue to bring their drugs into Trinidad and Tobago and, as  evidenced by recent seizures and arrests, to take at least some  of it out.

0,FT923-13692 ,"FT923-13692 _AN-CGLAFADRFT 920711   FT  11 JUL 92 / Pan Am found guilty in Lockerbie bombing case      By NIKKI TAIT      NEW YORK   A US jury yesterday found Pan American World Airways guilty of wilful misconduct in a case filed by relatives of the victims killed in the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. Pan Am Flight 103 ended in disaster on December 21 1988, when a bomb hidden inside a portable cassette player tore the jet apart shortly after it left London for New York. All 259 people on board the Boeing 747, and 11 people on the ground, were killed. Yesterday's verdict comes after a civil trial lasting nearly 11 weeks in a Brooklyn federal court. The plaintiffs are seeking more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 157m) in damages from the airline and two subsidiaries, Pan American World Services and Alert Management. Under international treaties, liability damages are limited to Dollars 75,000 for each victim unless wilful negligence is proved. A second phase of the trial, to determine the amount of damages to be awarded, will now have to take place. No date for this has yet been scheduled. Pan Am, which stopped operating last year, is also thought likely to appeal against yesterday's verdict. Lawyers acting for Pan Am and its own legal department declined to make any immediate comment on the verdict. The case centred on how the bomb got on board the jet. The plaintiffs argued that the bomb had been placed in an unaccompanied suitcase, and put on an Air Malta flight to Frankfurt. This bag, they contended, was then improperly transferred to Flight 103 by a Pan Am employee. The employee, they contended, failed to examine the bag and note that it did not belong to anyone travelling on the flight. The defence argued that the bag was smuggled into the Pan Am system at Frankfurt, or even London, by terrorists. Lawyers said the plaintiffs were seeking 'private vengeance' against the carriers, which had no control over the disaster. The jury was also told that the airline had improved security measures in the months before the disaster. Pan Am, which had been losing money for many years, went into bankruptcy in January 1991, and ceased operating last December. Its affairs are still being wound up, but the airline's insurers would be liable for any damage award. Yesterday, Mr Tom Plaskett, who was in charge of Pan Am at the time of the Lockerbie bombing, claimed that the trial had 'failed to solve the mystery that is the Lockerbie disaster'. 'Much of what we do know with certainty about Lockerbie was not shared with this jury. . . We shall endeavour through the appeals process to shed some light on this uncertainty,' he said.

0,FT933-16038 ,"FT933-16038 _AN-DGFC3AD1FT 930706   FT  06 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Ring of anxiety   DISRUPTION TO business caused by the security cordon in the City of London was described as negligible yesterday. The first working day of anti-terrorist traffic restrictions in a small area of the capital's financial district failed to produce the threatened jams. Vital though it is to defeat terrorism, these measures do not look like part of a well-considered and coherent strategy for fighting the Irish Republican Army. The plan has been instituted at the request of the City Corporation, the local authority for the district. On two recent occasions, the IRA has planted large bombs, causing death, injury and hundreds of millions of pounds of damage. Two other attempts, involving large quantities of explosives, were thwarted outside the City's boundaries. The Corporation felt that action was needed to protect the City's position as an international financial centre. Further successful attacks would harm London's prospects in competing for financial businesses which might be tempted to relocate to other European cities The Corporation's security cordon has, however, given the terrorists a propaganda coup by so publicly interfering with commercial activities in the capital. In its mainland bombing campaign, the IRA's avowed aim is to prevent the British living life normally, so long as Northern Ireland remains part of the UK. By setting up roadblocks and police checkpoints in the City, the Corporation has provided compelling evidence of the success of the campaign. The strategy is also unlikely to deter bomb attacks in London, only a tiny part of which is covered by the cordon. A similar security ring in Belfast has had some success in protecting a small part of the city centre. But the bombers have simply shifted their attacks to targets elsewhere in Belfast and to other provincial towns. There is a grave danger that the City of London's security cordon will displace the terrorist attacks to other parts of the capital. Perhaps the most compelling argument against the security cordon is that once made permanent, it would be difficult to dismantle. Except in the unlikely event of the IRA publicly abandoning its mainland bombing campaign, the removal of the cordon would be seen as either an admission of failure or an invitation to the bombers to return. The City traffic restrictions have been imposed as part of a six-month pilot study, since legislation would be required to make them permanent. The Corporation should think hard before proceeding to this stage. It would be wise to spend the next six months thinking of less disruptive and potentially more effective ways of deploying the very substantial resources involved in manning the new security system. Draconian car-parking restrictions and more intense surveillance, of the kind used around Whitehall since the mortar attack on Downing Street, are options worth considering.

The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] militants were  reluctant to show the current situation of their camp to the  correspondents. They claimed, however, that only seven of their  colleagues were killed in the air attacks and noted: ""We are  not afraid of bombs. As you have observed, we are still here in  the camp.""    We reached the vicinity of the camp with great difficulty.  We arrived in an area that had many craters created by  exploding bombs. That area was 500 meters from the Zhalah Camp.  One of the PKK militants who blocked our way identified himself  as the person in charge of the camp. He claimed the Turkish  newspapers are being used as an tool, and said we could not  enter their camp. The correspondents said: ""If you claim the  Turkish Government is lying, then you should allow us to enter  to determine the true state of affairs."" However, the PKK  militants were determined not to allow us into their camp, which  had been destroyed by the military aircraft.    Two buildings close to the entrance of the camp seemed to be  intact. However, the main camp was hidden deep in the canyon.  The PKK militants refused to show us the results of the bombing  raids.    Although the PKK militants claimed that no damage was caused  to the camp, a resident of Shele village, which is near the  Zhalah Camp, said: ``The Turkish aircraft dropped many bombs.  It was like hell. Even Saddam Husayn was not bombed by the  United States to that extent. I saw buildings collapse."" He  also said he was in the camp when the Turkish aircraft attacked.    It has been ascertained that the bombing of the camp  frightened nearby villagers a lot. However, residential areas  and civilians around the camp were unharmed except for some  individuals who were smuggling contraband goods on mules. The  journalists did not observe any damage in the villages around  the camp.    The PKK militants claimed that the Turkish aircraft dropped  their bombs from an altitude of 20,000 meters [as published] to  stay out of range of their antiaircraft guns. They also claim  that they shot down two aircraft, but were unable to describe  exactly where they crashed or to provide any evidence to confirm  their claim.    Several Kurdish sources in northern Iraq have said: ""The PKK  militants have not been completely evicted. Although  significant damage has been caused in the camp, the PKK  militants are still there. However, they are demoralized. The  air attack was a very serious deterrent measure.""    It has been ascertained that one of the villagers who  transported goods from Iran to northern Iraq on mules was  injured. The air operation caused significant anxiety in  northern Iraq.

A statement from the command, forwarded to TANJUG from the  Srpska republic president's office stresses that: The attacks  on the Serbs were carried out in order to prevent the  realization of the Serb proposal on a complete and lasting  cessation of hostilities.    Noting that the Serb side was determined to persist in its  commitment to an immediate and lasting peace, but also to the  energetic defense of the Srpska republic and Serb national  interests, the supreme command stresses that the Serbs will not  be frightened and that they will keep the right to self-defense  with all available weapons.    The text of the statement by the supreme command of the  armed  forces of the Bosnian Srpska republic reads:    1. The supreme command of the Srpska republic armed forces  lodges a sharp protest with the United Nations over the bombing  of Serb territory. It is not true that UNPROFOR personnel were  in danger, and there is no justification for the use of NATO's  air force. By doing this, the United Nations has sided against  the Serbs in this civil war. Further cooperation of the Srpska  republic with UNPROFOR has been brought into question, and all  contacts between the Srpska republic and UNPROFOR are now  suspended.    2. The supreme command of the Bosnian Srpska republic's  armed forces is informing the international public about the  Serb proposal for a complete and lasting cessation of  hostilities. This proposal was not accepted by the Muslim side  and was not supported by UNPROFOR. By protecting the Muslim  offensive from defeat, the United Nations is prolonging the war  and suffering. The attack on the Serbs was carried out in order  to prevent the realization of the Serb proposal on a complete  and lasting cessation of hostilities.    3. The peace process has been put in jeopardy and the UN  bears the responsibility for it. The Serb side is determined to  persist in its commitment to an immediate and lasting peace, and  to the energetic defense of the Serb republic and Serb national  interests.    4. The soldiers of the Srpska republic are forced to choose  between being killed or responding to the offensive.  Politically motivated elements in NATO and the United Nations  are encouraging Muslim attacks against Serbs in order to take  the Serb response as a cause for military intervention. The  Serbs will not be frightened, and they will keep the right to  self-defense with all available weapons. This is said in the  statement by the supreme command of the armed forces of the  Srpska republic.     "

SERRANO, Times Staff Writers      SAN DIEGO      Agents investigating the method used in last week's bombing of a van driven by  the wife of Vincennes Capt. Will Rogers III have narrowed their suspicions to a  crude device that could have detonated the bomb with the van's own engine heat,  federal sources said Monday.    Authorities were still reluctant to link the bombing attack to terrorists, but  they confirmed Monday that they were checking reports from witnesses that men  acting suspiciously, who appeared to be Middle Eastern, were spotted near the  Rogerses' La Jolla home in recent weeks.      Retaliation Theory    Terrorism is considered a possibility because Iran pledged retaliation after  last summer's downing of a civilian Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf by  the missile cruiser Vincennes, which Rogers commands. Rogers gave the order to  shoot the plane down after mistaking it for an attacking Iranian fighter. The  downed plane carried 290 people to their deaths.    Last Friday's bombing is still being treated as ""suspected or possible  terrorism,"" an FBI official said, but other theories range all the way from one  or two Iranians acting on their own to disgruntled sailors from Rogers' ship.    ""What if you have one or two Iranians or other followers of the Ayatollah who  mount something on their own in response to the Ayatollah?"" said one source  close to the case in Washington. ""Or, what if you have disgruntled sailors on  the ship? Not any of this is being ruled out.""    It appears that no breakthrough is imminent, another source familiar with the  investigation said.    However, sources said investigators have come to suspect a heat-triggered  device after finding no obvious signs of a timer or other form of detonating  device. They said the explosion now appears to have been caused by one or two  pipe bombs placed under the van, directly below the driver's seat.      Possibility Wood Was Used    One source close to the investigation in San Diego said theories are centering  on the possibility that some type of light wood -- possibly balsa -- was  attached to the bomb and the van's undercarriage. When the motor heated, the  wood could have ignited and detonated the bomb.    He said the wood can be filed down to the size of a match stick or fuse, and  that it can be ""just taped"" to the explosive or engine.    ""It's been done in the past,"" he said. ""Apparently the CIA and terrorist groups  have used it in the past. The wood would get hot enough and burn and this would  be the ignitor.""    He also noted that no traces of the lightweight wood would be left after the  resulting explosion. Officials at the scene have found small fragments of a  plumber's pipe and end caps, but no clues as to the type of detonating device.    ""The bottom line on that is that the leads are zip,"" he said.    The Rogerses' van had been parked overnight in the front driveway. Rogers first  drove the van Friday morning to a doughnut shop about three-fourths of a mile  from the home. They said he parked the vehicle in front of the shop's door and  turned off the motor. Moments later, he returned home.    About a hour later, Sharon Rogers drove the van about 3 miles before the  explosion occurred as she was stopped at a traffic light in La Jolla. She  escaped unhurt after leaving the van to investigate what she thought was a bump  from behind. Moments after she got out, the van exploded in a fireball and  metal fragments tore through the vehicle.    The sources pointed out that the device detonated when she slowed to a stop and  the motor began to idle. Normally, an air-cooled engine would be cool as it was  being driven, then would heat up as it idled.    Investigators also were checking Monday on reports that as many as three Middle  Eastern-looking men were seen in the neighborhood asking for the location of  the Rogers home.    ""There were a couple of guys who asked a paper boy if there was a captain who  lived on the street,"" said one law enforcement official. ""But the kid had just  moved in there and didn't get much of a description of the men. It happened  about a week or two before"" Friday's bombing.    John Petrou, a 22-year-old neighbor who also spoke to the FBI, told The Times  that he saw two men he described as Middle Eastern-looking drive into the  Rogerses' cul-de-sac about two weeks before the bombing. Both acted suspicious,  Petrou said.    The first man reportedly was driving a gray BMW and drove by on a weekday  afternoon when Petrou was outside washing his car, and the second went by a few  days later in a Toyota.    ""Usually, people that drive through the neighborhood we all know,"" Petrou said.  ""But these were two guys in separate cars, of Arabic descent. . . . I was  watching them, but they didn't look at me. They didn't look in my face.""    But some officials downplayed the likelihood of the bombers surveying the  neighborhood looking for the home. They noted that Rogerses are listed in the  phone directory and that the home would be easy to find.    ""And nobody's told us for sure yet that this was an act of terrorism,"" one  source said.      Identity of Red Car    Officials also on Monday identified the make of the red car seen making a  U-turn and speeding from the bombing scene as a Dodge Omni and said that it had  been driving behind Sharon Rogers when the van exploded. They also said that as  many as four people were reported inside the red car.    ""Nobody got a license plate or anything like that,"" said one investigator. ""And  we don't know that that's a real connection. It could be somebody panicked when  this thing went off.""    Officials also elaborated on a telephone call taken by Sharon Rogers at home  shortly after the July incident in which her husband ordered the Iranian  jetliner shot down. The caller at that time asked if she was the ""murderer's  wife,"" then Sharon Rogers hung up.    Afterward, the Naval Intelligence Service placed a tap on her phone, but no  other frightening or threatening calls were received.    However, Sharon Rogers did receive a letter, officials said, which, while not  personally threatening, did discuss the Persian Gulf incident.    ""It was more of a 'How come these people had to die? Why did this happen?' but  it wasn't really threatening,"" said one source. ""And she turned it over to the  NIS, too.""      Navy Security Tight    Meanwhile, security remained tight at all San Diego area naval bases. At the  32nd Street Naval Station, where the Vincennes is docked, security personnel  checked identification of everyone entering. Sailors leaving the base said they  were told to be alert and report all suspicious occurrences or persons.    Two Vincennes crew members leaving the Navy exchange declined to discuss the  bombing. The two men said they had been advised that reporters might seek them  out.    ""We have to be careful what we say, since the FBI still doesn't know who did  this,"" said one young sailor.    Officials at Colgate University in upstate New York, where the Rogerses' son is  a student, said Monday they increased campus security after consulting over the  weekend with the FBI and naval intelligence. There have been no threats against  Will Rogers IV or any other students, according to Lee Pelton, dean of the  college.    Access to his residence hall has been limited and security at the campus main  gate has been tightened, he said. The school has 2,600 students, and ""is small  enough that visitors are noticed,"" Pelton said.    Times staff writers Jane Fritsch, Ralph Frammolino and H.G. Reza contributed to  this story from San Diego. Staff writer Ronald Ostrow reported from Washington.

The two men said they had been advised that reporters might seek them  out.    ""We have to be careful what we say, since the FBI still doesn't know who did  this,"" said one young sailor.    Officials at Colgate University in upstate New York, where the Rogerses' son is  a student, said Monday they increased campus security after consulting over the  weekend with the FBI and naval intelligence. There have been no threats against  Will Rogers IV or any other students, according to Lee Pelton, dean of the  college.    Access to his residence hall has been limited and security at the campus main  gate has been tightened, he said. The school has 2,600 students, and ""is small  enough that visitors are noticed,"" Pelton said.    Times staff writers Jane Fritsch, Ralph Frammolino and H.G.

0," LA052090-0171   221753    May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition      Westside; Part J; Page 1; Column 5      2007 words      THE BOYS OF THE BOULEVARD      By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      It was midnight, and the driver of the late-model blue Mercedes had spent a few  minutes cruising Santa Monica Boulevard before pulling up near one of several  young male prostitutes beckoning from the curbside.    The youth leaned into the car, his face just inches away from that of the  middle-aged driver. A moment later, he scurried around to the passenger side,  hopped in, and the sedan slid off into the night.    The scenario would be repeated many other times that night along a stretch of  the boulevard that runs from the eastern fringes of West Hollywood well into  Hollywood, and on other nights and days as well.    It is happening so often these days, in fact, that residents and merchants are  up in arms, and police are sending vice reinforcements to the area to combat  what they say is a rising incidence of male prostitution.    For years, it was the female prostitution trade flourishing along Hollywood and  Sunset boulevards that disrupted the business community and residential  neighborhoods, and heavily taxed law enforcement efforts.    But now, Hollywood vice officers say, male prostitution has become a far worse  blight. Even more worrisome, they say, are the public health implications,  because male prostitutes are far more likely to be infected with the AIDS  virus, and because some unsafe homosexual sex practices are far more likely  than heterosexual encounters to transmit the virus.    Authorities and social service agencies estimate that as many as one in four  male prostitutes are already carrying the AIDS virus. And they say a sizable  percentage of the male prostitutes add to the AIDS risk by being drug abusers,  sometimes injecting drugs with shared needles.    ""I think they are signing some death warrants,"" said Lt. Peter Durham, head of  the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood vice unit. ""It scares the hell  out of me, and it scares the hell out of my men.""    Many of Durham's men fear arresting male prostitutes, who they say bite,  scratch and spit at them. ""One officer was bitten, and the guy said, 'I've got  AIDS and I hope you die,' "" Durham said. He said the deputy had to undergo  monthly tests for the AIDS virus.    Durham stressed that prosecution of male prostitutes ""is not a gay issue"" and  that most prostitutes he has encountered say they are not homosexual.    Many of the prostitutes are young runaways, looking for quick food and drug  money and a way off the harsh streets of Hollywood, even if just for the night  or a few hours.    ""I quit last year,"" said Dave, 18, ""because I got tired of having middle-aged  men looking at me like I was a piece of garbage, and having to sleep with them  just for a place to stay.""    Dave, who said he worked the streets through most of his teens, has seen the  number of male prostitutes rise and fall with the seasons, sporadic police  enforcement efforts and other factors. One constant, he said, was that the male  prostitutes show few, if any, signs of practicing safe sex.    ""These are kids who are self-destructive. They are committing a slow suicide  out there,"" said Ann Donahue, executive director of Covenant House California,  a shelter for runaway and homeless youth.    ""It seems amazing to me that in the era of AIDS there are johns willing to pick  up these kids knowing what a high risk they are,"" Donahue said. ""And yet they  still do. It doesn't seem to have abated in any way.""    In fact, added Jack Allen, who coordinates the street outreach program for the  Gay and Lesbian Community Service Center, many customers are willing to pay a  prostitute more for engaging in unsafe sex practices, such as forgoing a  condom.    Allen spends a few hours a day talking to the prostitutes, trying to direct  them to shelters, job training programs and medical centers and giving them  free condoms and bleach for their needles.    ""It is really frightening when you think about it, the rate of the disease  spreading in this particular population,"" he said.    A recently passed state law requires that anyone convicted of prostitution be  tested for the AIDS virus. They must be notified if they test positive, and any  further arrests for prostitution are prosecuted as felonies, said Durham, the  LAPD vice unit chief.    Nonetheless, police keep arresting the prostitutes, and they keep returning to  the streets, often within hours. ""It is a society problem, and I don't see a  police solution,"" Durham said.    That has not stopped police from trying. On a recent sweep, LAPD officers  arrested more than 60 prostitutes, the vast majority of them men. And more  enforcement efforts are in the works, Durham said.    ""(Prostitution) is up currently on Santa Monica (Boulevard), and I don't have a  real good reason for it,"" Durham said last week. ""There is no doubt about it.""    According to LAPD statistics, the Hollywood area has had more prostitution  arrests, male and female, than any other part of the city this year.    Sgt. John Fletcher, in the LAPD's citywide vice enforcement office, said the  four worst city areas for prostitution are Hollywood, MacArthur Park, the  Newton Division south of downtown and the Figueroa Street corridor.    In Hollywood, police made 117 prostitution-related arrests in March, the most  recent month for which figures are available. The total was 443 for the first  three months of the year. (They do not break down prostitution arrests by sex.)  Last year they made 431 prostitution-related arrests through March, and 1,975  arrests the entire year.    In preparation for what he expects to be a very busy summer, Durham said he is  diverting many of his vice officers down to Santa Monica Boulevard, even though  the hot weather also is bringing out more female prostitutes. With the gamut of  other vice-related offenses occurring around the clock in Hollywood, his  enforcement teams will be stretched very thin, Durham said.    One explanation for the increase in activity in Hollywood is that many of the  male prostitutes have moved eastward as a result of a crackdown in West  Hollywood earlier this year. An all-night hamburger stand there that was a  haven for drug dealing and prostitution was shut down as a nuisance. And the  city of West Hollywood evicted a free-meal program from Plummer Park and banned  sleeping in the park.    ""They have to find greener pastures, I guess you'd call it,"" said Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Sgt. H. Snyder at the West Hollywood sheriff's substation.  Deputies, who provide police services to West Hollywood, still arrest about 20  male prostitutes a week, he said.    Snyder estimated that there are several thousand male prostitutes in Los  Angeles and that many roam back and forth between West Hollywood and Hollywood.  That way, when they become too familiar to police and judges in Los Angeles,  they can move across the city line and start over with a new police force and  new judicial system.    ""You can literally stand there and watch them troop across from Hollywood into  West Hollywood to work the streets,"" said Edward Riney, a member of the Eastend  Community Action group and the West Hollywood Crime Task Force.    While Riney and dozens of other residents held a rally last Saturday night to  call for increased police action, about 18 male prostitutes loitered on the  opposite street corner. Some of them cursed the residents; others watched out  of curiosity and indifference.    On several recent nights, patrol cars seemed to be everywhere on and around  Santa Monica Boulevard. But the instant they passed, male prostitutes would  emerge from the shadows, from behind bus benches or alleys, or from side  streets and go back to their preferred waiting spots. Many never even bothered  to hide their street-walking activity.    It is that brazenness that has irritated the merchants along the popular  thoroughfare and the residents on the side streets.    ""It's totally out of hand,"" said Maxine Weinman, owner of Maxine's Seafood Cafe  in a mini-mall at Santa Monica and Highland Avenue. Weinman said a dozen or so  male prostitutes work out of the parking lot and a nearby doughnut shop day and  night.    ""They have made it their little home. They hang out in front of it, on the side  of it, in the parking lot,"" Weinman said. ""They have hurt my business -- there  is no question about it. And they accost my customers, who don't want to get  out of their cars.""    Things have gotten so bad at that corner that the property owner hired a  security guard, Mario Vasquez. Attired in a snappy black-and-white uniform, but  without a gun, Vasquez on a recent afternoon was poking around the parking lot,  looking for loiterers.    Speaking mostly in Spanish, Vasquez said he is afraid of male prostitutes  because they fight him when he tries to force them off the property. ""Sometimes  my job is difficult,"" he said, displaying a knife wound and saying a male  prostitute had slashed him. ""Even in the afternoon it is terrible -- a lot of  people come looking for the prostitutes.""    Weinman and others say that a security guard and heightened police presence in  the area are useless and that even the countless arrests don't help.    ""The jails are overcrowded now, so they pay their fines and they're right back  out on the street,"" Weinman said. ""I don't know who to complain to at this  point.""    William Hasley and residents of Curson Avenue are complaining to police.    On Curson just north of Hollywood Boulevard is a row of million-dollar homes  that has become a popular spot for the prostitutes to bring customers. Hasley  and 40 other residents met with Durham one night last week to express their  anger and concern.    ""I've been walking my dog, and they'll be going at it right there in the car,  day or night,"" said Hasley. ""I rap on the window and a businessman looks up  like he's having a heart attack. . . . But (such intervention) could get  dangerous. One of them could have a gun.""    Durham said his officers have arrested 24 people on Curson recently, mostly  males. He said he sympathized with the residents.    ""I don't know about you, but if that was happening in my neighborhood I'd be  mad as hell. How do explain to your kids what those two people in the car are  doing to each other, whatever it is they are doing?""    For the most part, merchants and residents praise the police for their efforts.  But Durham told the Curson crowd what police have been telling residents for  years when they complain about prostitution: that authorities depend on  organized watch groups to call them when illegal activity is spotted.    Merchants along Sunset and Hollywood boulevards even chipped in a few years ago  to buy police a computer to keep track of female prostitutes so their rap  sheets could be accessed immediately. Otherwise, those using aliases often  escaped the harsher sentences given to repeat offenders.    Now the computer has 15,000 names in it, Durham said, adding that police  efforts to clean up female prostitution were aided by the opening of a  Hollywood division of Municipal Court and by pressuring motels to stop offering  rooms at hourly rates.    Durham remembers being a Hollywood vice officer in 1980 and spotting 175  prostitutes one night on a stretch of boulevard between Normandie Avenue and  Crescent Heights Boulevard. ""I'll buy you a steak dinner,"" he said, ""if you go  down there today and see 20 whores.""    The female prostitutes are still around, but are a much less visible and  chronic problem. Increasingly, Durham said, they are traveling to Las Vegas  when there is a big-ticket fight or other event, and even to Hawaii, taking  advantage of low air fares and the booming tourist business there.    Some residents say the confrontational nature of the male prostitutes and their  mobility will require more cooperation between city and county officials.    A few years back, police cleaned up a male prostitution problem on Santa Monica  Boulevard with help from Weinman and other concerned merchants.    ""Now there is just a total infestation of them again,"" Weinman said. ""They've  got to find some way to put these people in jail. The problem is they all know  they can get away with it, and that I am helpless.""

0," LA012190-0181   165221    January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 1; Column 3; Metro Desk      1713 words      L.A.'S ARSON SQUAD FIGHTS UNEVEN BATTLE      By PAUL FELDMAN and LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      Long before the embers had cooled in the $25-million Wilshire Corridor fire, a  dozen city and federal arson investigators armed with sophisticated hydrocarbon  detectors had arrived at the scene to determine where and how the spectacular  blaze began.    In short order, the team was able to declare that last month's conflagration,  which forced 150 people from their luxury condominiums and homes, had been  deliberately set, probably with gasoline.    Yet the chances of catching those responsible -- as in most arson fires in Los  Angeles and elsewhere across the country -- are slim.    Arson is one of the costliest crimes, experts say, but one of the easiest to  get away with.    Nationwide, arrests were made in only 15% of all 1988 arson cases, according to  the FBI.    In Los Angeles last year, arrests were made in 21% of the cases investigated by  the arson team. However, because some are minor and the department's resources  are limited, the team investigated only about one-third of the fires found to  have been deliberately set. In all, 288 arrests were made in more than 7,000  cases of arson or other fires of suspicious origin in Los Angeles.    ""The frustration inside arson units becomes palpable at times,"" said Alex A.  Ahart, executive secretary of the International Assn. of Arson Investigators.  ""Not to sound flip, but arson is the first and only crime in the books where  you've first got to able to prove that God didn't do it.    ""Arson is a prosecuting attorney's nightmare because he (usually) doesn't have  the eyewitnesses, the fingerprints or the smoking gun.""    Time and again, suspects in high-profile Los Angeles blazes were freed shortly  after being arrested because of a lack of clear-cut evidence. That happened  after fires that devastated the Los Angeles Public Library and the Pan Pacific  Auditorium during the late 1980s, as well as in the blaze earlier this month  that destroyed a partially completed Los Feliz condominium complex    Since so many cases go unprosecuted, some fire officials voice frustration with  the district attorney's office, which they say has traditionally been hesitant  to handle arson prosecutions built on circumstantial evidence. Prosecutors, for  their part, say they are stymied by the lack of hard evidence. Defense  attorneys, meanwhile, are frustrated by the arrest of clients on what they  contend are wild, misguided stabs at winning confessions.    In addition, some critics within the Los Angeles Fire Department question  whether its 19-member arson team can do an adequate job in a city of 3.4  million people, where annual fire losses frequently exceed $100 million. They  also complain that department officials have not been forceful enough in  seeking additional manpower during city budget deliberations.    Others, outside the department, have raised similar questions.    ""I don't see how the guys (in Los Angeles) have enough time to do a good  investigation on every fire,"" said Ahart, whose organization of arson  investigators has 7,600 members nationwide. ""You can only stretch yourself so  thin.""    By way of comparison, San Francisco, with a population of 731,700 people, has a  15-member arson task force; Houston, with a population of 1.7 million people,  has 60 arson investigators, and New York City, with a population of 7.3 million  people, has more than 200 arson team members.    In several interviews, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Lon Pursell  insisted that the city's current manpower level is sufficient. But on Friday,  Assistant Fire Chief Tony Ennis acknowledged, ""No, we do not have enough people  in the arson squad.    ""It would be beneficial to the department and the city,"" Ennis added, ""if we  could add, on an annual basis, another body or two.""    At the heart of any debate about arson is the unique nature of the crime.  Unlike with other offenses, experts first must determine whether a crime has  actually occurred.    ""If you have a burglary, you're probably missing your TV. If you were robbed,  you're probably missing your wallet and that's known right away,"" said the  city's senior arson investigator, William S. Cass.    But when a fire breaks out, Cass said, arson experts must sift through  mountains of blackened rubble to determine whether it was a frayed wire or a  Molotov cocktail that was to blame.    With much of the evidence reduced to ashes -- and most such fires occurring in  the dark of night, without witnesses -- the most arson investigators can  generally hope for is a singed fingerprint, a bit of genetic material or the  charred remains of a gasoline can that can be directly linked to a suspect.    In recent years, the science of determining arson has advanced significantly.  When a major fire occurs now, the city's arson squad is assisted by a high-tech  mobile unit operated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The  lab on wheels serves as headquarters for four specially trained chemists and  explosives technicians who sift through rubble in search of characteristic burn  patterns and residues left from incendiary materials. With its increasingly  sophisticated equipment and resources, the city's arson squad usually can  determine what caused a blaze in anywhere from two days to two weeks.    But the trail frequently ends there.    ""Once you have proved that a fire is of incendiary origin, then you have the  task of tying it to someone,"" explained Calvin E. Wells, an instructor in arson  science and chief fire investigator for the Pasadena Fire Department. ""That  takes us into the area of motivation, and that is where the confusion starts.""    In arson, the motives are often far less recognizable than in many other major  crimes. Fires are deliberately set for spite, for profit, for juvenile thrills  or to cover up other crimes such as burglary or murder.    In recent years in Los Angeles, no arrests have been made in several cause  celebre arson cases. Two examples: the Westwood condominium blaze last month  and the Wilshire District office tower fire last March that severely damaged  the state Department of Savings and Loan headquarters    In several other high-publicity Los Angeles cases, arrests were made, only to  have the suspects freed within days.    A prime example is what happened to Harry Peak, the garrulous unemployed actor  arrested by the city arson team as the culprit in the 1986 Los Angeles Public  Library fire.    At the time, Peak, who reportedly had given conflicting stories about his  presence at the fire to friends, was publicly identified by Fire Battalion  Chief Dean Cathey as ""the perpetrator."" But three days later, Peak was freed  when the district attorney's office, citing a lack of sufficient evidence,  declined to prosecute the 28-year-old Hollywood man.    After Peak was let go, recriminations flew.    Cathey continued to insist that Peak had set the $22-million blaze. But Deputy  Dist. Atty. Stephen Kay, concerned that his office was receiving a black eye  from the Fire Department, told reporters that the arson investigators arrested  Peak as ""a last straw"" in the hope that he would break down and confess to the  arson.    ""They told us that their investigation had reached a dead end,"" Kay said, ""that  they didn't have enough evidence to file a case.""    Peak, who called a lawyer rather than confessing, has since filed a $15-million  lawsuit against fire officials for false arrest and slander. The city,  meanwhile, has filed a $23-million cross-complaint against Peak, insisting that  he was still considered responsible for the devastating blaze.    In the Pan Pacific Auditorium fire last year, a transient was picked up and  declared the arsonist. But he too was released due to a lack of evidence.    In declining the case, the district attorney's office accused fire  investigators of ""jumping the gun."" Fire officials, meanwhile, blamed the staff  of politically embattled Mayor Tom Bradley for pressuring them to go forward  with a hastily scheduled press conference to announce that the case had been  solved.    ""If he says he did it and he is in good shape mentally, that's probably enough  information to arrest him,"" the suspect's attorney, Albert Gordon, reflected  last week. ""But if he says he did it and he's a fruitcake -- he's mentally ill  -- you have to be very careful . . . you kind of investigate him further.""    Again last week, a transient was detained shortly after a suspicious fire  destroyed a two-story condominium project under construction in the Los Feliz  area. And again, the man was released a few hours later.    Defending the series of spurious arrests, senior arson investigator Cass said  that fire officials have little choice but to follow whatever leads they have,  even when they turn up transients or mentally unstable individuals. ""It would  be in error if you did not pursue that individual, detain that individual and  find out as much as you could . . . and then make your decision.""    Cass also acknowledged that many arson cases, particularly those involving  transients, are bound to make prosecutors more skittish than normal about  filing charges.    ""That hesitancy is based on a lack of knowledge about the crime itself and  maybe their not wanting to get involved in what could be a complex,  circumstantial case,"" Cass said. Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert E. Savitt, who  specializes in arson prosecutions, admitted that arson cases often ""frighten  prosecutors.""    ""I understand the reticence and reluctance of prosecutors to go to court when  they don't have eyewitnesses to the actual fire or an admissible confession, if  there is a confession,"" Savitt said. ""Of course, if there is a confession, it's  very simple.""    But Fire Department critics question whether the arson team has the manpower to  adequately follow up most cases with the painstaking investigations necessary  to capture and prosecute the right suspect.    At times, investigators feel overwhelmed by the heavy caseload. ""It's like a  triage (medical) team deciding who lives and who dies,"" said one source  familiar with the team's operations.    Without question, said Ahart of the arson investigators' association, the Los  Angeles arson unit should be expanded.    ""How can 19 people cover 3 million people?"" he asked. ""I bleed for the guys who  are arson investigators in Los Angeles.""    Times staff writer John Johnson contributed to this story.      INVESTIGATIONS; ARSON -- LOS ANGELES; FIRES -- LOS ANGELES; CRIME STATISTICS    "," LA012190-0181   165221    January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 1; Column 3; Metro Desk      1713 words      L.A.'S ARSON SQUAD FIGHTS UNEVEN BATTLE      By PAUL FELDMAN and LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      Long before the embers had cooled in the $25-million Wilshire Corridor fire, a  dozen city and federal arson investigators armed with sophisticated hydrocarbon  detectors had arrived at the scene to determine where and how the spectacular  blaze began.    In short order, the team was able to declare that last month's conflagration,  which forced 150 people from their luxury condominiums and homes, had been  deliberately set, probably with gasoline.    Yet the chances of catching those responsible -- as in most arson fires in Los  Angeles and elsewhere across the country -- are slim.    Arson is one of the costliest crimes, experts say, but one of the easiest to  get away with.    Nationwide, arrests were made in only 15% of all 1988 arson cases, according to  the FBI.    In Los Angeles last year, arrests were made in 21% of the cases investigated by  the arson team. However, because some are minor and the department's resources  are limited, the team investigated only about one-third of the fires found to  have been deliberately set. In all, 288 arrests were made in more than 7,000  cases of arson or other fires of suspicious origin in Los Angeles.    ""The frustration inside arson units becomes palpable at times,"" said Alex A.  Ahart, executive secretary of the International Assn. of Arson Investigators.  ""Not to sound flip, but arson is the first and only crime in the books where  you've first got to able to prove that God didn't do it.    ""Arson is a prosecuting attorney's nightmare because he (usually) doesn't have  the eyewitnesses, the fingerprints or the smoking gun.""    Time and again, suspects in high-profile Los Angeles blazes were freed shortly  after being arrested because of a lack of clear-cut evidence. That happened  after fires that devastated the Los Angeles Public Library and the Pan Pacific  Auditorium during the late 1980s, as well as in the blaze earlier this month  that destroyed a partially completed Los Feliz condominium complex    Since so many cases go unprosecuted, some fire officials voice frustration with  the district attorney's office, which they say has traditionally been hesitant  to handle arson prosecutions built on circumstantial evidence. Prosecutors, for  their part, say they are stymied by the lack of hard evidence. Defense  attorneys, meanwhile, are frustrated by the arrest of clients on what they  contend are wild, misguided stabs at winning confessions.    In addition, some critics within the Los Angeles Fire Department question  whether its 19-member arson team can do an adequate job in a city of 3.4  million people, where annual fire losses frequently exceed $100 million. They  also complain that department officials have not been forceful enough in  seeking additional manpower during city budget deliberations.    Others, outside the department, have raised similar questions.    ""I don't see how the guys (in Los Angeles) have enough time to do a good  investigation on every fire,"" said Ahart, whose organization of arson  investigators has 7,600 members nationwide. ""You can only stretch yourself so  thin.""    By way of comparison, San Francisco, with a population of 731,700 people, has a  15-member arson task force; Houston, with a population of 1.7 million people,  has 60 arson investigators, and New York City, with a population of 7.3 million  people, has more than 200 arson team members.    In several interviews, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Lon Pursell  insisted that the city's current manpower level is sufficient. But on Friday,  Assistant Fire Chief Tony Ennis acknowledged, ""No, we do not have enough people  in the arson squad.    ""It would be beneficial to the department and the city,"" Ennis added, ""if we  could add, on an annual basis, another body or two.""    At the heart of any debate about arson is the unique nature of the crime.  Unlike with other offenses, experts first must determine whether a crime has  actually occurred.    ""If you have a burglary, you're probably missing your TV. If you were robbed,  you're probably missing your wallet and that's known right away,"" said the  city's senior arson investigator, William S. Cass.    But when a fire breaks out, Cass said, arson experts must sift through  mountains of blackened rubble to determine whether it was a frayed wire or a  Molotov cocktail that was to blame.    With much of the evidence reduced to ashes -- and most such fires occurring in  the dark of night, without witnesses -- the most arson investigators can  generally hope for is a singed fingerprint, a bit of genetic material or the  charred remains of a gasoline can that can be directly linked to a suspect.    In recent years, the science of determining arson has advanced significantly.  When a major fire occurs now, the city's arson squad is assisted by a high-tech  mobile unit operated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The  lab on wheels serves as headquarters for four specially trained chemists and  explosives technicians who sift through rubble in search of characteristic burn  patterns and residues left from incendiary materials. With its increasingly  sophisticated equipment and resources, the city's arson squad usually can  determine what caused a blaze in anywhere from two days to two weeks.    But the trail frequently ends there.    ""Once you have proved that a fire is of incendiary origin, then you have the  task of tying it to someone,"" explained Calvin E. Wells, an instructor in arson  science and chief fire investigator for the Pasadena Fire Department. ""That  takes us into the area of motivation, and that is where the confusion starts.""

0,FT934-12408 ,"FT934-12408 _AN-DJ0CNABOFT 931027   FT  27 OCT 93 / Major to discuss Ulster peace move      By KEVIN BROWN and TIM COONE      LONDON   THE Hume-Adams proposals for peace in Northern Ireland will be discussed on Friday by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, it emerged yesterday. The meeting was confirmed against a background of rising violence in Belfast in the wake of Saturday's IRA bombing in the Protestant Shankill Road, which killed 10 people. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he expected both prime ministers to give the Hume-Adams initiative 'very serious attention on Friday to see where the process can go from here'. But Mr Major's determination not to alienate the Ulster Unionist party was last night reflected by signs at Westminster that the government was now ready to back unionist demands for the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee. The prime minister has denied that he did a deal with the Ulster Unionists to avoid a Commons defeat in a confidence debate on the Maastricht treaty earlier this year. But with the tacit backing of Downing Street, the Commons procedure committee is expected today to give a positive response to demands for a select committee. Such a move would represent a clear signal of the government's commitment to ensure that any settlement in the province would have to secure the whole-hearted backing of the protestant community. Extra troops and police were moved to Belfast from elsewhere in Northern Ireland yesterday after two Roman Catholics were killed and six wounded in two separate incidents. Mr Major told the Commons the perpetrators of this week's terrorist attacks would be 'hunted down and subjected to the full severity of the law'. However, the government ruled out the reintroduction of internment. Sir John Wheeler, the Northern Ireland security minister, said there were 'no simple, easy solutions'. Downing Street continued to distance itself from the peace proposals put forward by Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA. Officials said Mr Major was willing to talk to Mr Reynolds, but was more interested in reviving the stalled 'three-strand' talks under the auspices of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. In an indication of the sensitivity with which the issue is regarded in London, Downing Street said neither Mr Major nor Mr Reynolds had asked for a bilateral meeting in Brussels. British officials said the Brussels summit offered a 'useful opportunity' for a meeting, but stressed that there was no formal agenda. Downing Street also continued to maintain that Mr Major had not seen the Hume-Adams proposals, and was unaware of the details of the initiative. Irish officials said the Shankill Road bombing had 'seriously damaged' the Hume-Adams initiative, but Dublin appeared keen to keep the proposals alive. Mr Spring said the two governments had an 'obligation' to look at 'any opportunities' to bring about peace in Northern Ireland 'despite the (IRA) atrocity of last weekend'.

These measures should include the following:    1. The results of the investigation into the al-Sayfi  [Phalangist Party headquarters] bombing must be made public and  if evidence and suspects are available, they must be tried by a  military tribunal and executed on the spot.    2. The same measures must be applied without hesitation  against the recently apprehended pro-Israeli gangs. According  to reports, the Army intelligence service recently uncovered and  arrested such groups.    3. A request must be submitted to the French Government to  hand over the individuals suspected of attempting to assassinate  President Ilyas al-Hirawi. According to our information, these  individuals possess much information and command dangerous  groups hostile to the country's security.    4. The country's various intelligence services must be  purged of all individuals guilty of corruption, favoritism,  illegal means of amassing wealth, and negligence. Such people  must dismissed. All intelligence services must be placed under  one unified command so that it will be possible to remedy the  current chaos in these services, as illustrated by the fact that  escort services for VIP's and their motorcades are more  important than the citizens' security.    5. A media law must be passed, unhindered by democratic  formalities, with the aim of stopping some television and radio  stations from broadcasting incitements. These media must be  deterred and closed down.    As for the weepy statements full of political theorizing  aimed at linking the church massacre with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, they are neither useful nor convincing.    While it is true that Israel is the first beneficiary of  such  incidents, it also has well-known agents in the country. This  morbid thing must be excised from the national body before the  sickness spreads and remedy becomes impossible. Israel, in the  final reckoning, does not need to cover up its crime. Just  listen to the still-inciteful statements by the Zionist entity's  leaders. For example, the so-called man of peace Shim'on Peres  refuses to disarm the settlers, wagers on Rabin's downfall, and  represents the Zionist army's and Zionist entity's hardline  wing. The measures Israel has adopted are limited to the  temporary arrest of five settlers.    The Hebron massacre is the start of a major series of crimes  aimed at expelling the Palestinians from the West Bank and  bringing in more Jews from the former Soviet Union and other  countries. Recently they informed us that one million Indian  Jews might be brought to Palestine. Hence, the peace  negotiations, stillborn to begin with, were buried by the Hebron  crime.    We fear that some of the advocates of partition, federalism,  so-called civilized pluralism, and extensive decentralization in  Lebanon will return to their schemes, bombing churches today and  mosques or other places of worship tomorrow with the help of the  Israelis.

Although no group immediately claimed responsibility, U.S. and Philippine  officials said the ambush appeared to be the work of the Communist New People's  Army, which has killed four Americans here in the last two years.    U.S. officials confirmed that they had received threats from the NPA that  Americans would be attacked if Quayle came to Manila.      Demonstrators Chant    About 200 demonstrators chanted ""Yankee Go Home"" and burned a large American  flag as Quayle's motorcade sped away from Ninoy Aquino International Airport,  where he arrived at 7:30 p.m. The protesters demanded an end to U.S. military  bases in the Philippines.    Security officials were bracing for large demonstrations and possible violence  today as Quayle begins the formal part of his 40-hour visit to the Philippines  with a call on President Corazon Aquino at Malacanang Palace.    Quayle is expected to give Aquino a letter from President Bush formally asking  for the opening of negotiations on the future of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay  Naval Base, America's largest overseas military installations, as well as four  smaller facilities. U.S. officials said the letter proposes no specific terms.    The bases issue is increasingly divisive here. The Pentagon considers them  vital to protecting Pacific sea lanes, but many Philippine leaders regard them  as a reminder of the nation's colonial ties and an affront to national  sovereignty.    The current bases agreement expires in September, 1991. Any new agreement must  be ratified by the 23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to the bases  is strong. Other officials have called for phasing out the bases in five to 10  years.      Dead Americans Identified    The two Americans killed Tuesday were identified as William H. Thompson, 45,  and Donald G. Buchner, 44. Officials said both had retired from the Air Force  and were technicians for Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp., a Pentagon  contractor at Camp O'Donnell, about 60 miles north of Manila.    Officials said Camp O'Donnell is an Air Force communications facility with 135  employees. They help operate an electronic warfare and bombing range at Clark's  sprawling Crowe Valley training facility.    In Washington, a State Department spokesman called the killings ""senseless and  cowardly.""    Susan M. Pearce, a vice president at the headquarters of Ford Aerospace Corp.  in Newport Beach, said the company has ""maintained good relations with the  local Philippine community"" and ""there is no apparent motive for this attack.""    The two victims, both married with children, were among 85 Ford Aerospace  workers at Camp O'Donnell, Pearce said. She added that there has never been ""a  prior incident of this kind involving our personnel.""    Air Force Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark, said early today that  military personnel and Defense Department employees in the Philippines ""are  being advised to avoid non-essential travel between facilities until further  notice."" The U.S. military television network later announced that Camp  O'Donnell personnel should not report for work today.    Nearly 40,000 U.S. troops, military dependents and civilian employees are  stationed at the two bases, which employ 68,000 Filipinos.    A police spokesman said the two Americans were ambushed at 4:40 p.m. Tuesday  about 12 miles north of Clark Air Base on a rural highway that connects Camp  O'Donnell with the town of Capas in Tarlac province.    The Capas police chief, Lt. Pepito Pimentel, said Thompson was driving a Toyota  Corolla, with Buchner beside him, when a large truck suddenly blocked the road.  Pimentel said six men armed with M-16 and M-14 rifles opened fire on the  Americans, riddling them with bullets.      69 Spent Cartridges Found    ""We found 69 spent cartridges at the ambush site,"" Pimentel said.    The bodies were taken to Clark by ambulance.    ""I think there's no doubt it's the NPA,"" a military officer said early today.  He speculated that the killers were part of the Central Luzon Regional  Commission, an New People's Army guerrilla group that killed two U.S. Air Force  enlisted men and an American civilian outside Clark on Oct. 28, 1987.    Five months ago, on April 21, U.S. Army Col. James (Nick) Rowe, a  counterinsurgency expert, was ambushed and killed in the Manila suburb of  Quezon City as he was being driven to his office at the U.S. Joint Military  Assistance Group.    The NPA said later that it had killed Rowe, 51, a decorated Vietnam veteran and  former prisoner of war, because of his involvement in the Philippine  government's ""total war"" against the rebels.    Two weeks earlier, guerrillas blew up a communications facility operated by the  U.S. Air Force and Navy and the Philippine military near Baguio in northern  Luzon. No one was injured.    Tuesday's ambush came after a week of arrests and demonstrations outside the  U.S. Embassy, a series of shootings and grenade attacks in Manila and a barrage  of anti-American press reports over alleged meddling in Philippine affairs.    Early Tuesday, unidentified gunmen shot and killed a staff officer of President  Aquino's security command about a mile from the presidential palace. He was the  fourth member of the presidential guard killed in the last four months.  Military officials have blamed urban Communist guerrillas -- known as  ""sparrows"" for their swiftness -- for the attacks.    Later Tuesday, 10 students were arrested after demonstrators protesting  Quayle's visit and rising tuition fees tossed a small homemade bomb at riot  police on a street across the Pasig River from the presidential palace. Six  police officers were injured.    Manila police and military units have been on the alert for the past two weeks,  since three grenade explosions killed two people and wounded 16 others.  Although the attacks remain unsolved, the blasts fueled new coup rumors and  increased tension.    As Quayle arrived in Manila, leftist student groups chanted ""Bases out!"" and  ""Quayle go home!"" from behind lines of helmeted riot police at the airport  entrance. Three youths wearing red bandannas over their faces set fire to a  tattered U.S. flag hung on a pole. Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, were probably  unable to see the blaze as their car sped by.    ""We are against the visit of Vice President Quayle because it is symbolic of  further intervention by the U.S. in the Philippines,"" said Noel Medina, 25, an  organizer of a protest group called Youth for Democracy and Nationalism. ""We  are against the presence of U.S. bases in our country.""    Quayle will visit the Clark and Subic bases this afternoon after meeting  congressional leaders and placing a wreath at the U.S. World War II cemetery in  Manila.

Map, Philippines, Los Angeles Times    "," LA092789-0042   112832    September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 5; Foreign Desk      1184 words      FILIPINOS KILL 2 AMERICANS AS QUAYLE ARRIVES      By BOB DROGIN and DAVID LAUTER, Times Staff Writers      MANILA      Two American civilians working for a U.S. Air Force communications facility  north of Manila were ambushed and killed by gunmen Tuesday, hours before Vice  President Dan Quayle arrived amid anti-American demonstrations in this  increasingly tense capital city.    Although no group immediately claimed responsibility, U.S. and Philippine  officials said the ambush appeared to be the work of the Communist New People's  Army, which has killed four Americans here in the last two years.    U.S. officials confirmed that they had received threats from the NPA that  Americans would be attacked if Quayle came to Manila.      Demonstrators Chant    About 200 demonstrators chanted ""Yankee Go Home"" and burned a large American  flag as Quayle's motorcade sped away from Ninoy Aquino International Airport,  where he arrived at 7:30 p.m. The protesters demanded an end to U.S. military  bases in the Philippines.    Security officials were bracing for large demonstrations and possible violence  today as Quayle begins the formal part of his 40-hour visit to the Philippines  with a call on President Corazon Aquino at Malacanang Palace.    Quayle is expected to give Aquino a letter from President Bush formally asking  for the opening of negotiations on the future of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay  Naval Base, America's largest overseas military installations, as well as four  smaller facilities. U.S. officials said the letter proposes no specific terms.    The bases issue is increasingly divisive here. The Pentagon considers them  vital to protecting Pacific sea lanes, but many Philippine leaders regard them  as a reminder of the nation's colonial ties and an affront to national  sovereignty.    The current bases agreement expires in September, 1991. Any new agreement must  be ratified by the 23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to the bases  is strong. Other officials have called for phasing out the bases in five to 10  years.      Dead Americans Identified    The two Americans killed Tuesday were identified as William H. Thompson, 45,  and Donald G. Buchner, 44. Officials said both had retired from the Air Force  and were technicians for Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp., a Pentagon  contractor at Camp O'Donnell, about 60 miles north of Manila.    Officials said Camp O'Donnell is an Air Force communications facility with 135  employees. They help operate an electronic warfare and bombing range at Clark's  sprawling Crowe Valley training facility.    In Washington, a State Department spokesman called the killings ""senseless and  cowardly.""    Susan M. Pearce, a vice president at the headquarters of Ford Aerospace Corp.  in Newport Beach, said the company has ""maintained good relations with the  local Philippine community"" and ""there is no apparent motive for this attack.""    The two victims, both married with children, were among 85 Ford Aerospace  workers at Camp O'Donnell, Pearce said. She added that there has never been ""a  prior incident of this kind involving our personnel.""    Air Force Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark, said early today that  military personnel and Defense Department employees in the Philippines ""are  being advised to avoid non-essential travel between facilities until further  notice."" The U.S. military television network later announced that Camp  O'Donnell personnel should not report for work today.    Nearly 40,000 U.S. troops, military dependents and civilian employees are  stationed at the two bases, which employ 68,000 Filipinos.    A police spokesman said the two Americans were ambushed at 4:40 p.m. Tuesday  about 12 miles north of Clark Air Base on a rural highway that connects Camp  O'Donnell with the town of Capas in Tarlac province.    The Capas police chief, Lt. Pepito Pimentel, said Thompson was driving a Toyota  Corolla, with Buchner beside him, when a large truck suddenly blocked the road.  Pimentel said six men armed with M-16 and M-14 rifles opened fire on the  Americans, riddling them with bullets.      69 Spent Cartridges Found    ""We found 69 spent cartridges at the ambush site,"" Pimentel said.    The bodies were taken to Clark by ambulance.    ""I think there's no doubt it's the NPA,"" a military officer said early today.  He speculated that the killers were part of the Central Luzon Regional  Commission, an New People's Army guerrilla group that killed two U.S. Air Force  enlisted men and an American civilian outside Clark on Oct. 28, 1987.    Five months ago, on April 21, U.S. Army Col. James (Nick) Rowe, a  counterinsurgency expert, was ambushed and killed in the Manila suburb of  Quezon City as he was being driven to his office at the U.S. Joint Military  Assistance Group.

0,FT934-4106 ,"FT934-4106 _AN-DLFC8ABIFT 931206   FT  06 DEC 93 / Traffic law may be used to keep City cordon      By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent   City of London police may use traffic management powers to retain the controversial security cordon around the Square Mile if objectors seek its withdrawal next year. The cordon, which restricts and monitors traffic movements in the central area of the City, was set up in July after April's Bishopsgate bombing which killed one person and injured more than 40. It was introduced for a six-month experimental period under traffic powers, and the City Corporation is likely to extend the experi-ment for a further six months. Retention for longer than that would require government approval. Objectors  -possibly including surrounding boroughs - could force a public inquiry. Mr Owen Kelly, commissioner of the City of London police, said one option, rather than removing the controls pending an inquiry, would be to redesign the cordon as a new traffic management experiment. 'It would be foolhardy to remove the cordon while the terrorist threat remains,' he said. 'I would sooner answer to a charge that I had abused my power than that I had done nothing.' Mr Kelly, who retires as commissioner this week, regards his introduction of the cordon as probably the most controversial decision any chief constable has had to take in recent years. He said: 'Some people complained that it would make the City of London like Belfast, but it has not done so. The checks are not overpowering and obtrusive. Many people tell us they now feel more secure.' City of London police stepped up street patrols after last year's Baltic Exchange bombing, and a year ago last week introduced random vehicle checkpoints using armed officers. Mr Kelly said: 'The subsequent Bishopsgate bombing proved that these measures were insufficient. We had to do more. Of course terrorists can penetrate a security cordon. To make any area risk-free would involve levels of security that people would find unacceptable. But I had a duty to do all I reasonably could.' He has faced three main criticisms of the security ring - that it was a propaganda coup for the IRA, would at best divert terrorists elsewhere, and might act as a challenge to bombers to penetrate the cordon. 'I reject all three. There is no propaganda coup to equal a bomb explosion. Terrorists have to put massive planning and effort into staging a big operation and, if they want to attack the heart of the financial community, will not necessarily put the same effort into a substitute target. 'As to the argument that we are challenging them to strike again - they have proved with their attacks on the City that they do not need us to challenge them. Doing nothing was not an option.' One consequence of the security measures has been a reduction in crime in the City by 10 per cent last year, and a further 18 per cent so far this year.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Children were  terrified to learn that two people were arrested the Sunday  before last [27 February] for hiding explosives in the  kindergarten's kitchen. Parents were also terrified to learn  that their innocent children could have been killed at any  moment.    Al-BILAD has learned that last Sunday [as published], the  security agencies apprehended 'Abd-al-Majid M. and 'Imad S. [not  further identified] less than an hour after the two hid large  quantities of machine guns, weapons, and ammunition in al-Faruq  Islamic kindergarten. The kindergarten is affiliated with the  Islamic Center Society, which, as is well known, is controlled  by the Muslim Brotherhood group.    Eyewitnesses told AL-BILAD, which rushed to investigate the  story in al-Qasr, that 'Abd-al-Majid M. is considered the shaykh  of the returnees from Afghanistan. He was arrested before for  involvement in the Muhammad Army case, but was later released.    The second suspect, 'Imad S. was working as an imam at the  mosque adjacent to the kindergarten and lived in a house within  the mosque building. He was also working at an Education  Ministry school in al-Yarut town. He is married to a woman who  teaches at al-Faruq kindergarten, where the explosives were  hidden.    According to information made available to AL-BILAD,  'Abd-al-Majid M. brought the explosives in a car from Amman. He  then asked 'Imad S. to hide them in his house. However, the  latter suggested that they be placed in the mosque. The  explosives were then moved to a communal kitchen used by the  imam. The kitchen is part of the adjacent kindergarten.    Apparently, the car that brought the explosives from Amman  was under close watch by security agencies. After the  explosives were hidden, the security agencies, which were  closely monitoring the operation, hurried to arrest  'Abd-al-Majid M. and then the imam, 'Imad S., only minutes  before the call to the evening prayer in al-Yarut village, near  al-Qasr.    From its investigation into the case, AL-BILAD was shocked  to  find out that the operation was part of a new terrorist scheme  the ""Jordanian Afghans"" [term used to refer to Jordanian Muslim  militants who fought in Afghanistan] were planning to execute  outside Amman.    Informed sources told AL-BILAD that the scheme involves  moving the bombing operations from Amman to the governorates and  districts since the security agencies have gained full control  over such operations inside Amman. The scheme involves  concealing the explosives at mosques and kindergartens that are  controlled by the Islamists.    According to well-informed sources, the primary objective of  the scheme is the assassination of a General Intelligence  officer and the bombing of shops selling alcoholic drinks in the  various governorates, particularly al-Karak, as part of a  large-scale scheme aimed at disturbing Jordan's domestic  security and terrorizing and intimidating citizens.    Within this context, AL-BILAD learned that the security  agencies have uncovered large quantities of ammunition, machine  guns, and bombs in many mosques in various parts of the kingdom,  including 'Ubadah Bin-Bishr mosque in al-Subayhi, where dynamite  sticks were found.    Information leaked to AL-BILAD confirm that an Arab state is  involved in supporting the Jordanian Afghans group in these  operations. It has been proven that contacts were held between  the [Jordanian] Afghans and other Afghan parties supported by  the same state.    The final number of the ""Afghans"" arrested thus far in the  bombing cases stands at around 40. According to informed  sources, the accused will be brought to trial in the next few  days.    AL-BILAD toured al-Qasr town as soon as the weapons cache  was discovered in al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten and obtained  detailed information from the residents of the area and informed  sources on the kindergarten operation, which is considered, as  we have said, one of the major operations planned by the  Jordanian Afghans.    The first observation one can make at the kindergarten is  that the kindergarten, affiliated with the Islamic Center  Society, has more than 470 children. The weapons were hidden  less than one meter away from a kindergarten class full of  children. This means that these children could have been killed  at any time if there was any mistake in the transportation of  these explosives. Eyewitnesses also said that none of the  townspeople expected the imam of the mosque adjacent to the  kindergarten to be involved in such acts. This means that the  scheme was thoroughly planned.    AL-BILAD also learned that the mosque where the imam worked  was built at the expense of al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten, which  is affiliated with the Islamic Center Society controlled by the  Muslim Brotherhood.    Residents of the area have not observed any strong  connection  between the first and second suspects to suggest any suspicions  of an organizational link between them.    In a related development, AL-BILAD has learned that other  people suspected of affiliation with the Jordanian Afghans were  arrested in al-Rabbah area. No information or specific figures  are available yet on those arrested.    In previous issues AL-BILAD published exclusive reports on a  plan involving bombings in Amman. It also published reports on  the secret files of the Jordanian Afghans, as well as those  arrested in these cases.    It is worth noting that the Muslim Brotherhood group has not  yet reacted to reports on the hiding of weapons in a  kindergarten that they control. Residents of the area say they  think the suspects belong to the Muslim Brotherhood group.     "

The City force is also calling on businesses to make sure their own external security cameras are functioning properly. Private security video recordings have proved to be a vital source of evidence on terrorist movements. Elsewhere in London, Metropolitan Police set up armed roadblocks at the weekend in an attempt to detect terrorist movements and reassure the public. Both London police forces say they are relying on increased public vigilance in the fight against the IRA's threatened Christmas bombing campaign. The forces are working together but they have different approaches to the sensitive issue of armed officers and protection of the public. City firearms officers carry their weapons openly but their counterparts in the Met are under orders to keep them out of sight unless they are needed. In the Met area, vehicles are searched in a 'sterile zone' between the roadside and a solid line of police vehicles. Pedestrians and traffic are diverted to the far side of the barricade. In the City, pedestrians are free to walk past the search operation and there is no barricade between it and passing traffic. In activities on Friday and Saturday night, up to 45 armed police, dog handlers and traffic officers stopped and searched more than 80 vehicles, mostly vans, at roadblocks in locations around the east end of London, where police believe an IRA cell is based. No weapons, explosives or terrorist suspects were found in the operation, codenamed Rolling Rock, but similar activities are likely in future. The legal powers to conduct random checks have existed for some time, but have not been used in London before. The new tactic was a response to the IRA's recent bombing campaign using vans packed with large amounts of explosive parked outside buildings or near road junctions. Several explosions have been prevented after suspicious vans were noticed already parked by their targets or while on the move. The Lord Mayor of London, Mr Francis McWilliams, has written to the prime minister saying that the 'serious problems' between insurers and the government over cover for commercial property damaged by terrorists must be resolved urgently before uninsurability affects foreign investment and London's commercial property. The Association of British Insurers, which has recommended its members to exclude terrorist damage from new commercial policies, said that some insurers were considering cancelling existing policies on 30 days' notice, rather than waiting for them to expire.

By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A 13-year-old girl was fatally shot through her family's South Los Angeles  living room window early Saturday as she watched television, a special occasion  in which her normally strict mother had allowed her to stay up late because a  friend was spending the night.    Tanya Cadle was rendered brain dead by a single shot to her head and died hours  later at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after her parents had her disconnected  from life-support systems, a hospital spokesman said. There were no other  injuries.    ""I didn't hear the shots, I just heard my son shouting, 'Get down! Get down!' ""  said Tanya's mother, Eleanor Cadle, a devout Seventh-day Adventist. ""Then we  came out here and found (Tanya's girlfriend) on the floor and my daughter on  the sofa.""    Los Angeles police described the crime in the 3000 block of South Hillcrest  Drive as an apparent drive-by shooting. They had made no arrests Saturday.    Eleanor Cadle, a security officer at USC, said that she and her husband, Dean,  a chemical technician for a wheel manufacturer, had no idea what led to the  shooting but that they resented early news reports implying that the crime was  gang related. ""No one here is affiliated with the gangs and we have nothing to  retaliate about,"" she said firmly, as friends and fellow church members crowded  her small home.    The family, originally from Belize, moved to the quiet street of  well-maintained bungalows about two months ago in the belief that it was a step  up from their home on South Catalina Street.    ""I was looking for something better and it's better than where I was,"" Eleanor  Cadle said.    The incident was one of a number of shootings that took place over the weekend,  including a 13-year-old who was shot to death in Pomona while he slept.    At the Cadle home in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles, grim family friends  shook their heads in disbelief and anger as they took in the enormity of the  violence. Bloodstains were visible on the brown sofa where Tanya had been  watching television, across from a brightly lit Christmas tree. Lace and  peach-colored curtains adorned the bullet-shatterred window and a well-thumbed  Bible was on the coffee table.    Tanya was a B student at Forshay Junior High School and had just returned from  a church youth meeting when she asked to stay up late watching a video, her  mother said.    ""They are a very nice family and they try to bring their kids up as best they  can,"" said Clarine Davis, a friend. ""It's a respectable family -- that's why it  hurt so much when they said it was related to gangs.    ""We don't understand. We're just baffled.

But North Korea, branded as the major security risk in the  region because of its alleged nuclear weapons program, did not  send a delegation to the annual gathering for the second year in  a row.    China, Pyongyang's close ally, canceled its participation at  short notice, citing the date of the conference as inconvenient.    While the organizer, the U.N. Center on Disarmament Affairs,  was eager to stress that China's absence ""has no political  meaning,"" the prevailing opinion at the conference is that the  cancellation is due to the controversy over the nuclear issue.    Welcoming the 62 participants, Yoneo Hirata, parliamentary  vice foreign minister, pledged that Japan will not aim at  becoming a military power.    ""We reconfirm our basic policy not to turn into a military  power, but to develop an active policy of contributing to  disarmament,"" Hirata said.    He called on North Korea to dispel suspicion that it plans  to  build nuclear weapons by fully accepting international  inspections of its nuclear facilities.    Speaking at the first plenary session on ""disarmament  through  regional dialogue,"" Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  President Yohei Kono proposed that all nuclear powers discuss  nuclear disarmament at a special conference in Hiroshima next  year.    Kono urged the atomic powers to show their devotion to  nuclear disarmament by concluding a comprehensive ban on nuclear  tests by August next year, which marks the 50th anniversary of  both the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only  cities in the world to have sustained a nuclear attack, and the  establishment of the United Nations.    Discussions at the conference are expected to focus on the  promotion of security in the Asia-Pacific region and on the  extension of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which  comes up for renewal in 1995.    In the past, the 1968 international treaty, which aims at  curbing the spread of nuclear weapons and fissionable material  to nonnuclear countries, has been extended for five-year periods.    The nuclear powers, first of all the United States, have  proposed to extend the NPT indefinitely, an approach opposed by  many nonnuclear states on the grounds that such a move would  perpetuate the nuclear ""club"" of Britain, China, France, Russia  and the U.S.    After the end of the official part of the conference Friday,  the participants, including New Zealand's minister for  disarmament and arms control, Douglas Graham, and Russia's Ednan  Agayev, director of analysis forecasting at the Foreign  Ministry, are scheduled to meet with A-bomb survivors at a  public symposium.    Earlier in the day, the disarmament experts visited the  Peace  Memorial Museum and prayed at the memorial cenotaph for victims  of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park.    Similar meetings have been held every year in Japan since  Kyoto hosted the first session in 1989. This year's conference  is the sixth of its kind.     "

Children were  terrified to learn that two people were arrested the Sunday  before last [27 February] for hiding explosives in the  kindergarten's kitchen. Parents were also terrified to learn  that their innocent children could have been killed at any  moment.    Al-BILAD has learned that last Sunday [5 March; as  published], the security agencies apprehended 'Abd-al-Majid M.  and 'Imad S. [not further identified] less than an hour after  the two hid large quantities of machine guns, weapons, and  ammunition in al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten. The kindergarten  is affiliated with the Islamic Center Society, which, as is well  known, is controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood group.    Eyewitnesses told AL-BILAD, which rushed to investigate the  story in al-Qasr, that 'Abd-al-Majid M. is considered the shaykh  of the returnees from Afghanistan. He was arrested before for  involvement in the Muhammad Army case, but was later released.    The second suspect, 'Imad S. was working as an imam at the  mosque adjacent to the kindergarten and lived in a house within  the mosque building. He was also working at an Education  Ministry school in al-Yarut town. He is married to a woman who  teaches at al-Faruq kindergarten, where the explosives were  hidden.    According to information made available to AL-BILAD,  'Abd-al-  Majid M. brought the explosives in a car from Amman. He then  asked 'Imad S. to hide them in his house. However, the latter  suggested that they be placed in the mosque. The explosives  were then moved to a communal kitchen used by the imam. The  kitchen is part of the adjacent kindergarten.    Apparently, the car that brought the explosives from Amman  was under close watch by security agencies. After the  explosives were hidden, the security agencies, which were  closely monitoring the operation, hurried to arrest  'Abd-al-Majid M. and then the imam, 'Imad S., only minutes  before the call to the evening prayer in al- Yarut village, near  al-Qasr.    From its investigation into the case, AL-BILAD was shocked  to  find out that the operation was part of a new terrorist scheme  the ""Jordanian Afghans"" [term used to refer to Jordanian Muslim  militants who fought in Afghanistan] were planning to execute  outside Amman.    Informed sources told AL-BILAD that the scheme involves  moving the bombing operations from Amman to the governorates and  districts since the security agencies have gained full control  over such operations inside Amman. The scheme involves  concealing the explosives at mosques and kindergartens that are  controlled by the Islamists.    According to well-informed sources, the primary objective of  the scheme is the assassination of a General Intelligence  officer and the bombing of shops selling alcoholic drinks in the  various governorates, particularly al-Karak, as part of a  large-scale scheme aimed at disturbing Jordan's domestic  security and terrorizing and intimidating citizens.    Within this context, AL-BILAD learned that the security  agencies have uncovered large quantities of ammunition, machine  guns, and bombs in many mosques in various parts of the kingdom,  including 'Ubadah Bin-Bishr mosque in al-Subayhi, where dynamite  sticks were found.    Information leaked to AL-BILAD confirm that an Arab state is  involved in supporting the Jordanian Afghans group in these  operations. It has been proven that contacts were held between  the [Jordanian] Afghans and other Afghan parties supported by  the same state.    The final number of the ""Afghans"" arrested thus far in the  bombing cases stands at around 40. According to informed  sources, the accused will be brought to trial in the next few  days.    AL-BILAD toured al-Qasr town as soon as the weapons cache  was  discovered in al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten and obtained  detailed information from the residents of the area and informed  sources on the kindergarten operation, which is considered, as  we have said, one of the major operations planned by the  Jordanian Afghans.    The first observation one can make at the kindergarten is  that the kindergarten, affiliated with the Islamic Center  Society, has more than 470 children. The weapons were hidden  less than one meter away from a kindergarten class full of  children. This means that these children could have been killed  at any time if there was any mistake in the transportation of  these explosives. Eyewitnesses also said that none of the  townspeople expected the imam of the mosque adjacent to the  kindergarten to be involved in such acts. This means that the  scheme was thoroughly planned.    AL-BILAD also learned that the mosque where the imam worked  was built at the expense of al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten, which  is affiliated with the Islamic Center Society controlled by the  Muslim Brotherhood.    Residents of the area have not observed any strong  connection  between the first and second suspects to suggest any suspicions  of an organizational link between them.    In a related development, AL-BILAD has learned that other  people suspected of affiliation with the Jordanian Afghans were  arrested in al-Rabbah area. No information or specific figures  are available yet on those arrested.    In previous issues AL-BILAD published exclusive reports on a  plan involving bombings in Amman. It also published reports on  the secret files of the Jordanian Afghans, as well as those  arrested in these cases.    It is worth noting that the Muslim Brotherhood group has not  yet reacted to reports on the hiding of weapons in a  kindergarten that they control. Residents of the area say they  think the suspects belong to the Muslim Brotherhood group.     "

0,FT921-714 ,"FT921-714 _AN-CC0BDAEPFT 920327   FT  27 MAR 92 / Libya tells court it is being blackmailed: Tripoli asks International Court to restrain US, Britain and France from using force      By RONALD VAN DE KROL      THE HAGUE   LIBYA WENT to the International Court of Justice yesterday seeking an emergency injunction to restrain the US and Britain from using force or imposing sanctions in their campaign to get Tripoli to surrender two Libyans alleged to have been involved in the Lockerbie bombing. In its application, Libya requested that the US and Britain be told to stop 'taking any action against Libya calculated to coerce or compel Libya to surrender the accused individuals to any jurisdiction outside of Libya.' Libya saw 'no reason why it should give into this illegal and arbitrary blackmail,' Mr Mohammed Al-Fatouri, Libya's ambassador to Brussels, said. Addressing the court's 16 judges in the main chamber of the Peace Palace, the court's seat in The Hague, Mr Al-Fatouri drew attention to what he said were the 'progressively more explicit threats' from the US and Britain.' He recalled in court that Libya had been the target of US air raids in 1986, when the US had linked Libya to the bombing of a Berlin disco frequented by US servicemen. Professor Ian Brownlie, an Oxford law don speaking on behalf of Libya, described the refusal by high-ranking officials such as US President George Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle to rule out the use of force, coupled with their demands for extradition of the two Libyans, as a 'pattern of ultimatums not seen for some decades'. Britain said the case was an attempt by Libya to ward off UN Security Council-mandated sanctions. Mr Frank Berman, a Foreign Office legal adviser, told the court that the case was 'directed at interfering with the function and prerogatives of the Security Council under the United Nations charter'. Professor Rosalind Higgins, counsel for the UK, said Libya's request for provisional measures were too 'vague, imprecise and unsuitable' to be ordered by the World Court. Mr Alan Rodger, solicitor general for Scotland, said Libya's legal reasoning was fundamentally flawed. 'Libya will say anything, however inconsistent, to postpone the day that it may have to accept responsibility for its actions.' The hearings are expected to continue today but it is likely to take at least several weeks before the court rules on Libya's request for 'provisional measures'. The US, Britain and France have already said that they will not wait for the verdict before putting a sanctions resolution before the Security Council. Mr Edwin Williamson, a legal adviser to the US State Department who will address the court later in the proceedings, said yesterday, 'This (court) action in no way inhibits what the Security Council is doing.' Britain and the US wish to put the two men on trial for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 above the Scottish town of Lockerbie in which 270 people died.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Police said the explosives, found during a routine check, were believed to have been destined for a mainland bombing campaign. The discovery raised fears of a new wave of violence by the Irish Republican Army as it considers last December's Downing Street Declaration.

0,FT932-12548 ,"FT932-12548 _AN-DD1B4ACDFT 930428   FT  28 APR 93 / Police reject criticism of blast prevention policy      By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS   CITY of London Police mounted a robust defence yesterday of criticisms that it might have done more to prevent Saturday's bomb. Commander Hugh Moore, responsible for operational policing of the City, said: 'There is nowhere in the world that has more police officers in a square mile.' He said the force had been the first in the country to instigate armed road checks, which were were introduced after the Baltic Exchange bomb last year. The last check before the latest bombing had been carried out on Friday night. The force has been under increasing pressure from other police forces, politicians and anti-terrorist experts worried about whether the City's policing is adequate to counter the terrorist threat of the IRA. Cmdr Moore said: 'We have surveillance cameras everywhere. This lorry (containing the bomb) was seen on surveillance cameras but it doesn't help you. Of course it helps you afterwards but it's no use at the time. Your camera doesn't arrest people. 'The only way to prevent bombings is to stop the vehicle en route because once it gets into position with the bomb set you can't do much about it unless a bomb expert can get into it and defuse it.' He was speaking after Mr John Burrow, the president of the Association of Chief Constables, asked for authority to mount roadblocks if forces considered there was a security risk. At present police are allowed to carry out spot checks only if they have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. Any extension would need to be approved by parliament. Details emerged yesterday of the extent to which the IRA had wrong-footed MI5 and police throughout the country. The IRA operation leading to the bomb was was well under way on March 20 when the tipper truck used in the attack was stolen. Ten hours before the bomb went off a message, based on MI5 intelligence and circulated by Special Branch to all 43 police forces around the country, could not be more specific than to request greater vigilance because of the 'heightened threat of terrorist attack'. Neither MI5 nor Special Branch was able to pinpoint a time, target, or city. It is thought that if the message had been able to do so the IRA would almost certainly have aborted its bombing operation. One police source said yesterday: 'We have had that sort of message many times before this year and it has not always led to a bomb going off.' Mr Barry Sheerman, Labour's frontbench spokesman on the disabled, who spent four years as the party's spokesman on home affairs, said that the bomb was further evidence that a national police force was needed on the lines of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to tackle the IRA. Professor Paul Wilkinson, an anti-terrorist expert based at St Andrews University, said the weekend bomb had demonstrated a lack of co-ordinated police response. It had, he said, also showed that the City of London police did not have the resources to deal with the terrorist threat.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Critics say the celebration on October 3 in the former rocket base of Peenemunde is in poor taste, because the supersonic V2 killed thousands of British civilians, while 20,000 concentration camp inmates died making it. The organisers say the V2 - whose inventor, Werner von Braun, later headed the US space programme - was 'the first step into space'. Germans protested in May when Britain erected a statue to Gen 'Bomber' Harris, who initiated the carpet bombing which destroyed Dresden and many other cities.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Judge Hunayn and Judge Jozeph Furayhah, who is investigating  the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, this morning  received in their offices at the Justice Palace lawyers for a  number of detainees and petitions from their families. The  judges agreed to some of the requests.    According to the judicial sources, Chief Public Prosecutor  Judge Munif 'Uwaydat asked that the treatment of Dr. Ja'ja' be  improved. 'Uwaydat pointed out, however, that Dr. Ja'ja is not  being treated badly and that Justice Minister Bahij Tabbarah is  taking care of this.

Some of them are  being examined by investigating judges and are automatically  activated when new evidence appears. Other cases, including the  assassination of Deputy Tony Franjiyah and his family, require  the appointment of new investigating judges.

They said that  Judge Labib Zuwayn left the case about a year ago and that the  security agencies are now appointing a judge to investigate this  file. The sources said there is no request to extradite Michel  'Awn because such a request cannot be made before an arrest  warrant is issued by the investigating judge. The case is  awaiting the appointment of an investigating judge and an  extradition request is not appropriate at present.

At least five of the  fatalities were in Los Angeles County, the coroner reported.    In addition, nearly 1,000 motorists had been arrested in the county as of  Monday morning for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the  holiday weekend. About 400 of the arrests were made Saturday night in a  coordinated effort by 33 law enforcement agencies at 16 sobriety checkpoints,  according to Gardena police, who tallied results of the effort.

The baby was  injured early Sunday morning in a quarrel between her mother, Rosa Molina, and  Jacinto Peres, 31, of Lennox, authorities said.    ""Peres is being charged with murder and will remain in custody without bail,""  Sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner said. The infant's mother, who also was injured,  was treated at County-Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and released.    An 8-year-old Lancaster girl, Saquita Marie Simons, apparently drowned about  noon Monday when the 19-foot ski boat in which she was riding sank after it was  was swamped by high winds and waves in Lake Isabella in Kern County.    Two 19-year-olds from Lancaster, who also were in the boat, were pulled to  safety by another boater. But the child, who was not wearing a preserver, sank  with the boat, the Kern County Sheriff's Department said. A two-hour search  failed to find the body.    There were no casualties, however, when a 50-foot yacht sank in heavy seas  Monday while returning to Santa Barbara from a holiday trip. Two couples aboard  the mahogany-hulled Royal Caprice, heading back from Santa Cruz Island about  3:40 p.m., were rescued when a fleet of boats responded to its distress call,  authorities said.    Before the rescue boats arrived, the four passengers ""got into a skiff, but it  quickly capsized,"" tumbling them into 62-degree water, said Steve Lewis, harbor  master with the Santa Barbara Harbor Patrol. One of the women was treated for  hypothermia.      Drowning Victim    On Sunday, a Huntington Park man drowned while swimming in Lake Mead, Nev., the  National Park Service reported, as winds gusted up to 60 m.p.h. and caused  choppy water. The victim, who was not identified pending notification of  relatives, ""had been drinking"" and then decided to swim, Park Service spokesman  Don Hamilton said.    ""He went into an area six to eight feet deep,"" Hamilton added. ""His friends  stated he was yelling in Spanish and waving his hands, but didn't appear in any  difficulty. For some reason he went underwater and did not come back up.""    Over the long weekend, authorities reported that at least 13 people were killed  in the Los Angeles area in shootings and other violence.    In an apparently gang-related incident in South-Central Los Angeles, five  people at a back-yard barbecue near 78th Street and Stanford Avenue were shot  by an unknown number of assailants about 1 a.m. Monday, Los Angeles Police Lt.  Frank Valdez said.    The victims, three males and two females aged 15 to 24, never saw their  attackers, he said, because ""their backs were to the street."" One victim was  hospitalized and listed in serious condition, Valdez added, while the others  were treated and released. The attackers fled on foot, police said.    In a second gang-related incident Monday, a 17-year-old youth was shot in the  abdomen in a drive-by shooting at 62nd Street and Vermont Avenue, Valdez said.

Statewide Totals    An additional 577 people were arrested in the Los Angeles area by the CHP,  which made a total of 2,105 such arrests statewide.    The CHP statistics, which covered the period from 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m.  Monday, were running higher than a year ago, Officer Andy Gutierrez said, with  10 more traffic deaths and 334 more arrests than over the same period of 1988.    The holiday weekend also was marked by tragedy and violence. An 11-month-old  Lennox girl, Roxanne Diaz-Molina, died Monday of head injuries inflicted by her  mother's boyfriend, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. The baby was  injured early Sunday morning in a quarrel between her mother, Rosa Molina, and  Jacinto Peres, 31, of Lennox, authorities said.    ""Peres is being charged with murder and will remain in custody without bail,""  Sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner said. The infant's mother, who also was injured,  was treated at County-Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and released.    An 8-year-old Lancaster girl, Saquita Marie Simons, apparently drowned about  noon Monday when the 19-foot ski boat in which she was riding sank after it was  was swamped by high winds and waves in Lake Isabella in Kern County.    Two 19-year-olds from Lancaster, who also were in the boat, were pulled to  safety by another boater. But the child, who was not wearing a preserver, sank  with the boat, the Kern County Sheriff's Department said. A two-hour search  failed to find the body.    There were no casualties, however, when a 50-foot yacht sank in heavy seas  Monday while returning to Santa Barbara from a holiday trip. Two couples aboard  the mahogany-hulled Royal Caprice, heading back from Santa Cruz Island about  3:40 p.m., were rescued when a fleet of boats responded to its distress call,  authorities said.    Before the rescue boats arrived, the four passengers ""got into a skiff, but it  quickly capsized,"" tumbling them into 62-degree water, said Steve Lewis, harbor  master with the Santa Barbara Harbor Patrol. One of the women was treated for  hypothermia.      Drowning Victim    On Sunday, a Huntington Park man drowned while swimming in Lake Mead, Nev., the  National Park Service reported, as winds gusted up to 60 m.p.h. and caused  choppy water. The victim, who was not identified pending notification of  relatives, ""had been drinking"" and then decided to swim, Park Service spokesman  Don Hamilton said.    ""He went into an area six to eight feet deep,"" Hamilton added. ""His friends  stated he was yelling in Spanish and waving his hands, but didn't appear in any  difficulty. For some reason he went underwater and did not come back up.""    Over the long weekend, authorities reported that at least 13 people were killed  in the Los Angeles area in shootings and other violence.    In an apparently gang-related incident in South-Central Los Angeles, five  people at a back-yard barbecue near 78th Street and Stanford Avenue were shot  by an unknown number of assailants about 1 a.m. Monday, Los Angeles Police Lt.  Frank Valdez said.    The victims, three males and two females aged 15 to 24, never saw their  attackers, he said, because ""their backs were to the street."" One victim was  hospitalized and listed in serious condition, Valdez added, while the others  were treated and released. The attackers fled on foot, police said.    In a second gang-related incident Monday, a 17-year-old youth was shot in the  abdomen in a drive-by shooting at 62nd Street and Vermont Avenue, Valdez said.  He was listed in critical condition at Martin Luther King General Hospital.

Vice President Koreaki Hagihara, 66, and Director Juichi  Konishi, 59, allegedly conspired to give the money to Ishii, 69,  as a reward for favorable treatment in the awarding of public  works projects, informed sources said.    Investigators from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors  Office also raided the Osaka and Tokyo headquarters of Obayashi  and other related sites in a search for evidence of suspected  illicit payments.    Obayashi President Takao Tsumuro apologized for the  controversy but denied the company's involvement in the scandal.    Obayashi is Japan's fourth largest construction firm in  terms  of sales, following Shimizu Corp., Kajima Corp. and Taisei Corp.    The sources said the Osaka-based company is suspected of  giving Ishii 10 million yen in October 1992 after asking him for  favorable consideration in its bid for an 8.2 billion yen  project to construct a waste incineration plant in Sendai, the  capital of Miyagi Prefecture.    The alleged bribe was also intended as a reward for his  efforts in awarding such projects as building a subway station,  the sources said.    The money is believed to have been received on Ishii's  behalf  by his aide Mitsuo Moriya, deputy secretary general of the  Miyagi Prefectural chapter of the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), who is under indictment in a separate bribery case  involving former Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro Honma.    Investigators suspect that Ishii, as mayor of Sendai, may  have received a total of 140 million yen in payments from eight  construction companies, including Obayashi, for alleged  favorable consideration on project bids, the sources said.  Ishii resigned as mayor soon after he was arrested last June.    In a related development, informed sources said Obayashi's  wholly owned subsidiary allegedly paid some 30 million yen in  rental payments for a Tokyo office of senior LDP politician  Hiroshi Mitsuzuka.    The subsidiary shouldered about 500,000 yen a month for five  years starting from December 1983, the sources said.    Mitsuzuka, former chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs  Research Council, has been elected as a House of Representatives  member from a constituency in Miyagi Prefecture.    Commenting on the arrest of Obayashi's executives,  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said he thinks the series of  arrests of top executives of general contractors represents ""a  structural problem"" in the country's construction industry.    Igarashi stressed the need for fundamental reform of the  industry.    After the arrests of the senior Obayashi officials, several  municipal and prefectural governments announced they will  suspend nominating the company as a bidder in public works  projects.    Kanagawa Prefecture and the city of Yokohama, south of  Tokyo,  decided to suspend nomination of Obayashi as a bidder for three  months until April 17.    Okayama Prefecture and Kitakyushu City, western Japan,  imposed a four months' ban on the company's participation in  public works bids.     "

The banks used in the recycling scheme included Monte dei  Paschi di Siena, Banca Commerciale Italiana and the Banca  Populare dell'Etruria e del Lazio.    Vigna said his office was notifying Bank of Italy about the  financial institutes failure to report bank operations over 20  million lire. ""Under present rules, only administrative  sanctions can be applied against banks that don't comply, but  that needs to be changed,"" Vigna said.    ""A traffic on a scale and of a nature such as to risk  throwing out of kilter the mechanisms of the gold market in  Italy and, indeed, throughout the world,"" was how expert Adriano  Pansa described the laundry set up by the Cali cartel and the  Arezzo gold traders.    Revealing that investigators had uncovered details on just  three single operations totalling 300 million dollars, Pansa  pointed out that the money-washers were not overconcerned about  making a profit, since their main objective was simply to change  the drug revenue into cash, and thus often sold their gold below  the going rate.    He expressed the view that the apparent lack of Sicilian  Mafia involvement did not mean Cosa Nostra had not also been  using the laundry, since the mob has made a point of delegating  recycling to so-called ""white-collar"" teams, especially since  the massive Green Ice narco-traffic bust 18 months ago.    Six of the eight arrests in Italy, including Delgado (37),  were made at or near the northeastern city of Vicenza, home of  an alleged Italian ringleader, jewelry trader Rino Perozzo, and  also home to the twice-yearly Vicenza Gold trade fair (reputedly  the world's most important jewelry event), which has just opened.    The others arrested at Vicenza or nearby Bassano del Grappa  were Carlo Fabbroni (35), Fabrizio Meotti (47), Luciano Pataro  (43), and Nicola Pirro (25). Pataro's brother was arrested in  Arezzo. Of the four arrests in Panama, two were a well-known  pair of brothers--only the surname, Schwartz, was released  here--who have reportedly held a monopoly in gold trading since  the time of felled dictator Roberto Noriega.    The operation began last June when the US Drug Enforcement  Administration notified Italian authorities of a payment of  150,000 dollars from a US bank. Investigators traced the money  back to three Arezzo companies: Aurea Trading International,  Italian representative for the US Universe Gold Enterprise (both  owned by the Pataro brothers); Simar Joyeros Mayoristas, with an  office in Arezzo headed by Meotti and another in Panama run by  the Schwartz brothers; and Eurocatene, headed by Fabbroni.    These three companies held the bank accounts into which the  narcodollars were sent to be used to buy up gold on the Italian  market. The gold was then sent to be sold in Panama, after  which the clean dollars returned to the drug-traffickers.     "

Speaking at a press conference, he said Iraqi intelligence  agents were directly involved in the bombing and two Iraqi  officers, Abdul-Amir 'Ali and Raad Mostafa Fattah have been  arrested who have admitted their terrorist actions.    He said the Iraqi regime has directly assigned its  intelligence officers to plant bombs in Iranian large cities  since last February after being disappointed with its internal  agents in Iran.    Hojjat-ol-Eslam Fallahiyan said that Iraqi intelligence  officers had carried 22 bombs, mostly magnetic into Iran, adding  that 14 bombs had been seized by police. He said the terrorists  exploded 4 bombs in the streets and investigations are underway  to detect the others. Evidences indicate that the terrorists  may have destroyed the other four bombs, he said.    Six internal elements nammed Shakour Rostami, Havas Azizi,  Ali Behruzi, Ahmad Asghari, Davoud Jaafar and Nejad Faissal who  were in contact with the Iraqi intelligence officers are now  under arrest and have confessed to their charges.    The information minister showed a video-tape to reporters  showing the confessions of the Iraqi intelligence officers and  their internal elements in Iran.    On Iraq's objectives behind the terrorist actions,  Fallahiyan  said the Iraqi regime and the counterrevolutionary grouplets  were trying to carry out explosions in Iran and attribute them  to internal issues and pretend that the people were against the  ruling system.    Asked about the Iranians living abroad, he said, ""We welcome  the return of our fellow-countrymen, but there is no compulsion  in this regard.""    The majority of those who live abroad have no special  problem  and travel freely, but, he said, those who have legal problems  should refer to the judiciary.    About Saeedi Sirjani (a writer), he said he had been  arrested  for addiction and drug smuggling, but further inve stigations  showed that he had cooperation with Savak (former regime's  secret police).    He has been a drug addict for a long time, so it is natural  that the addiction would lead him to some ethical weaknesses.    Saeedi Sirjani has had links with the western intelligence  services as well and the matter will be disclosed after  completion of the investigations, he said.    About the bugging of the Iranian embassy in London by the  intelligence service of the United Kingdom, he said the  information ministry had already received reports on the issue  which was announced after official confirmation.    He said all the dimensions of the bugging of the Iranian  embassy in London had not been disclosed yet due to security  reasons.    He regretted that the UK government regarded the blatant  violation of the international law in the embassy case as a  matter of normalcy.    Asked about Iran-Turkey security relations, and the  propaganda campaign of Turkish media on the alleged Iranian  interference in internal affairs of that country, he said  contacts between the officials of the two countries showed that  Iran has not intervened in their domestice affairs and will not  do so.

The RAM leader, who requested anonymity, yesterday said the  cache of explosives, mostly bombs used by the Armed Forces of  the Philippines, was given to leaders of the ABB sometime in  1990 after the RAM and the then Manila-Rizal committee of the  Communist Party of the Philippines agreed to enter an ""informal  united front"" to topple the administration of President Corazon  Aquino.    The Manila-Rizal faction of the CPP [Communist Party of the  Philippines] led by Felimon Lagman, broke off from self-exiled  party founder Jose Maria last year, but kept the bombs given by  the RAM.    ""It's possible that the explosives used by the ABB team in  bombing the head offices of three oil companies were part of the  cache of explosives that were given to them,"" the military rebel  said.    The ABB had claimed responsibility for the bombing of the  offices of Shell and Petron in Makati and Caltex in Manila in  protest over the 28 January decision of the Energy Regulatory  Board to increase oil prices.    Two security guards of Petron were wounded during the  bombings on 1 February. The ABB the next day said it would stop  the bomb attacks to give way to street protests against the oil  price increase.    President Ramos, on the eve of a planned general strike 9  February agreed to roll back fuel prices, triggered off by a P1  [Philippine pesos]-per-liter oil levy but on condition  alternative sources of revenue were found.    The RAM leader's disclosure that bombs were given by the  military rebels to the ABB supports the claim by communist  factions loyal to Sison that the ABB is capable of ""terroristic  attacks"" in Metro Manila.    Nova Salvacion, spokesman of a group in the Manila-Rizal  communist committee which remained loyal to Sison, has said that  a number of the bombs given by the RAM were planted by the ABB  in ""strategic areas"" between 1990 and 1991 to promote chaos and  provoke street fighting in Metro Manila.    According to Salvacion, some of the planted bombs are still  intact and could still be detonated.    The planned bombings at that time were aimed at creating an  insurrectionary situation"" that will lead to the collapse of the  Aquino administration.    At the height of protests calling for a permanent roll back  in fuel prices last 9 February, police discovered several home  made bombs and C-4 blasting caps inside the Motorola compound  along the South Superhighway in Sucat, Paranaque.    Police investigators, however, failed to determine whether  the bombs were part of a terror plot timed with the 9 February  nationwide protest.    They also failed to identify the group responsible for  planting the bombs inside the Motorola compound, owned by the  family of businessmen Raul and Jose Concepcion, who supported  the call for a general strike. Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan  III claimed ""extremist groups"" planted the bombs found in  Paranaque. Alunan, however, did not identify the group.     "

Although no group immediately claimed responsibility, U.S. and Philippine  officials said the bloody ambush appeared to be the work of the Communist New  People's Army, which has assassinated four other Americans in the last two  years.    U.S. officials confirmed that they had received threats from the NPA that  Americans would be attacked if Quayle arrived here.      'People Are Sickened'    ""It should go without saying that these cowardly murders deserve the strong  condemnation of all civilized men and women,"" Quayle told a breakfast meeting  with business groups. ""The people of the Philippines, like the people of the  United States, are sickened by the acts of vicious terrorists who wish to drown  freedom in the blood of innocent men and women.    ""The killings unfortunately were timed to my visit,"" he told reporters.    The two slain Americans were identified as William H. Thompson, 45, and Donald  G. Buchner, 44. Officials said both men had retired from the Air Force in 1987  and were technicians for Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp., a Pentagon  contractor at Camp O'Donnell, about 60 miles north of Manila.    Susan M. Pearce, a vice president at the headquarters of Ford Aerospace Corp.  in Newport Beach, Calif., said the company has ""maintained good relations with  the local Philippine community"" and ""there is no apparent motive for this  attack.""    The two victims, both married with children, were among 85 Ford Aerospace  workers at Camp O'Donnell, Pearce said. She added that there has never been ""a  prior incident of this kind involving our personnel.""      Communications Facility    Officials said Camp O'Donnell is a sophisticated military communications  facility with a U.S. Navy radio transmitter, an embassy radio relay station,  and an Air Force electronic warfare system for Clark's sprawling Crowe Valley  bombing range. O'Donnell has about 135 military and civilian employees.    Quayle also met briefly with the widow of an officer of President Corazon  Aquino's palace guard, who was killed in a separate ambush earlier Tuesday  about a mile from the presidential palace. Quayle blamed the New People's Army  for his death as well.    About 200 demonstrators chanted ""Yankee Go Home"" and burned a large American  flag as Quayle's motorcade sped past the entrance to Ninoy Aquino International  Airport when Quayle arrived Tuesday evening. The protesters demanded an end to  U.S. military bases in the Philippines.    Security officials blocked streets and kept demonstrators far from the vice  president this morning as Quayle began the formal portion of his 40-hour visit  to the Philippines with a wreath-laying ceremony and a 40-minute meeting with  President Corazon Aquino at Malacanang Palace.    Quayle presented Aquino with a letter from President Bush formally asking to  open negotiations over the future of Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base,  America's largest overseas military garrisons, and four smaller facilities. The  one-page letter asked that talks begin by December but offered no specific  terms, U.S. officials said.    The bases issue is increasingly divisive here. The Pentagon considers the  installations vital to protecting Pacific sea lanes and preserving stability in  the region. But many Philippine leaders regard them as a vestige of the  nation's colonial ties to the U.S. and an affront to national sovereignty.    The current contract for the bases expires in September, 1991. Any new  agreement must be ratified by the 23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition  to the bases is strong. Other officials have called for phasing the bases out  in five to ten years.    In Washington, meanwhile, a State Department spokesman denounced the killings  of the two Americans as ""senseless and cowardly.""    Air Force Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark Air Base, said early today  that military personnel and Department of Defense employees in the Philippines  ""are being advised to avoid non-essential travel between facilities until  further notice."" The U.S. military television network later announced that Camp  O'Donnell personnel should not report for work today.    Nearly 40,000 U.S. troops, military dependents and civilian employees are  stationed at the bases. They also employ 68,000 Filipinos.    Police said the two Americans were ambushed Tuesday afternoon about 12 miles  north of Clark on a paved rural highway that connects Camp O'Donnell with the  town of Capas in Tarlac province.    Capas Police Chief Pepito Pimentel said Thompson was driving a Toyota Corolla  south, with Buckner beside him, when a dump truck suddenly blocked the road.  Pimentel said six men armed with M-16 and M-14 assault rifles leaped out and  opened fire on the Americans, riddling them and the car with bullets. The two  men were found slumped in their seats, with both doors open. ""The bodies were  heavily mangled,"" Pimentel said. ""We found 69 spent cartridges at the ambush  site.""    Capas Mayor Hermes Frias said nothing was taken from the bodies, and the car  was not ransacked. ""This was a well planned ambush,"" he said. ""They knew what  time the car was passing by.""    The assailants fled in a jeepney. An M-16 magazine and live 9-millimeter  bullets were found in the dump truck.    ""I think there's no doubt it's the NPA,"" one Western military official said  early today. He speculated that the killers were part of the Central Luzon  Regional Front, an New People's Army guerrilla group that killed two U.S. Air  Force enlisted men and an American civilian outside Clark on Oct. 28, 1987.    Five months ago, on April 21, U.S. Army Col. James Rowe, a counterinsurgency  expert, was ambushed and killed in the Manila suburb of Quezon City as he was  being driven to his office at the U.S. Joint Military Assistance Group.    The New People's Army later said it killed Rowe, 51, a heavily decorated  Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, for his ""direct"" involvement in the  Philippine government's ""total war"" policy against the rebels.    Two weeks earlier, guerrillas blew up a communications facility operated by the  U.S. Air Force and Navy and the Philippine military near Baguio in northern  Luzon. No one was injured.    Tuesday's ambush came after a week of arrests and demonstrations outside the  U.S. Embassy, a series of shootings and grenade attacks in Manila, and a  barrage of anti-American press reports over alleged ""meddling"" in Philippine  affairs.    Early Tuesday, unidentified gunmen shot and killed Capt. Carlos Daileg, a staff  officer of President Aquino's security command as he drove his car about a mile  from the presidential palace. He was the fourth member of the presidential  guard killed in the past four months.    Later Tuesday, 10 students were arrested after demonstrators protesting  Quayle's visit and rising tuition fees tossed a small homemade bomb at riot  police on a street across the Pasig River from the presidential palace. Six  police were injured.

Although no group immediately claimed responsibility, U.S. and Philippine  officials said the bloody ambush appeared to be the work of the Communist New  People's Army, which has assassinated four other Americans in the last two  years.    U.S. officials confirmed that they had received threats from the NPA that  Americans would be attacked if Quayle arrived here.      'People Are Sickened'    ""It should go without saying that these cowardly murders deserve the strong  condemnation of all civilized men and women,"" Quayle told a breakfast meeting  with business groups. ""The people of the Philippines, like the people of the  United States, are sickened by the acts of vicious terrorists who wish to drown  freedom in the blood of innocent men and women.    ""The killings unfortunately were timed to my visit,"" he told reporters.    The two slain Americans were identified as William H. Thompson, 45, and Donald  G. Buchner, 44. Officials said both men had retired from the Air Force in 1987  and were technicians for Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp., a Pentagon  contractor at Camp O'Donnell, about 60 miles north of Manila.    Susan M. Pearce, a vice president at the headquarters of Ford Aerospace Corp.  in Newport Beach, Calif., said the company has ""maintained good relations with  the local Philippine community"" and ""there is no apparent motive for this  attack.""    The two victims, both married with children, were among 85 Ford Aerospace  workers at Camp O'Donnell, Pearce said. She added that there has never been ""a  prior incident of this kind involving our personnel.""      Communications Facility    Officials said Camp O'Donnell is a sophisticated military communications  facility with a U.S. Navy radio transmitter, an embassy radio relay station,  and an Air Force electronic warfare system for Clark's sprawling Crowe Valley  bombing range. O'Donnell has about 135 military and civilian employees.    Quayle also met briefly with the widow of an officer of President Corazon  Aquino's palace guard, who was killed in a separate ambush earlier Tuesday  about a mile from the presidential palace. Quayle blamed the New People's Army  for his death as well.    About 200 demonstrators chanted ""Yankee Go Home"" and burned a large American  flag as Quayle's motorcade sped past the entrance to Ninoy Aquino International  Airport when Quayle arrived Tuesday evening. The protesters demanded an end to  U.S. military bases in the Philippines.

Paul Hughes, 30, Donna Maguire, 27, and Sean Hick, 33, had been charged with the 1990 shooting of Major Michael Dillon-Lee in Dortmund. The presiding judge said the trio were part of an IRA 'active service unit' on the European mainland, but this itself was not a crime in Germany. They were also acquitted for lack of evidence of attempted murder charges in the failed 1990 bombing of British army barracks at Langen Hagen, when a sentry disturbed armed attackers trying to prime some 100 pounds of Semtex explosives.

0,FT942-16011 ,"FT942-16011 _AN-EDMEUAGQFT 940412   FT  12 APR 94 / World Trade News: China 'must move further on rights'      By NANCY DUNNE      WASHINGTON   A senior US commerce department official yesterday said China would have to improve its human rights record further if President Bill Clinton was to renew its Most Favoured Nation trade status in June. China had made 'slow but discernible progress' in some areas, said Mr Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary for international trade, but the administration was 'deeply troubled' by the recent arrests of Chinese citizens. MFN status for China allows its goods the same tariff treatment as other US trading partners. Loss of MFN would be a big blow to both economies. Mr Garten was speaking at a US-China trade and investment conference in Los Angeles, attended by by Ms Wu Yi, China's minister for trade and economic co-operation. He welcomed as 'positive' a statement on the universal declaration of human rights, delivered by the Chinese foreign minister on April 6. Honouring the declaration is one of the seven criteria set out as a basis for MFN renewal by Mr Clinton last year. However, said Mr Garten, actions like the recent detentions and arrests of Chinese activists 'cast a cloud over our efforts to further co-operation between our two countries'. Mr Garten has been gaining a reputation as a thoughtful trade policy theorist. But he has been criticised for his enthusiastic embrace of US-China commercial relations as part of the department's aggressive export promotion policy. Critics say this has sent 'mixed messages' to Beijing. Yesterday, Mr Garten offered assurances that the US did not seek to infringe China's sovereignty and three times stressed to a government obsessed by stability that co-operation would lead to 'stable and prosperous' China. 'Our combined business skills and industriousness can create a powerful engine for economic growth,' he said. 'The potential benefits to both our countries in improving trade relations will be felt not only in commercial terms and economic security, but more broadly in a secure and stable Asian-Pacific region.' The US asked only for adherence to universally recognised human rights standards, which would provide 'a more stable and attractive climate for trade and investment'. Administration officials have recently indicated that there would be little problem in certifying progress on two of the most pressing criteria: emigration and prison labour. The US wants more information on political prisoners, and the round-up of dissidents is seen as a setback. There has been no improvement of conditions in Tibet, but China has promised to provide information on 106 Tibetan prisoners. US officials have also suggested that China's co-operation on MFN this year may bring an end to the annual renewal process. Mr Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state, said the administration hoped for a 'normal process' in the years ahead, ending the annual debate which has divided the Congress since the Tiananmen uprising. At present, China, as a non-market economy, must have its tariff status renewed by the president or it will expire on July 3. Congress has until September 1 to pass a joint resolution overruling the president, but he can veto that and it takes two-thirds of the House and Senate to override him.

The news on the first channel of  the French television that the Muslims committed the crime at  the Sarajevo market sounds cynical. It arrived, as always,  after everything [sentence as heard]. Russia has finally  stepped on the international political scene and -- through  offensive diplomacy at a very delicate moment -- stopped the  militant West. The Russian initiative, whose author is  President Yeltsin with his closest associates, would not have  worked, of course, had it not been met with full cooperation by  the Serb side. The triumph of Russian policy over the Western  arms should not only be temporary. As a serious country with  serious policies, Russia has now imposed on itself certain  obligations. Does that mean there will be a new balance of  power? Is this the beginning of a new era in international  relations with the new -- that is, old -- Russian factor?    According to CNN, 80 percent of the Russians in a poll  opposed the bombing of Serb positions. Again, according to CNN,  60 percent of the Russians believe that an attack on the Serbs  is an attack on Russia. The Russian Church also opposes air  strikes against Serb positions. Patriarch (Aleksey) II said  that even the thought of air strikes must be rejected. Of  course, the Russian initiative contains the views of Serbia's  policy, since -- as we could see -- Vitaliy Churkin, as Boris  Yeltsin's special envoy, spent most of his time in talks with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. So Serbia and the Serb  republic, or rather the Serb side, has been providing evidence  of the continuity of their peace-loving policy.    We will soon see whether the United States will use its  influence on the Muslim side, not only at this time but also in  the future. Izetbegovic promised that the Muslim artillery would  also be moved and silenced. This is a promise that will mean  nothing unless there is clear insistence on that by the  international community, particularly the United States, as  pointed out two days ago by Russian Foreign Minister Andrei  Kozyrev. The Russian minister stressed the obligations facing  the Muslim side. Russia has done its bit, now it is the turn of  the United States. The new peace negotiations will begin, no  doubt, with new territorial demands by the Muslim side. All  this has been staged for that reason, to strengthen the  negotiating position of the Muslims -- from the event on the  Sarajevo market to the threat of air strikes.    The threat of sanctions against Croatia, of course, remain  in  the media shadow of these events. Croatia was told to withdraw  its army from Bosnia by 17 February, as Butrus-Ghali reminded.  However, it is hard to believe that Germany and its bloc, which  is still very powerful, will allow sanctions to be introduced  against Croatia. That would be yet another example of  inconsistency and double standards of the international  community toward the protagonists in the crisis in the former  Yugoslavia.    Those who wanted to could have seen once again that had it  been up to the Serb side, the war would have stopped a long time  ago.     "

Responding to neighborhood complaints, a monthlong investigation into drug  dealing at the large townhouse development culminated Saturday when Los Angeles  County sheriff's deputies arrested 12 suspected drug dealers and 23 customers  at three homes in the 350-unit complex, said Sheriff's Sgt.

Deputies with search warrants went to the homes on Boothill, Geronimo and  Lariat lanes, where they seized 190 grams of marijuana, an undetermined amount  of money, five handguns and a rifle, Judge said. Ten men and two women -- whose  names were not available -- were arrested and booked on charges of possession  and sale of cocaine, he said.    After the alleged drug dealers were arrested, deputies posed as drug dealers  and began selling rock cocaine to unsuspecting customers around the complex,  Judge said.

Press Conference at Russian Defense Ministry""]    [Text] Russia's sensational political initiative in the  Balkans and the role that our Airborne Troops in the UN  peacekeeping forces played therein were discussed at a press  conference for Russian and foreign correspondents given 26  February by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the  Russian Armed Forces General Staff, and Colonel General Yevgeniy  Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne Troops.    From the moment that NATO presented the warring parties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina with an ultimatum, the Russian leadership has  taken a firm and unequivocal stance, Col. Gen. Mikhail  Kolesnikov told journalists, namely that a solution to the  Bosnian problem must be sought by peaceful, political means.  That is why, he went on to say, not only would the intended  aerial bombing of Serb positions not speed up the peace  settlement process but it might on the contrary stiffen the  sides' positions and lead to a fresh escalation of the war in  the Balkans.    The chief of the General Staff stressed that, by threatening  to carry out bombing raids on targets around Sarajevo, the NATO  command has thus put itself in an ambiguous position. It has  been publicly stated that the use of force should be the  instrument that will enable the situation around Sarajevo to be  normalized. In actual fact Western diplomats acknowledge that  bombing would be regarded in the North Atlantic Alliance as the  collapse of its strong-arm policy. That is why the alliance  greeted with relief the news that, owing to the efforts of the  Russian president and Russian diplomats, it had proved possible  to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms from  a 20-km zone around Sarajevo, while our ""blue helmets"" in the UN  peacekeeping forces acted as guarantors of this plan's  implementation.    The arrival of the Russian soldiers is a key element in the  implementation of Russia's plan for a political settlement of  the crisis in Bosnia, Col. Gen. Kolesnikov noted. No matter  what people in the West are now saying about the fear that the  NATO ultimatum has supposedly inspired in the Serbs, he said,  trust played a crucial role in the Serbs accepting our  proposals. ""The trust which they have in Russia and its  peacekeeping forces.""    The chief of the Armed Forces General Staff told journalists  that, in response to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's  proposals, the Russian president asked the Federation Council to  agree to allocate an additional troop contingent of 300 men to  participate in the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The upper  chamber of parliament took a positive view of this proposal 25  February. What is more, Col. Gen. Kolesnikov pointed out, the  Federation Council instructed the country's government on the  Russian Defense Ministry's submission to urgently resolve the  question of a pay raise for the personnel of the Russian UN  contingent in Yugoslavia. The Russian Defense Ministry in  conjunction with the Russian Foreign Ministry has also been  tasked with immediately formulating a system of social  guarantees for the personnel of the ""blue berets"" involved in  peacekeeping operations on Yugoslav territory.    Col. Gen. Kolesnikov said in conclusion that Russia is  starting to play a more active, autonomous role in settling the  crisis in the Balkans, bolstering its diplomatic efforts by  making a specific military and peacekeeping contribution. The  statements, initiatives, and actions by the Russian political  and military leadership and diplomats have once again proved  that it is not strong-arm but political means of settling the  Yugoslav conflict that are inexhaustible. And we will try to  stick to them in the future.    Col. Gen. Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne  Troops, who returned from Belgrade 24 February as part of a  government delegation, told journalists how Russia's proposed  plan for settling the Bosnian crisis is being implemented. A  key element in this plan was for Russian ""blue helmets"" to come  to Sarajevo within a limited period. Despite the mountainous  locality and the sudden snowfall, Col. Gen. Podkolzin said, a  convoy of combat hardware with 400 Russian Airborne Troops led  by Colonel Viktor Vorobyev arrived in Bosnia precisely on  schedule. The local population -- not only the Serbs, but also  the Croats and Muslims -- gave our Airborne Troops a cordial,  enthusiastic reception like the frontline soldiers in victorious  1945.    At present, journalists were told by the commander of the  Airborne Troops, our ""blue helmets"" are performing a  peacekeeping mission in the Bosnian capital's so-called buffer  zone between the opposing sides -- the Serbs and Muslims -- they  occupy 16 km of the front. They have also taken Sarajevo  Airport under guard along with the French ""blue helmets.""    With regard to the plan for our Airborne Troops' future stay  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Col. Gen. Podkolzin pointed out that they  form the backbone of the UN 2d Russian battalion, which will be  stationed in the Sarajevo region. As for the additional  contingent of 300 men, whose posting to Bosnia-Herzegovina has  been approved by the Federation Council, it will be sent in  mid-March. Thus, the total number of Russian ""blue helmets"" on  Yugoslav territory will shortly reach 1,500 officers, warrant  officers, and contract troops, which, according to the commander  of the Airborne Troops, will also help boost Russia's  peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans.    In response to your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent's question  regarding guarantees of our soldiers' safety in Bosnia, where  the 100,000-strong Muslim Army includes around 10,000 mojahedin  who fought in Afghanistan, the commander of the Airborne Troops  said that this was the main topic of conversation during his  meeting with British General Rose, commander of the UN forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, who gave assurances that all steps are  currently being taken to ensure the safety of the ""blue helmet""  contingent, including the Russians.    Other questions from journalists were also answered during  the press conference.     "

The meeting comes shortly before the UN Security Council is scheduled to review air, arms and diplomatic sanctions against Libya. The sanctions were imposed after Libya refused to hand over to the US or Britain two suspects in the explosion of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The bombing killed 270 people. Since the sanctions took effect on April 15, Egypt has been mediating between Libya and the west for a diplomatic solution that would forestall harsher penalties. Egypt and Libya are members of the Arab League and more than 1m Egyptians work or live in Libya.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "
0,FT934-5789 ,"FT934-5789 _AN-DK1ACAAAFT 931127   FT  27 NOV 93 / Lonrho to finance Libyan film about Lockerbie: Caribbean shell company set up for Pounds 633,000 documentary      By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD   Lonrho and the Libyan government have set up a Caribbean shell company to finance a Pounds 633,000 documentary film about the Lockerbie bombing. The disclosure of the secret partnership between the UK-based conglomerate and Libya in the film project comes just days before tough new United Nations sanctions against the country are due to come into force. These include a freeze on Libyan assets held abroad to in-crease pressure on it to hand over for trial in the west suspects accused of blowing up the Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives. The deal has prompted a further division between Mr Dieter Bock and his joint Lonrho chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland, who is responsible for Lonrho's involvement in the film. Mr Bock is known to be embarrassed by the Libyan connection and wants to minimise business dealings with the state. But Mr Rowland, who is currently abroad and was unavailable for comment yesterday, has accumulated what he believes to be evidence that Libya was not responsible for the bombing and has passed this to UK ministers. The film is being made by Mr Allan Francovich, a producer from the US who has made a number of highly praised documentaries about the US Central Intelligence Agency. It is being funded by Metropole Hotels, which is two thirds owned by Lonrho and one third by the Libyan Arab Finance Company, the main investment vehicle of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. Metropole has set up a wholly owned subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, called Hemar Enterprises. Hemar hired Mr Francovich as director and producer of a 90 minute television documentary, with a budget of Pounds 632,948. Metropole has deposited Pounds 105,000 of this into Hemar's account at Credit Suisse in Zurich, Switzerland. At a Metropole board meeting in August, members were told that talks had been held between the LAFC and Lonrho directors about the possibility of making a film on 'Libyan issues'. Mr Rowland then suggested that it should be financed by Metropole. One Metropole director, Mr Martin Bolland, said at the meeting that he was concerned at possible adverse publicity for the group. However, Mr Rowland - supported by Mr Smeida El Naili and Mr Mohamed Ali El Huwej, both of the Libyan Arab Finance Company - instructed that Hemar should be set up by Metropole and should have only three directors: himself; Mr Ken Etheridge, the former policeman who is head of security at Lonrho; and Mr El Naili. Mr Francovich said he had complete control of the project and could withdraw if there was any interference from Lonrho or the Libyans. He said he had already found out some 'incredible' details about the background to the bombing and that shooting would start in 'three or four weeks'. He has requested interviews with the alleged Libyan intelligence agents, Mr Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Mr Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, whom the UK and US governments want to try in connection with the bombing. Recently, Mr Rowland said he felt honour bound to work closely with Libya since selling it the Metropole stake for Pounds 177m in 1992.   Companies:-  Lonrho.     Metropole Hotels (Holdings).

0," LA051690-0101   219631    May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 1; Column 5; Foreign Desk      1006 words      RETALIATE AGAINST TERROR, FLIGHT 103 PANEL ADVISES      By DOUGLAS JEHL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      A presidential commission that investigated the bombing of Pan American Airways  Flight 103 urged the United States on Tuesday to retaliate for acts of  terrorism by launching military strikes or other punitive steps against  terrorists and the nations that support them.    While the panel sidestepped the question of whether such action ought to be  directed at Iran and Syria, the suspected sponsors of the 1988 attack,  commission Chairman Ann Dore McLaughlin declared: ""When the perpetrators are  found, they should be punished.""    The commission also concluded that a deeply flawed aviation security system  leaves the nation vulnerable to terrorist attack. It blamed Pan Am and the  Federal Aviation Administration for failing to enforce requirements that it  said could have prevented the catastrophic bombing.    And in a blow to what had been touted as a promising new safeguard, the panel  urged the government to halt deployment of hundreds of bomb detectors in  airports around the world. It concluded that the costly devices are incapable  of detecting sophisticated plastic explosives in the small quantity that blew  the London-to-New York jetliner and its 259 crew members and passengers from  the sky.    The 182-page document, drafted by a highly respected team that included four  members of Congress, offered a sweeping menu of reforms that it said could help  the nation better fend off such terrorist attacks in the future.    But in a grim conclusion certain to reopen a national debate, the commission  warned that such attacks will end only if the United States takes aggressive  new steps to strike back against terrorists and their sponsors -- even if  available evidence falls short of criminal standards of proof.    To that end, it recommended that the Bush Administration prepare to launch  direct military strikes against terrorist hideouts abroad. When such action  appears inappropriate, it urged that the government authorize covert operations  against the targets.    ""State-sponsored terrorism must be faced and must be deterred -- with methods  that are consistent with the nature of the threat and the U.S. system,"" said  the commission report, presented to President Bush by McLaughlin, a former  secretary of labor.    McLaughlin disclosed that the commission delivered to the President a separate  memorandum outlining more specific recommendations about an appropriate U.S.  response for the Pan Am attack. But the chairman declined further comment,  saying that the panel's advice would remain confidential.    The public call for retaliation won praise from most American family members of  those killed in the Pan Am 103 attack, but it was criticized by some British  relatives of those who perished when the jetliner crashed in Lockerbie,  Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 11 on the ground in addition to those on  the plane.    At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to comment on specific  recommendations, but he said: ""We certainly agree that we need to be as  aggressive as necessary to fight terrorism.""    U.S. intelligence officials believe that the Pan Am 103 bombing was carried out  by a Palestinian guerrilla leader with the support of Iran and, to a lesser  extent, Syria. But the seven-member President's Commission on Aviation Security  and Terrorism drew no public conclusions about responsibility for the attack.    Instead, with a focus on how the bombing occurred, it found fault at nearly  every level with the system designed to protect American air passengers from  terror in the sky. Among other conclusions, the panel found that:    Pan Am, in violation of FAA regulations, routinely neglected at its high-risk  airport in Frankfurt, Germany, to hand-search luggage not accompanied by a  passenger on the plane.    The FAA appeared to have condoned the security violations and never disciplined  Pan Am, even though its investigators warned before the Pan Am attack that the  airline's security system in Frankfurt was ""held together only by . . . the  tenuous threads of bad luck.""    Luggage from Pan Am 103 was left unguarded on a Heathrow Airport tarmac for  more than half an hour before being loaded aboard a Boeing 747 for the  London-to-New York leg of the flight, which originated with another plane in  Frankfurt.    In contending that the disaster could have been prevented, the McLaughlin  commission said that more aggressive measures might have intercepted the bomb,  secreted inside a Toshiba radio-cassette player, before it was loaded onto the  plane.    The commission found that at least one piece of unaccompanied luggage was  loaded onto the flight in Frankfurt after only an X-ray search -- a technique  incapable of detecting the deadly Semtex plastic explosive hidden inside the  radio.    The commission reported that the Pan Am security breach in Frankfurt  ""incredibly"" persisted for nearly nine months after the bombing.    But the panel aimed most of its criticism more broadly.

Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett noted that he disagreed with some of the  commission's criticisms of the airline but said that the report made several  positive recommendations.    In recommending that the FAA halt its $175-million program to supply Thermal  Neutron Analysis bomb-detection machines to 150 airports around the world, the  commission said that it believes the devices cannot detect small but deadly  quantities of plastic explosive without an unacceptably high rate of false  alarms.

While the panel sidestepped the question of whether such action ought to be  directed at Iran and Syria, the suspected sponsors of the 1988 attack,  commission Chairman Ann Dore McLaughlin declared: ""When the perpetrators are  found, they should be punished.""    The commission also concluded that a deeply flawed aviation security system  leaves the nation vulnerable to terrorist attack. It blamed Pan Am and the  Federal Aviation Administration for failing to enforce requirements that it  said could have prevented the catastrophic bombing.    And in a blow to what had been touted as a promising new safeguard, the panel  urged the government to halt deployment of hundreds of bomb detectors in  airports around the world. It concluded that the costly devices are incapable  of detecting sophisticated plastic explosives in the small quantity that blew  the London-to-New York jetliner and its 259 crew members and passengers from  the sky.    The 182-page document, drafted by a highly respected team that included four  members of Congress, offered a sweeping menu of reforms that it said could help  the nation better fend off such terrorist attacks in the future.    But in a grim conclusion certain to reopen a national debate, the commission  warned that such attacks will end only if the United States takes aggressive  new steps to strike back against terrorists and their sponsors -- even if  available evidence falls short of criminal standards of proof.    To that end, it recommended that the Bush Administration prepare to launch  direct military strikes against terrorist hideouts abroad. When such action  appears inappropriate, it urged that the government authorize covert operations  against the targets.    ""State-sponsored terrorism must be faced and must be deterred -- with methods  that are consistent with the nature of the threat and the U.S. system,"" said  the commission report, presented to President Bush by McLaughlin, a former  secretary of labor.    McLaughlin disclosed that the commission delivered to the President a separate  memorandum outlining more specific recommendations about an appropriate U.S.  response for the Pan Am attack. But the chairman declined further comment,  saying that the panel's advice would remain confidential.    The public call for retaliation won praise from most American family members of  those killed in the Pan Am 103 attack, but it was criticized by some British  relatives of those who perished when the jetliner crashed in Lockerbie,  Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 11 on the ground in addition to those on  the plane.    At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to comment on specific  recommendations, but he said: ""We certainly agree that we need to be as  aggressive as necessary to fight terrorism.""    U.S. intelligence officials believe that the Pan Am 103 bombing was carried out  by a Palestinian guerrilla leader with the support of Iran and, to a lesser  extent, Syria. But the seven-member President's Commission on Aviation Security  and Terrorism drew no public conclusions about responsibility for the attack.    Instead, with a focus on how the bombing occurred, it found fault at nearly  every level with the system designed to protect American air passengers from  terror in the sky. Among other conclusions, the panel found that:    Pan Am, in violation of FAA regulations, routinely neglected at its high-risk  airport in Frankfurt, Germany, to hand-search luggage not accompanied by a  passenger on the plane.

0,FT924-1681 ,"FT924-1681 _AN-CLQCFAAIFT 921217   FT  17 DEC 92 / West divided on using force in Bosnia      By ROBERT MAUTHNER      GENEVA   THE US yesterday called for 'more aggressive measures' by the international community against the Bosnian Serbs, but other countries opposed military intervention in the Bosnian conflict. In Paris, a French junior foreign minister, Mr Georges Kiejman, said the US was proposing the pre-emptive bombing of Serb targets in an effort to halt the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems, but that France and Britain opposed such a move. Instead, France and Britain supported the interception and, if necessary, the destruction of Serb aircraft which violated the United Nations Security Council's ban on flights over Bosnia. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary did not deny that such measures were being discussed at the UN and elsewhere, but stressed that no agreement had yet been reached. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, said in Paris yesterday he backed the use of force if necessary but he added it was vital that the EC and the UN continued to act together. Mr Beregovoy told parliament: 'The French government does not rule out any solution to bring the massacres to an end.' Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, Secretary of State in the outgoing US administration, addressing the 29-nation conference on the former Yugoslavia in Geneva, made no mention of a pre-emptive bombing proposal. But he specifically referred to the US and other governments' recommendation that the Security Council should authorise enforcement of the 'no-fly' zone in Bosnia and re-examine the arms embargo against Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Eagleburger said that it was essentially the Serbs who had broken the promises made at last August's London conference on the former Yugoslavia, which included commitments to ensure unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, to lift the siege of cities, to halt all military flights over Bosnia, to place all heavy weapons under UN monitoring and to shut down all detention camps. 'It is clear that the reckless leaders of Serbia, and of the Serbs inside Bosnia, have somehow convinced themselves that the international community will not stand up to them now and will be forced eventually to recognise the fruits of their aggression and the results of ethnic cleansing.' Both Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the two co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, counselled caution on military measures to enforce the ban on flights and came out firmly against a lifting of the arms embargo in favour of the Bosnian Moslems. Mr Vance recognised that breaches of the Security Council's no-fly zone resolution needed to be examined. But he emphasised that UNPROFOR, the UN protection force in the former Yugoslavia, had not detected any use of fixed-wing aircraft in support of combat operations in Bosnia-Hercegovina since the resolution was passed two months ago. Nor could it supply any confirmation of allegations that helicopters had been used in an offensive role. In deciding whether to employ military measures to enforce the flight ban, the Security Council had to take into account the risk of retaliatory action against UN troops and aid workers.

0," LA061189-0147   68903    June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 5; Foreign Desk      2194 words      400 ARRESTED AS CHINA GEARS UP TO CHOKE OFF DISSENT      By DAVID HOLLEY and DANIEL WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writers      BEIJING      As China's sophisticated apparatus of repression geared up to reassert strict  political controls, state-run television announced Saturday the arrests in  Beijing of more than 400 people.    Additional arrests were made elsewhere of protesters who fled the capital after  last weekend's martial-law crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, according  to the television report. These came in surrounding Hebei province, the cities  of Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other locations, it said.    Those arrested were accused of burning military vehicles, destroying other  government property, beating soldiers, stealing weapons, attacking government  agencies or spreading rumors.    Also on Saturday, China carried out its first expulsion of a foreign journalist  since the current crisis began, and authorities launched a harsh verbal attack  on the Voice of America, a key source of information about events here for many  Chinese listeners.      Propaganda Barrage    In a heavy propaganda barrage that began several days ago, the official media  outlets are portraying last weekend's bloody crackdown, which ended seven weeks  of escalating pro-democracy protests, as a response to violent  ""counterrevolutionary"" rioting.    This reverses the actual order of events. The weeks of pro-democracy  demonstrations, which began in mid-April, were nonviolent and usually festive.    The rioting, which involved heavy destruction of military vehicles and the  killing of some soldiers, came as a response to the deaths of hundreds or  perhaps thousands of unarmed people in Beijing as martial-law troops, using  automatic weapons and tanks, moved into the city a week ago Saturday night and  the next morning to clear protesters from Tian An Men Square.    Most deaths were of Beijing citizens who poured into the streets to try to  block the military assault on the square. A large majority of the several  thousand students who remained in the center of the square through the pre-dawn  hours Sunday -- and perhaps nearly all of them -- were allowed to leave shortly  before dawn. They left the southern side of the square and dispersed through  the city.    Foreign correspondents in Beijing generally remain uncertain about what  happened in the northern part of the huge square during the final half-hour  before dawn, as it appears that no foreigner was able to fully witness events  in the area during that critical period. Chinese who claim to be eyewitnesses  give conflicting reports about what happened.    What is absolutely clear is that hundreds of unarmed citizens were killed on  the western side of the city as advancing troops fought their way through  crowds, and that at least several dozen people were shot and killed on Changan  Avenue, at the north side of the square, during the early morning hours Sunday  before the protesters at the center of the square were forced south.    The Chinese Red Cross initially reported that night's death toll as 2,600, and  estimates widely circulated within the diplomatic community put the figure at  3,000 or more. The Chinese government, however, now insists that only about 300  people died and that the majority were soldiers.    It appears that proof of the true figures will never be obtained. Bodies have  already been cremated, and for Chinese to claim that the government figures are  wrong is now the martial-law crime of ""spreading rumors.""    Many of the destroyed military vehicles, including armored personnel carriers,  were abandoned during the day Sunday by troops presumed at the time to be  unwilling to kill unarmed citizens. It now appears that the vehicles may have  been ordered abandoned for the purpose of obtaining dramatic videotapes of  destruction by supposed counterrevolutionaries. These videotapes are now being  repeatedly shown on state-run television.      Propaganda Barrage    In Beijing, it appears that few people believe the government line. But the  current propaganda barrage may have a strong influence on people in outlying  provinces. Even for those who know the government reports are false, it has  become dangerous to publicly deny them. There are also severe, but somewhat  ambiguous, restrictions on foreign reporting on events in Beijing.    Some journalists were shot or beaten while covering the army's move into Tian  An Men Square last weekend, but none were killed or critically injured. In  recent days, authorities have issued vague warnings to foreigners that appear  aimed in part at chilling news coverage of the current wave of arrests. Some  correspondents have been issued specific warnings that they have violated  martial-law rules. But there has not been any concerted effort to impose a  genuine news blackout on the Chinese capital.    On Saturday, Peter Newport, a journalist with London-based Independent  Television News, was ordered out of China after trying to cover a student  protest in Shanghai, according to reports from that coastal city.    An ITN spokesman in London told Reuters news agency that police destroyed  Newport's videocassettes and gave him 24 hours to leave China. He later arrived  in Hong Kong, the agency said.      Tourist Visa    It appeared that the pretext on which Newport was expelled was that he was  working on a tourist visa, according to reports from Shanghai.    The government also issued harsh criticism Saturday of the Voice of America,  which beams English- and Chinese-language broadcasts to China. A letter said to  have been written by an unidentified teacher accused the radio station of false  reporting.    ""The teacher described the report by Voice of America as irresponsible, saying  that it aimed at instigating hatred and resistance,"" the official New China  News Agency said in a report. The letter was also published in the official  People's Daily newspaper and broadcast on state-run radio.    One of the martial-law press restrictions is that ""Chinese or foreign  journalists are strictly forbidden to utilize press coverage to make  instigating and inciting propaganda."" The wording of the letter thus appeared  aimed at preparing the groundwork for some sort of action against Voice of  America.    Another VOA attack came during the evening television news. A man identified as  a ""rumormonger"" was shown telling a foreign reporter and a small crowd of  listeners that martial-law troops had crushed and beaten people to death. He  first claimed to be an eyewitness, but then changed his story to say that he  had heard it on Voice of America. The scene concludes with the narrator  declaring: ""We hope the people will turn in rumormongers like him.""    The television news announcement on the arrests in Beijing reported that among  those detained was student leader Guo Haifeng. According to the report, he was  arrested at Tian An Men Square when he was about to use a gasoline-filled  bottle to try to set fire to an armored car.      Vigilant Residents    News announcers said that some student leaders had given themselves up or had  been turned in by vigilant residents of Beijing who answered a request to phone  in the whereabouts of ""inciters of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.""    The broadcast showed some of the detainees being led at gunpoint by a phalanx  of police into interrogation cells. Their heads were forced down by guards in a  ritual display of submission.    One by one, they sat forlornly in a corner, evidently giving self-incriminating  evidence to a pair of note takers. Then they were handcuffed and led away.    The media have identified most of those arrested simply as ""ruffians"" and  lawbreakers, and it is not clear how many are students. But it appears that  many, if not most, of those arrested so far are not students.    The arrests were viewed by foreign observers as a sign that government power  had been consolidated, at least for the moment. The night before, senior leader  Deng Xiaoping appeared on television in the company of hard-line conservative  leaders and a flock of army generals. Saturday's edition of the People's Daily,  the official Communist Party newspaper, and every other paper in the city  published a front-page picture of Deng alone shaking hands with army officers.    ""The message seemed to be that this is the man who controls the guns,"" said a  Western diplomat, referring to the photo.      Fall From Grace    Nothing has been heard of reformist leader Zhao Ziyang, who is technically  still the head of the Communist Party but who fell from grace for sympathizing  with student demands and opposing the crackdown.    The bulk of the arrests seemed to be carried out by combined police-army sweeps  in neighborhoods in Beijing. Soldiers have fanned out to all neighborhoods of  the city, converting what was once martial law in word only into a very visible  reality.    The government has taken pains to get the city back to normal after a week of  chaos, but most residents remained indoors. Bus service was renewed on a  limited basis, and many shops and factories remained closed. Most roads were  cleared of debris left from the popular resistance to the army's move on the  square.    Despite the wave of arrests and the more widespread positioning of martial-law  troops -- who stood 50 feet apart along some stretches of major roads and  engaged in foot patrols through other areas -- the random shootings of the past  few days subsided and it seemed reasonably safe Saturday to move through the  city.    Tian An Men Square, however, was blocked off except for city bus traffic  allowed to pass through its northern side along Changan Avenue.    Pedestrians and bicyclists who passed the southern side of the square gawked at  10 tanks parked to face them, but they were quickly shooed along by armed  soldiers if they paused too long.      Voice of Anguish    ""Why did they have to do this?"" one Chinese bicyclist said with anguish in her  voice as she passed the square. ""It was perfectly peaceful on June 3.""    Short convoys of empty troop trucks, usually about five vehicles long, moved  out of the city Saturday afternoon bearing banners declaring ""People's  Liberation Army rice-for-the-people transport team."" By early evening, the same  or similar trucks, apparently laden with supplies for the troops still  occupying Tian An Men Square, were parked behind the Great Hall of the People,  which faces the square.    Parked in the main part of the square Saturday evening were about 50 tanks and  about 300 apparently empty troop transport trucks. Soldiers armed with  automatic rifles stood guard at the four corners of the square, while a few  tanks and armored personnel carriers were positioned at two locations outside  but near the square.    A group of about 90 Americans were bused from the coastal city of Tianjin to  Beijing in a U.S. Embassy convoy, with the intention that they would  immediately leave the country from Beijing airport on a special flight. The  flight was delayed, however, for reasons that were not clear.    The diplomatic motorcade from Beijing had to leave one American couple behind.  The two had not completed the final legal formality for adoption of their  Chinese-born infant, and under U.S. law it was impossible to issue the child a  visa.    Another evacuee, Don Wycoff, a 39-year-old research chemist from St. Louis,  said repression of the student pro-democracy movement would cost China a whole  generation of future leaders.    ""The Chinese haven't had this kind of repression before,"" Wycoff said. ""Before,  it was political repression, with mass movements and all that. This time it was  sheer force by the police and army. It will take 15 years to repair the damage  -- at least.""    The U.S. Embassy in Beijing organized the motorcade to take the foreigners to  Beijing, where they could catch flights out of the country, after U.S. business  people stationed in Tianjin were unable to arrange transportation. John P.  Cragin, president of Management Technologies International Inc., a  Tianjin-based consulting firm, said the Americans were refused a special  flight, and when buses were privately chartered Thursday, police barred the  drivers from leaving.    ""We felt trapped here,"" said Cragin, whose home is in Los Angeles. ""They  wouldn't even let us on an empty plane.""    Saturday's television news showed Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong addressing a  meeting and calling for a moment of silence to honor the soldiers and police  officers who died during the assault on the square. He also accused those who  resisted the troops of having engaged in rioting.

By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NEW DELHI      Afghanistan's renegade defense minister, Shahnawaz Tanai, declared Thursday  that ""the fight is not over,"" but his bloody attempt to overthrow President  Najibullah's Soviet-backed government this week has driven deeper divisions  into the ranks of the regime's enemies, diplomats and independent analysts  said.    As shops, offices and the airport reopened in the Afghan capital of Kabul,  leaders of the Islamic guerrilla movement that has been battling the regime for  a decade from neighboring Pakistan rejected Tanai's appeal for an alliance.    ""How can we extend our support to a Communist?"" asked fundamentalist  moujahedeen leader Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, referring to Tanai, a veteran army  general and hard-liner who has bitterly opposed Najibullah's offer of  negotiations with the Islamic rebels for years -- until Wednesday's apparent  failure of his coup attempt.    Amid independent reports that Najibullah's forces had reclaimed control of all  major cities and installations, senior Pakistani officials also attempted to  distance themselves from Tanai, who was forced from his stronghold by heavy  fire and flew his family to safety in Pakistan aboard a commandeered Afghan  military helicopter Wednesday afternoon.    On Wednesday night, Pakistani authorities confirmed that Tanai had come to  Pakistan but, hours later, senior Foreign Ministry officials announced that he  had gone back inside Afghanistan with the moujahedeen rebels.    The moujahedeen's rejection of any alliance with Tanai and his remaining  mutinous forces came soon after that announcement, leading one Afghan expert to  comment, ""Everyone lost this one.""    The Islamic state of Pakistan has staunchly supported the moujahedeen since the  Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December, 1979. It has provided refuge to  more than 3 million Afghan refugees, harbored moujahedeen bases and  administered a multibillion-dollar U.S.-financed arms and ammunition pipeline  to the rebels.    On Thursday, though, the government in Islamabad appeared utterly confused  about the aftermath of the coup, which Najibullah has publicly charged was  engineered by the Pakistani military intelligence agency, the Interservices  Intelligence Directorate. That is the agency that has coordinated the  moujahedeen's logistics and administered the U.S. arms pipeline since the war  began.    In Washington, the State Department also appeared to have been blindsided by  the long-rumored coup attempt and its result, with senior officials telling a  congressional committee and journalists that the situation remains ""unclear"" or  ""confused.""    When Tanai's coup began, with devastating bombing runs on Najibullah's palace  and other key government buildings in downtown Kabul on Tuesday, both Islamabad  and other pro-moujahedeen governments appeared to be playing the role of  cheerleader.    Pakistani officials and Western diplomats in Islamabad told reporters early  Wednesday that Tanai's forces had taken over Bagram air base, 30 miles north of  Kabul, which is the regime's largest and most strategic air force installation.  Later they conceded that the base was, in fact, destroyed in aerial bombing  runs ordered by Najibullah.    On Thursday, they said there were unconfirmed reports that Soviet pilots had  flown the bombing runs on Bagram.    At the same time, though, the same sources added that heavy fighting was  reported around Kabul Airport, when, in fact, the airport was reopened Thursday  morning to both incoming military flights and outgoing civilian aircraft, none  of which encountered any fire.    Radio Kabul put the death toll at 56 and said 200 people were injured in the  fighting. It also reported that Najibullah had replaced four members of the  Supreme Defense Council, as well as Tanai. A diplomat based in Kabul quoted the  president as telling a news conference: ""The microbes, the radicals among us,  have been cleansed. We don't have any more factions. We are more united than  ever.""    Dazed passengers arriving in New Delhi on Thursday night on the first civilian  flight out of Afghanistan since the coup began confirmed that there had been no  damage to the airport and that life in the city had returned to normal.    In Pakistan, diplomats and senior officials declined to speculate on Tanai's  next move. All asserted that the Soviet-trained general's whereabouts are  unknown, although they insisted he is no longer on Pakistani soil.    Tanai himself said he was ""inside Afghanistan"" in the two-minute taped message  released by intermediaries in Islamabad on Thursday.    ""This is a call for Afghanistan's Muslim people and the army and the real  (ruling) party members,"" Tanai declared in a voice recognized by Western  reporters who have met him in Kabul. ""Najib(ullah) and his dictatorship will  fall. For this and for national unity, we have risen up.""    Initially, fundamentalist moujahedeen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar had come out  publicly in support of Tanai's coup. Independent analysts said that was, at  best, a tactical alliance between a hard-line Stalinist and a committed Islamic  fundamentalist. Pakistani authorities even said Tanai spoke with Hekmatyar on  Wednesday after he fled his rebel base.    But, on Thursday, Sayyaf, who has sided with Hekmatyar in the past, flatly  rejected Tanai's call for support saying, ""He is no different than Najib.""    The public split between the two most fundamentalist leaders of the already  fractious, seven-party moujahedeen alliance served only to deepen the disunity  that has plagued the rebels in their bid to overthrow Najibullah.    Deep divisions between the fundamentalists and moderates in the moujahedeen  also led the failure of last year's ill-fated attempt to form a representative  government-in-exile in Pakistan.    When asked about the effect of Tanai's coup on the rebels, though, most Western  diplomats said Thursday that Najibullah is the biggest loser.    In crushing the coup, the Afghan leader was forced to kill veteran air force  pilots and destroy a key air base. Military analysts said that his uncertain  control over the air force, which participated heavily in the coup attempt, has  left his counterinsurgency machine crippled, at best.

So says a Russian Foreign  Ministry statement circulated at UN headquarters in New York as  a Security Council document.    The first day of open debate on the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina demonstrated the three fundamental approaches  taken by the NATO member countries, Russia, and the Muslim  countries. The NATO countries' stance has not changed, they  still insist that the decision to carry out air strikes does not  require additional approval from the Security Council.  Evidently NATO will continue to disregard Russia's  diametrically opposed stance by preparing to undertake the first  ever military operation outside the bloc's zone of  responsibility. The representatives of the Muslim leadership of  Bosnia, and of Iran and Turkey, reflected the Muslim side's  stance in their speeches. They insisted that NATO attack  Serbian positions not only in Sarajevo but also in other parts  of Bosnia.    In all probability no one now knows how to coordinate the  largely polarized notions of a Bosnian settlement without  splitting the Security Council along cold war lines. A great  deal will depend on the actions taken by the conflicting sides  in Sarajevo over the next few days. Russia's proposal to  immediately convene the Security Council to examine practical  ways of demilitarizing Sarajevo and introducing a UN  administration there could, evidently, be a compromise solution.  That allows the NATO countries and Russia ""to stick with their  friends,"" so to speak, while resolving what is the main task at  this stage -- the demilitarization of the Bosnian capital.  Russia did incidentally submit this initiative long before the  present deterioration in the situation in Bosnia and, had it  been accepted by its Western partners in a timely fashion, it  might have been possible to avoid the bloody drama in Sarajevo's  market that spurred NATO to decide on bombing raids. Real moves  to transfer Sarajevo to UN control could remove the threat of  air strikes.    Nonetheless the way to secure a lasting peace in Bosnia lies  in the formulation by the main interested parties -- the United  States, the EU, and Russia -- of a unified concept of a  political solution to the conflict. This was stated at the  Russian State Duma hearings Tuesday. Indeed, if these sides  want to keep Bosnia-Herzegovina as a unified state and member of  the United Nations they should first remember that after World  War II this republic was a state with three peoples -- Serbs,  Croats, and Muslims -- where all vital decisions were adopted by  consensus alone. Consequently, it is inadmissible at any stage  in the settlement process to take anyone's side in the conflict,  which may result in the escalation of the conflict. At the  moment the Muslim side alone benefits from the bombing threats.  The proposal made by the United States and most Islamic states  that the embargo on arms shipments to Bosnia be lifted is also  untenable since this means shipments of arms to the Bosnian  Muslims alone.    The latest news from Sarajevo is depressing. Serbian forces  have stopped handing over heavy arms to the ""blue helmets"" and  are demanding UN monitoring of the numerically superior Muslim  infantry. In its turn, the Muslim leadership is not showing  willingness to do this.     "

Military presence was felt throughout the city. Convoys of trucks and foot  soldiers patrolled by day. More than 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers  rumbled through the center of Beijing after dark.    The Foreign Ministry advised embassies to keep staff members indoors at night  but did not impose a curfew.      Democracy Demonstration    In central Shanghai Friday, a day after Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji issued a  warning that illegal disruptions will no longer be tolerated, about 50,000  people staged a pro-democracy protest.    Student leaders also demanded that flags on public buildings be flown at  half-staff to mourn the deaths in Beijing and that a dialogue be established  between students and Shanghai government officials. There was no word on the  government's reaction.    Meanwhile, state television showed soldiers patrolling Chengdu, in the  southwest, and the ruins of a department store burned by protesters. Police  were shown making arrests in Wuhan and Harbin, two of the cities where crowds  burned buses and blocked roads.    A Chinese witness said police, in their pursuit of suspect intellectuals, had  searched one hotel room by room for a suspect, who was not identified.    ""We live now under terror,"" a student said.

On the evening television news, he was shown with other conservative leaders,  including Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun, posing for a picture  with senior military officials at Communist Party headquarters.    The officials stood for a minute of silence in tribute to soldiers who died ""in  putting down a counterrevolutionary rebellion"" last weekend, the official news  agency Xinhua reported.

More than 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers  rumbled through the center of Beijing after dark.

Democracy Demonstration    In central Shanghai Friday, a day after Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji issued a  warning that illegal disruptions will no longer be tolerated, about 50,000  people staged a pro-democracy protest.    Student leaders also demanded that flags on public buildings be flown at  half-staff to mourn the deaths in Beijing and that a dialogue be established  between students and Shanghai government officials. There was no word on the  government's reaction.    Meanwhile, state television showed soldiers patrolling Chengdu, in the  southwest, and the ruins of a department store burned by protesters.

0,FT934-12665 ,"FT934-12665 _AN-DJZDHABVFT 931026   FT  26 OCT 93 / IRA explosion causes rail chaos in south: Bomb damage delays 40,000 commuters - Belfast holds silent memorial / Ulster's economic image dented      By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent   THE IRA brought chaos to rail travellers in southern England yesterday as a result of Sunday's bomb explosion at Reading on the main line from London Paddington to the west and south Wales. It was feared that there would be further chaos today after an explosive device damaged a road bridge over the London Marylebone to Banbury line at Brill, Buckinghamshire, yesterday. British Rail said last night that the Reading line reopened during the day but the stretch of track between Princes Risborough and Bicester on the Marylebone-Banbury line remained closed and passengers were being bussed between the two towns. There was uncertainty about whether the line would be open by this morning. A third line from Reading to London Waterloo and the spur to Gatwick Airport remained closed because of signalling damage, BR said. This line had been replaced with a bus service between Earley and Wokingham in Berkshire but services were expected to be back to normal in time for this morning's rush-hour. Police were 'keeping an open mind' about the Brill explosion but did not know when the blast happened. They were not linking the explosion with the one in Reading late on Sunday night and, together with bomb squad officers, were planning a further examination of the track in daylight. BR urged passengers and people living close to railway lines to watch out for anything suspicious. Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, said after visiting the scene of the Reading blast: 'Let's face it, our lines are exposed. What we need is vigilance by everybody concerned.' Thames Valley police said train spotters and station security cameras could hold vital clues in the search for the terrorists who targeted Reading. The trackside explosion came seven hours after a device was found in a toilet. Police believe this device was meant to go off afterwards, hitting emergency services summoned to the scene. 'This was a deliberate attempt to lure emergency services into the path of an explosion with total disregard for human life,' said Det Supt John Bound. The blast damaged a signal post and caused a crater up to 18 inches deep but it was not thought the track itself was damaged. BR said 40,000 people using the main rail link to London from the west and south Wales were delayed by about an hour yesterday. Police said a warning was given about the Reading bomb, claiming it to be the work of the IRA. Another device was made safe on Sunday at Basingstoke station in Hampshire. Thousands of workers in Belfast downed tools yesterday to join a silent tribute to the victims of Saturday's IRA bombing in the Shankill Road. About 6,000 workers - the vast majority Protestants - from the Harland and Wolff shipyard and the Shorts aerospace factory marched across the city for a service of remembrance outside the Methodist church next to the site of the bombed fish shop. The service was arranged at the request of shop stewards from the two factories. A 22-year-old Catholic taxi driver shot in Belfast hours after the Shankill Road bombing died in hospital yesterday, police said.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

A manhunt started near Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, after special constable Glenn Goodman, 37, and PC Alexander Kelly, 32, were shot with a semi-automatic rifle when they stopped a car in a routine check. Glenn Goodman died later in hospital and PC Kelly was seriously injured. The red Ford Sierra eluded a police chase and was found burning in a field. The shooting came only three hours after a small bomb had gone off outside the Festival Hall. It caused little damage and no casualties.  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "
0,FT944-446 ,"FT944-446 _AN-EL2CVAAEFT 941229   FT  29 DEC 94 / Russian forces tighten hold on Chechen capital: Moscow denies continued bombing of Grozny      By JOHN LLOYD      MOSCOW   Russian forces and aircraft stepped up their attacks on the Chechen capital of Grozny yesterday in what was reportedly the most bitter fighting so far in the 17-day war. In Moscow, officials denied that the town was bombed after a promise from President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday of a pause in the air raids. Reports from Grozny, though, said bombing of the outskirts had continued and that an orphanage had been hit, with no casualties. The Russian government's press service said its forces were making 'real advances' towards Grozny's outskirts, 'carrying out the task of closing and tightening the circle round the Chechen capital'. Mr Yeltsin said in his address to the nation on Tuesday that the circle around Grozny had already been tightened. Chechen officials confirmed the increased level of fighting, with the press service reporting that the Russian army 'is trying to storm the city today'. That was denied in Moscow by Mr Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Security Council, which advises the president on security matters. But he admitted that the village of Petropavlovskaya to the east of Grozny, and Khankala airport near the city, had both been taken. The raids and the increased military activity appeared to rule out the slim hope - proposed by Mr Yeltsin - of the resumption of negotiations between Russian and Chechen officials. Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the Russia's Choice group and Mr Yeltsin's harshest critic on the liberal wing of politics, said he was 'sorry that President Yeltsin lost this chance of seriously promoting negotiations that could lead to peace'. Mr Gaidar, a long-time supporter of Mr Yeltsin even after most other reformist politicians had given up on the president, gave an exceptionally pessimistic review of the Chechnya crisis to journalists. He said Mr Yeltsin was receiving false information, was 'not in overall control' and had ceded authority to 'those who are against Russian democracy'. The cost of the war would break the budget, rendering any aid from the International Monetary Fund useless and destroying the government's macro-economic policy - designed to attract more than Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.6bn) in aid from the IMF and the World Bank in the coming year, he said. 'It is inevitable that military expenditure will increase, the powers of the police will increase, human rights won't be honoured, civilian institutions will be marginalised and the press won't be as free as it was,' he added. The signs are that Mr Yeltsin and the forces commanders are now seeking a rapid end to the military operation. The Russian parliament has begun its new year break, depriving deputies of a forum for dissent over the action in Chechnya. However, the leaderships of both houses of parliament, who are ex-officio members of the Security Council, essentially support the continuation of the war. Mr Ivan Rybkin, leader of the State Duma or lower house, said yesterday that he 'supports the president in his actions against the bandit gangs' - although he said a storming of Grozny should be avoided. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, leader of the Federation Council or upper house, has, with many reservations, taken the same line and is to face a vote of no confidence as a result.

But after reviewing the cases, prosecutors decided that there was no evidence  the men intended to interfere with business.

Information Minister Michel Samahah, who announced the  measures at the end of a five-hour cabinet meeting on Wednesday,  accused Israel of colluding with Lebanese parties in a bid to  destabilise Lebanon.    The government charged that Israel was carrying out  ""terrorist activities in a bid to harm unity and peace in  Lebanon, and the chances of peace in the region.""    Samahah said that the media ban would take effect from  midnight Wednesday until the government can come up with a law  to regulate the media in Lebanon.    The cabinet would meet next Tuesday to discuss the  legislation, he said.    But until then news coverage would be strictly limited to  state-run Radio Liban [Beirut Radio Lebanon] and Tele Liban.  Radio and television stations that violate the ban will be shut  down, Samahah said.    The unprecedented moves came after Lebanese police arrested  on Wednesday Fu'ad Malik, the second-in-command of the Lebanese  Forces (LF), a militia disbanded at the end of the 1975-1990 war  which had become a political party.    Malik was taken into custody in connection with the bombing  of a church last month in which 10 worshippers were killed. The  judge investigating the attack identified seven other suspects  as members of the LF.    The measures amount to ""an unofficial declaration of a state  of emergency in the country,"" a government official told the  independent Arabic-language newspaper AL-NAHAR.    ""It's a counter-coup to the coup which would have taken  place  if plans for destabilisation had been successful,"" he added.    ""Good for them. The Lebanese Forces made us cower in  shelters for 20 years while they destroyed the country,"" a taxi  driver said about the former militia's involvement in the  Lebanese war.    He also applauded the decision to ban private news program  saying: ""We've been poisoned by too many news bulletins each  day, too many radios giving their opinion. It's just as well.""    But opposition MP Najah Wakim warned that he will try to  fight the government's media ban, stressing that it was an  infringement on political freedoms.    ""The right to broadcast news should not be confined to the  state run media only. Every radio and television has the right  to broadcast news,"" he said.    The Lebanese press hailed the measures while Lebanon's 20  radio and television stations -- except for the pro-Israeli  Voice of the South -- complied with the ban, which also covered  political talk shows.    LF radio, Voice of Free Lebanon [(Clandestine) Radio Free  Lebanon], and their television, Lebanese Broadcasting  Corporation, broadcast music instead of its scheduled news  bulletins.    Sawt al-Sha'b [(Clandestine) Voice of the People], run by  the  Communist party, issued a statement saying it would abide by the  ban but urged the authorities to take immediate steps to issue a  law regulating the media in Lebanon.    Authorities earlier this month lashed out against private  stations for leaking findings of the investigation into the  bombing of Our Lady of Deliverance church north of Beirut.    They charged that some private media, which flourished  during  the country's civil war, were spreading rumors that it said  could fan disputes between the country's Moslem and Christian  communities.

0,FT944-160 ,"FT944-160 _AN-FAAACAAPFT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / West tells Russia of concern over Chechnya      By JUDY DEMPSEY, JUREK MARTIN and JOHN THORNHILL      BERLIN, WASHINGTON, MOSCOW   Germany, speaking as president of the European Union, told Russia yesterday of the EU's strong concern over the bloodshed in Chechnya, and questioned Moscow about what further moves it was planning. 'There was an expression of concern about civilian casualties, and a request for information,' said a government official in Bonn, referring to yesterday's call on the Russian Foreign Ministry by Mr Otto von der Gablentz, Germany's ambassador to Moscow. Mr Thomas Pickering, the US ambassador in Moscow, also visited the Russian ministry and discussed both Chechnya and Russian-American relations. Mr Igor Ivanov, a deputy foreign minister, briefed him on Russia's intentions in Chechnya. The diplomatic initiative by Germany - which hands over the EU presidency to France tomorrow - came at the end of a week in which western comment on Chechnya has hardened, albeit without threatening Russia-west relations. In both the US and western Europe, officials have expressed dismay over the fact that Russian forces are killing civilians and have broken promises to stop bombing soft targets. In Washington, the State Department for the first time directly criticised Russian tactics in Chechnya and urged an end to attacks on civilians. It said it was 'deeply disturbed' by reports of the bombing of an orphanage. This marks a change of emphasis from the west's initial comments on the crisis, which held out the hope of a peaceful settlement and stressed that the crisis was a domestic one. However, most western commentary is still stopping short of any assertion that Chechnya will affect the overall relationship between Russia and the west. At the UK Foreign Office, diplomats said it was too early to say what effect the conflict would have on broader ties. Like most of his western counterparts, Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, stresses that the conflict between Moscow and Grozny is an internal affair. However Mr Kinkel faces mounting criticism from the opposition Social Democrats, and the Free Democrats, the junior coalition partner. There are also senior members of the ruling Christian Democratic party who want Bonn to take a far more critical stance towards President Boris Yeltsin. This week Mr Kinkel held an hour-long telephone conversation with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart. But officials said Mr Kozyrev gave no commitments on a political solution. German and other western officials have expressed concern over the effect of the crisis on Turkey, where sympathy for the Chechens - and fears of a western 'sell-out' to Moscow - run high. In a year-end interview with news agencies, President Bill Clinton took a softer line, describing the conflict as 'an internal Russian political problem'. Moscow, he said, was facing 'a secessionist movement and they are dealing with it as best they can'. In spite of its generally tougher tone, the State Department stopped well short of linking the Chechen conflict to the broader US-Russian relationship. This was markedly strained at this month's European security summit, although since then the US has tried to limit the damage. But domestic criticism that the administration is giving too much of a green light to Russian action in Chechnya is mounting. Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national security adviser, has urged a rapid expansion of Nato regardless of Russian sensibilities. Also Mr Lee Hamilton, outgoing chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, disagreed with the US description of the assault on Chechnya as 'an internal matter'.

0,FT944-26 ,"FT944-26 _AN-FAAACAEFFT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / Sport: The Cup that blotted out the fun - War and Peace (Playing fields and battlefields) / It was the year of the World Cup and the Winter Olympics, the bung and the bribe. Peter Berlin reviews the events of 1994      By PETER BERLIN   The World Cup has grown so large that it blots out the sun for five weeks and throws into shade other sports events for months before and after. But around the orgy of marketing and broadcasting there was a normal sporting year, with an abnormal number of extreme highs and lows. The Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, in February opened in a blaze of publicity after Nancy Kerrigan, a figure skater, was attacked with a crow bar during the US trials by Jeff Gillooly, the husband of her chief rival Tonya Harding. Kerrigan lost at the Olympics to Oksana Bayul of the Ukraine. In Britain, 24m people tuned in to watch Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean try in vain to regain the Olympic ice dance title. Instead, the hero of the games was the impossibly noble Norwegian Johan Olav Koss, an Easter Island man on blades, who won three golds and set three world records. The unfancied Welsh won the five nations championship in rugby, though nobody could quite work out how they did it. Wigan won the double in rugby league. But the visits of the Australian rugby league team and the South African union side suggested that the centre of gravity in both sports remains firmly in the southern hemisphere. The balance of power in golf is also shifting south of the equator. Nick Price of Zimbabwe won the Open and the US PGA. While Ernie Els of South Africa won five tournaments, including the US Open, and a record Pounds 1.8m. Cricket had its share of heroes and villains. Brian Lara broke Sir Garfield Sobers' test scoring record with 375 against England in Antigua in April, then joined Warwickshire, helping them to win three trophies, and scoring 501 against Durham at Edgbaston. The England Test team continued to reel from crisis to crisis, pausing only to raise their fans' expectations cruelly with competent performances against West Indies in Barbados, where Alec Stewart scored two centuries, and against South Africa at the Oval, where Devon Malcolm took nine wickets for 57 runs to save the series. The nadir among many low spots was the unseemly matter of the dirt in captain Mike Atherton's pocket. The England team finished the year supine at the feet of Shane Warne, the Australian spin bowler. The Formula 1 drivers' championship was decided in the last Grand Prix in Adelaide where Michael Schumacher collided with Damon Hill at speed. Schumacher was widely accused of crashing deliberately to preserve his lead in the championship. Like all the drivers, Schumacher is acutely aware of the dangers of losing control. The whole season was raced under a pall after Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger died in much-replayed crashes. If Schumacher was so desperate to win that he was prepared to risk being a posthumous champion, then he has crossed the line between bravery and lunacy. Perhaps the anti-blood sports league should found a branch to protect humans. It could demonstrate at grand prix circuits, American football games and boxing matches. Boxing resembles professional wrestling more every year. But wrestling has better costumes, fitter performers and more plausible fights. Twenty years ago in Kinshasa, a superbly fit 25-year-old faced Muhammad Ali, 32 and deemed to be over the hill, for the world heavyweight title. Ali won. George Foreman lost. It is a measure of how far boxing has decayed that in November, Foreman, now an overweight, bald, grandfather, regained the heavyweight crown. It is easy to understand why Frank Bruno was so willing to foresake pantomime in search of yet another last boxing pay-day, since there is less and less difference between the two. Tennis also needs a serious heavyweight champion. Martina Navratilova retired; Monica Seles refused to unretire; Steffi Graf often played as if she was thinking of retiring; and Jennifer Capriati, retired, was arrested in a drugs raid, and then came back. The WTC raised the minimum age for players to protect them from burning out. It then waived the rules to admit two 14-year-olds with star quality: Martina Hingis and Venus Williams. Pete Sampras finished the year as men's number one. He is the leader of an elite of hard-working young men without charisma who hit the ball very hard. The exception is Andre Agassi, who returned after a five-month lay-off and won the US Open unseeded, pleasing those who still believe in genius. The apex of the soccer year was not the World Cup final but the European Cup final in May. Milan swept aside Barcelona 4-0 with a performance that seemed to herald a new era for the club and the sport. Instead, the club's fortunes have mirrored those of its owner, Silvio Berlusconi. In the autumn, Milan lost the World Club final to Velez Sarsfield, a poor and unglamorous club from Buenos Aires. The World Cup in the US opened well. Fifa, world soccer's governing body, had, it seemed, got it right. The stadiums were full; the referees enforced new, harsher laws and, as a result, goals and play flowed. A darker note entered in the second round after Diego Maradona was expelled for drug-taking and Andreas Escobar was shot after scoring an own goal which helped eliminate Colombia, one of the pre-tournament favourites. Matches were staged at midday or in mid-afternoon to accommodate European television viewers, and the soccer began to suffer. Players had to work in conditions that ran from sweat-shop (New York), through steel-foundry (Dallas) to Turkish bath (Orlando). Teams that had spent five weeks playing in steam ran out of it in the end. The final was a weary spectacle. It yielded no goals and was decided by the inability of the cramped legs of Franco Baresi and Roberto Baggio to keep their penalties down. The finals still yielded rich memories: Baggio's last-minute heroics, George Hagi's guile, Hristo Stoichkov's explosiveness, Saeed Owairan's unorthodoxy, Romario's gift for the unexpected, the Nigerian mix of delicacy and power, the attacking teamwork of the Spaniards.

The legislation, which President Bill Clinton strongly supports and will sign, was prompted by actions taken against abortion clinics in recent years, including cases of arson, bombing and, last year, the murder of a doctor in Florida and the shooting of another in Kansas. The bill, laying out penalties for offenders, was vigorously opposed by the right-to-life movement on the grounds that it infringed lawful civil disobedience. But the only concession was to grant similar protection to houses of worship. Opponents of abortion suffered a second, if less decisive, defeat yesterday when a House subcommittee voted against excluding abortion coverage from the healthcare bill.

However, the Panamanian head of state denied Italian reports  that arrests were made in his country in connection with  ""Unigold"" operation, which on Wednesday destroyed a network that  laundered $100 million monthly from the sale of Colombian  cocaine in the United States through large amounts of gold sent  to Panama.    In statements to EFE, Endara said that according to the  security reports he has received, an international operation was  conducted with the participation of Italian police, and although  Panama ""was not directly involved, it was kept informed of the  situation by other agencies.""    The cooperation, Endara added, was ""at the level of  information,"" which the Italians did not request directly but  received through unidentified organizations.    Endara said he does not believe that these kinds of  drug-related activities affect the international image of  Panama, whose international banking system and Free Trade Zone  have been considered by U.S. counternarcotics experts as ""very  vulnerable"" to money laundering.    ""This happens in all countries, and we always cooperate when  asked,"" the president stressed.    According to reports by authorities, the network dismantled  in Italy was led by Colombian citizen Gustavo Jesus Upegui  Delgado, former accountant of late Medellin Cartel chief Pablo  Escobar and currently one of the main financial leaders of the  ""Cali Cartel."" Upegui has been arrested in Vicenza (northeast  part of the country). Seven Italian businessmen were arrested in  Vicenza and Arezzo on charges of participating in the money  ""laundering"" network.    Reports from Italy said that four other unidentified people  were arrested in Panama, but Endara asserted that no arrests had  been made in his country in connection with ""Unigold"" operation.    Italian authorities began the investigation last June after  receiving a lead from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA).    According to reports from Italy, the dismantled gang used  ""narcodollars"" to buy some 1,000 kg of gold bars per month,  which were sent to Panama, where they were resold and the  ""laundered"" money wired to the Cali Cartel in Colombia.    Alessandro Pansa, director of the operation and one of the  individuals responsible for the Central Operation Center of  Italy's Criminal Police, said in his country that the  trafficking operations were so large that they threatened to  alter the gold market.    Endara said that unlike other countries, Panama does not  control the sale of gold, which ""comes and goes without a  problem.""    Italian investigators identified three corporations, all  based in Arezzo, as the owners of bank accounts where the  ""narcodollars"" were sent. The corporations are Simar Joyeros  Mayoristas, which has an outlet in Panama, Aurea Trading  International, and Eurocatene.    Panamanian sources at Simar Joyeros Mayoristas told EFE that  their corporation had not participated in any drug money  laundering operation, that no employee had been arrested, and  that last year an investigation conducted by the Panamanian  Customs Directorate cast no doubts on the corporation's  activities.    According to government sources, the jewelry corporation in  Panama is owned by Saul Schwartz, a Jewish businessman who on 1  June was kidnapped under strange circumstances by unidentified  individuals who released him uninjured after an unspecified  ransom was paid through a rabbi.

The Foreign Office and UN diplomats said the statement fell short of demands to hand over the men and that Britain, the US and France would proceed tomorrow with the tabling of a proposed UN resolution to stiffen sanctions against Tripoli. The Libyan statement said that Libya was not against the two men standing trial in a Scottish court and added: 'We urge them to accept that'. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said: 'If they come forward and are handed over, then that will change the situation and sanctions can be suspended. If not, after the expiry of the deadline on October 1 we will ask the Security Council to impose new sanctions.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     LYZ  Libya, Africa.

The federal government is putting out the welcome mat at a remote gunnery range  twice the size of Delaware and often as inhospitable as a Gila monster, even  when nobody's shooting.    Indeed, contradictions abound at the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range, a  2.7-million-acre preserve in the southwestern corner of Arizona. Described as  the Free World's largest target range, it encompasses seven areas where  fighters strafe and bomb simulated trains, convoys and missile bases and three  others where pilots practice dogfights.    An information packet, which includes an agreement absolving the military of  any harm to the visitor, refers to unexploded ordnance dating back to the 1940s  and warns that ""munitions items are designed to maim and kill.""    Some of the range is so inhospitable that Spanish explorers named an east-west  trail El Camino del Diablo -- ""The Devil's Road."" Historians estimate that  hundreds have died of fatigue or dehydration in remote parts of the range over  the centuries.    ""There's evidence out there of at least 40 old graves along the route,"" said  1st Lt. Michele S. Monroe, chief of a natural resource management unit at Luke  Air Force Base outside Phoenix.    But she said the range also is ""an irreplaceable national treasure,"" a trove of  biological wonders and opportunities for hikers, backpackers, hunters and  prospectors in a landscape that varies from post-Armageddon flats to a rich  overlay of plant life on bacon-colored peaks.    A civil engineer, Monroe won the Department of Defense's prestigious Natural  Resource Conservation Award in 1988 for projects to study the endangered  Sonoran pronghorn antelope, to build eight water-catchment basins among the  crags and to repair damage to El Camino del Diablo.    Thanks in part to the concrete dams that seal off rock-walled washes to collect  up to 50,000 gallons each during rainy periods, the range's herds of desert  bighorn sheep are on the increase, she says.    Aircraft avoid the 822,000-acre Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, run by  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and studies indicate that the animals  closer to bombing areas have adjusted, Monroe says.    ""I've been told by bighorn hunters who have been out there during a sonic boom  that the sheep may look up from eating, but they don't bolt and run,"" she says.      Natural Wonders    Dick Thomas, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management office in Phoenix,  says he was surprised by the natural wonders detailed in a new land-use plan  produced by his agency.    ""I've lived in Phoenix for 35 years, and I thought that was one big flat where  they'd bombed the hell out of the scenery since 1941,"" he says.    Despite the live bombs sometimes dropped, the Air Force, which operates on the  east end, and the Marines in the west, have kept most of the range pristine,  says Carole K. Hamilton, the BLM's area manager.    ""The public image of a bombing range may be misplaced in this case, because  most of the ground has not been blown up,"" Hamilton says. ""A lot of people  think this is one of the cleanest areas in terms of not having a lot of brass  on the ground, target drones and other debris.""    The plan calls for protection not only of flora and fauna, but of geologic  formations -- dunes near Yuma -- and historic and prehistoric sites. The plan  was developed under the Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986.    Congress reserved the range and five others for the next 15 years, changed its  name to honor Goldwater, a senator from Arizona and the 1964 Republican  presidential nominee, and designated the BLM to manage resources everywhere but  on the Cabeza Prieta.    The plan notes that the primary mission of the range is to train pilots and  aerial gunners for the Air Force, and for the Navy through the Marine Corps Air  Station at Yuma.    But it also calls for limited, on-road recreational use and for creation of  areas of ""critical environmental concern"" and special management.      Entry Registration    Visitors are required to register at one of several entry points, stay on  established roads and telephone the military when they leave the largely  unfenced range. The entry checkpoints give visitors an information kit with  maps clearly marking target areas.    In addition, the military never uses the range on Saturdays or Sundays, when  public use is highest.    Lt. Col. Stephen M. Roberts, commander of the 832nd Combat Support Squadron at  the Gila Bend Auxiliary Field, foresees few problems with greater public use of  the preserve.    ""We do have some instruments out there that we don't want moved or molested,""  Roberts says. ""Some are calibrated. But our greatest concern about increased  public use would be illegal or unauthorized off-road vehicle use.""    Visitors also could wander into a target zone, interrupting the training. And  those who forget to telephone when leaving could find themselves assessed for  search expenses or barred from the range for a year.    Maj. Wayne St. John, Roberts' operations officer, says the sheer size of the  range, and the maps and instructions in the visitors' kit, preclude  unintentional visits to gunnery areas.    ""There's plenty of federal property out there that's not used as gunnery  range,"" he says. ""Three-fourths of it is not.""    Roberts says a greater problem has been motorists shooting holes in warning  signs on the fences along state Route 85.    Cutting the public off from much of the southwestern corner of Arizona has  produced some quirky reactions in the past.    In 1941, ranchers grazing livestock on what was to become the bombing range  refused to vacate the land until nearly three weeks after Pearl Harbor, when a  federal court overrode provisions of a grazing law and authorized the military  to take possession.    Through the years, word got out that money was to be made recycling brass shell  casings ejected by aircraft on strafing runs. That led to a May, 1974, incident  in which five young men, hired to collect the casings, died after being  abandoned on the range without provisions.    There is little likelihood of a repeat tragedy: Most of the guns aboard the  F-15, F-16 and A-10 aircraft used today spit the valuable casings into  containers and bring them back.

Last Tuesday  and Wednesday the city of Zahedan witnessed an all-out war.    A group of armed men who were apparently protesting the  destruction of a Sunni mosque in Mashhad began demonstrating  against the regime in a mosque in the center of Zahedan.  JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI's correspondent reports that they tore Islamic  Republic flags and chanted slogans against the leaders of the  Islamic government.    At the same time, revolution guards and policemen, who had  prepared the city for a celebration of the anniversary of  Ayatollah Khomeyni's arrival in Iran, fired on the demonstrators  and received return fire from them.    For about half a day Khayyam Street in the center of the  city  of Zahedan and the surrounding areas became a complete war zone  and the scene of heavy fighting.    Several residents of the city told news correspondents that  the windows of their homes had been broken by bullets.    IRNA gave no further details, but it insisted that the  demonstrators are counterrevolutionaries and that these  incidents mostly take place on the days of the anniversary of  the revolution, and it added: The hezbollah nation resisted the  counterrevolutionaries, and despite the situation that  developed, the ceremonies were held. Figures on the numbers  killed and wounded have not yet been published.    Reliable reports from the province of Khuzestan also tell of  an atmosphere of unrest that is worrisome for the regime. Last  week a group making contact with news agencies and Iranian and  foreign publications reported mass arrests of their friends and  associates. On the other hand, the Islamic Republic Government  published a statement according to which national and army  officials have the direct permission of the president of the  republic to leave the country at any time. The issuance of such  an order by the government, in view of the existing  circumstances in Iran, indicates various kinds of problems.    Based on reports received from Iran, the unrest in Zahedan  began when a report was received from Mashhad that the regime  intended to destroy the Sunni mosque in Mashhad. The protest  against this began initially with a gathering that took  political sanctuary in Zahedan's Maki Mosque, and then it led to  a demonstration where attacks were made against the decorations,  lamps, and placards, which were made to mark the beginning of  the Ten Days of Dawn celebration. In this attack two  revolutionary guardsmen were killed and several of them were  wounded.    According to the newsletter of the expatriate organization  HEZB-E MELLAT-E IRAN, Mowlavi 'Abdolhamid, Friday Imam of  Zahedan, is one of the wounded. His wounds are said to be  ""severe.""    Talks with Mowlavi 'Abdolhamid by the Islamic Republic's  representatives, who had come from Tehran to calm the unrest,  ended with no result.    In the midst of this, 'Ali Khamene'i, commander in chief of  the armed forces, appointed 'Ali Mohammad Basharati to replace  him for three years on the police force so the regime will be  better able to resist uprisings. The Islamic government also  staged a demonstration on its own behalf in Zahedan. In this  demonstration the regime's mercenaries chanted slogans in favor  of the government and against what they called  counterrevolutionaries.     "

Hossein Shahriarifar, 26, however, allegedly implicated two  other Iranians arrested with him in the southern tourist town of  Hat Yai on Friday as taking part in falsifying passports, Pol  Lt-Gen Chaisit said.    Shahriarifar and another Iranian suspect, Mohammadi  Lotfollah, who is still at large, were sought under arrest  warrants issued by the police last week on charges of conspiring  to commit premeditated murder, robbery resulting in the death of  others, and making and possessing explosives. [background  passage omitted] [see item BK0306124894 in previous Terrorism  Report]    Nine witnesses yesterday identified Hossein, detained at the  Metropolitan Police Private School in Bang Khen, as the truck  driver, according to Pol Lt Gen Chaisit.    Shahriarifar and his two Iranian friends, Babak Taheri and  Basr Kazemi, were caught early Friday morning at the Inthra  Hotel in Hat Yai.    A source at an immigration office in Songkhla's Sadao  district said Shahriarifar held a valid passport issued by Iran  under the name Pajiri Mahmed and entered Thailand through the  immigration checkpoint on Thursday.    Since Shahriarifar's photo in the passport allegedly looked  similar to a sketch produced by Lumphini police station and  distributed to immigration offices across the country, an  immigration officer advised Hat Yai police to keep a close watch  on the man who checked-in at the hotel later on Thursday.    The source said Shahriarifar had entered and left Thailand  through the immigration checkpoints in Sadao and Su-ngai Kolok  districts more than 10 times under different names.    The immigration officers, however, earlier could not  identify  him because they did not have his photograph.    Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar, believed to have left  the country after his failure to allegedly bomb the embassy,  came back because he had fallen in love with a Thai woman in Hat  Yai.    The suspect also might have thought that the Thai police had  called off their investigation.    Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar did not implicate the  other suspect as being involved in the embassy bombing plot.    He said the police found the gang had its command centre in  Malaysia where one of its leading members had been caught by  Malaysian police on charges of falsifying documents.    The Metropolitan Police Bureau is looking for additional  witnesses and evidence against Shahriarifar in Bangkok and  southern provinces.    Investigations will be completed in seven days and the  suspect will then be charged in the Criminal Court, Pol Lt-Gen  Chaisit said.    Metropolitan Police Bureau deputy commissioner Sophon  Waratchanon dismissed concern that Shahriarifar might try to  kill himself, saying the suspect did not seem under stress.    Neither the Iranian nor the Israeli embassies have contacted  the police since the arrest of Shahriarifar, he said.    Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said in Cha-am  yesterday that the car-bomb attempt was connected with some  ""Thai people in Bangkok.""    ""I thought there would be a lot more to come. Something  strange would happen,"" Gen. Chawalit said. He did not elaborate.    He said the Interior Ministry had told the Iranian Embassy  that the Thai police were proceeding with the case.     "

The ministry described the seven as mercenaries, and the incident in Villa Clara province as a 'strange attempt of armed infiltration coming from the US'. It occurred a week before Cuban and US delegations were due to meet in Havana to review a bilateral immigration accord signed on September 9.

However, the Panamanian head of state denied Italian reports  that arrests were made in his country in connection with the  ""Unigold"" operation, which on Wednesday destroyed a network that  laundered $100 million monthly from the sale of Colombian  cocaine in the United States through large amounts of gold sent  to Panama.    In statements to EFE, Endara said that according to the  security reports he has received, an international operation was  conducted with the participation of Italian police, and although  Panama ""was not directly involved, it was kept informed of the  situation by other agencies.""    The cooperation, Endara added, was ""at the level of  information,"" which the Italians did not request directly but  received through unidentified organizations.    Endara said he does not believe that these kinds of  drug-related activities affect the international image of  Panama, whose international banking system and Free Trade Zone  have been considered by U.S. counternarcotics experts as ""very  vulnerable"" to money laundering.    ""This happens in all countries, and we always cooperate when  asked,"" the president stressed.    According to reports by authorities, the network dismantled  in Italy was led by Colombian citizen Gustavo Jesus Upegui  Delgado, former accountant of late Medellin Cartel chief Pablo  Escobar and currently one of the main financial leaders of the  ""Cali Cartel."" Upegui has been arrested in Vicenza (northeast  part of the country). Seven Italian businessmen were arrested in  Vicenza and Arezzo on charges of participating in the money  ""laundering"" network.    Reports from Italy said that four other unidentified people  were arrested in Panama, but Endara asserted that no arrests had  been made in his country in connection with the ""Unigold""  operation.    Italian authorities began the investigation last June after  receiving a lead from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA).    According to reports from Italy, the dismantled gang used  ""narcodollars"" to buy some 1,000 kg of gold bars per month,  which were sent to Panama, where they were resold and the  ""laundered"" money wired to the Cali Cartel in Colombia.    Alessandro Pansa, director of the operation and one of the  individuals responsible for the Central Operation Center of  Italy's Criminal Police, said in his country that the  trafficking operations were so large that they threatened to  alter the gold market.    Endara said that unlike other countries, Panama does not  control the sale of gold, which ""comes and goes without a  problem.""    Italian investigators identified three corporations, all  based in Arezzo, as the owners of bank accounts where the  ""narcodollars"" were sent. The corporations are Simar Joyeros  Mayoristas, which has an outlet in Panama, Aurea Trading  International, and Eurocatene.    Panamanian sources at Simar Joyeros Mayoristas told EFE that  their corporation had not participated in any drug money  laundering operation, that no employee had been arrested, and  that last year an investigation conducted by the Panamanian  Customs Directorate cast no doubts on the corporation's  activities.    According to government sources, the jewelry corporation in  Panama is owned by Saul Schwartz, a Jewish businessman who on 1  June was kidnapped under strange circumstances by unidentified  individuals who released him uninjured after an unspecified  ransom was paid through a rabbi.

""They (the aircraft) were warned, they ignored it and they  have paid the price,"" he said.

0,FT921-209 ,"FT921-209 _AN-CC4BOAAQFT 920331   FT  31 MAR 92 / Egypt falls into line on censure of Libya      By TONY WALKER      CAIRO   EGYPTIAN officials, who have led a rearguard action to save Libya from international censure over the 1988 bombing of an American airliner, appeared to have resigned themselves last night to the passage of UN sanctions. Officials were last night signalling that Cairo would reluctantly fall into line with some of the sanctions provisions, such as an arms and air embargo, but they were vague as to whether Egypt would also downgrade diplomatic links with Libya as required by the proposed Security Council resolution. 'My understanding is that we will comply with the resolution,' said a well-placed official. 'Egypt supports international legality and the role of the United Nations.' However, there is no doubt that western determination to press ahead with sanctions in an effort to force Libya to yield two of its nationals accused of bombing Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie is causing acute discomfort in Egypt whose diplomacy has, for the past six months, been fully engaged in efforts to head off just such a development. Egyptian uneasiness, and indeed misgivings among the pro-western Arabs generally, stems from a fear that western pressure against Libya will be portrayed throughout the region as another example of the west seeking to bully a weak Arab state under the so-called 'New World Order', weighted heavily towards US interests. 'To Arabs, it appears like the strong imposing its will on the weak under a new Pax Americana,' said Professor Saad Ibrahim of the American University in Cairo. 'People are unhappy about the precedent that is being established and ask where will it end, not that anyone has much sympathy for Gadaffi himself.' One western official believes that one of the main problems in what he described as a 'messy situation' stems from Arab misunderstandings of what is involved in the due process of law in the west. 'No matter how hard we try to explain the situation, reactions are emotional,' he observed. 'People believe what they they want to believe.' Mr Gamil Mattar, a former senior Arab League official, voiced a common view among Arab intellectuals when he said there was 'no precedent' for demands to extradite the Libyan nationals. 'What's the point of delivering these two people to the US?' he asked. 'This kind of humiliation of the Arabs will only lead to more violence and terrorism.' Arab commentators are suggesting the west may be in danger of painting itself into a corner over the issue of sanctions. Dr Gehad Auda of the Centre for Political and International Development Studies in Cairo said that just as the Arabs faced a dilemma over Libya, so did the west. 'What can the US do to oblige Libya to comply?' he asked. 'It cannot use force. In fact, the US does not know what to do to uphold the norms of the new international order.' Egyptian officials say they are hoping for a last-minute compromise before the sanctions package is due to come into effect on April 15. They are pinning hopes on the International Court of Justice, which has been asked by Libya to rule on who might have jurisdiction in the case. But they hold out little hope of a quick resolution.

Attending the meeting were the defense minister, interior  minister, the public prosecutor, the legal investigator into the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church bombing, the commanders of the security  agencies, and the envoy of the Syrian security and intelligence  department operating in Lebanon. During the meeting, the  conferees reviewed the security situation in the country, the  results of security investigations, and the accompanying sweeps  and detentions. The meeting addressed the following topics:    1. The meeting reviewed the results of the investigations by  the security agencies of the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat  Church and the ensuing sweeps and detentions that targeted  suspects and other defendants in bombings, according to legal  arrest warrants. These sweeps covered most Lebanese areas and  camps without discrimination from Sidon to 'Akkar. The sweeps,  which were carried out by all Lebanese security agencies and  occasionally backed by units of the Syrian Arab forces, resulted  in the arrest of 127 people.    2. The conferees stressed the Lebanese people's right to  resist the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon and western  al-Biqa', noting the importance of the resistance's heroic acts  that undermined the Israeli enemy army and its agents in the  border strip. The conferees then discussed the ramifications of  the appearance of gunmen in Ba'labakk on Friday [11 March],  which is considered to be a flagrant violation of the law. They  also reviewed the measures taken by the military public  prosecution office against those who broke the law, particularly  since the negative effects of these violations overshadowed the  measures of the security agencies tasked with investigating the  bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church.    3. His Excellency the prime minister stressed the need for  the security agencies to continue their interrogations and  security measures until the networks of terrorism and sabotage,  which threaten the country's security, are uncovered,  particularly since the Lebanese judiciary supervises all these  measures. Al-Hariri pointed out that the general amnesty law  pardons former criminals but does not prevent the security  agencies from investigating previous or subsequent crimes to  preserve the country's security. The public attorney said that  the general amnesty law was based on the principle that amnesty  can be rescinded if a person commits new crimes similar to  previous ones. Accordingly, all these criminals remain under  watch and can be hunted down for all crimes, including the  pardoned ones. At the end of the meeting, al-Hariri expressed  his satisfaction with the work of the security agencies and  urged them to continue their work and be strict in their  interrogations and measures against all violators and criminals,  no matter to which party they belong.

""There are three more attacks to come,"" Hamas said in a  communique sent to AFP in Gaza City.    On April 7, a suicide bomber blew up a bus at 'Afula killing  seven Israelis and wounding 45 in the first attack to avenge the  mosque massacre of 30 Muslims by a Jewish settler in Hebron on  February 25.    Hamas said it was proud to claim responsibility in the name  of its armed branch 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam for Wednesday's attack  at Hadera that left five dead apart from the bomber and 30  wounded.    ""The enemy prime minister (Yitzhaq) Rabin and his  chief-of-staff Ehud Baraq can expect three more surprises to  make them control the settlers,"" Hamas announced.    ""The Hadera attack is another victory for 'Izz al-Din  al-Qassam's intelligence and security network,"" it boasted. ""Our  hero got through all of Israel's security checks.""    Israel ""totally"" sealed off the occupied territories after  the 'Afula bombing in a bid to halt more killings and announced  that security had been stepped up for Wednesday's memorial day  for fallen soldiers and independence day on Thursday.    Hamas warned Arabs living in Israel to keep away from public  places where Jews gathered. ""We advise them not to get on  Israeli buses.""    The communique also criticized PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat  for  voicing regret at the murders. ""'Izz al-Din al-Qassam swears by  God and the gun to defend our national rights.""    [In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0904 GMT on 14  April adds the following: ""The young Hamas militant who died  carrying out the Hadera bus bombing had been arrested several  times for clashes with Israeli troops, residents of his home  village said Thursday.    [""They named the bomber as 22-year-old 'Amr Salih 'Amarnah  and said he was from the occupied West Bank village of Ya'bad,  east of Hadera where a bomb on a bus Wednesday killed five  Israelis and wounded 30.    [""Israeli troops had arrested 'Amarnah several times,  villagers told AFP.    [""Police said the assailant in the Hadera bombing, which  coincided with Israel's memorial day for its soldiers who have  fallen in battle, came from the West Bank but did not name him.    [""They said he had also placed a second bomb in the Hadera  central bus station, timed to explode 90 minutes after the first  blast and at a time when Israelis observed a minute of silence  for their fallen soldiers.    [""Explosives experts blew up the second bomb.""]    [In another related report, Paris AFP in English at 0915 GMT  on 14 April adds the following: ""Hamas spokesman Ibrahim  Ghawshah, in an interview published Thursday, said the group was  ready to halt deadly attacks on civilians inside the Jewish  state if Israelis stopped `killing our children.'    [""`The principle of reciprocity is the same everywhere,' he  told the London-based Arabic newspaper AL-HAYAH.    [""`When Rabin stops killing our children and our women,  Hamas  will stop attacking civilians and it will target only troops and  settlers,' the spokesman said.    [""`The shabab (youths) of the intifadah will do miracles and  will prove that the Israeli army is a paper tiger,' Ghawshah  warned.    [""He also blasted 'Arafat for expressing regrets. `The blood  of Palestinian children and women is not cheaper than the blood  of Israeli civilians,' he said.""]     "

Just hours after the victims were buried several Christian  political leaders turned on the government, demanding that it  fulfil its responsibilities by identifying and punishing the  bombers.    Many agreed the government was wrong to focus its attention  on ambitious projects to rebuild Lebanon's war-shattered  infrastructure when it should first strengthen security and  address social issues.    The head of the Maronite Church, Monsignor Nasrallah Sfayr,  set the tone at a funeral service Monday in Our Lady of  Deliverance Church, where 55 worshippers were also wounded  during Lent Mass on Sunday.    ""All the Lebanese have the right to a life of freedom  without  fear, frustration and inequality,"" Sfayr said, urging the  government to rectify its mistakes.    ""Saying that such things happen in other countries is not  enough for us. Elsewhere the culprits are found and punished,  but here they are not identified because of negligence or  incompetence,"" he added.    Karim Paqraduni, Secretary General of the right-wing  Christian Phalange Party, echoed Sfayr, speaking to AFP on  Tuesday.    ""There is no political will to arrest those responsible for  this revolting crime,"" he said.    Paqraduni escaped a December bomb attack on his party's  headquarters during a weekly leadership meeting because he was  abroad at the time. Three people were killed and 100 wounded,  and the bomber is still at large.    The church bomb ""played into the hands of extremists on all  sides,"" Paqraduni said.    ""The bomb clearly underlined a political desire to  destabilise the situation in Lebanon, terrorise Christians and  push them to react, in a bid to create a civil war situation in  Lebanon,"" Paqraduni said.    ""The government's political inefficiency allowed this to  happen,"" he added.    For 'Isa Ghurayb, chief editor of the French-language  L'ORIENT-LE JOUR, the ""horror"" which plagued Lebanon during its  1975-1990 civil war had returned to haunt the Lebanese.    Ghurayb, whose newspaper is owned by Culture Minister Michel  Iddih, said the church bombing was the latest in a series of  unpunished attacks against Christian targets in Lebanon.    ""These repeated acts of aggression worry the Christians,  mainly the Maronites, because they coincide with an  unprecedented political imbalance in Lebanon ... (where) a  growing number of Christian feel they have become alienated.    ""Nothing is being done to remedy this disastrous feeling.  There are just hollow calls to close ranks around the  government,"" he said.    Samir Ja'ja', head of the former Christian Lebanese Forces  militia, accused the government of failing the Lebanese people,  who ""have realised that the security the authorities promised to  restore is still a mirage.""    The sense of frustration arose after the 1989 al-Ta'if  inter-parliamentary accord, which effectively ended the war in  Lebanon, with the Christians agreeing to give Muslims a greater  share in running the country.    It was exacerbated as the government failed to keep a pledge  to introduce sweeping social and economic reforms, which led  most Christians to boycott the 1992 legislative elections,  protesting that they were imposed by Syria.    No demographic survey has been carried out in Lebanon since  1932, but the Christians maintain they represent 50 percent of  the three-million-strong population, even though hundreds of  thousands fled the country during the war.    The Muslims say they outnumber the Christians by two to one,  but the Maronites are the largest single Christian community.     "

By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER      CARTAGENA, Colombia      Last fall, as a wave of narco-terrorism swept Colombia, this historic city of  Spanish colonial stonework and sunny Caribbean beaches vanished from the  international tourist map. The seasonal tide of American and Canadian travelers  never came in, and Cartagena's main business withered in despair.    Adalberto Jimenez, an English-speaking tourist guide, said recently that  without foreign customers, he is having a hard time feeding his 11 children.    ""They aren't getting enough to eat. They aren't getting nutritious food,"" said  Jimenez, 58.    ""Right now we are in a complete recession,"" said Jim Buttgen, a Cartagena tour  operator who specialized in catering to American cruise ship passengers. But  Buttgen and other Cartagena businessmen are hoping that this week's visit by  President Bush will help restore the interrupted flow of North American  visitors and revive the local economy.    According to Buttgen's optimistic scenario, international publicity for Bush's  anti-drug summit here with three South American presidents on Thursday will  focus favorable attention on a peaceful and beautiful Cartagena.    ""It's the best thing that ever happened to Cartagena,"" Buttgen said over lunch  in a nearly empty restaurant. ""We're going to get free advertising all over the  world, and if things go well afterward, we'll just have to do a good  follow-up.""    Buttgen and others here assume that Cartagena will prove a safe place for the  summit. Until a dynamite bomb exploded on the sixth floor of the Hotel  Cartagena Hilton late in September, the city seemed immune from the  narco-terrorism and other violence that has plagued Colombia for years.    Cocaine traffickers were known to have invested heavily in apartment buildings  in Bocagrande, a narrow peninsula on the east side of Cartagena that went  high-rise in the 1980s. The city was believed to be a favored playground for  the drug lords and off-limits for trafficking and killings.    Founded in 1533, Cartagena de Indias once was the busiest port on the Spanish  Main, serving as a transshipment point for goods from Spain and gold from South  America. It was repeatedly attacked by buccaneers, including Francis Drake and  John Hawkins.    Central Cartagena is still a walled citadel flanked by monumental stone forts.  Inside the walls, colonial buildings with carved stone doorways and wooden  balconies line the narrow streets and picturesque plazas. In nearby Bocagrande,  the Hilton and other tourist hotels rise a few steps away from sandy beaches  and the gentle waves of the Caribbean.    A year ago, Cartagena was enjoying a tourist boom despite violence elsewhere in  Colombia. Canadians flocked in on charter jets, Americans poured off Caribbean  cruise ships and increasing numbers of Europeans were coming by scheduled  airline flights.    For the 1989-1990 tourist season, which was to begin last September, the city  had expected 45,000 tourists on charter planes from Canada and at least that  many cruise ship passengers.    In late August, after drug lords declared all-out war on Colombia's leaders  land launched a terrorist bombing campaign, the U.S. State Department issued an  advisory that included Cartagena for the first time in a ""status orange""  designation previously applied to other Colombian cities. ""Travel only when  essential and with rigorous precautions,"" the advisory warned.    Caribbean cruise lines canceled all calls here. And when Canada's Foreign  Ministry followed with a similar advisory in September, Canadian charter  companies halted all Cartagena flights.    The bomb at the Hilton exploded Sept. 25, killing two Colombian doctors who  were attending a Latin American medical convention here. The blast demolished  10 rooms in the hotel and shattered Cartagena's image of immunity from  narco-terrorism.    Suddenly, ""the city was dead, dead -- you didn't see anyone,"" said Claudia  Fadul, manager of the municipal agency for promoting tourism. ""The saddest  thing is that it was the Hilton. Had it been another hotel, it wouldn't have  had such international impact.""    Minutes after the explosion at the Hilton, another bomb damaged the office of a  government bank in another part of the city, injuring a watchman. A month  later, a car bomb exploded in Bocagrande, injuring two people. And in early  November, a bomb damaged a shopping center on the south side of the city but  caused no injuries.    Since then, Cartagena has suffered no such terrorist attacks. The city has  hosted a Miss Colombia beauty pageant, a conference of Colombian mayors and a  heavy influx of holiday vacationers from other parts of Colombia, all without  incident.    In mid-January, Colombian cocaine traffickers called a truce in their war, and  terrorist bombings stopped throughout the country. But Colombian marines have  continued to operate a checkpoint on the only street entering Bocagrande, and  police posted at tourist hotels search the baggage of all arriving guests.    Hoteliers apologize for the precaution, emphasizing that the Hilton bombing was  an isolated incident. Jorge Serna, manager of the Hilton, observed that  Cartagena has less crime and terrorism than some European cities.    ""It's basically a safe place,"" he said. ""We feel very picked upon when they put  out a warning. Is there a warning to go to Spain? There's no warning for Spain.  Is there a warning to go to England? There isn't. And there is bombing going on  over there.""    A Colombian television commentator said recently that Colombian President  Virgilio Barco Vargas will ask President Bush to lift the State Department  warning for Cartagena when they meet at the summit here.    ""President Bush has to see that this place is as safe as many places in  Europe,"" Serna said, adding that television viewers around the world will get  the same impression.    According to a senior White House official in Washington, the U.S. Secret  Service has considered the possibility that drug traffickers might try to  attack Bush at Thursday's summit with shoulder-fired missiles. But a  communique, purportedly signed by fugitive drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, denied  that the traffickers had targeted Bush or possessed SAM-7 missiles to use  against Air Force One.    Bush is scheduled to stay only a few hours, and his visit is expected to be  confined to the area of a well-protected Colombian naval base outside the city.

A CSCE statement published here urged Belgrade to permit it  to carry out ""long-term"" missions, banned by rump Yugoslavia  last year.    The CSCE mentioned arbitrary arrests and detentions, police  brutality and attempts to create ethnically cleansed zones in  the rump federation of Serbia and Montenegro.    In July, Belgrade banned long-term CSCE missions to Sandzak,  the majority Albanian province Kosovo and the province of  Vojvodina, where there is a substantial population of ethnic  Hungarians.    The missions' aim was to check minority rights were being  respected and help prevent an extension of the war in  ex-Yugoslavia.     "

The provocative aerial espionage was part of their  premeditated war preparations against the DPRK.    Meanwhile, overseas-based pursuit-assault planes, VTOL  [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes and early warning  planes held a surprise bombing exercise in the skies above  Yongwol, Pyongchang and Asan Bay in cooperation with scores of  warplanes belonging to the U.S. Air Force present in South Korea.

Gen. Carl W. Stiner led the U.S. invasion of Panama last week, few  among his admirers and critics were surprised.    The three-star Army general may be a slow-talking country boy from eastern  Tennessee, but he has been in the center of many high-risk military actions in  recent years, including the dramatic capture of the hijackers of the cruise  ship Achille Lauro in 1985.    ""They couldn't have found a better guy to do it,"" said retired Gen. Edward C.  Meyer, former Army chief of staff.    ""He's got direct experience in special operations, airborne, mechanized  infantry. He served in Lebanon. He's the right guy for this kind of intermixing  of special operations and conventional forces,"" Meyer said of Stiner, who is  base commander of Ft. Bragg, N.C.    ""He comes across like Jimmy Stewart,"" another retired general added. ""Stiner  doesn't get real excited. He has a lot of patience.""    Such unflappability served Stiner well on Oct. 10, 1985, at the Sigonella Air  Base in Sicily, moments after U.S. Navy F-14 fighter jets had forced down an  EgyptAir plane carrying several of Achille Lauro's hijackers. As commander of  the operation, Stiner flew aboard one of the Navy jets.    Once on the ground, amid great tension and confusion over custody of the  hijackers, a squabble between Italian and American soldiers quickly escalated  into a near-brawl.    ""There was a sizable group and there were pretty good fisticuffs going on,""  recalled one knowledgeable military source. ""But Stiner was able to calm the  situation and bring it under control.""    However, the same source who praised Stiner's handling of that incident also  added:    ""He's not particularly bright. He's gone a long way without a lot of  equipment,"" the source said. He charged that Stiner's lack of appreciation for  the complexities of Middle East politics may have been a factor in the heavy  loss of life in the suicide bombing of the Marine headquarters in Beirut in  1983. The terrorist attack killed 241 U.S. servicemen.    During his brief stint there as the representative of the chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, Stiner in late 1983 recommended that the battleship New Jersey  open fire on Muslim militias -- even though, his critics have noted, no  Americans were in immediate danger.    The subsequent U.S. shelling of Muslim areas destroyed American credibility and  neutrality in Lebanon. Just over a month later, a suicide bomber in an  explosives-laden truck leveled the Marines headquarters.    However, former National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane said that blaming  Stiner for the bombing is ""a bum rap.""    ""It's true that he reported that the Marines were vulnerable and (recommended)  that they be reinforced by gunfire,"" said McFarlane, then the presidential  trouble-shooter on the scene. But the final decision to shell the militias was  made by President Ronald Reagan, McFarlane noted in an interview.    He and others described Stiner as an officer with uncommon concern for his  troops -- to the point of advising young soldiers on family planning and  budgeting. ""The guy's very conscious of the relationship between stability at  home and performance on the field,"" McFarlane said.    Stiner was born in LaFollette, Tenn. He has a bachelor's degree in agriculture  from Tennessee Polytechnical Institute and a master's degree in public  administration from Shippensburg State College, Pa.

VALLEY GANG SWEEPS;    CRIME: POLICE CALL IT MOST SUCCESSFUL OPERATION EVER. BUT VIOLENCE PLAGUES  SOUTHLAND AS AT LEAST 15 PEOPLE ARE REPORTED SLAIN.      By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER      In the most extensive crackdown ever on gangs operating in the San Fernando  Valley, police during the weekend arrested 618 people -- including 270 alleged  gang members -- for crimes ranging from possession of narcotics to unpaid  parking tickets.    About 200 Los Angeles police officers were assigned to the anti-gang task force  ""Operation Hammer,"" which from Friday night until Sunday swept through known  gang hangouts. About 14 pounds of illegal drugs were confiscated, along with 51  vehicles, officers said. The sweep came in response to citizens' complaints  about growing gang problems, police said.    ""The public is complaining all the time about gang members hanging out in front  of liquor stores and apartments, selling narcotics and scaring people that are  walking by,"" Sgt. Frank Stilo said.    Recent police crime statistics show that gang-related crimes in the Valley  during 1989 more than doubled from the previous year, from 510 to 1,191.    Last July, in what had been the largest Valley gang sweep, police arrested 267  people, including 94 suspected gang members. Police said the latest Valley  sweep, their most successful ever, netted 115 felony arrests and 503  misdemeanor arrests. Forty-one people were booked on suspicion of driving under  the influence of alcohol or drugs and 48 were arrested for investigation of  possessing narcotics.    ""The sweep, in my opinion, appears to have been very successful,"" Stilo said.    Meanwhile, violence plagued other parts of the Southland, as at least 15 people  were reported slain during the weekend, including a young woman allegedly  gunned down by her stepfather in Santa Ana.    The woman, Olivia Bohaman, 21, and a younger sister were found wounded in the  living room of their house Saturday afternoon, Santa Ana police said. Bohaman  died of head wounds and the sister was treated for wounds to her arms and back.    Police said they were seeking Jose Lopez Perez, 32, the estranged husband of  the victims' mother, who was seen driving away from the house.    Elsewhere, two men were shot at a hamburger stand near MacArthur Park about 5  a.m. Sunday, Los Angeles police said. One died and the other was hospitalized  in serious condition. The victims were shot by a man who got out of a car,  walked up to them and fired, police said.    An unidentified man was found shot to death in his La Puente home at 12:15 a.m.  Sunday, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. In South Los Angeles, an  unidentified man was stabbed to death early Sunday, police said.    On Saturday, an unidentified 22-year-old man was shot and killed in South Los  Angeles and another unidentified man was shot to death in southwest Los  Angeles, police said. An unidentified man was shot as he stood on the sidewalk  in the Los Feliz area early Saturday morning, police said.    A 15-year-old boy was shot to death in an unincorporated area near Whittier  just before 1 a.m. Saturday. And a second 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death  later in Pico Rivera. Sheriff's deputies said both crimes appeared to be gang  related.    In Hacienda Heights, Joseph Sanchez, 21, was shot to death Saturday in his  garage, sheriff's deputies said. Witnesses said they saw two men leaving the  scene on foot, but no arrests were made, officers said.    Police reported five more deaths Friday night.

The government then submitted its  written statement after removing the part ""Speaking from a  purely legal point of view... one cannot say that it is a  violation.""    What should we make of this? ASAHI SHIMBUN's 7 June  editorial called the government's position ""heartless.""  MAINICHI SHIMBUN's 8 June editorial criticized the Foreign  Ministry: ""One can only call the response that of legal  gangsters."" Certainly, one can understand how the written  statement that ""one cannot say that the use of nuclear weapons  is a violation"" does not square with the popular sentiment of  Japanese who, having experienced the bombing of Hiroshima and  Nagasaki, have since taken the lead in implementing the three  nonnuclear principles, and appealed to the world for disarmament  and the abolition of nuclear weapons. The immediate reaction of  the people in this way, too, can certainly be considered a sound  response. However, the nature of the nuclear problem is a  complicated one. The people did not react after understanding  the big picture and giving it dispassionate and mature  consideration. Explaining the problem rationally to the people  should remain the task of specialists and political leaders. Of  course, diplomacy divorced from popular sentiment will not last.  But it is also true that diplomacy errs in simply following  popular sentiment.    The editorials from ASAHI SHIMBUN and MAINICHI SHIMBUN  themselves admit that ""perhaps there is no treaty or agreement  in which it is expressly written that the use of nuclear weapons  is a legal violation"" (ASAHI), and that ""the fact is that there  is almost certainly no international law or regulation  prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons"" (MAINICHI). Therefore,  the argument becomes one for enacting a law: ""If nonuse of  nuclear weapons is not prescribed by international law, then it  should be prescribed in accord with the times"" (ASAHI). The  problem the ICJ raised is an argument of interpretation.  Therefore, ASAHI and MAINICHI have substituted the first type  of argument for the second. If they had answered the problem  squarely, ASAHI and MAINICHI would have had to say that, ""One  cannot say that the use of nuclear weapons is against the law.""  However, those taking the position that depends on the argument  for enacting a law so that ""the use of nuclear weapons is  against the law"" probably also wished to say ""it is against the  law"" in the argument of interpretation as well. However, that  is like the 17th-century Roman Catholic pope who demanded that  Galileo accept the Ptolemaic theory that the sun revolves around  the earth. Perhaps the Foreign Ministry officials are murmuring,  ""Even so, it is the earth that is revolving around the sun.""    Hiroshima, Nagasaki Bombings Were Violations of  International Law    Of course, saying ""one cannot say it is against the law""  does  not mean that one can therefore legally use nuclear weapons at  any time and any place. In a war of aggression, the war itself  is against the law, and thus so not only are nuclear weapons but  the use of all weapons. The problem is that even for cases in  which a war is legal (for example, in exercising the right to  self-defense or in the military measures taken by the United  Nations), the use of certain weapons is outlawed. The question  is whether nuclear weapons are among them. In the balance  between military effectiveness and humanitarian considerations,  the call to prohibit the use of certain weapons comes when the  latter consideration dominates (i.e., when suffering considered  unnecessary is inflicted by the use of certain weapons despite  there being other means to achieve the same military effect).  Thus, the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 outlawed the use  of explosives under 400 grams while not outlawing the use of  those above 400 grams. Even if we were to ignore military  effectiveness and outlaw the use of certain weapons on the  grounds of humanitarianism alone, the act would actually have no  effect. All weapons are basically inhumane. Speaking from a  strictly humane point of view, the use of all weapons should be  prohibited.    Incidentally, I believe the atomic bombing of Hiroshima  and Nagasaki by the United States was illegal under  international law. However, my reasoning is not that the use of  the atomic bombs was itself illegal (dropping an atomic bomb on  the battleship Yamato under way at sea would have been  completely legal) but that the act strayed from the principle of  military targeting. The bombing was illegal as an  indiscriminate attack upon a defenseless city, resulting in many  casualties among peaceful citizens. In that sense, although  atomic bombs were not used, the massive air raid against Tokyo  on 10 March 1945 was an eminent violation of international law.    Inescapable Problem of Nuclear Deterrence    However, the destructive and killing power of nuclear  weapons  is tremendous. A situation in which they would be used again is  absolutely inexcusable for whatever reason. Turning at this  point to the argument for enacting a law, it is natural for  Japan, which maintains its three nonnuclear principles, to work  to outlaw the use of nuclear weapons. However, precisely  because we would not resolve all the issues in creating such a  treaty, the problem is truly complicated. To what extent do  Japanese understand this? The history of international  relations is one of broken treaties. The real issue is creating  an international management system to guarantee the  implementation of the agreements. Then, for that to happen, we  cannot escape from the problem of nuclear deterrence. Therein  lies the true difficulty of this problem.     "

Mr Sidki, 63, was unscathed. Jihad, an extremist Islamic group, immediately claimed responsibility. The bombing was to 'avenge the blood of the martyrs', a reference to Jihad members killed by security forces or sentenced to death in recent trials. The attack is the third failed assassination attempt on an Egyptian minister in eight months. Mr Safwat al-Sherif, information minister, survived a shooting near his home in April, while Mr Hassan al-Alfi, interior minister, was injured when a bomb exploded near his motorcade in central Cairo in mid-August, an attack also claimed by Jihad. Mr Sidki, on TV a few hours after the attack, warned the government would toughen its clampdown on Islamic extremists.   Countries:-  EGZ  Egypt, Africa.

DEPUTIES SAY ONE MAN WAS A MAJOR DEALER IN THE VALLEY.      By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Sheriff's narcotics investigators pursuing the trail of marijuana grown in  sophisticated underground farms in the Antelope Valley and Arizona have  arrested a San Fernando Valley drug distributor linked to the network,  authorities said Monday.    Michael Kumar, 31, allegedly sold more than $1 million worth of marijuana a  year supplied by the operators of the Antelope Valley and Arizona farms, 14 of  whom were indicted by a federal grand jury in Phoenix last week, Deputy Dist.  Atty. Stephen L. Cooley said.    Kumar, who will be charged today by county prosecutors with conspiracy to sell  marijuana and possession of marijuana for sale, was arrested Friday night at a  Castaic motel after attempting to buy 30 pounds of marijuana in a fake drug  deal set up by investigators, authorities said.    Sheriff's investigators have ""taken a major dealer off the street,"" Cooley  said. ""He appeared to be operating in the seven figures on an annual basis.""    Deputies also arrested Gabriel Alfred, 29, of South Los Angeles and Elizabeth  Haskell, 26, who was described as Kumar's girlfriend. Alfred and Haskell will  be charged with conspiracy to sell marijuana, Cooley said.    All three were being held at the Antelope Valley sheriff's station on $1  million bail each, with arraignments expected today. No lawyers could be  reached for comment.    The arrests bring to 19 the number of people named in a continuing  investigation into the high-tech farms and their alleged operators, a group of  construction contractors investigators say produced millions of dollars worth  of marijuana sold in California and other states. Sheriff's deputies identified  Kumar last week as a high-volume distributor, placed him under surveillance and  set up the phony sale, said Capt. Larry Waldie, commander of the sheriff's  narcotics bureau.    ""We arranged the sale of 30 pounds through an informant,"" Waldie said.    Although Kumar was apprehensive because of the well-publicized series of raids  and arrests over the past month, he agreed to buy the marijuana for $105,000 at  the Castaic motel, authorities said. He was arrested about 6 p.m. by deputies,  who then arrested Alfred and Haskell at a nearby restaurant and found the money  in a bag in Alfred's car, Waldie said. Alfred was going to deliver the money to  Kumar to make the payment when the deal was concluded, Waldie said.    Kumar appears to have sold marijuana to lower-level dealers in the San Fernando  Valley, and investigators are trying to determine whether he also operated  elsewhere, Cooley said.    Authorities gave few details on how Kumar was supplied by the desert farms  allegedly financed and overseen by Lancaster contractor Frank Gegax, who  pleaded not guilty Friday to federal charges of possession of and conspiracy to  distribute marijuana.    Kumar may have dealt with the Gegax network through an intermediary, Cooley  said.    ""He and Gegax may not have known each other,"" Cooley said.    Deputies confiscated two vintage 1950s Cadillacs at Kumar's Woodland Hills  house and found about $50,000 worth of marijuana in one of the cars,  authorities said. Prosecutors plan to initiate proceedings to confiscate the  cars and the house, worth $200,000 to $400,000, Cooley said.    In addition to the federal indictments against 14 men and the expected local  charges against Kumar and his two alleged accomplices, two contractors have  been charged in San Bernardino County in connection with a suspected indoor  farm under construction near Barstow.    Federal and local authorities are continuing the investigation, which so far  has turned up four high-tech farms, two more alleged farms under construction  and $77 million worth of marijuana plants.

0,FT922-13041 ,"FT922-13041 _AN-CDNA2AECFT 920414   FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Experts warn cities to prepare for further attacks      By NEIL BUCKLEY   TERRORISM experts yesterday warned London and other cities to brace themselves for further IRA attacks, but said it was impossible to predict the precise tactics the terrorists might use. The explosions in the City and at Staples Corner in north London on Friday were the first IRA car bombs on the mainland since the Harrods bombing in 1983. Some experts had suggested that this attack could mark a return to the use of imprecisely aimed large bombs rather than the smaller devices and firebombs used on the transport system and in shops. But Mr Ian Geldard, editor of Conflict International, a journal which monitors international terrorism, said: 'I do think we are going to see more actions, but it is impossible to predict what tactics they may use and where.' The City, with its narrow streets, tall buildings - which tend to magnify the effect of explosions - and large areas of unsecured glass, has been shown to be a particularly vulnerable target. Mr Geldard, however, said this did not necessarily mean it would suffer repeat attacks. 'The IRA is constantly changing its strategy and tactics. They have moved from targeting military bases to letter bombs, mortar bombs, and smaller devices aimed at transport, and now they've reverted to car bombs. They try to keep everyone guessing.' Experts believe the primary aim of Friday's bomb was to cause widespread damage and disruption, and that the large number of civilian casualties may have been the result of a miscalculation by the IRA, which was not expecting so many people still to be in the City in the evening. 'If they had really wanted to to cause massive civilian casualties they could have timed the bomb to go off at lunchtime,' said one specialist. The timing of the Staples Corner explosion lent weight to the theory that causing damage rather than casualties was the main objective. In the short term, Mr Owen Kelly, commissioner of the City of London police, said yesterday that he would increase the number of officers on hecks of vehicles and people. In the longer term, experts conceded little could be done to make a large area safe against car or parcel-type bombs without intruding into privacy. Moreover, if such intrusion became commonplace, the terrorists could be said to have succeeded in their aim of causing disruption. Mr David Fletcher, chief executive of the British Security Industry Association, suggested that City companies could set up a network of video cameras constantly recording movements in surrounding streets. Many banks and building societies already monitor their premises with closed-circuit television and other companies might be persuaded to follow suit to produce near City-wide cover. Mr Fletcher said the threat of being caught was one of the few effective deterrents to terrorists. 'If someone sees a camera and knows he might be recorded doing what he is doing, then he might decide not to do it.' Friday's bombing also highlighted how badly prepared the City was for such an attack.  The Financial Times   London Page 11  "

The new equipment - devised on government orders after the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am aircraft over Scotland - uses computerised X-ray machinery to analyse materials and match them to profiles of explosives, says BAA. A suspect bag will be examined by sensors that detect explosives' vapours. BAA says the equipment can check up to 20 bags a minute and will not prolong existing check-in procedures. The system will be positioned in the baggage-sorting area, to examine luggage after it has been checked in. The system has been on trial at Glasgow airport and will initially be installed at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports to check international transit baggage.

The figures were released two weeks after Customs announced its latest anti-drug co-operation agreement with the Cruising Association, signed at the London International Boat Show.

0,FT922-1334 ,"FT922-1334 _AN-CFWA9AEFFT 920623   FT  23 JUN 92 / Arrests in Exxon kidnap case fail to clear mystery      By ALAN FRIEDMAN      NEW YORK   THE mystery over the abduction of Mr Sidney Reso, president of Exxon's international division, has deepened, despite the arrest last week of a former Exxon security guard and his wife in connection with the case. A team of more than 30 federal, state and local law enforcement officials followed a trail across the US before charging the couple with the April 29 kidnapping. Yet police still do not know where Mr Reso is or whether he is alive. The FBI is searching for a third suspect, on the assumption that at least one other person is holding Mr Reso. Some light has been shed on the case by court documents filed in connection with the arrests in New Jersey early last Friday morning of Mr Arthur Seale and his wife Irene. The couple were refused bail during a hearing in a Newark, New Jersey, court yesterday. Mr Seale, 45, worked on security matters for Exxon until 1987, having served previously as a policeman in a New Jersey town. The court documents say Exxon received the first ransom demand from the Seales within a day of Mr Reso's disappearance, when his car was found abandoned at the bottom of the driveway to his New Jersey home. The kidnappers then requested that Exxon set up a cellular telephone so that future messages could be phoned in. A series of calls and letters continued to arrive in recent weeks, with one call two weeks ago from a Georgia telephone about 30 miles from Hilton Head, South Carolina, where the Seales had owned a yacht. Police following the trail of the Seales went as far as Vail, Colorado, where the Seales lived for a time after Mr Seale resigned from Exxon. Last Tuesday, as Mr Reso's wife Patricia made a televised appeal for the return of her husband, the Seales allegedly used a tape recorded message, phoned in from a New Jersey phone box, to alert the authorities to a ransom letter that would be delivered to a local sheriff's office. The letter demanded millions of dollars of ransom, to be paid in used Dollars 100 bills and placed in laundry bags. By Thursday evening, after FBI agents had placed the Seales under surveillance, more phone calls gave instructions for the ransom. Nearly an hour after midnight on Friday, the Seales were arrested when they returned an Oldsmobile sedan to a car hire agency in New Jersey. The police who arrested the couple found a 1985 directory of the home addresses of Exxon executives, along with rubber gloves and laundry bags. The arrests mark the first break in the long-running case, but the FBI says the Seales, although questioned at the weekend, have refused to speak about Mr Reso's whereabouts. The FBI has meanwhile confirmed that the Seales are the same people who sent a note in early May claiming to be members of an ecological extremist group called the Rainbow Warriors. But they doubt that the Seales have any ecological affiliation. The Exxon case, according to Mr Joe Rosetti of Kroll Associates, private investigators, 'looks like a classic, almost textbook, kidnapping of the kind you normally see in South America'. Exxon is declining to comment.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Santa Monica voters have not yet had the chance to decide whether they want to  make the city attorney an elected position, but a residents group behind the  ballot measure has begun advertising for candidates.    Santa Monicans for the Citizens Protection Act, the group that through an  initiative drive placed the question of an elected city attorney on the Nov. 6  city ballot, ran a quarter-page ad last week in the Los Angeles Daily Journal,  a legal newspaper.    In the corner of the ad, which cost the group $495, is a picture of the goddess  of justice, with ""City Attorney, City of Santa Monica"" in bold letters.    The ad says candidates must be registered Santa Monica voters at the time of  nomination, November, 1990, for an election in February, 1991.    In a box, the ad emphasizes that ""the candidate should have a personal and  professional commitment to upholding and obeying all laws of the land and must  not have prior criminal record.""    The ad calls for candidates to send resumes and a photo to the campaign  headquarters of Santa Monicans for the Citizens Protection Act.    Supporters of the measure, listed as Proposition Y on the ballot, are  attempting to oust City Atty. Robert M. Myers because of his policy not to  prosecute homeless people for such misdemeanors as sleeping in parks and public  inebriation. They have also made an issue of the several times that Myers was  arrested in connection with his participation in protests against nuclear  testing.    They say Myers' tolerant attitude toward the homeless is to blame for a growing  homeless population in the city and aggressive panhandling and attacks by some  transients.    Leslie Dutton, an organizing member of the group, was one of three people  filing a complaint against Myers last week with the State Bar of California,  the regulating agency for attorneys.    The complaint charges Myers with violating the State Bar's Act and Rules of  Professional Conduct for not prosecuting those certain misdemeanors and claims  that his misdemeanor arrests for trespassing in protest of nuclear testing in  Nevada constitute an act of moral turpitude.    Susan Scott, a State Bar spokeswoman, said state law prohibits comment or  characterization of complaints filed against attorneys.    Myers said complaints have been filed against him in the past for his actions  without any disciplinary action being taken. He said Dutton filed the complaint  to get media attention.    ""Leslie Dutton's consistent tactic has been to file complaints even though she  knows they go nowhere,"" said Myers, who was appointed city attorney in 1981.    Myers said other complaints in connection with his arrests were filed against  him in June, 1987, and a year ago. In both cases, he said, the State Bar  determined that there was insufficient grounds for disciplinary action.    Myers also criticized the ad placed by Dutton's group, saying it gave a false  impression that the city is looking for a city attorney.    ""It is an attempt to prescreen candidates for the office of city attorney,"" he  said. ""She wants to pick people who share her right-wing philosophy if the  measure passes.""    The homeless issue and the ballot measure to make the city attorney an elected  office are expected to be key issues in the race for three seats on the City  Council.    Incumbent Councilwoman Christine Reed has been a vocal opponent of Myers and  has given her support to the ballot measure. Of the nine candidates for City  Council, five oppose Proposition Y.

This Hughes - Australian-born historian and art critic of Time magazine - punishes wayward language with the punchy hostility his namesake Merv hurls down on sloppy batting. That apart, Hughes R. is a lot funnier, particularly sharp on any and all sign of whinging and whining. 'We want to create a sort of linguistic Lourdes, where evil and misfortune are dispelled by a dip in the waters of euphemism'. As a consequence, 'The range of victims available ten years ago  -blacks, chicanos, Indians, women, homosexuals - has now expanded to include every permutation of the halt, the blind, the lame and the short, or, to put it correctly, the differently abled, the other-visioned and the vertically challenged'. Hughes lays about him to left and to right as he expands the thesis into politics, literature, education, and finally into the art world he knows best. The patterns are all of a piece. 'The Gulf War taught us that bombing a place flat was 'servicing a target', or 'visiting a site', that bombing it again to make sure that not even a snake or a thornbush survived was 'revisiting a site'.' For Hughes such fastidious distancings have an inevitable pay-off in the Rushdie affair: 'At home in America it was the height of sexist impropriety to refer to a young female as a 'girl' instead of a 'woman'. Abroad in Tehran, however, it was more or less OK for a cabal of regressive theocratic bigots to murder novelists on State policy. Oppression is what we do in the West. What they do in the Middle East is 'their' culture.' Hughes finds that the new - and sloppy - thinking has chalked up its greatest successes in the area of history. So what Americans teach themselves about slavery is pickled in the prism of political correctness (sic]). 'The solitary guilt of Europe and America continues to haunt discussions of slavery. Africa, Islam and Europe all participated in black slavery, enforced it, profited from its miseries. But in the end, only Europe (including, here, North America) proved itself able to conceive of abolishing it. That we have so-called historians who are prepared to gloss over this fact strikes me as remarkable.' Americans' persistent inability to think straight and write plain causes Hughes endless and barbed grief, supporting his contention that intellectually the country is 'fraying' at the centre as well as at the edges. He reserves some of his sharpest deliveries for the end. Over the Mapplethorpe affair Hughes notes with caustic despair a critical colleague 'reflecting on one photo of a man's fist up his partner's rectum, and another of a finger rammed into a penis, and fluting on about 'the centrality of the forearm' and how it anchors the composition, and how 'the scenes appear to be distilled from real life', and how their formal arrangement 'purifies, even cancels, the prurient elements'. This is the kind of exhausted and literally de-moralised aestheticism that would find no basic difference between a Nuremberg rally and a Busby Berkeley spectacular, since both, after all, are examples of Art-Deco choreography'. The appetite is whetted for a new Hughes television series, American Visions, expected in a year or two. Meantime, we can revel in the racy ruderies of this book.

A local NLRB official, who asked not to be named, said the petition was filed  by a group calling itself the Country Day Teachers Assn., which seeks to  represent teachers, aides, librarians and the school nurse. The school has  about 75 teachers and has never had a union shop, school officials said.    A source familiar with the petition said the teachers decided to organize  partly because of school administrators' treatment of Sharon Rogers after the  March 10 bombing of her van. However, Barbara Judy, the association's  spokeswoman and a kindergarten teacher, refused to confirm that or to say when  the organization drive began. Judy said the petition signatures were gathered  Wednesday.      Caved In to Terrorists?    Rogers, wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III, has said that administrators caved  in to terrorism when they pressured her to resign in exchange for a $140,000  settlement after the bombing. Rogers had taught at the school 12 years and was  teaching a fourth-grade class when she resigned April 28.    The FBI is investigating the bombing as a possible terrorist reprisal. Capt.  Rogers was in command of the guided missile cruiser Vincennes last summer when  a missile fired by the ship mistakenly downed an Iranian passenger jet in the  Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people aboard.    Mark Saxon, newly elected president of the school's board of trustees, said he  does not believe the union bid is related to the school's decision not to renew  Rogers' teaching contract.    ""There's been no indication to me there is any relationship,"" he said.    Judy refused to publicly discuss Rogers' firing, saying that ""we don't like to  air family disputes."" But, she added, ""we certainly know that we have  colleagues who are no longer there for various reasons.""

This follows the arrest over the past week of three policeman, two of them brothers, stationed in Bologna and the Emilia Romagna region. All three are believed to be linked to some 15 unexplained killings and a series of violent robberies dating back to 1988. A pistol found in the possession of one of the arrested policeman has been matched by firearms experts to the killing of a carabiniere and the murder of a prison educationalist. Police are now checking whether the group was protected within the service and allowed to carry out activities to destabilise Emilia Romagna, the region controlled by the former Communist party. The inquiry could also clarify still unexplained aspects of terrorist attacks in Bologna, including the bombing of Bologna station in 1980 that killed 80 people and left 200 injured.

0,FT922-12690 ,"FT922-12690 _AN-CDPBOABMFT 920416   FT  16 APR 92 / Leading Article: Gadaffi in the dock   THE MANDATORY sanctions imposed on Libya yesterday by the UN Security Council were characterised by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, as persuasive rather than punitive. It is an important distinction, since it underlines the difficulties involved in further increasing the pressure on the regime of Col Muammer Gaddafi as a result of its alleged involvement in the bombing of the Pan Am airliner over Scotland in 1988 which killed 270 people. This crude act of terrorism was universally condemned. The desire to bring those responsible to justice is powerful. Col Gadaffi has for the past 20 years enjoyed fanning the flames of conflict within the Middle East and elsewhere in the world, where small groups of violent people have been encouraged to attack governments disliked by Libya. However the depth of international distaste for the man and his methods should not be allowed to dictate the response to the Lockerbie outrage. The effectiveness of sanctions, including the relatively modest ones just imposed on Libya, must always depend on the willingness of the international community to stick to them. The US and British governments, in co-operation with France which has its own arguments with Libya, have won majority support within the Security Council for the measures so far adopted. But they would face far stiffer hurdles in persuading others, including European friends such as Germany, to impose further sanctions and most especially a ban on Libyan oil exports. Alleged criminals There has already been some unease over the apportionment of blame for the Lockerbie bombing and the subsequent use of the Security Council as a vehicle for pursuing alleged criminals. The finger of suspicion, officially guided, pointed first at Syria and Iran. Sceptics suggested that only after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait did it become politically more expedient to concentrate on Libya. The evidence against the two Libyans has been gathered by British and US intelligence. It is not possible for other governments to test the strength of that evidence. By working through the Security Council, Britain and the US are making the UN body the sole instrument of a policy which, if carried to its conclusion, could lead to military action against Libya. Considering the scale of the diplomatic effort needed to put together and hold a common UN position on achieving the liberation of Kuwait, there can be little chance of that process being repeated over the extradition of two men from Libya who have yet to be proven guilty. Strike out The US, supported by Britain, can of course strike out alone as it did in the 1986 bombing raids on Libya. It can be argued that the 1986 raid forced Col Gadaffi to limit support for terrorism. Equally, Lockerbie might have been the response to it. US and Israeli military dominance of the region ensures that such attacks can be carried out with little immediate risk. But whether that is primarily the message which Washington wants to send the Middle East - at a time when it believes the opportunity has never been better for a negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israel conflict - is another matter. Arab friends of the west have been trying to find a compromise, not liking the prospect of sanctions against another Arab state, or of Col Gaddafi being offered a further opportunity to posture as a defiant leader. The majority of Arab League members are happy to see Libya restrained but are concerned about the political impact on their own populations of western actions which could appear vindictive. As they might note, there are other identifiable international criminals against whom there is no threat of prosecution, domestic or international. The international response to terrorism has always had to be one of containment rather than direct retribution. The latest UN sanctions recognise that. Libya should be made to feel the weight of western ostracism for so long as refuses to surrender the two men and does not co-operate more broadly in the battle against terrorists. But Britain and the US would need to think very carefully before adopting harsher measures that fail to win the backing of their main allies.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "

0,FT931-887 ,"FT931-887 _AN-DC1AGAB7FT 930327   FT  27 MAR 93 / When terror takes a toll: How international tourist destinations are affected by political violence      By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, NIKKI TAIT and MARK NICHOLSON   A year ago, the Cairo Sheraton hotel was 75 per cent full. This month, 41 per cent of its rooms are occupied. Some Cairo hotels are just over a third full. One five-star hotel is charging only Dollars 28 a room. The Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the Islamic militant group which is seeking to destabilise the Egyptian government, has deliberately targeted the country's tourist industry. Late last year, gunmen shot at tour buses in Upper Egypt, killing one British visitor. Earlier this year, two visitors were killed when a bomb exploded in a cafe in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Mr Fouad Sultan, the tourism minister, says earnings are down by a fifth on last year. Many in the industry consider that an underestimate. The tourist ministry has hired Burson-Marsteller, the world's biggest public relations company, and Saatchi  Saatchi to help improve the country's image. While terrorism and the murder of foreign visitors can substantially damage a nation's tourism, the effect differs widely from country to country. As Egypt agonises over how to salvage its fastest growing industry and biggest foreign currency earner, the tourist businesses of other countries have been largely unaffected by terrorist and criminal violence. Third world destinations appear to suffer more than developed countries from attacks on tourists. Kenyan tourism was badly hit last year as a result of publicity surrounding the trial of two game rangers accused of the murder of British tourist Julie Ward in 1988, and by reports of other attacks on tourists. By contrast, the murder of a British visitor in Florida last year had little effect on the state's tourism. Thomson, the UK's biggest travel group, said that while the depreciation of the pound against the dollar had deterred some British travellers, reports of violence had little effect. Similarly, Egyptian tourism has been much more severely affected by terrorist incidents than the industries in the UK or the US. Despite years of widely-reported deaths and injuries from IRA bombs, the British tourist industry has suffered little long-term damage. Mr Alan Jefferson, the British Tourist Authority's international marketing director, says his offices abroad usually receive no more than a handful of calls after IRA attacks. One New York travel agent said that, while some US tourists about to leave for the UK had asked about recent IRA bombs, they had decided to go ahead with their trips. The UK tourist industry has been more severely affected by events elsewhere. The US bombing of Libya in 1986 contributed to a 4 per cent fall in visitors to 13.9m, as Americans, fearing terrorist reprisals, stayed at home. The Gulf War resulted in tourists to the UK falling to 16.7m in 1991, from 18m the year before. In the US, the bombing of New York's World Trade Centre last month produced 'no significant cancellations', according to the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau. Airlines servicing the New York area also say that there has been very little impact on passenger traffic. The National Parks Service reports that the number of visitors to New York attractions such as the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island ran at about 3,500-4,000 daily during February, a typical number for the month. While tourist destinations such as Egypt and Kenya might feel they are the victims of double standards, travel industry executives say they suffer from a perception that they are societies under siege. The futures of the US and British governments are not perceived as being threatened by violent crime or terrorism. Although the IRA has bombed areas frequented by tourists, foreign visitors to the UK have not been specific targets as they have in Egypt. Mr Peter Kerkar, chief executive of Cox  Kings Travel, a London-based company, argues that American visitors to the UK are behaving quite logically in ignoring IRA attacks but staying at home during the Gulf War and in the wake of the bombing of Libya. 'The IRA is not singling out Americans. If they're involved in an IRA incident, it's because of bad luck. In the case of Libya, Americans were a target.' One British travel industry manager points out that Florida, while plagued by violent crime, offers tourists a sense of safety, however illusory, that countries such as Kenya and Egypt do not. 'America is familiar territory, where everyone speaks the same language and where half the TV programmes are the ones you see at home.' Mr Martin Brackenbury, president of the International Federation of Tour Operators, says there are a few general principles which countries can apply when attempting to limit the damage caused to tourism by violence. 'The first is: never attempt to cover up. Clearly admit a problem if there is one. The second is to put in place measures which can clearly be seen to be effective,' he says. He says Kenya has responded constructively to Ifto recommendations. The Kenyan government has begun aerial surveillance of game parks and has issued advice about which areas of Nairobi are considered dangerous. Mr Martin Thompson, managing director of the London-based tour operator Abercrombie  Kent, says his business to Kenya fell to 30,000 travellers last year from 34,000 in 1991 as a result of press coverage of violence in the country. However, he expects business to return to 1991 levels this year. The Egyptian authorities, after initially criticising the western media for what it described as a biased, exaggerated campaign, is now taking active steps to restore the country's image. It has supplied more tourist police, troops and helicopters to protect visitors at sites in Upper Egypt. Both the government and the country's tourism industry are now hoping that this iron-fisted policy will stem the terrorist attacks. Mr Taher el-Sharif, chairman of the Egyptian Businessman's Association says: 'The problem is we just don't know when this will stop - unlike the Gulf War, when we knew there would eventually be an end.' Mr Brackenbury says that once a destination is perceived as being safer, recovery for the tourist industry can be swift. 'People's memories are short,' he says.

It was not immediately clear whether the blast was connected with threats by the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to attack Turkish tourist sites. But it coincided with other violence blamed on the PKK. Armed PKK rebels meanwhile kidnapped four French tourists from a bus in south-eastern Turkey. In another incident, a mine planted on a railway exploded near the town of Bingol, derailing a passenger train. Two soldiers protecting the train were killed and three other people on board were injured. Officials blamed the PKK for the attack. Police said the Istanbul bomb had been left in a litter basket under an automated bank teller machine near the sixth-century Haghia Sophia Cathedral. The tourists, two of them Italians, and the Turk were all slightly injured. No damage was reported to the Haghia Sophia, one of the world's most celebrated monuments of Byzantine architecture.

Bombay police chief Amarjeet Singh Samra said one of the men had driven a jeep packed with plastic explosives to a market place in central Bombay. The other had confessed to planting a bomb in the city's crowded jewellery market. Six suspects arrested so far have all been linked to the Memon brothers, smugglers who have since escaped to Dubai. The police allege that the Memons have been involved in the narcotics trade, gun-running, silver smuggling and foreign exchange rackets. Police said the intention of the bombings was to 'disturb the peace in Bombay and take advantage of the turmoil to further their illegal business.' Meanwhile, the death toll in the blast in central Calcutta rose to 80. Police have found no links between the Bombay and Calcutta blasts.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

Weintraub, The following is a discussion of those issues and an  analysis of each by Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub      During Sunday's debate, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and former San Francisco  Mayor Dianne Feinstein made points that were not fully explained and raised  questions that went unanswered. The following is a discussion of those issues  and an analysis of each by Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub:    Issue: Feinstein criticized Van de Kamp for failing to prosecute leaders of the  anti-abortion group Operation Rescue for violation of a court order.    Analysis: The U.S. District Court in March, 1989, ordered members of Operation  Rescue not to interfere with women seeking abortions. But 10 days later, the  group's members barricaded a Los Angeles abortion clinic, and Police Chief  Daryl F. Gates recommended that four Operation Rescue leaders be charged with  felonies. Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner declined to prosecute and referred the matter  to the city attorney for investigation of misdemeanor charges. Abortion rights  groups asked Van de Kamp to take over the case but he declined and stood by  Reiner's decision.    Issue: Van de Kamp questioned Feinstein's feminist credentials, saying that  while she was mayor of San Francisco, the deputy mayor and the directors of  eight ""major"" departments were all men.    Analysis: Van de Kamp's campaign said Monday that he was referring to the  Police and Fire departments, the Airport Department, public health, public  works, social services, the general hospital and the municipal bus service.  Feinstein's campaign did not dispute his contention, but said she appointed the  city's first female city attorney and first female treasurer. As for Van de  Kamp's record as attorney general, his 19-member executive staff includes seven  women.    Issue: Feinstein charged that Van de Kamp, because he opposes capital  punishment, would ""commute every single case"" of those sentenced to death.    Analysis: Even if Van de Kamp wanted to commute every sentence, he almost  certainly could not do so. The state Constitution prohibits the governor from  commuting the sentences of twice-convicted felons except on the recommendation  of a majority of the state Supreme Court. Most of the more than 275 inmates on  California's Death Row have been convicted of more than one felony. The Supreme  Court, dominated by appointments of conservative Gov. George Deukmejian, would  not be expected to go along with such a strategy.    Issue: Feinstein said crime went down 20% in San Francisco while she was mayor,  and she charged that ""violent crime"" increased 20% statewide since Van de Kamp  became attorney general.    Analysis: Feinstein's reference to her own record on crime includes only the  most serious offenses. According to the San Francisco Police Department, all  crime increased 0.1% during her tenure, and arrests for so-called ""Part II""  offenses -- including arson, narcotics, carrying weapons, embezzlement,  prostitution and drunk driving -- increased 30.9%.    Statewide, the number of arrests for violent crimes has increased 19.8% since  1983, according to ""Crime and Delinquency in California,"" a 1988 report  published by Van de Kamp's Justice Department. The definition of violent crime  included murder, rape, robbery, assault and kidnaping. Those figures include a  dramatic increase in assaults reported in 1986 after the definition of that  crime was expanded to include domestic violence.    Issue: Van de Kamp charged that Feinstein would put cost-of-living increases  for education programs ""on the table"" in her search for ways to close the  state's current $3.6-billion budget gap.    Analysis: Feinstein has said that she would consider any proposal to increase  revenues or cut the budget. The kindergarten-through-community college portion  of the education budget is protected by voter-approved Proposition 98, but the  provisions of that measure could be suspended for one year by a two-thirds vote  of each house of the Legislature.

Apart from the murder of the teenage daughter of one of the defendants, there was no evidence that the accused members of the Abu Nidal group carried out their plans or were connected with the February 26 bombing of the New York World Trade Centre that killed six people and wounded over 1,000. The charges were announced by the Justice Department a day after it was returned in secret by a federal grand jury in St Louis, Missouri. Accused were Tawfiq Musa of Milwaukee and Zein Isa, Saif Nijmeh and Luie Nijmeh, all from St Louis. Isa already had been in custody while the three others were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday. They were all charged with conducting a criminal racketeering enterprise since 1986.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

That is what comes to  mind when you look at the official hysteria that has unfolded in  the United States over the arrest of the Ames couple, who have  been charged with spying for Russia. They have been under  surveillance for over 10 months. The President was informed of  all the suspicions, which did not stop him visiting Moscow and  agreeing on a ""mature partnership"" with Russia. And now  suddenly the Ameses have been dragged into broad daylight, like  the old marshal's kepi, so that Washington has something to  stamp on in anger.    One can hardly say seriously that this entire tale of  espionage, which has caused a major cold spell in relations  between Moscow and Washington, was the reason for this cooling.  In actual fact, people in the U.S. capital are bound to realize  that Russia, even if the charges against the Ameses do accord  with reality, did not go beyond what is permissible. After all,  as far as one can judge from articles in the press, Ames  informed the Russian special services about U.S. agents  operating in Russia. To be honest, Russia's desire to find out  which of its citizens is working for a foreign state is quite  justified.    But what is the real reason then for the demarches, in which  all the administration's top leaders have been involved? To  tell the truth I do not think that people who link what is  happening with the ratification of this year's U.S. intelligence  budget are right. After all, the prestige of the CIA has not so  much been strengthened as weakened. And, what is more, given  the really serious uncertainty in the world it is hardly  necessary to use scandalous arrests of foreign agents to  persuade congressmen of the need to allocate money for the  special services' activity.    Those who link the hysteria in Washington with Russia's  unexpected and extremely successful Bosnian settlement  initiative are closer to the truth. The initiative as such is  not the issue, however. Since, if we are talking about the crux  of the matter, Moscow's initiative has indeed eased the  implementation of the Western approach to the settlement. It  has enabled the Serbs to ""keep face"" and NATO members to avoid  an utterly unprecedented operation that would be the prologue to  a long and bloody conflict. Russia has found a solution  acceptable to everyone. Moreover it risked its soldiers' lives  in doing so.    So what has driven Washington berserk? In my view, Moscow's  successful initiative in the Balkans confirmed once and for all  the fundamental changes in Russian foreign policy. Changes for  which U.S. strategic planning made no provision at all. After  all, over the last few years Washington has already gotten  accustomed to feeling that it is the only world leader, the only  superpower. This power could dare to ignore world public opinion  when missile and bombing raids were inflicted on Iraq. It can  even put up with the obvious fiasco of Somalia. And its world  lead does not seem to have been disputed at all. At least no  alternatives were given.    But this time the United States found itself on the  sidelines  of the settlement process owing to the actions taken by Russia,  which it had long since struck off the list of main participants  in international politics. But no, in everyone's eyes Russia  remained an important, perhaps the most important factor in  world politics. A passive inward-looking factor, so to speak.  Russia was primarily of interest to the rest of the world  because of the dangers that will arise if disturbances or civil  war break out in a country that not only has nuclear but also  other destructive potential. And so, in order not to ""cause  trouble,"" the West, primarily the United States, was willing to  provide some financial and economic aid for Russian reforms and  mostly talk endlessly about the terms of this support. With the  same end in view -- in order not to elicit a pathological  reaction from the Russian public -- our country continued to be  ritually called a great power and invited to take part in  resolving various global problems, without being thought capable  of really accomplishing anything.    People say that fashion reflects people's ideas. Thus,  ""Russian refugee"" style is gaining a foothold in the world:  shapeless pants, a vest, and a shawl worn on top of a sweater  with the ends tied at the back. Like it or not, that is how we  are seen. Yet suddenly it emerges that Russia, which had  already been written off, is beginning not only to announce but  also to implement an active foreign policy course. It is not  enough that it is resolutely promoting reintegration within the  CIS and trying to carry out peacekeeping functions in nearby  foreign countries. The West could have somehow put up with that.  But a country in crisis is being successful in an area where  Western states have been impotently marking time for two years  now. It emerges that, despite its own crisis and the  occasionally obvious inconsistency in its policy, Russia still  has considerable prestige, and quite possibly not just in the  Balkans....    The question now is, as France's LE FIGARO wrote, how far  the  United States is prepared to agree to the expansion of Russian  influence. At the moment Washington is displaying its  irritation.    Someone has been very skillful and timely in bringing up the  Ameses. After all, the incident is extremely useful for those  circles that have no interest in a real partnership between the  West and Russia. And these circles exist in virtually all  countries. MAINICHI SHIMBUN has just reported that  U.S.-Japanese staff exercises are still being conducted, based  on the possibility of a Russian attack on Hokkaido. Now, when  the sides are reassessing their own role and the role of  partner, those people who feel uncomfortable in the present  situation may quite easily see their chance. They could quite  easily try to use the cold spell to once again dig up the ""enemy  image"" that we are long since sick of.    Yet one cannot say that their plans are totally groundless.  The train of events shows that the switch to new relations with  the West has by no means become irreversible. The old fears and  old ways rear their heads again at the slightest complication.  And menacing speeches can already be heard in the U.S.  Congress. A Russian diplomat has already been expelled like  during those memorable times. And this at a time when the U.S.  President has over the last few days clearly been backpedaling,  reluctant to jeopardize the whole set of Russian-U.S. relations.  However the conflict seems to have the potential to escalate on  its own.    A great deal now depends on Russia. It must retain calm  dignity. One can hardly talk seriously about its meeting the  absolutely unacceptable demand for the unilateral cessation of  intelligence activity in the United States. But it is also  important not to succumb to provocation today. We are by and  large being incited to make brusque statements. Firmness is  what is needed here. It is necessary to show the United States  and other Western states from the example of recent crises that  a partnership with Russia is indeed a vital necessity for  everyone. And that the rules of conduct within this partnership  are the same for everyone. That there are not junior partners  who must know their place and not interfere in the adults'  conversations and actions. Nor are there any older partners who  have the right to put children in their place or even just vent  their spleen on them.     "

Amir Abdoul said he had gone to Main Street and 14th Place, as he often does,  to hire one or two workers to move large rolls of carpeting and fabric for his  company, Express Delivery Service. Instead, he was confronted first by Javier  Felix, a 21-year-old Mexican immigrant, who said he had not been paid for a  day's work he performed last month.    Soon, half a dozen other laborers who said they had also worked for Abdoul  approached the startled entrepreneur, along with others showing ""solidarity""  with their fellow workers.    Abdoul denied having cheated the workers and no arrests were made.

Competition for jobs is tough. When pickups and other trucks approach the  intersection, groups of men sometimes push and shove each other in a desperate  bid to reach the prospective employer first.    Unable to find employment for several days, at least a dozen men currently  sleep on the sidewalk along 14th Place. And even those able to find work say  they are sometimes paid as little as $20 for a full day's hard labor.    So, when Abdoul arrived at the intersection and was challenged by Felix,  several of the immigrant men said they saw it as an opportunity to release  their frustration and anger.

After working eight  hours lifting rugs at several sites downtown, he said he asked for the $40  promised him by Abdoul. But the boss was nowhere to be found at the end of the  day and Abdoul's other employees merely shrugged their shoulders when Felix  asked for his pay.    Abdoul acknowledged hiring Felix. But he added that the day laborer had worked  only half a day and then quit because Abdoul denied him a lunch break.    The entrepreneur said he was surprised to see Felix again Wednesday, this time  banging at the window of his truck.    Abdoul said he would no longer be hiring men at the intersection.    ""I'm not coming here anymore. This is my last time"" he said. ""It's too crazy.""    Police officers separated the angry day laborers from Abdoul, suggesting that  the workers go to the state labor commissioner's office on nearby Broadway to  file a complaint.

I would like to ask you the following  question: We do not know very well what is going on; all we know  is that bombing took place. What can it lead to, and what has  it already lead to? Please give us your opinion.    [Achulova] Actually, I know what you and many of our  compatriots and members of the [word indistinct] committee know,  namely that air raids took place in the town of Gorazde in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The natural reaction to this fact [pauses]  the mere fact that NATO forces attempted to solve the problems  of a conflict existing there in a unilateral fashion by  conducting an air raid caused a certain reaction. There were  some casualties, which is a fact that is worthy of attention in  itself. Apart from other issues, I think this amounts to  interference in the emerging trend in the peace process place.  It caused diplomats to be very concerned, and I think the same  applies to all members of the Security Council. Today, the mere  decision to use the Air Force, that is, to use force to solve  problems as complex as the conflict existing there may generate  the most negative opinions, conclusions and statements, and not  only in the State Duma which I represent, but also in all  parliaments of the world.    [Lomakin] Some of the politicians wondered if Russian  prestige has been damaged. It is no secret that we have  significant interests in this region -- at least they should be.  How can this affect Russian prestige?    [Achulova] The mere fact of what has taken place can  naturally affect Russian prestige, but as to the moral  responsibility of such an organization as the UN, it can also  affect the authority of this organization. In my opinion, and  in the opinion of many of my colleagues, the mechanism for  adopting such decisions is incorrect. As you know, Russia itself  was an initiator in the UN Security Council of the proposal to  never use force to solve such problems, and naturally the use of  force in Bosnia-Herzegovina causes a certain amount of damage to  Russia, to Russian diplomacy. It is a separate issue that the  procedure itself for adopting such decisions has been breached,  and no consultations with any member of the Security Council  were held. In other words, the right for NATO to use air  support was guaranteed by the UN secretary general. Therefore, I  think that naturally there was in any case some moral damage  here because our position on this is known. On the other hand,  I think that this causes a certain amount of damage to the UN  Security Council.    [Lomakin] As far as I know, the duma adopted a statement on  this issue yesterday evening. As I understand it, this is the  State Duma reaction. Could you comment on the adopted statement?    [Achulova] Indeed, the State Duma adopted a decision on this  issue yesterday. The State Duma calls the public's attention to  the deep concern felt by all deputies of the State Duma over the  air raid in the town of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  statement also emphasizes that the use of force without early  consultations with members of the Security Council, and the  Russian representative among them, was against the policy of the  State Duma as expressed in both official statements and in  speeches of deputies and representatives of various factions.  Naturally, [the statement] stresses the need for peaceful  settlement of this process and a return to the negotiating  process. It also contains points clearly suggesting that the UN  convene the Security Council to discuss extensively the  situation created in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a result of this air  raid.    [Lomakin] Let me ask you a question which you do not have to  answer. However, if you do answer it, I will be very happy. As  far as I understand, this is the first time that the UN used  NATO forces. Do you not have the feeling that Russia and its  position on this issue is being felt out, and if Russia gives in  on some issues then, hypothetically speaking, other steps might  follow?    [Achulova] You know, this statement of the State Duma does  not contain such a position, and it has not been discussed in  the committee for foreign affairs. However, as a deputy I can  say that personally I do not rule out such a possibility, such a  cause for delivering this strike because, from the logical point  of view, carrying out such a barbarous act in Bosnia-Herzegovina  [pauses] nevertheless, the statement notes that the State Duma  finds it necessary to deploy UN forces in this zone, and  emphasizes that the NATO forces were used in a unilateral  fashion. What is more, one of the very serious problems being  discussed in the mass media is the concept which we must join, a  partnership we must join, a partnership which Russia must sign  on 21 April. Nevertheless, one of the articles of this  statement recommends, in a very proper manner, that the  appropriate committee of the State Duma, such as the committees  for foreign affairs, geopolitics, and security fully take  Russian interests into consideration when working out the  approach of the State Duma to the concept of Russian cooperation  with NATO. I think that this was not done without a reason.  Therefore, I think that Russian policy regarding this conflict  must be consistent, and must in any case exclude the use of  force to solve this very complex problem. [The statement] again  calls warring sides to sit at the negotiating table, avoid any  casualties, and activate the position of Russian Federation  Foreign Ministry in order to create an effective mechanism for  the implementation of resolutions of the UN security Council.    [Lomakin] Thank you, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. Like many other  Russians, I still hope that the peacekeeping process has the  upper hand, because there is probably no other way in Europe.    [Achulova] Yes, that is very important.    [Lomakin] We are too close to each other in Europe. Thank  you  again. We have talked about the position the State Duma adopted  yesterday evening on bombing of Serb positions in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We had with us Aleksandra Vasilyevna  Achulova, deputy chairman of the State Duma committee for  foreign affairs. Thank you again.     "

0,FT922-12599 ,"FT922-12599 _AN-CDPBOAD5FT 920416   FT  16 APR 92 / Libyan flights blocked as UN sanctions begin      By TONY WALKER and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS      CAIRO, NEW YORK   LIBYA challenged the United Nations air embargo imposed yesterday by proceeding with scheduled flights to destinations in Europe and the Middle East - but its aircraft were turned back. At the same time the US, Japan and a number of European countries said they would expel Libyan diplomats in accordance with UN sanctions. In Tripoli, the Libyan news agency Jana said 'reciprocal measures' had begun against states imposing sanctions. It did not give details, but it is likely western diplomats in the Libyan capital will be sent home in retaliation. The sanctions, passed on March 31, follow Libya's refusal to hand over two men indicted in the west on suspicion of planting the bomb that destroyed Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988. Libya's neighbour, Egypt, became the first Arab country to enforce the air embargo when it informed Tripoli that Egyptian airspace was closed. A foreign ministry official in Cairo said Egypt 'respects international legality'. Libyan Arab Airlines flights were also turned back by Tunisia and Switzerland, which has implemented sanctions even though it is not a member of the UN. Two Italian air force jets were scrambled to deter a Libyan Boeing 727 from entering Italy's airspace. Japan's announcement that it would expel Libyan diplomats was followed by similar statements from the US, Sweden, Italy and France. A reduction in Libya's 16-member UN delegation in New York is to be announced soon. The US has no diplomatic links with Tripoli. However, the UK said that two Libyan envoys in Britain, working from the Saudi Arabian embassy, would remain in their posts - at least while two British diplomats still operated from the Italian embassy in Tripoli. UN Resolution 748 bans the international movement of Libyan Arab Airlines, bars the shipment of arms to Libya and requires a reduction in Libyan diplomatic representation. Under the sanctions, Libya is also required to turn over four men allegedly involved in the bombing of a UTA jet in 1989 over Niger, and to take concrete steps to disassociate itself from terrorism. Hours after sanctions came into effect the UN Security Council set up a committee to oversee implementation and deal with requests for exemptions. These are expected mainly to allow foreign workers to fly out of Libya. Resolution 748 empowers the sanctions committee to allow flights 'on grounds of significant humanitarian need'. The UK and US stressed that the sanctions resolution was mandatory. 'The Council means business,' warned Sir David Hannay, UK ambassador to the UN, noting that governments had until May 15 to report on measures taken to implement the embargo. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, interviewed on BBC radio, said continued Libyan intransigence could prompt the US, Britain and France into considering an oil embargo against Tripoli. 'That's obviously something that could be considered for the future,' he said, though Foreign Office officials said such an embargo was not yet under discussion. The streets of the Libyan capital were reported to be calm but Libya's official media maintained a barrage of criticism against the west. Libyan Radio accused the US, Britain and France of 'renewing their colonial attempt' to bring down the regime. It accused the west of seeking to 'make up for the failure' of the US bombing raid six years ago, when the US targeted Colonel Muammer Gad-affi's headquarters in an apparent attempt to eliminate him.

Crusaders on both sides of the abortion issue were to begin fanning out before  dawn today to family planning clinics. Locations in many cases were kept secret  until the last minute to stymie police -- and the other side.      Sit-Ins, Pickets    Members of the New York-based Operation Rescue anti-abortion organization,  moving a national campaign to the Los Angeles area, said they will stage  sit-ins and put up pickets at three to five clinics each day to prevent women  from obtaining abortions.    ""Operation Rescue is going to have to obey the law,"" Mayor Tom Bradley said  Wednesday in pledging that police will arrest demonstrators who interfere with  patients. ""The public needs to know that we're not going to permit someone to  come into this town, violate the law, disrupt this community and think they're  going to get away with it.""    The Los Angeles Police Department, stung by charges that it has been too  lenient on Operation Rescue members in the past, promised to keep clinic doors  clear of rallying demonstrators who illegally try to block them.    Police opened an emergency operations center downtown to coordinate security  efforts and planned to set up command posts -- complete with field jail units  -- wherever protests spring up. Extra officers will be on patrol or on standby  in Los Angeles and in other suburban cities and will be deployed as needed,  police spokesmen said.    Four City Council members also announced that they will attend demonstrations  to guarantee that police safeguard the clinics. ""Operation Rescue is kind of  like the Ayatollah Khomeini approach to public policy,"" Councilman Richard  Alatorre said.      No Arrests Made    The Police Department came under fire last month when Operation Rescue staged  protests that forced two clinics to close, yet no arrests were made. Members of  the City Council two weeks ago demanded -- and finally received -- assurances  that police will enforce trespassing and other laws to keep anti-abortion  demonstrators at bay. A federal court on March 2 ordered demonstrators to  remain 15 feet from clinic entrances.    Several clinic operators and pro-choice organizations, in meetings leading up  to this week's events, questioned whether some police leaders were sympathetic  with the anti-abortion forces, especially since several top commanders,  including the department's second in command, Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon,  are fundamentalist Christians.    Vernon, who is in charge of security operations during the days of protest,  said anti-abortion activists will not be allowed to break the law. ""I'm going  to uphold the laws of this city,"" Vernon said in an interview.    Operation Rescue has stood out among anti-abortion groups because of its  militant, '60s-style tactics. On Wednesday, the Right to Life League of  Southern California, one of largest such groups in the nation, said it  understood Operation Rescue's frustration and the ""sense of urgency to end this  American holocaust"" but said it could not support its methods.    In another attempt to place a last-minute obstacle in the path of the  anti-abortion forces, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California  filed civil contempt charges against Operation Rescue in federal court on  Wednesday. The ACLU contends that Operation Rescue has defied the court order.    Demonstrators have disrupted health care services at various clinics in Fresno,  Chico, San Diego and Oakland and have ""terrorized health-care clinic clients  and flagrantly disregarded the law,"" Carol Sobel, ACLU attorney, charged during  a press conference.    A hearing in U.S. District Court is set for April 24, and the suit will be  amended to include the names of those arrested during this week's  demonstrations, she added. The suit names Operation Rescue and its Southern  California organizers, Jeff White, Joseph Foreman and Randy Adler, and 100  other unnamed people.    ""We believe they need more than a $25 fine and a slap on the wrist,"" Sobel  said. ""If they face losing their homes and jobs they will think twice about  what they are doing.""    But Operation Rescue has ignored thousands of dollars in fines as a result of  similar incidents throughout the country.    Operation Rescue leaders, meanwhile, held what they billed as a press  conference in a hotel in Orange, near their headquarters. Rather than answer  questions, however, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry displayed what he  said was a 19-week-old fetus that had been aborted.    ""Ask the dead baby your questions,"" the 29-year-old former car salesman told  startled reporters before he and his entourage rushed out.    The organization is predicting that about 3,500 of its members -- many flown in  from other parts of the country -- will join the demonstrations, designed to  coincide with Holy Week.    The organization, made up mainly of religious fundamentalists, has justified  its sometimes illegal tactics by contending that it is ""saving lives and will  only obey higher laws.""      Tension High at Clinics    On the eve of the planned protests, tension was high at the approximately 90  clinics in Southern California. Many clinic directors reported that their  clients have been frightened away from scheduled appointments out of fear of  confronting Operation Rescue picketers.    At the nine clinics run by Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles, the staff has  been calling all clients with scheduled appointments to let them know of the  possible confrontations, and to give them the option of rescheduling.    ""A few have rescheduled but the majority (have) not,"" said Janice Sinclaire,  Planned Parenthood spokeswoman. ""More often than not, the women have gotten  very angry because their right to privacy and health care is at stake, and they  say they will not be stopped.""    Pro-choice forces promise to be out in numbers to escort women trying to enter  clinics and discourage Operation Rescue operatives.    ""It's siege mentality. Isn't it sick?"" said Patricia O'Neil, associate director  of the Feminist Women's Health Center in the mid-Wilshire area. ""How would the  public react if this were happening in a cancer clinic? The public would not  tolerate it.""    In scores of sit-ins around the country during the last year, including  Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia and Sunnyvale, Calif., Operation Rescue claims  20,000 arrests of its members, straining courts and jails in each targeted  city.    Los Angeles county and city officials are bracing for what a flood of arrests  will do to already-overburdened facilities.    In Los Angeles, arrested demonstrators will be booked at field jail units,  temporary processing posts that are not designed to actually hold people. Some  will be released and others, including those who refuse to give their real  names, will be jailed.

By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES      BELFAST, Northern Ireland      The Irish Republican Army executed its most deadly attacks on British forces in  two years Wednesday, forcing civilians to deliver car bombs that killed six  soldiers in nearly simultaneous incidents at two border checkpoints. One  civilian also died and at least 20 people were wounded, officials said.    According to the widow of the civilian victim, Patsy Gillespie, he was ordered  by IRA gunmen to drive a car packed with an estimated 1,000 pounds of  explosives into the Londonderry border post about 4 a.m. Gillespie and five  soldiers were killed, and 10 people were injured.    About 15 minutes later, a van exploded at a checkpoint south of Newry, although  the driver, a 65-year-old man whose family was being held hostage by the IRA,  was able to shout a warning before the bomb went off. One soldier died and 10  others were wounded in that incident.    The driver at Newry suffered a broken leg as he dashed from the car seconds  before it blew up.    The blasts at opposite ends of the province were believed to be in retaliation  for the fatal shooting two weeks ago of Dessie Grew, a leading IRA gunman  suspected of several killings in Northern Ireland and Europe.    The day's violence could have been even worse. A third car bomb, piloted by a  man who had been beaten and tied to the driver's seat, failed to explode fully  outside a police station in Omagh, about midway between the sites of the two  other blasts.    All three coerced drivers apparently were targeted by the IRA because they  worked in British security installations -- an IRA tactic, in effect, to kill  two birds with one stone.

An official statement  issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the shelling  by Serbs of a busy market in Sarajevo was an act against the  norms which respect human dignity. The attack, which wounded 200  innocent people, must be condemned as it constituted a brutal  act, unacceptable to civilised people, the statement said.    ""This incident should call for the attention of the  international community that settlement of conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is now on a very pressing stage,"" the  statement said.    Strong reactions also came from other countries such as the  Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC), China, Pakistan,  Bangladesh. Germany, France, the United States, and Turkey, in  principle, they called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) to launch an air strike for the liberation of Sarajevo  from the siege of Bosnian Serbs, the daily said.

Vivekanand]    [Excerpts] Amman--Twenty-three people charged with plotting  and carrying out attacks aimed at destabilising internal  security will be put on trial in mid-April, official sources  said Sunday. [passage omitted]    At least six of the suspects have confessed to have planted  the explosive devices that went off at the Rivoli and Salwa  theatres as well as others which were discovered at a  supermarket outside Amman and the Zahran cinema, local reports  said. [passage omitted]    The sources said most of them are from lower middle class  families and some of them would be charged as accessories before  and after the crime.    It was not clear from the reports how many of the suspects  knew each other. They were all said to have worked separately,  as small groups, unaware of each other, under the guidance of  one or more people.    According to the reports, one of the suspects, Muhammad  'Adaribah, told interrogators that he tried and failed to plant  a bomb at the Rivoli, in downtown Amman, one week before the  Jan. 26 blast.    The device, described as a time-bomb that actually went off  inside the theatre at midnoon, was planted by another suspect,  Yasin Zahrah, the reports said. Seven people were injured in  the blast.    The youth who planted the bomb which was discovered and  defused at Amman's Zahran cinema was identified as Samir Ahmad,  who told police that he was asked to plant the bomb by Muhammad  Shihadah, a construction material salesman from the al-Baq'ah  refugee camp.    Mr. Ahmad was reported to have met Mr. Shihadah, described  as  an Arab Afghan, in front of the al-Husayni Mosque in downtown  Amman to inform him that he had planted the bomb inside the  theatre.    Mr. Shihadah, who is also under detention, was also  implicated in the al-Zarqa' bombing by the man who confessed to  have planted the device, 'Id Jahalin, a 30-year-old plumber from  al-Baq'ah.    Mr. Jahalin lost his limbs in the explosion when the bomb  exploded prematurely. His confession from his hospital bed is  believed to have been the most significant breakthrough in the  case.    The suspects also took interrogators to 'Akrush Supermarket  in Safut, which straddles the main road between Amman and  al-Baq'ah camp, and reenacted the planting of the device which  was discovered and defused there a few days before the Rivoli  blast.    Mr. Zahrah, the man who reportedly confessed to the Rivoli  explosion, was also identified as the one who planted the bomb  at the supermarket.    Another target of the suspects was the sprawling Housing  Bank  complex in the heart of Amman, according to the reports.    Some of the suspects showed interrogators how ``they cased  the joint to determine where to plant the bombs'' but no  explosives were actually placed in the complex.    Apart from Mr. 'Adaribah, Mr. Zahrah, Mr. Ahmad, Mr.  Shihadah  and Mr. Jahalin, other suspects identified by name included  Hasan Hamdan and Sulayman Biyah.    All the bombs were said to have used crude technology widely  employed by the Afghan rebels in their battle against the Red  Army and Soviet-supported government soldiers in Afghanistan.    The bombing case is the second known organised sabotage  attributed to ``Arab Afghans'' in Jordan.    In 1991, members of a group called ``Jaysh Muhammad  (Muhammad's Army)'' made up mostly of Afghan returnees were  arrested following a series of attacks and foiled attempts  against night-clubs, cinemas, liquor shops and security officers  as well as government buildings and diplomatic missions.    Eighteen of them were tried and convicted; eight of them,  two  in absentia, were given the death sentence, and others were  jailed for terms ranging from two years to 15 years.

""It was rather narrow, cars were stopping, and people were sticking out of the  cars dealing drugs,"" Holden recalled.    Guiding his own car carefully through the street, Holden, accompanied by his  brother, Reggie, avoided eye contact with the dealers, hoping to stay out of  trouble.    Then suddenly, in another block, the dealers disappeared.    ""There was nothing,"" Holden said. ""It was kids out riding bicycles and I'm  seeing these signs saying, 'Drug-Free Zone.' ""    The Pasadena director had stumbled upon a tactic touted as the cornerstone of  New Jersey's 2-year-old, anti-drug effort. The white signs, with blue letters  spelling out ""Drug-Free Zone,"" mark off areas 1,000 feet around schoolyards.  Individuals caught dealing drugs inside these zones face mandatory prison  sentences of three to five years.    With added officers on regular patrols in the zones, New Jersey reported 6,509  arrests last year under the new law and 4,700 during the first half of this  year. Dealers know the state is serious and respect the boundaries, New Jersey  officials say. As a result, they say, the streets surrounding schools are  washed clean of curbside dealers.    Holden, elected in March on an anti-crime platform, returned to Pasadena,  determined to start drug-free zones here using a similar California law. During  the fall, he advanced the idea through a board subcommittee that included  Director Bill Paparian and Mayor William Thomson, also known for his anti-drug  stance.    It was Thomson who last week publicly unveiled the plan for the creation of  drug- free zones, as part of an anti-drug and alcohol-abuse package. The Board  of Directors on Tuesday formally endorsed the concept of declaring drug-free  zones in Pasadena. When the board adopts specific anti-drug legislation next  year, Pasadena could become only the second city in California to declare such  zones, city officials said.    But successful drug-free zones involve more than just the posting of signs,  Holden said Tuesday. Cooperation also must come from residents of drug-infested  neighborhoods, police officers who make arrests there and prosecutors who file  charges.    Thomson agreed, saying: ""Signs by themselves will be helpful, but they are not  going to win the day.""    Pasadena officials will enlist the help of the Pasadena Unified School  District, the city attorney and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's  Office in devising its drug-free zones.    The idea for such zones originated four years ago with revisions to the U.S.  Health and Safety Code, which called for a one-year minimum prison term for  those convicted of selling drugs, such as heroin, marijuana, hashish, cocaine,  PCP (also known as ""angel dust"") or LSD within 100 feet of playgrounds and  video arcades and within 1,000 feet of schools.    The law's effectiveness was hampered, however, by the quantities of drugs  required to be seized before the added charges could be filed. As a result, 29  states enacted their own legislation.    California's year-old version applies only to convictions for the sale of rock  cocaine, also known as crack, and only for sales that occur within 1,000 feet  of a schoolyard.    Among states that have enacted such legislation, New Jersey has led the way in  aggressively using drug-free zones to fight dealers. The New Jersey zones were  created as part of a broad, statewide anti-drug effort devised in 1987 by Gov.  Thomas Kean and former State Atty. Gen. Corey Edwards.    A statewide action plan that accompanied the legislation requires all New  Jersey cities to conduct regular police patrols in their drug-free zones. In  Elizabeth, that meant city officials had to add seven more officers to the  narcotics squad, said Elizabeth Police Director Joseph Brennan.    Once arrests were made in the zones and convicted dealers were sent to prison,  other dealers realized the state was serious and began to avoid the zones,  Brennan said. However, it took some time.    ""It's a deterrent, but it's a long-term effect,"" he said of the signs.    Much of New Jersey's success with its drug-free zones can be attributed to the  state's unique, hierarchical political system, said State Assistant Atty. Gen.  Ron Susswein. The governor appoints the state attorney general and state  prosecutors who oversee local police chiefs.    In other areas across the nation, using school zones as an anti-drug tactic is  not nearly as organized or aggressive, Susswein said. Neighboring New York  state counted only 10 prosecutions last year under its drug-free zone laws, he  said. Meanwhile, only a few cities, such as Omaha, Neb., and a few states, such  as Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, have gone to the trouble of actually  posting drug- free zone signs to accompany their laws.    Alameda, in Northern California, is the only city in the state to post such  signs.    Reasoning that most streets in the small city of 75,000 would fall within 1,000  feet of a schoolyard, the council in November, 1988, simply posted the  drug-free zone signs at the city's four entry routes.    ""It's definitely symbolic,"" said Cheryl Mitchell Wade, an assistant to the city  manager. ""We haven't added any additional resources.""    In Los Angeles, signs are not posted. But periodic high-profile, citywide  sweeps by undercover law-enforcement officers are undertaken, in which both  federal and state laws are used against those arrested. In October, 1988, one  such operation netted 83 arrests. Another 177 people were arrested last June.    But generally, the use of drug- free zone laws is left up to law- enforcement  agencies handling the cases. John Perlstein, who oversees the filing of cases  in downtown Los Angeles for the county district attorney's office, estimates  that 1%, or 130, of the estimated 13,000 felony drug cases filed each year  downtown include added penalties for dealing near schoolyards.    In the Pasadena office, where about 2,000 felony narcotics cases are filed  annually, head filing deputy Jim Simpson could recall using the new California  law only once.    But Simpson said police agencies fail to request the added penalties when they  send cases to the district attorney for prosecution.    ""I see an (arrest) address, and I don't know if it's 1,000 feet within a  schoolyard,"" Simpson said.    The problem, said Perlstein, is that no coherent program exists to take  advantage of the drug-free zone laws on the books.    ""We're pretty fragmented in Los Angeles County,"" he said. ""We have 70 different  police departments with separate prosecuting jurisdictions.""    Those problems will be addressed as Pasadena works out the details of its  proposal with the school district, the Police Department and the district  attorney's office, Holden said.    He added: ""My feeling is that in a couple of years from now, you'll find more  and more cities involved in it.""

Some cases have been attributed to the effects of allied bombing of chemical works, others to burning oil wells. Inoculation with drugs - some experimental - to protect troops against chemical and biological warfare has also been targeted as a possible cause. One way or another at the moment, half one's conversation seems to be about law and order. Question Time (BBC1, 10.30) concentrates on the subject with a special edition and a panel which includes George Carmen, QC, perhaps still pink with triumph from Virgin Atlantic's libel victory over British Airways. Stephen Poliakoff's Close My Eyes (C4, 10.00) does a lot for brother-sister incest and even serves the London's Docklands landscape rather well.

In a press conference held recently, Baghdad Mayor Tahir  Muhammad Hassun shed light on the environmental hazards that  ensured from the direct and indirect effects of the U.S.-led  aggression against Iraq. In an urgent call to international and  humanitarian organisations all over the world, Mr. Hassun urged  for an immediate action to save the Iraqi environment.    The ""Baghdad Call"" aims at attracting the world's attention  to the great damage inflicted by the U.S.-allied war and the  continuation of the economic sanctions, the mayor said. He  added that Iraq's environment has been greatly affected by the  barbaric bombing by allied forces during the U.S.-led military  aggression, indicating that the destruction of electric power  faculties and water and waste water treatment plants has led to  a cycle of contamination.    The mayor added that Baghdad is calling for help because the  embargo has greatly affected the level of municipal services,  noting that Baghdad is some 900 square kilometres in area and  has a 4.5 million population. He said Baghdad city is divided  into some 1.3 [figure as received] municipal units has some 467  residential quarters. The mayor added that due to the  continuation of the embargo the average water delivery has  decreased from 45 liters per capita per day (L/C/D) before the  war to reach some 18 liters per capita per day after the war.    The mayor elaborated that severe damage has been inflicted  upon water and waste water treatment plants. Moreover, fresh  sewage is either overflowing in the streets or being discharged  into the Tigris and the Euphrates without any treatment.  Furthermore, allied bombing of roads and lack of spare parts  needed to carry out maintenance because of the sanctions had  caused cracks in sewer lines which in consequence caused ground  water contamination. Many of these systems are either out of  operation or operated at a reduced capacity because of pump  breakdown, said the mayor.    The ultimate threat is posed by the large quantities of  sewage which flow untreated into the country's two major rivers  and run downstream. These rivers, the Euphrates and Tigris,  constitute the main water sources of the country, said the  mayor, adding that some 50 per cent, that is some five cubic  metres per second sewage water is being pumped directly into  rivers.    He added that Baghdad outskirts are still suffering from  lack  of potable water, noting that about one-third of Baghdad city  lacks waste-water treatment system due to the stoppage of work  on sewage and waste-water treatment projects due to lack of  spare parts and materials due to the sanctions.    Moreover, the work of waste collecting vehicles is hampered  by lack of maintenance and spare parts causing in consequence  heaps of garbage in residential quarters of Baghdad, noting that  the number of workers has also decreased from 6332 to some 2500  ones.    Solid waste disposal has been disrupted, consequently  causing  air pollution because people often tend to incinerate rubbish,  said the mayor.    Mr. Hassun added that the sanctions have also brought work  on  renovation project of Baghdad city of a standstill, noting that  work on the said project has started in 1980s. He added that  the project aims at renovating and refurbishing ancient and  historical sites and holy shrines and historical mosques and  churches.    Mr. Hassun warned of the spread of epidemics saying that  people of Baghdad city suffer from the wide spread of epidemics  resulting from environmental pollution, the accumulation of  garbage and lack of municipal services, noting that Baghdad  hospitals hae reported a noticeable increase in communicable  diseases.    The mayor urged health organisations the world over to act  swiftly for lifting the 45-month-old economic sanction imposed  on Iraq.     "

He added that Baghdad outskirts are still suffering from  lack  of potable water, noting that about one-third of Baghdad city  lacks waste-water treatment system due to the stoppage of work  on sewage and waste-water treatment projects due to lack of  spare parts and materials due to the sanctions.    Moreover, the work of waste collecting vehicles is hampered  by lack of maintenance and spare parts causing in consequence  heaps of garbage in residential quarters of Baghdad, noting that  the number of workers has also decreased from 6332 to some 2500  ones.    Solid waste disposal has been disrupted, consequently  causing  air pollution because people often tend to incinerate rubbish,  said the mayor.    Mr. Hassun added that the sanctions have also brought work  on  renovation project of Baghdad city of a standstill, noting that  work on the said project has started in 1980s. He added that  the project aims at renovating and refurbishing ancient and  historical sites and holy shrines and historical mosques and  churches.    Mr. Hassun warned of the spread of epidemics saying that  people of Baghdad city suffer from the wide spread of epidemics  resulting from environmental pollution, the accumulation of  garbage and lack of municipal services, noting that Baghdad  hospitals hae reported a noticeable increase in communicable  diseases.    The mayor urged health organisations the world over to act  swiftly for lifting the 45-month-old economic sanction imposed  on Iraq.     "

As troops and police hunted the soldier's killers, the gendarmerie command said its forces had arrested - for the first time - a preacher for using a mosque to 'incite citizens to revolt against institutions of the state'. The five-man collective presidency reminded Algerians it was responsible for preserving public order following the scrapping of the second round of the country's first multi-party general election which Moslem fundamentalists had been poised to win. 'The High Council of State ..solemnly reminds all those, individuals and organisations, authors, provocators and their accomplices, it will use all the state's means for strict and total application of the law,'' it said in a statement. The Islamic Salvation Front, which warns of an 'explosion', has reported more than 500 arrests since last Tuesday. It says those detained include members of its ruling council, the Majlis Echoura, and fundamentalists elected in first-round voting.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told journalists that the  request had been decided after the arrest Friday evening of  dissident Wang Fucheng, secretary-general of the Shanghai-based  Chinese Human Rights Association.    ""This is now rather a lot, and we are starting not to  appreciate it,"" Juppe said. ""We have asked for an explanation,  and we are awaiting a reply.""

By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Owners of bars and other liquor outlets who knowingly allow drug dealers to  operate on their premises could have their liquor licenses confiscated in as  little as 10 days under a law that takes effect next week, a state legislator  who authored the measure said Thursday.    Standing in front of a closed-up Boyle Heights lounge where there were frequent  arrests for drug use, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said the new law  dramatically shortens the period it takes for state and local officials to  seize a license.    Katz explained that under the current law, owners are allowed to fight the  confiscation process in court, which can take up to three years. Throughout  that time, he said, drug sales can continue.    ""There will be no more courtroom tricks"" to delay the seizing of liquor  licenses, said Katz, who was joined by community leaders who had helped push  the bill through the Legislature. ""Too many neighborhoods are suffering.""    The assemblyman said there has been a ""significant increase"" in the amount of  drugs being dealt out of bars, adding that in the first four months of 1989  there was a 240% increase in the number of liquor licenses the state has moved  to revoke because of drug sales.    Katz said the bar behind him was an example of how difficult it is for the  state to revoke a license under the current law.    Sought to Seize License    He said the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control attempted for two years to  confiscate the license of Estrellas De Noche, located in the 2400 block of East  1st Street, but the owners fought the revocation.    During the last year, he said, as many as 20 narcotics arrests were made at the  bar, including the bartender.    Before the dispute with the ABC could be settled, Katz said, the bar owners  voluntarily gave up their liquor license. The owners could not be reached for  comment.    The bar was closed only two weeks ago, according to Marcos Ramirez, 26, a  neighborhood resident who said that drug dealers used to hang out on the  sidewalk in front of the bar.    ""I think this is great,"" Ramirez said of the recent closure. ""All they did was  scare people around the neighborhood.""    Jay Stroh, the director of the ABC, complained that it has been ""very  difficult"" to act against a license-holder because of built-in delays in the  legal system. ""This will give us further tentacles to get out and remove these  problems,"" he said.    The law allows local district attorneys or the state attorney general to go to  Superior Court to seize a license of a bar owner, or a convenience store where  beer and wine is sold. A hearing is then required to be held within 10 days. At  the close of the hearing, the court can seize the license.    Katz said leaders from various community organizations helped fight the  so-called ""liquor lobby"" to get the bill passed.    But John Pierce, a staff attorney for the ABC, said the law would likely be  limited in its application because authorities must prove that the bar owner  knew about and consented to the drug sales.    ""This is a fairly limited situation,"" he said. He said that in most cases bar  owners say they had no idea illegal activity was occurring on their premises,  or outside in the parking lot.    ""We don't really know how the statute will work out,"" Pierce said. He estimated  that the new law might be used in 10% to 20% of the cases brought by the ABC.    But even that limited use is important to neighborhoods battling drug dealers  who duck into friendly business establishments when police drive by, according  to Katz and several community leaders.

The development fuelled market nervousness in Spain where attention is already centred on investigations of Mr Mario Conde, who was dismissed by the Bank of Spain as chairman of Banesto a year ago. Mr Conde was questioned for the second consecutive day yesterday over alleged fraud in connection with the collapse of Banesto. Judge Baltasar Garzon jailed Mr Julian Sancristobal, director general of state security between 1984 and 1986, in connection with the activities of a group called GAL, Anti-terrorist Liberation Group, that claimed 23 fatal victims in a shooting and bombing campaign against suspected ETA Basque separatists in south west France 10 years ago. Included in the indictment are the former head of the anti-terrorist unit in the Basque city of Bilbao, who was jailed along with Mr Sancristobal, who was arrested yesterday at Barcelona airport when he was allegedly trying to leave Spain.

Open Space (7.40 BBC2) shows a Cambridge Union debate on political correctness with British journalist Ann Leslie attacking and American feminist Andrea Dworkin defending. Today's Timewatch (8.10 BBC2) is unique: Kenneth Griffith, in telling the story of Roger Casement, argues the Irish nationalist case with passion. Normally television simply suppresses the argument. Dispatches (9.00 C4) suggests that the lifting of border controls within the EC may lead to a reduction in individual liberties - or anyway more mistaken arrests - as police attempt to compensate by exchanging, and storing on computers, increasing amounts of information. The programme shows how mistakes arising from this can lead to violent arrest and wrongful imprisonment. In Whicker's World (9.00) the globe-trtting chronicler of the rich finally meets the richest of the lot: the Sultan of Brunei. BBC2 shows the first in a three-part adaptation of Conrad's The Secret Agent (9.25). Michael Palin continues his journey from Pole To Pole through Russia, from St Petersburg to Odessa (9.30 BBC1).

The remarks by Mr Ibrahim Legwell were similar to numerous Libyan offers to surrender the suspects to neutral countries, but not to London or Washington, which have requested their extradition. Mandatory UN sanctions, including a ban on air travel to or from Libya, came into force on Wednesday after the regime headed by Col Muammer Gadaffi had refused to hand over the two men. Earlier, Mr Lagwell said the men would go to Scotland or the US if a fair trial was guaranteed. Libya has told various foreign diplomats to leave the country, in retaliation for a reduction in Libyan representation abroad demanded by other countries in accordance with the UN sanctions. Italy, Belgium, Brazil, Spain and Hungary were among the first countries affected. The cut in air links has forced passengers to travel overland to airports in Tunisia and Egypt.

The figures, published by New York city comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, include Dollars 360m in immediate short-term costs of repairing the buildings and business losses. The cost of the first week is estimated at Dollars 332m, with a cost of Dollars 90m for Monday and declining by about 10 per cent each day as businesses find alternative means of operating. This would bring cumulative costs to Dollars 887m if the World Trade Centre towers reopen by March 15. Ms Holtzman said the biggest economic impact appears to be in terms of lost business. Companies may attempt to recoup losses by making claims against the New York Port Authority 'but to the extent that such payments reduced the Port Authority's ability to invest in the region's transportation infrastructure, that would hurt the region'.

AFRICA;    APARTHEID: PRESIDENT DE KLERK MAKES A HISTORIC CONCESSION IN THE BLACK  MAJORITY'S STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM. THE MOVE IS HAILED AS GREATLY COURAGEOUS.      From Associated Press      CAPE TOWN, South Africa      President Frederik W. de Klerk legalized the African National Congress on  Friday and promised to free Nelson Mandela, a historic concession to the epic  struggle for freedom by the nation's black majority.    Thousands of blacks filled the streets of several cities to celebrate the  announcements by De Klerk in a speech that was widely hailed as courageous.    But black activists and several countries said that despite the move to  legalize the ANC and dozens of other anti-apartheid groups, the white-run  government must now follow through. De Klerk did not act dismantle the  foundation of the apartheid system that would give South Africa's 28 million  blacks a direct voice in running the country.    Activists, white businessmen, liberal politicians and foreign governments  praised the courage of De Klerk, who scrapped many other restrictions on  opposition activity in a bid to draw the ANC into negotiations on South  Africa's future.    ""It's incredible. What he said has certainly taken my breath away,"" said  Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his  opposition to apartheid. ""We could say that we are probably seeing history in  the making in South Africa.""    President Bush called the move ""quite positive"" and said he will review U.S.  sanctions on South Africa. An aide said De Klerk and Mandela will be invited to  the White House when the black leader is released.    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain described De Klerk's announcement  as ""a historic landmark,"" and lifted cultural and academic embargoes.    The exiled ANC said De Klerk's announcements ""go a long way to creating the  climate conducive to negotiations."" But the Zambia-based organization, which  has been fighting a guerrilla war almost 30 years, said more changes were  needed before talks could begin.    If the two sides begin negotiations, quick breakthroughs appear unlikely.    The ANC and all leading anti-apartheid groups demand a one-person, one-vote  democracy, which De Klerk opposes, saying it will result in the 28 million  blacks dominating the 5 million whites.    De Klerk, since taking office in August, has said he envisions some type of  system in which no single racial group would dominate.    Mandela, 71, the country's best-known black leader, would be freed shortly, De  Klerk said. But he said ""personal circumstances and safety"" were among the  factors delaying the release.    ""I want to put it plainly that the government has decided to release Nelson  Mandela unconditionally,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, a further short passage of  time is unavoidable.""    Tutu agreed with De Klerk's assessment, saying, ""There may be people, a lunatic  fringe, who would want to subvert the process by liquidating him. I think that  we have to accept that there are certain constraints.""    De Klerk said he would lift bans on more than 30 outlawed groups and scrap  restrictions on a similar number. He pledged to free most prisoners jailed for  belonging to these groups, declared a moratorium on executions, and lifted most  of the restrictions imposed during a 43-month-old state of emergency.    These were the principal steps demanded by Mandela and the ANC as conditions  for negotiations on a new constitution that would end the black majority's  exclusion from national politics.    ""The season of violence is over. The time for reconstruction and reconciliation  has arrived,"" De Klerk said in his speech, greeted with cheers from supporters  and silence from the right-wing opposition.    De Klerk said his Cabinet unanimously agreed on the decision and the action on  legalizing the groups requires no action from Parliament or any other branch of  government.    Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, challenged  de Klerk to call an immediate election for white voters to see whether they  backed his decisions.    ""We say he has no mandate for doing the drastic things he intends doing,""  Treurnicht said.    At the perimeter of the parliamentary buildings, about 5,000 demonstrators,  many chanting ""ANC! ANC!"" joined a march demanding Mandela's release.    In Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, the three largest cities, thousands of  blacks sang and danced in the streets to celebrate the ANC's legalization.    Police said marchers threw stones at them in Johannesburg and ordered the crowd  to disperse. They then fired tear gas. No arrests or serious injuries were  reported.    The groups to be legalized, in addition to the ANC, include the smaller  Pan-Africanist Congress guerrilla movement, the South African Communist Party  and the United Democratic Front, a nationwide multiracial anti-apartheid  coalition.    The United Democratic Front, which is aligned with the ANC, welcomed De Klerk's  changes but called for sanctions to remain in place.    ""To lift sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the process to  democracy,"" it said in a statement.    De Klerk said he was lifting restrictions imposed on 374 activists after their  release from detention.    He said state-of-emergency detentions would be limited to a maximum of six  months and emergency restrictions on the media would be scrapped except for  some unspecified controls over photographic and television coverage of unrest.    Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for  helping plan the start of the ANC's sabotage and bombing campaign. He has met  with De Klerk, other government officials and anti-apartheid leaders over the  last several months in talks aimed at clearing the way for negotiations.    The ANC was outlawed in 1960 after 48 years of nonviolent campaigning for black  rights. In 1961, it launched its sabotage campaign.    In the last year, the guerrilla campaign has subsided markedly. The ANC's  exiled leadership has acknowledged that its military options were limited and  that it favored negotiations if De Klerk was willing to allow unrestricted  black political activity.    ""The allegation has been that the government did not wish to talk to them (the  ANC and the Pan-Africanist Congress) and that they are deprived of their right  to normal political activity,"" De Klerk said.    ""The unconditional lifting of the prohibition . . . places everybody in a  position to pursue politics freely,"" he added. ""The justification for violence,  which was always advanced, no longer exists.""      DE KLERK'S PROPOSED REFORMS    Here are highlights of the concessions to the black majority made by President  F. W. de Klerk on Friday in a speech to Parliament:    * Legalization of the African National Congress, outlawed since 1960, and more  than 60 other banned and restricted organizations including the Pan-Africanist  Congress, the South African Communist Party, the United Democratic Front and  the Azanian People's Organization.    * Release in the near future of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners --  except those who have committed ordinary crimes.    * Moratorium on hangings, until the government rewrites the death-sentence law  to apply only to extreme cases. Death Row prisoners henceforth will have an  automatic right to appeal.    * Repeal of the Separate Amenities Act promised during the current session of  Parliament, ending the right of local authorities to segregate public  facilities by race.    * Lifting of emergency regulations regarding education and the press, except  the restrictions on photography and filming of political unrest.    * Ending emergency restrictions on freedom of speech, movement, assembly and  work that were imposed on 374 freed detainees, and the emergency regulations  which allowed such restrictions to be repealed.    * Retaining detention without trial, but limiting it to six months. Detainees  will have the right to legal representation and a doctor of their own choice.

""I want to put it plainly that the government has decided to release Nelson  Mandela unconditionally,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, a further short passage of  time is unavoidable.""    Tutu agreed with De Klerk's assessment, saying, ""There may be people, a lunatic  fringe, who would want to subvert the process by liquidating him. I think that  we have to accept that there are certain constraints.""    De Klerk said he would lift bans on more than 30 outlawed groups and scrap  restrictions on a similar number. He pledged to free most prisoners jailed for  belonging to these groups, declared a moratorium on executions, and lifted most  of the restrictions imposed during a 43-month-old state of emergency.    These were the principal steps demanded by Mandela and the ANC as conditions  for negotiations on a new constitution that would end the black majority's  exclusion from national politics.    ""The season of violence is over. The time for reconstruction and reconciliation  has arrived,"" De Klerk said in his speech, greeted with cheers from supporters  and silence from the right-wing opposition.    De Klerk said his Cabinet unanimously agreed on the decision and the action on  legalizing the groups requires no action from Parliament or any other branch of  government.    Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, challenged  de Klerk to call an immediate election for white voters to see whether they  backed his decisions.    ""We say he has no mandate for doing the drastic things he intends doing,""  Treurnicht said.    At the perimeter of the parliamentary buildings, about 5,000 demonstrators,  many chanting ""ANC! ANC!"" joined a march demanding Mandela's release.    In Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, the three largest cities, thousands of  blacks sang and danced in the streets to celebrate the ANC's legalization.    Police said marchers threw stones at them in Johannesburg and ordered the crowd  to disperse. They then fired tear gas. No arrests or serious injuries were  reported.    The groups to be legalized, in addition to the ANC, include the smaller  Pan-Africanist Congress guerrilla movement, the South African Communist Party  and the United Democratic Front, a nationwide multiracial anti-apartheid  coalition.    The United Democratic Front, which is aligned with the ANC, welcomed De Klerk's  changes but called for sanctions to remain in place.    ""To lift sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the process to  democracy,"" it said in a statement.    De Klerk said he was lifting restrictions imposed on 374 activists after their  release from detention.    He said state-of-emergency detentions would be limited to a maximum of six  months and emergency restrictions on the media would be scrapped except for  some unspecified controls over photographic and television coverage of unrest.    Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for  helping plan the start of the ANC's sabotage and bombing campaign. He has met  with De Klerk, other government officials and anti-apartheid leaders over the  last several months in talks aimed at clearing the way for negotiations.    The ANC was outlawed in 1960 after 48 years of nonviolent campaigning for black  rights. In 1961, it launched its sabotage campaign.    In the last year, the guerrilla campaign has subsided markedly. The ANC's  exiled leadership has acknowledged that its military options were limited and  that it favored negotiations if De Klerk was willing to allow unrestricted  black political activity.    ""The allegation has been that the government did not wish to talk to them (the  ANC and the Pan-Africanist Congress) and that they are deprived of their right  to normal political activity,"" De Klerk said.    ""The unconditional lifting of the prohibition . . . places everybody in a  position to pursue politics freely,"" he added. ""The justification for violence,  which was always advanced, no longer exists.""      DE KLERK'S PROPOSED REFORMS    Here are highlights of the concessions to the black majority made by President  F. W. de Klerk on Friday in a speech to Parliament:    * Legalization of the African National Congress, outlawed since 1960, and more  than 60 other banned and restricted organizations including the Pan-Africanist  Congress, the South African Communist Party, the United Democratic Front and  the Azanian People's Organization.    * Release in the near future of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners --  except those who have committed ordinary crimes.    * Moratorium on hangings, until the government rewrites the death-sentence law  to apply only to extreme cases. Death Row prisoners henceforth will have an  automatic right to appeal.    * Repeal of the Separate Amenities Act promised during the current session of  Parliament, ending the right of local authorities to segregate public  facilities by race.    * Lifting of emergency regulations regarding education and the press, except  the restrictions on photography and filming of political unrest.    * Ending emergency restrictions on freedom of speech, movement, assembly and  work that were imposed on 374 freed detainees, and the emergency regulations  which allowed such restrictions to be repealed.    * Retaining detention without trial, but limiting it to six months. Detainees  will have the right to legal representation and a doctor of their own choice.

Government spokesman Dieter Vogel told a news briefing here  that the peace process cannot be broken off.    He said the four planes, identified as Bosnian Serb but  denied by them, clearly violated the UN Security Council  resolution banning flights over the war-torn area in Bosnia.    NATO said the aircraft were Bosnian Serb planes and had  carried out a bombing raid on Muslim-held territory.    Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SDP), while condoning  the attack, nevertheless described it as a serious incident.    ""Military action is always accompanied by the danger of it  escalating,"" the SDP leadership said in a statement. It hoped  the incident would clear the way for a political solution to the  Bosnian conflict.    Germany has joined other NATO countries in enforcing the  Bosnian no-fly zone, but its participation is limited to the use  of its airmen on AWACS planes.     "

Iran's chief prosecutor, Ayatollah Abolfazl Musavi Tabrizi,  said authorities had arrested Mojahedin members ""sent from Iraq  with the aim of carrying out sabotage activities.""    A Mojahedin spokesman ""described these lies as part of the  regime's stage-managed ploys to attribute the massacre of the  worshippers of Imam Reza's Shrine to the Mojahedin,"" according  to a statement faxed to AFP in Nicosia.    A bomb explosion in the northeastern city of Mashhad Monday  [20 June] left 25 people dead and 70 wounded, Iran's interior  ministry said.    Tabrizi did not say how many were arrested or if they were  linked to the bombing.    The Iranian authorities have repeatedly blamed the  Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization for cross-border attacks and  bombing incidents inside the country, including Monday's  explosion.

MONTALBANO, Times Staff Writer      ATHENS      From his prison cell, Palestinian Mohammed Rashid is emerging as a key  international symbol of American resolve -- and Greek ambivalence -- in the  fight against terrorism.    Rashid, a tall and spare 39-year-old, says he is a freedom fighter, but the  United States says he is an airplane bomber. It wants to make him the first  alleged international terrorist successfully extradited to face American  justice.    The Greek Supreme Court is deciding whether to ratify a lower court decision  granting the U.S. extradition request. Diplomatic sources and Athens newspapers  speculate that the decision will come later this month.    Accused by the United States of planting the in-flight bomb that killed a  Japanese teen-ager and wounded 15 other passengers on a Pan Am 747 flying from  Tokyo to Honolulu in 1982, Rashid was arrested last May when he sought to enter  Greece on a forged Syrian passport.      U.S. Tip Cited    An intelligence tip from the United States led to his arrest, but resolution of  his case implies a collision of opposites: the Reagan Administration pursuing  terrorists wherever it can find them versus the government of Socialist Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou seeking conciliation with Greece's Arab neighbors.    The United States and Greece's Western allies say Papandreou is soft on  terrorism, preferring to see no evil than to vigorously pursue terrorist groups  that have used Greece as a base.    ""The Greek government's anti-terrorism policy appears to be one of complete  surrender. The security of every citizen in the world is jeopardized by its  unconscionable conduct,"" charged nine U.S. congressmen in a resolution  submitted to the House last week that calls for Rashid's prompt extradition.      Denies Accusations    The Papandreou government denies accusations that it has a gentlemen's  agreement allowing safe harbor in Greece for Palestinian extremists in exchange  for their promise not to commit acts of violence in Greece or against Greek  targets.    At a court hearing in July, Rashid denied any role in the 1982 bombing. ""The  Americans say what they like,"" he asserted. ""I had nothing to do with it."" He  said he is a member of the Palestine Liberation Army, a wing of Yasser Arafat's  Palestine Liberation Organization. ""I was passing through Greece on a secret  mission,"" he told the court.    U.S. investigators believe Rashid, who was jailed in Greece from 1973 to 1976  for possession of hashish, is a senior member of an extremist Palestinian  terrorist group called May 15. The group has been named as one of the suspects  in last month's bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland.    Greece is at pains to maintain good ties with Arab neighbors to whom it is  linked by history and geography as well as by ideology and economics. Arab  states are among Greece's strongest supporters in its simmering dispute with  Turkey over Cyprus. The government said last week that it could not intervene  in the Rashid affair since it was before the courts, but domestic opponents say  that under Papandreou, the line between politics and the law has not always  been clear.    In a surprise decision in mid-December that most observers ascribe to  Papandreou personally, Greece reneged on an agreement to extradite Palestinian  terrorist suspect Abdel Osama Zomar to Italy, deporting him instead to a  welcoming Libya.    Italian police say Zomar, now 27, helped to plan an attack on Rome's main  synagogue, in which a 2-year-old boy died and about three dozen worshipers were  wounded in October, 1982. The next month, Zomar, who is linked to  Libya-supported Palestinian extremist Abu Nidal, was caught driving a car  loaded with explosives near the Greek border with Turkey. In 1984, the Supreme  Court approved Zomar's extradition to Italy at the end of his sentence.    When the time for extradition arrived last month, Justice Minister Vassilis  Rotis, a newcomer to the Greek government with no great personal clout,  concluded that in bombing the synagogue, Zomar had been ""acting in the struggle  for the re-acquisition of his homeland.""

The arrests came as the contractors were handing over  considerable sums of money, presumably intended--according to  the accusation that led to criminal charges--as payment of  bribes to administrative officials in the system for the  privilege of being service providers and getting patients.    It is public knowledge that Councilman Anibal Ibarra of the  capital was able to witness the handoff and then made the  accusation before the judge. Though the judge does not yet think  he has solid grounds to order the prosecution of the suspects,  he has in his hands a case that should be pursued until no stone  is left unturned.    More or less vague and sweeping insinuations and suspicions  are commonplace when it comes to the funds managed by various  public agencies, and the existence of widespread administrative  corruption in government is, unfortunately, a fact of life in  Argentine society that is as unprovable as it is irremediable.  To be sure, there are few opportunities to record a concrete,  verifiable incident in the presence of a judge, and this is  probably what has made the PAMI case so special.    But even if the fact were irrefutably proven and a trial  were  to be conducted, that would say nothing about the true nature of  these payments, their ultimate destination, or the goods and  services received or to be received in exchange for them. That,  precisely, is what the courts must clear up and what public  opinion must discover. The public has viewed this case as the  key that will unlock the door to finally expose the corruption  and punish the perpetrators of the crimes that have been  committed.    In this regard, the episode appears to have been unduly  publicized because of the upcoming elections, even though it is  of such singular importance that it should be protected from  political grandstanding and be handled according to strict  judicial guidelines.    No matter what the investigation reveals, however, the  leadership of the agency involved bears some responsibility,  whether it is proven that they were directly involved in the  incident or that there were administrative shortcomings or lax  controls. Furthermore, some serious ethical questions come to  mind, since what is at stake are the funds that the community  has allocated for meeting the needs of its weakest members,  those who generally are most in need of medical care. No matter  who is lining his pockets and stealing some of the funds that  the workers and their employers have contributed to the PAMI, no  matter what mechanism is used, substantial harm is being done to  the system, and of course, to those who turn to it when they  need assistance.    After the initial accusation was made, implicating providers  of psychiatric services and prompting a judicial investigation,  other allegations were made against various entities for  overcharging, billing for services that were never rendered,  paying bribes, etc. Now the charges involve geriatric and dental  facilities and clinics and sanatoriums all over the country, and  they must be investigated as well. The situation has gotten even  more complicated with Ibarra's new claim that he has been  subjected to threats and a bribery attempt.    The PAMI budget is more than 2 billion pesos a year, which  can give rise to a lot of temptations. It is imperative that the  judicial investigation be carried out to the fullest extent,  without political interference of any sort, to shed light on the  medical and administrative management of cases, the use of  resources, and the mechanisms for contracting services for  retirees. And not just for the sake of efficiency and honesty,  but also because we have a moral obligation to the elderly, to  whom society is still indebted.     "

The clash has pitted the Valley Cab Co., holder of an exclusive Los Angeles  taxi service franchise for the Valley, against Super Car Service, a small,  upstart company that holds a charter car service permit from the state.    Valley Cab officials have accused Super Car of illegally operating a taxi  service and stealing their business. Super Car officials counter that they  stick to their charter business, following rules that bar them from cruising  streets, cabstands or hotels.    It is a tempest in a taxicab that brewed for six months before finally spilling  into police stations and the courts this month.    Though the dispute focuses on the finer points of what a charter service permit  allows, it clearly has not been just a war of words. Two weeks ago a group of  Valley Cab drivers and an off-duty police officer carried out an unofficial  sting operation, handcuffing and arresting seven Super Car drivers for  allegedly operating ""bandit,"" or illegal, taxicabs in the Valley.      Declined to Prosecute    The city attorney's office declined to prosecute the citizen arrests, and the  city's Department of Transportation has said it has no authority to investigate  complaints about Super Car Service because that is the state's responsibility.    And on Thursday, a judge let lapse a preliminary injunction that barred Super  Car from acting as a taxi service. The Superior Court injunction had been  issued Dec. 30, and a hearing will determine later whether Super Car has been  improperly operating a cab service.    Meanwhile, state officials said they had not been asked to look into the flap  and, because of sparse staffing, they would need a written complaint before  acting.    Undeterred, Valley Cab officials said the war will continue.    ""We are not going to stop going after violators,"" said George Piadra, a general  manager for Valley Cab. ""They are illegally taking our business away. We are  going to do something about it. The city isn't doing anything, so we will.""    Ivik Sarkisian, president of Super Car, vehemently disagrees and attributes the  friction to David-and-Goliath-type clashes between a new, fledgling business  and an entrenched giant.    ""That's all baloney,"" Sarkisian said of Valley Cab's accusations. ""They have a  monopoly in the Valley, and they don't want any competition. We are operating  legally.""    The cab squabble began eight months ago when the North Hollywood-based Super  Car Service opened for business with a fleet of nine cars. Sarkisian has a  permit from the state Public Utilities Commission that allows him to operate  the charter car service.    The permit does not allow its holder to run a regular cab service, said Mike  Nakasone, a utilities commission enforcement officer. But it does permit Super  Car to offer a service in which rides are reserved in advance -- usually by  phone -- and costs are computed per mile.    A charter car cannot have a fare meter or a taxi dome light, and it cannot wait  for riders at cabstands or pick up customers who flag it down on the street,  Nakasone said.      Noticed Competition    Shortly after Super Car opened, Valley Cab drivers began to notice they had  competition, said Tom Hefferan, another general manager for the Van Nuys-based  fleet of 71 taxis.    Valley Cab has been the only taxi service licensed by the city to do business  in the Valley since 1981. It is one of eight firms the city has licensed to  operate in different parts of Los Angeles.    The companies pay about $64 a month per cab for the right to cruise for fares  in their assigned sections of the city. While each company can respond to phone  requests from anywhere in the city, they are not allowed to advertise outside  of their assigned areas.    The city has licensed taxis since 1915, said David Leatherman, an engineer in  the Department of Transportation's regulation and enforcement division. The  arrangement allows the city to regulate safety, insurance and service standards  of taxis and ensures that the companies can make a profit.    City transportation department officials said they are considering revamping  the franchising system when the taxi companies' permits expire in July. The new  plan includes a proposal to allow a second company to operate in the Valley.    ""We've had resistance from Valley Cab, but we've had resistance from everybody  when that happens,"" Leatherman said. ""We think the market's there, the need's  there.""    John E. de Brauwere, Super Car's attorney, said the clash has developed because  a company licensed by a different government -- in this case, the state -- to  provide car service has entered the Valley to compete with the city's license  holder for taxi service.    ""It's a strange case,"" de Brauwere said. ""I can understand why Valley Cab has  gotten its nose out of joint. But both companies have a right to operate.""    Valley Cab officials disagree. Shortly after noticing Super Car was in  business, they started watching the smaller company closely.    Off-duty Valley Cab drivers called for rides from Super Car and kept notes on  how the company operated. They clipped Super Car advertisements in the  ""taxicabs"" section of the local Yellow Pages. They photographed Super Car  automobiles, which are painted school-bus yellow with orange stripes.    ""Somebody would have to tell you it wasn't a cab for you to know,"" Hefferan  said.      Accused of 'Guzzling'    Worst of all, Hefferan claimed, Valley Cab drivers have watched Super Car  drivers ""guzzling"" riders -- cabbie parlance for listening in on a competitor's  dispatch radio frequency and then beating the driver to a pick-up spot to snare  the unsuspecting rider. Super Car officials denied this.    Hefferan said that after Valley Cab put together what he believes is solid  evidence of Super Car's wrongdoing, the company informed the city Department of  Transportation's bandit cab unit, which is charged with getting unlicensed cabs  off the streets.    Operating without a taxi license is a misdemeanor, with a penalty of up to six  months in jail and a $1,000 fine. There are as many as 600 bandit cabs in the  city in addition to 1,150 licensed cabs, according to Los Angeles Department of  Transportation estimates.    Bobbie L. Walker, head of the city's bandit unit, said he began an  investigation of Super Car but ended it without taking action against the  company. He said city transportation officials decided that because Super Car  operates through a state Public Utilities Commission permit, the company fell  under the jurisdiction of state investigators.    ""The city can't investigate them for violations of state regulations. The state  has to determine that,"" Walker said. ""We can only enforce the rules on cars  that we license"" or that have no license or permit at all.    ""The consensus was that any arrests we would make would be no good because if  any laws were broken they would be state laws,"" Walker said. ""In my opinion,  they are using the state permit to get around the city's license.""    Valley Cab next took its case to Van Nuys Superior Court. On Dec. 30, Judge  David R. Nisall granted a preliminary injunction ordering Super Car to stop  operating a taxi service. He ordered the company not to advertise or solicit  taxi service in the Valley or to try to ""pass off"" any of its vehicles as  licensed cabs.    But Valley Cab's victory was short-lived. The ruling did not eliminate its  problem, it only set the stage for the company to take matters into its own  hands.    Hefferan said Super Car ignored the order. Sarkisian said his company had no  choice because the judge ordered Super Car to stop doing something that it had  not been doing.    ""We never were acting as a cab service in the first place,"" Sarkisian said. ""We  have stayed within the state PUC codes. I am not supposed to have the lights on  top of my cars or the meters. I don't. We are not supposed to pick up flag-down  fares. We don't. Anyway you look at it, I am not a taxi service.""    But Valley Cab representatives said they are unswayed by such subtle  distinctions.    ""If it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck and eats like a duck, then it's a  duck,"" said Valley Cab attorney Steven M. Neimand. ""They are trying to fall  through a crack and say as long as we don't have a meter and top light, we can  operate.""    Frustrated by their unsuccessful effort to get Super Car off the road, Valley  Cab officials hired off-duty Glendale police officer Ronald Jenkins and planned  their sting operation.    By Jan. 7, they were ready to strike. Hefferan and a Valley Cab driver called  Super Car from a phone booth in Van Nuys and arranged for a ride while Jenkins  waited at another location.    What happened next is a matter of opinion and dispute. Valley Cab officials  charged that by answering the call and providing a ride to the two men, Super  Car was operating as a taxi service in violation of city law.    Super Car officials said they were simply operating in accordance with their  state permit.      Waiting With Handcuffs    Regardless, when the Super Car vehicle took the two riders to their  destination, Jenkins, who had been on unpaid administrative leave from the  Glendale Police Department since August, 1987, was waiting with handcuffs. He  told the driver he was under arrest, read him his legal rights, cuffed him and  hauled him to the Van Nuys police station.    Police processed the paper work, and the driver was released on his own  recognizance. The Valley Cab team made six more citizen arrests of Super Car  drivers over the next three days.    Officer Don Lawrence called the arrests ""a little unusual. Normally, citizens  will report a crime. But it's not regular that citizens will actually bring in  a suspect.""    And while the use of handcuffs may have seemed excessive, it may not have been  improper, Lawrence added. Citizens can use ""reasonable force necessary to hold  the suspect,"" he said.    Jenkins, who has accused the Glendale Police Department of discriminating  against him because he is black, has been on leave awaiting a ruling on his  claims that he has suffered severe emotional distress because of the  harassment.    Super Car officials said the arrests were uncalled for, the dispute has cost  them business, and they are considering filing a lawsuit against Valley Cab in  retaliation.    ""They are really bad-mouthing Super Car,"" de Brauwere said. ""We have noticed a  tremendous decline in patronage.""    The unofficial sting operation came to a screeching halt when police refused to  take the Super Car drivers after the sixth and seventh citizen arrests.    The city attorney's office declined to file charges against the Super Car  drivers because of insufficient evidence gathered by Valley Cab, said Martin  Vranicar, supervising deputy in the city attorney's Van Nuys office.    ""They don't meet the filing guidelines for bandit taxi cab operations,""  Vranicar said of the seven cases. ""These cases were done by private individuals  and not by professionals. We do not encourage private citizens to investigate  crimes because of the possibility of violence, danger, not knowing whether it's  really a crime and not understanding what evidence is necessary.""    Hefferan expressed disappointment in the city's stance.    ""It's not fair. It's very frustrating,"" he said. ""The city doesn't pay enough  attention to it. They should be protecting the companies they franchise.""      Injunction Expires    Valley Cab suffered another setback on Thursday when Associate Court of Appeal  Judge Richard Amerian, sitting in Superior Court, continued until Feb. 3 a  hearing on the company's request for a permanent injunction against Super Car.  In doing so, he allowed a preliminary injunction against Super Car to expire.    With no court order stopping Super Car from operating and the city staying out  of the dispute, the Public Utilities Commission, the agency that gave Super Car  its permit, may be Valley Cab's last resort. Late last week, Valley Cab  officials indicated they may soon file a request with the commission to  investigate the matter.    Super Car attorney de Brauwere agreed that state officials ultimately may hold  the key to peace in the dispute. He said state legislators someday may have to  consider changing utilities commission codes to better define the role of  charter services.    ""They should all get their heads together and decide the exact parameters of  how a charter party service can operate,"" he said.      Photo, Valley Cab Co.

Legally an arrest warrant is no proof of guilt. But in this  particular case such a warrant will indicate that the judiciary  is virtually convinced of Ja'ja''s involvement in the bombing of  Sayyidat al-Najat Church.    The fact that no warrant has been served on Ja'Ja' yet, the  sources say, does not mean that his name did not come up during  the investigations or that there are no grounds for indicting  him.    The reason that no such warrant has been issued, the sources  add, is because of the technical and security peculiarities of  the case, as well as certain political and psychological  considerations.    While mere suspicion would normally suffice for serving  arrest warrants, both the judiciary and the Lebanese state are  hesitant to issue such a warrant in this case without backing it  with conclusive evidence, according to the same sources.

At the Tustin clinic, pro-choice ""clinic defenders"" were able to link arms to  prevent O.R. from gaining control of the door. I saw O.R. attempt to use ""human  battering rams,"" i.e. groups of protesters (mostly large men) to slam through  the pro-choice gauntlet (mostly women). I witnessed incidents of kicking,  shoving, using keys to gouge, all perpetrated by these ""nonviolent"" terrorists.  At one point, as a female staff member was trying to enter the clinic, her  fingernails were broken and her I.D. badges and clothing were torn.    I applaud the police in their use of methods to arrest these self-righteous  lawbreakers. They are fully warned via a dispersal notice before arrests begin,  and if they refuse to obey and go quietly, then they get what they deserve.

Plans for the 'Camerawatch' scheme were drawn up by the City of London police following the April 1992 St Mary Axe bombing by the IRA and were reinforced by the Bishopsgate bomb last April. Police believe the network of television systems has the potential to improve security in the City dramatically. Organisations with cameras are being approached to discover the extent of their coverage and their efficiency. Information already gathered shows some public areas which could usefully be covered and others where the system could be improved. Companies will be encouraged to switch their cameras to continuous monitoring of public places. They will be asked to bring the efficiency of the systems into line with recommendations being developed by the Home Office. City of London police commissioner Owen Kelly, who will formally announce the scheme today, said the knowledge that television systems were operating would deter terrorist and other criminal activity, and would provide the means of detection and evidence should offences occur.

The success which the police and the retailers are enjoying in combating shop crime is not helped if the euphemism 'shoplifter' continues to be used. We are not talking about a naughty schoolboy nicking a packet of sweets for a lark, although that itself often leads to worse crime and a belief that it is fair game. What is under discussion is wholesale and often violent theft by groups of people stealing to order and costing the honest customer money in the long run. Someone who steals from a bank is not called a banklifter, he is called a thief or worse. What we are combating is professional shop theft and we should all start saying so.

Police Chief Nicholas Pastore is trading in his force of drug-busting,  doughnut-eating militiamen for what he calls social engineers.    The new chief has banned leather driving gloves on police officers as too  intimidating and has told the members of his force to steer drug users to  treatment programs instead of jails.    He has also told his officers to knock off the frequent coffee-and-doughnut  runs during their breaks because it gives them a bad image with the public.    ""I want the police to be perceived as a helping-hand agency,"" said Pastore, who  has been on the job for seven months.    That perception can be bolstered if officers, among other things, help drug  users rather than just arrest them, the new chief said.    ""We've tried the tanks, the helicopters, the big guns for many years. It  doesn't work,"" Pastore, 52, said in a recent interview. ""I don't subscribe to  the philosophy that the more arrests you make, it's going to solve the crime  problem.""    Arrests in New Haven, a city of 125,000 people, dropped sharply when Pastore  discontinued sting operations to round up drug buyers. He has also stopped  dispatching teams of officers into high-crime neighborhoods for round-the-clock  arrests and disbanded the department's canine unit.    Instead, he ordered about 20 more officers to walk beats, placed officers at  high-visibility posts throughout downtown and made extensive community outreach  efforts to end what he calls the ""we-they mentality"" in drug-infested  neighborhoods.    He also walks the streets of crime-plagued neighborhoods himself, frequently  striking up conversations with known drug dealers.    ""When I'm seen in these neighborhoods, people realize this man cares,"" he said.    His actions have brought praise from various members of the public and business  community, but have put him at odds with the police department's union.    A group of downtown merchants recently presented Pastore with a plaque for his  efforts to increase police visibility. But Sgt. Louis G. Cavalier, the head of  the police officers union, complained that the stepped-up presence has merely  provided the community with a ""false sense of security.""    Pastore has also won the confidence of at least one drug user's mother, who  called him recently to say she needed to talk to someone she could trust.    The chief believes marijuana use should be decriminalized, and he said his  efforts to encourage addicts to seek treatment reflects his belief that the  drug problem should be resolved by physicians, not lawyers.    Such views earned him a prominent profile in the August issue of ""High Times,""  a magazine devoted to marijuana smoking.    Pastore said he didn't know the free-lance writer who spoke with him was doing  the interview for High Times. But he added that he was accurately quoted and  had no problems with the story.    His comments in a newspaper interview that there would be fewer  coffee-and-doughnut runs now that he was police chief ruffled some feathers in  the department. Union officials accuse him of frequently entering restaurants  and asking officers what they are doing.    ""There is the sense that the chief is on their backs constantly,"" Cavalier  said.    Pastore said he recalls only one such restaurant incident. He added that his  doughnut policy is not an attack on his officers' work ethic but on the  traditional concept of police work.    ""Police work should not be just doing what the dispatcher says, then in between  going to Dunkin' Donuts,"" he said.    He praises his officers, but dismisses the union's criticism.    ""The union doesn't care about the public,"" he said. ""All they care about is  what's good for them. ""They have become a group of militant mercenaries.""

Several people, including Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's Social Democratic mayor, were injured in the campaign which was aimed against human rights activists and politicians sympathetic to the plight of immigrants. Two men, both with connections to an illegal Austrian neo-Nazi organisation, were arrested last Thursday, and since then investigations have focused on the shadowy world of neo-Nazi groups in Austria and Germany. The German police are co-operating closely with the Austrian police in the search for possible German neo-Nazi links in the bombing campaign. Nothing is known of the latest suspects as the authorities are maintaining a news blackout on their investigations. Until now, Austria had been relatively free of the racist violence seen elsewhere in Europe. Many Austrians have grown increasingly concerned at the large influx of immigrants since the collapse of the communism in eastern and central Europe and the onset of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, but the letter-bomb campaign shocked a public unused to political violence and brought widespread sympathy for the victims.

State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Soviet warplanes, based both in  Afghanistan and across the border in the Soviet Union, are bombing targets  ""around the cities of Kandahar, Jalalabad and Kunduz."" He said there are no  Soviet troops still garrisoned around any of the three cities, so the attacks  are not required for the safe evacuation of Soviet armed forces.    ""This is a clear violation of Soviet assurances to us not to engage in  offensive operations during the withdrawal,"" Redman said. ""This daily  bombardment is unacceptable.""    Under the Geneva accords signed last year, the Soviet Union is required to  complete the withdrawal of its forces by Feb. 15.      Urges Americans to Leave    Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater urged all Americans,  except employees of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, to leave Afghanistan because of  the deteriorating security situation in the country.    Moscow radio said the Islamic guerrillas seeking to topple the Soviet-backed  government in Kabul have blocked the main road between the Afghan capital and  the Soviet border, requiring a Soviet airlift to provide food and other needed  supplies to the city.    Kabul is suffering severe food and fuel shortages, news agencies reported.  Diplomats in the Afghan capital were quoted as saying people must wait in line  for hours for bread and cooking fuel.    ""Because of fierce fighting with the extremists in the Salang Pass area, the  country's main highway linking Kabul with . . . the Soviet border is once again  paralyzed,"" Moscow Radio reported. ""The armed opposition is preventing the  normal supply of foodstuffs to the city.""    Redman said, however, that the rebels, known as the moujahedeen, have stopped  attacking the withdrawing Soviet forces, apparently to eliminate any excuse for  Moscow to delay its withdrawal.    ""The moujahedeen have been exercising restraint in permitting unhampered Soviet  withdrawal from Afghanistan,"" Redman said.

State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Soviet warplanes, based both in  Afghanistan and across the border in the Soviet Union, are bombing targets  ""around the cities of Kandahar, Jalalabad and Kunduz."" He said there are no  Soviet troops still garrisoned around any of the three cities, so the attacks  are not required for the safe evacuation of Soviet armed forces.    ""This is a clear violation of Soviet assurances to us not to engage in  offensive operations during the withdrawal,"" Redman said. ""This daily  bombardment is unacceptable.""    Under the Geneva accords signed last year, the Soviet Union is required to  complete the withdrawal of its forces by Feb. 15.      Urges Americans to Leave    Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater urged all Americans,  except employees of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, to leave Afghanistan because of  the deteriorating security situation in the country.    Moscow radio said the Islamic guerrillas seeking to topple the Soviet-backed  government in Kabul have blocked the main road between the Afghan capital and  the Soviet border, requiring a Soviet airlift to provide food and other needed  supplies to the city.    Kabul is suffering severe food and fuel shortages, news agencies reported.  Diplomats in the Afghan capital were quoted as saying people must wait in line  for hours for bread and cooking fuel.    ""Because of fierce fighting with the extremists in the Salang Pass area, the  country's main highway linking Kabul with . . . the Soviet border is once again  paralyzed,"" Moscow Radio reported. ""The armed opposition is preventing the  normal supply of foodstuffs to the city.""    Redman said, however, that the rebels, known as the moujahedeen, have stopped  attacking the withdrawing Soviet forces, apparently to eliminate any excuse for  Moscow to delay its withdrawal.    ""The moujahedeen have been exercising restraint in permitting unhampered Soviet  withdrawal from Afghanistan,"" Redman said.

0,FT932-10149 ,"FT932-10149 _AN-DEKCSAA5FT 930511   FT  11 MAY 93 / Fiat board meets to take ethics into account: A company scarred by Italy's widening corruption scandal      By HAIG SIMONIAN   THE meeting today of the board of directors of Fiat, Italy's biggest private company, will be a more sombre occasion than that originally called to approve last year's accounts. The gathering has been overtaken by Italy's widening political corruption scandal, in which Fiat has been pitched into the front line. Almost a dozen executives have been arrested, interrogated or briefly detained by magistrates investigating alleged kickbacks on public-sector contracts or bribes to politicians or political parties. The board has been summoned to approve a new code of business ethics, drawn up by lawyers. Incorporating an existing document on internal issues, such as conflicts of interest and insider trading, the code, modelled on similar practice at IBM and General Electric, will guide Fiat managers when dealing with bribery and corruption. The magistrates' inquiries have moved steadily up the group's management ladder to embrace, most recently, two of its three top executives, excluding members of the controlling Agnelli family. Earlier this year, Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, spent 28 days in Milan's San Vittore prison before being transferred to house arrest. Last month, magistrates issued a cautionary warrant against Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, its chief operating officer. Mr Garuzzo was placed under house arrest. Other executives arrested or questioned by magistrates include Mr Antonio Mosconi, managing director of Fiat's Toro insurance company, Mr Riccardo Ruggeri, managing director of its New Holland farm and earth-moving equipment business and Mr Paolo Torricelli, head of the Fiat Avio gas turbines subsidiary. The last two are back at work. The arrests reflect the main strands uncovered so far in the investigations. Mr Garuzzo and Mr Ruggeri were formerly chief executive and head of the bus division of Fiat's Iveco commercial vehicles subsidiary respectively. Iveco has been implicated in alleged kickbacks on bus sales to Milan. Mr Massimo Aimetti, Iveco's finance director, is also under house arrest in Turin. Construction is the second sector in which Fiat has been implicated. Apart from Mr Mattioli, chairman of the group's Cogefar-Impresit building unit, other executives interrogated include Mr Mosconi, who was managing director of the Fiat-Impresit building unit, and Mr Enzo Papi, a former senior manager in the group. Fiat has also been embroiled in allegations of kickbacks on contracts from Enel, the state electricity generating authority. The allegations have resulted in the issue of cautionary warrants against Mr Torricelli, now back at work, and Mr Mauro Bertini, head of Fiat Avio's gas turbines division, who is under house arrest. The group has also been investigated for alleged kickbacks paid by its Savigliano railway equipment division. The inquiries resulted in the brief incarceration of its head, Mr Giancarlo Cozza, now back at work. The string of arrests, most of them in the past two months, triggered Fiat's more co-operative approach towards the investigations. Last month, its lawyers contacted Milan magistrates, proposing that Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive, should volunteer to answer questions. Though the magistrates denied they had done a deal with Fiat, the company's initiative has led to a temporary halt in arrests and a relatively soft reception for executives to whom cautionary warrants have been issued and who have returned from abroad. So far, Mr Romiti has appeared twice before the magistrates. On the last occasion, he delivered a 20-page document, and six pages of appendices, outlining political corruption. Other Fiat managers have since supplied information. Mr Romiti also used the occasion to exhort other businessmen to adopt a similar approach. The change of heart has visibly eased tension between magistrates and the company. It has also lifted the mood within Fiat itself. However, last weekend, matters took a potential turn for the worse. In one of the press leaks endemic in the investigations, Panorama, a weekly news magazine, published extracts from Mr Mosconi's testimony. The report alleges that Mr Romiti knew of the existence of foreign bank accounts in the mid-1980s, long before previously indicated.   Companies:-  Fiat.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.

The embassy will open in the next few months but Libya has  already named Muhammad al-Fayturi as its charge d'affaires in  the Emirates.    The foreign ministry acting undersecretary, Sayf Sa'id, met  al- Fayturi on Tuesday ""after Libya decided to reopen its  diplomatic mission here,"" the official UAE news agency WAM said.    Libya closed its embassy in the UAE and several other  countries in the mid-1980s apparently because it wanted to cut  overspending due to a decline in oil prices, an Arab diplomat  said.    It was not clear what prompted the latest move since oil  prices have stayed weak. But the decision coincides with  Libya's dispute with the West over the 1988 Lockerbie plane  bombing.    The Gulf states -- oil producers like Libya -- have good  ties  with Washington and London, which demand the hand-over of two  Libyan suspects in the bombing over the Scottish village of  Lockerbie that cost 270 lives.

Detained suspects have  confessed that they were instructed by Israeli Mosad officers.  The conspiracy is large and serious. It has claimed many  lives, and might have claimed the lives of many schoolboys. It  targets the Lebanese entity, the Lebanese accord, and Lebanese  independence. The Government of Lebanon dissolved the Lebanese  Forces Party after it convicted several of its prominent members  of involvement in the Mosad's plan.    Blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, which brought death  and injury to many people, followed the Israeli massacre at the  holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Israel believed it could hit two birds  with one stone: Covering up the brutal Hebron massacre and  destroying the large strides Lebanon has taken on the road to  national accord. In the person of the Mosad, Israel planted  several time bombs at schools and public places -- bombs that  would have killed many people, if not for the efforts of the  Lebanese forces that defused them. The Israelis planned for the  bombing conspiracy to increase internal tension to an explosive  point, allowing the Mosad to exploit the sectarian issue.    As a result, the Lebanese soon found themselves on the brink  of a new civil war, the national accord was dissolving, and the  sound of treacherous gunfire was again heard. Israel wants to  avenge Lebanon and the Lebanese because they have stopped their  infighting, restored the Lebanese motherland and its genuine  traditions of love and coexistence, and got down to work to  build their country and restore its vital role in the Arab and  international communities, in full coordination with Syria.    In fact, Israel's daily brutal aggressions against southern  Lebanese villages and cities cannot be isolated from the bombing  plan. It is all the same conspiracy, designed to return Lebanon  to the furnace of civil war, destruction, and agony by creating  a situation in which brothers kill brothers, children die under  the rubble of burning houses, women lose their sons, the  homeland is wiped out, and sectarian sedition rises up amid the  roar of guns.    All this raises a series of persisting questions about  Israel's destructive role in Lebanon and the region. How can  Israel's peace allegations correspond with blowing up the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Juniyah, with planting bombs in  Lebanon, and with raining shells on the southern Lebanese  people? While the Israeli Government claims it had no  information about plans to carry out the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, it cannot disavow Mosad's plans to blow up churches  and schools in Lebanon. The Israeli Army also committed a new  massacre after the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Yesterday, it  used tank rockets to destroy homes in Hebron, causing scores of  casualties among Palestinian civilians.    Israel's treacherous shells cause scores of casualties among  the Palestinians and the Lebanese every day. Israel does not  care if the victims are women or children. What is important is  to ruin the Lebanese situation and destroy the Palestinian  intifadah. The results, however, run counter to Israel's  expectations. The Lebanese have enhanced their cohesion and  exposed Israel's games. Lebanon's healthy situation and its  accord will block every conspiracy. The Palestinians have also  become more determined to continue their struggle and offer  sacrifices. They are no longer frightened by Israel's tanks or  guns. Israel's destructive role in the region and the peace  process and its attempt to plunge the Middle East into the  furnace of sectarian conflicts are also exposed to the world.  Israel wants to expand and expand. There is no way for that to  happen other than via a trouble-plagued Middle East.    The results of the judiciary investigations in Lebanon  should  open the eyes of many in the West, especially those who have  sympathy for Zionism, to Israel's destructive role. This should  prompt influential sides to curb its aggressive plans, which are  aimed at returning to the law of the jungle and destroying peace  prospects in the Middle East.     "
0," LA112590-0093   313091    November 25, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition      Metro; Part B; Page 1; Column 5      1170 words      DRINKING DRIVERS NOW FACE GREATER ARREST RISK;    THE LAW: A 13.8% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE JAILED IN THE COUNTY SINCE  THE BLOOD-ALCOHOL LIMIT DROPPED TO 0.08% HAS NOT MEANT A SIMILAR RISE IN  PROSECUTIONS.      By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Drunk driving arrests in Ventura County have increased almost 14% this year  since a new law went into effect lowering the legal blood alcohol level for  driving under the influence.    The increase in the county is only slightly lower than a 16% increase reported  statewide by the California Highway Patrol, but twice the 7% increase in Los  Angeles County.    Since the new law which lowered the legal intoxication level from 0.10%  blood-alcohol to 0.08% went into effect Jan. 1, arrests in Ventura County have  increased by 13.85%, from 2,108 in the first nine months of 1989 to 2,400 in  the same period of 1990.    So far, however, the increase in arrests has not resulted in a similar increase  in prosecutions by the Ventura County district attorney's office.    The district attorney's office prosecuted 7,614 drunk driving cases last year  and by Aug. 31 this year had filed 4,907 cases -- roughly the same rate of  prosecution, prosecutors said.    Law enforcement officials said the prosecution rate in Ventura County has  remained stable partly because county prosecutors have always been tough on  prosecuting drunk drivers.    According to Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, drunk drivers also receive  tougher sentences in Ventura County than in most other counties.    Bradbury, who as part of a general policy against plea bargaining refuses to  let drunk drivers plead guilty to lesser charges, said he would like to see the  legal intoxication limit dropped to 0.00%.    Even before the legal limit was dropped, state, county and local police  officers in Ventura County sometimes arrested drivers with blood-alcohol levels  as low as 0.07% and 0.06%.    In other counties such drivers can nearly always plead guilty to reduced  charges or have their cases dismissed, law enforcement officials said. But here  the police ""know we'll prosecute those cases,"" Bradbury said.    The conviction rate is high. Of the 191 felony drunk driving cases filed in  1989, 118 have gone to court so far; 113 defendants pleaded guilty, three were  convicted, two cases were dismissed and four cases were reduced to  misdemeanors, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Totten said. None were acquitted, said  Totten, who oversees prosecution of felony drunk driving cases.    In the first nine months of 1990, 153 cases were filed; 88 of those charged  pleaded guilty, two were convicted, one case was dismissed for lack of evidence  and four were reduced to misdemeanors. None was acquitted, Totten said. The  average prison term was 28.75 months and the average jail sentence was 346  days.    Sentences in Ventura County are generally stiffer than elsewhere in the state,  officials said. Judges usually give 48-hour jail terms to first-time drunk  driving convicts who by law are eligible for a 90-day license restriction  instead.    Drunk driving convicts in Los Angeles County's Newhall Municipal Court usually  receive the license restriction instead of jail time, said Pamela Davis  Springer, the court's deputy district attorney-in-charge.    The tough atmosphere in Ventura County has kept the prosecution rate for drunk  driving cases stable despite the new law, said county Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward  F. Brodie, chief of the office's misdemeanor division.    Unlike other counties, Brodie said, drunk driving suspects here are not allowed  to plead guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving with alcohol, or ""wet  reckless,"" as it is known.    ""Counties like L.A. would give you a wet reckless at 0.12%,"" he said. ""But as  far as we were concerned if the reports indicated driving impairment in the  field sobriety tests even if the blood-alcohol was below 0.10%, we'd file the  case. And we won a substantial number of those cases . . . . Juries in our  county take a hard look at DUI drivers. And we also take a hard look at them.""    Brodie said that 5% to 10% of drunk driving cases filed here last year were  against drivers whose blood-alcohol content was below the then-legal  intoxication level of 0.10%.    This year, about 2% of the cases in this county are being filed against drivers  who test below the new level of 0.08%, he said.    ""Under a 0.08% it becomes extremely difficult to prove impairment,"" Brodie  said. ""Below that level you're looking at a lot of people sitting at the  two-beer level, depending on their weight . . . . We try to weed those cases  out at the filing stage.""    County criminalist Norman Fort said the knowledge that Ventura County has a  tough approach to drunk driving probably keeps some drinkers off the road, but  he said society is changing, too, and tolerance of drunk driving is declining  steadily.    ""If you're going to drink and drive you'd better do it in L.A. County; the odds  of you being arrested there are much less,"" said Fort, who oversees  blood-alcohol testing for the sheriff's crime lab. ""And the odds of you being  prosecuted here are much higher. We don't take plea bargains; we don't take wet  reckless as a plea or dry reckless like they do in Los Angeles.""    Assistant Public Defender Jean Farley said the atmosphere of intolerance may  drive some people with defensible cases to plead guilty.    Farley worked as a deputy public defender from 1978 to 1986 in Orange County,  where she said drunk driving charges often were reduced to wet reckless.    In Ventura County, she said, private attorneys often visit the public  defender's office for insight on their clients' drunk driving cases.    When the lawyers learn the district attorney is dead serious about prosecuting  even the low-level cases, they're shocked, Farley said.    The county's tough prosecution policies drew criticism from Mark S. Borrell,  president of the Ventura County Criminal Defense Lawyers Assn.    ""In Santa Barbara the district attorneys are interested in talking about cases,  trying to work out cases and reach dispositions that seem appropriate,"" said  Borrell, who defends drunk driving suspects here and in Santa Barbara County.    ""Down here in Ventura, essentially, once a case has been filed nobody wants to  talk about it any more, so it goes to trial . . . . We have a court system  that's already overloaded, and forcing cases to trial only adds fuel to that  fire.""    Borrell also blamed Bradbury's stated no plea-bargaining policy for some of the  court's backlog.    But Bradbury said tougher courtrooms mean safer streets.    ""What we've tried to do for a long time is change this perception that you can  drink and still be safe to drive,"" Bradbury said. ""The scientific and medical  data now indicates that you're an unsafe driver at 0.04%.""    Felony Supervisor Totten said the office's hard-nosed attitude is meant to  shake even the most irredeemable alcoholics' beliefs about drinking and  driving.

By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Drunk driving arrests in Ventura County have increased almost 14% this year  since a new law went into effect lowering the legal blood alcohol level for  driving under the influence.    The increase in the county is only slightly lower than a 16% increase reported  statewide by the California Highway Patrol, but twice the 7% increase in Los  Angeles County.    Since the new law which lowered the legal intoxication level from 0.10%  blood-alcohol to 0.08% went into effect Jan. 1, arrests in Ventura County have  increased by 13.85%, from 2,108 in the first nine months of 1989 to 2,400 in  the same period of 1990.    So far, however, the increase in arrests has not resulted in a similar increase  in prosecutions by the Ventura County district attorney's office.    The district attorney's office prosecuted 7,614 drunk driving cases last year  and by Aug. 31 this year had filed 4,907 cases -- roughly the same rate of  prosecution, prosecutors said.    Law enforcement officials said the prosecution rate in Ventura County has  remained stable partly because county prosecutors have always been tough on  prosecuting drunk drivers.    According to Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, drunk drivers also receive  tougher sentences in Ventura County than in most other counties.    Bradbury, who as part of a general policy against plea bargaining refuses to  let drunk drivers plead guilty to lesser charges, said he would like to see the  legal intoxication limit dropped to 0.00%.    Even before the legal limit was dropped, state, county and local police  officers in Ventura County sometimes arrested drivers with blood-alcohol levels  as low as 0.07% and 0.06%.    In other counties such drivers can nearly always plead guilty to reduced  charges or have their cases dismissed, law enforcement officials said. But here  the police ""know we'll prosecute those cases,"" Bradbury said.    The conviction rate is high. Of the 191 felony drunk driving cases filed in  1989, 118 have gone to court so far; 113 defendants pleaded guilty, three were  convicted, two cases were dismissed and four cases were reduced to  misdemeanors, Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Totten said. None were acquitted, said  Totten, who oversees prosecution of felony drunk driving cases.    In the first nine months of 1990, 153 cases were filed; 88 of those charged  pleaded guilty, two were convicted, one case was dismissed for lack of evidence  and four were reduced to misdemeanors. None was acquitted, Totten said. The  average prison term was 28.75 months and the average jail sentence was 346  days.    Sentences in Ventura County are generally stiffer than elsewhere in the state,  officials said. Judges usually give 48-hour jail terms to first-time drunk  driving convicts who by law are eligible for a 90-day license restriction  instead.    Drunk driving convicts in Los Angeles County's Newhall Municipal Court usually  receive the license restriction instead of jail time, said Pamela Davis  Springer, the court's deputy district attorney-in-charge.    The tough atmosphere in Ventura County has kept the prosecution rate for drunk  driving cases stable despite the new law, said county Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward  F. Brodie, chief of the office's misdemeanor division.    Unlike other counties, Brodie said, drunk driving suspects here are not allowed  to plead guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving with alcohol, or ""wet  reckless,"" as it is known.    ""Counties like L.A. would give you a wet reckless at 0.12%,"" he said. ""But as  far as we were concerned if the reports indicated driving impairment in the  field sobriety tests even if the blood-alcohol was below 0.10%, we'd file the  case. And we won a substantial number of those cases . . . . Juries in our  county take a hard look at DUI drivers. And we also take a hard look at them.""    Brodie said that 5% to 10% of drunk driving cases filed here last year were  against drivers whose blood-alcohol content was below the then-legal  intoxication level of 0.10%.    This year, about 2% of the cases in this county are being filed against drivers  who test below the new level of 0.08%, he said.    ""Under a 0.08% it becomes extremely difficult to prove impairment,"" Brodie  said. ""Below that level you're looking at a lot of people sitting at the  two-beer level, depending on their weight . . . . We try to weed those cases  out at the filing stage.""    County criminalist Norman Fort said the knowledge that Ventura County has a  tough approach to drunk driving probably keeps some drinkers off the road, but  he said society is changing, too, and tolerance of drunk driving is declining  steadily.    ""If you're going to drink and drive you'd better do it in L.A. County; the odds  of you being arrested there are much less,"" said Fort, who oversees  blood-alcohol testing for the sheriff's crime lab. ""And the odds of you being  prosecuted here are much higher. We don't take plea bargains; we don't take wet  reckless as a plea or dry reckless like they do in Los Angeles.""    Assistant Public Defender Jean Farley said the atmosphere of intolerance may  drive some people with defensible cases to plead guilty.    Farley worked as a deputy public defender from 1978 to 1986 in Orange County,  where she said drunk driving charges often were reduced to wet reckless.    In Ventura County, she said, private attorneys often visit the public  defender's office for insight on their clients' drunk driving cases.    When the lawyers learn the district attorney is dead serious about prosecuting  even the low-level cases, they're shocked, Farley said.    The county's tough prosecution policies drew criticism from Mark S. Borrell,  president of the Ventura County Criminal Defense Lawyers Assn.    ""In Santa Barbara the district attorneys are interested in talking about cases,  trying to work out cases and reach dispositions that seem appropriate,"" said  Borrell, who defends drunk driving suspects here and in Santa Barbara County.    ""Down here in Ventura, essentially, once a case has been filed nobody wants to  talk about it any more, so it goes to trial . . . . We have a court system  that's already overloaded, and forcing cases to trial only adds fuel to that  fire.""    Borrell also blamed Bradbury's stated no plea-bargaining policy for some of the  court's backlog.    But Bradbury said tougher courtrooms mean safer streets.    ""What we've tried to do for a long time is change this perception that you can  drink and still be safe to drive,"" Bradbury said. ""The scientific and medical  data now indicates that you're an unsafe driver at 0.04%.""    Felony Supervisor Totten said the office's hard-nosed attitude is meant to  shake even the most irredeemable alcoholics' beliefs about drinking and  driving.    ""For a person to change his behavior and go dry, he has to hit bottom, and we  like to think that one of the things that criminal prosecution does is raise  the bottom for people,"" Totten said. ""Where there are still that hard-core  group that will continue to drink, regardless, a lot of people who do get sent  to prison are going to change their behavior.""    "

Legally an arrest warrant is no proof of guilt. But in this  particular case such a warrant will indicate that the judiciary  is virtually convinced of Ja'ja''s involvement in the bombing of  Sayyidat al-Najat Church.    The fact that no warrant has been served on Ja'Ja' yet, the  sources say, does not mean that his name did not come up during  the investigations or that there are no grounds for indicting  him.    The reason that no such warrant has been issued, the sources  add, is because of the technical and security peculiarities of  the case, as well as certain political and psychological  considerations.    While mere suspicion would normally suffice for serving  arrest warrants, both the judiciary and the Lebanese state are  hesitant to issue such a warrant in this case without backing it  with conclusive evidence, according to the same sources.

The attacks by supporters of the Mujahideen Khalq opposition group followed Sunday's bombing raids by eight Iranian F-4 jets on Mujahideen bases in Iraq  -the first Iranian air strike against its neighbour since the end of the 1980-88 Gulf war. Iraq has complained to the UN Security Council about the raids, France yesterday condemned the raids, saying they risked igniting further violence in the region. 'Regional peace could be in danger,' said Mr Daniel Bernard, Foreign Ministry spokesman. He also condemned the subsequent attacks on Iranian embassies. Ambassadors from countries in which Iranian embassies were attacked were summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Tehran yesterday for a strong protest. A ministry spokesman was quoted as saying that the demonstrators should be extradited and compensation paid for damage to the missions. The raid also revived hostile exchanges between the two former belligerents, with Iran demanding that Iraq cease supporting the Mujahideen. Iraqi newspapers meanwhile condemned the raid, suggesting that the US lay behind the bombing.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The attack is the worst on foreigners in Egypt in the past 18 months, which has seen sporadic violence against tourists by Islamic extremists. Police said the gunman, who had been sitting in the Felucca restaurant of the Semiramis Intercontinental Hotel, suddenly stood up and fired on diners with a revolver. The shooting is likely to be a devastating blow to Egypt's tourism industry, already crippled by earlier attacks. It happened on the same day as President Hosni Mubarak sought to assure his US hosts in Washington that Egypt's recent security problems were resolved. His confidence was based on a lull in attacks after security operations against suspected militants. An American, an Italian and a third person of unknown origin died in the shooting, doctors said. The injured included another American, a Syrian and a French citizen. The gunman and two others were arrested. Last year an English woman was shot by extremists in Upper Egypt, while a Turk and a Swede died in the bombing of a Cairo cafe in February.   Countries:-  EGZ  Egypt, Africa.

During the three days, the capital throbbed to the rhythm of  meringues composed for the occasion. There were no colors or  traditional floats in the 1994 version of Haitian Carnival.  However, Champs-de-Mars and other main streets of Port-au-Prince  welcomed thousands of people who celebrated this huge popular  festival to their heart's content. No official theme was  designated for 1994 but there was music, which served as a  bridge among the various social classes hugging each other in  the streets, forgetting the embargo and the political crisis.

0,FT924-5768 ,"FT924-5768 _AN-CKYCPACYFT 921125   FT  25 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Terror uninsured   SINCE THE bombing of the Commercial Union building in the City of London in April, it has become clear that the insurance industry is reluctant to provide cover against acts of terrorism in mainland Britain. The large continental reinsurance groups, which underwrote much of the estimated Pounds 800m cost of the CU bombing, have little remaining appetite for such business. British insurers lack the capital to take the full risk onto their own books. The question is whether the government will have to act as an underwriter of last resort. The insurance problems arising from terrorism in mainland Britain are a direct concern chiefly for a small number of high-profile companies and institutions. These companies bear a disproportionate share of the cost of maintaining stable business conditions for the community as a whole. Yet less vulnerable businesses, which derive benefits from a stable trading environment, are understandably reluctant to pay higher premiums after the bombing of a giant City office block. The case for government involvement is that the private sector cannot achieve an equitable sharing of the costs of maintaining stability in conditions that occasionally border on war. The government has been obliged to accept the logic of this argument in Northern Ireland, where criminal damage compensation arrangements have existed since the late 1960s. But it is not inclined to extend it to the mainland for understandable reasons. One is that ministers might be accused of 'giving in to terrorism'. Another is cost. Yet terrorism wins a far bigger victory if Britain's leading companies are forced to constrain their operations to cope with the terrorist threat; if large office blocks sustain falls in value because they cannot be insured against terrorist acts; and if foreign financial institutions are tempted to take their operations to other financial centres in the European time zone where insurance is more readily obtainable. The point of compensation is that it neuters the economic impact of terrorist violence - a case not of acquiescence but of countering terrorism by other means. The government cannot be blamed for seeking to minimise the bill: the potential liability in mainland Britain is palpably greater than in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, lengthy discussions drag on between representatives of British industry, insurance providers and the government to look for a middle way whereby public-sector financial support could be harnessed to a market framework, so reducing the cost to the state. The problem is that the market has already fought shy, because no actuary can assess the risk of how often further bombings may occur and to what effect. That suggests that a halfway house will be difficult to achieve: if the risk is uncommercial, establishing a basis for sharing it between public and private sector will be a nightmare. Whether or not the government falls back on the approach adopted in Northern Ireland, there can be no escape from some form of state involvement. It may be an uncomfortable role, but it is a proper one for government.  The Financial Times   London Page 18  "

A bodyguard was injured. The bomb was detonated as the minister's car crossed a flyover in the centre of Bogota, the Colombian capital. Shrapnel shredded the vehicle's boot and bent in a door. Mr Hommes said later he had received death threats but did not know who from. He has been finance minister for three-and-a-half years, responsible for opening up the Colombian economy since the beginning of President Cesar Gaviria's administration. Economic liberalisation and policies to reduce inflation have become increasingly unpopular, particularly with the political left. The attack is being attributed to Communist guerrillas, though no organisation claimed responsibility immediately. Guerrilla groups are stepping up action in rural areas with the approach of congressional and presidential elections, scheduled for March 13 and May 8.

Police beatings, arrests and executions without trial and mass killings have been reported, despite a climate that increasingly highlights the importance of human rights, the report says. 'Human rights defenders often became the first victims of governments trying to build a good human rights image abroad and fearful of the damage human rights activists can do to that image.' The report, covering 151 countries, found that prisoners of conscience were held in 63 countries, more than 100,000 political prisoners were held without charge or trial in 53, more than 112 governments tortured or ill-treated prisoners, and political killings by the state took place in 61 nations. Some 2,000 people were executed in 32 countries last year.

Mr Selim Sadak, MP for Sirnak in Turkey's Kurdish heartland, writing to the interior minister, Mr Nahit Mentese, demanded a government investigation of allegations of bombing by Turkish military aircraft of Kurdish villages in which he claimed at least 48 people were killed. The government said earlier that a bomb had been dropped by accident. The incident underscores the violent escalation in the fighting, with more than 4,000 guerrillas, soldiers and civilians killed in the past year. The Turkish government has dismissed the situation as a PKK propaganda ploy. Foreign ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman vehemently denied eyewitness reports that villages were being deliberately targeted by security forces. The PKK has increased attacks against targets in western Turkey in recent months, including the killing of five off-duty Turkish army conscripts in Istanbul. The intensified conflict is causing concern in western capitals. The German foreign minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, last week said the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should convene a conference on the problem.

It is hoping to put them beyond the reach of western governments which are pressing for retaliation against Tripoli's alleged complicity in the bombing of US and French airliners. The move of government assets emerged yesterday as the US, Britain and France considered asking the United Nations Security Council to back sanctions against Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's regime for failing to hand over two agents accused of bombing a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie. British officials said they would seek a ban on civil aviation to Libya, an arms embargo and a downgrading of diplomatic status for Tripoli. Bankers and officials in London and the Middle East say Libya has already taken steps to pre-empt further economic sanctions by discreetly moving liquid assets from vulnerable banking centres to friendly Arab countries. This massive shift of Libyan assets over the past few months coincides with concerted western pressure on Colonel Gadaffi, including threats of possible military action. Bank of England figures show that between March and September 1991 Libya halved its deposits in British banks to Pounds 781m. Libyan cash and other liquid assets, mainly held overseas to service the import needs of its oil industry, have also been removed from other European centres. Bankers in London confirm that deposits withdrawn in the past few months from Arab institutions in the city have been placed with banks in Bahrain. 'Libya feels it has some sympathy among other Arab countries,' said a London banker familiar with the shift. 'And the obvious place to put the money is with banks in the Gulf region.' Libya's overseas assets measured by the Bank for International Settlements in Basle totalled Dollars 6.5bn at the end of September 1991. In a separate move aimed at protecting its assets from seizure, Libya is understood to be demanding payment for its oil exports, wherever possible, in Swiss francs, rather than dollars, according to bankers and oil industry executives. The aim is to minimise the number of transactions which must be cleared through US banks, where Tripoli fears they would be vulnerable to seizure. All international transactions in dollars, even if they take place outside the US, must be cleared through New York. The US authorities have sought to use this to impede dealings they regard as undesirable, such as trading in dollars with Vietnam, with which Americans are forbidden from doing business. 'Libya since the end of December has not transferred money through the dollar if it can help it,' said one senior Arab banker. Another Libyan banker, who has been monitoring the steady flow of Tripoli's assets into havens, said the regime had learnt from its experience in 1986 when Washington froze Dollars 2bn of Libyan assets in the US in retaliation for its alleged part in terrorist attacks. To head off sanctions, Libya has raised the possibility of handing over the two agents to the US, on condition that the US in turn offers an 'improvement of bilateral relations'. The suggestions comes in a report to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, compiled after the return of his special envoy from Tripoli. This contains a series of proposals by Libya to resolve the confrontation. But British officials said these were 'confusing' and 'inadequate'. Diplomats in New York said the offer, revealed in the UN secretary-general's report, was an improvement on Libya's earlier intransigence, but insufficient to prevent the US, Britain and France from pursuing possible sanctions. Libyan money has long been on the move, Page 4  The Financial Times   London Page 1  "
0,FT934-12716 ,"FT934-12716 _AN-DJZDHAAGFT 931026   FT  26 OCT 93 / Major rules out deal with IRA on ceasefire: Adams banned from entering Britain - Mayhew condemns 'sickening hypocrisy'      By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor   THE British government angrily rejected last night a proposal from Mr Gerry Adams for a conditional IRA ceasefire and announced the Sinn Fein leader had been banned from entering Great Britain. It accused Mr Adams of 'sickening hypocrisy' and set an unconditional and permanent end to violence as a precondition for the IRA and its supporters to be brought into any negotiations on the future of Ulster. The message was reinforced by the announcement that Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, had signed an indefinite exclusion order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The order - signed before the latest IRA bombing in Belfast - prevents the Sinn Fein leader from travelling from Ulster to any other part of the UK. As the weekend killing of Protestant civilians in Belfast's Shankill Road was followed by a bomb attack on a mainland railway line, Mr John Major came close to dismissing the initiative drawn up with Mr Adams by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. But the government was careful not to extend its denunciation to Mr Hume's role in preparing the proposals. Last night Protestant terrorists claimed responsibility for the murder of a Catholic in North Belfast. Earlier a Catholic taxi-driver died in hospital after a revenge shooting in response to the Shankill Road bombing. Mr Adams told the BBC a positive response from the London government to the Hume-Adams proposals could bring an IRA ceasefire. But at the Commonwealth summit in Cyprus, Mr Major retorted: 'I am not going to do deals with people who plant bombs and kill innocent people.' That view was echoed in the House of Commons by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, as the latest IRA attacks brought universal condemnation from government and opposition MPs. In a sombre denunciation of the Belfast bombing - which killed nine Protestant civilians as well as one of the terrorists - Sir Patrick said: 'Next to the sickening quality of what was done to people in the Shankill on Saturday has been the sickening quality of the hypocrisy of Mr Adams.' The condition for dialogue with Sinn Fein and the IRA was an end to violence 'without condition and forever'. The Northern Ireland secretary, however, 'saluted' Mr Hume for his courage in seeking a settlement. Senior ministers said they saw no real prospect of the Hume-Adams proposals' leading to a lasting settlement, but could not afford to reject them out of hand before they had been formally presented by Dublin. Mr Hume said the British government could not afford to reject a set of proposals which had as their objective a 'lasting peace and total cessation of violence'. But Mr Major underlined the gulf between the two sides by accusing Mr Adams of blackmail: 'If Mr Adams can end the violence then he should end the violence now without preconditions, without any delay . . . and without any proposals which sound to me tantamount to blackmail.' Sir Patrick's Commons statement was quickly followed by the announcement of the exclusion order against Mr Adams. The announcement from Mr Howard - who signed the order last Tuesday - said that Mr Adams was or is concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism connected with Northern Ireland. The decision came after reports that the Sinn Fein leader was planning to visit Great Britain at the invitation of Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP. The rail network in southern England was in chaos after the IRA detonated a bomb on the main line from London to the west of England. Two bombs were placed in Reading, one of which exploded several hours after the first had been successfully defused. Police said the second blast had been calculated to kill workers from the emergency services responding to a coded warning of the first attack.

The secretary for foreign affairs in the Libyan General  People's Congress, Saad Mustafa Mujbar [name and title as  received], said Wednesday his country commended Malaysia for  reserving its stand on imposing wide sanctions against Libya.    The sanctions were imposed in April 1992 following Libya's  refusal to hand over two of its citizens for trial in the United  States in connection with the 1988 bombing of Pan America Flight  103 over Lockerbie in Scotland in which 270 people were killed.    Mujbar, who leaves for home today after a four-day visit,  told a press conference that Libya was ready to co-operate with  the international community to reach the truth, but not to the  extent of violating its laws and constitution.    A proposal by Scotland to have the two suspects tried in  Scotland was rejected by the United States, Britain and France.     "

Two students were  arrested, and two others were being sought.    The students were angered by a ban on all but official school baseball caps and  wide-ranging authorization for school officials to prohibit any clothing  regarded as gang-oriented.    Class boycotts at Palmdale High School and Antelope Valley High School in  Lancaster drew about 200 students each.    At Antelope Valley High, the demonstration led to an assault on    the patrol car of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, deputies said.    About 200 students rushed a sheriff's sergeant who had detained four men off  campus about 11:20 a.m., pelting his car with rocks and debris and chanting  ""Let them go,"" deputies said.

Ron Shreves said, but the demonstrators may have  believed those being detained were fellow students.    A 16-year-old boy described as a leader of the group was arrested and detained  at Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, said Shreves. He and two other students will be  charged with assault, Shreves said.    School Principal Yvonne Healey said she could not confirm the Sheriff's  Department's version of the incident.    At Palmdale High School, about 200 students staged a peaceful but noisy walkout  for three hours. Most returned to classes about 10:30 a.m. after deputies  warned the protesters they could be arrested. No arrests were made.    But at Quartz Hill High School, a 16-year-old boy was arrested for threatening  a teacher when school administrators began seizing banned baseball caps from  students during a morning sweep of the campus, said Deputy Gil Arce.    The protests reflected widespread student discontent with the controversial  dress code adopted last month by the Board of Trustees of the Antelope Valley  Union High School District. School officials began enforcing the code  Wednesday.    Students at the three main campuses, arguing that the policy unfairly infringes  on their rights and will do little to halt gang violence, said they plan to  protest again at Wednesday night's school board meeting.    School officials said they did not expect further student class boycotts today.    ""People should be able to dress the way they want at a public high school,""  said Scott Welcome, a 16-year-old Palmdale High School junior and one of the  protesters.    ""They're just trying to turn this school into a prison. Why should we suffer  for what the gang-bangers do?"" asked Jason Oster, a 15-year-old sophomore.    Despite the arrests and protests, officials in the 10,000-student district said  they remained content with the new policy and have no immediate plans to change  it. ""All I've said is it's going to take some time for the kids to understand  what the policy is,"" said Dist. Supt. Kenneth Brummel.    The new policy outlaws any attire that school officials consider gang-related,  including all non-high school baseball caps, the policy's only blanket  prohibition.    Students who violate the policy first get a warning, then a suspension for a  second offense, and possible expulsion beyond that.    However, the district's decision to not provide a specific list of what it  considers gang-related clothing and apparel has led to widespread  misunderstandings of the policy among students. School officials said they  believe that is partly responsible for the protests.    Students repeatedly ticked off long lists of brands, types or colors of  clothing Thursday that they said have been banned by the district, including  British Knight tennis shoes -- called ""Blood Killers"" in gang parlance,  referring to one of two main gang groupings -- -- professional sports team  jackets and even any clothes in solid blue or red.    But school officials insisted that such clothing has not been banned, if it is  not part of a broader dressing pattern that indicates gang membership. ""It has  to do with the manner, the situation, the combinations of clothing that might  be observed,"" said Palmdale Principal Linda Janzen.

Meanwhile, more than 300 fighter-bombers, assault planes,  observation planes, helicopter gunships and reconnaissance  planes belonging to the U.S. Air Force based in South Korea and  the puppet air force staged an exercise in the air above  Yongwol, Chungju, Yoju and Oeyon islet on the same day for the  purpose of bombing, support for ground units and aerial warfare.    Synchronizing with the exercise, RC-135, RV-1, RC-12 and  other tactical reconnaissance planes flew on the mission of  aerial photographing and electronic espionage on the coastline,  the forward and inland areas of the North.

They confirmed a report in the local press that a  38-year-old  man identified as the head of the group described as religious  extremists who sought to undermine national security and a  member of the faction were detained on Thursday.    The sources identified the leader by his initials as W.I.  and  said his arrest was a major breakthough in investigations into a  series of sabotage and attempted sabotage in the country over  the past few months.    A car used by the two was intercepted after a chase and  gunfight during which a policeman was wounded in the leg, the  report said. The vehicle yielded an assortment of weapons, it  said. Investigations were continuing.    Friday's arrests raised the number of suspects detained in  connection with extremist plots in the past few months to 35.  Twenty-three of them were earlier expected to be put on trial in  mid-April charged with plotting and carrying out subversion  through bombings at public places.    But, with the new arrests, it is expected all the 35 could  be  put on trial together as a single group, the sources said.    Most of the suspects have confessed and reenacted the crimes  and attempted crimes in the presence of prosecutors, security  official said.    The trial was expected to start in mid-April, but  investigations and gathering of evidence are continuing. ""It  might take some weeks before the cases are sent to court,"" said  one source.    Details of the charges faced by others and the time of their  arrests remained sketchy, but the sources affirmed that there  was enough evidence to prove that most of them had plotted to  destabilise security and create chaos in the country.    It was also not clear whether all the suspects were linked  with each other. The sources said there appeared to be two or  three small groups operating independent of each other, possibly  under orders from a single faction or individual.    However, one of the threads that bound all was their  background as ""Arab Afghans""--volunteers who fought with the  Afghan Mujahedeen against the Soviet occupation of  Afghanistan--of affiliation with them, according to the sources.    Apart from the 23 who are expected to go on trial soon, at  least 10 others are reported to be members of a shadowy  organisation calling itself ""Jihad Islami Organisation,"" whose  leader was arrested on Friday.    The group's members had carried out several hold-ups of taxi  drivers and other places and were planning to rob banks to raise  funds to buy arms before they were arrested, reports said.    Parliament members representing the Islamic Action Front  (IAF) met with Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali last week  with an appeal for the release of some of the detainees, whose  number they put at 73.    According to the sources, some of those who fought in  Afghanistan were detained for interrogation immediately upon  their return home over the past months. It was not immediately  clear whether prosecutors had been able to establish any link  between them and those who were arrested in connection with the  bombings and attempted attacks in Jordan.    IAF officials stressed that they were not intervening on  behalf of any of those who were found to have been involved in  subversion, but that many of the detainees were innocent of any  crime and therefore should be released.    Most of the ""Arab Afghans"" are believed to be ex-members of  the Muslim Brotherhood who broke away in protest against the  moderate policies followed by the leadership, experts on  Jordanian Islamic movements say.    ""Although they are no longer active members, the Brotherhood  has no choice but to intervene on their behalf to protect its  own image with the ranks and file,"" said an expert and long-time  observer of the movement.    Senior Brotherhood leaders have dismissed as baseless report  in Europe-based Arabic-language magazines that some of the  suspects were directly linked to the movement. The Brotherhood  might even file lawsuits against those magazines for defamation,  the leaders said.     "

The Rwandan  foreign minister has been in Paris since last Monday [25 April].  Jerome Bicamumpaka was received at the Elysee, at the Matignon  [prime minister's office], and at the Foreign Ministry. The  next leg of Jerome Bicamumpaka's visit was to be Belgium, but it  will probably not take place, Monique Mas says:    [Mas] No, Brussels does not wish to receive Jerome  Bicamumpaka. The Belgian Foreign Ministry has even stressed that  the visa he demanded was refused. Belgium has not severed its  diplomatic relations with Rwanda and it is thus continuing to  deal with the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels. It is difficult,  however, for Belgium to receive the representative of a  government which it has accused of involvement in the attack on  the presidential plane and a government which put all the  responsibility for the bloodbath on the Rwandan civilian  opposition and the FPR [Rwandan Patriotic Front], and above all  on the United Nations and, especially, the Belgian blue helmets.

NEARLY 600 ACTIVISTS ARE ARRESTED.      By DANICA KIRKA      MERCURY, Nev.      Seven UC Irvine students were among the first anti-nuclear activists who were  arrested Saturday during a daylong protest at a federal underground nuclear  testing range.    Eighteen UCI students and alumni were among about 1,500 protesters at the  Nevada Test Site, 68 miles northwest of Las Vegas. By late Saturday, nearly 600  protesters had been arrested, with dozens more waiting to be processed.    As they stepped onto test site property, the seven UCI students were met by Nye  County sheriff's deputies, who smiled and chatted with them. The students  handed the officers handmade toy missiles, which were used in a mock theater  presentation staged just before their arrests to protest the University of  California's participation in nuclear weapons research at laboratories in  Livermore and Los Alamos.    The demonstrators were participating in a five-day Decade to Disarm protest,  sponsored by three peace groups: American Peace Test, the Western Shoshone  Council and a Soviet anti-nuclear group called the Nevada Movement.    Nevada Highway Patrol Capt. Glenn Jewett said most of the arrests occurred when  the demonstrators crossed a cattle grate at the main Mercury entrance and  stepped onto the federal property that includes the nation's top-secret nuclear  testing grounds.    ""It is important that some students take the step and cross that line,"" said  Jessica James, a first-year music and biology student who was arrested.    ""Being from UCI, we have a specific aim in opposing the connection that (UC)  has with nuclear weapons,"" she said.    The arrested UCI students were taken to a holding pen. Authorities said they  would be cited for trespassing and released on their own recognizance.    Also arrested were: Joetta Moon, 25, a UCI graduate; Jeff Rouder, 23, a  graduate student in anthropology; Caephren McKenna, 20, a political science and  psychology major; Stephanie Lasko, 19, a drama major; Kate Sullivan, 19, a  sophomore undeclared major, and Bob Harrison, 19, a freshman English major.    Shortly before being arrested, the students donned mortarboards fashioned from  black construction paper. On their backs, they hung signs noting their class  year. They then lined up, blindfolded themselves with white streamers and began  humming a loud rendition of ""Pomp and Circumstance,"" the graduation theme.    Each student handed play money to a fellow student, who wore a sign designating  her to be a UC representative. The students then accepted ""diplomas"" -- in the  shape of miniature missiles, covered with aluminum foil and tied with a red  ribbon. They then read statements condemning UC involvement in nuclear  research.    The presentation was meant to symbolize that students blindly hand over money  to the UC system without questioning how it is being used, said Wendy Doetkott,  23, a UCI senior and a protest organizer.    ""A few of us have thought we'd come to the university's graduation and repeat  the same ceremony,"" said Joetta Moon, 25, a UCI graduate. ""That's still being  discussed.""    Authorities promised to return the mock missiles to the students after they are  released.    The action began Thursday and was timed to coincide with last week's deployment  of the Trident II missile from Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in southern  Georgia, organizers said. The Trident II is the Navy's most powerful nuclear  weapon.    Similar demonstrations were held this weekend in Great Britain, West Germany  and the Soviet Union, American Peace Test spokeswoman Katherin Dress said.    Highway Patrol spokesman Jewett said Saturday's action was peaceful. ""It's a  good crowd,"" he said.    However, protesters closed the access road at the Mercury entrance for more  than five hours when they blocked the highway, then built a rock wall across  it.    Highway Patrol trooper Phillip Dart said the highway had been closed for about  five hours when Department of Transportation workers were called at 5 p.m. to  remove the rocks. The road was expected to be cleared early Saturday evening.    The student action was part of a demonstration that has taken place annually at  the test site for several years.    But this year's crowd appeared to be smaller than in previous years, when  protesters numbered about 8,000, Dart said.    Many members of Saturday's crowd linked arms and skirted the perimeter of the  site, creating a colorful band against the bleak, brown desert property.    Some carried flags and banners. Others carried water and beat small snare  drums, giving the otherwise-cheerful crowd a solemn tone.    Most of those who set up camp about a mile from the main entrance of the site  were college students, including contingents from UC Santa Cruz and UC Santa  Barbara.    Several high schools, including Brentwood High School in Los Angeles County,  were also represented.    Michael Valleo, 18, a student at Brentwood, said a recent visit to the Soviet  Union convinced him that the U.S.S.R is as interested in peace as the United  States is.    ""I don't see any reason to kill millions of people when we could be saving  them,"" he said. ""We all want peace.""    The Irvine students said they hope the demonstration and their arrests will  inform other students of UC nuclear activities and pressure the governing body  of the system, the Board of Regents, to cut ties with the Department of Energy  and the Department of Defense that involve nuclear weapons.    The UC Irvine Academic Senate is expected to take up the issue this spring.  Similar discussions are taking place at other UC campuses.    In the heart of conservative Orange County, it is often tough to be an activist  at UCI, said the students who camped out on the stretch of desert, but they  found the company of the fellow protesters reassuring.    ""At Irvine, you can feel so alone,"" Harrison said.    But the students said such protests show that their activism is changing. From  beside a large tent decorated with a U.S. flag emblazoned with a peace symbol,  UCI students such as Doetkott said the emphasis on nonviolence in protests is  the biggest change.    ""You don't see the kind of atrocities that occurred"" in the 1960s, she said,  noting that both police and protesters are educated now in civil disobedience.    The police ""treat us a lot better,"" she said.    Equally important, the students said, is that UCI activists are more organized  than ever. They use the word networking, have newsletters and have a core group  that acts as an umbrella organization for their causes.    Several students protesting Saturday have also demonstrated for gay rights at  UCI and have demanded more participation in student affairs.    ""What we're dealing with is serious,"" McKenna said. ""We're dealing with the  future.""    Associated Press and United Press International contributed to this story.

At first the story was put about that the tragedy occurred  as  the result of mortar fire, allegedly from positions held by  Serbian armed formations. Later, when the real scale of this  inhuman carnage began to become apparent, people started saying  that the fire might not have come from Serbian positions but  from some others. Then they started saying that the series of  explosions occurred right on the spot as the result of charges  which had been laid earlier and which someone (but who?!) set  off.    It is beyond doubt that, whoever was to blame for this  tragedy, this killer (or killers) must be punished and appear  before a court. Is this not the reason why the international  tribunal in The Hague for crimes against the person on territory  in the former Yugoslavia was set up? Only I believe that this  killer will never be found. There are several points which  cause me to think along these lines.    Right after the tragedy, the Serbian side in Bosnia issued a  statement in which it urged the holding of an international  investigation into the crime that had been committed and  guaranteed unimpeded access to the site for international  experts. Why would it do this if some people accuse precisely  it of the tragedy?    There are other disconcerting points. This is not the first  such instance, you know. More than a year ago, also in  Sarajevo, a shell allegedly fired from a tank gun killed 20  people and injured dozens of peaceful residents at a bus stop  close to the market in the Muslim districts. Then too there  were demands for the Serb tankman who allegedly drove up to that  spot and fired the shot to be called to account. There were  calls for NATO aircraft to start bombing Serbian positions  without delay. Then it turned out that neither the tank nor the  mythical Serbian tankman had existed. The author of that  tragedy was never found.    It cannot escape your notice that both these events occurred  on the eve of the conclusion of peace talks among the three  warring sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At that time the talks  were wrecked.    By the beginning of 1994 the Serbs and Croats had virtually  completely agreed their positions and displayed readiness to end  hostilities. The Muslim side had also begun to voice  satisfaction with the talks. The very dangerous military  conflict at the center of Europe seemed to be finally  approaching a peaceful outcome. But suddenly (suddenly?) the  position of the Bosnia and Herzegovina leadership hardened, and  it demanded territorial concessions from the Serbs and Croats.  In the end, the concessions were made. The talks were led out  of the impasse. But the Muslim side again, for the umpteenth  time, pulled out of the talks process and left Geneva virtually  without advancing any new terms at all, but demanding that the  West make bombing strikes against Serbian positions.    Once again the impasse was being surmounted, and the Serbs,  Croats, and Muslims were to meet once again in Geneva 10  February to continue the peace talks process. The tragedy in  Sarajevo could prevent that meeting.    But who would benefit from wrecking the peace talks even at  the cost of spilling a lot of blood of Sarajevo's peaceful  residents? This is the hardest question. In any case it is  perfectly obvious that neither the Serbs, nor the Croats, nor  the Muslim leadership itself benefit from the talks being  wrecked.    There is evidently still someone who cannot stomach the  possible peaceful outcome of the Balkan conflict. It is this  ""someone"" who is resorting to provocations, not afraid of blood.  It seems to me that he must be sought not among those who are  already tired of fighting and shedding their blood. The  shortest way to find him could be to ascertain just who is  constantly pressuring the Bosnia and Herzegovina leadership and  compelling it to walk out of the talks time after time. But  this, so it seems to me, is a matter for the international  tribunal in The Hague.     "

Police sources contacted by RNE say that the operation is still  going on but they have refused to reveal the identities of those  arrested. They could be connected with the terrorist  organization's support infrastructure in France. The arrests  seem to be a result of investigations carried out by the Paris  investigating magistrate, Laurence Levert, on ETA but other  sources also believe that there is a link between the  extradition to Spain on 2 June under the emergency procedure,  that is without the customary hearing, of ETA member Jose  Domingo Aizpurua Aizpuru, alias Pitxas, just as he was leaving  Fleury prison on the outskirts of Paris where he had just served  a sentence for criminal association.

By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A Newhall woman on trial for allegedly killing a motorcyclist while driving  drunk had to be held down by four officers and a jail nurse in order to test  her blood-alcohol level after the accident, a California Highway patrol officer  testified Thursday.    Patricia Lee Giunta, who has had five other drunk-driving arrests and one  conviction, also struggled with officers when she was arrested after the crash,  CHP Officer Frank Lewis testified at Giunta's trial on a charge of vehicular  manslaughter.    The accident on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley on Oct. 4, 1989, killed  a Canadian student, David Jaggs, 24, and seriously injured his wife of one  month, Janine, 21.    Lewis said Giunta, 41, twice agreed to breath and blood tests, but then refused  to cooperate. Finally, Lewis said, he, another CHP officer, two jail officers  and a jail nurse restrained Giunta on a gurney while blood was drawn from her  arm to determine the amount of alcohol in her system.    According to court records, Giunta's blood-alcohol content was 0.29% -- more  than three times the level at which a motorist is considered legally drunk.    Jaggs, ironically, was the son of an Anglican priest who counsels alcoholics  and drug addicts in Windsor, Ontario.    CHP Officer Robert Koetting, who investigated the case, said it is ""highly  unusual"" for a drunk-driving suspect to resist a blood-alcohol test to the  point where it must be performed forcibly.    But refusal was not unusual for Giunta, who prosecutors said was acquitted in  two previous drunk-driving cases largely because she had refused to submit to  blood-alcohol tests, which are usually the key prosecution evidence.    Officers cannot force a drunk-driving suspect to submit to blood-alcohol tests  unless they are making a felony arrest for an accident in which someone was  killed or injured, as was the case when Giunta was arrested following the crash  that killed Jaggs. Refusal to allow such a test, however, is grounds for  revocation of the suspect's driver's license.    Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman Bill Gengler said Giunta's license was  revoked for two years in January for the accident that killed Jaggs and again  in April for refusing a blood-alcohol test after she was arrested on another  drunk-driving charge while free on bail in the current case.    Investigators describe Giunta as a shrewd defendant who knows how to manipulate  the legal system and play up to juries in order to secure an acquittal or  dismissal.    ""After five trials, I think she knows what to do,"" said Deputy Dist. Atty.  Carol Whyte. Whyte lost the case in August in which Giunta was accused of  driving drunk while free on bail less than a month after the accident that  killed Jaggs.    Robert Fernandez, Giunta's attorney, who also has represented her in three  previous drunk-driving cases, said authorities are pursuing his client with  unnecessary vigor and accused past investigators of lying about evidence.    ""There is a mentality that she's slipped through the system and that they have  to convict her at any cost,"" Fernandez said. ""I do believe they want to put her  away.""    Fernandez, who declined to talk about the current trial, said Giunta ""has not  beat the system through any kind of tactics. The juries absolved her.""    In all but one of Giunta's five other arrests, she has either been acquitted or  had the cases dismissed. In 1983, she was sentenced to probation and ordered to  perform community service.    The Rev. Ken Jaggs, the dead man's father, who has worked for 23 years  counseling alcoholics and drug addicts, said Thursday that the death of his son  has affected his work.    The elder Jaggs, 62, said he now confronts patients more aggressively with the  possible consequences of their addictions. He said jail is appropriate for  repeat offenders provided they receive treatment while locked up.    Although he refused to comment on the case against Giunta, Jaggs said ""we want  to see justice done.""    Prosecutors interviewed this week said they were discouraged that her previous  arrests are not admissible evidence in Giunta's trial.    ""She's a danger to society and the sad thing is that you have 12 members of the  community who don't know what a danger she is,"" Whyte said.

Both establishments are a hangover from when Britain ruled the waves, and such palatial premises are now far from ideal. Indeed, the bombing has helped solve a difficult problem of what to do with growing numbers of empty offices. The Baltic, like the Stock Exchange, no longer needs a trading floor. A telephone and computer are all that's needed. If David Mellor, the new heritage minister, can be conned into paying for the Baltic's restoration, all well and good. But with Pounds 75m of insurance cover, its members are in the lucky position of being able to shop around a bombed-out property market. Citicorp's expensively refurbished Billingsgate fish market already has the edge over the Royal Exchange and the Corn Exchange as the Baltic's new home. The reason is that it has a bar. 'Wherever we go has to have one', says Baltic chairman Peter Tudball. 'It's the way business has always been done,' he adds.  The Financial Times   London Page 19  "

After taking a rap over the head,  the dog subdued the suspect until officers arrived. It turned out to be his  last arrest.      Beaten, Kicked    ""It was just another day at the office for him,"" said Welz's handler, Sgt. John  W. Bell. ""He's been beaten, kicked and shot at. He's found criminals in the  most unlikely places -- on roofs, in trees, in cars, where it would take an  army of officers to find someone, he does it.""    Welz, who was born in Germany in 1980, proved his excellence in numerous  statewide competitions. He became the first canine with the Inglewood Police  Department to win a gold medal in the statewide Police Olympics and a silver  medal in the World Games, an international competition. While on duty, the dog  was known for his fearlessness, his tracking skills and his ability to discern  the good guys from the bad.

""Welz was the  envy of many, many handlers.""

When not sprinting down city streets after gang members, Welz would spend time  in senior citizen homes, hospitals and schools allowing just about anybody to  pat him on the head.    ""The school kids would say, 'He only bites bad people so I must be good,' ""  Bell said.    The dog began his career with Bell in 1983 at the age of 2 1/2. He is now 9  1/2, a few months past the usual retirement age for a police dog, and a senior  citizen in human terms.    Although Welz is still a very good police dog, Bell said, he was beginning to  slow down and show some signs of age.      Adapting to Retirement    Like many who retire, it has taken time for Welz to adjust to the far less  strenuous life style. When Bell first began leaving the house in the morning  alone, he said, Welz seemed disappointed and would whine and cry by the front  door.    But Welz is becoming more mellow, Bell says. He has added a few pounds and is  beginning to acknowledge his new role as a house pet.    And now it's Bell, a 16-year veteran with the Inglewood police who was recently  promoted from an officer in the K-9 Corps to a sergeant in the patrol division,  who has the adjusting to do.    Bell and his four-legged partner were virtually inseparable over the last six  years. They worked together all day, worked out together on the beach on  weekends, and on Sunday Welz would sit patiently in the back of the church.    ""He's been a real steady portion of my life,"" Bell said. ""I've told a lot of  things to him I wouldn't tell another human being. . . . Who knows? Maybe I'll  try to sneak him into the office.""      Photo, Officer Dean Young gives pizza to Welz, who assisted in more than 1,000  arrests in career with the Inglewood Police.

""The school kids would say, 'He only bites bad people so I must be good,' ""  Bell said.    The dog began his career with Bell in 1983 at the age of 2 1/2. He is now 9  1/2, a few months past the usual retirement age for a police dog, and a senior  citizen in human terms.    Although Welz is still a very good police dog, Bell said, he was beginning to  slow down and show some signs of age.      Adapting to Retirement    Like many who retire, it has taken time for Welz to adjust to the far less  strenuous life style. When Bell first began leaving the house in the morning  alone, he said, Welz seemed disappointed and would whine and cry by the front  door.    But Welz is becoming more mellow, Bell says. He has added a few pounds and is  beginning to acknowledge his new role as a house pet.    And now it's Bell, a 16-year veteran with the Inglewood police who was recently  promoted from an officer in the K-9 Corps to a sergeant in the patrol division,  who has the adjusting to do.    Bell and his four-legged partner were virtually inseparable over the last six  years. They worked together all day, worked out together on the beach on  weekends, and on Sunday Welz would sit patiently in the back of the church.    ""He's been a real steady portion of my life,"" Bell said. ""I've told a lot of  things to him I wouldn't tell another human being. . . . Who knows? Maybe I'll  try to sneak him into the office.""      Photo, Officer Dean Young gives pizza to Welz, who assisted in more than 1,000  arrests in career with the Inglewood Police. ""He's been beaten, kicked and shot  at,"" handler Sgt. John Bell said. ALAN HAGMAN / Los Angeles Times      Profile    "

The doctrine began to assume its larger proportions on April 28, 1990, when a  team of Libyan ""marshals"" was detained on arrival at Los Angeles Airport; on  their arrest, the armed Libyans brandished subpoenas demanding that former  President Ronald Reagan stand trial in Tripoli for the murder of Col. Moammar  Kadafi's daughter during the U.S. bombing raid on Kadafi's tent in 1986. Kadafi  was invoking Long Arm, which he smirkingly called the Bush Doctrine, and its  Sauce-for-the-Goose Corollary, for which he claimed the sanction of  international law.    The White House promptly issued a statement pointing out that the Libyan  indictment had not been properly drawn, and that, moreover, a statute of  limitations applied to bombing raids and other acts of regrettable violence  launched before Dec. 31, 1989.    The White House added that the choice of President James Monroe's birthday for  Libya's act of war was an obvious provocation. Kadafi responded angrily that  the well-known Sinatra Doctrine enabled every sovereign state to enforce its  own law by its own long arm and that, in any event, the actual charge against  Reagan was nothing more than involuntary manslaughter, for which the maximum  penalty is only five years of tent arrest.    Kadafi backed down and Washington relaxed -- until Beijing's India incursion of  May 1, 1990, aiming to bring the Dalai Lama to trial on charges of  destabilizing the Tibetan sector of China's sovereign territory. India resisted  successfully, but the Chinese further offended the White House by invoking what  they called the K'ang Hsi Doctrine after the Chinese emperor who had absorbed  Tibet into China in 1720. To demonstrate its displeasure, the Administration  announced its intention to disconnect all coffee-makers on American  fighter-bombers leased to Beijing for a period of not less than 90 days.

The newspaper said the refinery in north central Iraq would reach its full capacity output of 200,000 barrels a day by the end of May after some of its installations were almost totally destroyed in the Gulf war. Allied commanders said they had destroyed 80 per cent of Iraq's oil refining capacity in the Gulf war although this figure was questioned. The Baiji refinery should be producing 100,000 litres of petrol, 3.5m litres of jet fuel and 4.5m litres of diesel by next week, the newspaper said. Almost all oil products are rationed although the Iraqi news agency said this week that the country would be able to meet its domestic fuel needs in the next few weeks. Iraqi oil consumption was running at 300,000 b/d before the war. The country remains barred from export by United Nations' sanctions and export pipelines through Turkey and Saudi Arabia are closed. President Saddam Hussein was pictured on Iraqi television on Sunday at the Daura oil refinery near Baghdad inspecting reconstruction.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Karim: ""Rabah Kebir Persona Non Grata in  Germany""]    [Text] According to a statement issued yesterday in Bonn,  Rabah Kebir will be forbidden to engage in any political  activity on German soil. The German foreign minister announced  that Kebir had made public statements about Algerian political  matters in a manner conflicting with the foreign policy of the  German Federal Republic and endangering Germany's interests.    The German Foreign Ministry statement added that the  situation in Algeria was disturbing. Many assassinations of  foreigners had been reported. The danger to foreigners in  Algeria, continued the statement, had real effects on German  citizens.    The German Foreign Ministry indicated that Kebir had  requested political asylum some time ago. The declaration  forbidding him to engage in political activity on German soil  follows the statement that AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE carried quoting  from a close associate of Kebir, the head of the FIS' [Islamic  Salvation Front] provisional executive body overseas. The  statement, made in the name of this body, announced that in the  period between 26 and 31 January, 45 persons had been killed by  armed groups in Algeria. The source close to Kebir said that the  executive body was announcing these assassinations but not  claiming credit for them.    The announcement forbidding Kebir to engage in his political  activities, including contacts with FIS partisans and statements  to the press, will be made by the interior minister of the state  of North Rhine-Westphalia, who made the request to the German  federal foreign minister. Kebir has made the state of North  Rhine-Westphalia his headquarters since 6 September of last year.    Last Saturday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl made an appeal  to Europeans in which he indicated that a fundamentalist regime  might come to power and that this would represent an immediate  danger to the Mediterranean basin. Referring to the influence of  the Algerian Islamists, the German chancellor added that the  missiles that Iraq launched against Israel and Saudi Arabia  during the Gulf war could be refurbished and placed in other  countries.    Following these changes in the official German position on  the presence of Algerian Islamists in Germany, German  authorities are expected soon to announce a decision forbidding  Kebir from engaging in political activities. If his request for  political asylum is rejected, he may be asked to leave German  territory. One should bear in mind that his German residence  card has almost expired.    Rabah Kebir, 36 years old, a high school teacher, head of  the  FIS' information committee following the Batna conference in  summer 1991, became the FIS's official spokesman after the  arrest of Abdelkader Hachani. He was placed under house arrest  in the city of Collo after January 1992. He has lived in Germany  since August 1992 with his wife and five children after being  able to leave Algeria in the company of Oussama Abassi. He began  to move politically in November 1992 and requested political  asylum from the German authorities.    Although he has received no response to date, he continues  to  enjoy German laws that allow foreigners to engage in political  activities normally, including making statements to the press.  At the end of May 1993, the special court in Algeria sentenced  him to death in absentia in a case involving the bombing of the  airport. Through Interpol, Algerian authorities presented the  German Federal Republic with a request for his detention.    The German police detained him on 7 June 1993. He was  released three months later, on 6 September 1993. The Munich  court stated that the documents submitted did not prove that  Kebir had participated in the bombing of the airport. Kebir  subsequently chose the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where he  has resided until now.    Perhaps for security reasons, Rabah Kebir has chosen secrecy  during the last three months. His contact with the press now  takes place through one of his close associates. On 17 December,  he emerged to hold a press conference in Bonn, where he  enunciated positions described as ""a positive turn"" in the  position of the overseas FIS leadership regarding the  appointment of President Liamine Zeroual and continued dialogue,  though with conditions.    With the decision to forbid Kebir from political activity,  the EC's appeals to combat violence and terrorism and tighten  the grip on FIS partisans on European soil have gained a  response from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl after an initial  step taken by Charles Pasqua [the French interior minister] last  December.

The explosives, found in a locked apartment at Kausa town in Thane district northeast of Bombay, were probably meant for a second round of attacks on the city, Mr Amareet Singh Samra, the Bombay police chief said. He said the bombers had apparently wanted to trigger a new round of Hindu-Moslem clashes in Bombay, which was swept by communal bloodshed in December and January. Mr Samra said the explosives were traced on information disclosed by one of four key people involved in carrying out the attacks, in which 13 bombs ripped through the port city in the space of two and a half hours on March 12. Police have so far arrested 17 people, including some suspects who have told police how the RDX explosive was smuggled into Bombay, and how they were trained to plant it. Authorities have identified a wealthy Muslim family, the Memons, as key suspects in the case. Some of them are believed to have fled to Karachi in Pakistan. Pakistan said it has been unable to catch the primary suspects because India provided too little information too late.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

OSTROW, Times Staff Writer      WASHINGTON      FBI Director William S. Sessions, citing a 40% increase in violent crimes over  the last decade, Wednesday elevated violent crime to a ""priority"" status for  FBI investigators, a move that will provide greater assistance to state and  local police who handle most such violations.    Making violent crime the sixth of the FBI's priorities also ""will invigorate a  program that has experienced an erosion of funding and manpower in recent  years,"" Sessions said at a press conference. The FBI has jurisdiction over such  violent crimes as kidnaping, extortion, bank robberies and hijackings and --  more recently -- drug-related homicides, police killings and the sexual  exploitation of children.    In the mid-1970s, the FBI began establishing priorities that dictate to what  cases the special agents in charge of its 57 field offices will assign their  investigators. Those priorities have been foreign counterintelligence,  organized crime, white collar crime, drugs and counterterrorism.      Violent Crimes Increasing    ""Additional responsibilities and an increasing violent crime rate have mandated  a revitalization of our efforts,"" Sessions said.    In the field, Sessions' move will mean that ""no longer will an SAC (special  agent in charge) take people from the squad working violent crime to do  something else,"" said one official with experience in running a major field  office.    In supporting state and local law enforcement agencies, Sessions said that he  wants to make greater use of such new tools as automated fingerprint systems,  DNA genetic typing that can identify an individual from skin, blood and other  body fluids at a crime scene, artificial intelligence and behavioral profiling  to help identify suspects.    Sessions noted that President Bush's crime package, sent to Congress last week,  calls for an additional 300 FBI positions at a cost of $19.5 million to help  combat violent crime.      Confirms Gray Probe    Responding to persistent questions at the press conference, Sessions also made  clear for the first time that the Justice Department had authorized the  bureau's investigation of suspected payroll padding in the office of Rep.  William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), an inquiry that became public and threatened  Gray's subsequent election as Democratic whip.    In the investigation of Gray's office, Sessions said that the FBI had followed  its ""guidelines, procedures and policies.""    An FBI spokesman, detailing those policies, said that an investigation of a  member of Congress can be initiated after consultation with the U.S. attorney  for the area. FBI headquarters is notified immediately and it then advises the  Justice Department's public integrity section ""to further ensure adequate  predication"" for the inquiry.    On Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's complaint that he did not know in advance that  two agents from the FBI's Philadelphia field office were going to interview  Gray about the case on Memorial Day, Sessions said that he would not describe  the failure to inform Thornburgh as ""a breakdown.""    ""There may have been a lapse, there may have been some circumstance where  communication was not fully conveyed,"" Sessions said.      Takes Unusual Step    On the eve of the House Democratic Caucus' vote, Thornburgh's executive  assistant, Robert S. Ross, took the unusual step of announcing that Gray was  ""not a target of the investigation.""    The investigation is continuing, and Thornburgh has launched an investigation  of its disclosure.    Asked whether the handling of the Gray investigation indicated that politics  was influencing federal investigations, Sessions -- his voice rising for  emphasis -- responded with ""an absolute resounding no. The bureau is and will  be apolitical. It will not be involved in the pursuing of political objectives  through investigation. That's absolutely critical.""    Thornburgh has said that he did not find anything improper in the  investigation, only in its disclosure. On the subject of terrorism, Sessions  indicated that he is more confident about identifying those responsible for the  bombing of Pan American Flight 103 from London to New York last Dec. 21 than he  is about solving the bombing in San Diego of the van driven by the wife of the  skipper of the U.S. cruiser Vincennes.

OSTROW, Times Staff Writer      WASHINGTON      FBI Director William S. Sessions, citing a 40% increase in violent crimes over  the last decade, Wednesday elevated violent crime to a ""priority"" status for  FBI investigators, a move that will provide greater assistance to state and  local police who handle most such violations.    Making violent crime the sixth of the FBI's priorities also ""will invigorate a  program that has experienced an erosion of funding and manpower in recent  years,"" Sessions said at a press conference. The FBI has jurisdiction over such  violent crimes as kidnaping, extortion, bank robberies and hijackings and --  more recently -- drug-related homicides, police killings and the sexual  exploitation of children.    In the mid-1970s, the FBI began establishing priorities that dictate to what  cases the special agents in charge of its 57 field offices will assign their  investigators. Those priorities have been foreign counterintelligence,  organized crime, white collar crime, drugs and counterterrorism.      Violent Crimes Increasing    ""Additional responsibilities and an increasing violent crime rate have mandated  a revitalization of our efforts,"" Sessions said.    In the field, Sessions' move will mean that ""no longer will an SAC (special  agent in charge) take people from the squad working violent crime to do  something else,"" said one official with experience in running a major field  office.    In supporting state and local law enforcement agencies, Sessions said that he  wants to make greater use of such new tools as automated fingerprint systems,  DNA genetic typing that can identify an individual from skin, blood and other  body fluids at a crime scene, artificial intelligence and behavioral profiling  to help identify suspects.    Sessions noted that President Bush's crime package, sent to Congress last week,  calls for an additional 300 FBI positions at a cost of $19.5 million to help  combat violent crime.      Confirms Gray Probe    Responding to persistent questions at the press conference, Sessions also made  clear for the first time that the Justice Department had authorized the  bureau's investigation of suspected payroll padding in the office of Rep.  William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), an inquiry that became public and threatened  Gray's subsequent election as Democratic whip.    In the investigation of Gray's office, Sessions said that the FBI had followed  its ""guidelines, procedures and policies.""    An FBI spokesman, detailing those policies, said that an investigation of a  member of Congress can be initiated after consultation with the U.S. attorney  for the area. FBI headquarters is notified immediately and it then advises the  Justice Department's public integrity section ""to further ensure adequate  predication"" for the inquiry.    On Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's complaint that he did not know in advance that  two agents from the FBI's Philadelphia field office were going to interview  Gray about the case on Memorial Day, Sessions said that he would not describe  the failure to inform Thornburgh as ""a breakdown.""    ""There may have been a lapse, there may have been some circumstance where  communication was not fully conveyed,"" Sessions said.      Takes Unusual Step    On the eve of the House Democratic Caucus' vote, Thornburgh's executive  assistant, Robert S. Ross, took the unusual step of announcing that Gray was  ""not a target of the investigation.""    The investigation is continuing, and Thornburgh has launched an investigation  of its disclosure.    Asked whether the handling of the Gray investigation indicated that politics  was influencing federal investigations, Sessions -- his voice rising for  emphasis -- responded with ""an absolute resounding no. The bureau is and will  be apolitical. It will not be involved in the pursuing of political objectives  through investigation. That's absolutely critical.""    Thornburgh has said that he did not find anything improper in the  investigation, only in its disclosure. On the subject of terrorism, Sessions  indicated that he is more confident about identifying those responsible for the  bombing of Pan American Flight 103 from London to New York last Dec. 21 than he  is about solving the bombing in San Diego of the van driven by the wife of the  skipper of the U.S. cruiser Vincennes.    On the Vincennes inquiry, Sessions said that the dispatch of 15 agents to San  Diego earlier this month did not signal that the investigation is stymied. But  he added: ""I can't express with strong confidence that we will solve that  particular case, but I hope we are able to do it.""

Gorbachev  gathered the embattled leadership of the Warsaw Pact in Moscow. The Soviet  government issued a unilateral declaration that called the invasion of  Czechoslovakia by Soviet Bloc troops in 1968 both ""unfounded"" and ""erroneous.""  Then Gorbachev joined with leaders from Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany and  Poland (which participated in the invasion) to admit that their actions were  ""an interference in (the) internal affairs of Czechoslovakia and should be  condemned.""    The Brezhnev doctrine, which originated as Moscow's legal justification for the  invasion, is dead. For two decades, this notorious doctrine sought to justify  Soviet intervention in socialist countries to preserve Communist rule. The  declarations in Moscow were not merely words of contrition that bury the  Brezhnev doctrine; the deeds of the Warsaw Pact also reflect a new era of  nonintervention. In late October, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze appeared before the Supreme Soviet and owned up to two other  illegal acts. He cited United Nations condemnations of the Soviet war in  Afghanistan and asked, ""what other evidence did we need to realize that we had  set ourselves against all humanity, violated norms of behavior, ignored  universal human values?"" (Unfortunately, the continued flow of Soviet and U.S.  arms to warring parties in Afghanistan long after Soviet troops have withdrawn  leaves this particular example of aggression unresolved.) And he conceded that  the Krasnoyarsk radar installation ""the size of an Egyptian pyramid"" was ""a  clear violation"" of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the United States.  This statement contradicted years of official Soviet denials of the illegality  of the radar. At a time when differing interpretations of the ABM Treaty  continue to threaten the success of strategic arms control talks, the Soviet  admission takes one issue off the table.    Such testimony reminds us that the law of nations is no fiction; it is a  driving force behind the revolutionary changes occurring in the old socialist  bloc. The standards erected by international law increasingly help define the  credibility of both old and new political leaders there. That some officials  are courageous enough to expose and admit illegal behavior fortunately defies  historical precedent.    The U.S. government frequently condemns the illegal conduct of other nations.  But humility is not Washington's strong suit. Neither the Bush Administration  nor Congress is likely to acknowledge any illegal conduct by the United States  during or after the Cold War.

The devastating bombing campaign, kept  secret from Congress and the American public for years by the Nixon  Administration, remains obscured by a public record of hopelessly flawed  legalistic excuses.    Some of the covert actions undertaken with U.S. help in Latin America  challenged international norms. These acts included assistance in overthrowing  governments in Guatemala and Chile, mining harbors and bombing economic targets  in Nicaragua and trying to assassinate political leaders.

The ring employed ""shoppers,"" who would each charge $1,000 to $8,000 on  fraudulent credit cards, either in merchandise or cash withdrawals from  automated teller machines.    Some of the shoppers went on weekend spending sprees to such vacation spots as  Puerto Rico and Las Vegas, authorities said. Some held regular jobs and  moonlighted for the fraud ring.    Cards also were used by robbers, drug traffickers and other criminals to buy  airline tickets or hotel rooms when they traveled to other cities, Secret  Service officials said during a Los Angeles news conference.    ""This is the first time the (Secret) Service has seen such widespread use of  stolen and altered credit cards to facilitate violent crimes nationwide,"" said  Secret Service Director John R. Simpson, who was joined by Dist. Atty. Ira  Reiner and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates in announcing the arrests.    Simpson said it was one of the largest credit-card scam operations his agents  have encountered.    The sophisticated ring employed Los Angeles street gang members, from both the  rival Crips and Bloods factions, to run errands. Ringleaders referred to the  gang members as ""the South-Central labor pool,"" one agent said.    The cards were obtained from an operative working in an Orange County plant  that produces blank credit cards. The operative stole hundreds, perhaps  thousands, of blank cards from the DataCard Corp. in Buena Park that were going  to be destroyed because of imperfections, Reiner said.    Another operative worked at one of the nation's largest credit bureaus, TRW  Credit Data Division in Orange. She allegedly ferried out credit histories so  that the ring could imprint the cards with the names and numbers of active  credit-card holders.    Other names were obtained by more conventional means, such as fishing  carbon-paper imprints of credit-card purchases out of trash cans at rental-car  agencies, said Richard J. Griffin, head of the Secret Service office in Los  Angeles.    All of the suspects, including three alleged ringleaders, were arrested Monday  night and early Tuesday by Secret Service agents after their indictment by the  Los Angeles County Grand Jury.    Among those arrested were Michael Smyer and Lydell Gordon, both of Los Angeles,  who were being held in lieu of $1-million bail each. They were arraigned  Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court on charges that included conspiracy to  commit grand theft and forgery of a credit card.    The names of the other suspects were not disclosed pending their arraignments.    Agents displayed stacks of blank American Express cards, credit-card embossing  equipment, drugs, guns and $18,000 in cash that were seized during the arrests  and over the course of the 16-month investigation.    Reiner said the 40-count indictment was the first obtained under provisions of  Proposition 115, the so-called ""Speedy Trial Act"" passed by California voters  on June 5. He credited the measure with speeding up the grand jury process,  allowing his prosecutors to obtain indictments after 11 hours of testimony in a  case that previously would have required a three-month preliminary hearing.    The wide-ranging investigation, which officials hailed as a model example of  cooperation between federal and local law enforcement, stemmed from a 1988  holdup in Cincinnati, Ohio, and subsequent use of fraudulent credit cards.    The ring used a variety of credit cards, although American Express and Bank of  America suffered the heaviest losses from the operation -- a combined loss of  about $1 million, authorities said.    Besides the 10 ring members who were indicted, another 50 suspects who  allegedly used the stolen cards also were arrested over the course of the  investigation on various charges.    Both TRW and DataCard officials say they fired the employees they believed  involved with the ring and cooperated in the investigation. A DataCard security  official said the company, one of the largest makers of blank credit cards, has  tightened procedures that account for all the cards it produces. He said the  company has systems to track flawed cards that are destined for disposal.      Photo, Blank and cut-up American Express cards are among evidence displayed by  authorities.

0,FT922-15449 ,"FT922-15449 _AN-CDABOADMFT 920401   FT  01 APR 92 / UN votes for Libya sanctionsfrom April 15      By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS   THE United Nations Security Council last night voted for a showdown with Libya - deciding to impose sanctions from April 15 unless it hands over the two alleged Lockerbie bombers. Ten countries including Britain, the US, France and Russia backed the punitive measures, but as many as five others, among them China and India, abstained. Libyan television said the decision was 'unjust and unfair'. Libya's ambassador to the UN, Mr Ali Elhouderi, said earlier he feared the UN move was paving the way for new air attacks on Libya as in 1986. The sanctions will mean that all Libya's air links will be cut off, arms sales to the Libyans will be banned and Libyan embassy staff around the world will have to be cut. But the UN move will not mean an oil boycott or block most other trade with Libya, although there will be a ban on shipment of aircraft and parts to the Libyans. This is only the fourth time that the Security Council has imposed sanctions, the earlier cases being against Rhodesia, South Africa and, most recently, Iraq. The relatively large number of abstentions in the 15-member Security Council reflected the view that western powers were in too much of a hurry and ought to wait for an interim ruling by the International Court at The Hague. The court is considering a complaint brought by Libya against the US and Britain. Apart from China and India, the other abstainers were Morocco, Zimbabwe and Cape Verde. India and Zimbabwe indicated most UN members, being Third World states, were probably against the UN resolution. Zimbabwe's ambassador said any idea that international law could be made by majority decision of the Security Council could damage the UN. Sir David Hannay, the UK delegate, stressed that if Libya handed over the two for trial in the US or Britain, sanctions would be unnecessary. Libya will still have until April 15 to hand over the two men, accused of masterminding the bombing of the Pan Am jet that exploded over Lockerbie in Scotland in December 1988 with the loss of 270 lives. The UN is also demanding that Libya co-operate with an investigation into the bombing of a French UTA jet over Niger in September 1989, in which 171 people were killed. In a warning to the Libyans, Sir David Hannay said any restraint on foreign nationals who wished to leave Libya would be regarded 'with the utmost seriousness'. The Foreign Office in London, echoing reports from European embassies in Tripoli, said several people had been refused exit visas in the last 10 days. But Mr Elhouderi denied Libya was holding foreigners against their will. 'It is truly a baseless allegation,' he said. Under last night's resolution, Tripoli is required to cease all terrorist action and demonstrate its renunciation. Britain may therefore be able to demand details of IRA agents suspected of having received training in Libya. Tony Walker adds from Cairo: Traffic across Egypt's remote western border with Libya is expected to increase after the imposition of the UN ban on aviation links. Shipping from Egyptian ports is also likely to benefit from the air embargo. Others among Libya's neighbours who are also certain to experience a jump in transit traffic include Tunisia, which shares a land border, and Malta. Col Gadaffi's recent threat, in an interview with the French weekly Figaro magazine, that he would refuse to do business with 'hostile' countries, such as France, indicates Libya will endeavour to be more selective in its choice of trading partners.

The country also announced the arrest of a Chinese reporter from a Hong Kong newspaper on charges of 'espionage regarding state secrets on banking'. An unspecified number of alleged conspirators were arrested in the case involving Mr Xi Yang of Ming Pao daily, the Xinhua news agency said. A Ming Pao editor in Hong Kong called for Mr Xi's release. High publicity surrounding the executions and the apparently unrelated arrests indicated they were part of top-level campaigns to bring order to the chaotic and primitive financial sector and to crack down on corruption. Mr Jiang Zemin, Communist party chief, recently targeted corruption as a 'virus' that if not checked could destroy Chinese socialism. The People's Supreme Court rejected appeals from the financial workers, mostly accountants in their 20s and 30s and including one woman, and ordered them executed. 'These people lusted for profits, were very bold and ran wild,' Mr Liu Jiachen, court vice-president, was quoted by state radio as saying. He called their bounty 'extraordinarily large. They took advantage of the poor management of their banks,' he said. The largest case involved theft of Yn33m (Pounds 3.7m) by five defendants.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.

The NDLEA said in a statement made available in Lagos Wednesday  [20 April] that the figure did not include the massive haul of a  special high grade heroin of 248.3 kilogrammes imported from  Bangkok, Thailand. The drug was seized in December from  businessman Joe Brown Akubueze, who was jailed 25 years early in  1994 for the offence.    The statement said that the number of arrests in 1993 far  outstripped the figures from the previous years. It said  7461.744 kilogrammes of marijuana were seized while the  quantities for cocaine and heroin accounted were 1308.6697 and  39.2862 kilogrammes.

The Syrians believe  that any Jordanian pressure on Tripoli in this connection would  weaken the latter's position in the worsening Lockerbie crisis.  At any rate, it seems that Jordan is trying to identify the  clues to this issue outside Jordanian territory, as the  information available has not indicated that Jordanian security  services have taken any actions against members of the  Fatah-Revolutionary Council or made any arrests in this  connection. It seems that it is seeking to get hold of all  clues in light of the investigations with those suspected of  carrying out the assassination operation in question in Lebanon,  and to determine whether they have any link with members of this  organization in Jordan.

At a joint news conference in the White House the US leader offered to be a 'full partner in renewed peace talks. . . I am convinced that we share a common vision of a more peaceful Middle East.' He believed 'there is reason to believe we can make real headway.' The two men had earlier discussed a US proposal for the peace talks to resume on April 20 in Washington. Some Arab diplomats have expressed fears that Mr Clinton might soften the approach followed by former President George Bush, who exerted pressure on Israel to comply with US wishes. However, Mr Clinton assured Mr Mubarak that the US would not not tilt towards Israel, administration officials said. The Egyptian leader sought to counter the damage that violent incidents by Moslem fundamentalists have had on his country's tourist trade, declaring that Egypt was not in danger. Mr Mubarak also said yesterday that Egypt had 'no definite information' on the bombing on February 26 of the World Trade Centre in New York. In an interview published on Monday, he claimed that the Egyptian intelligence services had supplied the US with general information that might have prevented the blast.

By LANCE IGNON and JIM HERRON ZAMORA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      NEW YORK      More than 250 people were arrested Monday during environmental protests on Wall  Street and in the financial district of San Francisco.    At least 11 people, including seven police officers, received minor injuries.    Hundreds of demonstrators converged on the New York Stock Exchange and the  Pacific Stock Exchange chanting slogans such as ""Wall Street kills,"" and  complaining that corporations had turned Earth Day into a marketing tool  without doing enough to protect the environment.    The demonstrations were organized by a nationwide coalition of environmental  organizations, including Earth First!, the Clamshell Alliance and the Youth  Greens.    In San Francisco, police at the Pacific Stock Exchange were pelted with rocks,  eggs, golf balls and sharpened pieces of metal, San Francisco Police spokesman  David Ambrose said.    A scuffle ensued when police tried to make arrests. The windshield of a police  car was broken and several people were arrested on charges of assaulting a  police officer. The protesters then marched through the financial district,  smashing windows at the Bank of America and turning over several news racks.    The New York protest sparked no major violence, although some protesters  overturned trash bins. A spokesman for Earth Day Wall Street Action said one  protester's arm was broken, although this could not be confirmed.    Despite the number of protesters, which reached at least 700 in New York and  500 in San Francisco, securities trading was not affected. Groups in both  cities had vowed to close the financial centers.    ""Except for arriving at work at little early, it was a normal day inside the  building,"" said Richard S. Torrenzano, senior vice president of the New York  Stock Exchange.    Howard Hawkins, a member of Clamshell Alliance and the Left Green Network, said  the protests were meant to counter what he called the corporate co-opting of  Earth Day, the worldwide environmental celebration held on Sunday. Many  corporations helped sponsor events.    ""What (corporations) are doing is using the environmental (movement) as a  marketing tool,"" Hawkins said. ""Earth Day missed the boat.

In San Francisco, 49 demonstrators were arrested and two police officers were  treated for minor injuries.    Nine minor injuries, including five to police officers, were reported in New  York. Up to 500 police officers on foot, horseback and motorcycle arrested 204  demonstrators.    The demonstrations took on a carnival atmosphere at times as some protesters  marched in costumes: a clown, Moses, bears and ""mutants"" covered with toxic  waste or aerosol cans. Walking through the concrete canyons of the Wall Street  district, they chanted ""corporate greed has to go,"" ""people over profits"" and  ""Wall Street kills.""    Both actions began at about 6:30 a.m. in their respective time zones.    In San Francisco, the protest kicked off with about 100 people trying to block  entrance to the Pacific Stock Exchange. The confrontation turned to violence  when some people started throwing objects at police after refusing to disperse.    Several people were arrested after they allegedly tried to prevent police from  making arrests and then attempted to free a demonstrator from the police,  police spokesman Ambrose said.    Dunifer and other organizers criticized the use of violence by some protesters.  The crowd rallied peacefully at Justin Herman Plaza, Ambrose said.

This drugs haul from a ship in the South China Sea was the  largest since the founding of New China in 1949.    Seven alleged drug smugglers, with Thailand and Hong Kong  passports, were arrested on board a ship of unidentified  nationality. Also arrested were eight people from the mainland  of China who were at the scene in boats, allegedly to receive  the smuggled drugs. The drugs seized were in 51 boxes.    Details of the haul and the arrests were given here today by  a spokesman of the Department of Public Security of the  Guangdong Provincial Government.    On April 21, police of Guangdong Provincial Frontier Defence  heard that an international drug smuggling ship was going to  hand over drugs to smugglers in boats from the mainland of China  the following day. They pursued the ship and boats for more  than one hour and captured all the drugs and the drug smugglers.    Investigations showed that the drugs came from a country in  Southeast Asia. Further investigations are going on.     "

Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.), Rep. Dick Sweat (D-N.H.), and  Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) are expected to hold a  Taipei-Washington, D.C., teleconference with the victims'  relatives, an association spokesman said.

The spokesman said that the conference will probably take  place on Saturday, one day before a Taiwan delegation is  scheduled to leave for Mainland China for a two-week visit to  find out more about the crime.    The spokesman said that the congressmen would ask questions  about whether the relatives were under house arrests when they  went to Zhejiang to identify the charred bodies, the facts about  mainland authorities prohibiting newsmen from approaching the  boat, and about the mainland performing autopsies before the  arrival of the relatives.

Today, the villagers smile and welcome foreign visitors, but the older ones  still wonder what they did to deserve the terror that rained from the skies  between 1964 and 1973.    The United States attacked Ban Dong Nai during the war because the clay track  was part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the network of jungle paths through eastern  Laos and Cambodia that North Vietnam used to move men and supplies into South  Vietnam.    Not far across the Vietnamese frontier is the former U.S. base at Khe San,  which Gen. William C. Westmoreland called the key to stopping full-scale  infiltration from the trail. U.S. Marines held it during a 1968 siege that cost  the lives of about 500 Americans and 10,000 Vietnamese.    The Ho Chi Minh Trail was the main target of America's ""secret war"" in Laos,  which involved 242,000 bombing sorties in 1969 alone. More than 2 million tons  of bombs were dropped on Laos altogether, more than U.S. forces used in all of  World War II.    Lahoun Maprayvong, a former guerrilla now an administrator in Tchepone town,  recalled that first day of bombing, during a Buddhist festival in 1964.    ""We were warned, but we just didn't know what to expect,"" he said. The  bombardment grew steadily worse. The planes came every day for nine years,  sometimes four or five times a day and also at night.    Lahoun said the villagers were most afraid of the huge B-52 bombers the United  States began using extensively in 1967.    ""They flew so high you couldn't see them, so there was no warning,"" he said.  ""They dropped bombs in line -- Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! -- like that. If you were  next in line, then that was it.""    Each B-52 dropped 30 tons of bombs in ""boxes"" half a mile wide and 2 miles  long. They left permanent craters.    ""When they bombed like that, people ran away to the mountains to live in  caves,"" Lahoun said. ""Some years, we had to change places five times. When we  came back, there was nothing left.""    Ban Dong Nai and Tchepone were gone by 1973.    Noi, who was a young girl in the 1960s, said her father was killed in one  attack. ""I just don't understand why the Americans did what they did. You  couldn't escape the bombs,"" she said.    Khamlai was in her twenties in 1968, when she and her younger brother, walking  to a rice field, both stepped on American mines.    She looked down at the ugly, metal-and-rubber left leg she has worn for 22  years, and said: ""Can you tell me how to make it more beautiful?""    Her brother lost both legs.    People along the trail recalled day after day of napalm attacks. Lahoun said  that some of them still suffer from injuries caused by napalm and phosphorous  bombs. Many hillsides stripped by chemical defoliants are still barren.    After South Vietnam's unsuccessful attack on the trail in 1971, all the trees  and bushes were burned away and the road was jammed with the wreckage of tanks,  helicopters and guns, said Phou Wattana, a district official and former  guerrilla.    Villagers pointed out the hulk of one American-made tank and chopped away the  long grass to uncover an artillery piece. Children played near piles of rusty  shells and bombs.    ""They're only dangerous if you put them in the fire,"" a policeman said with a  shrug.    Xoun, an old man who stays home from the rice paddies to tend the children of  Ban Dong Nai, used a machete to uncover unexploded 250-pound and 500-pound  bombs.    Many bomb craters remain in and around the village, and Xoun said that  thousands of small, unexploded antipersonnel bombs remain to kill and maim  farmers.    ""When the planes came, we had to go and live in the forest for many years,"" he  said.    ""As you can see, we are used to living peacefully around here.

The death of a 21-year-old woman is also involved in the case.    The indictment issued Thursday alleges that the group conspired to manufacture  800 pounds of methamphetamine at three clandestine laboratories throughout the  county.    Five of the group are already in custody on separate charges, while the  remaining five are still at-large, Assistant U.S. Atty. D. Thomas Ferraro said.      Operation Crankcase    The drug lab operation was among the biggest encountered by authorities in the  investigation, dubbed Operation Crankcase, which resulted in the arrests of 100  people March 19. Twenty-three meth labs in San Diego County were shut down in  the massive sweep, which involved about 350 officers from every law enforcement  agency in the county.    The indictment Thursday was based on evidence gathered during the operation of  Triple Neck Scientific Laboratory, a privately owned company that assisted the  Drug Enforcement Administration in investigating the purchase of chemicals and  equipment used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, Ferraro said.    The investigation is still considered active because more arrests stemming from  Triple Neck's operation are possible, Ferraro said.    The ""Walters Organization,"" as the group indicted Thursday was known, was  allegedly headed by Martin Edward Walters, 21, of Mira Mesa. He is in County  Jail on charges that include kidnaping and murder.      Other Charges    The indictment also charges Martin Edward Walters, his brother Vincent, and  three other men who allegedly belong to the organization with kidnaping three  people at gunpoint in an effort to obtain methamphetamine stolen from the  group.    In another dimension of the case, the San Diego County district attorney's  office has filed additional kidnaping and murder charges in connection with the  same incident, which resulted in the death last September of Kristine Reyes,  21. Reyes was killed after she; her boyfriend, Edward Michael Provencio, and an  unnamed friend were allegedly abducted by Juan Antonio Lopez, one of the five  men charged in the indictment.    Reyes was found dead in a vacant El Cajon house on Sept. 30, five days after  her kidnaping. She died after breathing fumes from a toxic chemical placed on a  gag covering her mouth. Lopez was arrested in connection with her death in  December, and he remains in custody.    Authorities believe the five men were present and participated in Reyes' death.    Ferraro said police were close to arresting Martin Edward Walters on drug  charges when the murder occurred. ""(Reyes' death) really was an unfortunate  thing,"" Ferraro said.    Martin Edward Walters ""had already involved himself with Triple Neck and had  sold to undercover officers prior to (Reyes') death,"" Ferraro said.      Pipe Bomb Factory    A pipe bomb factory was found at Martin Edward Walters' San Diego residence  when investigators raided a suspected meth lab in 1987, Ferraro said.    Those charged with kidnaping along with Martin Edward Walters, Vincent and  Lopez are Glenn Andrew Arnold, 22, and Michael (Satin) Lee Moore, 20. The five  were also indicted on the drug charges. Vincent and Moore remain at-large.    Also indicted for the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine were Paul  Elza Walters III, 25, and Michell Denise Walters, 18, who are in custody; Kirk  (Troll) Bush, 21; Robert Lee Hall III, 26, and Steven (Barney) Kelly Barnett,  28, who are at large.    On May 26, a federal grand jury returned indictments against four other people  who had purchased chemicals and equipment from Triple Neck. In that indictment,  the four men, identified as Mexican citizens, are charged with the manufacture  of 9.2 pounds of methamphetamine and with attempting to manufacture an  additional 85 pounds at the time the site was discovered by DEA agents.      July 4, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition      FOR THE RECORD;    SUSPECT NOT AT LARGE AT TIME OF INDICTMENT    In a June 10 story based on information from the U. S. attorney's office in San  Diego, it was reported that Michael Lee Moore was at large at the time of his  indictment by a federal grand jury for the alleged manufacture and distribution  of methamphetamine. Actually, Moore was in San Diego County Jail downtown on  other charges at the time of the indictment.    "," LA061089-0004   68274    June 10, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition    Correction Appended      Metro; Part 2; Page 6; Column 3; Metro Desk      683 words      GRAND JURY INDICTS 10 MORE IN LARGEST U.S. METH LAB STING      By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer      A federal grand jury in San Diego has issued a 14-count indictment charging 10  more people with the manufacture and distribution of methamphetamine in the  aftermath of a nine-month inter-agency sting operation that authorities have  billed as the largest of its kind in U.S. history, officials reported Friday.    The death of a 21-year-old woman is also involved in the case.    The indictment issued Thursday alleges that the group conspired to manufacture  800 pounds of methamphetamine at three clandestine laboratories throughout the  county.    Five of the group are already in custody on separate charges, while the  remaining five are still at-large, Assistant U.S. Atty. D. Thomas Ferraro said.      Operation Crankcase    The drug lab operation was among the biggest encountered by authorities in the  investigation, dubbed Operation Crankcase, which resulted in the arrests of 100  people March 19. Twenty-three meth labs in San Diego County were shut down in  the massive sweep, which involved about 350 officers from every law enforcement  agency in the county.    The indictment Thursday was based on evidence gathered during the operation of  Triple Neck Scientific Laboratory, a privately owned company that assisted the  Drug Enforcement Administration in investigating the purchase of chemicals and  equipment used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, Ferraro said.    The investigation is still considered active because more arrests stemming from  Triple Neck's operation are possible, Ferraro said.    The ""Walters Organization,"" as the group indicted Thursday was known, was  allegedly headed by Martin Edward Walters, 21, of Mira Mesa. He is in County  Jail on charges that include kidnaping and murder.      Other Charges    The indictment also charges Martin Edward Walters, his brother Vincent, and  three other men who allegedly belong to the organization with kidnaping three  people at gunpoint in an effort to obtain methamphetamine stolen from the  group.

ENCOUNTERS LEAVE LOGGERS RESENTFUL.      By MARK A. STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WILLOW CREEK, Calif.      While most fall ballot battles are being fought with salvos of 30-second TV  spots, the fight over the future of the state's forests has been waged this  summer in a tense form of hand-to-hand campaign combat.    With potentially drastic reforms of state logging regulations going before  voters in Proposition 130, timber companies felled trees as quickly as their  controversial harvest plans were approved by state officials.    A small band of students, retirees and full-time environmental activists  organized by the radical Earth First! movement responded by trying to inhibit  the harvest by using civil disobedience, backwoods confrontation and  conventional protest.    Together, the activities were known as ""Redwood Summer,"" in honor of the  ""Freedom Summer"" civil rights movement of the early 1960s.    With equal measures of guerrilla theater and guerrilla war, Redwood Summer saw  as few as one and as many as 1,500 activists dress as owls and sing protest  songs, chain themselves to heavy equipment and block logging roads, suspend  themselves by wires above state highways and stand between angry tree fallers  and ancient redwoods.    As Redwood Summer draws to a close this weekend with a two-day rally and  ""Redwoodstock"" concert along the Eel River south of Eureka, the early dreams of  stopping the timber industry clearly failed to materialize.    But participants believe they slowed the rate of harvest, drew attention to  timber issues in vote-rich Southern California -- and even swayed some local  loggers to support reforms that would ban the current practice of ""mining  forests"" by cutting down old trees as much as twice as fast as new ones can  take their place.    ""The actual small number of trees that we saved by standing in front of them is  not significant,"" said activist Paul Chapman, 21, of New York. ""It's nice and  sentimental, but I don't think in the long run it is as important as what we've  done to raise the issue"" in the minds of Southern Californians, whose numerous  votes ultimately will decide Proposition 130.    ""For a hundred or something years, logging went unnoticed and unchecked, and  they cut down 95% of the ancient redwoods,"" said Chapman, who earned academic  credit at Antioch College in Ohio for participating in the protests. ""Now this  process is not going to go unnoticed. . . . The whole country knows at least  some of what is going on here.""    Industry representatives respond that the demonstrators themselves don't know  what is going on.    ""We're tired of being told how to care for a forest environment by individuals  and groups who have no training nor understanding of modern forestry,"" said  Mary A. Bullwinkel of the Pacific Lumber Co., a target of protesters because it  is the largest private owner of old-growth redwoods and one of the most  vigorous harvesters.    ""Most of us have lived on the North Coast for a number of years,"" she said in a  written statement. ""The summer protesters chose to invade our home and tell us  how to run our lives. We don't like that and are resentful.""    The activists, who have come from as far as Wisconsin and Ohio, frequently cite  a report from the California Department of Forestry that, in the 1980s, old  trees were cut down in Humboldt and Mendocino counties -- the prime redwood  counties -- at a rate two to three times as fast as new trees could grow to  replace them.    The logging industry claims that recent concern over protecting rare and  endangered species, like the northern spotted owl, has slowed the harvest and  thrown hundreds of people out of work. But the evidence is mixed.    Harvests dipped slightly in 1989, but still were the third-highest level in  history, according to the Western Wood Products Assn. California timber tax  revenue, collected on the number of trees felled, increased by about 6.5%  during the most recent 12-month period for which figures are available.    The forestry department also reports that 95% of the estimated original 2  million acres of virgin redwoods have been cut down; of the 100,000 acres that  remain, 80,000 acres are protected in parks and the remainder is in private  hands and available for harvest.    Much of the area cut has sprouted vigorous new redwoods, but biologists  disagree about the value of this ""second growth"" as habitat for such rare and  endangered species like the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet and red tree  vole.    Many of the Redwood Summer actions have focused on saving what old-growth  redwoods remain along the North Coast. With the exception of a small stand in  the hills along the Mendocino coast, cutting generally has been delayed only a  few days by the demonstrators.    Stephanie Lasko, 20, a UC Irvine drama student from Monrovia, said she was  ""very disappointed"" to learn that shortly after she was arrested for  trespassing and briefly jailed, loggers cut a grove of trees she and others had  spent three days hiking into the woods to try to save.    ""I had to ask myself, 'Was it worth arrest?' "" she said after a brief swim in  Madden Creek to escape the blazing late-summer heat that has afflicted the  demonstrators' makeshift camp. ""I didn't want to do a symbolic arrest. I wanted  to stop the cutting. . . . But they cut anyway. They don't care.""    She said her disappointment was especially bitter because the tree fallers she  encountered in the forest were sympathetic to her cause, even as they disagreed  with her tactics.    But not all workers were so friendly. Redwood Summer activists said some  workers threw eggs, spat upon and verbally threatened them. During one action  in the woods, they said some workers threw rocks at them and hit one activist  with an ax handle.    Activists have filed charges with police in several such incidents, but no  arrests have been made.    Timber company representatives and local politicians accuse the activists of  spiking trees, spreading nails on logging roads and sabotaging heavy equipment.  The activists, who required special nonviolence training for all participants,  deny the allegations.    However, there has been dissent in the movement. Two members quit when  activists disrupted a meeting between industry leaders and Humboldt State  University staff. When allowed to speak, activists tried to make a citizen's  arrest of a timber company president. As he fled, Redwood Summer demonstrators  rocked and jumped on his car; when he drove off anyway, they accused him of  trying to run them down.    Of the 146 Redwood Summer-related arrests made in Humboldt County, most were  for trespassing and other nonviolent misdemeanors, the Sheriff's Department  said. Other arrests have been made in Mendocino and in Marin County, where the  Pacific Lumber Co. headquarters is located.    Chris Balz was one of those arrested in Mendocino County. A Michigan native and  Stanford graduate, Balz, 21, joined Redwood Summer because he said regular  protests and political action were not working fast enough to save the  remaining virgin redwoods.    ""I was sick of just demonstrating. I wanted to try direct action,"" said Balz,  who delayed taking a job at an organic farm to join the anti-logging actions.  ""When you feel about this the way we do, it's not enough to say, 'This is my  big political act, holding a sign and getting spat on.' You want to stand in  front of the chain saws.""

Naturally, mention was made -- mainly appreciatively --  about  bilateral relations and the situation of the Hungarian minority  in Ukraine.

By Alisa Samuels      Anti-drug crusader Montel Williams joked and laughed with 550 San Pedro  students last week -- and gave them a new set of the three Rs while imploring  them to stay away from drugs.    In addition to reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic, Williams told the ninth-graders  at Dodson Junior High School to learn restraint, responsibility and respect.    ""You better learn respect right now for yourself,"" Williams exhorted the  students. ""If you start respecting yourself -- guess what -- maybe other people  will respect you.""    Williams, who came to the school under the sponsorship of Pepsi-Cola to spread  an anti-drug, improve-yourself message, immediately grabbed the students'  attention when he walked down the center aisle, and he never let their  attention stray.    Dressed in black, his head shaved, Williams used sarcasm and street talk from a  persuasive bag of speaking tricks. He pranced all around the auditorium. He  mugged, pleaded and screamed.    Williams told the boys they were not men just because ""God gifted you with the  equipment to make a baby,"" and he urged the girls to have self-esteem: Don't be  fooled into spending time with a man ""for a piece of plastic, a meal and a  ride.""    Williams, 33, also told the students not to become high school dropouts.    Without an education, he said, their job future would be bleak. ""Hi, welcome to  McDonald's,"" Williams mimicked. ""Can I take your order?""    Pepsi-Cola Co. Los Angeles paid $3,000 for Williams' 90-minute visit. The money  will go to his Denver-based nonprofit organization called Reach the American  Dream, which he founded in 1988 to motivate youngsters to stay in school and  avoid drugs. Williams, who said he receives 12% of the honorariums for his  appearances, has talked to an estimated 1.5 million students across the country  since January, 1988.    In an interview, Williams said he used drugs ""at a time when everyone was doing  drugs"" but realized their danger when he saw what 11 years of heroin did to his  cousin.    Williams, a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve, was invited to speak at Dodson by  Ralph Mays, coordinator of the Long Beach Naval Station's Personal Excellence  Program.

By Alisa Samuels      Anti-drug crusader Montel Williams joked and laughed with 550 San Pedro  students last week -- and gave them a new set of the three Rs while imploring  them to stay away from drugs.    In addition to reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic, Williams told the ninth-graders  at Dodson Junior High School to learn restraint, responsibility and respect.    ""You better learn respect right now for yourself,"" Williams exhorted the  students. ""If you start respecting yourself -- guess what -- maybe other people  will respect you.""    Williams, who came to the school under the sponsorship of Pepsi-Cola to spread  an anti-drug, improve-yourself message, immediately grabbed the students'  attention when he walked down the center aisle, and he never let their  attention stray.    Dressed in black, his head shaved, Williams used sarcasm and street talk from a  persuasive bag of speaking tricks. He pranced all around the auditorium. He  mugged, pleaded and screamed.    Williams told the boys they were not men just because ""God gifted you with the  equipment to make a baby,"" and he urged the girls to have self-esteem: Don't be  fooled into spending time with a man ""for a piece of plastic, a meal and a  ride.""    Williams, 33, also told the students not to become high school dropouts.    Without an education, he said, their job future would be bleak. ""Hi, welcome to  McDonald's,"" Williams mimicked. ""Can I take your order?""    Pepsi-Cola Co. Los Angeles paid $3,000 for Williams' 90-minute visit. The money  will go to his Denver-based nonprofit organization called Reach the American  Dream, which he founded in 1988 to motivate youngsters to stay in school and  avoid drugs. Williams, who said he receives 12% of the honorariums for his  appearances, has talked to an estimated 1.5 million students across the country  since January, 1988.    In an interview, Williams said he used drugs ""at a time when everyone was doing  drugs"" but realized their danger when he saw what 11 years of heroin did to his  cousin.    Williams, a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve, was invited to speak at Dodson by  Ralph Mays, coordinator of the Long Beach Naval Station's Personal Excellence  Program. It adopted Dodson in 1988 as part of a nationwide outreach effort,  which involves the Navy with local community and youth organizations and  emphasizes academics, health and fitness.

The event occurred on Wednesday morning when the peasant  leaders were taken away in a military Jeep in Chiapas State,  where a guerrilla uprising against the government has been under  way for six days.    Jorge Luna, Central's spokesman, deplored the fact that the  minister failed to establish guarantees for the dialogue he  summoned, adding that the ""government has lost control over the  Army,"" which is ""deciding what should be done in the area  involved in the conflict.""    Luna issued an appeal to prevent a massacre of peasants and  Indians and held the government responsible for the ""tragedy  that afflicts our state and our comrades' safety.    Moreover, 11 organizations that make up the Permanent  Agrarian Congress condemned the arrests and sent a document to  Mexican President Carlos Salinas demanding a political rather  than a military solution to the conflict and urging the rebels  to put down their weapons.

'It stands at zero now,' said Mr Maurizio Zifferero. Mr Zifferero, deputy director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the programme had been rendered harmless both through the efforts of repeated UN inspection teams and by allied bombing during the Gulf war. Mr Zifferero, who is heading the 14th visit to Iraq by UN nuclear inspectors, said: 'We're completing our investigation of the (nuclear) programme and find no evidence of the programme being continued.' He added that the UN teams had searched for evidence that the Iraqis had secret underground nuclear complexes but inspectors found nothing. But IAEA officials in Vienna emphasised that tough UN inspections of Iraq's nuclear-related sites and equipment would continue indefinitely. Officials said some equipment remained to be destroyed under the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire, while inspectors would also want to ensure that Iraq did not covertly resume work on developing its nuclear potential. The IAEA also says it has made no progress in persuading Iraq to reveal either the procurement network which gave it access to highly sensitive nuclear technology, or the identities of foreign experts believed to have advised Iraq on its nuclear programme.

By MARK RIDLEY-THOMAS, Mark Ridley-Thomas is executive director of the Southern  Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles.      By most accounts, the No. 1 crisis facing American cities is drug abuse. ""For  about 75 years,"" writes Howard Moody in the journal Christianity and Crisis,  ""we've been trying to prevent some of our citizens from using, abusing,  importing and selling opiates and euphoriants. So far, the only real effect is  more addicts, more drugs and more murder and mayhem on the 'mean streets' of  our cities and, more recently, in our small towns.""    Over the past few years, there have been about 750,000 drug-related arrests  nationwide. Interestingly, 75% of them were not for dealing and selling, but  for possession. Federal as well as local law-enforcement efforts are largely  aimed at reducing demand. While this is certainly appropriate, failing to  recognize that demand constitutes an unprecedented public-health crisis rather  than a law-enforcement monopoly will only compound current problems. Public  policy on addiction and abuse must be radically refocused. A federal report  fingers street-gang members, often the victims of economic deprivation and  inadequate education, as the entrepreneurs of the underground crack economy.    Members of state and federal courts felt compelled recently to comment that the  overburdened courts should be among the last resorts in the fight against  drugs; they call for much more education, treatment, early intervention and  research. Indeed, this addresses the demand issue in a more effective way. The  punitive approach is too costly and reaps too few positive results.    The issue is particularly sensitive for the California Supreme Court, which  recently ruled against a mother whose child was born addicted to illegal drugs.  With this attempt to protect the child, the court has cleared the way for the  denial of custody to a mother who abuses drugs.    This has far-reaching implications for the health-crisis dimension of drug  abuse, documented by a recent report on infant mortality and low-birth weights.  At a time when infant-mortality rates are declining nationwide, they are  increasing in Los Angeles County. This phenomenon is most apparent among  African American women and is traceable to the rise in crack cocaine addiction  and the shortage of obstetric and prenatal care. The percentage of babies born  weighing less than 5.5 pounds -- a key predictor of mortality and disability --  rose 17% overall and 32% among African American women in the county.    This situation looks even grimmer in view of the paucity of services for  addicted mothers. The possibility of the courts' removing children from  addicted mothers only makes matters more ominous; as many as 2,500 drug-baby  cases could enter Los Angeles-area courts annually. In the rush to criminalize  everything and everyone associated with illicit drug use, Los Angeles could  easily become part of the latest rash of copycat criminal prosecutions of  drug-addicted mothers charged with endangering their fetuses -- three-dozen  women have faced this ordeal nationwide.    For African Americans generally, the problem gets worse because of the  disproportionately low number of treatment centers in the very communities hit  hardest by crack. According to Karen Bass, a physician assistant and clinical  instructor at USC, since 1986, the year of the crack explosion, more than 50%  of the 5,312 crack-related cases in the county involved African Americans.    The bulk of these cases came from the county's Southeast Planning Area, which  had only three community-based treatment centers and one private provider, the  lowest number of all six county regional planning areas.    In light of these conditions, the African American community in Los Angeles has  taken it upon itself to organize against what appears to be an intractable  menace. In an unprecedented two-day conference today and Saturday, every sector  of the community will concentrate on how to confront this crisis with more  conviction, clarity and creativity.    Modeled after the successful Crack Cocaine and the African American Family  Conference in San Francisco last year, this conference hopes to launch an  extensive network of providers, community activists, corporate leaders,  educators, social service agencies, media representatives, elected officials,  parents, ex-users, clergy and law enforcement officials to attack this problem.    Those concerned about one of the most serious crises to face the nation, this  city and the African American community in particular refuse to be resigned to  these miserable conditions and will not rely largely on a punitive approach.  Instead, the call is for a comprehensive approach that rescues this nation from  the catastrophic consequences of prevailing policies and arrests the problem  that has gripped the lives of the guilty and innocent alike.

But, it seems, some of the opposing  factions in that country have not as yet learned from the past  hard experience since they've done it again. A massive bomb  explosion wrecked the headquarters of the Christian Phalange  Party in Beirut yesterday (Monday) as a result of which two  innocent people were killed and dozens of others were injured.    The Christian Phalange Party was responsible for some of  Lebanon's cruellest acts of crime during that country's decade  and half years old civil war that came to a partial end in 1991.  But despite their poor past performance record the bombing, or  the act of planting it, was most unwarranted, a big mistake and  an act of utmost narrow-mindedness.    This latest act of terrorism is bound to breathe new life in  the old and evil religious and factional animus, and trigger a  new round of vengefulness, destruction and killing. What is  most unfortunate is that in this midst a series of most innocent  people, who have nothing to do with the dirty game of politics  and political rivalry, will most likely pay the price.    In yesterday's bombing two people, including a young boy,  who  had nothing to do with the Phalange Party or its activities,  were killed. Also according to the reports, panic-stricken  residents of the buildings around the party headquarters shouted  hysterically as they forced their way through the wreckage to  find their loved ones. Words alone cannot describe the  dastardliness and the cruelness of the act. One has to put  himself in the shoes of those whose loved ones were killed or  maimed by the bombing to grasp the extent of the crime. Why?  Why not put the blind evil of hate behind?    Bomb attacks were frequent during the civil war, and whether  the terrorists like to admit it or not, in Lebanon bombings have  run their course. They are ineffective weapons of persuasion  and can't make a dent in anybody's mind except perhaps foster  hatred -- what Lebanon can and must do without. The bombings  harm everyone including the very people or groups they are  supposed to help. The experience of using a bomb as a means of  furthering one's political goal has not been successful in that  country, and the only thing they have managed to bring about is  to make the whole of Lebanon measurably poorer, irrespective of  one's religious or party affiliation.    Lebanon is like a boat and all the Lebanese people in it  will  either be saved by reaching the shore (of prosperity) or sink  together. One bad thing about terrorist bombings is that they  scare off tourists who bring badly needed foreign exchange into  that country, as well as investments by affluent Lebanese  expatriates or foreign companies. After all who would want to  get caught in the crossfire of bombings?    Not only that the rich Lebanese, who would want to bring  their moneys into Lebanon and invest there, would be scared off,  but also the friendly countries and international lending  institutions which have made their contributions and loans  contingent upon progress in the national reconciliation process,  and in general, Lebanon's peace and stability would be forced to  have a change of mind.    The different Lebanese factions must have learned by now  that  Lebanon should have a place for all legitimate religions and  political religious groups with no exception. And that the  different factions will have to put their human and material  resources together if they want to see Lebanon on a development  course again.    Those responsible for the planting of the bomb at the  Phalange Party headquarters must have not grown enough to  understand the wastefulness and folly of their act. But one  thing is plenty clear: Those behind the act are not just the  enemies of the phalangists but also their own party, clan,  families, and in short the enemies of Lebanon and every  individual in it.    A word of advice for the phalangists: Nothing in life is as  sweet as the exercise of prudence and forgiveness. However,  before they begin thinking about quenching their sense of  revenge by killing innocent people and destroying their  life-earned properties, the phalangists should look into their  own political setup to make sure the bomb was not an inside job  by the ultra-inept who would like to see a resurgence of  religious and factional enmity in Lebanon.

Tourists had left the buses for the Egyptian Museum, one of Cairo's most popular attractions, just 100 yards away. No one claimed responsibility. But it appeared a defiant gesture from Islamic militants who have waged sporadic attacks on tourist targets for much of the past year - considerably hurting Egypt's precious tourism earnings. The explosion took place during the midday rush in Tahrir Square, scene last month of a coffee-shop bombing which killed three. It came in the teeth of tightened security at all Egypt's tourist centres and intensified operations against suspected members of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the underground Islamic group behind most recent attacks. Bus drivers in Tahrir Square said their vehicles had been searched for bombs just 30 minutes before the blast. An explosive device was also defused in a building housing 'foreign experts' in a Cairo suburb, according to the semi-official al-Ahram news agency. The US embassy on Monday called in around 40 members of the US business community to discuss security, following a threat earlier this month by Gama'a al-Islamiyya to attack foreign investments. The embassy stressed only that businesses should step up routine precautions.   Countries:-  EGZ  Egypt, Africa.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

A group from the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) fell into an  ambush Friday evening while attacking government offices with  missile-launchers, according to security officials at  Diyarbakir, responsible for the predominantly Kurdish eastern  regions now under a state of emergency.    In Istanbul, the military wing of the PKK claimed  responsibility for a bomb explosion Saturday morning in Tuzla,  60 kilometres (38 miles) east of the city, which killed five  people and wounded at least 30, according to the latest toll.    All of the dead or wounded were army officer cadets. The  home-made bomb, hidden in a rubbish bin at a railway station,  went off shortly after they were let out for the weekend.    A press statement released later by the pro-Kurdish agency  Kurd-A said the bombing was carried out by an ""underground  revenge group"" of the Popular Army for the Liberation of  Kurdistan.    Some 60 people have been killed this month alone in  separatist skirmishes in the east and southeast of the country,  according to an AFP tally based on official reports. There has  been a total of 11,000 deaths, including 3,300 civilians, since  the start of the Kurdish rebellion in 1984.     "

Authorities suspect it was a terrorist attack.    Sharon Rogers, 50, escaped just seconds before the van burst into flames.    A Justice Department source in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity  said investigators suspect that the bombing was the work of terrorists. The FBI  said it had not ruled out anything.    Mrs. Rogers was uninjured and was taken to a police station, where she was  joined by her husband, Capt. Will Rogers III. Rogers was home at the time of  the blast. Authorities placed the family under protection. Their son was away  at college and was notified.    Mrs. Rogers, a schoolteacher, was driving alone to school and was stopped at a  red light when the bomb exploded at 7:45 a.m. She jumped out as fire quickly  gutted the van.    Rogers was in charge of the San Diego-based Vincennes in July when the  guided-missile cruiser, on duty in the Persian Gulf, mistakenly shot down a  civilian Iran Air Airbus A300 carrying 290 people. Everyone aboard was killed.    No one claimed responsibility for the car bombing.    ""We have no motive at this point in time -- certainly, we have no suspects,""  Tom Hughes, special agent in charge of the local FBI office, told a press  conference. ""We certainly do not rule out the potential retribution to Capt.  Rogers for his . . . command in the Navy.""    The explosive was attached to the white Toyota van's undercarriage, said San  Diego Police Department spokesman Bill Robinson. Fire department officials  agreed. ""The device that was thought to be a pipe bomb was confirmed,"" Robinson  said.    Nevertheless, the FBI was not prepared to confirm the type of explosive device,  the type of explosive material used or how it was detonated, Hughes said.    A message from Rogers was relayed by Cmdr. David Dillon, spokesman for the  Naval Surface Force Pacific Fleet, to which the Vincennes is assigned.    ""I talked with Capt. Rogers and Mrs. Rogers this morning at the police station.  They wanted to pass on that Mrs. Rogers was fine and in good shape.""    Asked about Rogers' reaction to the bombing, Dillon said, ""I think he's just  exasperated by the whole thing. Obviously he's concerned about what happened to  his wife. They just want to get on to other things.""    The Rogerses were being taken to a secret secure place where they will stay  indefinitely, Dillon said. Their son also was under protection.    Dillon said he did not believe any other Vincennes crewmen were being  protected. But the Navy increased its security at the San Diego Navy Base and  other facilities, Navy Chief Craig Huebler said. Other Vincennes crew members  and their families were notified.    The Vincennes returned from its six-month Persian Gulf deployment last October.  It remains in port and Rogers remains its skipper.    As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July 3, Iran Air  Flight 655 appeared on the U.S. warship's high-tech radar. After the plane  failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels, Rogers gave  the order to fire.      Compensation for Victims    The decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew. But what  Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter actually was the Airbus A300. The  Reagan Administration defended the decision but also decided to compensate the  victims' families.    After the shooting, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for an all-out  war against the United States. Speculation after the destruction of a Pan Am  jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December has focused on whether that  bombing was in retaliation for the Vincennes' action. (Immediately after the  plane crashed, a group claimed responsibility. But its claims were discounted  at first.)    In Washington, Navy officials at the Pentagon said they were unaware of any  threats against Rogers or his family, but were awaiting additional reports from  San Diego.

He and fellow workers directed traffic  while their supervisor escorted her to a pickup.    ""She was shaken up, obviously,"" said Lew Davis, another worker.

Arrested Tuesday were Earl James, 28, of Simi Valley; Mark James, 27, of Canoga  Park, and Arturo Betanzos, 19, of Glendale, Simi Valley Police Sgt. Ron Lompart  said. They were in custody on suspicion of grand theft auto.    Lompart said he did not know if Earl and Mark James are related.    The investigation, which began in early April, involved officers from the Simi  Valley and Los Angeles police departments and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department, Lompart said.    Police arrested the men after staking out Earl James' residence in the 2100  block of Bromfield Street, Lompart said.    James was arrested after he drove away in a pickup truck that contained stolen  auto parts, police said. The other two were arrested later inside James' house.    Officers serving a search warrant later discovered two partially stripped  Porsches in James' garage, Lompart said.

0,FT932-12942 ,"FT932-12942 _AN-DDZBRADDFT 930426   FT  26 APR 93 / Leading Article: The bombing of the City   LONDONERS picking their way back to work today through a litter of broken glass should spare a moment's thought for the cities of Northern Ireland, devastated over the past quarter-century on a scale that defies comparison with Saturday's damage in the City. If the Northern Ireland policy supported by all Britain's political parties is correct, it would be quite wrong to waver in it now merely because the buildings being damaged are in Bishopsgate not Belfast. In discovering the vulnerability of London's financial district to large, primitive bombs, the IRA has put its hands on a fresh, powerful weapon. That does not of itself change the nature of the political problem - it merely adds to its urgency. These are the issues of principle. But many people, in the City and elsewhere, will find one practical issue more pressing. How great a threat do two huge explosions in a year pose to London's position as a financial centre? The initial responses of some of the companies most affected by the two giant bomb attacks are reported elsewhere in this issue. On this sort of occasion, however, second thoughts are the ones that count. They will be influenced by a number of factors. First will be the adequacy of the insurance arrangements, underpinned by government guarantee, which were set in place after last year's explosion. The scheme is in its infancy; its enabling legislation has yet to pass through parliament. The government would be right to avoid legalism in its approach to this issue. The important thing is to make sure that the scheme works, and that the state provides the backing necessary for it to do so. Escape route A second factor is the way in which changing modern business practices reduce the impact of this sort of disaster. These days, a large business has its files, its intellectual capital, its soul, stored in its computers. That sounds like an added risk, but in fact it is an escape-route. Providing the computer operators have been taking routine security measures - backing up the files daily, storing copies safely off-site, and so on - the entire system can be rapidly re-created elsewhere. The third factor is less encouraging. The risk is that the bombing will be one more reason to view London as different, risky, a place at the margin, subject to its own unpredictable influences. There are enough of such forces already at work: the EMS debacle, the Taurus collapse, the City's well-known transport problems, the local authority swaps fiasco - even the perennial nuisance of passing through immigration controls at Heathrow. City's advantages Until now, these have been far outweighed by London's countervailing advantages: an open, innovative atmosphere, skilled labour and support services, welcoming authorities, and a cosmopolitan financial tradition. Two bombs are unlikely to tilt the balance. But it is the future risks that matter; and even with extra security precautions, they will clearly be much greater than they seemed 13 months ago. Britain's big financial houses are tied to London; so are the handful of leading international ones. It is the smaller, more footloose institutions - the ones that give the London markets their unique breadth and depth - which can choose to vote with their feet. Ensuring that their decisions come down in London's favour will require tighter security precautions, keener intelligence and better use of police resources. But as important will be a renewed determination to focus on the other aspects of the City's competitiveness. The speed with which the City has coped with the two big disasters of the past year is a tribute to the professionalism of its support staff and the flexibility and commitment of its workforce. Those are among the reasons why London has remained the leading international financial centre. Its chances of retaining that title were high before Saturday's bomb. They remain high now - as long as the government, the City authorities and the leading financial houses display a commitment not just to London's physical security, but also to its future competitive advantage.

The operation also yielded 741 kg of processed ganja, valued  at over Rs 10 lakhs.    The illegal crop, regularly grown in these districts for  many  years, was spread over 205.63 acres in 31 villages.    A NCB official told TOINS [TIMES OF INDIA NEWS SERVICE] that  in many areas it was found that the ganja crop had substituted  cash crops like groundnut and turmeric. In other areas, the crop  was found interspersed with regular crops.    The official added that cultivators who had been growing  ganja over 1,000 acres about ten years ago had now spread out to  about 6,000 acres.    One acre of crop fetched a price of as much as Rs 2 lakhs,  thereby attracting more and more cultivators over the years. NCB  officials found that in many cases local government officials  were colluding with cultivators.    However, no arrests were made during the operations as all  the cultivators had fled.     "
0,FT924-14244 ,"FT924-14244 _AN-CJKABAEEFT 921010   FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel Focus - The Caribbean: Vieques: an odd experience      By JAMES HENDERSON   IT is odd that the finest beaches in Puerto Rico are almost undeveloped, when a quick look at Miami Beach or the San Juan water-front shows that Americans are hardly shy of building on a good strip of Caribbean sand. And yet Vieques, a little-known island off Puerto Rico with some superb beaches, has no skyscraper hotels, no casinos and no Vegas-style entertainment. Instead, Vieques has just a few small guest houses with personable if eccentric managers. The locals spend most of their time playing dominoes and 'liming' (see A-to-Z). And, as well as deserted beaches, Vieques is the site of one of the Caribbean's most extraordinary natural phenomena - a phosphorescent lake. The reason for Vieques' lack of development is that it is mostly owned by the US Navy, which uses it as an ammunition dump and bombing range. In the second world war, Vieques was a fall-back harbour for the Royal Navy in case Britain was captured by the Germans. More recently, the mock invasions of Grenada were staged there and there was a lot of activity during the Gulf War. The navy is an ambivalent presence for the islanders. The nearby islet of Culebra was in the same position until a few years ago when the inhabitants started to organise picnics on the bombing range and the navy withdrew. But for visitors, Vieques is pleasantly undeveloped and peaceful (except for a couple of weeks a year when they are bombing). Nothing could be less military-like than the Casa del Frances, a guest house near Esperanza on Vieques' south coast. It is set in a classic West Indian estate house, wrapped with huge black-and-white chequered verandas, and has fan-cooled rooms set around a courtyard. Poking out of the rampant greenery in the courtyard, metal sculptures strike irregular, satirical poses. The same might be said for the owner, a white-whiskered roustabout by the name of Irving Greenblatt, who is something of a latterday Hemingway. He runs the guest house, which has been called an 'anti-hotel', with co-manager Frank Celeste, a self-appointed sexual chronicler (his latest best-seller: A Cookbook, Sex Manual and History of the Casa). If you can take the ribbing about the British and their food and about their being passionless, then it is an amusing place to stay. If Casa del Frances sounds too rum, you might try the Parador Villa Esperanza, a more traditional hotel on the beachfront. This is the best place from which to arrange a trip to the phosphorescent lake in Mosquito Bay. Visiting the lake is one of the oddest experiences of a lifetime. It is as eerie as it is unlikely: water that glows at the touch, glittering as it slips through your fingers. A motor boat carves an impressive trail in the water, but it is best to go by canoe, preferably on a pitch-black night. As you advance, the wake of the canoe begins to glow and each stroke of the paddle sets off a twirling vortex of green light. Startled fish dart away as you approach, tracing green streaks beneath you. The effect is created by dino-flagellytes - tiny, single-celled protozoa with a plant-like metabolism. When agitated, they undergo a chemical reaction and emit a pinprick of light. Cupped in your hands, they look like distant stars, but if you splash, the overall impression is startlingly bright. Dive and swim and you will leave a trail for 10ft behind you; flick your paddle on the water's surface and you create an arc of light like a waterfall 20ft across. Vieques offers laid-back island life Latin-Caribbean style, and feels remote even though it is just a hop from San Juan (Puerto Rico) and the Virgin Islands.

He has brought in two new faces. Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, up to now Lord Advocate, is to be minister of state and deputy to Mr Ian Lang, the secretary of state. Sir Hector Monro, the MP for Dumfries, is to be one of three parliamentary under-secretaries. Mr Michael Forsyth, formerly minister of state in charge of education and health, is to leave the Scottish Office for the Department of Employment. Lord Strathclyde is also to leave the Scottish Office for the same department. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton and Mr Allan Stewart will remain as parliamentary under-secretaries. Whereas Mr Forsyth is known for his Thatcherite views, and Lord Strathclyde is to the right of the Conservative party, Lord Fraser, who has become well known to the public for his handling of the Lockerbie bombing in 1998, is to the left of many in the Tory party. He is an honorary president of the Tory Reform Group in Scotland, which favours some form of devolved Scottish assembly. Sir Hector, who last held ministerial office at the Environment Department in 1981, has been critical of some of the Thatcherite policies pursued by Mr Forsyth.

The JANA international affairs editor commented on this  sentence, saying: The sentence passed on those four has no  meaning other than the destruction and utmost degradation of a  human being's humanity and his sense of it.    In this regard, the editor referred to what the brother  leader of the revolution said in his address at the final  emergency session of the General People's Congress six years  ago, in which he revealed the repressive methods practiced in  America against human beings and their humanity.    He said that a 50-year-old person in America, for example,  is  given a prison sentence of 100 years. Since this person knows  that he will not live for this period, the sentence is  contemptuous of the human psyche--destroying and degrading  it--and humiliates and harms that person at that moment when the  sentence is passed.    The editor asks where the human rights are that they brag  about in the West if these are their practices that do not give  the slightest value to the human being. At the very least,  these practices can be described as barbaric, savage, and brutal.     "
0,FT922-6059 ,"FT922-6059 _AN-CE0AWAEQFT 920527   FT  27 MAY 92 / Violence sparks fears of summer rioting: The background to clashes with the police in Coventry      By PAUL CHEESERIGHT   POLICE in Coventry are analysing extensive video footage and expect over the next few days to make more arrests after a series of clashes with youths a fortnight ago and over the three days of the holiday weekend. So far, 75 arrests have been made. Outbreaks of violence in Coventry, involving the stoning of police, attacks on fire engines, the use of petrol bombs, arson and stealing, have aroused fears in the Midlands and elsewhere that UK cities may be poised for a lawless summer. Mr Robert Ainsworth, Labour MP for Coventry North-East, where some of the disorder erupted, told the Commons in his maiden speech: 'Our cities are in great danger.' Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, told a recent Birmingham conference: 'Companies cannot afford to ignore the problems of economic regeneration in their local communities.' The Coventry areas where the clashes took place are quite different. Wood End, scene of the first clash of youths with police, is an outer-city council estate of low-rise homes, notorious locally for its decay in human and physical terms. Hillfields, where there was disorder last weekend, is an inner-city area where the unemployment rates are the highest in Coventry and housing conditions are described by the city council as 'the worst in the city'. The two areas have poverty in common. Although half the Hillfields population is black, neither of the series of disturbances pitted one racial community against another. Rather, youths, white in Wood End, both white and black in Hillfields, have been attacking the symbols of authority. To that extent the outbreaks were similar, although they do not seem to have been connected. The gap in time between the series of incidents in Wood End and Hillfields did not suggest that one series set off the other. The catalyst for the disorder at Wood End is clear: the police made one of their periodic forays to stop illegal motorcycle riding through the estate and met resistance. At Hillfields, there was no clear reason for the outbreak, although recently the police have been acting against drugs and prostitution and therefore might be said to have been attacking local vested interests. In both cases the delicacy of the police position was clear. The police had to be seen to be acting against local lawbreaking, if only to dissipate pressures from residents to set up their own vigilante groups. Once attacked, the police, from their own point of view, had to react: there could not be a no-go area where the police writ did not run. If the police came down too hard, though, there was the chance that the antagonism of the youths - gangs of up to 40 in Hillfields and more than double that number in Wood End - would be exacerbated, thus storing up trouble for other warm nights. For the moment the question of authority seems to be resolved. In Hillfields yesterday police patrolling was normal and in Wood End the motorcycling terrorism has abated. Yet the question of why the authority should be contested, why the youths are so antagonistic, remains. Mostly the youths are unemployed or truants. There is an established coincidence between lawlessness on the one hand and unemployment and deprivation on the other. A Coventry City Council report on Wood End last year noted high levels of family breakdown, of child neglect and of debt. More recently the council has stated that in Hillfields, a district which has suffered 'substantial economic decline' and where there is 'limited access to jobs and higher education', the crime levels 'are among the highest in the city'.

By CHRISTOPHER BASSFORD, Christopher Bassford, a former U.S. Army artillery  officer, teaches history at Purdue University. He is the author of Spit-Shine  Syndrome: Organizational Irrationality in the American Field Army (Greenwood,  1988).      If it does become necessary for the United States and allied forces to launch a  military offensive against Iraq, we must hope that the plans being laid by  military commanders are more sensible than some of the dubious schemes being  bandied about in the press. War and politics are inseparable, and it would be  pointless to win this war in a manner that would doom the following peace.    The first faulty notion is the idea of a ""strategic air offensive"" against Iraq  -- wide-ranging bombing that broadly targets Iraqi industry, destroys chemical  weapons facilities and violently upsets the lives of Baghdad's civilians. Some  commentators advocate achieving the same ends with more precisely targeted  commando raids or ""surgical air strikes,"" although such strikes are much more  often imagined than achieved.    The fact is, Iraq has only one industry worth mentioning, and that is oil.  Should we find ourselves in a shooting war, one key purpose of which is to  ensure the flow of petroleum to the world's economy, it is senseless to destroy  that industry. As an economic factor in Iraq's defense, it has already been  shut down by the embargo. As a military factor, the oil fields are irrelevant.  Their destruction would have no impact on Iraqi military fuel supplies during  the short -- though undoubtedly bloody -- conflict.    Bombing chemical plants is even less sensible. There would be no effect on  Iraq's immediately available stocks of chemical munitions, but it would poison  large areas of land (which we would later have to clean up) and horribly kill  hundreds or thousands of Iraqi civilians. (That it might kill Western hostages  as well must not be a factor in our thinking; the responsibility for their  deaths would be Hussein's.)    Bombing Baghdad is a similarly bad idea. We know from long experience that  bombing populations merely makes them identify their own fortunes with those of  the regime under attack. Far more demoralizing would be empty store shelves and  a steady flow of telegrams announcing the deaths of soldier sons and husbands  in nameless losing battles in the desert.    Perhaps the most absurd idea is that of invading Kuwait and ""liberating"" it  without a ""provocative"" invasion of Iraq itself. It seems that the old concept  of burning the village in order to save it is still with us. Any pitched battle  in Kuwait City will leave it a pile of corpse-strewn rubble. This will win us  few friends among the survivors.    The most disturbing thing about this speculation on our military plans is that  it may not be wrong. In Vietnam, we tried to bomb a country that was hardly out  of the Bronze Age back to the Stone Age. That policy bore no positive fruit  because, as with Iraq today, the Vietnamese economy was not the source of the  enemy's weaponry.    Nevertheless, the military might that we are pouring into the Persian Gulf with  such truly impressive speed can still be put to practical offensive use. Saddam  Hussein's regime does have one vital organ that provides a politically and  militarily ideal target: the million-strong Iraqi army.    With one 1 of 17 Iraqis now in uniform, merely supplying the military is a  crushing burden. It is a conventional, armor-heavy force that must concentrate  to be effective, thus offering an ideal target for Western air- and  ground-based firepower. It will be deprived of air support within a few days of  the outbreak of war. The Iraqi army is, in fact, exactly the kind of target  American military planners must have dreamed about for years: the Soviet army  without the Bomb (yet), without air cover, without a massive population and  industrial base to back it up.    If we are going to wage war, we need to keep our political and economic ends in  view. We must not destroy the oil industry that is our object to preserve, nor  alienate the moderate Arab states while destroying a radical one. We cannot  afford to provide Saddam Hussein with nightly news footage of little Arab girls  running down the road with their backs on fire -- especially not little Kuwaiti  girls.    On the other hand, the deaths of thousands of Iraqi men in uniform will prove  entirely acceptable to world opinion. If we beat Hussein's field army in the  desert, his garrison in Kuwait will wither on the vine.    Our greatest strategic advantage in this struggle is the moral high ground.  Let's keep it.

He forced it to land in Dusseldorf and demanded to be flown to New York, AP reports from Dusseldorf. It was not clear whether the man was armed. He was said to have demanded the US free a blind Islamic cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, linked to the bombing of New York's World Trade Centre. All passengers and four of the seven crew members were released as the KLM aircraft, which had been en route to Amsterdam from Tunis, Tunisia, sat on the tarmac at Rhein-Ruhr Airport. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-400, has a range of 3,800 km and would thus have to make an intermediate refuelling stop to reach New York. It would first, however, require refuelling in Dusseldorf. Shortly before 1300 GMT yesterday, the hijacker gave the aircraft's captain a note in English saying he would blow up the aircraft if it were not flown to New York, according to KLM in Amsterdam. The aircraft landed in Dusseldorf half an hour later. By 1530 GMT all but three of the crew members - the pilot, a co-pilot and a steward - had been freed, the airport official said. Authorities said no one had been hurt. The hijacker was demanding that the aircraft, which was surrounded by security forces and parked in front of a hangar, be refuelled.

He said at the annual lunch of the British Hospitality Association, which represents hoteliers, restaurateurs and caterers: 'When as hoteliers you order new tables for dining rooms, does anyone say: 'Would the knees of someone in a wheelchair fit under that table?' ' Lord Tebbit said his wife would not forgive him if he did not raise the issue. Lady Tebbit was disabled by the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory party conference in 1984. Lord Tebbit said proposals in the recent backbench bill on the rights of the disabled, which was defeated in May, were 'quite absurd' and would have imposed unjustifiable costs on organisations such as London Underground. But he told the association's members that support for the bill had been increased by a perception that the interests of the disabled had been ignored. He added that the tourist industry had to do more to protect the environment on which it depended for its success. One step the association could take would be to campaign for someone to take overall responsibility for the movement of London traffic.

They have been in custody for 15 days pending the  interrogations.    The defendants in this case face several charges, including  membership in a group established in violation of the law and  the Constitution that seeks to change the regime by force;  criminal agreement to carry out several bombing operations to  disturb security and damage the national economy; and possession  of explosives, bombs, and weapons without a license.    The defendants gave a detailed confession about the role of  each one of them in the recent bombings in front of a number of  banks in Cairo and al-Jizah. They also admitted that they  planned to assassinate some figures and police officers and blow  up a number of other banks.    The Prosecution Office has decided to seize the money found  with the defendants and to bring experts from the criminal  laboratory to examine the explosives and ammunition impounded.  Officials from the Prosecution Office examined six places where  the defendants used to hide and keep their weapons and  explosives. Eyewitnesses will later testify before the  prosecutors about the crimes of the defendants. Meanwhile, the  questioning of the defendants by prosecutors will continue.     "

The men, who were not immediately identified, were seized at  night last week from their homes in the Sidon region of south  Lebanon by members of the Lebanese army intelligence services,  they said.    The suspects were not presented with any arrest warrants,  were not given any reasons for being rounded up and were not  prosecuted, relatives said.    Reports of the alleged arrests coincided with strained ties  between Lebanon and Iraq, after Baghdad refused to lift the  immunity of two diplomats suspected of murdering a prominent  Iraqi dissident in Beirut last week.    The Lebanese cabinet held an emergency session on Monday to  discuss its relations with Iraq amid press speculation that  Beirut could sever diplomatic ties with Beirut.    Iraq has denied any involvement in the murder of Talib  Suhayl, a leader of the Free Iraqi Council opposition movement.    But Lebanese officials have said that Iraqi commercial  attache Khalid Khalaf and cultural attache Muhammad Kamil Kazim  had confessed their involvement in the killing. They have been  detained since last Wednesday.    Syria is Iraq's main Arab rival. Damascus deploys some  35,000 troops in Lebanon.     "

Three outstanding cases in the UK are scheduled to be heard in January. They involve charges of false accounting against Mr Nazmudin Virani, former chairman and chief executive of Control Securities, Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi, former managing director of Attock Oil, and Mr Imran Mohammed Ahmad Imam, an assistant to Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive. The SFO has issued three arrest warrants in connection with the cases. They cover Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a former BCCI depositor now believed to be in Morocco, Mr Mohammed Moizul Haque, a senior accounting officer at the bank, and Mr Basheer Chowdry, BCCI's UK general manager. Mr Haque and Mr Chowdry are both thought to be in Pakistan. The SFO investigation is continuing and officers say they expect more arrests in future. One active part of the inquiry is taking place in the Cayman Islands in co-operation with the Royal Cayman Island Police. Warrants have not been issued in the UK against Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's founder, who is now in Pakistan, but an SFO official said yesterday: 'If Abedi landed at Heathrow he would certainly be arrested.'

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which owns the building, said yesterday it would remove the now-defunct airline's name - currently displayed in 15-foot lights - and replace it with 'MetLife'. The insurer said that the letters would be replaced over the 'next few months'. 'Since Pan Am is no longer a tenant in the building and virtually out of business, it makes sense to replace the sign with a familiar name that symbolises strength, stability and long-term commitment to New York City', Mr Robert Schwartz, MetLife's chairman, said in a statement. Rumours that the insurance company, second largest in the US, was thinking of removing the Pan Am name have circulated for some time. Earlier this year, MetLife advertised for rental space in the building. Photographs accompanying the ads had the Pan Am name airbrushed out. That prompted some lobbying to persuade MetLife to keep the Pan Am letters - originally demanded at 30 feet by the airline's founder, Juan Trippe, when Pan Am moved into the building designed by Walter Gropius. But MetLife claimed yesterday that letters were running five to one in favour of the change, with families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing  -causing a Pan Am 747 to crash - anxious to see the old name disappear.

The warning was issued to the BBC in Cairo and in it the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, or Islamic groups, also claimed responsibility for the killing on Thursday of a police officer and his son in Upper Egypt. Diplomats in Cairo said they were 'looking into' the warning, but were treating it with circumspection. Groups claiming to be part of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya regularly send faxes to news organisations to claim or disclaim responsibility for violent incidents in Egypt. Similar warnings were issued by these groups before the spate of attacks on tourists, which began last summer. The Gama'a al-Islamiyya claims to be behind the attacks on tourists in Cairo and Upper Egypt which have already claimed the lives of at least three foreign visitors and an Egyptian. The most serious was the bombing last Friday of a crowded coffee-house in central Cairo in which a Swedish and a Turkish tourist were killed, along with one Egyptian. In yesterday's warning, the Gama'a Islamiyya said it 'calls all Arab and foreign countries' to advise their citizens to leave Egypt and 'preserve their lives'. It urged 'Egyptians, Arabs and foreigners' to 'call off' their investments in the country. 'Investments, but not the investors, could soon become a target to our just revenge,' it said.

In the interim, the city has persuaded a Pomona Superior Court judge to grant a  temporary restraining order requiring the owners and tenants who operate La  Villa Bar and JJ's Cocktail Lounge to take steps to prevent drug activity at  the establishments. The landlords and tenants were also ordered to clean up  inside the bars and the property outside.    Attorneys for the owners said that their clients had no knowledge about any  illegal activity but that they will work with the city to remedy any problems.  The operators of JJ's, Reynaldo and Victoria Virvia, could not be reached for  comment. Manuel Vargas, who runs La Villa with Jose L. Gonzalez, declined  comment.      Scores of Complaints    The bars, located in the 500-block of Azusa Avenue downtown, have prompted  scores of complaints from residents, city officials said.    ""Just about any and all types of criminal activity have taken place there,""  said police Lt. Jim Skogh .    The city's complaint alleged that last year police arrested 65 patrons at JJ's,  23 for either being under the influence of, having possession of or having  possession for sale of cocaine and heroin. The other 42 arrests involved  assaults, battery, possession of stolen property, public intoxication and  serving alcohol to minors.    At La Villa in 1988, police reported 20 arrests of patrons for being under the  influence of, having possession of or having possession for sale of cocaine and  heroin. During that time, police made 24 other arrests at the bar for incidents  involving gunfire, battery, illegal possession of weapons, possession of stolen  property, public intoxication and serving alcohol to minors.    Police Chief Lloyd J. Wood said that neither the owners nor operators have been  charged with a criminal offense in relation to any of the illegal activities in  the bar.    In seeking the closures, the city is using an innovative approach that relies  on part of the state Health and Safety Code. Under the code, municipalities can  ""permanently abate"" properties that present a public nuisance arising from  continued drug sales.    In its complaint, the city has requested that the taverns be closed for one  year, that the court be given control of the disposition of the property during  that time, that the bars' furnishings be auctioned and that the proceeds be  used to reimburse the city for legal and other costs. The city has also  requested a $25,000 fine be levied against each landlord.    On March 8 the city will ask Pomona Superior Court Judge Thomas F. Nuss to  prevent the taverns from selling alcohol until the case is tried, said City  Atty. Peter M. Thorson.      'Main Objective'    Thorson said the city ultimately wants no bars to be housed at either of the  properties, even if the landlords follow through on promises of evicting the  current tenants.    ""Our main objective is to prevent alcohol being served there and to end the  narcotics activities,"" Thorson said. ""If (the lessees) are out, we have no  objection to the premises being used for legitimate commercial or retail  activities.""    According to the city's complaint, the property where JJ's is located is owned  by physician James Joseph Femino, who has held title since 1982. A businessman,  Mark Chapin Johnson, has owned the La Villa property since October, 1987, the  complaint said. Neither could be reached for comment.    Attorney Robert L. Bacon, who represents Femino, said the lease with the bar's  operator expires on Tuesday and will not be renewed. David R. Nissen, who  represents Johnson, said the tenants have been notified that they must  immediately comply with the court's order or face eviction.    Both attorneys criticized the city for not informing them of the problems  before the complaint was filed.    ""This is an incredible case of what I feel is outrageous conduct by the city of  Azusa,"" said Bacon, a West Covina city councilman. ""How can they punish the  owners of the property when they've never given the owner . . . an opportunity  to correct the situation?""    Nissen said the lawful operation of the establishment is the tenant's  responsibility.      Expedient Method    ""Our client desires his property to be used in a lawful manner and not to be a  problem for the city,"" he said. ""He's taking all steps appropriate under the  law to see that all activity the city has alleged to have taken place there is  stopped immediately.    ""But . . . a simple phone call would have taken care of it without a lawsuit.""    Thorson said the city believed it was more expedient to go to court because the  majority of landlords would have been unresponsive to the city's requests.    ""Normally a phone call doesn't do it,"" he said. ""If a phone call would have  worked here, great. But 999 times out of 1,000 it wouldn't.""    As to the assertion that the tenants, not landlords, were responsible for the  conditions, Thorson said the law holds the property owner liable.    ""It's unfortunate that the innocent landowner suffers,"" he said. ""But they are  the people who are ultimately in control of the property, and they're the ones  the court says are responsible.""    Azusa officials said the civil approach has been used successfully in Los  Angeles and San Diego and that they learned of the procedure through  discussions with attorneys from those cities.    ""The cop on the beat can only do so much,"" Lt. Skogh said. ""Basic crime  fighting doesn't always work, so it's nice to have this civil remedy to fall  back on.""    ""Over the years it's been like putting your finger in a dam or stomping on a  brush fire,"" Skogh said.    The suit included affidavits from 25 police officers, four residents and six  owners of neighboring businesses who complained of illegal activities and the  effects of the bars on the community.    The complaint also notes that in November, a group of Azusa residents presented  the City Council with 170 signatures from residents complaining about the  ""deplorable"" situation at the bars, citing broken bottles, trash and drunks.    In the restraining order issued by Nuss on Feb. 16, the landlords and tenants  were ordered to report to police any illegal activity at the establishments,  something police say the operators have not done in the past.    In one incident, Skogh said, the police were notified by emergency-room staff  of a stabbing at one of the bars after the victim sought treatment. ""By the  time our officers got there, the blood had been cleaned up,"" he said.    Other provisions of Nuss' temporary restraining order include installing  outdoor lighting, hiring security guards, cleaning up the area around the bars,  refusing to serve patrons who appear to be drunk and adhering to state  Alcoholic Beverage Control Department regulations.    The order also states that signs be posted at the front and rear of the bars  indicating in English and Spanish that anyone in violation of the order could  face civil or criminal prosecution.    Skogh said the landlords have cooperated thus far with the city, but that not  all the provisions of the judge's order have been met.    As of late last week, the bars had yet to provide security guards or signs that  followed the exact wording and specifications outlined by the court, he said.    Chief Wood said he anticipates that similar actions may become necessary as the  city tries to combat narcotics problems at bars.    Wood, who in January was named president of the Los Angeles County Police  Chiefs Assn., predicted that other small cities would follow Azusa's lead,  because the procedure ""offers the only permanent solution to this kind of  problem.""

According to the city's complaint, the property where JJ's is located is owned  by physician James Joseph Femino, who has held title since 1982. A businessman,  Mark Chapin Johnson, has owned the La Villa property since October, 1987, the  complaint said. Neither could be reached for comment.    Attorney Robert L. Bacon, who represents Femino, said the lease with the bar's  operator expires on Tuesday and will not be renewed. David R. Nissen, who  represents Johnson, said the tenants have been notified that they must  immediately comply with the court's order or face eviction.    Both attorneys criticized the city for not informing them of the problems  before the complaint was filed.    ""This is an incredible case of what I feel is outrageous conduct by the city of  Azusa,"" said Bacon, a West Covina city councilman. ""How can they punish the  owners of the property when they've never given the owner . . . an opportunity  to correct the situation?""    Nissen said the lawful operation of the establishment is the tenant's  responsibility.      Expedient Method    ""Our client desires his property to be used in a lawful manner and not to be a  problem for the city,"" he said. ""He's taking all steps appropriate under the  law to see that all activity the city has alleged to have taken place there is  stopped immediately.    ""But . . . a simple phone call would have taken care of it without a lawsuit.""    Thorson said the city believed it was more expedient to go to court because the  majority of landlords would have been unresponsive to the city's requests.    ""Normally a phone call doesn't do it,"" he said. ""If a phone call would have  worked here, great. But 999 times out of 1,000 it wouldn't.""    As to the assertion that the tenants, not landlords, were responsible for the  conditions, Thorson said the law holds the property owner liable.    ""It's unfortunate that the innocent landowner suffers,"" he said. ""But they are  the people who are ultimately in control of the property, and they're the ones  the court says are responsible.""    Azusa officials said the civil approach has been used successfully in Los  Angeles and San Diego and that they learned of the procedure through  discussions with attorneys from those cities.    ""The cop on the beat can only do so much,"" Lt. Skogh said. ""Basic crime  fighting doesn't always work, so it's nice to have this civil remedy to fall  back on.""    ""Over the years it's been like putting your finger in a dam or stomping on a  brush fire,"" Skogh said.    The suit included affidavits from 25 police officers, four residents and six  owners of neighboring businesses who complained of illegal activities and the  effects of the bars on the community.    The complaint also notes that in November, a group of Azusa residents presented  the City Council with 170 signatures from residents complaining about the  ""deplorable"" situation at the bars, citing broken bottles, trash and drunks.    In the restraining order issued by Nuss on Feb. 16, the landlords and tenants  were ordered to report to police any illegal activity at the establishments,  something police say the operators have not done in the past.    In one incident, Skogh said, the police were notified by emergency-room staff  of a stabbing at one of the bars after the victim sought treatment. ""By the  time our officers got there, the blood had been cleaned up,"" he said.    Other provisions of Nuss' temporary restraining order include installing  outdoor lighting, hiring security guards, cleaning up the area around the bars,  refusing to serve patrons who appear to be drunk and adhering to state  Alcoholic Beverage Control Department regulations.    The order also states that signs be posted at the front and rear of the bars  indicating in English and Spanish that anyone in violation of the order could  face civil or criminal prosecution.    Skogh said the landlords have cooperated thus far with the city, but that not  all the provisions of the judge's order have been met.    As of late last week, the bars had yet to provide security guards or signs that  followed the exact wording and specifications outlined by the court, he said.    Chief Wood said he anticipates that similar actions may become necessary as the  city tries to combat narcotics problems at bars.    Wood, who in January was named president of the Los Angeles County Police  Chiefs Assn., predicted that other small cities would follow Azusa's lead,  because the procedure ""offers the only permanent solution to this kind of  problem.""

That is the recurring theme of the reports from  Bosnia-Herzegovina carried by the majority of the media.    Clearly NATO was secretly hoping for decisive intervention  by  Russia, knowing that it would be practically impossible to end  the crisis situation around Sarajevo and the whole Balkan  conflict without its more active participation. However,  projects in diplomats' heads are one thing, real specific moves  for which statesmen have to assume responsibility toward their  own people and history are quite another.    NATO placed not just itself but the whole world in an  extreme  situation. Europe could have been faced with an unpredictable  escalation of the Bosnian war. NATO could only be saved from  itself by Russia, and Russia made that tough decision. By  persuading the Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms or place them  under UN control Moscow simultaneously contrasted its own  reputation as a great world power to NATO's. A reconnaissance  group from the staff of the Russian Blue Beret battalion  stationed in Serbian Krajina plus a group from the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry headed by Colonel General Yevgeniy  Podkolzin, commander of the airborne assault troops, were  dispatched to the area of anticipated bombing. Their aim was to  guarantee the Serbian side's fulfillment of its commitments to  withdraw arms and to study all questions of a political and  organizational nature connected with the Russian contingent's  deployment, including its possible reinforcement. It should be  specially stressed that this decision does to a certain extent  run counter to Moscow's earlier ban on Russian assault troops'  carrying out the order of the UN Forces Command in former  Yugoslavia redeploying part of the force to Sarajevo. That ban  was more than justified. Moscow could not let its soldiers pay  with their lives for a NATO bombing decision which it had  nothing to do with. Here the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry made efforts to prevent NATO air strikes against  targets belonging to any side, including the Bosnian Muslims,  both through diplomatic channels and via its own line of  communications.    In a personal telephone conversation with U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry -- there had been three conversations in  all as of Monday -- Army General Pavel Grachev, the Russian  president's authorized representative, drew his American  counterpart's attention to the fact that the Bosnian Serbs were  systematically withdrawing their heavy artillery weapons 20-30  km from Sarajevo or placing them under UN control. The  withdrawal was being carried out in unfavorable weather  conditions -- abundant snow and drifts on the roads -- which  made it considerably more difficult for the Russian contingent  to move forward and take up position. Not all the provisions of  the ultimatum will perhaps have been met on schedule, but the  Serbian side's firm intention to carry it out in full renders  strikes redundant. Moreover, the Americans' attention was drawn  to the fact that Russian soldiers in a number of spots find  themselves on routes along which it was intended to carry out  missile and bomb strikes. The U.S. defense secretary was  informed of the Russian leadership's view, namely that the  Bosnian Serbs' positive decision to withdraw their forces not  only removed the question of using aircraft against the sides in  conflict but also created real prerequistes for a political  settlement of the conflict. In the Russian side's opinion, the  positive procress now under way needs joint support.    As we were informed at the Russian Defense Ministry  Information Administration, another telephone conversation will  take place between Pavel Grachev and William Perry Monday  evening, during which measures to relieve the tension  surrounding the Bosnian capital will continue to be examined.  Statements made by certain hotheads in NATO suggesting that it  was premature to abandon air strikes and calls from them to  ""hold negotiations while simultaneously carrying out strikes""  causes Russia special alarm.    Telephone contacts have also been maintained at the highest  level. On Sunday, on the initiative of Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, a telephone conversation took place between him and  President Bill Clinton. As a result of that conversation a  final accord was reached on averting bombing in the light of the  efforts made by Russian diplomats and military men. The U.S.  President spoke highly of Boris Yeltsin's political initiative,  which had made it possible to reduce the acuteness of the crisis  substantially. It was confirmed during their conversation that  all decisions arising from the development of the situation  around Sarajevo will be made with UN mediation, as called for by  the Russian side.

Instructions have gone out to all schools to observe a minute's silence today for Mr Giovanni Falcone, the leading anti-Mafia magistrate who was killed with his wife and their bodyguards on May 23 last year. The commemoration also covers Mr Paolo Borsellino, Mr Falcone's colleague, killed with his escort two months later. In Palermo where both killings occurred, as well as throughout all big Italian cities, ceremonies and demonstrations are planned over the weekend to commemorate these two brutal killings. Magistrates investigating the Falcone murder revealed this week that his secret movements were almost certainly betrayed to the Mafia from inside Italy's security services. Since last December, Mr Bruno Contrada, head of Mafia intelligence in Sisde, the domestic intelligence service, has been in custody on allegations of consorting with the Mafia. Recent tests on cigarette butts - left by those who planted the huge explosive device which killed Mr Falcone as he drove into Palermo from the airport - show three people were involved. But no arrests have been made of those who carried out the bombing. In the case of the Borsellino killing, police have arrested a man for alleged involvement in placing the fatal car bomb. This week also saw the capture of Nitto Santapoala, the number two in the Sicilian Mafia who is believed to have been behind the killings.   Countries:-  ITZ  Italy, EC.

The six Super Galeb aircraft were in the air a short period  when they were spotted by an AWACS radar plane which relayed  their location to two US F-16 fighter jets, the source said. He  added that the order to shoot down the planes was given by the  NATO headquarters in Italy after the Bosnian Serb planes ignored  orders to land.    Earlier, the [French] Defense Ministry here said the Galeb  aircraft were in the process of bombing a Moslem-operated  weapons factory near the central town of Vitez when four of them  were shot down.    Speaking in Mostar in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, UN  special  representative for the former Yugoslavia Yasuchi Akashi said he  ""understood that (the) two other planes landed in Banja Luka  airport.""    Akashi added that he had contacted Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic and the two had agreed ""on the importance of  not overdramatising this particular incident.""    The Bosnian Serbs have often been accused of using the Banja  Luka airport for helicopter flights which were in violation of a  UN no-flight ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Although the flights were detected by AWACS radar planes,  NATO jets could not intervene as the helicopters were flying low  and in moutainous regions.     "

The IRA had been told that if it ended terrorism, the  British  and Irish governments would be ""generous in their response,"" he  added.

First the press  provided information on the upcoming joint exercise by the U.S.  3d Infantry Division and the Russian 27th Motorized Rifle  Division for the purpose of rehearsing cooperation in  peacemaking actions. A little later we learned of the bombing  strikes by U.S. peacemakers in the south of Bosnia. The  southern Urals and southern Bosnia are separated by many  thousands of kilometers, but the upcoming event and the past one  are tied up in a tight and intricate logical knot.    Our own correspondent Ivan Gavrilenko reports that the news  of the military maneuvers on the Totskiy range elicited a  sharply negative reaction from the peasants of Orenburg Oblast,  which was singed by the flash from the first atomic explosion  conducted in the Soviet Union.    Until recently the Totskiy range, where the exercise is  planned, was top-secret. This region also has other military  installations which are of undoubted interest to foreign  specialists, and it has to be thought that the Pentagon will  certainly not be sending new recruits to Russia.    We have managed to ascertain from the Ground Forces Main  Staff that the measure is being conducted in accordance with the  plan of contacts between the armed forces of Russia and the  United States. No more than 250 servicemen will be involved on  each side. The Americans will land up to 50 units of wheeled  equipment at the Totskiy Training Center, where they have  already been to reconnoiter. Joint actions will be rehearsed as  part of a peacemaking force from 6 through 14 July.    A detail of some importance: In the opinion of the military,  this measure will not require of us any unplanned expenditure,  since one of the 27th Division's regiments is due to hold a  planned exercise at precisely that time. But the Americans will  have to fork out $2 million. They will pay our military to  operate engineer equipment and for fuel, lubricants, water,  food, and all the services provided. So there is even an  opportunity to earn a little currency.    In general, the Russian military leaders have, at first  sight, undertaken a good and profitable thing. It is  undoubtedly necessary to strengthen and develop contacts between  the two countries' armies. But how are we to avoid the  importunate questions of fellow citizens? Why do the Americans  need to send over their aircraft together with servicemen and  hardware from the German city of Wuerzburg, where the 3d  Infantry Division is stationed, right over to the Urals, deep  inside Russia? Would it not be simpler to hold exercises of a  very simple nature at Khodynskoye Pole, for example, or  somewhere in Moscow Oblast?    Interest is also aroused by the NATO division's highly  original service record. It performed ""peacemaking"" combat  operations in Korea and Iraq. Where will future itineraries  take it? To the former Yugoslavia, maybe. General M. Rose,  commander of the UN troops, needs just such decisive combined  units. The whole world shuddered at the blasts of the bombs  dropped by NATO aircraft in southern Bosnia, but the general is  insisting on new strikes. The U.S. President has pronounced a  sentence which sounded roughly as follows: We work closely with  Gen. Rose, and I believe that his aggressiveness is a good thing.    Here are peacemakers for you!    Our newspaper has already written about the political  aspects  of the recent NATO action. Let us touch on the military  aspects. We are seeing for the umpteenth time that NATO has  very mediocre airmen in its ranks. Obviously embarrassed, a  White House official spokesperson recently declared on  television that one of the U.S. pilots tried to drop four bombs  on the Serbs, but succeeded in releasing just three, and two of  them did not explode. It also is not entirely clear what was  destroyed as a result of the bombing strikes -- a tank or a  medical vehicle. It is perfectly clear that peaceful people  died as a result of those raids.    It is worth recalling that U.S. pilots were also  distinguished by similar results in Iraq three years ago: They  aimed at military targets but hit peaceful houses and even their  own positions. Incidentally, they have also distinguished  themselves during these days: They downed two of their own  helicopters with accurate rocket fire and dispatched 26 officers  to the next world.    The punitive actions undertaken by the United Nations  without  coordination with Russia have sharply exacerbated the situation  and galvanized combat operations by the opposing sides. But  maybe the politicians will realize that neither bombs nor  missiles can bring the Serbs to their knees. Only a peaceful  way out of the crisis will be productive.     "

Radojcic, age 42, from  Zagreb, who was once an official of the Central Committee of the  League of Communists of Croatia, continues the Labrador affair,  which has dragged on for two-and-a-half years now, and whose  exposure, along with the Opera case, is the greatest success of  the Croatian MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] in the  intelligence war being waged continuously with the Serbian  secret services. But those two affairs were at the same time, at  least until Radojcic's apprehension, only the tip of the  iceberg, since networks of Serbian informers were largely  undetected. All of this is clearly supported by the history of  Labrador itself.    At the height of the fiercest aggression of the former JNA  [Yugoslav People's Army] in the fall of 1991, it became obvious  that essential information was ""leaking"" from responsible  positions in the Croatian Government and that there was for  certain a group that was conducting in an organized way or  preparing terrorist actions in order to compromise Croatian  policy and its top people. One of the most serious confirmations  of the existence of such groups were the actions of bombing  Mirogoj, where the graves of Jews are located, and the placing  of explosives on the building of the Jewish congregation in  Zagreb, which was aimed at portraying the Croatian Government to  the world public as neo-Nazi. Suspicions proved to be correct,  since over the period from 15 to 17 October 1991 the MUP  initiated an investigation against 12 persons for what was then  alleged to be ""association for the purpose of hostile activity,  terrorism, commando operations, and sabotage, and in order to  cause public panic and insecurity.""    Five at Large    Five of those 12 were at large (among them Radojcic), while  seven were arrested (Srecko Ozegovic, Branko Trazivuk, Mile  Vasiljevski...), among them both Croats and Serbs, some of them  cadres ""inherited"" from the former regime, while others came to  their positions after the change of government. The group, which  came to be called Labrador from its own plan of operations,  consisted of three ""security"" officers, four officials in the  MUP department for protection of the constitutional order, one  authorized official of the MUP, two from the technical services  of the Croatian parliament, a former policeman from the Zagreb  Police Department, and another person not employed. The group  was led and inspired from Belgrade, which was also the origin of  the equipment in the form of the time bombs.    It was only a short time after the processing of the  arrestees that the Croatian police brought in another 50 persons  suspected of the same crimes. Milan Brezak, assistant minister  of internal affairs, himself declared in early November that  some of these people were sitting in offices next to his, and  they were planning to blow up important facilities, to  assassinate leading figures.... The investigation has made  progress, revealing an incredibly intertwined KOS  [counterintelligence service] network, which was later confirmed  in a newspaper interview by Ante Nobilo, former deputy district  public prosecutor in Zagreb, who said that the investigation had  penetrated an increasing number of political circles, revealing  new members of KOS.    The Belgrade Trial    However, before the investigation was concluded and the  suspects thoroughly questioned, the arrestees were released,  that is, exchanged, on the basis of a political assessment.  Thus, further investigatory proceedings were stopped before all  the KOS connections and all the informers were discovered.    This assessment was later confirmed by Lt. Col. Ivan  Sabolovic, who was tried in Belgrade for the bombing of Jewish  facilities in Zagreb. Sabolovic said that only a part of the  network was blown, since their essential structures remained  untouched. Just like Sabolovic, certain other essential  organizers of the KOS networks in Croatia also remained out of  the reach of Croatian authorities, and this especially applies  to Col. Slobodan Rakocevic, former security chief in the ""JNA  Air Force,"" who incidentally had the closest connections with  the Opera group (propaganda operations), another espionage  organization with the same tasks against Croatia. Nor was Slavko  Malobabic, who with five other persons was one of the principal  organizers of Labrador, accessible to Croatian authorities.  Since Malobabic was known in Zagreb as a ""man with good  connections and friends"" (at one time he held the position of  chief of staff of Stanko Stojcevic, chief of the Croatian  communists, and then the post of spokesman of the Secretariat  for Internal Affairs), one of the tasks that he and Radojcic had  was to bring new members into the group and expand the network.  It is still a secret how successful they were in that, and how  far they went in this espionage effort. Until Radojcic's recent  apprehension, when, we hope, the links of this dangerous chain  were completely revealed.     "

It was not known whether there were casualties or how many people had been arrested. Westerners were confined to their hotels and police were patrolling the streets in strength last night. A protest by about 800 people, apparently against price rises, began peacefully during the morning outside a main government building. The demonstrators initially met no response from police, but were eventually moved on. During the evening, the crowd swelled to between 1,000 and 4,000 and attacked shops, almost certainly those run by Chinese, said Mr Robbie Barnett, director of the London-based Tibet Information Network. An influx of Chinese traders into Lhasa has aroused enmity among Tibetans. Reuters news agency, quoting travellers in Lhasa, said protesters were throwing rocks at the police headquarters and chanted slogans calling for Tibetan independence. Public demonstrations of Tibetan hostility to Chinese rule are rare because of tight control by the authorities. The protests came the day after the 42nd anniversary of the surrender document being signed following China's 1951 invasion. A dozen senior European diplomats are due to produce a report on human rights in Tibet after a week-long visit which ended on Sunday. They had abandoned plans to hold a dinner for their hosts because of continuing arrests of Tibetan dissidents.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.

By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The House gave overwhelming approval Friday to a comprehensive election-year  anti-crime bill after approving more than 30 amendments to shape it along lines  generally favored by the Bush Administration and many law enforcement leaders.    The legislation, which must be reconciled with a crime bill passed earlier by  the Senate before going to the President for his signature, adds 20 more  federal crimes to those punishable by death, shortens the appellate process for  state Death Row inmates, allows the continued domestic manufacture of  rapid-fire assault weapons and loosens the so-called exclusionary rule banning  the courtroom use of improperly seized evidence.    After amendments were debated nearly 13 hours over a two-day period, the final  bill was approved by a vote of 368 to 55, with most of the ""no"" votes cast by  liberal Democrats and members of the Congressional Black Caucus.    The bill was viewed by opponents as a stern law-and-order package permitting  House members to convince voters that they are tough on crime. The House did,  however, reject an effort to remove a key ""racial justice"" provision affecting  the rights of potential Death Row inmates.    This provision allows black defendants convicted of capital crimes to introduce  statistical evidence before their sentencing to demonstrate that a racial  imbalance has occurred among Death Row inmates in their states. The judge must  consider this in determining a sentence.    Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, in a statement after passage of the bill, said that  ""this misguided provision"" must be deleted by House and Senate conferees or the  President would veto the legislation.    Thornburgh said that this section would damage enforcement of the death penalty  because it ""would mandate consideration of statistics concerning racial  characteristics of both defendants and victims"" and impose unwanted ""racial  quotas on our death penalty laws.""    Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose) told the House that criminal justice statistics  show that black defendants have a three-to-four-times greater chance of being  executed than whites. The racial provision ""is designed to ensure fairness in  implementing the death penalty,"" said Edwards, who is chairman of the House  Judiciary subcommittee on constitutional rights.    As the price for heading off a move by Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.)  to delete the provision altogether, Rep. William J. Hughes (D-N. J.), a key  sponsor of the measure, successfully won House approval to water it down in  hopes of meeting the Administration's objections.    The changes voted would reduce the legal importance of racial statistics in  determining a defendant's sentence. The original provision would have required  a judge to consider the statistics as proof of past bias. The new provision  would reduce the weight of such statistics to simply an ""inference of bias.""  The revised wording would lessen the burden of proof for state prosecutors in  rebutting the statistics.    Rep. Jim Slattery (D-Kan.), who argued for the provision, said the General  Accounting Office had discovered that, of more than 125 executions carried out  in state prisons since capital punishment was resumed in 1977, ""no white man  has been convicted and executed for killing a black man or any member of a  minority.""    ""Think about that. It's incredible,"" Slattery told his colleagues.    Aside from the racial provision, Thornburgh said that House passage of the  anti-crime legislation ""represents a significant step toward assisting the  nation's police and prosecutors in guaranteeing the first civil right of all  Americans -- the right to be safe in our homes, on our streets and in our  communities.""    The House acted to expand the list of federal capital crimes to include such  offenses as a mail bombing in which someone dies, the assassination of a  President or one of many government officials, a terrorist bombing in which  someone dies on an airplane or other forms of transportation, treason,  espionage or the causing of a death in connection with a drug crime.    The House eased the exclusionary rule to permit the introduction of evidence  seized without a warrant if a police officer obtained it in ""good faith.""    ""Let's put the rights of law-abiding citizens ahead of a criminal's right,""  said Rep. Denny Smith (R-Ore.) in arguing for the change.    Another House-passed provision would amend the federal bankruptcy code to  prohibit persons convicted of savings and loan fraud from spending ill-gotten  gains on their personal homes. In such cases, it would remove the homestead  exemption, a legal shelter that usually keeps a bankrupt businessman from  losing his home.    ""I'm getting tired of S&L crooks who live in palatial mansions draining  money from their innocent victims,"" said Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie (R-Ohio),  author of the provision.

0,FT942-7652 ,"FT942-7652 _AN-EEZDOAIBFT 940524   FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Poland acts on copyright abuse      By REUTER      WARSAW   Poland cracked down on copyright abuse yesterday by implementing a law intended to end video and music piracy and strengthen intellectual property rights, Reuter reports from Warsaw. The law, passed by parliament in February and taking effect after a three-month grace period, is intended to end piracy which costs the state treasury millions of dollars a year, and bring Polish laws in line with international norms. Polish artists welcomed the new law but said its efficacy would largely depend on how well it was enforced. The new legislation replaces a weak and outdated 1952 copyright law under which the police's ability to make arrests was limited. A part of the law governing computer piracy went into effect immediately after it was passed in February. The weakness of the old law helped music, video and computer piracy flourish after communist rule ended in 1989, flooding the streets with hawkers of cheap cassettes. It was also a discouragement for some foreign investors. The IFPI estimated that the state treasury lost a minimum of Dollars 25m in 1991 and probably much more in 1992 to music pirates alone and official producers lost three times as much. Computer software is dominated by pirated programmes. Those losses should be quickly reduced, experts say, and prices of official recordings are not expected to rise much as a result of the new law.   Countries:-  PLZ  Poland, East Europe.

THE PRESIDENT  OFFERS A $250,000 REWARD.      By MARJORIE MILLER and TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      SAN SALVADOR      President Alfredo Cristiani said Saturday that the official investigation into  last month's assassinations of six Jesuit priests is focusing on the Salvadoran  armed forces, but he refused to blame the murders on the military.    Cristiani said FBI and Salvadoran investigators have the names of all soldiers  posted in the area of Central American University on Nov. 16, the night the  priests, their cook and her daughter were shot to death at the Jesuit residence  there. Sources close to the investigation said interrogations of the nearly 200  soldiers and their commanding officers have begun, and some of the men will be  required to take lie-detector tests.    Cristiani also said that he is willing to resume peace talks with the  guerrillas battling his government if the rebels stop fighting in civilian  areas by Friday.    He said that representatives of the two sides could meet in Caracas, Venezuela,  beginning Dec. 20 to arrange a cease-fire and negotiate a peace by Feb. 15.  After that, he said, the rebels would be expected to join the political  process.    The president, who is under intense pressure from the United States to solve  the killings of the priests, offered a $250,000 reward, immunity from  prosecution and protection to witnesses who ""indirectly participated"" in the  murders.    At the same time, however, Cristiani asserted that the only witness to come  forward so far in the case -- a cleaning woman who was spirited to Miami under  heavy guard after testifying before a Salvadoran judge -- has recanted her  statement under FBI questioning.    Roman Catholic Church officials have privately protested the U.S.  interrogations of Lucia Barrera de Cerna, who earlier had testified she saw  uniformed gunmen enter the university the night of the murders. Since arriving  in Miami, Barrera de Cerna reportedly changed her story twice as she was  submitted to six polygraph tests over a three-day period, according to sources  involved in the investigation. She failed all six tests, the sources said.    Church officials suggested that the woman might have been coerced or  intimidated.    But William Walker, U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, denied that the woman had  been pressured and said he was disappointed that her testimony may not be  usable.    ""Why would anyone think . . . we would go to all that trouble (of relocating  her and her family to Miami) just to discredit her?"" he said. ""Our efforts are  to get to the truth.. . . I think (the investigation) is moving just as fast as  (the government's) operational capacity allows.""    American officials have said that both the survival of Cristiani's  administration and the continuance of U.S. aid to El Salvador -- more than $1  million a day -- could be in danger if the Jesuit case is not solved.    The priests, including university rector Ignacio Ellacuria, were killed during  an overnight curfew in an area that had been militarized because of a fierce  guerrilla offensive launched in the capital Nov. 11.    Two army units were stationed less than a mile from the campus that night, and  Treasury Police were posted at a vacant office building about 500 yards from  the site of the murders, sources close to the investigation said. Security  forces had searched the university residence three days earlier.    ""We obviously now are gearing the major strength of the investigation within .  . . the armed forces,"" Cristiani said.    Members of Cristiani's Cabinet and the armed forces have publicly blamed the  killings on leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels.  Cristiani said he would wait for investigators to determine the culprits but  added that he could not rule out the armed forces, the extreme right or the  left.    Cristiani spoke at a press conference shortly before boarding a flight to San  Jose, Costa Rica, for a Central American summit scheduled to start today. He  will join the presidents of Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua for a  two-day meeting aimed at salvaging a regional peace plan.    The two-year-old plan was dealt a near-fatal blow last month when El Salvador  suspended diplomatic relations with Nicaragua for allegedly supplying weapons  to the Salvadoran rebels. The Salvadoran government had discovered a shipment  of anti-aircraft missiles aboard a Nicaraguan government plane apparently  destined for the guerrillas.    Cristiani, remarking on another unsolved case of political violence, blamed the  Oct. 31 bombing of a crowded union hall, which left 10 people dead, on FMLN  rebels. He said a captured guerrilla had told authorities the bombing was  designed to ""create martyrs"" for the leftist insurgency.

A detainer is the mechanism by which the Service requests that the detaining agency notify the Service of the date, time, or place of release of an alien who has been arrested or convicted under federal, state, or local law. The Service agrees with the commenter that the standards for issuance of a detainer are no greater than those for issuance of an order to show cause and a warrant of arrest for immigration violations. The final rule deletes the requirement of successful completion of basic immigration law enforcement training for authorization to issue detainers. Training in immigration law and procedure is necessary to issue detainers, but training as a law enforcement officer is not needed to effectively conduct this portion of the immigration process. This does not eliminate the immigration officer's responsibility to ensure that detainers are issued only to aliens who are amenable to exclusion or deportation proceedings.  Two commenters stated that the authority to issue a warrant of arrest in 242.2(c) should include the authority to serve the warrant of arrest in 287.5(e)(2). The Service disagrees. Issuance of a warrant of arrest entails signature by an authorized immigration officer, while service of the warrant entails a step-by-step process requiring training and proficiency in service of process procedures. The two authorities are separate and distinct processes.      Section 287.1_Definitions      One commenter urged the inclusion of the Other Than Permanent Full-Time (OTP) Immigration Inspector Basic Training Course in the definition of ``basic immigration law enforcement training'' in 287.1(g). The Service agrees and this section has been amended accordingly. However, an OTP immigration inspector will not be authorized to make arrests for federal offenses under section 287(a)(5) (A) and (B) of the Act until such time as he or she converts status to permanent full-time and successfully completes training applicable to that position.  Four commenters urged the Service to expand the definition of ``basic immigration law enforcement training'' in 287.1(g) to include prior law enforcement experience or training with other federal, state, or local agencies as well as lengthy Service experience or other miscellaneous Service training courses apart from the basic training courses. The Service acknowledges that successful completion of one or more training courses presented by the Federal Government or a state-certified program may be substantially equivalent to basic immigration law enforcement training. The final rule provides a mechanism for considering other training by expanding the definition of ``basic immigration law enforcement training'' to include training that is substantially equivalent thereto as determined by the Commissioner with the approval of the Deputy Attorney General. The Commissioner's review is necessary to ensure that each immigration officer has all the required federal and, in particular, immigration law enforcement training. For example, an immigration officer who was employed previously in another Federal agency as a special agent, and thus had training in general Federal laws, would still need immigration law enforcement training.      Sections 287.5 and 287.9_Exercise of Power by Immigration Officers and Criminal Search Warrant and Firearms Policies      Ninety-eight commenters expressed concern that the proposed regulations precluded immigration officers from carrying firearms in 287.5(f) and 287.9(b), effecting arrests for immigration violations in 287.5(c) (1), (2), and (5), and serving process in 287.5(e) while off duty. The commenters stated that it is not uncommon for immigration officers or other federal law enforcement officers in an off-duty status to receive telephone calls at home from other federal, state, or local law enforcement officers requesting their immediate assistance. The commenters pointed out that only 287(a)(5) (A) and (B) of the Act, regarding arrest authority for federal offenses, stipulate that an immigration officer must be ``performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest'' and that this language should not be included in those sections of the proposed rule regarding the other enforcement authorities. In drafting the proposed rule, the Service did not intend to impair an immigration officer's ability to place himself or herself on duty when necessary for the purpose of enforcing the immigration laws of the United States. To avoid misinterpretation, the Service has removed the language ``performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest'' from the enforcement authorities except where required by statute. The Service has also removed the language ``In an on duty status'' from 287.9(b). Administrative guidelines will be developed to explain when an immigration officer on his or her own initiative may place himself or herself in an on-duty status.       "

The long-awaited congressional session, announced this week, comes at a time  when violence along the border is said to be on the rise, as is the number of  illegal border crossings.    Human rights activists along the border have long lobbied for some form of  congressional airing of alleged abuses by officers of the U.S. Border Patrol, a  uniformed arm of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and by other law  enforcement personnel.    Immigration officials and other law enforcement agencies operating along the  border have generally stated that the abuse has been exaggerated or that  officers have acted in self-defense when they have shot or otherwise injured  would-be immigrants during confrontations.    The issue of border violence, although attracting less national attention than  that of illegal immigration, has been exceptionally divisive in the bicultural  communities along the almost-2,000-mile long border. It has often pitted Latino  and immigrant rights groups against mostly white law enforcement agencies.    After considerable delay, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's subcommittee on  human rights and international organizations has agreed to tackle the issue.    ""What we're hoping is that, by taking our message to Washington, we will not  only get the attention of the INS, but also send out a message that we're dead  serious about putting an end to human rights violations along the border,"" said  Roberto Martinez, a long-time human rights activist in San Diego who works with  the border program of the American Friends Service Committee, social action arm  of the Quaker Church.    ""We can't go for another decade with this kind of dismal record of human rights  abuses along the border,"" said Martinez, who is scheduled to speak at the  congressional hearings.    He expressed the hope that the session will lead to a reform of training  procedures that will lessen the possibility of abuse by immigration officers.  Another possibility, Martinez said, is that some form of improved internal  investigation of abuse allegations could emerge. Activists have long alleged  that officials whitewash investigations of abuse -- an allegation denied by  U.S. and local law enforcement authorities.    Virginia Kice, an INS spokesman in Los Angeles, declined to comment on the  upcoming hearings, but said that INS officials are also concerned about  violence along the border. INS officials have condemned attacks against the  almost 4,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents who are posted along the Southwestern  border, which stretches from the Gulf of Mexico in Texas to the Pacific Ocean  in California.    Among the lawmakers calling for the hearings was Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-Pico  Rivera), who issued a strong statement condemning incidents of abuse.    ""Reports of violence and human rights violations at the hands of Border Patrol  agents, local law enforcement officials and self-styled vigilantes are on the  increase,"" Torres said. ""Shootings, beatings and harassment are unconscionable  practices that should not be associated with U.S. government officials.""    U.S. Rep Jim Bates (D-San Diego) was also among the congressmen calling for the  hearing on border abuse. ""I'm very pleased that the treatment of Mexicans by  U.S. officials and citizens will be fully aired this soon,"" Bates said. Bates  said he discussed the issue during a recent meeting with Mexican President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari in Mexico City.    Among the most infamous incidents in the San Diego area -- the nation's busiest  legal and illegal border crossing -- was the shooting by a Border Patrol agent,  in April 1985, of Humberto Carrillo Estrada, a 12-year-old Mexican boy who was  hit as he stood in Mexican territory in Tijuana.    U.S. authorities cleared the agent of any wrongdoing, contending he shot the  youngster as he was being attacked by a group of rock-throwing migrants. But a  U.S. District judge later awarded $570,000 in damages to Carrillo, who suffered  permanent injuries in the shooting.    There are no firm figures indicating that incidents of violence are increasing  along the border.    Recently, there have been reports that youthful vigilantes have been patrolling  the border in San Diego, although others have disputed the extent of the  youths' activities. There have been a number of documented attacks against  migrants by U.S. citizens, including the hate-crime murders of two Mexican  migrant laborers in northern San Diego County in November 1988.    The hearings come at a time when U.S. officials say more and more people appear  to be entering the United States illegally via the southwestern border, a  situation that always results in heightened tension. In the past 10 months,  U.S. immigration officials say, arrests border-wide -- a barometer of illegal  immigration -- have increased by almost one-third when over the same period  during 1988-89. In the past six months, arrests in the San Diego area have  risen by more than half.

The bombs were hurled by hooded individuals and one of them  exploded near the headquarters of the Dominican Revolutionary  Party (PRD) headed by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential  candidate in the 16 May elections who has made accusations of  fraud. A police report said that there were no casualties but  there were several arrests of individuals presumably responsible  for the attacks. The police and Army initiated a surveillance  operation along the streets to prevent another attack.    The political crisis erupted when the elections closed with  the PRD making accusations of a ""scandalous fraud"" planned by  the followers of President Joaquin Balaguer at the Central  Electoral Board (JCE) computer center.    Tourism representatives reported that numerous trips,  especially from Europe, were suspended because of the news  generated by the crisis facing the country. ""The Dominican  Republic political situation is a threat to the tourism industry  which generates substantial revenues for the country,"" an  important tourism businessman pointed out. The Dominican  Republic is visited by 1.4 million tourists who generate more  than $130 million, the equivalent of 70 percent of its  exportable goods.     "

PALTROW, Times Staff Writer      NEW YORK      A criminal insider trading investigation that shook Wall Street in 1987 with  the highly publicized arrests of three senior traders ended Thursday with the  announcement that one of the men will plead guilty to a single felony count.    No charges will be filed against the other two. The U.S. Attorney's Office in  Manhattan said that Robert M. Freeman, the former head of arbitrage at the  investment firm Goldman, Sachs & Co., will plead guilty to a mail fraud  count stemming from one incident of insider trading.    But Acting U.S. Atty. Benito Romano said his office, after more than two years  of investigation, had decided it won't file any charges against Richard B.  Wigton, the former head of risk arbitrage and over-the-counter trading at  Kidder, Peabody & Co., and Timothy L. Tabor, a former Kidder official who  later worked at Merrill Lynch. The decision lays to rest the government's  longstanding contention that there was a broad criminal conspiracy among the  three to trade inside information on pending takeover deals.    Romano admitted Thursday that the government had made a mistake by arresting  the three in February, 1987, although he said he doesn't believe that  prosecutors owe Wigton and Tabor an apology for the lengthy investigation.    ""We would have been better advised not to have proceeded with an arrest at such  an early stage of the investigation,"" Romano said. The arrests, in which the  men were handcuffed and two were physically removed from their offices by  federal agents, were extremely unusual in securities fraud cases. The arrests  had been ordered by then-U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani, now a candidate for  mayor of New York.    After the arrests, Tabor lost his job at Merrill Lynch and Wigton was forced to  take a leave of absence from Kidder. A Kidder spokeswoman said Thursday that  the firm is holding talks with Wigton, who is 59, about returning to work.    The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to file civil insider  trading charges against Freeman. Sources on Thursday said that despite  prosecutors' decision not to bring criminal charges against Tabor and Wigton,  the SEC may still bring civil charges against them and against Goldman Sachs.  An SEC official declined to comment Thursday. Lawrence Pedowitz, a lawyer for  Goldman Sachs, said he had ""absolutely no idea"" if the SEC will bring charges  against the firm.    Lawyers for Freeman, 47, confirmed that he will plead guilty to a single felony  count relating to the use of inside information in trading Beatrice Cos.  options in 1986. He also resigned from Goldman Sachs on Thursday.    In his plea agreement, Freeman did not agree to cooperate with prosecutors in  any continuing investigations. He appeared briefly Thursday in U.S. District  Court in Manhattan to waive his right to a grand jury indictment. He is  expected to formally plead guilty on Sept. 5.      Deal Hit a Snag    In a document filed with the court, Freeman admitted that he had received  inside information on a single occasion from Martin Siegel, the former Kidder  investment banker who represented Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in its  leveraged buyout of Beatrice. Siegel later pleaded guilty to securities fraud  and tax evasion charges and gave prosecutors information that led to the  investigation of Freeman, Tabor and Wigton.    In the court document, Freeman said that in early January, even before his  conversation with Siegel, he had begun selling his personal stake in Beatrice  and reducing Goldman Sach's position because of suspicion that something had  gone wrong with the Beatrice deal. But Freeman then talked by phone with  Bernard Lasker, a broker whose nickname is ""Bunny."" Lasker passed along a rumor  that the Beatrice transaction had in fact hit a snag.    Freeman said he received illegal inside information from Siegel in the form of  a brief remark confirming the accuracy of the rumor. Freeman said Siegel told  him ""Your bunny has a good nose."" Based on that remark, Freeman ordered the  sale of additional Beatrice options.    The snag turned out to be a change in the structure of the deal, in which  holders of Beatrice stock would be given less cash than originally envisioned.  When the restructuring was disclosed publicly, the price of Beatrice stock fell  by more than $4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    The guilty plea marked an abrupt reversal by Freeman. For more than two years,  he strongly maintained that he was innocent of any wrongdoing. In public  statements, Goldman Sachs also had vigorously defended Freeman and kept him on  its staff.    Sources close to the case said Freeman's decision to plead guilty was  influenced by the guilty verdict last month in the Princeton/Newport Limited  Partners racketeering and securities fraud trial. James Sutton Regan, the  firm's managing general partner and a close friend of Freeman's, was convicted  on all counts along with five other defendants. One source said the verdict  ""discouraged Freeman.""      Subjected to 'Innuendoes'    But in his resignation letter, Freeman strongly denied that he was involved in  any broad-ranging conspiracy. Freeman's lawyers and Goldman Sachs, in separate  statements, noted that the single charge filed Thursday was far narrower than  the broad insider trading conspiracy alleged in an indictment returned in 1987.  Freeman's lawyers, Paul J. Curran and Robert B. Fiske Jr., both former U.S.  attorneys in Manhattan, said in a written statement that ""Mr. Freeman continues  to deny categorically the conspiracy allegations upon which he was arrested and  indicted in 1987.""    Goldman Sachs, in a letter to its employees, said: ""We do not condone even a  single act of wrongdoing."" But the firm said Freeman was subjected to ""a series  of highly publicized formal allegations and innuendoes that far exceed anything  he actually did.""    Freeman faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to  $1.86 million, representing twice the amount that the government claims Freeman  received in financial benefit from the illegal trades. U.S. Magistrate Nina  Gershon allowed him to remain free without imposing any bail.    The indictment against Freeman, Tabor and Wigton was dropped after prosecutors  acknowledged that they weren't prepared to go to trial. At the time, Giuliani  had promised that a new indictment would be brought against all three ""in  record time."" Prosecutors in 1987 stated in court that the original charges  amounted only to ""the tip of the iceberg.""    Stanley Arkin, Wigton's lawyer, praised the decision to drop the investigation  of his client. ""It's about time,"" he said. ""The arrest and what happened to him  was one of the most egregious events in recent history in terms of law  enforcement."" Without specifically naming Giuliani, Arkin said the person  responsible for the arrest and indictment ""owes him (Wigton) a devout apology.""    Andrew Lawler, Tabor's lawyer, was on vacation Thursday. But in a written  statement, he said the arrest and indictment of Tabor had caused ""incalculable  personal and professional damage."" Lawler said: ""A thorough investigation would  have established, and indeed has established, that Mr. Tabor is innocent of any  wrongdoing."" Lawler, however, praised Romano's decision to announce publicly  that the investigation had been ended.      No Comment From Giuliani    Tabor, 36, was said to be working as a computer software consultant. He didn't  respond Thursday to a request for an interview. Wigton also couldn't be reached  for comment.    Giuliani's campaign press spokesman failed to return three phone calls from a  reporter seeking comment on Thursday. Giuliani had said previously, however,  that the arrests may have been unduly hasty.    Romano said he didn't believe that the investigation marked a setback for the  government. Referring to Freeman's agreement to plead guilty, Romano said: ""We  have a substantial criminal charge lodged against a very significant member of  the financial community.""    Jed Rakoff, Siegel's lawyer, said the end of the Freeman, Tabor and Wigton  investigation clears the way for Siegel to be sentenced.      Photo, Robert M.

Freeman said he received illegal inside information from Siegel in the form of  a brief remark confirming the accuracy of the rumor. Freeman said Siegel told  him ""Your bunny has a good nose."" Based on that remark, Freeman ordered the  sale of additional Beatrice options.    The snag turned out to be a change in the structure of the deal, in which  holders of Beatrice stock would be given less cash than originally envisioned.  When the restructuring was disclosed publicly, the price of Beatrice stock fell  by more than $4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    The guilty plea marked an abrupt reversal by Freeman. For more than two years,  he strongly maintained that he was innocent of any wrongdoing. In public  statements, Goldman Sachs also had vigorously defended Freeman and kept him on  its staff.    Sources close to the case said Freeman's decision to plead guilty was  influenced by the guilty verdict last month in the Princeton/Newport Limited  Partners racketeering and securities fraud trial. James Sutton Regan, the  firm's managing general partner and a close friend of Freeman's, was convicted  on all counts along with five other defendants. One source said the verdict  ""discouraged Freeman.""      Subjected to 'Innuendoes'    But in his resignation letter, Freeman strongly denied that he was involved in  any broad-ranging conspiracy. Freeman's lawyers and Goldman Sachs, in separate  statements, noted that the single charge filed Thursday was far narrower than  the broad insider trading conspiracy alleged in an indictment returned in 1987.  Freeman's lawyers, Paul J. Curran and Robert B. Fiske Jr., both former U.S.  attorneys in Manhattan, said in a written statement that ""Mr. Freeman continues  to deny categorically the conspiracy allegations upon which he was arrested and  indicted in 1987.""    Goldman Sachs, in a letter to its employees, said: ""We do not condone even a  single act of wrongdoing."" But the firm said Freeman was subjected to ""a series  of highly publicized formal allegations and innuendoes that far exceed anything  he actually did.""    Freeman faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to  $1.86 million, representing twice the amount that the government claims Freeman  received in financial benefit from the illegal trades. U.S. Magistrate Nina  Gershon allowed him to remain free without imposing any bail.    The indictment against Freeman, Tabor and Wigton was dropped after prosecutors  acknowledged that they weren't prepared to go to trial. At the time, Giuliani  had promised that a new indictment would be brought against all three ""in  record time."" Prosecutors in 1987 stated in court that the original charges  amounted only to ""the tip of the iceberg.""    Stanley Arkin, Wigton's lawyer, praised the decision to drop the investigation  of his client. ""It's about time,"" he said. ""The arrest and what happened to him  was one of the most egregious events in recent history in terms of law  enforcement."" Without specifically naming Giuliani, Arkin said the person  responsible for the arrest and indictment ""owes him (Wigton) a devout apology.""    Andrew Lawler, Tabor's lawyer, was on vacation Thursday. But in a written  statement, he said the arrest and indictment of Tabor had caused ""incalculable  personal and professional damage."" Lawler said: ""A thorough investigation would  have established, and indeed has established, that Mr. Tabor is innocent of any  wrongdoing."" Lawler, however, praised Romano's decision to announce publicly  that the investigation had been ended.      No Comment From Giuliani    Tabor, 36, was said to be working as a computer software consultant. He didn't  respond Thursday to a request for an interview. Wigton also couldn't be reached  for comment.    Giuliani's campaign press spokesman failed to return three phone calls from a  reporter seeking comment on Thursday. Giuliani had said previously, however,  that the arrests may have been unduly hasty.    Romano said he didn't believe that the investigation marked a setback for the  government. Referring to Freeman's agreement to plead guilty, Romano said: ""We  have a substantial criminal charge lodged against a very significant member of  the financial community.""    Jed Rakoff, Siegel's lawyer, said the end of the Freeman, Tabor and Wigton  investigation clears the way for Siegel to be sentenced.      Photo, Robert M.

Religious and left-wing groups opposed the law's tough sanctions as infringements of human rights. They also feared it would foment anti-immigrant sentiment. But Swiss have been disturbed recently by the sight of misery at Zurich's open drug scene, rising violent crime and a threat from Lebanese dealers last August to start a bombing campaign in the city. Nearly three-quarters of those who voted supported the law. There were majorities in every canton, big ones everywhere except in Geneva. The law is aimed at stopping foreign drug dealers from taking advantage of the asylum law. Typically, these dealers throw their passports away after entering the country. Then they apply for political asylum and proceed to deal. If they are caught, the police can detain them only for 30 days. If their applications for asylum are still under consideration, they cannot easily be deported. When they finally do leave, relatives or friends replace them. The new law allows for detention of any foreigner found without identification for three months, and for a further nine months if he appeals against a deportation order. If the person is believed to constitute a threat to law and order, he can be ordered to keep away from specified areas. The new law is one of several measures which has been taken in the past three months following a radical reversal of Zurich's liberal policy towards its large drug addict community.

On April 4, Libya and Chad signed an agreement concerning  the  practical modalities for the implementation of the judgment  delivered by the international court of justice regarding the  Aouzou strip.    They agreed that the withdrawal of Libyan administration and  troops from Aouzou should start on April 15, under the  supervision of a mixed team of 25 Chadian officers, 25 Libyan  officers and UN observers.    Butrus-Ghali wrote to the Security Council Wednesday on his  intention to send a reconnaissance team to the area to conduct a  survey of conditions on the ground for the possible deployment  of UN observers to monitor the Libyan withdrawal.    Noting that the team would travel to Libya by UN aircraft,  the Security Council decided that paragraph 4 of Resolution 748,  which imposed sanctions, including aviation embargo, on Libya,  should not apply in respect of the UN aircraft flying to or from  Libya for the purpose of conveying the team.    Resolution 748 was adopted in March 1992 because of Libya's  refusal to hand over to the United States and Britain two Libyan  suspects for the Pan Am jet bombing over Scotland in 1988 which  killed 270 people.

Over the past two weeks the bosses of six leading families running large crime syndicates have been arrested or extradited, as in the case of the Cuntreras. These arrests attest to a tougher attitude by the Italian government following the brutal assassinations of the country's two principal anti-mafia magistrates, Mr Giovane Falcone and Mr Paolo Borsellino. This tougher attitude has led to many an ironic comment about the authorities' previous complicity in allowing them to be free. But it is also the result of increased use of 'super-grass' testimony from former mafia members. Another factor is believed to be increased rivalry between clans operating organised crime syndicates. Some press commentaries have also speculated that those being caught after being on the wanted list for up to 10 years are no longer significant figures and have been pushed aside by new clans. The Italian government had previously submitted three extradition requests to the Venezuelan government - in 1983, 1985 and 1990 - for Pasquale, Paolo and Gaspare Cuntrera. All were denied. In the final days before his assassination in June, Mr Borsellino had been on their trail, while the late Mr Falcone had always insisted on the importance of bringing them to justice.

Australian officials said US president George Bush endorsed the plans in a letter to Mr Paul Keating, prime minister and also supported the establishment of a permanent Apec secretariat. Mr Keating proposed upgrading Apec on a visit to Indonesia last month. The plan was received cautiously by President Suharto, and is thought to be regarded with suspicion by other south-east Asian nations. Malaysia, in particular, has opposed Australian attempts to strengthen Apec because of concerns that it might undermine the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean). Asean, grouping Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the Philippines, is planning a south-east Asian free trade zone in response to the emergence of trading blocs in Europe and North America. Apec, launched two years ago by Mr Bob Hawke, former Australian prime minister, was envisaged as a forum for informal discussion of regional trade and development. However, the process has become an symbol of Australia's increasing trade and foreign policy focus on the Asia/Pacific region since Mr Keating replaced Mr Hawke last year. Mr Keating has increased pressure on the US to keep a security presence in the region. In recent talks with Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, Mr Keating supported continuation of US facilities in Australia, and offered use of a bombing range when the US leaves the Philippines this year.

The MAINICHI SHIMBUN quoted a senior U.S. official as saying  that attacking North Korea's nuclear facilities would be very  difficult, although President Bill Clinton and Defense Secretary  Les Aspin had said they would not rule out military action  against the communist country.    The Pentagon has been looking into possible options,  including a pre-emptive air strike, with the understanding that  military action will be difficult if Pyongyang acquires nuclear  weapons, the U.S. official said.    But Washington came to the conclusion that it is impossible  to destroy North Korea's nuclear facilities with missiles or  bombs if they are moved underground, he said.    Bombardment of reactors or nuclear fuel storage sites was  ruled out as it is most likely to result in a release of  radioactivity, he said.    In addition, Washington had to consider the possibility of  Pyongyang's retaliating and devastating South Korea, the  MAINICHI observed.    Seoul is a strong opponent of an attack and, considering all  of the odds, a military attack on North Korea's nuclear  facilities is highly unlikely, the newspaper commented.    The Japanese daily noted there were calls for an air attack  if the situation worsens from conservative U.S. congressmen and  some military experts, but they lost ground with Washington's  reaching this conclusion.

By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      In an unusual twist on a Mother's Day tribute, Ventura County Dist. Atty.  Michael D. Bradbury held his annual roundup of deadbeat dads on Saturday,  arresting nine of 148 fathers wanted for back child support payments.    While he was at it, Bradbury set his sights on eight deadbeat moms. But  investigators were unable to track down any of the mothers.    Armed with their share of 156 arrest warrants, 15 teams of two investigators  set out around the county shortly after 6 a.m. Most teams found bad addresses,  nobody home or a brother, mother or friend claiming that they no longer knew  the whereabouts of the wanted person.    Occasionally, however, the investigators got lucky.    ""They never would have got me if I hadn't had that cup of Mom's coffee,"" said  Keith Edward Baldwin, 32, of Oxnard. Baldwin, who owes $21,814 to the state to  help support his 3-year-old son, had stopped by his parents' house on his way  to a cement pumping job shortly after 7 a.m.    Clad in faded blue jeans and a red sleeveless jersey with the number 32 on the  front, Baldwin was handcuffed and brought to Oxnard City Hall. There, a  sheriff's van waited to take him and other arrestees to the county jail in  Ventura for booking.    The media, called in by Bradbury to help publicize his determination to collect  back child support, also greeted Baldwin at his unceremonious arrival.    ""This isn't exactly the way I want to make the news,"" said Baldwin as  photographers recorded him bending his tall frame to climb into the back of the  van. ""It would have been better, maybe, if I was saving somebody's life.""    Baldwin cheered quickly, however, when he recognized the next prisoner who was  ushered into the back of the van. The two men laughed and greeted each other.  How are they acquainted? ""Deadbeats,"" Baldwin said.    Saturday's blitz marked the eighth of Bradbury's annual roundups, which are  usually held closer to Father's Day than Mother's Day. At a news conference  Friday, Bradbury said the roundups are valuable in part for the arrests made  both during and after the sweep but primarily for the publicity they generate.    ""We want to re-emphasize the need to support children. And if you don't, you're  going to go to jail,"" Bradbury told reporters.    Ventura County ranks top in the state for collections of back child support  payments compared to the money spent on welfare, Bradbury said.    The nine arrested Saturday had a collective debt of $121,744, said C. Stanley  Trom, who heads the Child Support Division of Bradbury's office.    Trom said nine arrests out of 156 warrants ranks among the worst capture rates  in the history of the roundups. Nine more people, including one woman, called  investigators Saturday afternoon when they learned of the warrants for their  arrests, and their voluntary surrender will bring the success rate up, Trom  said.    He expects 20 to 30 additional calls from the outstanding warrants during the  coming week, he said.    Both Bradbury and Trom stressed that Saturday's roundup is part of an effort  that continues throughout the year. On a daily basis, three investigators  instead of 30 are out arresting people on warrants.    The other investigators are looking for clues to people's whereabouts,  preparing cases for trial, working on liens against homes or attachments to  wages, Trom said.    Countywide, about 4,000 delinquent parents owe $71 million in back payments.  About half of that money is owed to the state, which has provided welfare for  the support of children, Trom said. The other half is owed directly to spouses  or caretakers.    The 156 people for whom investigators searched on Saturday accounted for more  than $2 million of the overdue child support debt in the county, Trom said.    Typically the mothers who owe support were young and unwed when they had their  babies, Trom said. In many cases, they left their children with relatives or  neighbors and did not return at the promised hour or day. When the new  caretakers apply for state assistance to pay for the child's upbringing, the  state seeks to recover the money from the mother.    For fathers, however, there is no typical case, Bradbury said.    ""They defy profiling,"" Bradbury said. ""People come from all walks of life.  There is an attorney in San Francisco whom we have an enforcement action  against.""    Deputy Dist. Atty. Colleen White noted one general exception to Bradbury's  no-profile statement.

He asked Congress for Dollars 172m to hire up to 600 more border patrol agents and boost efforts to stop immigrant-smugglers and intercept smuggling ships at sea. 'It's certainly plain to anybody with eyes to see that the border patrol is drastically understaffed, breathtakingly understaffed,' Mr Clinton said. He also called for a process of 'expedited exclusion' which would allow officials to rule summarily on asylum requests, instead of allowing asylum-seekers to stay for months while their cases are judged. Anyone trying to smuggle in aliens would face anti-racketeering charges and doubled prison sentences. In recent months, there have been a series of attempts to land illegal immigrants by ship. The measures have also been prompted by doubts about the effectiveness of US consular officials in screening visa applicants for terrorist links. There is the recent case of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, a militant Moslem preacher, several of whose followers have been arrested in connection with the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New York. Sheikh Omar is in custody awaiting deportation proceedings, although he entered the US legally on a visa issued after a CIA review. Mr Clinton insisted the US was not seeking to close its doors to legal immigrants and would remain 'the world's greatest melting pot'. However, 'we must say no to illegal immigration so we can continue to say yes to legal immigration,' he said.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

An official of the  publication said that Ekpu and Mohamed were arrested in Lagos  and northern city of Lokoja at the weekend.    No official reason was given for their arrest by state  security officials, which followed the arrest Thursday [7 April]  of the magazine's editor-in-chief, Dan Agbese. The arrests are  believed to be in connection with last week's NEWSWATCH  interview with an official of the old administration of Gen.  Ibrahim Babangida which ruled from 1985 to 1992. [passage  omitted]    Some media and human rights organisations, in separate  statements after Agbese's arrest, condemned the action as a new  wave of media clampdown in the West African country, which is  acclaimed to have one of the freest press in Africa. The  organisations include the Nigerian Union of Journalists and the  Nigerian Magazine Publishers Association.    ""Events in the recent past have shown that unlawful  harassments of media practitioners have never achieved any  positive results for the government,"" the association said.    Agbese, Mohamed and Ekpu, left the NATIONAL CONCORD  publication of millionaire Moshood Abiola in 1983 to set up  NEWSWATCH, whose founding editor-in-chief, Dele Giwa was killed  in a parcel bomb delivered to his Lagos home in 1986.

Salmawi  wondered about the developments in that long-suffering fraternal  country and said that we all wonder if an end to Lebanon's  ordeal is in sight. Writer Lutfi al-Khuli then mentioned that  we need to learn more about the events in Lebanon since the  church bombing.    [Buwayz] Thank you, everyone. I think that the bombing of  Sayyidat al-Najat Church, which came on the heels of the  explosion in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, was aimed at diverting  attention from the latter explosion and rechanneling the  attention of the international media. Another goal of the  church bombing was to provoke the locals and lead them into  thinking that the bombing was the doing of the resistance. A  third motive was to incite Christians into demanding a change in  the relations between Lebanon and Syria. I think that these  were the motives behind the church bombing. It was a  provocative and conspiratorial act.    Immediately after the investigations began it became clear  that the above impressions were justified. I arrived at the  scene just 20 minutes after the explosion, which occurred in my  home town and electoral district. What I told you before were  my first impressions, and they were vindicated. A number of  individuals were arrested and they later confessed that they had  links with Israeli officers. They admitted to having met  Israeli officers in the border strip and to have received the  information, instructions, money, and equipment for carrying out  the bombing. Clearly, this was an attempt to disrupt the  situation in Lebanon. This is hardly a secret anymore.    I recall remarks made by the head of the Israeli negotiating  delegation to the effect that Israel finds the security equation  in Lebanon unacceptable, particularly the presence of the  resistance in the south, and will try to change it. About ten  days ago, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that Israel  cannot reach an understanding with Lebanon unless the current  relations between Lebanon and Syria change.    Therefore, it is clear that what is happening is an attempt  to change a number of domestic equations in order to promote  certain political interests. True, the Lebanese were known  during the war to be susceptible to infighting and to foreign  plots and intervention, but this time the country's reaction was  very mature. As a result, the bombing failed to create a  factional division or spark sectarian strife.    The nation was almost unanimous that unity should be  maintained. The public was aware that those who perpetrated this  atrocity wanted to revive internal strife here. I believe that  the nation has passed that test in good form, helped to no small  extent by the progress in the investigations. I am a lawyer and  therefore cannot prejudge things, but it seems that the evidence  gathered in the case and the statements of the detainees have  pieced together a clear picture. [passage omitted]    [Dr. Halah Mustafa] My question concerns the future  political impact of Hizballah's presence in Lebanon. It has two  parts: First, what effect will Hizballah's armed operations in  the south have on the future of the peace process, specifically  the Lebanese-Israeli peace process? Second, what is the nature  of Hizballah's relations with the legitimate authorities in  Lebanon? Because, given its ideological and political structure  and its well known regional links, Hizballah may pose a real  challenge to the authorities in the post-peace agreement era.  Will the authorities in Lebanon be able to control this party  in the future?    [Buwayz] In Lebanon Hizballah is part of the resistance. In  fact, this party was established on the basis of certain  commitments. Despite its ideological premises based on applying  the Islamic shar'iah, Hizballah realizes that it is impossible  to achieve its goal in Lebanon as long as Lebanon is a unified  country. Thus, Hizballah's ideology takes the Lebanese situation  into account and perhaps it is trying not to aggravate this  situation as long as they need Lebanon to remain a unified  homeland for all its sons and sects. Hizballah cannot impose  its own interests on other sects. Regarding the second part of  the question, I believe it is wrong to say that resistance  should stop before guarantees are obtained on the return of  southern Lebanon, because the resistance is not the reason for  the occupation. The resistance emerged as a result of the  Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and not vice versa. There  would not have been any resistance had it not been for the  occupation of part of Lebanon. The crux of the issue is the  resistance, which was founded on a clear and just basis--that  is, Israel's occupation of one-tenth of Lebanese territory,  apart from its daily actions and arrests. It seems that no one  wants to know that there are 400 Lebanese detainees in Israeli  jails who have not been visited by any international  organization.    The resistance is sometimes a manifestation of international  impotence. The Lebanese Government is being asked to restrict  or abolish the resistance; Israel constantly requests this. We  say: How can the state abolish the resistance when it has no  guarantees? This means that the Lebanese Government is being  asked to become a suburb of the Israeli occupation. This might  trigger a permanent civil war in Lebanon between those who  believe that resistance is a legitimate right as long as  Lebanese territory is occupied and those who want to end the  resistance. Therefore the Lebanese Government will not enter  into internal strife over this issue. The Lebanese Government's  stand is that since Israel maintains that it has no designs on a  single inch of Lebanese territory or one cubic meter of Lebanese  water, a joint military committee can be formed to discuss a  timetable for withdrawal as well as all security requirements in  the south. This committee could also discuss hopes for the  future. The Government could then say that there is a plan to  liberate the south and that the resistance is preventing  liberation. The resistance would then look like a hindrance to  liberation instead of the only means of liberation. Israel  continues to ask us why we do not commit ourselves to ending the  resistance. We are not saying that we will not agree to take  control of the security situation in the south until the last  Israeli soldier withdraws. In stage two, a joint security  committee could decide to link withdrawal to the establishment  of security and stability. The Government will then be  responsible for any violation originating on Lebanese territory.  Certainly the resistance is not a military problem for Lebanon.  For the Lebanese state, the resistance is a political issue.  When the political side of this problem is solved, there will  be no problem. [passage omitted]    [Ahmad Nafi'] It was noticed that the issue of deploying  the Army in the south was raised during U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's visit to Lebanon to speed up the resumption  of the peace negotiations. Talk about this issue then stopped.  It is being said that there is still a plan for the Army's  deployment in the south. What effect would this have on  speeding up the implementation of Resolution 425?    [Buwayz] There is a fundamental point that we did not touch  on when we spoke about the al-Ta'if accord and its achievements.  The al-Ta'if accord allowed the state to build up the  establishments. The Lebanese Army numbered no more than 10,000  soldiers and its armament was very weak when the civil war  ended. The army now has around 40,000 soldiers and we can say  that it is now a respectable force. Overall the Armed Forces  now number 70,000 if we include the internal security forces and  some other organs.    One of the achievements of the al-Ta'if accord is that it  allowed Lebanon to rebuild its institutions. All the militias  have been dissolved. Everyone recognizes that this is not a  military problem, but a political one. Looked at from this  angle, the Army's deployment in the south has dispelled the  fears. It is not a military problem but a political one.    [Muhammad Salmawi] Has a decision been made in Lebanon to  concede the resistance card?    [Buwayz] The consequences of making a premature decision and  the absence of Israeli guarantees would create an internal  problem, and perhaps even a civil war in Lebanon between the  resistance's supporters and opponents. The state has not looked  at this issue yet. What we are saying now is that the cabinet  has decided to order the Army to deploy on all the Lebanese  territory. But the deployment so far is limited to part of  Beirut and other areas -- that is, to around 65 percent of  Lebanon's territory. Four days ago, the Cabinet expanded the  Army's deployment. This means that the internal security  situation will be under full control. But the decision does not  mean stopping the resistance.    [Amin Muhammad Amin] There is supposedly a link between the  Syrian peace track and the Syrian presence in Lebanon. Does  such a link in fact exist or is this a mere Israeli assertion?    [Buwayz] There is a real and known link, but this linkage is  Israel's and is not new. This linkage was first made after the  17 May 1985 agreement when the Lebanese negotiator had  negotiated at length with the Israeli side. When they broached  the issue of withdrawal from the south, the Israelis linked all  these terms to Syria's approval and blessing of the agreement.  That was not the first time that Israel had made the linkage.  I will explain how Israel concocts the linkage. We tell  Israel: UN Resolution 425 has been passed, so please implement  it. In return, the Lebanese Government will pledge to impose  full security and stability on both sides of the border. This  resolution has nothing to do with regional developments and is  independent of a peace agreement. This resolution demands  Israel's withdrawal and says that the Lebanese state is  responsible for security and stability. It is an independent  resolution. We are and remain Arabs. So what is the Israeli  reply? They say that Israel will withdraw only after the  signing of a peace agreement with Lebanon, the peace agreement  that involves recognition and relations. It says: To implement  Resolution 425, the Lebanese state first has to impose security  and stability. We will sign a peace with you when all the Arab  problems are resolved and agreement is reached with the  Palestinians, Syrians, and Jordanians. A separate peace  agreement with Lebanon is impossible as long as this conflict is  a comprehensive Arab effort and as long as this peace and its  establishment can only be built on the general principles of the  peace process. We say that Israel must withdraw in  implementation of Resolution 425; and when progress is made with  the Palestinians, Syrians, and Jordanians, we will, in  solidarity with them, sign a full peace agreement with Israel.  As you can see, it is Israel who links the situation in the  south to the overall situation in the region and to the Syrian  track in particular.    There is no link between Syria's presence and Israeli's. We  believe the Syrian Army's presence in Lebanon to be necessary  for a while to help the state rebuild its institutions and  impose security and stability. We regard the Israeli Army's  presence as an occupation that is opposed by all Lebanese. We  needed the presence of an army at one stage but this need is  decreasing daily since we have rebuilt our institutions, but  there is an occupation that is creating a political crisis, an  occupation in the full sense of the word. As far as we are  concerned, this occupation is illegal. Politically and  regionally, when Israel withdraws from the south, then there  might be no justification for the presence of any foreign army  in Lebanon, depending on the political and psychological  conditions.    Legally, of course, we refuse to equate these two presences.  [passage omitted]     "

Commenting on remarks by Albanian President  Sali Berisha, according to which the Greek minority in Albania  enjoys better conditions than other minorities in the Balkans,  the government spokesman noted that Albania's constitutional  status is vague, particularly on issues of education and  religious rights for minorities. Declarations are not enough,  Venizelos stressed, and continued: There is a need for the  appropriate legislative, administrative and police practices,  and the latest arrests of Greek-Albanians do not offer  guarantees. The spokesman added that during the meeting in  Zurich between Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and his  Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi, the Greek foreign minister  raised the issue of respect for human rights and within this  framework, he mentioned the continued detention of the Albanian  Socialist Party leader Fatos Nano.    Venizelos expressed the hope that New Democracy Chairman  Miltiadhis Evert, who will visit the North Epirus area on  Saturday and Sunday, will promote the government positions on  these issues by fully understanding his responsibility in  handling similar issues. Evert's visit is for the purpose of  receiving a direct and on-the-spot briefing regarding the  problems faced by the Greeks in Gjirokaster, Sarande, and  Himare. According to a New Democracy statement, Evert will only  ask to visit Tirana if the Greeks arrested recently in Albania  are released.     "

ATTACKS MAY BE LINKED TO  NAACP TEAR GAS INCIDENT.      By LEE MAY and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      ATLANTA      A bomb was safely removed from the building housing the federal 11th Circuit  Court of Appeals on Monday, but a Savannah attorney was killed when another  bomb exploded in his office. The fatal blast came two days after the package  bomb murder of an 11th Circuit judge in Alabama.    In Birmingham, Ala., where authorities were investigating the bombing that  killed U.S. Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance on Saturday, FBI Agent Tom Moore  said: ""The preliminary investigation (in Savannah) indicates strong  similarities to the other explosive devices in Birmingham and Atlanta.""    The FBI said the attacks might be linked to the August, 1989, tear gas bombing  of the NAACP's regional headquarters in Atlanta. Special Agent William Hinshaw  said in Savannah that the agency is warning lawyers, judges and NAACP activists  in Georgia and Alabama to be suspicious of strange packages.    In Atlanta, frightened employees were evacuated from the five-story downtown  court building before the device discovered there early in the day was disarmed  by munitions experts. Security was tightened at other federal buildings in  Atlanta.    Authorities said that the Atlanta bomb had been found in a package in the  courthouse mail room. They refused to say to whom it was addressed but said it  resembles the powerful device that killed Vance and severely injured his wife,  Helen, at their Mountain Brook, Ala., home in the Birmingham suburbs.    Investigators said they are exploring a possible connection between the Atlanta  and Birmingham bombs. Officials said that the two incidents have been placed at  the top of the FBI's list of investigations.    ""I can assure you, we will leave no stone unturned,"" FBI agent Allen P.  Whitaker told a news conference in Birmingham.    Jim Holland, a postal inspector, told the same news conference that ""there  could be a significant connection between the two packages.""    In Savannah, attorney Robert Robinson, a black civil rights activist and city  alderman, died after undergoing emergency surgery for injuries he suffered in  the bomb blast in his office around 5 p.m., officials said.    Robinson, 42, ""lost his right arm, his left hand and some upper body tissue and  (had) severe damage to his legs,"" according to a fellow alderman, Floyd Adams.    A federal official who assisted in the investigation of the Savannah attack  described the ""grisly"" scene in Robinson's office in the city's historic  district, where the bomb blew a rectangular hole in the attorney's second-floor  desk.    ""It would have been difficult to imagine anyone surviving that attack,"" said  the official, Lance Hearns, an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms.    Hearns said the package had been delivered in the regular mail just before noon  Monday, but that Robinson had not collected it until he returned to the office.    ""He carried it upstairs to his private office,"" Hearns said. ""It was a very  unfortunate scene.""    At a Savannah news conference late Monday, FBI agent Bob DeLoach said it was  ""definitely a possibility"" that white supremacists had sent the bomb that  killed Robinson.    Agent Hinshaw said the FBI also warned the NAACP that the attacks appear to be  related to the Aug. 22, 1989, tear-gas mail bomb attack at the NAACP's Atlanta  offices, in which eight people, including an infant, were injured.    The caustic gas bomb was sent to the civil rights organization via Postal  Service ""Priority Mail."" It was addressed only to the NAACP, not to any  individual, and had a phony return address.    Several investigators in Birmingham trying to find clues to Vance's murder were  immediately dispatched to Atlanta Monday. Both the Atlanta and Birmingham  devices are said to be ""nail bombs,"" in which nails are packed into an  explosive device, and both were delivered through the mail. In addition to the  FBI, the Marshals Service and Postal Service, the federal Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms and local police officers and sheriff's deputies are  taking part in the investigations.    Authorities continued to comb court records, looking for cases that could  provide motives for the judge's slaying.    The 12-member 11th Circuit handles federal appeals from Alabama, Georgia and  Florida, and the bulk of the circuit's caseload is drug-related. Investigators  said that they are ruling out no possibility, including the theory that  Colombian cocaine bosses may be behind the murder.    However, in Washington, a senior official who is close to the investigation  went to great lengths to play down that possibility, asserting that all the  characteristics of the bombing make it unlikely.    ""None of it seems to match what you would expect from trained killers trying to  deliver a message,"" the official said.    Another official said, ""I don't think it makes any sense. You look at  motivation in this business, and the only person who says, 'I'd like to get rid  of that appeals court judge,' is a trial court judge who has been reversed (by  the appellate court jurist).""    The official, emphasizing that he was being facetious to make a point, said  that appellate court judges ""are, by and large, a pretty faceless people. You  have to look very carefully at a newspaper report of their decisions to see who  wrote them. It wouldn't make a point"" for Colombian drug kingpins to be going  after an appellate court judge, he said.    A knowledgeable source said Monday night that several federal judges in Florida  had received anonymous telephone calls from a man with a Spanish accent on the  afternoon that Vance was killed.    According to the source, the caller asked each of the judges whether Vance were  there and then hung up. Not until they learned later that Vance had been  assassinated did the Florida judges suspect that the calls may have been meant  as a warning, the source said.    Although investigators have refused to disclose details about the mail bombs, a  source close to the investigation disclosed that the package sent to Vance bore  the return address of Judge Lewis R. Morgan, a colleague on the 11th Circuit.    On seeing the familiar name on the brown-paper-wrapped box, Mrs. Vance said to  her husband: ""Look, here's a package from Judge Morgan,"" said the source, who  is familiar with what the widow told investigators.    ""I wonder if he's sending me some more magazines like he did last year,"" Vance  responded. Moments later, the bomb exploded.    Vance was only the third federal judge to be killed in this century.    The judge, who was highly praised as a scholar and as a person, has been  controversial at times. In 1985, he told a lawyer trying to prevent deportation  of 1,500 Cuban refugees that the U.S. government ""can keep the detainees in the  Atlanta pen until they die.""    That same year, he was on a panel that cleared the way for prosecution of Ku  Klux Klansmen in a violent 1979 confrontation with black civil rights marchers  in Decatur.    No one has claimed responsibility for the judge's murder, the Savannah bombing  or the placing of the Atlanta bomb.    The Atlanta bomb was discovered shortly after 9:30 Monday morning in the court  building's mail room during an X-ray examination of mail. Pictures of it showed  what ""looked like electric wires,"" a mail room employee said.    Court officials telephoned authorities, who carefully examined the device,  taking fingerprints and other information that could help identify the bomb's  sender. At around noon, a member of the Atlanta police bomb squad, along with  an FBI official, emerged from the building carrying the device. They loaded it  onto a red truck, which sped away under police escort as bystanders looked on.    The bomb was taken to a site near the police academy, where it was safely  defused late Monday afternoon. Officials said that they will examine the  device, part by part.    FBI agent Whitaker said that the Atlanta bomb was addressed ""to someone in the  court system,"" but he refused to elaborate. One source close to the  investigation said that the bomb package carried the return address of an  Atlanta attorney, but he refused to disclose the name, saying, ""It's being  checked out.""    In the wake of the incidents, law enforcement officials have extended their  precautionary warnings beyond judges to other court employees and their  families. ""We have notified court families to use procedures"" that include  screening any items they receive at home or work, Marshal Thomas C. Greene told  the Birmingham news conference.    Security measures were heightened at federal courthouses around the country  Monday.    In Los Angeles, about two-thirds of Los Angeles' 30 federal District Court  judges met with the U.S. Marshal, officials of the U.S. Postal Service and the  Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad at the federal courthouse to discuss  security procedures.    Judge Terry T. Hatter said the meeting was useful but that he didn't plan to do  anything dramatically different. ""We're going to be more cautious, that's just  using common sense,"" he said.    U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said, ""I don't think (the Vance killing)  is going to intimidate any judge in this country. We have a lot of confidence  in the Marshals Service.""    U.S. Marshal Samuel Cicchino would not divulge what had been discussed in the  meeting with the judges and said there would be no major changes in security at  the U.S. courthouse. For years, all persons entering the building from Spring  Street or Main Street have been required to pass through a metal detector, and  every piece of mail and every package that arrives at the courthouse is put  through an X-ray machine.    Cicchino said that on Monday one box that looked suspicious on an X-ray machine  was opened by the police bomb squad. He said it turned out to be a package of  Christmas cookies.    The marshal said that any person who receives an unordered package or anything  else in the mail that looks suspicious should call the 911 emergency number and  ask for help.    In San Francisco, the headquarters of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,  clerks diverted all mail for appellate judges to the main federal courthouse,  where it was X-rayed. Court of Appeals judges were given the option of having  their personal mail checked, Mark Mendenhall, assistant executive for the  circuit court, said.    Clerks were ""taking very seriously"" the possibility of violence and were  seeking authorization for a screening device for mail and personnel.    ""We'd like them in place today,"" Mendenhall said. ""Working through Washington  takes longer than today.""    In Chicago, the U.S. Marshal's office said it had taken several specific  additional security measures at the federal courthouse but would not spell them  out. Because of previous terrorist trials in Chicago and sensitive gang  prosecutions, security at Chicago courts is already at a relatively high level.    In a related development, the Associated Press reported that Florida Gov. Bob  Martinez, who said his life has been threatened by Colombian drug barons, said  Monday that, as a result of Vance's assassination, he will consider wearing a  bulletproof vest. Martinez said he would reevaluate his previous refusal to  follow the advice of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which had urged  the governor to wear the vest during some public appearances.

Marine  Police South Division commander at Aberdeen John Cox said  importing illegals was big business for snakeheads, but the  involvement of Hong Kong residents in the practice had died down  dramatically.    ""Hong Kong people were heavily involved in the smuggling of  IIs [illegal immigrants] here in the 1980s but we haven't  arrested a Hong Kong person in connection with this sort of  thing in a long time,"" Mr Cox said. He said the preferred  smuggling route now seemed to be by sea.    Last year, police arrested 21,003 illegals arriving by boat,  compared with 12,373 using overland routes. In 1992, 17,891  were arrested arriving by sea and 15,812 by land. In 1991, only  10,023 were arrested arriving by sea and 14,066 by land.    Mr Cox said Hong Kong smugglers had virtually abandoned the  illegal immigrant trade in favour of smuggling electrical  products, which were much more profitable. ""I don't know what  the Chinese officials are doing to combat snakeheads, but it's  hard for us to do anything about them.""    Last year, 37,517 illegal immigrants were arrested--an  increase of more than 5 per cent on the 35,645 illegals arrested  in 1992. Police said the arrests reflected a small percentage of  illegals entering the territory.     "
0,FT933-9290 ,"FT933-9290 _AN-DHKB7ABHFT 930811   FT  11 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: General Accident   Since General Accident started to increase UK premium rates ahead of other composite insurers, it has consistently been furthest down the road towards underwriting profitability. Its solvency ratio of 47 per cent is now comfortable, but the company can still not afford to sacrifice underwriting profits in pursuit of market share. If that makes GA a leading indicator of UK insurers' resolve to make a decent return on underwriting, yesterday's interim figures contain a warning for the sector. Modest second-quarter underwriting profits are encouraging from personal motor and home insurance business and - were it not for the IRA bombing campaign in the City - from commercial property. Higher premiums and tighter underwriting standards are having the desired effect. But GA can see no room for additional rate rises in its more profitable lines of business. That leaves scope for perhaps another year of rising underwriting profits as the most recent price increases work through. By this time next year, though, competition may already be eroding those gains. With its business in the US, Canada and Europe still losing money at an underwriting level, there is scope for recovery elsewhere. Like other insurers GA also points to its investment return in addition to the underwriting result to give a measure of total performance. The recent rally in the sector has certainly been driven by expectations of investment gains from rising stock and bond markets.

The report cites  interviews with three defecting Libyan officers, who are in a  Scandinavian country after fleeing Libya when their military  plot against the al-Qadhdhafi regime was discovered.    The report begins by saying that three Libyan officers  managed to flee Libya after participating in the ""October  uprising"" events. It adds: They are, perhaps, the only members  of the secret military organization who escaped the arrests and  managed to reach safety after having traveled for five months in  Arab and foreign countries, and they are now members of ""the  National Front for the Salvation of Libya.""    The three defecting Libyan officers, whom AL-HAYAH met in a  Scandinavian country, are:    1. Lieutenant Colonel pilot Muhammad Bashir Salih, 36, born  in Bani Walid, who joined the Libyan Army in 1978 and received  training in Yugoslavia and Russia. He says that in 1988 he  considered playing a role that would effect a change in Libya,  and that he joined a secret military organization led by Major  'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir in 1991 after the latter talked to him  about this organization.    2. Major 'Abd-al-Salam al-Wa'ir, 38, born in Bani Walid.    3. Captain Salim Dabnun Muhammad al-Wa'ir, 31, from Bani  Walid.    Lt. Col. Salih points out that ""the Libyan situation  compelled me to think in this way because we do not have a  state, institutions, laws, or a constitution."" Discussing the  role of the al-Warfallah tribe in the military rebellion, Maj.  al-Wa'ir says: ""The fact that most participants in this military  action belong to the al-Warfallah tribe does not mean that other  tribes did not take part."" He adds: ""As officers, we all agreed  to hand the authority over to a civilian if our movement  succeeded. He is Dr. Muhammad Yusuf al-Maqrif and he does not  belong to the al-Warfallah tribe.""    Regarding how this secret military organization was  established, Maj. al-Wa'ir says that he was the first one who  had the idea of establishing this organization. He adds: ""Since  my graduation in 1980, the Libyan Army has been sent on missions  whose objectives were not known to us. We fought in Chad and  Uganda, and in 1987 I stayed in Lebanon with the force of  volunteers to champion the so-called the nationalist and Islamic  forces and assist Palestinian organizations. In December 1988,  I returned to Libya and briefed a group of officers on the idea  of the organization. There were just five of us. Afterward, I  went back to Lebanon in 1990, and I met with Colonel Mustafa  Balqasim in an Arab state and briefed him on the organization.  We agreed that he would act in one direction and I would act in  another direction in absolute secrecy. I once again returned to  Libya at the end of 1991, and finalized the establishment of the  organization whose membership reached 10. I believe that the  number of members in Mustafa's organization was similar to ours.""    Discussing their story with the Salvation Front, Maj.  al-Wa'ir indicates that in 1992 he briefed Col. Balqasim on the  need to open a channel of communications with this front abroad  because ""it is the only effective faction, and because we  received news about it through smuggled newspapers or radios,  and also because the Front's members are known in Libya for  their honesty and efficiency. Balqsim concurred.""    Maj. al-Wa'ir adds that in 1993, a third organization led by  Colonel Miftah Qarrum, who suffers from leukemia, joined the two  organizations, and that ""following several contacts and  meetings, a plan of action was agreed, and was to be implemented  no later than the spring of 1994. I agreed with Balqasim and  Qarrum on the broad outlines of the program designed to topple  the regime and on the transitional period. There was one  objective; namely, to topple the regime and establish a  democratic constitutional state.""    Concerning the details of the coup attempt, Cap. al-Wa'ir  discloses that, according to the plan of action, military units  would move in Tripoli, Banghazi, Misratah, Tarhunah, Sabratah,  and Gharyan. He also revealed that the targets of the coupists  were the army command headquarters in Bab al-'Aziziyah, the  intelligence directorate, the al-Jamahiriyah security  commission, and centers belonging to a group of the Republican  Guard battalions. However, he adds, the Libyan regime  discovered the plan, so the coupists sought to implement the  plan on 15 October but the arrests and confrontations with the  regime began on 12 October, so the coup attempt failed.    The report cites Lt. Col. Salih as saying that on 12 October  the Libyan military intelligence arrested Col. Miftah Qarrum,  Col. Mustafa Balqasim, Major 'Ali al-Kakli, Major Khalil  al-Jadak, Major Ramadan al-'Ayhuri, and other officers.    Concluding, the report cites Major al-Wa'ir as refuting the  claims that the organization's officers recently shown on Libyan  television were spying for the United States and stressed that  these officers are honorable ones who were only agents working  for Libya.

But he did not deny that an indication to that effect might  have been given to Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein at an  unauthorised meeting. The government has acknowledged that two  unauthorised meetings did take place.    Sir Patrick's comments came before a BBC TV programme last  night which claimed a government representative had told Mr  McGuinness at a meeting three days after last year's Warrington  bombing that Britain's long-term intention was to pull out.    Speaking in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick said: ""Nobody has  ever been authorised to say on behalf of the British government  that the British government intends to withdraw from Northern  Ireland.""    A previously released Sinn Fein account of the meeting --  said to have taken place on March 23 last year -- made no  reference to a signal from the British representative that  Britain might withdraw.    Sinn Fein's account does refer to remarks by the  representative to the effect that ""the final solution is union.""    The representative said that Sir Patrick wanted Sinn Fein to  play a part in achieving a settlement for the province ""not  because he likes Sinn Fein but because it cannot work without  them.""    ""Any settlement not involving all of the people North and  South won't work,"" Sinn Fein's note added.     "

For fans at Sunday's Los Angeles Raiders-Chicago Bears football game, the  loudest message came from the four black-and-white jail buses sitting ominously  outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the army of police officers  stationed inside the stadium.    The most telling announcement was the one that greeted fans as they entered the  Coliseum, warning them that they were subject to searches for such contraband  as alcohol, bottles, cans and coolers.    ""The Coliseum and Raiders staff urge you to enjoy today's game,"" the 30-second  tape boomed on the loudspeaker, ""and remember, we're all on the same team.""    Is that any way to sell a rivalry between the Monsters of the Midway and the  rowdy Silver-and-Black clad Raiders -- who both entered the game unbeaten,  untied and unforgiving?    It is when your last home game was marred by a vicious beating that left one  fan of the opposing team hospitalized and local officials vowing to crack down.    Paul Albrecht, 35, a Pittsburgh Steelers fan who lives in Tucson, Ariz., was  kicked in the head and beaten the previous Sunday at the Coliseum as he walked  through a crowd of jeering Raiders fans. Albrecht remains in serious condition  at County-USC Medical Center. The man accused of assaulting him -- Shane  Geringer, 19, of Agoura -- is facing possible criminal charges of assault with  a deadly weapon with great bodily injury .    That incident outraged local politicians and law enforcement officials and led  to Sunday's crackdown. By game's end Sunday, the Los Angeles Police Department  reported 31 arrests for disturbing the peace and alcohol-related offenses.    About six of the arrests came during a fight that erupted on the concourse  level at the peristyle end of the Coliseum midway through the fourth quarter,  police said.    ""We sent about a half-dozen officers into the upper stands near tunnels 1, 2  and 3 to quell it,"" said LAPD Lt. Alan Kerstein, the officer in charge of the  off-duty security detail. ""Several people threw beer at officers.""    About half of the six are being held on suspicion of disorderly conduct and the  others for investigation of battery on a police officer.    Some of the combatants required treatment for cuts and bruises, Kerstein said.    Police said 88 other boisterous fans were escorted from the game after being  involved in arguments or minor scuffles.    With nearly 115 LAPD officers inside the Coliseum to supplement about 200  private security guards and more police outside the stadium, Moore said there  was little chance of a repeat of last Sunday's violence -- the most serious  single incident since the Raiders moved from Oakland in 1982.    Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said Sunday that he would ask the Coliseum  Commission on Wednesday to consider some kind of ban on alcohol sales, this  after witnessing the fourth-quarter skirmish between fans and police. ""This was  a crowd that was on its best behavior, and still the police could not control  the crowd,"" Yaroslavsky said. ""If the police can't defend themselves, then how  can a fan?""    For some of the 80,000-plus fans who witnessed the Raiders 24-10 victory, the  security crackdown was irksome -- especially to those who savor their  boisterous image as an extension of the Raiders' on-the-field rowdiness.    ""I think it's an overreaction,"" said one season ticket holder who asked not to  be identified. ""Why do you need all this police here hassling people? That  beating was an isolated incident.""    Others said they welcomed the scores of uniformed police.    ""If they start hitting each other, then take them to jail,"" said Eddie Martinez  of Pacoima. ""But if they are just high-fiving each other and yelling -- hey,  then let them go.""    During pregame tailgate parties in a parking lot, Martinez and his friends were  busy spray-painting Raiders slogans on a white convertible that had been  decorated with the distinctive blue-and-orange markings of the Bears and a team  pennant. In defense, its owner, Pat Perino, helped the cheering Raiders crowd  repaint his car.

0,FT933-15639 ,"FT933-15639 _AN-DGHCRABJFT 930708   FT  08 JUL 93 / Amnesty says abuses worsening      By REUTER      LONDON   THE TURMOIL which replaced the iron hand of Communist rule in parts of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union brought with it severe human rights violations last year, Amnesty International said in a report released today, Reuter reports from London. The pressure group said in its annual world report that 1992 'was an appalling year for human rights in Europe'. Right around the globe, killings, torture and ill-treatment persisted with few signs of improvement, it found, with 'governments continuing to put politics before people's lives'. The London-based organisation said: 'There are thousands of stories in this 350-page report of people whose lives have been destroyed by state persecution and injustice.' Amnesty said it feared the first United Nations human rights conference for 25 years, held in Vienna last month, would do little to help victims. 'When we compare the fine speeches and final document with the damning evidence of political repression in this report, it is clear governments have yet to prove the world conference will make a difference to the lives of people around the world.'

Support for Sa'idi-Sirjani by this group of broad-minded  individuals comes at a time when a number of so-called writers  in Iran have also tried to lobby for Sa'idi-Sirjani.    It is worth mentioning that Sa'idi-Sirjani has been charged  with smuggling of drugs and with corruption and was arrested a  while ago by antidrug officials.    One of these broad-minded persons who supports  Sa'idi-Sirjani  told our correspondent: The charges leveled against  Sa'idi-Sirjani are not unforgivable sins, as most of the writers  and broad-minded persons indulge in taking drugs.    In answer to a question on his views about the smuggling of  drugs, he said: The court should prove this charge.    When asked what was the meaning of the collecting of  signatures at home and abroad, he said: If the government  arrests people for these reasons, there are many who will be  concerned!    It may be mentioned that on 25 April the director general of  internal security of the Information Ministry announced in an  interview that Sa'idi-Sirjani and Niaz Kermani were members of  the SAVAK [shah's intelligence organization] and have admitted  to the transporting, distribution, and use of drugs. They have  also confessed to producing, stocking, and distributing liquor  and to immoral acts.     "

'In an exclusive interview to AL-JUMHURIYAH daily published  today' the Turkish official hoped that reoperation of the  pipeline which would be technically tested, would not exceed  this year's end.

Mr. Sanberk, heading the first ever official Turkish  delegation to visit Iraq since the end of the 30-state  aggression on Iraq confirmed the Turkish people's rising calls  for the government to offer all possible backing to Iraq and  that the Turkish government began to sense now, more than ever  before, the necessity of boosting bilateral ties, and intensive  visits by Turkish officials would be conducted over the coming  days, Mr. Ozdem added.    He added that the delegation had taken a clear picture of  Iraq's current need of spare parts and equipment that could be  provided by Turkey during and after the blockade.

George Deukmejian  to order full-time deployment of the National Guard along the Mexican border.    They also pledged to seek federal assistance for the unprecedented effort.    ""Until the Bush Administration demonstrates its commitment to provide  California with the resources we need . . . Californians will have to fight the  drug war on our own,"" said the plan's principal author, Rep. Mel Levine  (D-Santa Monica).      Would Join U.S. Agents    The plan would for the first time enlist hundreds of uniformed guardsmen as  permanent participants in the anti-drug effort. They would join federal agents  in searching suspicious cargo and surveying sensitive border crossings by land  and air.    The Guard patrol program would be designed to emulate Operation Border Ranger  II, a monthlong crackdown that resulted in hundreds of arrests and a number of  major drug busts last spring before being halted when a special federal subsidy  ran out.    The new plan's sponsors, the Los Angeles-area's six Democratic congressmen,  contend that the Bush Administration's refusal to provide the drug-ridden  region with emergency anti-narcotics assistance leaves the state with no choice  but to send out the Guard.    To help pay for the effort, Levine and the other congressmen said they will  introduce legislation guaranteeing at least $10 million in Defense Department  funding for National Guard operations in California this year.    But Levine urged Deukmejian to deploy the Guard even before the funding goes  through, saying: ""If we want to recapture our state from drug dealers, we must  do it ourselves.""    In Sacramento, Deukmejian told reporters that he had not yet seen the  Democratic proposal and could not comment on it.    But the second-ranking officer for the Army National Guard, Gen. William J.  Jefferds, said the service would object to any plan that requires anti-drug  operations to be conducted on a permanent basis.    ""Once it's permanent, you're compromised in your effort and the traffickers  will shift their operations elsewhere,"" said Jefferds, the deputy adjutant  general. By deploying guardsmen instead on a ""surging"" basis, the Guard could  maintain the element of surprise, he said.    Both the governor and the general made clear, however, that they would favor a  stepped-up National Guard role in anti-drug operations within the state.  Indeed, the Guard has already asked the Pentagon for $10.5 million in  assistance to underwrite proposed operations next year, they said.    That would mark more than a tenfold increase over the $990,000 in assistance  dispatched to the state earlier this year as part of a landmark effort to  integrate National Guard forces in drug-enforcement efforts across the country.    Nearly all of that money was spent in the Border Ranger II crackdown, in which  about 600 troops joined Customs Service and Drug Enforcement Administration  agents in inspecting shipments at major entry points and in surveying traffic  along suspected smuggling routes.    Federal officials declared the operation ""successful on every measure,"" noting  that it contributed to almost 500 drug-related arrests and the seizure of  nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine and more than 2,000 pounds of marijuana.    That success contrasted sharply with the experience of the original Operation  Border Ranger, which was canceled in 1988 after one of its first helicopter  patrols crashed, killing five sheriff's deputies and three guardsmen.    In unveiling his proposal to elevate the anti-drug operation to permanent  status, Levine acknowledged its potential danger. But he contended that the  ""benefits in terms of human lives and physical safety in our communities"" would  far outweigh ""the risks in that area.""    Although a number of California Republicans have been outspoken advocates of an  active National Guard role in the drug fight, none were asked to endorse the  Democratic proposal. One GOP congressmen, Rep. Duncan L. Hunter of Coronado,  said: ""I'm glad they finally got on board.""    The proposal appeared designed in large part to renew critical attention on the  Bush Administration's refusal so far to declare Los Angeles a ""high-intensity  drug-trafficking area,"" a designation that would enable the city to qualify for  emergency federal assistance.    While the Administration already has given such status to Washington, D.C., it  angered many California officials by deciding to wait until February before  deciding which other cities would be put in the special category.    In denouncing that decision Wednesday, the Democrats argued that the Mexican  border area and Los Angeles have emerged as key points for the import,  distribution, manufacturing of illegal drugs.    ""Any money sent to California,"" said Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), ""is  part of the fight against the national drug problem.""    Other co-sponsors of the legislation are Democratic Reps.

0,FT932-14728 ,"FT932-14728 _AN-DDRATAAHFT 930417   FT  17 APR 93 / West warns Serbs as forces close in on Srebrenica: Britain, US and France pledge early strengthening of sanctions      By JUREK MARTIN, ROBERT MAUTHNER and LAURA SILBER      WASHINGTON, LONDON, BELGRADE   THE US, Britain and France last night agreed that stronger sanctions should be imposed against Serbia as soon as possible. The announcement from the British Foreign Office came amid growing fears that the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia was about to fall to surrounding Serb forces. The decision to push for tighter sanctions came shortly after President Bill Clinton said he believed the situation had now deteriorated to a point where Russia, the UK and France would have to consider options they had previously ruled out. The US did not specify what additional measures it would seek, though one unidentified Defence Department official was quoted as saying that bombing Bosnian Serb military installations was under consideration. In London, the Foreign Office said that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, had been in touch with his opposite numbers in Washington and Paris. 'In view of the deteriorating situation in Srebrenica and the seriousness of what the Serbs are doing, the three agreed to adopt a Security Council resolution bringing in more sanctions against the Serbs as soon as possible.' Members of the United Nations security council were last night discussing what measures might be taken and the timing of a full Security Council meeting to adopt them. Under consideration are likely to be measures to turn sanctions into a complete economic blockade. The resolution pending before the council would tighten sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro - which form the rump Yugoslavia - by strictly controlling traffic along the Danube and curbing transshipments through Serbia. It would also require UN members to impound Serbian vessels, freeze Serbian assets, and ban all commercial vessels from entering former Yugoslav territorial waters. Also last night the council was expected to pass a separate resolution proposed by non-aligned members declaring Srebrenica and surrounding areas a safe haven with provision for UN troops to monitor the situation. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, had already told Russian diplomats that, if the town fell, the US would not wait until after the Russian referendum on April 25 to seek more UN sanctions. Russia and Serbia have traditionally been allies, and Washington had originally promised the delay in order not to jeopardise the position of Mr Boris Yeltsin, who is seeking popular backing for his presidency. Serb forces yesterday advanced to within 1km of Srebrenica, the former silver-mining town which has come to symbolise Bosnian resistance against Serbia. But there was no confirmation of reports from Paris that Serb forces had entered the town. Last night Bosnian leaders broadcast desperate appeals to the outside world as terrorised civilians cowered in cellars to escape Serb artillery bombardments. An amateur radio operator in Srebrenica reported: 'I don't know how much longer we can resist . . . the offensive is unrelenting.' If Srebrenica surrendered, it would probably mean the end of other Moslem-held strongholds such as Gorazde and Zepa, to the south. Mr Kemal Muftic, an aide to Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, said talks were under way on the terms of surrender of the town. 'The most important thing is to avoid a massacre,' he said. About 50 UN lorries were on standby to evacuate tens of thousands of Moslems from the town, whose population has been swollen to an estimated 30,000-50,000 inhabitants by an influx of refugees. During the past week some 60 people have been reported killed by the Serb bombardment. The US warning on sanctions coincided with a statement by Mr Hurd calling for existing economic measures against Serbia to be tightened into a full blockade. He also proposed the appointment of 'a heavyweight international figure' to ensure the full compliance with and enforcement of sanctions. Contributing to the calls for action against the Serbs, Lord Owen, one of the international mediators for a peace settlement, said the time had come for the world to consider the selective bombing of roads and bridges in Bosnia, to stop supplies reaching the Bosnian Serb forces. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, backed his proposals. Mr Hurd said the British government was not ruling out air strikes 'but we would have to be clear how they would help'. Six RAF Tornado fighter aircraft will leave Britain on Monday to enforce the no-fly zone. Meanwhile Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, stressed that Serb units would not try to take Srebrenica if its Moslem defenders agreed to disarm but his words were not being taken seriously by the UN. A small party of Canadian UN soldiers was expected to cross Serb lines to Srebrenica last night, a move which fuelled fears that the town was about to fall. The UN Protection Force said the troops would try to 'avert a major humanitarian tragedy'.

Mr Omar Mustafa el-Montasser told a session of the General People's Congress that Libya was owed from abroad a total of Dollars 1.353bn (Pounds 900m) and FFr22bn (Pounds 2.47bn) , including interest on delayed payments. The minister said his government had asked the countries involved to reimburse cash. Those unable to do so would reimburse Libya in various ways from the assets of their companies in Libya, or through imports of goods and products from their countries, or by Libya taking stakes in their companies. The source of the minister's figures was not clear. It was not known whether he meant Libya would seize the assets of some foreign companies in Libya. Many foreign firms work in Libya's oil industry. His statement appeared to mark retaliation for UN sanctions imposed on Libya because of its refusal to hand over for trial two agents suspected of carrying out the bombing of a Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The sanctions were tightened in December to include a freeze of Libyan assets abroad and a ban on imports of certain oil equipment. Prime minister Abouzid Omar Dourdah said on Sunday that Libya had sharply cut its budget forecast for 1994 because of difficulties caused by the sanctions. 'The cut amounts to several billions (of dollars),' he said after a commission of the Congress had adopted the draft budget. 'As a result of the unjust UN sanctions, we have been forced to cut our expenses in several domains like education and health.'   Countries:-  LYZ  Libya, Africa.

The improvement came in spite of Dollars 41m of extraordinary catastrophe losses at its ITT Hartford insurance subsidiary, due to a severe winter storm and the February bombing of New York's World Trade Center, and a drop in after-tax portfolio gains at Hartford and ITT Financial to Dollars 42m from Dollars 84m. Net income totalled Dollars 175m, or Dollars 1.30 a share fully diluted, compared with net income of Dollars 138m, or Dollars 1, in the same period of last year, excluding accounting changes. Sales were static at Dollars 5.1bn. The figures were at the upper end of analysts' expectations and ITT shares rose Dollars 2 1/8 in morning trading on the New York stock exchange to stand at Dollars 80 3/4 . ITT Financial, which was the subject of a Dollars 612m fourth-quarter after-tax restructuring charge, reported income of Dollars 67m, up from Dollars 32m, due to lower loss provisions and borrowing costs. The automotive business saw income rise to Dollars 32m from Dollars 19m, following 'cost improvement actions,' while the Sheraton Hotels group transformed a Dollars 16m loss into Dollars 16m of profits, helped by 'higher occupancy and rates, particularly in the renovated New York city properties and significantly lower overhead expenses'. ITT Hartford reported income of Dollars 156m, down from Dollars 168m, though excluding portfolio gains and extraordinary losses the business had improved operating results.

The arrests were made last night at Balloch, Strathclyde,  near the Royal Navy base on the Clyde where Polaris and Trident  nuclear submarines are sited.    The Scottish skirmish was the latest in a series of clashes  between the convoys, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and  other peace protesters.    Trucks with police motorcycle outriders were briefly halted  earlier today by protesters at Albermarle, near Newcastle upon  Tyne, and then Stirling in Scotland.    Anti-nuclear campaigners claimed the convoy was one of those  which regularly took warheads between Burghfield, Berks, and the  Clyde submarine base.    Pat Freeborn said it was impeded near Balloch when  demonstrators chained themselves to vehicles and daubed them  with paint in protest at warheads being carried on public roads.    ""If they are going to have such dangerous weapons, there  must  be another method of moving them,"" he said. ""They are going to  end up blowing up the very people they are supposed to be  protecting.""    The Ministry of Defence said there were ""incidents"" today  involving a military convoy, but described them as minor and  would not confirm the presence of nuclear warhead carriers.    Police said 15 men and seven women were arrested over an  alleged breach of the peace but could not say if they would  appear in court.     "

He demanded that the suspect be handed over to the German  authorities.    A German court issued a warrant for the arrest of suspect  Yusuf S. [not further identified] in 1990 for participating in  the attack. The spokesman added that the German court also  accuses him of planning the attack.    On 5 April 1986, a bomb blast at a nightclub frequented by  U.S. military personnel in Berlin killed three people and  wounded 230 others. The United States accused Libya of being  behind the attack and retaliated by bombing Tripoli 10 days  later.    Lebanese judiciary sources said the man being detained in  Lebanon, who is of Palestinian origin, worked in the Jamahiriyah  office in East Berlin. The spokesman added that the man was  arrested in Lebanon in 1992 and has been in custody since. The  spokesman could not say whether he was arrested for the charges  against him or for other reasons.    The spokesman added: ""Since then, we have been trying to get  him handed over to Germany to try him."" He added: ""The German  Embassy received his file in August 1993.""    The German authorities were informed of the arrest of Yusuf  S. in Lebanon at the end of 1992 but the information was not  revealed so as to keep the investigation secret.    Another Palestinian, 'Imad Mahmud (37), has been held in  Berlin since November 1992 on charges of planning and  participating in the attack on the nightclub.     "

An undeclared but interested candidate, he seemed to suffer a setback when Finland's Martti Ahtisaari, a senior UN official with similar aspirations, was named to conduct an on-the-spot assessment of the war's effects on civilians in Iraq and Kuwait. Prince Sadruddin, already in charge of UN humanitarian aid, resigned in a huff. Ahtisaari's emotive report, speaking of the 'near-apocalyptic' results of allied bombing reducing a formerly prosperous Iraq to the 'pre-industrial age', did not go down well in Washington and London. President Bush is said to have proposed personally to current secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar that the 58-year-old French-born prince be restored at the first opportunity. A former UN high commissioner for refugees, he has now been entitled executive delegate. That means he will in effect be the secretary-general's deputy, standing in for him at all inter-agency meetings on the Gulf. He has at least 35 rivals to replace Perez de Cuellar when his term expires at the year-end, including representatives of African states who believe it is their turn. But as the veto-holding US and UK have emphasised that the top UN job is not subject to the rule of equitable geographic distribution, prospects of an African secretary-general seem slight.

By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      In a sequel to its highly touted ""Operation Blue Rag,"" in which 77 Crip gang  members were arrested for drug sales, law enforcement officials rounded up 96  more Crip and Blood gang members during ""Operation Red Rag"" in East and  Southeast San Diego over the past three days.    The five-month ""Red Rag"" operation, so named to target the Piru, or Blood, gang  members, who favor red handkerchiefs, mirrored ""Blue Rag,"" a nine-month  investigation that involved the West Coast Crips, who have adopted blue as  their color.    The 96 arrested in ""Red Rag"" is the single largest sweep of gang members in San  Diego's history, officials said, and will be repeated.    As in its initial operation, which ended last March, the San Diego Police  Department used a former gang member as a confidential informant armed with  money seized in previous drug raids to make dozens of drug buys, including rock  cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine, over five months.    The investigations differed in two ways. While ""Blue Rag"" included an informant  wired for sound, ""Red Rag"" included audiotaped and videotaped locations where  the informant would lure gang members before making buys. Dist. Atty. Edwin  Miller said the tapes will help make convictions easier when the cases get to  trial, probably before Christmas.    The second difference, investigators said, was the ease with which the ""Red  Rag"" informant was able to make buys from both Crip and Blood gang members.  Police had targeted the Bloods, but found that their informant was able to move  easily through Crips gang areas.    Of the 77 arrested during ""Blue Rag,"" half are out of jail after serving six  months or less. With 96 more arrested, the two operations had an impact on more  than 4% of the 3,900 gang members registered with the police gang unit.    The relatively small percentage, law enforcement officials said, is significant  because the gang members targeted were among the most violent, most prone to  get involved in drive-by shootings, and the most heavily involved in dealing  drugs.    ""The percentage of people we took out is not as important as who we took out,""  said police Sgt. Ross Stone, who led the department's investigation.    The operation also included help from the district attorney's office, the state  Justice Department's Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement, the federal Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. Attorney General's Office and the  county's probation department. ""We may have 3,900 gang members out there, but  many of them are not as hard-core as others,"" he said.

Police Chief Bob Burgreen said the ""Blue Rag"" operation ""kicked a hole, a big  hole into the Crips"" of San Diego. ""They are not back to where they were  before, and it will take months and months for them to recover and get back  into place.""    Although 96 were arrested over the past three days, 112 gang members,  representing 13 gangs, were charged. The rest were being sought Thursday.    All but 12 were local gang members -- representing groups with names like the  ""Eastside Piru"" and ""Upside Sic."" The rest were from Los Angeles gangs, like  the ""Raymond Avenue Crips"" and the ""L.A. Pueblo Bishop Crips.""

But, with the June passage of Proposition 115, which did away  with lengthy preliminary hearings following grand jury indictments, prosecutors  can charge and bring defendants to trial more quickly. The absence of  preliminary hearings also keeps confidential informants from having to testify  until trial.    The arrests began at about 6 a.m. Tuesday, when more than 100 officers  representing six state and federal agencies began making arrests in East San  Diego, Emerald Hills, Logan Heights, Lincoln Park, near Skyline Drive, near  John F.

Amin Salamah, father of Mohammad Salamah (26), who, along  with three others, was found guilty by a jury in a New York  court Friday [4 March], is also bitter that no Jordanian  organisation or individual stepped forward to help him or advise  him.    He said he had obtained a three-month-valid U.S. visa in  September, but did not have enough money to buy a ticket to New  York to visit his son and see whether there was anything he  could do to help establish his innocence.    Mr. Salamah, a retired army lieutenant who hails from Bedia  village in the West Bank, works for Amman Customs Clearing  Agency to provide for his family of 11 children younger to  Mohammad and their mother with his Army pension and a JD 120  monthly salary.    ""I did not leave a single known door unknocked,"" he told the  JORDAN TIMES. ""But there was nobody who was willing to help,  including those who call themselves human rights activists and  experts in law.""    ""They had no interest in the case, and many appeared anxious  not to have anything to do with it,"" he said.    ""My question to them is: ""Isn't every accused entitled to a  fair trial? And if so, was my son given a fair trial? Did any  Jordanian lawyer take the slightest interest to find out whether  the trial followed the due process of the law?""    Mr. Salamah, 51, who fled his village along with his family  in the 1967 war, believes that neither his son nor any of the  other three is guilty, and that Israeli agents seeking to  distort the image of Arabs and Muslims had a hand in the affair  and entrapped the accused in the case.    ""My instinct and conscience tells me there is much more to  the entire affair than we have been told,"" he said, adding that  the summation of his son's lawyer, Richard Precht, was the most  damaging element that led to the guilty verdict.    ""Throughout the trial, the lawyer was very good and made a  very good case of Mohammad's defence. But, for some unknown  reasons, he took a complete turn in the last minute,"" said Mr.  Salameh, who lives in Zarqa.    ""Perhaps he was coerced, pressured or forced into doing  that,"" he said. ""But it does not change the fact that my son  and three others now face life in prison.""    He was referring to Mr. Precht's closing argument that  Mohammad Salamah was an unwitting victim of another defendant  who trapped him into taking part in the Feb. 26 explosion at the  twin-towers. The blast killed six people and injured more than  1,000.    Describing Ramzi Yusuf, an accused who remains at large, as  an ""evil genuis,"" Mr. Precht asserted that Mohammad Salamah was  duped by Mr. Yusuf. ""Mohammad Salamah was terribly misled,  terribly manipulated... by a person who came into this country  with a single mission, to destroy American targets,"" Mr. Precht  told the court on Feb. 17.    Mr. Precht was the only defence lawer who presented such an  argument which implied that there was a bomb plot and Mr.  Salamah was part of it. All others maintained the total  innocence of their clinets and at least one of them accused Mr.  Precht of undermining his client's defence.    Mr. Salamah said his son contacted him over the phone on  Thursday, less than 24 hours before the verdict was announced.    ""He sounded very confident that all would be acquitted,"" Mr.  Salamah said. ""He told me he would be with us here in a few  days.""    ""Even the lawyer, who had called me a few days earlier, told  me the same thing. He said the charges were unfounded and  unsubstantiated,"" said Mr. Salamah.    The ex-serviceman noted that Mohammad had filed a petition  to  the judge that Mr. Precht's incriminatory summation did not  represent his views and that the lawyer was no longer his legal  counsel.    ""But the court decided to accept the lawyer's argument that  there was no change in his status as Mohammad's counsel,"" Mr.  Salamah said.    ""I don't know why (Precht) did such an injustice to my son,  who always maintained his innocence and never told the lawyer  anything of the nature that was presented to the court,"" said  Amin Salamah.    ""My limited knowledge of things tells me a lawyer is not  supposed to invent things and present them in court on behalf of  his client,"" he said. ""Where did he get the notion that  Mohammad had any part, witting or otherwise, in the attack?""    Mr. Salamah said his son, who has been in touch with the  family over the phone from his prison, ""always swore by God and  assured me that he had nothing to do with the bombing and that  he was never involved in any subversive plots.    ""I brought up and educated my son, and I believe him.""     "

A third man among those arrested at the airport was  originally suspected of being a ""coyote,"" or smuggler, but evidence against him  is ""thin,"" according to the spokesman.    He said it was not known if Fernandez-Martinez and Lomeli-Perez were working  together.      Arraignment Tuesday    Information obtained so far suggests that these arrests are ""unrelated"" to the  arrest last week of Jorge Guzman-Romero, who was also charged with smuggling,  Brechtel said.    He said INS officials will seek to have the illegal aliens declared material  witnesses against the suspected smugglers, who are scheduled to be arraigned  Tuesday.    Immigration officials announced Friday that their investigation has expanded to  include surveillance of several ""drop houses,"" which reportedly are becoming  increasingly crowded as immigrants wait for the smugglers to arrange alternate  modes of transportation.

0,FT922-10338 ,"FT922-10338 _AN-CEAA3ADRFT 920501   FT  01 MAY 92 / LA hit by further violent outbreaks      By GEORGE GRAHAM and BILL GIRDNER      WASHINGTON, LOS ANGELES   SPORADIC shootings, looting and arson continued in Los Angeles last night, as armoured cars and National Guard troops were out in force after overnight violence had left at least 10 dead and 400 injured. Blacks continued to react in disbelief to the acquittal of four white police officers charged with assaulting a black motorist, Mr Rodney King. The acquittal had come in spite of the evidence of widely-screened amateur videotape of the beating. Mayor Tom Bradley announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the city, and curbed the sale of guns, ammunition and petrol, in an effort to stem rioting. The Insurance Information Institute said at least Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.4m) of damage had already been caused. It was the worst spate of violence to hit Los Angeles since the Watts riots of 1965. Yesterday police reported they had made more than 250 arrests as rioters continued to ransack stores and set dozens of new fires. 'It is not under control. There are looters, sporadic incidents of violence and a lot of pushing and shoving going on,' said Mr Bill Frio, a police department spokesman. Captain Steve Ruda of the fire department said he did not have the manpower to put out all the fires across the 30-square-mile area hit by rioting. Anger over the verdict spread to black communities across the country yesterday, sparking fears that the Los Angeles riots might be copied in other cities. 'There is a danger that the crisis in Los Angeles will spread across the country,' said Mr Jesse Jackson, the black political leader. Demonstrations in cities such as Cleveland, Dallas and New York were peaceful, for the most part. But in Atlanta, police made numerous arrests when a rally got out of control. Looting was also reported in San Jose, near San Francisco. In Los Angeles, Mr Jeff Cramer, a freelance reporter for the Boston Globe, was shot five times, but was in a stable condition last night. He said a crowd had tried to take him out of his car but had failed to undo his seat belt. Gunshot victims were wheeled into a hospital about a mile south of the city centre regularly through the night. Seeing flames a block away, a black security guard said: 'Burn baby burn]' President George Bush said the Justice Department would accelerate its investigation of the King case. They would examine whether to bring federal charges of violating Mr King's civil rights against the police officers after their acquittal on assault charges under California state law. Appealing for calm, he said the verdict had 'left us all with a deep sense of personal frustration and anguish', but condemned the 'murder and violence in the streets of Los Angeles'. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Mr Bush's likely Democratic opponent in this year's presidential election, said he was astonished by the verdict, and hoped for a stronger statement from the president. In the 1960s, federal prosecutors began to use charges of civil rights violations because of the difficulty of persuading many all-white state juries in the segregated Deep South to convict whites of crimes whose victims were black. In spite of improvements since then, many blacks still feel that the legal system is heavily biased against them, a feeling reinforced by Wednesday's verdict. 'It may be that 12 white jurors aren't going to convict four white cops for beating a black man, and maybe that's as basic as it is,' said Mr Steve Lerman, Mr King's lawyer. Some black leaders criticised judges for transferring the trial to a courtroom in predominantly white Ventura County, next to Los Angeles. The videotape of the beating was thought to have prejudiced the chances of a fair trial in the city itself. Attorney-general William Barr said yesterday that 123 police officers had been charged by the Justice Department in the last 3 1/2 years with civil rights violations for brutality. Although these federal cases are also tried by juries, the conviction rate was around 75 per cent. A resident of the neighbourhood reacted in bitterness to the assault. 'It's destroying the family. The neighbourhood family has been wiped out. It breaks your heart,' said Mrs Delores Hill, a local resident.

0,FT933-8092 ,"FT933-8092 _AN-DHRCGABBFT 930818   FT  18 AUG 93 / US may brand Sudan as terrorist state      By REUTER      WASHINGTON   MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is preparing to place Sudan on the US list of states accused of sponsoring terrorism, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. An announcement could come as soon as today, they said. The US has been increasingly concerned about Sudan's ties to Iran and radical groups and this is to be the basis of Mr Christopher's decision, the officials said. But the determination also comes after an ABC Television report on Monday that US intelligence officials believe top government officials of Sudan were involved in a plot earlier this year to blow up the United Nations, FBI headquarters and two tunnels in New York. Citing intelligence sources, ABC television news said federal agents, after monitoring Sudan's mission to the UN for two months and from other evidence, felt the government of Sudan was involved in the alleged plot last June. The ABC report named two Sudanese intelligence officers as the link between Sudan and the alleged plot. The report said US officials believed the men helped five other Sudanese residents of the US who were indicted in the bombing conspiracy. There is no evidence that Sudan's ambassador to the UN, Mr Ahmed Suliman, was involved, the ABC report said. Mr Suliman in June denied that the mission had anything to do with the planned bombings in New York, and said that terrorism was 'alien' to his country. Mr Christopher was 'expected to make an announcement about his decision within a matter of days,' a State Department official said. Another official said Mr Christopher was 'preparing to conduct the necessary notification of foreign governments and members of Congress' that Sudan has been placed on the terrorism list.

Therefore, it was difficult to prevent the incident.  However, more preventive measures are now required for  important places, while cooperation is being undertaken with  various countries in preventing serious incidents, and good  relations are to be maintained with Middle East countries.    Talking about safeguarding peace and order in the country,  Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of the National  Security Council, said that if everyone helps government  authorities keep a close watch on the matter, he believed the  acts marring public peace and order can be prevented. Besides,  everyone is urged to have confidence in the ability of  intelligence officials in carrying out their duties, because  they have always been working attentively and trying to find  ways to prevent mishaps. Additional preventive measures have  also been implemented.    As for the development of the investigation into the case of  international terrorist operations, Police General Prathin  Santipraphop, director general of the Police Department, said  that the arrest of the culprits seems unlikely because it is  believed they have already left the country. However,  cooperation has been sought with other countries that are  expected to have a criminal background on the group of  terrorists so that further police action can be taken to arrest  them.    Meanwhile, the interior minister has called a meeting of  officials concerned to follow up the case and find guidelines to  prevent such incidents.     "
0,FT924-11339 ,"FT924-11339 _AN-CJ1BTAG7FT 921027   FT  27 OCT 92 / Kidnap gangs hold Philippines economy to ransom: Manila's campaign to attract new foreign investors is being undermined by a law and order crisis      By JOSE GALANG   PHILIPPINE officials are finding out that improving the country's economy and taming the political opposition are not enough in attracting more foreign investment. Efforts are being stymied by a rash of kidnap-for-ransom incidents involving rich businessmen and their relatives. Most of the victims have been Manila-based businessmen of Chinese descent, along with a number of Americans and Japanese, and other expatriates in Mindanao in the southern Philippines. Worried Chinese-Filipino traders have taken defensive measures, and some families are packing up and taking their assets elsewhere. If security for businessmen is not improved and the kidnapping gangs dismantled, the effect could be disastrous. The increasing lawlessness, according to analysts, could be disastrous for the government's campaign to woo new investments, deemed essential in perking up an economy that in the first half of this year was stagnant. The Philippines had failed to cash in on the surge in foreign investment flows into South-East Asia in the late 1980s, owing to the repeated coup attempts at the time that portrayed instability in the country. Missing the boat again could permanently cripple Manila's attempt to catch up with its fast-growing neighbours. After the peaceful elections and orderly transfer of power some five months ago, there has been a steady stream of trade and investment missions visiting Manila, including Chinese companies based in Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. However, the investors' safety has persistently surfaced as a serious concern. The government of Mr Fidel Ramos, who on October 8 completed his first 100 days in office as president, is aiming for an annual average of Dollars 2.5bn of investment over the six years to 1998, during which it hopes to record average economic growth of 8 per cent a year. At one local business presentation recently conducted by Mr Rizalino Navarro, the trade and industry secretary, the audience of foreign diplomats based in Manila asked mainly about specific government measures that would ensure the safety of investors. In the first eight months of this year, a total of 29 kidnappings were reported to the police, most of them ending with the victims' families paying up millions of pesos to the kidnap syndicates. No arrests have been reported and the cases have remained unsolved. The number of cases reported was double that in the same period three years ago, according to an official report. Among the latest unreported cases, according to a group of Chinese-Filipino professionals, were the kidnappings of 22 of their group over August-September alone, and which reportedly involved pay-offs of some 50m pesos (Dollars 2.1m) to the kidnap gangs. Early this year, the Senate defence committee reported that in 1991 there were about 50 kidnap-for-ransom cases, most of which had been unreported owing to the victims' fears of further harm. The kidnappers 'earned' a total of up to 300m pesos (Dollars 12.5m) in these activities, the report said. Some of the payments were reportedly made abroad. A serious stumbling block towards solving the problem is the suspected involvement of police and military officers in the 'lucrative' kidnappings. On the other hand, the newly organised Presidential Anti-Crime Commission (PACC), supposedly a 'super-body' against lawlessness and headed by Mr Joseph Estrada, the vice-president, had been hamstrung by inadequate financing and alleged 'leaks' in its operations. Mr Estrada was thought to have gained an important breakthrough last month with the arrest of two senior police officers, one directly in charge of anti-kidnapping operations. A third police officer had admitted to Mr Estrada his involvement in kidnappings allegedly planned by the senior officers, and has turned state witness in the court cases against the two. The PACC has also made some arrests in recent weeks of alleged kidnap gang members. However, the arrests represent a small proportion of a reported total of some 40 kidnap gangs operating in metropolitan Manila alone. Confidence in the government's drive has also been tarnished by the recent 'confession' by an arrested gang leader of the alleged involvement of some '10 generals in the police and military in his group's activities'. This was hastily retracted. The police involved with the kidnappers reportedly have connections in the local Chinese community, along with suspected members of Chinese organised crime syndicates operating in Hong Kong and Taiwan. It is alleged they identify prospective targets for kidnapping operations. Successful entrepreneurs active in the community as leaders are also coming under suspicion. The kidnapping syndicates are so sophisticated that some ransom notes are said to be accompanied by photocopies of the victim's bank statements. Yesterday police released a list of the 12 'most-wanted criminals' which included a number of alleged kidnap gang leaders. On the list were Chinese-Filipinos said to be the kidnap syndicates' connections in the Chinese community. Big rewards were offered for their arrest. The PACC's image was badly tarnished when a gang in late August kidnapped a Manila businessman's son, a godson of Mr Estrada. The family refused to co-operate with the police for fear of jeopardising the boy's safety and after several days paid a reported 25m pesos (Dollars 1.04m). Last month two teenage sons of Chinese-Filipino merchants were killed even after the payment of a ransom of 1.7m pesos. These incidents have caused anger and outrage in the Chinese-Filipino community. However, government officials apparently have succeeded in talking leaders of ethnic Chinese businessmen out of plans to set up vigilante forces manned by foreign mercenaries. Mr Ramos may also have contributed to the anxiety by declaring that he was 'not satisfied' with the performance of the PACC, which prompted an offer by Mr Estrada to resign. Mr Ramos quickly reiterated full confidence in his anti-crime leader and ordered immediate financing for the PACC, including protection for witnesses. Mr Ramos, a former general who headed the Philippine Constabulary has also declared an 'all-out war' against the kidnap syndicates. The outcome of that war will go a long way to determining the shape of the country's economy in the coming years.  The Financial Times   International Page 6  "
0,FT932-12348 ,"FT932-12348 _AN-DD2CUAARFT 930429   FT  29 APR 93 / Andreotti signs up Bush adviser      By ALAN FRIEDMAN      NEW YORK   A FORMER senior official of the Bush administration is being hired as legal counsel in the US by Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former Christian Democrat prime minister of Italy who is being investigated for alleged collusion with the Sicilian Mafia. Mr Abraham Sofaer, who was the state department's legal adviser between 1985 and 1990, said yesterday he had spoken to Mr Andreotti this week and was in the process of being retained. The hiring of Mr Sofaer, a high-profile lawyer whose last job was as legal adviser to Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, confirms Mr Andreotti's pledge to contest the Mafia-related charges vigorously. Mr Sofaer, who helped to form the US government's legal position for its 1986 bombing raid against Libya under the Reagan administration, said he had gained familiarity with Mafia issues as a federal court judge in New York City between 1979 and 1985. The hiring follows a vote on Tuesday by an Italian Senate commission to waive the 74-year-old Mr Andreotti's parliamentary immunity. The waiver must be confirmed by a secret ballot vote by the full Senate. Mr Sofaer, a managing partner in Washington at the law firm of Hughes, Hubbard and Reed, said that among his first efforts would be to try 'to explain to the western press the way the precise issues before the Italian Senate are not being properly depicted'. He said Mr Andreotti was not opposed to being investigated, but was opposed to an investigation by magistrates in Palermo 'whom Mr Andreotti believes are biased against him'. A number of the charges against Mr Andreotti are based on testimony provided by former Mafia members who are now co-operating with the Italian authorities.

Airport Police equipped with  High Technology""; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Bern 15 Feb (ATS) -- After the 1969 Palestinian  bombing, the police force at Zurich-Kloten airport has undergone  quite some changes. Insignificant until then, it has turned  into an 800-strong security force outfitted with  state-of-the-art equipment. Two new projects will be carried  out in the near future, namely the upgrading of the airport's  enclosure and cargo installation.    Immediately after the bombing of the Israeli aircraft, a  decision was made to separately control planes coming from and  going to the Middle East. These are under permanent  surveillance, airport police chief Ulrich Neeracher told ATS  [Agence Telegraphique Suisse]. Mail is now controlled using  X-ray devices. From the Fall of 1969, Swiss Army troops began  guarding the airport; they remained in place for a year before  being relieved by the Zurich canton police.    After a bomb explosion in the luggage compartment of a  Swissair aircraft in February 1970, leading to its crash in  Wuerenlingen, luggage control was introduced, as well as  controls of Israel-bound freight. Since the hijacking of a  Swissair plane to Jordan in Fall 1970, specially trained  security agents accompany long-distance flights.    Maximum Emergency    Today, Zurich-Kloten's airport police uses state-of-the-art  monitoring techniques: bomb detectors, or bicolor X-ray  machines. Security measures are reinforced depending on the  needs. The last maximum security alert was installed during the  Gulf War, in early 1991.    In 1990, policemen managed to avert an attack against an  Israeli El-Al plane, when they discovered a bomb inside a  suitcase.     "

It is not a secret that parliament's crisis on  May 18 was intendedly provoked by the authorities. They knew  that the irritated opposition would leave Parliament's session  and would prefer to conduct a rally. Dispersion of the  demonstrators, arrests and slaughter of the deputies and party  leaders on May 21 just poured oil in the flame.    Yesterday the police seized and beat the deputy and the PFA  leader, Ibragim Ibragimli. On the same day the Milli Majlis  made a request to President Aliyev to reduce the quorum in the  Majlis from 34 to 26 voices. The approval of this request by  President Aliyev means that any his proposals will be  immediately adopted by legislative body of the country.    The opposition is put in the following conditions: Either it  will capitulate and resign itself to dictatorship or it will put  resistance.    The authorities commit outrages and realizing the danger of  it, they try to make their activities legal.    The conflict between the opposition and the authorities  takes  place on the background of worsened geopolitical situation and  due to this fact foreign forces urge Azerbaijan on confrontation  with elements of civil war. Probably, the foreign forces intend  to remove the current president. However, he will not leave his  office easily and the situation can lose control. One should  take into account that Azerbaijan is at the state of war and  civil confrontation in the Republic can cause serious  consequences.     "

This forum clearly and loudly asked President Djohar  to step down and today we want to sensitize the entire Comoran  community to that fact. All the people invited to this rally  agreed to come in great numbers in order to demand the  resignation of the head of state, to fight for the respect of  the principle of human rights and democratic liberties as well  as the establishment of a genuine law-abiding state.    President Djohar along with his son-in-law, (Mshangama),  will  miss no occasion to violate the principles of the Constitution.  Moreover, President Djohar's son-in-law, (Mshangama), maneuvered  to be elected and undertook a true coup de force to be elected  speaker of the National Assembly. Right at this moment, many  opponents are imprisoned and this is the case of a  parliamentarian who was regularly elected in the first round of  the legislative elections at (Moutamoudou), namely Mr. Ahmed  Mohamed. We believe that this wave of arrests is a serious  breach of human rights principles and one of the main grievances  of the opposition today is the demand for the immediate and  unconditional release of all political prisoners.

Vivekanand]    [Text] The devastated father of a Jordanian convicted in  the New York World Trade Centre bombing is agonising over why  his son's lawyer did a volte-face in his summation, which he  believes led to the conviction of not only his son but also  another three defendants.    Amin Salamah, father of Mohammad Salamah (26), who, along  with three others, was found guilty by a jury in a New York  court Friday, is also bitter that no Jordanian organisation or  individual stepped forward to help him or advise him.    He said he had obtained a three-month-valid U.S. visa in  September, but did not have enough money to buy a ticket to New  York to visit his son and see whether there was anything he  could do to help establish his innocence.    Mr. Salamah, a retired army lieutenant who hails from Bedia  village in the West Bank, works for Amman Customs Clearning  Agency to provide for his family of 11 children younger to  Mohammad and their mother with his Army pension and a JD 120  monthly salary.    ""I did not leave a single known door unknocked,"" he told the  JORDAN TIMES. ""But there was nobody who was willing to help,  including those who call themselves human rights activists and  experts in law.""    ""They had no interest in the case, and many appeared anxious  not to have anything to do with it,"" he said.    My question to them is: ""Isn't every accused entitled to a  fair trial? And if so, was my son given a fair trial? Did any  Jordanian lawyer take the slightest interest to find out whether  the trial followed the due process of the law?""    Mr. Salamah, 51, who fled his village along with his family  in the 1967 war, believes that neither his son nor any of the  other three is guilty, and that Israeli agents seeking to  distort the image of Arabs and Muslims had a hand in the affair  and entrapped the accused in the case.    ""My instinct and conscience tells me there is much more to  the entire affair than we have been told,"" he said, adding that  the summation of his son's lawyer, Richard Precht, was the most  damaging element that led to the guilty verdict.    ""Throughout the trial, the lawyer was very good and made a  very good case of Mohammad's defence. But, for some unknown  reasons, he took a complete turn in the last minute,"" said Mr.  Salameh, who lives in Zarqa.    ""Perhaps he was coerced, pressured or forced into doing  that,"" he said. ""But it does not change the fact that my son  and three others now face life in prison.""    He was referring to Mr. Precht's closing argument that  Mohammad Salamah was an unwitting victim of another defendant  who trapped him into taking part in the Feb. 26 explosion at the  twin-towers. The blast killed six people and injured more than  1,000.    Describing Ramzi Yusuf, an accused who remains at large, as  an ""evil genuis,"" Mr. Precht asserted that Mohammad Salamah was  duped by Mr. Yusuf. ""Mohammad Salamah was terribly misled,  terribly manipulated... by a person who came into this country  with a single mission, to destroy American targets,"" Mr. Precht  told the court on Feb. 17.    Mr. Precht was the only defence lawer who presented such an  argument which implied that there was a bomb plot and Mr.  Salamah was part of it. All others maintained the total  innocence of their clinets and at least one of them accused Mr.  Precht of undermining his client's defence.    Mr. Salamah said his son contacted him over the phone on  Thursday, less than 24 hours before the verdict was announced.    ""He sounded very confident that all would be acquitted,"" Mr.  Salamah said. ""He told me he would be with us here in a few  days.""    ""Even the lawyer, who had called me a few days earlier, told  me the same thing. He said the charges were unfounded and  unsubstantiated,"" said Mr. Salamah.    The ex-serviceman noted that Mohammad had filed a petition  to  the judge that Mr. Precht's incriminatory summation did not  represent his views and that the lawyer was no longer his legal  counsel.    ""But the court decided to accept the lawyer's argument that  there was no change in his status as Mohammad's counsel,"" Mr.  Salamah said.    ""I don't know why (Precht) did such an injustice to my son,  who always maintained his innocence and never told the lawyer  anything of the nature that was presented to the court,"" said  Amin Salamah.    ""My limited knowledge of things tells me a lawyer is not  supposed to invent things and present them in court on behalf of  his client,"" he said. ""Where did he get the notion that  Mohammad had any part, witting or otherwise, in the attack?""    Mr. Salamah said his son, who has been in touch with the  family over the phone from his prison, ""always swore by God and  assured me that he had nothing to do with the bombing and that  he was never involved in any subversive plots.""    ""I brought up and educated my son, and I believe him.""     "

By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Surrounded by more than 100 guns confiscated over the holiday weekend, Los  Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates on Tuesday credited threats of felony  prosecution and a campaign urging citizens to report neighbors seen shooting  skyward with a dramatic reduction in random gunfire on New Year's Eve.    At a news conference, Gates said police arrested 66 people and seized 124 guns  of all descriptions ""capable of snuffing out someone's life whether you shoot  directly at them or into the air.""    ""Because of a lot of work of Neighborhood Watch programs and good citizens, and  very fine police work,"" the chief said, ""we have reduced what has been a very,  very serious problem -- not to the extent we want to reduce it, but to a point  where we feel we have had some success and an impact.""    While arrests were higher than ever, the number of reports of shots fired in  the city was down 43% from last year, Gates said.    ""We usually get about 1,300 calls,"" he said. ""This year, we logged 706, which  is an amazing difference.""    Felony charges are being filed against the 66 people, many of whose arrests  were based on information supplied by their neighbors -- a fact that may  present problems for county prosecutors needing witnesses to win a conviction,  Gates acknowledged.    ""These cases are difficult to prosecute without witnesses,"" the chief said.  ""But we are not going to pit neighbor against neighbor; that won't work. If we  get into a situation where we are doing just that, we will probably drop the  charges.""    Gates added, however, that ""most citizens who complained, believe me . . . said  they care, said they are tired of this and said they are willing to testify.""    ""You have to have a witness to get a conviction,"" said Sandi Gibbons,  spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. ""Fortunately, in the majority  of the . . . felony cases we filed Tuesday, our witnesses are officers who saw  the defendants fire the weapons into the air.""    Still, the fact that citizens often alerted police to the shootings in the  first place bothered residents in some parts of the city.    For example, South Los Angeles resident Pat O'Neal, whose 19-year-old son was  arrested Monday morning by police with search warrants, said she believes that  the person who identified her son as a shooter may have had a grudge against  her family, which owns and rents several houses on her street.

By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Surrounded by more than 100 guns confiscated over the holiday weekend, Los  Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates on Tuesday credited threats of felony  prosecution and a campaign urging citizens to report neighbors seen shooting  skyward with a dramatic reduction in random gunfire on New Year's Eve.    At a news conference, Gates said police arrested 66 people and seized 124 guns  of all descriptions ""capable of snuffing out someone's life whether you shoot  directly at them or into the air.""    ""Because of a lot of work of Neighborhood Watch programs and good citizens, and  very fine police work,"" the chief said, ""we have reduced what has been a very,  very serious problem -- not to the extent we want to reduce it, but to a point  where we feel we have had some success and an impact.""    While arrests were higher than ever, the number of reports of shots fired in  the city was down 43% from last year, Gates said.    ""We usually get about 1,300 calls,"" he said. ""This year, we logged 706, which  is an amazing difference.""    Felony charges are being filed against the 66 people, many of whose arrests  were based on information supplied by their neighbors -- a fact that may  present problems for county prosecutors needing witnesses to win a conviction,  Gates acknowledged.    ""These cases are difficult to prosecute without witnesses,"" the chief said.  ""But we are not going to pit neighbor against neighbor; that won't work. If we  get into a situation where we are doing just that, we will probably drop the  charges.""    Gates added, however, that ""most citizens who complained, believe me . . . said  they care, said they are tired of this and said they are willing to testify.""    ""You have to have a witness to get a conviction,"" said Sandi Gibbons,  spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. ""Fortunately, in the majority  of the . . . felony cases we filed Tuesday, our witnesses are officers who saw  the defendants fire the weapons into the air.""    Still, the fact that citizens often alerted police to the shootings in the  first place bothered residents in some parts of the city.    For example, South Los Angeles resident Pat O'Neal, whose 19-year-old son was  arrested Monday morning by police with search warrants, said she believes that  the person who identified her son as a shooter may have had a grudge against  her family, which owns and rents several houses on her street.    ""I'm going to tell police I don't know who called and set my son up like this,""  O'Neal said. ""But I resent them coming over here and taking him out like he was  a convict, and I resent my home being invaded by police.""    April Netterville, 21, who lives across the street from O'Neal, said police  used search warrants to raid her home Monday morning.    ""They broke my bed,"" Netterville said. ""They didn't find anything. They didn't  arrest anyone.""    Beyond the problem of pitting neighbor against neighbor, Lt. Bruce Hagerty  suggested additional problems in prosecuting the cases.

SERRANO, Times Staff Writer      Eighty-two people were arrested Saturday when hundreds of anti-abortion  protesters struck two area women's clinics.    The 82 were arrested after refusing to leave a San Diego complex until they  were forced to do so by police using pain-compliance techniques. There were no  arrests at a La Mesa clinic, where protesters voluntarily left after  barricading nurses and patients inside.    The demonstrations led by Operation Rescue organizers began shortly after dawn  and marked the first time in the recent series of sit-down protests in San  Diego County that two women's clinics were targeted at the same time.    Protesters at the San Diego offices of Dr. Phillip Rand and Dr. Gilbert S.  Hardie sat before the front and rear doors, refusing to leave despite police  warnings that they were violating a federal court order prohibiting such  behavior.      Forced Into Police Vans    About an hour into the protest, police officers wielding nunchakus applied pain  to the wrists of about two-thirds of the demonstrators and physically forced  them into police vans. Three protesters slid under a police van, but officers  forced them out and arrested them.    The nunchakus, as they have in the past, created the greatest concern among the  demonstrators.    The Citizens' Advisory Board on Police/Community Relations is reviewing the use  of the controversial pain-compliance devices, and several board officials were  on hand to observe the demonstrations and arrests Saturday morning.    They saw dozens of protesters rising to    their feet with the nunchakus wrapped tightly around their wrists and heard  many of their cries and moans throughout the morning.    ""I don't know,"" said Andrea Skorepa, chairwoman of the review panel. ""It looks  like they (the demonstrators) have a fairly peaceful attitude.""    But she was inclined to disagree with protesters' demands that the officers  pick them up and carry them out.    ""I don't think that's a viable solution. There's more of a chance of injury,  for the officers and the demonstrators.""    Two of the demonstrators who voluntarily walked into the police vans said they  suffered severe injuries from past protests.    Dr. Michael Forrester of Fallbrook said a bone in his right wrist had been  broken. ""They just snapped it. I could hear it. I felt the crunch, and a guy  three feet away heard it snap, too.""    Nancy Scofield, a nurse from Poway, said both her arms and shoulders have been  injured with sprains and severe nerve damage. One arm was in a sling; the other  wrapped in a bandage.    ""It was unnecessary brutal force,"" she said. ""I can't work. My family cooks. My  daughter cleans the house. I can barely lift up a cup of coffee.""    Rep. Duncan Hunter, (R-Coronado), said in a telephone interview that pain  should not be inflicted on peaceful demonstrators.    ""It's not for the police to punish people because they plan or orchestrate a  demonstration,"" he said.    But Police Chief Bob Burgreen, in a letter to Hunter, strongly defended the use  of nunchakus.    ""Pain-compliance techniques are neither bizarre nor cruel and rarely result in  injury,"" he said.    Rand and Hardie could not be seen at the Mission Village clinic during the  protest. But two employees did arrive for work, and they became visibly upset  when demonstrators noted that they were pregnant and began urging them against  an abortion. However, the employees never indicated they ever even considered  an abortion.    And Billi Wheeler, a nurse at the clinic, said abortions aren't even performed  there.

Relatives of the patients waited outside, concerned for their safety.    ""It's crazy, it's sick,"" said one man, who came to the clinic to pick up his  sister after an abortion and found the large crowd inside.    ""If she'd known this, she wouldn't have come.

The demonstrators, after negotiating with La Mesa police and San Diego County  sheriff's deputies, agreed to peacefully march out of the building at a rate of  two every minute until the entire complex was cleared. As the 150 demonstrators  walked out, their colleagues outside, many of whom said they were from Orange  County, cheered them on.    Also outside were large groups of pro-choice advocates, carrying signs and  cheering their cause.    ""They're very insulting,"" Joyce Tavrow of Rancho Bernardo said of the  demonstrators.

0,FT943-2542 ,"FT943-2542 _AN-EISF8AB9FT 940919   FT  19 SEP 94 / This Week: FT guide to crime in the US      By GEORGE GRAHAM   How bad a problem is crime in the US? Opinion polls show more than 20 per cent of those questioned now rate crime as the most serious issue facing the country, more than any other issue. Foreigners share that view; the British Foreign Office issues the same kind of travel warning for Miami that it gives for countries in the midst of civil war. Since the homicide rate in the US is now seven times that of Canada and 20 times Germany's, there is good reason for feeling that way. After all, homicide is now the number three cause of death among elementary and middle school children, and a child is 15 times more likely to die from gunfire in the US than in Northern Ireland. Is it getting worse? In the mind of the public, there is no question. Polls show people are twice as afraid of being murdered as they were just one year ago. But criminologists at the Justice Department say the most reliable statistics indicate that the total number of crimes has fallen from a peak between 1975 and 1982, while violent crime rates have stayed largely the same. Around 32 people per 1,000 households are victims of violent crime in any given year, they say. But the level of violence against specific groups such as teenagers and blacks has risen sharply in recent years. How much of the problem has to do with drugs? The total drug arrest rate has climbed over the last decade from 256 per 100,000 inhabitants to 435 per 100,000, and within that total the rate of arrests for the sale of heroine or cocaine has increased more than eightfold. The rate of drug arrests increases in line with the size of the city, to 1,031 per 100,000 in cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants. And Department of Justice surveys show that two-thirds of all those arrested test positive for some kind of drug. What is the federal government trying to do about it? According to Congressman Charles Schumer, head of the House of Representatives crime committee, left wingers want all prevention and no punishment, while right wingers want all punishment and no prevention. But last month Congress finally passed a crime bill that tries to combine punishment, prevention and gun control. Over six years the bill will provide Dollars 8.8bn to hire up to 100,000 new police officers, Dollars 7.9bn to build prisons and Dollars 6.9bn to pay for social programmes intended to reduce crime, such as drug rehabilitation and improvements to lighting in city parks. It would also ban the manufacture or possession of guns classified as assault weapons and impose tougher sentences for certain crimes: the death penalty for dozens of new federal offences, such as the murder of law enforcement officials, and a mandatory life sentence for a third violent felony. Will it work? Probably not. Crime is overwhelmingly a state and local responsibility, and most federal action on the issue is largely political posturing. Money for more police officers could help some beleaguered local governments, though the cities with the worst murder rates, such as Detroit and Washington, already have some of the largest police forces in proportion to their populations. The assault gun ban will not touch handguns, which account for 83 per cent of all violent crimes involving firearms. Some prevention programmes have proved their worth at a local level, but it is always difficult to duplicate them nationwide. And many local officials doubt whether Congress will actually find the cash to fulfil the bill's promises. What about the tougher sentences? It is traditional to include lots of new death penalties in crime legislation, but mostly these are exotic offences such as the murder of a federal poultry inspector. The death penalty is mostly inflicted for murder, which is a state offence. The federal government last carried out an execution in 1963, for kidnapping. Mandatory life sentences for repeated violent offenders could prevent some crimes committed by released prisoners, like the murder of Polly Klaas in California. But some officials worry that it could simply fill up the prisons with elderly criminals, and force them to release other prisoners early because they don't have enough money to build all the new jails they need. If more executions and more people in prison were the answer, then the US would already be one of the safest places in the world. It is virtually alone in the western world in its insistance on capital punishment; its prison population, with 519 people jailed for every 100,000 citizens, is five times that of other industrialised nations and matched only by Russia's.

Yesterday President Bill Clinton said he was waiting on a report from Ms Janet Reno, the new attorney general, before determining the director's fate. He also pointedly declined to confirm or deny reports of the existence of a short list to succeed Judge Sessions. Prominent on the list was said to be Mr Richard Stearns, now a state judge in Massachussetts but Mr Clinton's contemporary as a Rhodes Scholar in England and like the president, a campaign worker for Senator George McGovern in 1972. The FBI director came under heavy fire from the outgoing Bush administration, which accused him of misuse of public funds for private purposes. His stock had risen a little lately because of early FBI arrests in the World Trade Centre bombing. The administration was also reported not to want to remove him while the siege of a religious cult outside Waco, Texas, drags on. A further indication of of the administration's drive to purge law enforcement of Republican officials was provided yesterday when Ms Reno asked for the resignations of all US attorneys (federal prosecutors) from around the country. Ms Reno said she wanted to 'begin to build a team that represents. . . my views and the views of President Clinton.' US attorneys are political appointees, but more than 90 Republicans have continued to serve. There is one potential controversy to her action yesterday. The Republican US attorney in Washington, Mr Jay Stephens, has been aggressively investigating allegations of corruption against Mr Dan Rostenkwoski, powerful Democratic chairman of the House ways and means committee.

The ultimatum was given by the US, Britain and France after the United Nations Security Council renewed the existing sanctions against Libya. The present sanctions, introduced 16 months ago, prevent the sale of arms to Libya, ban aviation links, and call for a scaling down of diplomatic links. The tough new sanctions would hit Libya in oil-related, financial and technological fields, but it was not clear how significant they would be. The UN imposed sanctions against Libya because of its refusal to hand over the Lockerbie suspects for trial in the US or Britain. The two men are suspected of planting a bomb which blew up Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland in December 1988, killing all 259 people aboard as well as 11 on the ground. The existing sanctions have been extended by the UN five times, and pressure for tougher measures has grown as the dispute has dragged on. But there has been periodic speculation that Libya may be trying to reach some arrangement with western nations to end the row and to avert further sanctions. Diplomats at the UN said that the US wanted to give Libya no more than 30 days to comply with the latest ultimatum, but agreed to allow a little more time under French and British pressure. The proposed future sanctions might encompass a ban on all Libyan oil sales, as well as a freeze on Libyan financial assets, they said. However, European nations that import Libyan oil, such as Italy, have been opposed to expanding the sanctions to include an oil embargo.   Countries:-  LYZ  Libya, Africa.

An Israeli military  official said that so far nine Israelis had died and 50 others  had been injured, most of them seriously. The official added  that the explosion was the result of a suicide attack.    News reports said that a massive fire engulfed the scene of  the explosion. Another Israeli official described the scene as  a horrible sight. News reports have also indicated that, after  this explosion, which shook the Israeli settlement, Israeli  enemy forces surrounded the area, sealed off all roads from and  to the occupied West Bank, and began a series of arrests among  the Palestinians.    Thus, the illusion of peace which is being promoted has been  exposed. It has now been confirmed that real peace could be  achieved only with the return of the occupying invaders, who  have colonized Palestine, to their original homelands, the  return of the Palestinian people to their homeland, and the  establishment of a democratic state of Palestine where  Palestinians, Muslims, Christians, and Jews can live together.  If this is not achieved, there can only be more massacres, more  killings, and more bloodshed.    What happened today confirms an obvious reality -- namely,  that there will be no stability for the invaders, whatever means  of repression they use and however much blood they shed. The  only road of escape for the occupiers is to return immediately  to the countries from which they have come as invaders.     "

The  missile fell in a densely populated residential neighborhood.  Rescue teams are still searching for survivors believed to be  buried under the rubble of the four houses that were leveled.  Numerous houses across a wide radius around the bombing site  also suffered substantial damage.    The missile, which hit one of the poorer districts of Sanaa,  was the 23d to target the capital since the war was triggered by  al-Bid and his separatist coterie. This is in addition to those  that were launched on other civilian installations and the  population in Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, al-Makha, and the Rahidah  Hospital.    The source indicated that the horrific and murderous action  killed or wounded newborns and caused miscarriages. The victims  included a physician whose fingers on his right hand were blown  off while on duty at a nearby hospital.    The security source condemned the action as a treacherous,  gruesome crime. He also condemned the traitor al-Bid's threat  at a news conference of further Scud missile attacks at  innocents and civilian establishments in Sanaa and other Yemeni  cities. This kind of threat, the source said, shows that al-Bid  and his secessionist band are consumed with such hate that they  will not hesitate to perpetrate the most gruesome of crimes  against defenseless innocents comparable to their atrocities  against the homeland and its unity.

RCN radio, in a report from the town about 160 miles north of Bogota, said the death toll had risen to 14 after two of the wounded died from their wounds, but there was no immediate confirmation from police. Reports from the town said the bomb blew up five blocks from the headquarters of USO, Colombia's powerful oil workers' union. USO is in wage talks with the state oil company Ecopetrol and planned a national day of protest yesterday. Mr Cesar Carillo, president of the oil workers' union, told Caracol radio in an interview that the union had been threatened with violence during the last few days as a result of the wage negotiations. 'We don't know if the victims are union members or oil workers,' he said. 'The authorities are still getting information. There is a lot of confusion.' Radio reports said Ecopetrol President Juan Maria Rendon was expected in Barrancabermeja at the time of the blast to inspect company installations but there was no suggestion that he might be among the victims. The last bombing in Colombia occurred on January 30 when fugitive cocaine king Pablo Escobar allegedly set off a car packed with explosives in a busy Bogota shopping street, killing 21 people and wounding dozens. There was no indication that drug traffickers might be responsible for the Barrancabermeja blast. The oil capital is, however, in the centre of a major guerrilla zone. Guerrillas have attacked gold and coal mines, oil rigs and pipelines, power lines, government installations and army patrols.   Countries:-  COZ  Colombia, South America.

They said he was  being held at Yeshugou jail, near the city of Xinan in the  western part of Henan province.    The arrest of the 23-year-old dissident came as part of a  vast security offensive against dissidents in China beginning  early this month. At least 18 people were picked up.    Speaking by telephone on Wednesday, Xinan police said they  ""knew"" Zhai but ""did not know"" where he was.    A family member said the dissident was allowed to see his  youngest sister, Zhai Yujie, on Friday morning, but that the  police would not divulge the reasons for his arrest. Those  close to Zhai, however, suspect he will be held at least until  June 4, the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.    Zhai, number six on the ""list of most-wanted students"" after  the pro-democracy movement was smashed, was arrested in early  1990 and spent three-and-a-half years in prison for  ""counter-revolutionary propaganda"" before being freed last  September 13. His release came just a few days before the  selection of a site for the 2000 summer games. The Chinese  capital lost out to Sydney, Australia.    Three recent arrests of dissident lawyers Zhou Guoqiang,  Yuan  Hongbing and Wang Jiaqi have been confirmed by the authorities  recently. Friends of Yuan and Wang said this week that they had  been unable to receive any word on them despite repeated appeals  to judicial authorities.     "

Both bombs went off in narrow, busy streets among shops and offices, causing panic in the Colombian capital. Police sources told Reuter they believed the bombing had been ordered by the fugitive Medelln cocaine cartel leader Pablo Escobar. The blasts damaged buildings and shattered glass for several blocks around, and the streets were strewn with the wreckage of some 20 cars. Windows were blown out of the Intercontinental-Tequendama, one of city's main hotels. A Reuter reporter at the scene of the hotel blast said: 'People were trying to leap from the upper floors of buildings after the blast to escape the fires. It was total chaos.' The government has accused Mr Escobar of leading a campaign of terror against the state. Over the past two and a half weeks car bombs have exploded in Medelln, Bogota and the oil city of Barrancabermeja, killing 37 people. However, the two Medelln bombs were aimed at Mr Escobar's relatives and properties, and were apparently detonated by a new anti-Escobar group called the 'Pepes' - people persecuted by Pablo Escobar. The authorities have increased the reward offered for information about Mr Escobar to Dollars 7m. At the same time, the Pepes have killed several of Mr Escobar's collaborators and employees in Medelln. After Mr Escobar's escape from jail last July, he was expected to re-surrender quickly, but this now seems unlikely. However, some interpret the new wave of bombs as a last-ditch attempt to force the government to bow to new conditions. The government has said any negotiations would be impossible and Mr Escobar's only option is unconditional surrender.   Countries:-  COZ  Colombia, South America.

Currently, drivers who pass state tests are given  temporary six-month permits to allow them to drive while the checks are being  completed.    Rengstorff said authorities are targeting school bus drivers because ""there  just seems to have been numerous instances where contractor-employed applicants  have been involved in serious bus incidents.""    In recent incidents two bus drivers employed by Laidlaw Transit, the nation's  largest private school bus contractor, have been arrested on suspicion of  driving school buses while drunk. A third Laidlaw driver was arrested for  carrying a loaded gun in his bus. Laidlaw serves the Long Beach Unified School  District.    The committee's chairman, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), said he called  the hearing to examine the procedures used by Laidlaw, other bus companies,  school districts and state agencies.    ""There's something seriously out of whack"" in the system, Katz said. He cited  the recently discovered criminal backgrounds of some school bus drivers,  allegedly faulty procedures of state authorities in licensing drivers and the  poor accident record of private school bus operators.    Laidlaw officials defended their practices, saying the company has instituted a  comprehensive driver safety program.    But Katz said that based on CHP figures the accident rate for all private  school bus contractors is significantly higher than the rate for drivers  employed directly by school districts. The Los Angeles school district employs  1,300 drivers, and the remaining 1,500 who transport the district's students  work for private firms, school officials said.    A specific breakdown of the accident rate for Los Angeles schools was not  available.    According to 1987-88 school year figures for the entire state released by  Katz's office, drivers employed directly by school districts were involved in  nearly seven accidents per million miles compared to almost 11 accidents per  million miles for private bus companies. A spokesman for Katz said those  figures -- the most recent available -- were for buses that carry 20 passengers  or more.    Spike Helmick, deputy CHP commissioner, confirmed the disparity, suggesting  that one reason is that drivers for school districts tend to keep their jobs  longer than do drivers for private contractors.    Complaints about school bus drivers have risen in recent months, following the  arrests of two Laidlaw Transit employees accused of driving buses while drunk  -- one in the San Fernando Valley and the other in San Diego. Laidlaw is paid  about $20 million a year by the Los Angeles Unified School District and is its  largest bus contractor, school officials said.    In January, a Laidlaw driver, Harold Keith Lone, was arrested in Encino as he  prepared to pick up students at Lanai Elementary School. A breath test showed  Lone had a blood-alcohol level of 0.27%, more than three times the legal limit  of 0.08%. Authorities have said that Lone obtained his job by using an alias to  hide a lengthy criminal record, including five drunk driving convictions.    Earlier this month, a school bus driver transporting Clairemont High School  students in San Diego was charged with drunk driving after his bus rear-ended a  pickup truck, injuring three people, according to the CHP.    Moreover, Katz said he was also concerned about another San Diego case in which  Laidlaw driver Victor H. Gomez in 1987 allegedly kidnaped a 5-year-old girl  from a school bus and molested her. A civil lawsuit filed by the child against  Laidlaw is pending. San Diego police said Gomez remains a fugitive.    During Thursday's hearing, Katz expressed shock that Gomez still has a valid  license to drive a school bus. Bill Gengler, a spokesman for the Department of  Motor Vehicles, confirmed that his agency ""had not suspended or revoked""  Gomez's license because ""we had no information from law enforcement or other  sources that would allow us to act.""    Katz complained about the DMV's ""business-as-usual approach"" in such cases.    He also said that Laidlaw and other private bus contractors ""are not  acknowledging their responsibility to develop a better procedure of screening  the drivers.""    Dave Daley, vice president of operations for Laidlaw Transit's Van Nuys-based  operation, acknowledged that when he joined the office ""substantial  improvements were needed.""    Laidlaw has improved its checking of applicant references and training since  Katz's committee had a similar hearing in 1988, Daley said. ""We feel our  procedures have been corrected in a responsive manner,"" he said.    Daley described the latest arrests of drivers as ""isolated"" but said they  pointed up the need to improve staff training to detect drug and alcohol abuse  among drivers.    In an attempt to discourage problems, Laidlaw officials asked the committee to  adopt criminal sanctions against drivers who lie about their background on  employment applications, including a mandatory six-month jail term and a  $10,000 fine for violations.

The Defence Department is reported to have prepared a list of options for President George Bush, including a 'graduated bombing campaign.' Officials are seeking to reinforce the impression that the US is ready to use military force in the very near future if Iraq does not back down in a confrontation with the UN inspection teams seeking to destroy missiles and nuclear production facilities. A UN team is in Iraq this week after the Security Council delivered a stern warning to Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi deputy prime minister, at an angry meeting in New York last week. However, the US has blown hot and cold over its readiness to use force. Mr Bush said he would not rule out any options, but Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary, and Mr Edward Djerejian, the assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, this week sought to play down the likelihood of military action. Michael Littlejohns adds from the UN in New York: Negotiations between the UN and Iraq over the proposed sale of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 920m) worth of Iraqi oil, in part to pay for food and medicines, will re-open in Vienna next Thursday. Baghdad's agreement to resume the talks, broken off last month, was one of the positive results of last week's Security Council meeting. The Council resolution authorising easing of sanctions for limited oil sales expired on Wednesday. Its renewal depends on the outcome of next week's talks.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "
0,FT941-16950 ,"FT941-16950 _AN-EAGC3AA4FT 940107   FT  07 JAN 94 / Terror main weapon in Yemen war of political wills: The Arab nation's new-found democracy and unity are under threat      By ERIC WATKINS      SANAA   The Yemeni government appears to be foundering in the wake of alleged links with international terrorist groups, increased attacks on foreign workers and riots over the rapidly-deteriorating economy. According to Sheikh Abdullah bin Hussein al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni parliament, the political crisis in Yemen is passing through its worst stages and may 'end Yemen's achievements in unity, democracy, and parliamentary elections'. The crisis began last August when vice president Ali Salem al Beidh head of the Yemen Socialist Party, stalked out of Sanaa and returned to his political base in Aden. Said to be angered by the marginalisation of his party by a growing alliance between President Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress and Sheikh Ahmar's Fundamentalist Islah Party, Mr Biedh has remained in Aden, declining to participate in government until Gen Saleh implements an 18-point programme of national reform mainly aimed at improving internal security, integrating the two former armies and curbing corruption, proposed by the socialists in late September. Gen Saleh has so far not given in to Mr Biedh's demand and the resulting stand-off has left Yemen in a state of economic and political disarray. Economic problems were underscored on Tuesday when riots broke out in Taiz, 250km south of Sanaa. Spawned by an inflation rate which has jumped 50 per cent since August, the riot was soon contained by government forces with no deaths reported. But the riots, reminiscent of others in December 1992 which left more than 100 dead, raised fears of widespread unrest as the Yemeni riyal plunged from 70 to 100 to the dollar in unofficial trading on Wednesday and yesterday The government is also unable to control the growing number of attacks on expatriates workers. Sent by helicopter to investigate the bombing of an oil pipeline, two employees of the Yemen-Hunt oil company were kidnapped by tribesmen on Tuesday and have yet to be released. Other tribesmen are reported to have shot at employees of the Canadian Occidental oil company, and at others working for Schlumberger, an oil-support group. Yemen's political and economic headaches were compounded last week when Gen Saleh had to fend off allegations that the US and Egyptian governments had implicated his country in international terrorism. Although neither Washington nor Cairo made the charges openly, the US State Department nonetheless confirmed that there had been 'discussions' with Yemen about its links with groups suspected of terrorism in Egypt. Terrorism and assassination are hardly unknown in Yemen. Indeed, they have almost become a way of life in the battle of political wits between Gen Saleh and Mr Biedh who joined the formerly Marxist south Yemen into an uneasy union with the tribalist north three years ago.  Since then the country has been wracked by repeated violence, most of it directed against the YSP. Victims, they say, of 150 political killings, members of the YSP claim that General Saleh has turned a blind eye to terrorists and, in fact, has shielded them for his own political purposes. Yemen also had a direct brush with international terrorism in December 1992 with the bombing of two hotels in Aden, which left three dead and narrowly missed about 100 US troops billeted there as part of Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. One group of suspects has been tried and convicted while another group is on trial, charged with the formation of terrorist cells aimed at assassinating prominent southern officials, blowing up key political and economic installations, and establishing camps to train other terrorists. Prosecutors say that the conspirators, many of them exiles from the former south, confessed to being veterans of the war in Afghanistan and to having links with backers in Sudan and Egypt. Apart from personal revenge against leaders of the former south, the aim of the group, prosecutors say, was to undermine Yemen's democratic government and replace it with a fundamentalist regime. Ignored by the Saleh regime, with its close ties to fundamentalist groups such as Islah, Aden security forces and the YSP sent details of the terrorist organisation to Egyptian authorities in early December. Prompted by the November 26 assassination attempt on the Egyptian prime minister, Mr Atef Sidqi, Cairo placed Yemeni expatriates under surveillance, cut direct telephone links between the two countries, and sent investigators to Yemen. Since then, the Egyptians have discovered a further plot which, they say, involves four other countries. Although the Egyptian prosecutor this week declined to name them, speculation has since focussed on Iran, Afghanistan, Sudan, and Yemen. 'The crisis has played a part in disfiguring Yemen's international reputation in the sense that it is now threatened with blacklisting as an international terrorist country,' Sheikh Ahmar says, tying the allegations to the contest between General Saleh and Mr Biedh. But Yemen's reputation may yet have more to suffer. French diplomatic sources this week in Sanaa stated that France's counter-intelligence service, DST, has already warned Yemen against possible connections with terrorist groups in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia - connections which North African diplomats in Sanaa have long quietly confirmed.

They discussed the main issues of the Yugoslav crisis and the  situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    President Milosevic stressed that the Serbian side has  complied with the European Union's [EU] demands to provide 33  percent of the territory [of Bosnia-Herzegovina] for the Muslim  republic. He also stressed that the signing of the peace  agreement between the warring sides in the region depends only  on the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo.    The Serb side in the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina  has not waged war for more than seven months now, and the  responsibility for the current armed provocations undoubtedly  lies with the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo. Therefore,  President Milosevic stressed, the threats of bombing the Serb  side are incomprehensible. They encourage the Muslim leadership  to prolong the war and avoid once more the signing of the peace  agreement, which undermines the efforts invested in the peace  process so far.    According to the assessment of the Republic of Serbia, it  would be much more useful for international factors to exert  pressure on the Muslim leadership to accept the peace plan for  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereby peace would be given  preference over war.    President Milosevic told Akashi that the Republic of Serbia  will continue helping to establish a just and lasting peace in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the same time working on the  removal of one-sided assessments by international factors which  help the war-mongers among the Muslim leaders hold on to their  illusions that they will achieve their goals through war.

European pressure, and violence in Lhasa on Monday and yesterday, are embarrassments which Beijing did not want while Washington debates the conditions which it will attach early in June to China's most-favoured nation trading status. Police yesterday used tear gas for a second day running to disperse a group of 100 to 200 Tibetans who gathered outside Jokhang Temple, a shrine in the Tibetan capital. Many shops were closed and police patrols were heavy in Lhasa . Envoys from the 12 EC countries, now back in Beijing, are working on a report about their week-long visit to observe the human rights situation, during which they learned of the arrests of three named individuals. The Danish ambassador, representing the EC presidency, sought to have observers at their trial, and also requested access to them. He was refused. According to European officials, the authorities at first said they had no knowledge of the arrests, but later confirmed them. Western countries believe independence of Tibet from China is unrealistic but want Beijing to discuss the territory's future with Tibetans including the Dalai Lama, their spiritual leader. Reuters newsagency quoted a police spokesman describing Monday's demonstration of about 2,000 people as 'counter-revolutionary activity'. 'It began as a protest in the name of lowering prices for grain and oil, but it changed its nature into a counter-revolutionary activity,' the police officer said.

The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), announcing the fines, said this was a 'warning to companies throughout the world that they may not do business with Libya from or through the United States.' OFAC also said the measures underscored the US administration's 'determination in dealing with the terrorist regime of Muammer Gadaffi.' Among companies named by OFAC were Fina Exploration Libya, a subsidiary of Petrofina; Security Pacific International Bank; Vitol SA Inc, a Houston company; Energoprojekt, based in Yugoslavia; Generale Bank in New York, and Jogobanka of Yugoslavia. The latest OFAC listings coincide with steps at the United Nations to impose limited sanctions against Libya over its refusal to hand over to the US or Britain two Libyans allegedly involved in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. US companies have been banned from doing business with some 60 commercial enterprises and two dozen individuals regarded as Libyan or Libyan-controlled. Malta has not and will not offer to host a trial of Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am airliner, an official government statement said yesterday, Reuter reports from Cairo. 'The position of the government of Malta is that it has made no offer to host any trial. Nor has it any intention to make such an offer,' said the government statement. It was clarifying remarks by Maltese foreign minister Guido de Marco, who Malta would consider a Libyan proposal to allow the two suspects to be tried on the island 'if the parties involved agreed'.

[Al-Ghuwayl] The accusations are based on four pieces of  evidence against the suspects:    1. The fact that 'Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi [one of the  suspects] was in Malta on 7 December. He bought things from  some shop and the shop owner testified to the purchase.    2. Al-Amin Fuhaymah's [second suspect] private diary.    3. The timers, the story of which came to light with the  fall of East Germany. It was discovered that the timers were  also sold to East Germany.    4. The story of the suitcase shipped from Malta. But this  piece of evidence was automatically dropped. Even an FBI report  sent from Frankfurt to its headquarters in the United States  recommended that this piece of evidence be dropped because  shipping an unaccompanied suitcase from a country to another  cannot be done without sending a cable with it and taking  specific administrative measures. The cable is not there and no  measures were taken; it would be difficult to fabricate this  because a long time passed before the indictment was issued.    If some ""suitcases"" passed, they must have entered from  Frankfurt airport without going through the detection machine.  This casts much doubt on those who carried out this operation.  The suitcases were American-made.    There is also a stunning thing that we will reveal soon; it  will deal a crushing blow to the accusations against the Libyans.    [Rumayh] What is that?    [Al-Ghuwayl] On 30 December 1988, CIA agents visited Mr.  Polier [name as published], owner of the factory producing the  timers used in the bombing crime. They sought to wrest a  confession from him that he sold the timers only to Libya  although the piece of the timer had not yet been discovered in  the plane's wreckage.    More surprisingly, this timer piece, over which Libya was  accused, was not found by the Scottish police but by American  FBI agents in Scotland!    This indicates that the accusation against Libya was  deliberate and prearranged.    More seriously, the CIA asked the aforementioned person to  say that he personally went to Malta on 20 December -- a few  days before the incident -- to install the timers on the  explosives on behalf of the Libyans. Under pressure, he wrote  them something to that effect. However, circumstances did not  serve them; at that specific time the same person was already  booked on another flight to a different airport. They,  therefore, did not use the piece of paper he wrote for them.    Regarding the testimony of the Maltese vendor who claimed  that things were bought from him, it is invalid. His testimony  against the suspects said that the purchase was made on a rainy  day and that there was a football match between Italy and  Germany on that day. We checked the weather bulletin but found  that it was not raining that day. We also checked the dates of  matches but did not find any match on that day. The match to  which the witness referred was played on 23 November 1988,  several months before that date.    There remains the story of Fuhaymah's diary. These are the  papers taken from his diary. There is nothing in them. All  that happened is that the accusers of al-Amin Fuhaymah joined  some lines together and read them as they wanted. This is the  paper, please read it! ""'Abd-al-Basit coming from Zurich with  Salvo. Take the tanks."" What is this? Various points on  various topics and impressions. They put them together and made  accusations out of them according to their whims.    [Rumayh] From your own point of view, how could this problem  be solved?    [Al-Ghuwayl] This is a media effort. I believe that even  among the Arabs there are those who believe that Libya is  involved. The fact is that whoever carefully reads the  accusations and the answers to them and whoever is versed in the  legal precedents, even those in the United States, on the  acceptance of holding trials in foreign countries without  insisting on demanding an extradition -- whoever carefully reads  this will discover that all these accusations are fabricated.  We are now in the process of preparing booklets to explain  these matters from all the angles. We will distribute these  booklets to the public, intellectuals, decisionmaking centers,  and even the Arab leaders themselves.    [Rumayh] Time is in favor of which side?    [Al-Ghuwayl] So far it is in their favor. Nevertheless,  certain things happened recently that refuted many of the false  accusations. Following the downfall of East Germany and during  the trial of intelligence officers, it was proved that the  ""timers"" used in the bombings were also delivered to East  Germany. It is not true that they were only delivered to Libya.    [Rumayh] Are the two suspects leading a normal life?    [Al-Ghuwayl] They are not leading a normal life. As is  known, they are confined to their houses. According to the  Montreal treaty, the authorities guarantee their presence so  that they can be brought in at any time. We have not asked for  changing this treatment so that the option of their trial in  Libya will also remain open.     "

They represent the command  group, which includes the base of the organization's military  wing in the central region, and the officials in charge of  surveillance, finance, liaison, and implementation.    In the security campaigns, seven modern vehicles of various  types were seized. One of those cars was used in the  assassination of martyr Major General Ra'uf Khayrat in al-Haram  on 9 April and another in the attack against the officers of Abu  Za'bal prison on 26 March, when explosive charges were thrown at  them on the Cairo-Ismailia agricultural road.    When residences of members of the command and implementation  groups were searched, large amounts of explosive, chemical, and  incendiary materials were found along with some sketches and  information about officials on the assassination list and some  cash.    The source said the operation was part of activity by the  State Security Intelligence following the death of Tal'at Yasin  Hammam, the leader of the terrorist groups. Security operations  were developed using information and seized organizational  papers about all recent terrorist activities.    The source said that in light of information gathered from  close surveillance of some terrorists abroad and their contacts  inside the country, the State Security Intelligence managed to  define the general picture of the terrorists' activity and of  certain internal organizations trying to support those  terrorists and push them to implement their various operations.    Acting on this information, the source explained, the State  Security Intelligence, assisted by the various investigative  agencies, continued to implement its security plan to arrest the  remaining terrorist groups that by their acts are trying to  prove they still exist in the country.    The source said that the operation was also based on the  intensive investigations and accurate monitoring carried out by  the State Security Intelligence after receiving permission from  the chief public attorney and in coordination with antiterrorism  forces and the various criminal investigation agencies.    The official security source said that, still backed by the  permission of the High State Security Prosecution Office, the  security forces extended the arrest operations to include those  responsible for liaison and conveying assignments from the  leaders of the organization inside prisons to leaders outside.  It became certain that this liaison mission was carried out by  two lawyers who used their profession to serve their secret  organizational activities. One of these is lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Ibrahim Madani, who was arrested and  accused in connection with several extremist cases in Isna in  the Governorate of Qina. Investigations and seized  organizational documents proved that he was also in charge of  financing the organization from funds he received from the  leader of these groups, Tal'at Muhammad Yasin Hammam.    The source said the suspect distributed sums amounting to  45,000 Egyptian pounds and $3,000.    The security source pointed out that this suspect is one of  the dangerous terrorist elements that played a prominent role in  the recent terrorist acts. He was arrested on 3 July 1990 for  his dangerous activity in the terrorist groups, and in the same  year he, along with others, were charged with attacking citizens  in Isna and preventing them from visiting cemeteries. He was  also accused in Case No. 4116 in 1991 in Isna, when he was  arrested for distributing leaflets promoting extremist thought  and inciting violence.    The source said the High State Security Prosecution issued a  warrant for his arrest for his involvement in Case No. 235 of  1994, concerning the military wing of the terrorist groups  organization, which is currently being examined.    The security source said that the defendants told State  Security Prosecution investigators that Madani was their link to  the group's leader, Hammam. Madani was also in charge of  communication between the group's imprisoned and free leaders, a  task he performed under cover of his work as a lawyer and on the  orders of Hammam.    The source said that the defendants' confessions also show  that Madani was in charge of the finances of the group.  Investigators have learned of seven instances in which Madani  received funds from abroad totalling 45,000 Egyptian pounds and  $3,000. The entire sum was used to finance the group's  terrorist activities.    Security forces arrested Madani on the night of 26 April at  his office in al-Haram, the source said. They took him along as  they searched his home in al-Talibiyah in al-Haram. There  security sources seized documents and other material. While the  security forces were leading Madani to his second residence in  Warraq al-'Arab, which they intended to search, he experienced  difficulty in breathing and lost consciousness. He was  instantly taken to the al-Manyal al-Jami'i hospital for  treatment, where doctors diagnosed his case as severe asthma and  kept him in the hospital for treatment. The next day, 27 April,  the hospital notified us that the defendant had died of lung  failure, a complication of severe asthma, the source said.    The security source added that the State Security  Intelligence forces continued to act on the information they had  already gathered. Acting in cooperation with other security  organs, they prepared plans to raid 25 hideouts of the military  wing of the extremist terrorist groups in farm and mountain  areas in the Asyut and Suhaj Governorates.    In these hideouts, the security forces seized four automatic  weapons, a pistol, 1,600 7.62-mm rounds, 300 9-mm rounds, 18 kg  of TNT, 29 detonators, six timers, and electric wiring devices.  The raids also led to the arrest of the deputy leader of the  military wing of the terrorist groups in south Egypt. The  officials in charge of communications and accommodations were  also arrested. So was a group of terrorists wanted by police in  connection with 40 terrorist attacks against police officials,  trains, and Nile cruise boats in south Egypt. The defendants  have been referred to the competent prosecution offices.    The individuals who were arrested in these raids confessed  to  involvement in the assassination of Asyut Security Commander  Brigadier General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi; and Lieutenant Colonel  Mustafa Khalil Tuni and First Lieutenant Zaki Bahjat, both of  the Asyut Security Department. They also admitted involvement  in the attack on Bank Abu-Tij in Asyut and the bombing in  al-Bunuk Square in Asyut, according to the Interior Ministry  source.    The security source noted that as a result of these  security operations against the leaders, cadres, and members of  the terrorist elements, 98 leading figures have been arrested  and approximately 500,000 Egyptian pounds have been seized. In  addition, a Goryunov machine gun, five automatic weapons, three  pistols, three Enfield automatic rifles, a Russian-made pistol,  25 FON [initials as received] bombs, a large quantity of live  ammunition, 190 kg of highly explosive TNT, a large quantity of  chemicals, ready-made explosive devices and tools and material  for making them, fax machines, and wireless telephones have been  seized.    The source noted that the Higher State Security Prosecution  Office is questioning the arrested defendants. Prosecutors have  also inspected all the places and dens where the defendants were  arrested and have seized all items found there as part of the  investigations. The source pointed out that to maintain the  confidentiality of the investigations, the State Security  Intelligence has not announced the names of all the defendants  since more arrests are being conducted. The source noted that  investigations and surveillance operations are still underway to  arrest the remaining terrorists still at large, who include the  following important figures: Hasan Salih Hasan Mahmud, Hasan  al-Sayyid Hamid Khayri, Mahmud Muhammad Sa'id Salim, Jamal  'Abd-al-Hamid 'Abd-al-Nasir, Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi  'Abd-al-Baqi, Rif'at Zaydan 'Abdallah, Islam Ahmad Muhammad  Ibrahim al-Ghamri. In addition, there are other terrorist  elements whose activities are being monitored abroad.    The Interior Ministry appeals to citizens who have any  information on these terrorists to report it to the nearest  police station. It stresses that it is fully aware of all the  activities by some quarters that are supporting terrorism in one  way or another to serve their own interests. These quarters use  some of the incidents that may occur in the course of the  confrontation with terrorists as an opportunity to boost their  own image among the masses. The ministry emphasizes that it  will stand firmly and decisively against these quarters should  they try to act against law and order under this cover, which  only aims to create unrest among the masses.    The source added that the Interior Ministry is keeping a  close watch on the activities of the terrorist groups while  adhering to its firm stances that abide by the law. It  appreciates the people's support for its decisive confrontation  with the criminal and terrorist elements targeting the nation.  The ministry will announce within a few days the names of a  number of arrested terrorists who have repented and renounced  extremism and all forms of terrorist practices.    While emphasizing this strong position, the Interior  Ministry  calls on the people to adhere to the principles of religion and  denounce the terrorist acts that run contrary to the noble  Islamic faith and undermine the march of economic reform, which  seeks to serve the interests of the nation and its people.

0,FT944-609 ,"FT944-609 _AN-ELXAIAD1FT 941224   FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: Political grief and poetic fire - Arkady Ostrovsky on two women whose memories survived the Gulag      By ARKADY OSTROVSKY   THIS I CANNOT FORGET by Anna Larina Hutchinson Pounds 25, 384 pages THE AKHMATOVA JOURNALS 1938-1941 ed. by Lydia Chukovskaya Collins Pounds 20, 320 pages For Russians, to mention one of the years 1937, 1938, 1939 is to evoke pictures of arrests, tortures, and death. Anna Larina's memoirs and Lydia Chukovskaya's journals are accounts of two who survived. At the centre of Anna Larina's memoirs is the politician Nikolai Bukharin, a leader of the Bolshevik party. The focus of Chukovskaya's journals is one of the most brilliant Russian poets of the 20th century - Anna Akhmatova. But these books are also the sagas of two women, Anna Larina and Lydia Chukovskaya, who lived in the presence of great people and who devoted their memories to them. Born in 1914 and adopted by Yuri Larin, an old Bolshevik and Lenin's close ally, Anna Larina grew up in the luxurious rooms of the Metropol Hotel, the residence of the party elite. It was here that, at the age of 11, she wrote her first love-letter to Nikolai Bukharin, then 41 and 'favourite of the entire party'. Too embarrassed to deliver it herself, she gave it to a stranger. This 'stranger' was Stalin. Nine years later Anna Larina married Nikolai Bukharin. Three years after that, in 1937, Bukharin was arrested, tortured and destroyed both mentally and physically. His 23-year-old wife was also arrested and sent to the Gulag, where she spent almost 20 years. The first few chapters of Larina's book show us camps, humiliating interrogations and KGB cells. But her account reveals that Stalin had decided to destroy Bukharin, one of his strongest opponents, back in 1928. Only in 1937 had Stalin gained enough power to implement his plan. By this stage, simply to kill Bukharin was not enough: Stalin needed a show trial. The most powerful part of Larina's book describes the last months of Bukharin's life in the Kremlin before his arrest. The slow and sadistic demolition of the human will, the detailed description of the 'theatricality' of Stalin's methods of moral destruction, are more disturbing than any of the Gulag scenes. The book reads as though Larina is still defending Bukharin in the interrogator's office. The western reader may 'regret Larina's loyalty to the Bolshevik's Revolution of her childhood', writes Stephen Cohen in his introduction. Yet the book is strikingly honest; it was written by one of the generation of devoted idealists, and it takes us into the very depth of a revolutionist's mentality. In 1986 Bukharin was rehabilitated and Anna Larina was able to deliver his letter, 'To A Future Generation of Party Leaders'. Yet his vindication did not last long. As one of the initiators of the New Economic Policy in the 1930s, Bukharin is now blamed as a communist and one of the discredited founders of the Socialist system in Russia. While the court drama unfolded in the corridors of the Kremlin, in a small flat in Leningrad Akhmatova was composing some of her most powerful poems. Akhmatova and Lydia Chukovskaya, daughter of a famous Russian children's poet, were brought together by the arrests of the poet's son and Chukovskaya's husband. Since she was aware that her diary could be confiscated at any time, most of the entries are concerned with conversations on literary matters and the arrests are not mentioned. Russians of this generation had to have good memories because everything that it was unwise to write down had to be mentally recorded. Anna Larina had memorised Bukharin's last political testament. Chukovskaya, who had a photographic memory, recorded by heart many of Akhmatova's poems. Akhmatova would write parts of her Requiem down on scraps of paper, and give them to Chukovskaya to memorise. Afterwards they would be burnt. Many of these poems are printed at the end of the book. Akhmatova had been educated in the same prestigious lyceum as Pushkin, had married a man who was both an officer of the White army and a brilliant poet, and was a member of the most elite literary circles in Russia. Then, during the 1930s, she was locked into a small room in a communal flat in Leningrad, and denied all opportunities to write and publish. 'Her face is grey, drawn, her feet are swollen. She does not leave the house' recorded Chukovskaya in 1939; a sorry comparison with the portrait painted of Akhmatova by Modigliani in Paris in 1910. Chukovskaya's accounts do not contain horror stories about camps and prisons, but record the doomed, paranoid atmosphere of Akhmatova's life in Leningrad. Perhaps the poet's real name, 'Gorenko', contained a prophesy about her tragic life: in Russian, the name contains the roots of two words  -fire and grief.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

THE ACTION FOLLOWS THE ARREST OF THREE DRIVERS.      By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SACRAMENTO      The California Highway Patrol, prompted by mounting concern over the safety of  children who ride to school on buses, announced Thursday that the agency will  tighten the application process for school bus drivers to obtain licenses.    Robert Rengstorff, chief of enforcement for the CHP, told the Assembly  Transportation Committee that beginning June 1, 180-day temporary licenses will  no longer be issued to drivers employed by school districts and private school  bus companies.    Under the CHP plan, developed during the past few weeks, applicants for permits  to drive school buses will be licensed only after fingerprint and background  checks are completed. Currently, drivers who pass state tests are given  temporary six-month permits to allow them to drive while the checks are being  completed.    Rengstorff said authorities are targeting school bus drivers because ""there  just seems to have been numerous instances where contractor-employed applicants  have been involved in serious bus incidents.""    In recent incidents two bus drivers employed by Laidlaw Transit, the nation's  largest private school bus contractor, have been arrested on suspicion of  driving school buses while drunk. A third Laidlaw driver was arrested for  carrying a loaded gun in his bus.    The committee's chairman, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), said he called  the hearing to examine the procedures used by Laidlaw, other bus companies,  school districts and state agencies.    ""There's something seriously out of whack"" in the system, Katz said. He cited  the recently discovered criminal backgrounds of some school bus drivers,  allegedly faulty procedures of state authorities in licensing drivers and the  poor accident record of private school bus operators.    Laidlaw officials defended their practices, saying the company has instituted a  comprehensive driver safety program.    But Katz said that based on CHP figures the accident rate for all private  school bus contractors is significantly higher than the rate for drivers  employed directly by school districts. The Los Angeles school district employs  1,300 drivers, and the remaining 1,500 who transport the district's students  work for private firms, school officials said.    A specific breakdown of the accident rate for Los Angeles schools was not  available.    According to 1987-88 school year figures for the entire state released by  Katz's office, drivers employed directly by school districts were involved in  nearly seven accidents per million miles compared to almost 11 accidents per  million miles for private bus companies. A spokesman for Katz said those  figures -- the most recent available -- were for buses that carry 20 passengers  or more.    Spike Helmick, deputy CHP commissioner, confirmed the disparity, suggesting  that one reason is that drivers for school districts tend to keep their jobs  longer than do drivers for private contractors.    Complaints about school bus drivers have risen in recent months, following the  arrests of two Laidlaw Transit employees accused of driving buses while drunk  -- one in the San Fernando Valley and the other in San Diego. Laidlaw is paid  about $20 million a year by the Los Angeles Unified School District and is its  largest bus contractor, school officials said.    In January, a Laidlaw driver, Harold Keith Lone, was arrested in Encino as he  prepared to pick up students at Lanai Elementary School. A breath test showed  Lone had a blood-alcohol level of 0.27%, more than three times the legal limit  of 0.08%. Authorities have said that Lone obtained his job by using an alias to  hide a lengthy criminal record, including five drunk driving convictions.    Earlier this month, a school bus driver transporting Clairemont High School  students in San Diego was charged with drunk driving after his bus rear-ended a  pickup truck, injuring three people, according to the CHP.    Moreover, Katz said he was also concerned about another San Diego case in which  Laidlaw driver Victor H. Gomez in 1987 allegedly kidnaped a 5-year-old girl  from a school bus and molested her. A civil lawsuit filed by the child against  Laidlaw is pending. San Diego police said Gomez remains a fugitive.    During Thursday's hearing, Katz expressed shock that Gomez still has a valid  license to drive a school bus. Bill Gengler, a spokesman for the Department of  Motor Vehicles, confirmed that his agency ""had not suspended or revoked""  Gomez's license because ""we had no information from law enforcement or other  sources that would allow us to act.""    Katz complained about the DMV's ""business-as-usual approach"" in such cases.    He also said that Laidlaw and other private bus contractors ""are not  acknowledging their responsibility to develop a better procedure of screening  the drivers.""    Dave Daley, vice president of operations for Laidlaw Transit's Van Nuys-based  operation, acknowledged that when he joined the office ""substantial  improvements were needed.""    Laidlaw has improved its checking of applicant references and training since  Katz's committee had a similar hearing in 1988, Daley said. ""We feel our  procedures have been corrected in a responsive manner,"" he said.    Daley described the latest arrests of drivers as ""isolated"" but said they  pointed up the need to improve staff training to detect drug and alcohol abuse  among drivers.    In an attempt to discourage problems, Laidlaw officials asked the committee to  adopt criminal sanctions against drivers who lie about their background on  employment applications, including a mandatory six-month jail term and a  $10,000 fine for violations.

Daley described the latest arrests of drivers as ""isolated"" but said they  pointed up the need to improve staff training to detect drug and alcohol abuse  among drivers.    In an attempt to discourage problems, Laidlaw officials asked the committee to  adopt criminal sanctions against drivers who lie about their background on  employment applications, including a mandatory six-month jail term and a  $10,000 fine for violations.

UN and relief officials said more than  100,000 Sudanese were fleeing a major onslaught by government  warplanes and troops against rebel-held territory in the  drought-hit south.    The offensive could be the final push by Khartoum's Islamic  fundamentalist military government to end the decades-old  rebellion in the black and largely Christian south, diplomats  and aid workers said.    The aid workers said a government ban on relief flights to  southern areas along the Ugandan border had disrupted food  supplies to about 200,000 displaced people living on aid. The  UN has appealed for funds to continue relief operations in the  south, where agriculture, already thrown into chaos by the civil  war, has also been hit by a severe drought.    The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) said that  ""more than 281 civilians were killed or wounded"" in the  bombardment and bombing of Mundri, in Western Equatoria province.    There was no independent confirmation as most aid workers  left Mundri last week when government forces closed in on rebels  defending the town.    In a statement released here Monday, one of the two rival  SPLA factions said it had repelled the government offensive and  the army was retreating northwards from Mundri. A spokesman for  John Garang's mainstream faction said the rebels had killed 67  government soldiers, but the claim was also unconfirmed.    The SPLA splintered into two factions in 1991, and the  government has since taken advantage of the rebels' internal  divisions to drive them out of most of the southern garrison  towns which they had captured.

Mr de Klerk has recently been facing a public outcry over attacks on whites by blacks, in which several people, including schoolchildren, have been killed. His ministers have raised the fear that such attacks could spark revenge violence, and spiralling inter-racial conflict. Mr de Klerk said a solution to political violence should top the agenda at multi-party democracy talks due to begin again next week. Parliament would be asked to vote on suspending the moratorium on the death penalty adopted three years ago. He favoured the death penalty for certain extreme crimes, but MPs would be allowed to vote according to their conscience. Recalling the slaughter of six black schoolchildren near Pietermaritzburg earlier this month and last Friday's killing of a mother and two children near Johannesburg, he said: 'This is barbaric and totally unacceptable in a civilised society.' Reservists would be mobilised to boost security forces manpower in an unspecified 'action plan' to stabilise troubled areas. Mr de Klerk called on the radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) to distance itself from guerrilla attacks by its military wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), and said police had arrested 18 APLA members. More arrests would follow. The government would hold the PAC responsible for APLA's actions, he said, but refrained from repeating an earlier government insistence that the PAC repudiate APLA as a condition of its participation in next week's talks. Black gunmen have killed 10 whites since December in attacks on commuters, a club, a restaurant and a farm.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Prosecutor General de Greiff has reappeared with firm steps.  This time, speaking to Attorney General Arrieta, Justice  Minister Gonzalez, and hundreds of agents of the Attorney  General's Office, he defended the benefits of the law on  surrender and reduction of penalties in Colombia, and questioned  the double standards of the United States on the subject.    [Begin de Greiff recording] The United States criticizes  Colombia because supposedly we have very mild sentences against  drug traffickers, especially when they surrender to justice.  They claim that the United States has the right system, which  consists of very tough sentences. Those high sentences are  applied to some Colombians, but I do not know of any case in  which U.S. drug traffickers have given life sentences. [end  recording]    De Greiff also referred to the possible surrender of Cali  Cartel leaders.    [Begin de Greiff recording] I believe that would be their  best choice because otherwise, the Prosecutor General's Office  will continue its policy of pursuing them.

De Greiff also proposed a legislative reform to monitor  arrests in Colombia.     "

A German man and a Spanish woman were taken to a hospital,  the agency said. The third tourist, who is Dutch, was treated  for light injuries and discharged.    Investigators said the device, a fragmentation bomb,  exploded  at noon (0900 GMT) in the gardens of the historic mosque and  museum.    It was the second time in four days that tourist attractions  had been the target of attacks. On Thursday a bomb explosion  injured four people, including two Romanian women, in the heart  of the city's historic tourist district. [see previous Terrorism  Report]    Although there was no immediate claim of responsibility for  either attack, police suspect they were the work of the outlawed  separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).    There was no clear indication that the bombing was linked to  the PKK's earlier threat to disrupt Sunday's municipal elections.    The separatist group operates mainly in Turkey's  southeastern, predominately Kurdish region. But last summer  they announced that they would begin attacking cities and  tourist sites in western Turkey.    Since that announcement, attacks on tourist sites have been  rare, but several attacks have been perpetrated, notably in  Antalya, on the southern Mediterranean coast, and in Istanbul.    The Saint Sophia mosque on the western side of Istanbul is a  sixth century Byzantine church that was transformed into a  mosque when Constantinople was taken over by the Turks in 1453.  The site attracts thousands of tourists every month.     "

No details on the purpose of the visit were made available yesterday. But diplomats in New York stressed that the trip was not prompted by any movement in the deadlock between Libya and the UN. The visit appears designed rather to keep channels of communication open between the UN and Tripoli. Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, UN undersecretary-general, is expected to arrive in Tripoli at the weekend. He visited Tripoli earlier this year to call on Col Gadaffi to hand over the suspects and is expected to repeat the demand in a meeting with the Libyan leader. As the secretary-general's representative, Mr Petrovsky has no brief to negotiate with Col Gadaffi, but rather will reiterate the terms of UN resolution 731, which calls on Libya to hand over the Lockerbie suspects and four men accused by France of being behind the bombing of a UTA airliner and for Tripoli concretely to dissociate itself from acts of terrorism. 'This is not mediation, just communication,' said a western diplomat at the UN. Mr Petrovsky will tell the Libyan government that air, arms and diplomatic sanctions placed on April 15 will remain in force until Libya complies with resolution 731. Countries applying the sanctions, under UN resolution 748, are expected to give a progress report on their compliance to the UN Security Council on May 15.

Insurers have been hardest hit by the two IRA bombs in the City. Claims from the Baltic exchange bomb in April 1992 amounted to Pounds 300m, including about Pounds 100m for interruption to business. Claims from the Bishopsgate bomb, a year later, totalled Pounds 500m, with about Pounds 150m for business interruption. Losses from other smaller bombs amount to less than Pounds 10m, said Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British Insurers. In Northern Ireland the government has paid more than Pounds 620m since the late 1960s to compensate property owners for damage. Losses rose to Pounds 50m in 1976-77 before falling steadily to Pounds 15m in 1986-87, but the bill in 1991-92 was Pounds 33m. After the London bombs, insurers withdrew cover for terrorism from standard commercial policies. It is offered as a separate policy, with insurance companies covering their own exposures through Pool Re, a company owned by the insurance industry and backed by the government. The decision by Pool Re to charge more to businesses in central London and other areas judged to be terrorist targets than those in less vulnerable areas caused considerable controversy. Mr Baker said these problems had been overcome by insurers reducing some expensive premiums in return for the installation or adoption of security precautions. Mr Baker said changes were not likely for at least a year. Mr Baker argued for the maintenance of security, such as the restrictions of traffic in the City, and said there had to be a degree of caution.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Wang was pulled in for  questioning at 7:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), friends said, adding that  he was released several hours later.    His interrogation followed the broadcast Monday of an  interview Wang gave to the American ABC television network  regarding last week's police sweep of dissidents in Beijing and  Shanghai. ""If the government continues their widespread arrests  then we will at least have to engage in collective protest,""  Wang said in the interview.    Wang had been picked up last Wednesday and held for 24  hours,  during which time he was told to leave Beijing ahead of the  annual session of the Chinese parliament which opens Thursday.  Wang was released from prison on parole in February last year  after serving two years of a four-year jail term for his leading  role in the 1989 pro-democracy movement.    His latest interrogation came as tension between Washington  and Beijing over the dissident crackdown intensified, with harsh  words flying between the two governments just days before the  visit here of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. China  indicated once again that it would not tolerate external  pressure on the issue of human rights, slamming U.S.  condemnation of its ongoing police sweep and accusing Washington  of interference in its internal affairs.    China has detained at least eight activists in the past  week,  including the country's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng.  Some dissidents, including Wei, have been released while others  are thought to have been escorted from the capital to their  hometowns.     "

0,FT932-771 ,"FT932-771 _AN-DF0AKADYFT 930626   FT  26 JUN 93 / Customs aims to hit Channel smugglers      By ANDREW JACK   BRITISH CUSTOMS officials are planning a big crackdown on cross-Channel bootleggers. Officers from the investigation division of HM Customs  Excise are preparing raids in the next few weeks on up to seven teams of professional smugglers it has identified as a result of surveillance and intelligence-gathering. The action follows two raids in recent weeks that led to the seizure of up to Pounds 100,000 in goods and questioning of 18 individuals. Officials will also lobby the authorities to revoke the alcohol licences of any shops and pubs caught accepting goods on which no duty has been paid. Two men charged with evading duty on 11 tons of cans and bottles of beer were remanded until July 9 at Thames court, east London, yesterday after the first successful prosecution of an evader last month. Up to the end of May, 24 cases had led to arrests and charges concerning goods worth Pounds 142,000; 243 were proceeding to prosecution or fines on goods worth Pounds 419,000; and 175 cases involving goods totalling Pounds 18,409 had been dealt with simply through seizure. The actions reflect a shift of Customs resources from border controls towards greater use of intelligence to detect likely duty evaders. Since the start of the year, anyone is entitled to import 'reasonable quantities' of alcohol and tobacco for personal use. Customs officers believe that relatively little systematic smuggling has taken place. Mr Tim Hampson of the Brewers' Society called the removal of restrictions for personal use 'a bootleggers' charter' that was affecting the trade of brewers, pubs and off-licences around the country, particularly in the south-east.

The embassy, in a brief statement, said Iran ""strongly  rejects and condemns any act of terrorism against the life of  innocent people and considers it unislamic and inhuman.""    ""Since Zionist circles are trying to damage the prestige of  the Islamic Republic of Iran by creating false terrorist  scenarios, we highly urge the Thai authorities to remain more  vigilant on the events,"" it said.    It was the embassy's first public response to the arrests  last week of three Iranians suspected to be responsible for the  sabotage plot which police believed was intended against the  Israeli Embassy in Bangkok. [passage omitted]    The three suspects were escorted to the Criminal Court,  tightly guarded by heavily-armed police commandos, yesterday to  be remanded for 12 more days as requested by investigators.    They were transferred to the Khlong Prem Central Prison for  detention after the court approved a police request for the  remand.    Investigators said they needed some more time to complete  the  questioning of 10 more witnesses and collect evidence to  substantiate charges against the three in court.    They also asked the court to deny any bail request for the  suspects, fearing they could flee.    Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen Sophon  Warachanon said yesterday he expected the suspects to be charged  in court in 10 days.     "
0,FT933-1646 ,"FT933-1646 _AN-DIWC2ABKFT 930923   FT  23 SEP 93 / Corporate bribe structure starts to crack: Robert Thomson on changed relations between Japan's politicians and contractors      By ROBERT THOMSON   WHEN a television microphone was rammed in his face and reporters pursued his black limousine down a Tokyo back street, Mr Teruzo Yoshino, the patriarch of Japan's construction industry, must have sensed that he was falling from grace. The end of courtesy in Japan means the beginning of trouble for accused politicians and executives, guilty or not, as associates and journalists are indicating that they no longer feel compelled to cultivate a long-term friendship. By arresting the venerable Mr Yoshino, 75, head of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors and chairman of Shimizu, the country's leading construction company, the prosecutors' office is attempting to alter the terms of a most important friendship, that between the politician and the contractor. Mr Yoshino, taken into custody on Monday, and two other Shimizu executives arrested yesterday - Mr Hirokuki Koyama, a vice-chairman, and Mr Akikazu Matsumoto, a managing director - are claimed to have given Y10m (Pounds 63,000) to Mr Fujio Takeuchi, former governor of Ibaraki prefecture north of Tokyo. This was in the alleged hope that their company would win a share of a planned prefectural complex and medical university. Before a rush of arrests over the past year, most Japanese were aware that politicians and contractors had stitched together unsavoury deals. Politicians provided the projects and the construction companies ensured their local member had cash to cope with an expensive election campaign. But the prosecutors' office was surprised by the depth of personal corruption uncovered during investigations. Tolerance of illegal links was based on an understanding that, a few banquets aside, most contractors' money went on political fighting funds and not into personal bank accounts. Not that Mr Yoshino was guilty of excess, nor necessarily of anything else, though the Construction Ministry has already suspended Shimizu from bidding for public works contracts for four months. 'I would never do anything as silly as attempt to bribe someone,' insisted Mr Yoshino shortly before his detention. Wedged between two investigators, Mr Yoshino, without the dignity of a tie, was driven to the Tokyo Detention Centre and took with him the reputation of Japan's construction industry, allegedly corrupt in its collusion and competition to win contracts. US criticism of Japan's construction market has been aimed at the collusion embodied in dango, the cartels which traditionally organised the outcome of contract awards. But the 18 arrests arising from alleged corruption in prefectures north of Tokyo can be traced to the breakdown of industry collusion and the outbreak of fierce competition. Leading contractors admit to courting Mr Takeuchi, who resigned as Ibaraki's governor after having been charged with receiving Y55m in bribes. Mr Yoshino, who went to the same high school as Mr Takeuchi, says he visited Ibaraki after learning that executives from rival companies had done the same in the hope of winning contracts. The executives were right to respect the influence of Mr Takeuchi, who is said to have informed officials presiding over contract awards that 'I met Mr X of Y company and he is a wonderful guy'. Prosecutors have leaked details of restaurant dinners at which an empty shopping bag was allegedly left behind for a contractor to pay financial tribute to the then governor. By targeting Mr Yoshino, the prosecutors were suggesting that the pre-bid bidding for the Ibaraki governor's favours was a national trend which had to be stopped. The prosecutors judged that a lower-profile investigation into lesser officials would not have the necessary impact on politicians or their contractor friends. Having struck at Shimizu, the prosecutors are concentrating on two other leading companies. The campaign is directed more at a corporate culture than at individuals, but companies are often quick to disown executives taken into custody. As Mr Yoshino knows, regardless of his guilt, the next stage of his fall will come if the company suggests that he acted alone and that it 'regrets' the incident. Shimizu is still defending the chairman: 'We had conducted an internal investigation into the bribery allegations and we cannot believe that they are true.' Industry specialists said Shimizu, which receives just under a fifth of its total orders from the public sector, could miss out on contracts worth as much as Y100bn. However, that figure does not include potential losses from private clients now unwilling to hire the company. The arrest of the Shimizu executives puts added pressure on the Construction Ministry to devise a bidding process for public works projects that gives value for money and ensures fairer competition. US officials want an end to a system in which bidders are designated by government officials, who are supposed to use technical competence, safety records and financial health, not conviviality, as their guide. The Construction Ministry says the designated system ensures that only qualified companies compete for projects, but it has never made clear how companies are assessed, making the system prone to abuse. If the prosecutors have their way, the ministry will be more open about the designation process and less open to overtures from politicians.   Companies:-  Shimizu Construction.

Raymond J. Orlando, 56, was arrested by Huntington Beach police at his Trotter  Road home Tuesday evening, capping a five-month investigation into alleged  fraud by city contractors.    The probe was conducted by the special assignment unit of the Orange County  district attorney's office, according to Police Lt. Ed McErlain.

Officials with the Long Beach-based chain that operates Ventura Family Planning  Associates and an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union complained  that police effectively sided with Operation Rescue activists by not clearing  an access path to the clinic last Thursday and waiting until afternoon to  remove protesters.    ""I find that unreasonable,"" said Carol Sobel, an ACLU attorney. ""If you only  have 75 protesters, you can open access to a clinic in a minute.""    Ventura Police Capt. Kenneth Thompson defended the department's response, which  culminated in the peaceful arrest of 19 Operation Rescue protesters.      Already Barricaded    ""When everyone arrived to have the clinic opened, the pro-life people already  had the doors barricaded,"" he said. ""We could have grabbed those people and  dragged them out, but that wasn't a good option. There would have been fights  and scuffles.""    Clinic officials also criticized the police for preventing 10 of the chain's  security guards from opening a path that would have allowed clinic personnel  and clients to pass through protesters who were blocking doorways when clinic  personnel arrived at 7:30 a.m.    Sobel said the police had threatened to arrest the security guards, who have  been trained to open access to clinics under siege by ""jostling"" through the  crowd.    ""We felt the response was not only inadequate but the hostility to the property  owner was inexplicable and indefensible,"" she said. ""They made the Planning  Associates personnel into the criminals.""    Thompson denies threatening the security guards with arrest, but admits to  preventing them from entering the crowds. He said he was operating on the  advice of ""a number"" of police departments who had warned him of a potential  for fisticuffs.    ""One of our goals is to keep a business operating, but I'm also sworn to keep  the peace, and mixing those two groups together isn't doing that,"" he said. ""I  was trying to minimize violence.""      Pressing Charges    He said the main reason that police took so long to clear protesters was the  reluctance on the part of local clinic personnel to press charges.    ""The people at the clinic said they didn't want to make arrests -- that they  wanted to wait for their people from Long Beach to come up and press charges,""  he said.    Officials with the chain of 28 clinics admitted requesting a hold on arrests  until their arrival at 10:15 a.m., but faulted the police for not clearing  protesters shortly thereafter.    Sobel acknowledged that clinics generally are loathe to press charges against  protesters because ""Operation Rescue views getting arrested as a badge of  honor, and we don't see anything honorable in what they're doing.""      ACLU Criticized    Don Coleman, an assistant district attorney contacted by the ACLU during the  protest, stood behind the Ventura Police Department, saying that he ""questioned  whether the ACLU is being reasonable. I presume they wanted people picked up  and thrown aside.""    Thompson said Tuesday that he had met with an official from Ventura's Planned  Parenthood, which operates two clinics offering abortions in the county, to  discuss strategy for any future protests and is eager to meet with Family  Planning officials, but they had not returned a call placed Friday.    Joanne Moore, director of Ventura County services for Planned Parenthood,  expressed satisfaction with the meeting.    ""If there were a blockade, I would expect the Ventura Police Department to  respond appropriately and I have no reason to believe that they wouldn't,"" she  said. However, she noted that a four-hour delay in the opening of one of her  clinics would be unacceptable.      'Violence of Another Sort'    Anything that jeopardizes a patient's right to medical care ""is not right,"" she  said. ""That smacks of violence of another sort.""    In a six-month spate of Operation Rescue protests surrounding the recent  Supreme Court ruling on abortion, all but Ventura and two other Southern  California clinics have been able to keep their doors open, said Sobel.    The other occasions came on a single day in February when 500 Operation Rescue  activists demonstrated at separate clinics throughout Los Angeles.    Los Angeles City Council members later successfully pressed police Chief Daryl  F. Gates for assurances that protesters with Operation Rescue would be arrested  when they disrupt business at abortion clinics.      Actions Elsewhere    Many clinics have been able to keep their doors open by cooperating with police  and pro-choice forces. Security guards have been used effectively to preserve  access to clinics under siege on other occasions, Sobel said.    In Inglewood, security guards lifted clients over rows of protesters blocking  doorways, said Michael Monji, the chain's associate administrator.    On other occasions, police have taken a more active role. At a March protest in  Cypress, police officers protected a back entrance to a clinic that had been  surrounded by 600 protesters, said the office manager of Cypress Family  Planning Associates Medical Group.    ""The police have been very cooperative all along,"" said the Cypress employee,  who declined to give her name.

Officials with the chain of 28 clinics admitted requesting a hold on arrests  until their arrival at 10:15 a.m., but faulted the police for not clearing  protesters shortly thereafter.    Sobel acknowledged that clinics generally are loathe to press charges against  protesters because ""Operation Rescue views getting arrested as a badge of  honor, and we don't see anything honorable in what they're doing.""      ACLU Criticized    Don Coleman, an assistant district attorney contacted by the ACLU during the  protest, stood behind the Ventura Police Department, saying that he ""questioned  whether the ACLU is being reasonable. I presume they wanted people picked up  and thrown aside.""    Thompson said Tuesday that he had met with an official from Ventura's Planned  Parenthood, which operates two clinics offering abortions in the county, to  discuss strategy for any future protests and is eager to meet with Family  Planning officials, but they had not returned a call placed Friday.    Joanne Moore, director of Ventura County services for Planned Parenthood,  expressed satisfaction with the meeting.    ""If there were a blockade, I would expect the Ventura Police Department to  respond appropriately and I have no reason to believe that they wouldn't,"" she  said. However, she noted that a four-hour delay in the opening of one of her  clinics would be unacceptable.      'Violence of Another Sort'    Anything that jeopardizes a patient's right to medical care ""is not right,"" she  said. ""That smacks of violence of another sort.""    In a six-month spate of Operation Rescue protests surrounding the recent  Supreme Court ruling on abortion, all but Ventura and two other Southern  California clinics have been able to keep their doors open, said Sobel.    The other occasions came on a single day in February when 500 Operation Rescue  activists demonstrated at separate clinics throughout Los Angeles.    Los Angeles City Council members later successfully pressed police Chief Daryl  F. Gates for assurances that protesters with Operation Rescue would be arrested  when they disrupt business at abortion clinics.      Actions Elsewhere    Many clinics have been able to keep their doors open by cooperating with police  and pro-choice forces. Security guards have been used effectively to preserve  access to clinics under siege on other occasions, Sobel said.    In Inglewood, security guards lifted clients over rows of protesters blocking  doorways, said Michael Monji, the chain's associate administrator.    On other occasions, police have taken a more active role. At a March protest in  Cypress, police officers protected a back entrance to a clinic that had been  surrounded by 600 protesters, said the office manager of Cypress Family  Planning Associates Medical Group.    ""The police have been very cooperative all along,"" said the Cypress employee,  who declined to give her name.

The measure to mobilize an undetermined number of soldiers  was adopted this morning by the military garrison in Anzoategui  State, following the governor's request this morning to Garrison  Commander Miguel Aparicio Ramirez.    Police had been literally ""run over"" the past few days by  angry mobs and had been unable to prevent vandalism, which left  many supermarkets looted and several vehicles ablaze. Up until  now the authorities have not disclosed whether any arrests have  been made.    Violence unleashed by a group calling itself ""Red Flag""  [bureau records show this organization was founded in 1970 by  Carlos Betancourt] had paralyzed activities in Barcelona,  capital of Anzoategui State, for about a week. Disturbances  also reached the nearby beach resort of Puerto la Cruz.    Even though both Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz woke up in  complete calm today, it was a tense calm because of the presence  of National Guardsmen patrolling the streets.    Meanwhile, transportation services, which had been  temporarily suspended, have been totally reestablished, allowing  students and workers to meet their obligations, the local  VENPRES wire service reported. Likewise, many businessmen  opened their stores.    Anzoategui Governor Ovidio Gonzalez gave assurances that the  situation had been normalized in the northern part of the state,  even though he would not admit that Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz  are ""militarized.""

In a statement, the IFP condemned ""the arrest of three  prominent IFP leaders"", describing the police action as a  ""transparent attempt to placate the African National Congress  leadership"".

Nonetheless,  it does mark the return to normalized French-Chinese relations,  and leaves room for hope that some major contracts might be  wrapped up this summer.    By making an official visit to Beijing and Shanghai, the  prime minister knew he was indulging in a perilous undertaking.  The aim was to give official confirmation of French-Chinese  reconciliation and to create a political environment that might  benefit French companies, without ceding any ground regarding  the respecting of human rights. Beijing's determination to  press home its ""different"" point of view, compared with values  which it deems overly Western and, in fact, dangerous for a  state that is deeply divided, put an end to this hope.    The return to calm which Edouard Balladur was praying for  turned into an actual escalation of the situation when two  dissidents were arrested in Beijing and three more were detained  in Shanghai. Called upon to explain themselves, the Chinese  authorities minced their words and duly denied that the arrests  had taken place. And on Sunday morning, after Edouard Balladur  had left, one of the ""non- arrested"" dissidents was released,  only to be placed under close surveillance in Shanghai.  Diplomats unconvincingly pointed out that the Chinese often  resort to this system of arrests to coincide with official  visits by foreign leaders. However, the damage had been done.  The French prime minister who had repeatedly emphasized that  success in this area would depend on discretion and a lack of  publicity could only watch as he fell into the trap that he had  thought he could avoid. The same trap into which U.S. Foreign  Secretary Warren Christopher had stumbled more cruelly in  mid-March. By openly linking human rights with most-favored  nation status, he ran up against a wall of rejection deemed to  have dealt the United States a stinging blow. In fact, it has  pushed Washington to the point today of looking into the details  of a most-favored nation clause that would apply solely to U.S.  private companies or investments in China.    Upcoming Economic Tests    Today, France is avoiding any such contortions. However,  even if the results of economic reconciliation are confirmed  over the coming months, any such rapprochement will now be  politically tainted. And the international authority that  Edouard Balladur might have hoped to gain from his trip to China  will have been considerably lessened. It remains to be seen  whether the Chinese leaders are ready to prove concretely that  any link between human rights and business is, as they like  putting it, as outdated as the Cold War. If this is the case,  then the minor advances made during Edouard Balladur's visit in  cultural and economic terms will not have been made in vain.    In a country where the French language occupies a marginal  position, the opening of a pedagogical cultural center in  Beijing is not of negligible importance. The promise to create  a post dedicated to economic expansion in Canton, where the  consulate was closed as a punishment for French sales of Mirage  2000-5 aircraft to Taiwan, should enable France to start off on  the best footing again. At the same time, France has  non-negligible chances of being ""awarded"" the contract for a  second nuclear power station in Daya Bay, for reasons of  ""loyalty."" Which is music to the ears of Framatome, the French  manufacturer of nuclear reactors, which completed Daya Bay I  last year, together with Spie Batignolles.    And without harboring overly high hopes of a 2,500-km TGV  [high- speed train] link between Beijing and Shanghai actually  going ahead, the Chinese leaders have placed too great an  emphasis on the common interests of both countries in this  respect to abandon all hope regarding the results of the  electricity minister's next visit to Paris, or the mission that  Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet will lead in  the early summer. Only then will we be able to assess how  successful the trip by the French prime minister really was.  And know how far Paris is prepared to go to support new  contracts thanks to the financial protocol which has to be  completed by that time. Leaving aside the Daya Bay II project,  valued at something like 15 billion francs, or the Elf refinery  due to be built near Shanghai.    On the other hand, if Beijing continues to make an indirect  link between human rights and economic dossiers in an attempt to  raise the stakes, then we might well wonder about the  significance of the invitation to visit France which Edouard  Balladur confirmed to President Jiang Zemin, on behalf of  Francois Mitterrand. One thing is certain. France cannot  implement any Asian policy that does not take China into  account. Obviously, if Beijing wants to avoid confining itself  to two dialogue partners (the United States and Japan), but also  seeks to play Europe, then it simply must have the French card  at its disposal. However, what was supposed to mark a new phase  in French-Chinese relations could take on all the allure of a  long, hard march...unless a shift in French foreign policy is  confirmed, and the defense of human rights is openly uncoupled  from diplomatic and strategic imperatives.

The police made the arrests with the SFO's investigation only half completed, and the decision to move yesterday took place against a background of mounting pressure for action and intensifying press coverage. More than Pounds 900m remains missing from a variety of Maxwell companies and pension funds affecting thousands of Maxwell pensioners. The three men face a total of 15 charges of conspiracy to defraud and theft involving Pounds 135m. Mr Kevin Maxwell, at 33 the youngest Maxwell son, and a former chairman of Maxwell Communication Corporation, was charged with two counts of conspiracy to defraud and six of theft. The charges include the alleged defrauding of the Swiss Bank Corporation of Pounds 55m and the Swiss Volks Bank of Dollars 35m. Mr Trachtenberg, the 39-year-old former London School of Economics lecturer and financial adviser to the late publisher, was charged with two counts of conspiracy to defraud SBC and Volks Bank and four theft charges. Mr Ian Maxwell, the former Mirror Group Newspapers' chairman, was charged on a single count of conspiracy to defraud Volks Bank of Dollars 35m. The charges relate to only three of the five areas of inquiry still being pursued by the SFO, and all but one of the alleged offences are said to have taken place after Maxwell's death. The five lines of inquiry are into the circumstances surrounding a Pounds 55m loan from Swiss Bank Corporation, the MCC pension funds, money missing from MGN, an alleged share support operation and cash and investments removed from MCC. Accountants tracing Maxwell assets on behalf of creditors and pensioners said yesterday that the charges against the three men would have no effect on their investigations. Following the arrests, the three men were taken to Snow Hill police station in the City of London - not far from both the headquarters of the collapsed empire, and the offices used by the brothers recently in an apparent attempt to relaunch their business careers. They were brought to the police station just after 7am and were detained without being questioned before being charged. Reporting restrictions were not lifted on their first court appearance, lasting just over one hour at the City of London Magistrates, and all three were released on conditional bail to reappear on September 1. The trial  - likely to be the largest case of alleged fraud ever to come before the UK courts - is not expected to start for two years. Mr Kevin Maxwell was bailed on sureties of Pounds 500,000, Mr Ian Maxwell on sureties of Pounds 250,000 and Mr Trachtenberg on sureties of Pounds 300,000. In all cases, the sureties were provided by friends and family. All three were ordered to surrender their passports, not to leave the UK and to live at their home addresses. After the hearing Mr Kevin Maxwell said he would oppose all the charges against him. 'After seven months of trial by rumour, of trial by innuendo, of trial by selective press leaks and of prejudicial media reporting, I am really looking forward to being able to defend myself in a court of law where I intend to vigorously and strenuously contest all and any charges against me,' he said. The arrest of Mr Kevin Maxwell began in something close to farce. When two police officers rang the doorbell of his Pounds 1.7m house in Jubilee Place, Chelsea, his wife Pandora mistook them for reporters. She opened an upstairs window and shouted to the officers: 'Piss off - we don't get up for another hour.' When the officers rang the bell again she called out: 'I'm about to call the police'. They replied: 'We are the police, madam. Would you please open the door?'

According to a release by the Ankara-based International  Affairs Agency (IAA) Yeoryiadhis was behind bomb attacks in  tourist areas in Turkey last year and also the attempted murder  of Turkish general Dorgan Gures in 1992.    Yeoryiadhis was shot and killed outside his home last month  by a passing motorcyclist, believed to be a Turkish agent. No  arrests have been made.    Fellow member of the Kurdistan Solidarity Committee, Lakis  Pingouras yesterday denied Theofilos' involvement with the  alleged crimes. ""Our committee offers political support to the  national movement of the Kurds, nothing more and nothing less,""  he said.    The committee, which promotes the Kurdish issue to European  bodies, is similar to bodies in other countries which count MP's  among their members. ""We offer nothing other than political  support,"" he said.    Pingouras said the IAA follows the local press and brands  anybody concerned with the Cyprus or Kurdish problem a terrorist.    A branch of the IAA has recently been set up in occupied  Nicosia. According to their latest report Yeoryiadhis was a  self-confessed agent of the island's Greek intelligence services.    The report said the plot to kill General Gures two years  ago,  by putting poison in his coffee, was hatched in the free areas.  Yeoryiadhis, the agency reported, had admitted on a TV chat show  he was involved in the plan.    It also alleged that bombs against tourist targets in Turkey  were designed by the Solidarity Committee.     "

New ways of fighting the ever-increasing drugs problem were  discussed at the start of a three-day European Union conference  on illegal drugs, held at Zappion Hall, Central Athens.    The opening day seminar was on drug-addicts and prisons.    Addressing representatives from all over Europe, European  Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos said the production and  trafficking of hard drugs was an increasingly serious problem  for Greece's neighbours. Mr. Pangalos joined in wide-spread  allegations that The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  [FYROM] produces heroin.    ""New networks of producing and processing drugs, heroin in  particular, have developed in some countries that used to have a  communist regime,"" he said. ""Information is there, easy to be  proved,"" he added, pointing at records of arrests that Greek  authorities have had at their disposal during the last few years.    Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis said that Greek law  punishes drug traffickers but was unfair in how it treated drug  addicts. He did not rule out the possibility of a future  amendment to the law. ""The issue of people taking drugs and the  way of facing them remains open,"" said Mr. Kouvelakis.    According to data presented by Manolis Skoulakis, deputy  health minister, over half the people detained in Greek prisons  are on drugs. Mr. Skoulakis said that medical staff will soon  be hired by all Greek jails in order to tackle the problem: ""A  model unit for the psychological rehabilitation of drug addicts  will be founded in Khalkidhiki, in the near future."" He added  that ""the purpose of the project, costing one billion drachmas,  will be to face the needs of drug-dependent prisoners,""  stressing that it will function on a voluntary basis.     "

0,FT942-6193 ,"FT942-6193 _AN-EFAEIAB1FT 940601   FT  01 JUN 94 / Chaos feared from tighter air cargo checks      By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent   Security regulations on the shipment of air cargo which take effect today could delay exports and cause chaos at airports, a large freight-forwarding company claims. Only one in eight of cargo agents is thought to be able to meet the new rules. New security rules have been brought in partly in response to the bombing of a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie. They require the registration of air cargo agents with the threat of delays for shipments sent by unapproved companies. MSAS Cargo International, the second-largest UK freight forwarder, said that confusion about the new regulations had meant that many agents and airlines had not yet invested in the x-ray equipment which would be needed, nor had they trained their staff to hand-search cargo. MSAS also said shippers faced the prospect of additional charges to carry out cargo screening. The Aviation and Security (Air Cargo Agents) Regulations, which were brought in after three years of consultation with the industry, establish the concept of 'listed agents', who are approved and registered by the Department of Transport. Listed agents can in turn declare shippers to be 'known customers' if they are reputable, regular exporters which operate from secure sites. Cargo sent by known customers and listed agents can be shipped without stringent security checks, but other cargoes must be x-rayed or hand-searched. If this is not possible then the cargo must be held for the duration of the planned flight, plus two hours, but with a minimum wait of 12 hours. Mail and courier parcels which are less than  1/4 inch thick are exempt. The Department of Transport said the June deadline had been known since last September. It also said that about 110 of an estimated 800 agents have achieved listed status, and more were applying.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

As you know, Abdoulaye  Wade, secretary general of the Senegalese Democratic Party  [PDS], and Landing Savane, the leader of the African Party for  Democracy and Socialism, were arrested after the violent  demonstrations which caused the death of seven people in Dakar.  It has been announced in the Senegalese capital that other  arrests may be carried out. The two men are being questioned  separately by investigators. President Abdou Diouf's government  is blaming them for the violent incidents. However, Ousmane  Ngom, the PDS' number two man, told Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou  that Wade and Savane are being detained under restrictive  conditions.    [Begin Ngom recording] Mr. Wade has been totally isolated.  He cannot communicate with anybody. He has not been allowed to  communicate with his wife or his lawyers. He is also not  allowed to read newspapers or listen to the radio and has  therefore been totally deprived of information. We have been  informed that Mr. Savane is being subjected to the same  treatment. He is being detained under totally unacceptable  conditions, in violation of human rights and the most  fundamental freedom. Not only is this arrest arbitrary, it  appears to be more like a kidnapping because it is difficult to  understand how a deputy can be arrested without summons or a  warrant. Also it is difficult to see how the Senegalese  Government has still not given any reasons for the arrests. We  are therefore asking for the immediate removal of these  restrictive conditions as well as the immediate and  unconditional release of Wade, Savane, and all the other people  who were unjustly arrested with them.

On their trip to  the victims of Turkish terror in Kurdistan, they were  accompanied by two journalists from the daily OZGUR GUNDEM. The  Germans are now safe again, as opposed to their comrades.    Monika Hoehn talked to OZGUR GUNDEM journalist Mehetsah  Yildiz, one of her colleagues, following their release.    [Hoehn] What sort of reprisals are you subject to in your  work as a journalist?    [Yildiz] Our newspaper and its employees are constantly  subjected to reprisals. So far, nine employees have been  arrested. Some of my colleagues were imprisoned for three and  sometimes four months and tortured in prison -- even though  there was no evidence of guilt on their part. We are persecuted  because we are against the war and report on the war  objectively. The Turkish Government and its security forces do  not want to let us investigate and work in peace. There is no  freedom of the press of any kind. After the threat, I went from  Batman to Diyarbakir. Nothing happened there until I was  arrested with you.    There is no doubt that our life is in danger. However, there  is a standard for correspondents -- namely, to tell the truth --  and we are doing this work by risking our life. We do this for  our people who are tortured and massacred, and who live in  misery.    [Hoehn] You said torture is an everyday occurrence, and that  you live with it. How is this possible in a country described  by Prime Minister Ciller as a pioneer of democracy and human  rights?    [Yildiz] Every day 30 soldiers and a few guerillas and  civilians are shot dead. Nevertheless, Mrs. Ciller says there  are only a few terrorist actions and there is no war. There is  a war of intimidation underway, and murders are committed by  unknown perpetrators. There are 200 arrests every day. They  all take place under the aegis of the state of emergency. One  must ask why these people are killed. There is a war between  the Turkish Army and the Kurdish people.    [Hoehn] What personal reprisals have you suffered?    [Yildiz] In Izmir I was arrested by the police because of an  investigation. Some time later, the police broke into my  apartment again. On 1 May, I was arrested again and spent three  months in prison. Then I went to Batman. On 12 September 1993,  around 2230 -- we were sleeping in our office -- a bomb was  thrown into our office. One minute later the police chief and  his deputy were there. They lined us up against the wall and  asked us why we wanted to blow up our office. Then the deputy  of the political police beat me, held a gun to my head, and said  we should get lost or they would kill us.    They stole my money (6 million Turkish lira) and the  electrical equipment. The same night, they took me to the  ""Antiterrorism"" Department of the Political Police. They  tortured me and my colleague for three days.    The torture consists of having your arms tied behind your  back and being pulled up with a rope or a chain until your arms  slide out of their sockets and you faints. You are brought back  to consciousness with electrical charges to your feet or  genitalia. All in all, we were in prison for 10 days before we  were finally taken to a judge. In order to hide the evidence of  torture, they washed us and treated us with ointments every day.  And there were constant threats: ""Get out of here, or we will  kill you.""    Then we were taken to court. When it turned out that we were  innocent, we were released.    When I was released, I went to the Human Rights Foundation  in  Izmir. This is not a state institution, but a medical  institution. They said I should not move my arms for six months  and that I would bear the traces of torture for a long time. I  still have scars below the shoulder blades. Sometimes I cannot  even remember the names of my two children.    [Hoehn] Mehmetsah, do you have hopes and wishes that I could  tell my fellow-citizens?    [Yildiz] We would like to stress, above all, that we are  journalists and not armed militants. Nevertheless, the state  harasses and tortures us. In 1993 at least 10 persons were  killed as a result of torture. When Mrs. Ciller claims this is  Turkish democracy, then it ought to be possible to invite  investigations and international observers. Abuses in torture  chambers are an effort to destroy people's personality and to  plant crimes on them. In Kurdistan there is practically no one  left who has not been tortured at least once. If Mrs. Ciller  claims we have democracy here, then I am against this democracy.  It is good when foreign observer delegations come here, because  they have the opportunity to report torture and reprisals. It  is our hope that the world public will not keep silent about the  genocide and reprisals of the Turkish state against the Kurdish  people. We want the world public to become sensitized to what  is really going on here.     "

According to reliable sources, the delegation which had been  sent by Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar to explore  avenues for finding a lasting solution to the Afghan imbroglio,  could not meet Mowlawi Yunus Khales and Mowlawi Nabi Mohammad,  chief of his own faction of Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of  Afghanistan] and Herakat-e Enqelab-e [Islamic Revolution  Movement], respectively, on Friday [21 Jan] and Saturday [22  Jan] due to some unknown reasons.

Mr Sidki, 63, was unscathed. Jihad, an extremist Islamic group, immediately claimed responsibility. The bombing was to 'avenge the blood of the martyrs', a reference to Jihad members killed by security forces or sentenced to death in recent trials. The attack is the third failed assassination attempt on an Egyptian minister in eight months. Mr Safwat al-Sherif, information minister, survived a shooting near his home in April, while Mr Hassan al-Alfi, interior minister, was injured when a bomb exploded near his motorcade in central Cairo in mid-August, an attack also claimed by Jihad. Six cars parked 800 metres from the prime minister's home were damaged by the blast; one, presumed to have contained the bomb, was destroyed. Mr Sikdi, on TV a few hours after the attack, warned the government would toughen its clampdown on Islamic extremists. 'We are going to control this by all feasible, and any other means,' he said. Eight members of Jihad, which its members claim is a revival of the group which assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981, were sentenced to death on terrorist charges last month. Nearly 40 extremists have been condemned to death since the government introduced special military courts earlier this year, and 18 have been hanged. The government's security operations have led to an abatement in attacks on tourist targets and bombings in the Egyptian capital, although tit-for-tat killings of Moslem extremists and police have persisted in in Upper Egypt. Since last year 210 people have died in extremist violence. Another 400 alleged members of Jihad are scheduled for trial, facing possible death sentences, in the next few months.

A gunman shot dead embassy first secretary Na'ib 'Umran  al-Ma'aiytah outside his Beirut home on Saturday and seized  documents from his briefcase.    He was the first diplomat to be killed in Lebanon since the  end of the 15-year civil war in 1990.    No group has claimed responsibility for the murder, which  Jordan blamed on opponents of the Middle East peace process.    ""Witnesses have given the security services a description of  the killers,"" Mirhij told AFP. ""This information could lead to  their arrest,"" he said.    ""Some witnesses also revealed that the killer seized a file  from the Jordanian diplomat's car,"" he added.    According to the latest police report, al-Ma'aiytah, a  42-year-old father of three, was killed when a gunman pumped 10  bullets into his neck, head and chest as he sat in his Mercedes.    The killer then fled in another car with an accomplice.    Jordanian Foreign Ministry officials, citing Lebanese  police,  reported on Sunday that a file which al-Ma'aiytah had at the  time of his killing had disappeared.    Jordan's ambassador in Lebanon, Fakhri Abu-Talib, said ""the  murder was planned and carried out by professionals and it could  have taken place in any other country.""    The killing came almost a week after Jordan's King Husayn  said in Washington that he hoped to meet Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin to boost the chances for peace.    Several Palestinian and Lebanese groups opposed to the peace  process, including pro-Iranian and pro-Syrian factions, are  based in Beirut.     "

It appears they have  become familiar with the situation and are nonchalant despite  the bomb attacks recently made on the residences of the Interior  Minister and an opposition party leader. An attack made  recently on a locomotive traveling on the southern rail line  only succeeded in terrorizing the train crew.    The people of the South have now become so familiar with the  bombings that as opposed to feeling that they are living in the  shadow of fear it is quite to the contrary. If there were no  bombings it would be beyond the realms of normality.    Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut seems unperturbed  by the bomb attack directed at his home, saying he would not  allow the attacks to intimidate him wherever they may occur.    Despite this statement, the bombings are a genuine cause of  concern for Chuan Likphai's coalition government. No matter  what group is responsible for the attacks, if they are allowed  to continue unabated, they are bound to undermine the confidence  of the people in the government's ability to maintain law and  order.    If apathy is allowed to set in, when considering the  attitudes of the citizens of the country and the government to  the bombings, there would seem to be little hope of locating  those responsible and stamping out the attacks for good.    One confounding factor in the bombing issue is that the  identity of the group responsible for the attacks is unknown and  no demands have been made. At this time the attacks would seem  to be pointless.    It is possible that Gen Chawalit believes he has received  up-to- date information from his advisers on the issue but there  is one point he may have failed to consider.    The group responsible for the bombings may be politically  motivated with an ultimate intention of causing political chaos  and disruption in the nation. Recent reports that foreign  terrorist groups planned to attack the Israeli embassy in  Bangkok were probably unconnected to the bombing incidents that  have already been carried out in the capital, as attacks on  local politician's homes are unlikely to gain anything for  Middle Eastern terrorist groups, who would seem to be the most  likely perpetrators of any such attack on the embassy.    Let's consider the probable intentions of the group  responsible for the bombings:    A desire for political chaos and to create disruption in the  country, and to make the government appear to be unfit to carry  out the task to which it was elected because it is unable to  maintain stability.    To increase pressure on the government at a time when  parliament is in disarray with an intention of making it look  incompetent in the eyes of the general public. It is possible  this could lead to the dissolution of parliament.    Prior political forces in the country might be able to  return  to power in this way. If the government is left alone to carry  out its duties unhindered, the chances of any forces of the past  returning to power would diminish.    Some observers say the planting of the bombs can clearly be  seen as the dying throes of a spent political force but these  are few and far between.    They can be narrowed down into two categories -- democratic  and dictatorial.    Democratic political parties, or those who profess to be,  come in several forms. Power swings to and fro depending on the  opinions of the electorate during general elections.    Before the formation of the National Peace Keeping Council  (NPKC), the Chatchai administration maintained a grip on power.    Coming from self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom to  successfully defend himself against allegations of corruption,  former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan's Chat Thai Party  failed to get reelected in the last general election. Chat Thai  have now been relegated to assume the role of opposition party,  but are eagerly waiting in the wings for a final banana skin to  bring down the government for good. All the opposition parties  will have an opportunity to return to power, courtesy of the  democracy system which necessitates the holding of free general  elections.    Political parties have no need to carry out terrorist acts  to  pressure the government. Their use of criticism during  parliamentary sessions is usually adequate.    Opposition parties are unlikely candidates for the  suspicions  of those investigating the bombings.    Dictators who have fallen from the privileged position of  political power are the most deserving for the focus of  suspicion as they have the most to gain.    With the democracy system now firmly in place they are  unlikely to be voted back into power by the electorate and their  only route would seem to be one of violence with an aim of  creating chaos -- an atmosphere in which they might be able to  seize power again.    It is imperative, however, that the government quickly trace  those responsible for the attacks if they wish to maintain an  impression of competence.    The right-wing group of Gen Thanom Kittikhachon would be a  good place to begin investigations although some observers have  said that these groups are incapable of carrying out the attacks.    Does Gen Chawalit know who the culprits are?     "

Two-fifths also favour excluding cars from certain City areas which may be at high risk, at a time when pressure is growing on the government to find new ways to tighten security to prevent future IRA attacks. Nearly two-thirds said they would be 'very' or 'fairly likely' to contribute to increased policing costs related to preventing terrorism, while 31 per cent agreed businesses in high-risk areas should pay an extra premium for terrorist cover. The poll was based on interviews this week with representatives - many with top executives - of 103 leading City banks, professional firms and regulators. Forty-seven per cent said they 'strongly agreed' or 'tended to agree' that London would lose its position as Europe's premier financial centre if the bombing campaign continued. But none of the 12 non-UK banks questioned said it was likely to reduce operations in London because of the risk of further bombs. Two said it was 'not very likely' and 10 'not at all likely'. Mr Paul Downes, deputy chief executive of Georgeson, a public relations company, said: 'I don't think anybody is going to be put off for ever. It is not going suddenly to cause them to switch location. But it makes people nervous.' Thirty-nine per cent of the organisations surveyed were damaged by the blast, with 15 per cent describing the effect as 'substantial'. More than a quarter said that some employees were not able to work on the Monday after the Saturday bombing. Fifteen per cent said none of their workforce was able to work even by Wednesday.

Turkish military sources, quoted by the official Anatolian news agency, confirmed that bombing sorties were made early in the day against two alleged PKK targets up to 18 miles inside Iraq near the Iranian border. Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, warned this week that Turkey would seal the 170-mile border with Iraq to prevent incursions by the PKK, which is fighting for a separate Kurdish state in southern Turkey. The raids yesterday mark a heightening in the conflict and coincide with the worst civil unrest in the eight-year Kurdish troubles. In further clashes in Turkey, six people were killed including two pro-government village militia near Diyarbakir, the provincial capital in the south-eastern region. Two policemen were shot in separate incidents in Adana, southern Turkey, and Ankara, the Turkish capital. Tanks and armoured personnel carriers were still deployed in a string of towns near the Syrian and Iraqi borders after clashes between security forces and demonstrators at the weekend left up to 60 people dead. The Turkish government is to send a four-man delegation to the border area today to investigate the unrest. However Mr Demirel's coalition is under pressure from both the army and conservatives in his True Path party to continue to take a hard line against the PKK. Politicians of the Turkish Labour Party (HEP) were said to be ready to withdraw from the coalition because of the government's failure to fulfil promises of human rights reform. Support from the 22 Kurdish HEP members was central to Mr Demirel's earlier promise of reforms aimed at winning over the Kurds.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Citing sources close to Dincote, the Lima press reports that  Dincote troops have seized powerful radio transmitters and  modern communications equipment used by MRTA leaders in Trujillo  to communicate with their subordinates in the tropical forest  region of Upper Huallaga.    This operation, which took place some days ago and  culminated  with the raid on the center, is another harsh blow to the MRTA.  The terrorist group received yet another setback this past week  in the same northern city -- the capital of La Libertad  Department -- when six MRTA leaders, including an Italian woman,  were arrested.    The sources state that the communications center was  frequently visited by Nestor Serpa Cartolini, alias ""Evaristo,""  the current top MRTA leader following the arrest of Victor Polay  in May 1992.    Serpa apparently just missed being captured -- he was at the  communications center just before the operation was mounted. No  arrests were made during the raid.    The Dincote report states that one of the two vehicles  seized  when the six MRTA members were caught belongs to Serpa.    Lima EL COMERCIO today reports that the Italian citizen -- a  member of the MRTA who lived with a terrorist called ""Perseo"" --  has been identified as Maria Gabriela Geronino or Gabriela  Guarino, allegedly a journalist.    In another operation, four Shining Path members were  captured  in the Province of Cajabamba, in the northern department of  Cajamarca.    The sources report that the MRTA has been practically mopped  up, although there are still some scattered pockets that Serpa  is trying to reorganize.     "

Although the Administration promised only to give a yes or no answer promptly  to visa requests, a State Department official said that, in practice, a high  percentage of the requests probably will be granted to allow Chinese to escape  the government crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.    At the same time, pressure was building on Capitol Hill to impose additional  economic sanctions on China in response to the regime's sweeping arrests of  democracy demonstrators. The chairmen of the Asia subcommittees in the Senate  and House, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.),  issued separate calls for further action against the Beijing government.    ""I would favor immediately dropping the People's Republic of China from the  list of countries getting most-favored-nation trade treatment, and I would  consider other steps in the future,"" Cranston said.    Solarz visited the State Department to urge additional sanctions. A spokesman  said Solarz argued ""that because of events in Beijing since the initial  crackdown, we need to do more than the President announced last week.""    President Bush suspended arms sales to China and halted U.S. military contacts  with the Chinese army after the June 4 massacre in and around Tian An Men  Square but he has taken no additional steps in response to the continuing  crackdown.    State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said long lines of Chinese  seeking visas have formed outside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and at consulates  in other cities. The visa sections in Beijing and Shanghai, the nation's  largest city, have been closed, but Tutwiler said they will reopen today. She  said the U.S. consulates in Canton, Shenyang and Chengdu are operating  normally.    However, Tutwiler said that normal operations may prove to be inadequate in the  face of the expected demand for temporary permission to come to the United  States.    ""We will be monitoring the requirements to assure that staffing levels are  adequate to provide the full range of consular services, including visa  issuances,"" she said. ""If it's above the normal load of visas, whatever it  takes to process visas"" will be done.    At issue are non-immigrant visas, usually granted to students, tourists and  business people. For Chinese citizens who have passports, the visa is all that  is needed in order to leave the country. They are approved at the discretion of  U.S. consular staff members after they state a valid reason for wanting to come  to this country.    In practice, however, only a relative handful of Chinese citizens hold  passports. A Chinese citizen can generally obtain a passport only for  government-approved travel abroad and often has to surrender it on return.  Thus, the State Department move is unlikely to make a significant difference in  the number of Chinese able to come to the United States, although it may help  some students with passports who previously had been denied U.S. visas on the  grounds that their true intent was to emigrate.      Extended Current Visas    The Justice Department last week extended all visas currently in effect because  of the unsettled situation in China. Officials said it is unlikely that any  Chinese already in the United States would be sent home until conditions in  China improve.    ""The detention or arrest of people for exercising their basic human rights of  freedom of expression and free association is contrary to internationally  recognized standards,"" Tutwiler said in the Administration's first direct  reaction to the wave of arrests by the Chinese government.    Tutwiler said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III received on Tuesday a  comprehensive list of possible options for new U.S. sanctions. But she said  that no immediate action is planned.    ""This is nothing more than a list of options, should a situation ever  materialize so that you would be ready, you would not have to spend the hours  that the people have spent to pull them together and collect all the  information,"" Tutwiler said. ""This is not something that has been sent to him  in the form of recommendations. . . . Which options he might or might not  choose, I don't know. He doesn't know.""      Most Americans Have Left    As a practical matter, most possible U.S. economic sanctions have already been  overrun by events. For instance, in recent years the U.S. government attempted  to put economic pressure on Libya by ordering U.S. business people to leave the  country. There is not much point in doing that in China because almost all  American citizens have already fled the country. Similarly, an embargo on new  U.S. investment in China would seem to be superfluous, at least for the time  being.    Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) told a breakfast meeting with a group of  reporters that ""business in China is pretty much dead"" so there is very little  left that would be affected by sanctions.

In a report published today, the human rights group said scores of people had been killed and many brutally tortured by the Kuwaiti armed forces and self-styled resistance groups since February 26. Most of those suffering persecutionhave been Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Iraq during its seven-month occupation. 'Victims have been gunned down in public or taken away, tortured and killed in secret,' Amnesty said. The organisation's fact-finding team reported that hundreds had been arrested and many people had apparently disappeared. Detainees said at least seven prisoners had died in custody after torture. 'These violations are continuing and appear to be largely unchecked,' Amnesty said. 'Their scale and persistence threaten to leave an indelible stain on Kuwait's human rights record. This is all the more lamentable in the light of hopes that the kind of violations that occurred under the Iraqi occupation would be a thing of the past.' Most abuses immediately after the defeat of Iraq were carried out by 'resistance' squads, Amnesty said, but armed forces personnel were cited in later cases. Torture methods included the use of electric shocks, burning with cigarettes and acid, biting and threats of execution and sexual assault. Amnesty withdrew allegations that the Iraqis had killed large numbers of premature babies by removing them from incubators, because of lack of evidence, but it said the overall picture of serious Iraqi human rights abuses during the occupation was correct.

The system was installed earlier this year after the success of a pilot scheme on a council-owned industrial estate, where crime had been discouraging businesses from moving in. Thirty six cameras are now located in car parks, housing estates and leisure and shopping centres. They are linked by fibre optic cables to a central control room which is staffed 24 hours a day and which has a direct link to the police station. Running the system costs Pounds 200,000 year in staff, maintenance and leasing costs. This is partly funded by a 5p surcharge on carpark tickets and service charges for businesses in areas covered by the scheme. The council claims it is the UK's first multi-application surveillance system which can be used for management of council facilities as well as crime prevention and security. The council is now considering expanding the service to businesses in the town on a commercial basis. The low-light cameras can be targeted on a particular place if there are signs of suspicious activity, and all pictures are recorded. The system has cut vandalism and reduced car thefts from three a fortnight to three over the six-month period since it was introduced. Police attribute 53 arrests directly to the cameras, and the borough council says people are no longer reluctant to use carparks in shopping centres because of car crime. It says that any public worries over 'big brother' surveillance have been offset by the benefits of having increased security.  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "

The request was put to Dr Ali Elhouderi, Libyan ambassador to the UN, who, according to the spokesman, had informed Mr Ghali of 'his government's willingness to hand over the accused persons'. In response, the UN chief sought written confirmation that handing the men over to the Arab League 'would be a first step in complying fully and unconditionally' with Security Council Resolution 731. This called for their surrender to British or US authorities seeking their extradition. An Arab League delegation, led by its secretary-general Mr Esmat Abdel-Maguid, flew to Tripoli yesterday to discuss with Libya the proposed handover to the 21-nation league. Libya made the offer after Arab League foreign ministers had offered only limited support for Libya in its confrontation with Britain, the US and France over its alleged role in the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, in Scotland, in 1988 and a UTA jet over Niger in 1989. However, details of any handover were unclear yesterday and earlier optimism at the United Nations gave way to a suspicion that, as one senior official put it, 'we're getting a runaround'. Sir David Hannay, British ambassador to the UN, said last night there was a high degree of uncertainty on the issue. 'The jury's out as far as I'm concerned,' he said. If there was no positive outcome, then 'we will want to move ahead rather quickly' on action in the Security Council. If outcome was negative, 'I don't think there will much further delay' on sanctions.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The new countywide guidelines take responsibility away from the victims, who  are often too afraid to press charges, and give it to law enforcement officials  to decide whether a case should be prosecuted.    ""It's a crime whether the victim wants it prosecuted or not,"" said Ashley  Walker-Hooper, co-chair of the San Diego County Task Force on Domestic  Violence.    In the past, some abusers have gone unchecked because incidents were not  reported by police or not prosecuted when victims refused to press charges,  said Casey Gwinn, supervisor of the Domestic Violence Unit for the city  attorney's office and another co-chair of the task force.    Women often decide not to press charges because they fear retaliation, don't  want to put their husband or boyfriend in jail for fear of losing their  financial support, or because they simply don't want to get involved,  authorities say.    Gwinn and law enforcement members of the task force developed a set of  guidelines, which they call a protocol, to be used uniformly throughout the  county. The goal is to treat a domestic violence case like any other crime: If  the evidence is there, prosecute.    For the abusers, getting caught can be the first step in stopping, say people  who work with battered women.    ""If they don't get arrested, they think they can get away with it,"" said  Carolyn Ford, shelter director for the YWCA's Battered Women's Services.    Last year, 15,417 cases of domestic violence were reported in San Diego County,  6,138 of those in San Diego, said Roni Brodeth, a researcher for the San Diego  Assn. of Governments.    The task force, representing about 100 agencies countywide, was set up in June,  1989, to combat escalating domestic violence.    Such violence includes abuse between husbands and wives, people who are dating  and people involved in homosexual relationships, Gwinn said. About 98% of the  abusers in domestic violence cases are men, he said.    The guidelines, announced last week, were unanimously approved earlier this  month by county law enforcement agencies, which will put them into practice  over the next 60 days.    Although arrests and prosecution in domestic violence cases are at the heart of  the task force's work, setting up standard procedures for emergency dispatchers  and officers who have initial contact with the victims have also been included.    There have been incidents in which 911 operators have not dispatched police as  quickly as they should have when a domestic-violence call for help came in, the  task force found.    ""We hear 911 tapes every day where we hear them say to the victim, 'Do you want  to press charges?' "" Gwinn said. ""That's a stupid question; it doesn't matter  if the victim wants to press charges.""    The new guidelines say that, like police, 911 operators must concentrate on  victim safety and not the legal future of the complaint.    ""Any comment or statement which seeks to place the responsibility for  enforcement action with the victim is inappropriate,"" the protocol says.    Gwinn cites a domestic violence case in Los Angeles to emphasize the  importantance of reacting quickly to spousal abuse calls.    About a year ago, a woman called 911 saying her husband was going to kill her.  The 911 dispatcher told her they couldn't send anyone out until the husband  showed up. About 25 minutes later, the man showed up and shot the woman to  death, along with three of her relatives.    ""911 should have told (her) to get out of the house, to go hide,"" Gwinn said.    The guidelines also set forth a ""pro-arrest policy,"" meaning that making an  arrest and taking a suspected offender to jail is the preferred action whenever  possible.    A checklist has been set up to help officers collect evidence and investigators  follow up.    Although many domestic violence arrests involve felonies, a vast majority of  the cases end up being prosecuted as misdemeanors to keep the courts from being  overloaded.    ""It would bury the court system,"" Gwinn said.    But he said prosecuting cases as misdemeanors has proven effective because it  gets the justice system involved. An offender will usually serve some time in  jail, go through a long-term counseling program and be required to do public  service work.    Domestic violence is also one of a handful of misdemeanors in which an offender  can be taken to jail.    Despite jail crowding, misdemeanor domestic violence suspects that warrant  jailing will continue to be booked into county jails because a court order  mandates it, said Assistant Sheriff Ken Wigginton, who is in charge of  detention services in the county. Felony suspects are automatically booked.    Domestic violence can be considered a felony if a victim suffers injuries that  require medical treatment and a misdemeanor if no treatment was necessary,  Gwinn said.    He said he is adamant about pursuing incidents of domestic violence more  aggressively, noting that of the 22 domestic violence homicides last year, all  involved prior misdemeanor incidents.    ""When somebody says it's just a misdemeanor, they don't know what they're  talking about,"" Gwinn said. ""It's a warning sign of a possible homicide.""    Law enforcers countywide are working out plans to implement the task force's  guidelines by circulating them to supervisors and officers and giving short  presentations.    ""The most important thing is that we'll all be doing it the same way,"" said  Cmdr. Myron Klippert of the county Sheriff's Department.

""It's a crime whether the victim wants it prosecuted or not,"" said Ashley  Walker-Hooper, co-chair of the San Diego County Task Force on Domestic  Violence.    In the past, some abusers have gone unchecked because incidents were not  reported by police or not prosecuted when victims refused to press charges,  said Casey Gwinn, supervisor of the Domestic Violence Unit for the city  attorney's office and another co-chair of the task force.    Women often decide not to press charges because they fear retaliation, don't  want to put their husband or boyfriend in jail for fear of losing their  financial support, or because they simply don't want to get involved,  authorities say.    Gwinn and law enforcement members of the task force developed a set of  guidelines, which they call a protocol, to be used uniformly throughout the  county. The goal is to treat a domestic violence case like any other crime: If  the evidence is there, prosecute.    For the abusers, getting caught can be the first step in stopping, say people  who work with battered women.    ""If they don't get arrested, they think they can get away with it,"" said  Carolyn Ford, shelter director for the YWCA's Battered Women's Services.    Last year, 15,417 cases of domestic violence were reported in San Diego County,  6,138 of those in San Diego, said Roni Brodeth, a researcher for the San Diego  Assn. of Governments.    The task force, representing about 100 agencies countywide, was set up in June,  1989, to combat escalating domestic violence.    Such violence includes abuse between husbands and wives, people who are dating  and people involved in homosexual relationships, Gwinn said. About 98% of the  abusers in domestic violence cases are men, he said.    The guidelines, announced last week, were unanimously approved earlier this  month by county law enforcement agencies, which will put them into practice  over the next 60 days.    Although arrests and prosecution in domestic violence cases are at the heart of  the task force's work, setting up standard procedures for emergency dispatchers  and officers who have initial contact with the victims have also been included.    There have been incidents in which 911 operators have not dispatched police as  quickly as they should have when a domestic-violence call for help came in, the  task force found.    ""We hear 911 tapes every day where we hear them say to the victim, 'Do you want  to press charges?' "" Gwinn said. ""That's a stupid question; it doesn't matter  if the victim wants to press charges.""    The new guidelines say that, like police, 911 operators must concentrate on  victim safety and not the legal future of the complaint.    ""Any comment or statement which seeks to place the responsibility for  enforcement action with the victim is inappropriate,"" the protocol says.    Gwinn cites a domestic violence case in Los Angeles to emphasize the  importantance of reacting quickly to spousal abuse calls.    About a year ago, a woman called 911 saying her husband was going to kill her.  The 911 dispatcher told her they couldn't send anyone out until the husband  showed up. About 25 minutes later, the man showed up and shot the woman to  death, along with three of her relatives.    ""911 should have told (her) to get out of the house, to go hide,"" Gwinn said.    The guidelines also set forth a ""pro-arrest policy,"" meaning that making an  arrest and taking a suspected offender to jail is the preferred action whenever  possible.    A checklist has been set up to help officers collect evidence and investigators  follow up.    Although many domestic violence arrests involve felonies, a vast majority of  the cases end up being prosecuted as misdemeanors to keep the courts from being  overloaded.    ""It would bury the court system,"" Gwinn said.    But he said prosecuting cases as misdemeanors has proven effective because it  gets the justice system involved. An offender will usually serve some time in  jail, go through a long-term counseling program and be required to do public  service work.    Domestic violence is also one of a handful of misdemeanors in which an offender  can be taken to jail.    Despite jail crowding, misdemeanor domestic violence suspects that warrant  jailing will continue to be booked into county jails because a court order  mandates it, said Assistant Sheriff Ken Wigginton, who is in charge of  detention services in the county. Felony suspects are automatically booked.    Domestic violence can be considered a felony if a victim suffers injuries that  require medical treatment and a misdemeanor if no treatment was necessary,  Gwinn said.    He said he is adamant about pursuing incidents of domestic violence more  aggressively, noting that of the 22 domestic violence homicides last year, all  involved prior misdemeanor incidents.    ""When somebody says it's just a misdemeanor, they don't know what they're  talking about,"" Gwinn said. ""It's a warning sign of a possible homicide.""    Law enforcers countywide are working out plans to implement the task force's  guidelines by circulating them to supervisors and officers and giving short  presentations.    ""The most important thing is that we'll all be doing it the same way,"" said  Cmdr. Myron Klippert of the county Sheriff's Department.    "

The measures, backed by the Home Office, will be put into operation this weekend. Police at the six main routes into the City will monitor and stop suspicious vehicles. Other entry roads will be blocked. The measures, due to stay in place for a year, are the first stage in a broader plan to be announced at the end of the week. Non-essential traffic would be restricted, and police and video camera surveillance increased. The moves will probably need parliamentary approval. Mr Owen Kelly, the commissioner of the City of London Police, met Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the Corporation of London's policy committee, yesterday to finalise details. Mr Cassidy said the area covered by the security ring would be 'considerably smaller' than the square mile, focusing on the Bank of England headquarters. The checkpoints would not act as road blocks and 'most people will probably notice no difference'. 'This is not a 'ring of steel' around the City,' he added. Against a background of concern that the measures might be seen as an IRA propaganda coup, the Corporation of London was at pains to play down the move. It pointed out that vehicle surveillance was already carried out in the City, after the Bishopsgate bombing two months ago. City businesses and banks gave the proposals a cautious welcome, although they emphasised that until the fuller set of proposals was in force, it would be impossible to predict the impact on the City's reputation. 'As long as emergency vehicle access was maintained, and the City was able to function as a financial institution, we would welcome the tightening of security,' the Stock Exchange said.

The article states that the City of London police force 'sometimes hasn't got cover at weekends'. This statement is entirely wrong. At all times the force area is covered by a significant number of operational police officers, both on foot patrol and in response cars, capable of dealing with any incident. Indeed, on the morning that the Bishopsgate bomb was discovered by police, the force immediately deployed officers to evacuate a very large area, thus reducing the number of casualties. In common with many other forces, the City of London Police has started setting target response times for attendance at incidents (which are graded in priority bands). This force sets very high targets (four minutes for the most urgent of incidents) and during the early months of this year a performance of almost 94 per cent was recorded across the full range of incidents. Over the past three years, the force has dealt with five bombing incidents in the City of London, and gained unrivalled experience in fighting urban terrorism. It takes a leading role in training on this subject at the police staff college at Bramshill. Because of the heightened risk of terrorism to the City of London, officers have been redeployed from the fraud squad and other specialist departments to undertake anti-terrorist duties. Our officers work closely in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police anti-terrorist branch, and at any given time we have up to 30 officers working with them. We feel that it is important that the citizens of the City of London are confident that their police provide a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week service, capable of meeting their needs.

0,FT921-15363 ,"FT921-15363 _AN-CAJARADQFT 920110   FT  10 JAN 92 / Worrying cracks in Belfast confidence: This week's bombs may have damaged more than just buildings      By TIM COONE   BUSINESS As Usual signs pasted over boarded-up shopfronts greet 1992 in Belfast's city centre. Shoppers glance upwards with curiosity at windowless office blocks as workmen scoop up piles of shattered glass with shovels from the pavement and rip out warped window frames with crowbars. The year started with two explosions in the heart of the city. Between them they are likely to cost the British taxpayer Pounds 10m in indemnity payments. The two IRA bombs which devastated two Inland Revenue buildings and damaged scores of shops, offices, restaurants and bars at the beginning of the week have created a scene reminiscent of the worst periods of the city's history. The manager of one large retail chain store said: 'It is amazing how people have not been put off by the bombs. Staff have come in, rolled up their sleeves and started the clean-up with a determination to get business back to normal as quickly as possible.' But behind the doughty resilience of this city's population, now accustomed to the tribulations caused by 22 years of IRA bomb damage, there is growing concern about the government's security policy and its response to the renewed IRA bombing campaign - which its leaders have warned will intensify this year. The area manager of Guardian Royal Exchange, whose offices were extensively damaged in Monday's blast, said: 'There is a feeling in the business community that the security forces could do a little bit better and that it is time to take the initiative and go after these guys.' Unionist leaders called this week for stricter security at Republican strongholds within the city. Criticism has been levelled at the army for withdrawing 500 troops just before Christmas. They were brought into the province one month earlier in response to the renewed campaign. That criticism is thought to be shared at senior levels within the Northern Ireland Office (NIO), the government body which is responsible for the administration of Ulster and foots the bills for the IRA attacks. Insurance companies stopped providing cover for bomb damage in the 1970s. Those bills have been rapidly mounting. Last December the NIO announced a moratorium until next April on capital spending in the province in order to meet the cost of clearing up after firebomb attacks. A bomb badly damaged the Europa hotel and the Grand Opera House in the city centre on December 4. The manager of a leading glazing firm in Belfast said: 'That bomb caused some Pounds 5m in damage, about 20 per cent of it in glass. 'What we are seeing is as bad as we had in the 1970s, although it was more continuous then.' In the 1990-91 fiscal year the NIO paid out Pounds 22.7m in indemnities for property damage in Northern Ireland. The damage from the bomb attacks in Belfast's city centre in the past month alone is unofficially estimated at Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m. Mr Richard Needham, the NIO's minister for economic development, remains optimistic. There is no intention to change the NIO's policy on indemnification, which amounts to an open-ended commitment. He views the bombing campaign as an opportunity to reconstruct Belfast's city centre. The issue of improvements has been one of the wrangles between businessmen and the NIO. Until now the NIO has been prepared to pay only the costs of restoring the damage, and not to pay for improvements. That may change soon. The process of compensation is slow, however. Joxor's bar and restaurant, just around the corner from the Europa hotel, has had its windows blown out three times in four weeks. Its owner says the total cost will come to about Pounds 20,000 and that on past experience it will probably take up to two years before the NIO compensation is paid in full. He smiled and said: 'The bank manger has been very sympathetic. He's had his windows blown out as well.' Close to Joxor's is Windsor House, the tallest office block in Ireland and home to the Inland Revenue as well as the European Commission in Northern Ireland and numerous private offices. The building, which houses about 1,000 workers, was extensively damaged in the earlier Sunday blast. Plywood eyes now stare out over the city where the windows once were. Piles of paper litter, blown off desks and out of filing cabinets, lie in sodden heaps on the pavement in the wintry rain. The general manager of the Europa, Mr Michael Williamson, said only 50 of the 200 rooms in the hotel were in use, one month after the Opera House bomb, and he thought it would be two to three months before the hotel was operating normally again. His compensation claim would 'probably be in excess of Pounds 1m'. In spite of the disruption there remains an air of determined optimism. Mr Williamson said: 'We are not going to let it force us out.' His view is seemingly shared by most businessmen in the city. Christmas trade was better than expected for most, and the NIO's indemnification policy allows tradesmen to view their reverses with a detached black humour. Nevertheless, should the bombing campaign continue, as threatened by the IRA, many businessmen fear there would be a decline in trade. They say intensified security checks, causing traffic congestion, often cause more disruption than the bombs. Mr Needham believes the IRA's latest campaign is an act of desperation and that the tide has turned against it. 'They cannot hope to win power as they once did, with the Armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other. Their support is falling. 'They are terrified of a schism in their ranks. If they give up what can they bargain with? Their alternative is to carry on with a policy knowing they cannot win.' Is Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, hoping to bomb its way to the negotiating table then? 'There is no possibility of that while they continue to support violence,' said Mr Needham. When asked about statements made this week by Mr Martin McGuinness, a Sinn Fein leader, who said that his party will 'make it as easy as possible' for the British government to open a path to the negotiating table, Mr Needham replied simply: 'We are living in interesting times.'

New ways of fighting the ever-increasing drugs problem were  discussed at the start of a three-day European Union [EU]  conference on illegal drugs, held at Zappion Hall, Central  Athens.    The opening day seminar was on drug-addicts and prisons.    Addressing representatives from all over Europe, European  Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos said the production and  trafficking of hard drugs was an increasingly serious problem  for Greece's neighbours. Mr. Pangalos joined in wide-spread  allegations that The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  produces heroin.    ""New networks of producing and processing drugs, heroin in  particular, have developed in some countries that used to have a  communist regime,"" he said. ""Information is there, easy to be  proved,"" he added, pointing at records of arrests that Greek  authorities have had at their disposal during the last few years.    Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis said that Greek law  punishes drug traffickers but was unfair in how it treated drug  addicts. He did not rule out the possibility of a future  amendment to the law. ""The issue of people taking drugs and the  way of facing them remains open,"" said Mr. Kouvelakis.    According to data presented by Manolis Skoulakis, deputy  health minister, over half the people detained in Greek prisons  are on drugs. Mr. Skoulakis said that medical staff will soon  be hired by all Greek jails in order to tackle the problem: ""A  model unit for the psychological rehabilitation of drug addicts  will be founded in Khalkidhiki, in the near future.""

The arrest of Jorge Roca-Suarez, 38, at his 19-room house was confirmed by  Julius C. Beretta, special agent in charge of the San Diego office of the U.S.  Drug Enforcement Administration. Agents also arrested Roca's wife, Beatriz  Roca-Torres, 40, in nearby Monterey Park, Beretta said.    Both were being held on charges of conspiracy to possess cocaine with the  intent to deliver, the agent said.    Beretta would divulge no more about the arrests or the charges against the  couple, saying only that Roca is a resident immigrant in this country and ""one  of the most significant cocaine traffickers in the United States, on par with a  Medellin or Cali cartel leaders.""    One law enforcement source said the arrests stem from a federal indictment that  is expected to be unsealed today. The source said the investigation rivals that  of former Panama strongman Manuel Noriega, who is jailed in Miami while  awaiting trial on drug charges.    Agents arrested Roca at his 5,000-square-foot brick home on a hillside in one  of San Marino's most exclusive enclaves. By late afternoon, agents were still  searching the house on Old Mill Road.    Several children as well as a maid were being detained inside the house, agents  said.    DEA agents also served as many as 20 search warrants in San Marino, Alhambra,  Pasadena and San Dimas, the source said. Roca's bank accounts were seized, and  his properties searched. A house searched in San Dimas has 10,000 square feet  of living space and was purchased by Roca for $2 million in cash, the source  said.    Roca is from the northeastern Beni region of Bolivia and is known as ""Techo de  Paja (Straw Roof)"" because of his blond hair. His arrest, sources said, is seen  as a coup for the DEA because the agency will not need to go through the  process of trying to extradite him from a foreign country.    Roca is the nephew of Roberto Suarez Gomez, a DEA fugitive who is currently  serving a 15-year sentence in Bolivia on drug charges. Suarez, the patriarch of  a respected cattle-ranching family, became known in the 1970s and early 1980s  as the ruler of Bolivia's biggest cocaine-trafficking empires and the ""king of  cocaine"" in that South American country. Bolivian officials have refused U.S.  requests for his extradition.    Roca reportedly grew up with his mother in Los Angeles and returned to Bolivia  when he was about 20. He allegedly was one of his uncle's trusted lieutenants.  He allegedly betrayed Suarez and now, according to law enforcement officials,  rules the Bolivian cocaine trade along with a group of younger cocaine  traffickers who provide tons of the drug for the U.S. and European drug  markets.    County property records indicate that ""George and Cirila Roca"" bought the San  Marino home for $1.4 million in July, 1988.    Don Banderas, principal of San Marino High School, said Jorge Roca-Suarez told  him he was in the real estate business. Roca's 17-year-old son enrolled in the  school in September along with three other relatives, either siblings or  cousins, the principal said.    Although the average family income in San Marino is about $127,000, some of the  Rocas' neighbors in the San Gabriel Valley city were struck by their apparent  wealth.    ""One of my neighbors did say he (had) too many fancy cars and stuff,"" said one  woman who spoke on condition of anonymity.    Another neighbor said that the family lived quietly and put a lot of work into  the house.    ""It's getting scary,"" said one woman who noted that the house is located half a  block from the scene of a Feb. 5, 1988, shoot-out between DEA agents and a  carload of Taiwanese drug suspects that left two agents and two suspects dead.  ""I think I'll move,"" she added, with a laugh.    Bolivia is a significant cog in the international cocaine trade and provides a  large proportion of the coca leaves and cocaine paste that are eventually  refined into powdered and rock cocaine.    Illegal drug trafficking in the country began in earnest in the 1970s under the  tutelage of the Colombian traffickers. In his heyday, Roca's uncle, Suarez,  lived and operated virtually with impunity. He once even offered to pay the  Bolivian foreign debt -- an offer that the government rejected.    The Bolivian press once quoted him as bragging that he had $400 million and 40  airplanes.    He was arrested in 1988, however, and sent to a La Paz penitentiary. Soon  after, then-U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz applauded the arrest as a  ""triumph of law enforcement"" in the South American country.    But DEA officials said Roca -- once a trusted lieutenant in the ring -- had  already taken over the drug operation by dealing on his own with the Colombian  drug cartels, supplying them with semi-refined cocaine paste at prices lower  than those charged by his uncle.    In August, 1988, a DEA spokesman said Roca ""knows we are investigating him, and  he may be afraid of going back (to the United States) now."" It was unknown when  Roca returned.

The Central Bank of Libya, commenting on Wednesday on the routine renewal of US sanctions, said the restrictions could make it impossible for Libya to pay foreign companies and workers or contribute to international organisations. But foreign businessmen in Tripoli said the Libyan government had given no sign that payments would be held up. According to the representative of one European company: 'Contracts are being carried out normally and I don't expect that there will be any disruption immediately.' A Libyan banker, who asked not to be named, said the US decision last week to extend sanctions for six months was no different from extensions Washington has announced at six-monthly intervals since 1986. The sanctions freeze Libyan assets in US banks and ban trade with or travel to Libya by US companies or individuals. The central bank, however, portrayed the renewal as an escalation in the dispute between Tripoli and Washington over the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. The US and Britain have accused two Libyan agents of planting explosives aboard the aircraft and have demanded that Libya extradite the men to stand trial in the west. Washington is considering further measures against Libya, not excluding military action, if the men are not extradited. Diplomats said that as a precaution Libya had transferred billions of dollars from banks in Europe to banks in the Middle East. Libyan officials have said privately that contracts with European companies could be used as to deter Europe from following the US lead in applying new sanctions. The main European countries targeted are Italy, France, Belgium and Germany. South Korean and Turkish companies also have large contracts with Libya.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

The labourers will cross the old green-line border into Israel today for the first time since the Hamas suicide bombing which killed 22 bus passengers and wounded 47 in Tel Aviv two weeks ago. The number of permits will be gradually increased. The first group are married men aged 40 or over. Before the closure about 65,000 workers travelled daily to jobs in Israeli construction, farming and services. The reopening eases fears that keeping the workers from their livelihood fuelled support for the Islamic fundamentalists. In Gaza alone, unemployment was running at up to 60 per cent even before the closure. The Palestinian Workers Union estimated that the closure cost West Bank workers Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.5m) a day. At the Erez terminal between Gaza and Israel, the Israelis are investing Dollars 30m in sophisticated computer equipment to combat a racket in forged permits. Once it is installed, every Palestinian worker will be checked on screen against his or her photograph and personal data. Ministers admitted that none of the recent attacks inside Israel was committed by permit holders. Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said yesterday the closure had been necessary to restore calm. The Palestinian flag was raised yesterday alongside the Israeli flag at two border crossings from Egypt and Jordan. From now on entry through Rafah and the Allenby Bridge will be controlled jointly by Israeli and Palestinian police. In a complex arrangement agreed in Cairo six months ago, Israel retains overall responsibility for security at the crossings. Residents of the Gaza and Jericho enclaves, now ruled by Mr Yassir Arafat's Palestinian National Authority, will be checked only by Palestinians. Residents of the still-occupied West Bank will pass through Palestinian and Israeli counters. Israeli citizens will be checked only by Israelis.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

Worst of all was the Shatt al Arab boundary, which penalised the country which has almost no access to the sea while rewarding Iran, blessed with a more than ample coastline. This short-sighted arrangement was one of the chief causes of the Iraqi war with Iran in the 1980s. It has been disheartening to learn that a similar mistake has been made  - apparently secretly - in recent days. You rightly hinted at it in your editorial ('Gulf war revisited', January 14) by speaking of the Umm Qasr port area as land which 'the United Nations now recognises as Kuwaiti territory'. It did not do so two days ago. Until then, it belonged to Iraq, as it had since the country made its first appearance as a state in modern times. Now the UN has given away a piece of Iraq. I visited Umm Qasr port in the 1960s, when no one doubted that it was a possession, indeed a proud new creation, of Iraq. To cut it off from its hinterland seems clumsy. To confiscate part of the minuscule coastline of a country which went to war two years ago partly for the lack of an adequate one is gratuitously to sow seeds of future instability where there are quite enough already. To leave the new border unprotected has been to invite (entrap?) the Iraqis into crossing it to retrieve their equipment. Is it any wonder that they have so lost control of themselves in recent days as to provoke the allies into again bombing their long-suffering country.

0,FT941-10619 ,"FT941-10619 _AN-EBIDBAAMFT 940209   FT  09 FEB 94 / Doubts persist on Bosnia air strikes: Growing pressure for action in the republic      By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor   The massacre of 68 shoppers in a Sarajevo market last weekend has concentrated world attention as never before on the need for effective action in Bosnia. Even those, like Britain, who have always had deep reservations about the usefulness of military intervention, are talking about more 'muscular' action. And even that paragon of caution, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, has said that the Sarajevo atrocity 'brings us near a decision, in one way or another, to use force'. Yet for all the huffing and puffing and the widespread feeling that 'enough is enough', a big question-mark hangs over the use of air power  - the only type of military action any of the western powers is prepared to contemplate. The statement issued by the European Union's foreign ministers at their meeting in Brussels on Monday that Nato and the United Nations should try to lift the siege of Sarajevo 'using all means necessary, including the use of air power', certainly marks a political change of direction. Only last spring the Europeans rejected a US proposal which included the use of air strikes against Bosnian Serb artillery positions, as well as the selective lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems. In practice, however, a decision to go ahead with air strikes now lies in the hands of Nato, which has been asked by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, to authorise such bombing raids, if these are considered feasible and once the responsibility for the Sarajevo massacre is deemed to have been clearly established. The advice of senior Nato and UN commanders will be crucial in any final decision to launch air strikes and it is no secret that most military experts are extremely sceptical about their effectiveness in Bosnia's wooded and mountainous terrain. After a two-hour meeting of President Bill Clinton's senior national security advisers on Monday, Mr William Perry, defence secretary, indicated that he and General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had expressed their doubts about such a course of action. 'We take very seriously the limitations of air strikes against, first of all, artillery type targets, and secondly, any targets that are embedded in a civilian population.' Bosnian Serb artillery and tank positions, when they are not concealed in forest, are reported to be highly mobile and easily relocated when under attack. If they were deployed in populated areas, air strikes would risk killing innocent civilians. Moreover, Serb and Moslem positions are frequently so close to each other that bombing raids could kill combatants from both sides. Quite apart from the military limitations of air strikes - recognised by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, when he said a whole range of other options were also being considered - there are many political and, ultimately humanitarian drawbacks. The launching of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, by triggering retaliation against inadequate UN forces, could bring to an end the whole UN peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and greatly jeopardise, if not halt altogether, the delivery of international aid. Equally serious, air strikes, while satisfying the growing desire of western public opinion and governments for punitive action, are unlikely to bring a political solution any nearer. That is why Britain, as well as the US, continue to insist that they be linked to clear objectives that would end the conflict. Both France and Britain have been doing their utmost, so far with little success, to persuade the US to become more closely involved in the peace negotiations. The US, which was responsible for sinking the original Vance-Owen plan for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, has been equally unenthusiastic about the international mediators' subsequent project. This would carve the country up into three ethnic mini-states - Serb, Moslem and Croat - but has proved unacceptable to the Moslems, who argue that the territory allocated to them does not amount to a viable country. Washington has all along refused to support a solution which is not approved by the Moslems, thus making sure that the stalemate at the Geneva peace conference, which has been further exacerbated by Croat-Moslem fighting and territorial disputes, will not be broken. One possible way out of that stalemate is agreement by the three warring parties to the mediators' proposal that, as a first step, a separate agreement should be reached on Sarajevo, which would demilitarise the city and place it under UN administration. Such a partial solution, which would cover an area of some 1,500 sq km around Sarajevo, would relieve the siege of the city by putting it out of range of Serb guns. Lord Owen, the EU's representative, has indicated that Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, would be willing to negotiate such an agreement, though the latter is notorious for failing to keep his word. A rapid separate agreement on Sarajevo, on which talks are due to be held in Geneva tomorrow, could be the best way of avoiding a military escalation in Bosnia, with unforeseeable consequences. It could also be the first step towards an overall peace settlement, which remains the only way to end the conflict.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.

But the announcement was received with considerable scepticism, after numerous previous Libyan promises and evasions. 'The question of timing is still under discussion,' a UN spokesman said after a meeting between Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, and Mr Omar al-Muntasser, the Libyan foreign minister. They are to have further talks today, when Mr Muntasser will also address the UN General Assembly. Diplomats said Libya's response may have been prompted by a deadline set by the Security Council. If it does not agree by tomorrow to submit the suspects for trial, a resolution imposing a freeze on Libyan financial assets abroad and an embargo on oil-related equipment supplies will be considered. Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, who is in New York for the UN session, remained wary about Libyan intentions. Reacting to a statement issued earlier in the day by the Libyan 'Bureau for Foreign Liaison and International Co-operation', he said he was interested only in getting the suspects to Scotland or the US to stand trial. They are accused of masterminding the bombing of the Pan Am jet that exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988 with the loss of 270 lives. Under a Security Council resolution last year, Libya's air links were severed and a ban on shipments of aircraft and parts was imposed, along with an embargo on arms sales and a reduction of Libyan diplomatic staff around the world. While yesterday's developments indicated that Libya might be becoming less intransigent in the face of tougher sanctions, its position remained ambiguous. The Libyan official statement said the suspects would be encouraged to go to Scotland but added that 'one step' remained: 'acceptance by the suspects, their families and lawyers to appear before the Scottish court'.

The threat in a communique distributed in the occupied  territories came a day after a suicide bomber from the Hamas  armed wing 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam killed seven Israelis and  wounded 45 at 'Afula.    That was just the first of five major attacks to come on  Israeli targets in revenge for the Hebron mosque massacre of 30  Moslems by a Jewish settlers on February 25, Hamas said.

""We will guarantee Arafat's position as president if he  agrees.    The communique noted that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam waited until  the traditional Moslem day of mourning 40 days after the Hebron  slaughter to carry out the bombing in 'Afula, northern Israel.

0," LA111489-0010   134302    November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition      Metro; Part B; Page 1; Column 5; Metro Desk      931 words      JUDGES PROBE PROSECUTORS' CHOICES ON DRUG ARRESTS;    ENFORCEMENT: DEFENSE LAWYERS CLAIM POLICE TARGET MINORITIES UNDER 'SCHOOLYARD'  LAW. PROSECUTORS SAY OFFICERS GO WHERE PROBLEM IS GREATEST.      By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Three federal judges sharply questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers Monday  about claims that the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles has selectively  targeted blacks and Latinos for prosecution under a 1986 federal law requiring  stiff prison terms for dealing drugs near schoolyards, playgrounds and video  arcades.    U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. said the judges had decided to jointly  question the lawyers because nine currently pending cases in federal court here  raise the same question. But Byrne said the judges would rule separately on  whether each case should be dismissed on grounds of selective prosecution.    Congress passed the so-called ""schoolyard law"" as part of the Controlled  Substances Act to combat drug sales within 1,000 feet of a schoolyard, or 100  feet of a playground or video arcade.    Local authorities have made virtually every arrest in these cases in Southern  California. They then consulted the U.S. attorney's office to determine whether  the defendant should be prosecuted in state or federal court.    Where these cases are prosecuted is significant, because federal sentences are  stiffer. For example, a defendant in state court could receive only a six-month  sentence for an offense that would bring 20 years in federal court.    Judge Byrne said the defense lawyers would have a tough task to prove selective  prosecution.    ""We might be terribly concerned about how these cases were selected,"" he said,  but ""the only way you can prevail on this motion is to prove that the selection  (of defendants) was made on the basis of race.""    The U.S. attorney's office set up a special program to prosecute schoolyard  cases in 1987.    Defense attorney Mary Gibbons of North Hollywood told the judges that since  then, 91 of the 92 people charged under the law in federal court here were  either black or Latino. She said this showed that the U.S. attorney's office  was intentionally targeting minorities for prosecution.    ""They're only looking in South-Central Los Angeles and the Hispanic areas,""  Gibbons said. ""They're just not looking in white areas for schoolyard cases.  They're only looking in areas where they're going to find minorities.""    Such enforcement, she said, raises further questions about the tactics of the  Los Angeles Police Department and the U.S. attorney's office..    Gibbons said the U.S. attorney's office has jurisdiction in seven Southern  California counties, but the only cases it had filed under the schoolyard law  were generated by police agencies in Los Angeles County -- primarily the Los  Angeles Police Department.    Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven G. Madision replied that ""race was not a factor"" in  the office's decisions on whom to prosecute. He said the decisions were based  on criteria set out by former U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner Jr. -- primarily the  quantity of drugs sold and whether the person had prior convictions. Persons  who did not meet the criteria were referred to the district attorney's office  for prosecution in state court.    However, Madison said he did not know the answer to several questions posed by  judges Byrne, Terry J. Hatter Jr. and Mariana R. Pfaelzer. They included how  many of the cases involved children, how many of the arrests were made at  night, how many of the arrests were made in public housing projects and the  racial composition of persons whose cases were referred to state court. Federal  Judge Richard A. Gadbois Jr. also participated in Monday's hearing, but did not  question the attorneys.    The judges indicated that they were wary of granting defense lawyers extensive  discovery because of what they considered the wide-ranging nature of the  requests. Judge Pfaelzer called their request for information on how officials  in the LAPD made decisions about what areas to target ""very-far reaching.""    However, the judges also indicated that they were puzzled that there were  virtually no cases involving white defendants, as it is well-known that there  is considerable drug-dealing in some white neighborhoods and in some schools  with predominantly white student bodies.    ""Why are all these cases from minority areas?"" Hatter asked Madison.    ""The police went where they thought the problems were the greatest,"" the  prosecutor replied.    Later, Hatter said he believed the LAPD could generate cases from white schools  because ""they have undercover agents"" in those schools.    ""Isn't the real problem (that) nothing was being presented to you (for  prosecution) except minority cases?"" Pfaelzer asked Madison.    He responded that he didn't know, because ""we don't keep records on race.""    For months, several federal judges have privately expressed dismay about some  of the schoolyard cases filed in Los Angeles. The judges feel that some of  these cases are more appropriate for state court because they are generated by  local law enforcement and do not involve large-scale crimes.    Byrne said he had handled one case where ""a 20-year-old girl"" was charged and  convicted under the law after selling $25 worth of crack cocaine to an elderly  LAPD informant while in her boyfriend's apartment in a housing project within  1,000 feet of a schoolyard.    The woman received a five-year sentence, a mandatory minimum under current  federal law. Byrne questioned the wisdom of ""the prosecutorial discretion""  involved in filing the case in federal court rather than state court.

PROSECUTORS SAY OFFICERS GO WHERE PROBLEM IS GREATEST.      By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Three federal judges sharply questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers Monday  about claims that the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles has selectively  targeted blacks and Latinos for prosecution under a 1986 federal law requiring  stiff prison terms for dealing drugs near schoolyards, playgrounds and video  arcades.    U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. said the judges had decided to jointly  question the lawyers because nine currently pending cases in federal court here  raise the same question. But Byrne said the judges would rule separately on  whether each case should be dismissed on grounds of selective prosecution.    Congress passed the so-called ""schoolyard law"" as part of the Controlled  Substances Act to combat drug sales within 1,000 feet of a schoolyard, or 100  feet of a playground or video arcade.    Local authorities have made virtually every arrest in these cases in Southern  California. They then consulted the U.S. attorney's office to determine whether  the defendant should be prosecuted in state or federal court.    Where these cases are prosecuted is significant, because federal sentences are  stiffer. For example, a defendant in state court could receive only a six-month  sentence for an offense that would bring 20 years in federal court.    Judge Byrne said the defense lawyers would have a tough task to prove selective  prosecution.    ""We might be terribly concerned about how these cases were selected,"" he said,  but ""the only way you can prevail on this motion is to prove that the selection  (of defendants) was made on the basis of race.""    The U.S. attorney's office set up a special program to prosecute schoolyard  cases in 1987.    Defense attorney Mary Gibbons of North Hollywood told the judges that since  then, 91 of the 92 people charged under the law in federal court here were  either black or Latino. She said this showed that the U.S. attorney's office  was intentionally targeting minorities for prosecution.    ""They're only looking in South-Central Los Angeles and the Hispanic areas,""  Gibbons said. ""They're just not looking in white areas for schoolyard cases.  They're only looking in areas where they're going to find minorities.""    Such enforcement, she said, raises further questions about the tactics of the  Los Angeles Police Department and the U.S. attorney's office..    Gibbons said the U.S. attorney's office has jurisdiction in seven Southern  California counties, but the only cases it had filed under the schoolyard law  were generated by police agencies in Los Angeles County -- primarily the Los  Angeles Police Department.    Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven G. Madision replied that ""race was not a factor"" in  the office's decisions on whom to prosecute. He said the decisions were based  on criteria set out by former U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner Jr. -- primarily the  quantity of drugs sold and whether the person had prior convictions. Persons  who did not meet the criteria were referred to the district attorney's office  for prosecution in state court.    However, Madison said he did not know the answer to several questions posed by  judges Byrne, Terry J. Hatter Jr. and Mariana R. Pfaelzer. They included how  many of the cases involved children, how many of the arrests were made at  night, how many of the arrests were made in public housing projects and the  racial composition of persons whose cases were referred to state court. Federal  Judge Richard A. Gadbois Jr. also participated in Monday's hearing, but did not  question the attorneys.    The judges indicated that they were wary of granting defense lawyers extensive  discovery because of what they considered the wide-ranging nature of the  requests. Judge Pfaelzer called their request for information on how officials  in the LAPD made decisions about what areas to target ""very-far reaching.""    However, the judges also indicated that they were puzzled that there were  virtually no cases involving white defendants, as it is well-known that there  is considerable drug-dealing in some white neighborhoods and in some schools  with predominantly white student bodies.    ""Why are all these cases from minority areas?"" Hatter asked Madison.    ""The police went where they thought the problems were the greatest,"" the  prosecutor replied.    Later, Hatter said he believed the LAPD could generate cases from white schools  because ""they have undercover agents"" in those schools.    ""Isn't the real problem (that) nothing was being presented to you (for  prosecution) except minority cases?"" Pfaelzer asked Madison.    He responded that he didn't know, because ""we don't keep records on race.""    For months, several federal judges have privately expressed dismay about some  of the schoolyard cases filed in Los Angeles. The judges feel that some of  these cases are more appropriate for state court because they are generated by  local law enforcement and do not involve large-scale crimes.    Byrne said he had handled one case where ""a 20-year-old girl"" was charged and  convicted under the law after selling $25 worth of crack cocaine to an elderly  LAPD informant while in her boyfriend's apartment in a housing project within  1,000 feet of a schoolyard.    The woman received a five-year sentence, a mandatory minimum under current  federal law. Byrne questioned the wisdom of ""the prosecutorial discretion""  involved in filing the case in federal court rather than state court.    ""That's a separate question"" from selective prosecution, Madison responded.    ""I guess it is,"" Byrne said. ""I hope someone is thinking about it because a  substantial number of us are deeply concerned about those decisions.""

Many of the provisions of E.O. 12291 pertain only to major rules. In the proposed rule, the Attorney General stated that this rule is not a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291. Therefore, section 4(b) of that Executive Order is inapplicable. With regard to E.O. 12778, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a Memorandum for Agency Regulatory Contacts dated January 9, 1992, stating that there are two ways that an agency may certify compliance to OMB as part of the regulatory review process. An agency may attach a certification of compliance with E.O. 12778 to Standard Form 83 signed by an attorney, or an agency may insert a statement of such certification in the preamble to the draft rule itself. The Department of Justice (Department), following review of the rule in light of E.O. 12778 and in compliance with that Executive Order, attached a certification of compliance. Accordingly, the Department and the Service believe that the requirements of E.O. 12291 (which was superseded by E.O. 12866 on September 30, 1993), 12866, and 12778 have been met.    One commenter stated that the proposed rule may be in violation of the Service's contract with its collective bargaining unit because the required negotiations have not occurred regarding those aspects of the rule that constitute substantive changes in conditions of employment affecting the bargaining unit. During development of the final rule, negotiations occurred with both the National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council and the National Border Patrol Council.    One commenter asserted that the existing Service Firearms Policy could not be changed because it constituted an agreement with the employee unions. The Service disagrees because there is no agreement between it and the employee unions regarding the existing Service Firearms Policy.    One commenter pointed out that the proposed rule failed to indicate whether the regulations would preempt state or local laws regarding peace officer status. The regulations implement new statutory authorities pertaining to arrests and service of process for federal matters and would not affect current practices with states. State law may provide immigration officers with peace officer status that would also provide the authority to make arrests for state law violations. However, unless specifically authorized as a peace officer under state law, an immigration officer's authority to enforce the state statute is that of an ordinary citizen. The limitations and liabilities associated with such action are defined in state law.    One commenter stated that the proposed regulations appeared to conflict with sections 101(a)(18) and 235 of the Act as they relate to the definition of ``immigration officer'' and an immigration officer's authority to administer oaths, take and consider evidence, and require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and production of documents. The Service disagrees. Section 101(a)(18) of the Act authorizes the Attorney General to designate, individually or by regulation, any employee or class of employees to perform the functions of an immigration officer specified by the Act or any section thereof. In the proposed regulations, the Attorney General accomplished this by designating those categories of immigration officers authorized to perform the functions of sections 242 and 287 of the Act. The commenter stated incorrectly that 287.5(a) of the proposed rule required certain immigration officers to obtain individual or class designation in order to be authorized to interrogate and administer oaths. The proposed rule in 287.5(a) allowed any immigration officer as defined in 8 CFR 103.1(q) to interrogate and administer oaths. With regard to subpoenas, the proposed rule made no changes to the current regulations in 287.4 pertaining to the subpoena process.    A number of commenters criticized the proposed rule for not providing a sufficient statement of the legislative history of section 503 of IMMACT in the Summary section. An adequate description of the requirements of section 503 was provided by the notice of proposed rulemaking in the Supplementary Information section of the rule in accordance with the Federal Register's document drafting requirements.    One commenter recommended that the effective date of the final rule for other than permanent full-time (OTP) immigration inspectors be extended to two years from date of publication in the     Federal Register     is order to have sufficient time to provide both basic immigration law enforcement training and training in the new enforcement standards. Such an extension is impracticable as many permanent full-time immigration officers will also need to receive both basic immigration law enforcement training and training in the new enforcement standards. It would be inappropriate to allow the OTP immigration officers to take more time in meeting the training timetable than the permanent full-time employees because this would result in having OTP immigration inspectors operating under the old regulations while working side by side with permanent full-time immigration inspectors recently trained in, and operating under, the new regulations. This situation would not only promote procedural inconsistencies and confusion, but also subject the public to two different regulatory standards at ports of entry. The Attorney General has delayed implementation of the final rule to one year from date of publication in order to ensure training of approximately 10,000 immigration officers in the new enforcement authorities and standards. The Attorney General recognizes the difficulties inherent in meeting this rigorous training schedule. However, she is committed to ensuring a consistent and unified implementation approach nationwide that only one delayed implementation date can provide.

0,FT922-4315 ,"FT922-4315 _AN-CFEA9AG6FT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Hidden evidence deprived Judith Ward of fair trial      By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent   THREE senior government forensic scientists 'took the law into their own hands' and concealed evidence that could have cleared Miss Judith Ward of IRA bombing charges at her trial 18 years ago, the Court of Appeal said yesterday. The court was giving judgment at the end of Miss Ward's appeal against conviction for the M62 army coach bombing, in which 12 people died, and two other explosions. Lord Justice Steyn said: 'On the scientific evidence deployed against her, Miss Ward did not have a fair trial.' Mr Douglas Higgs, the late Mr Walter Elliott and Mr George Berryman, all employed by the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment, withheld material evidence that might have changed the course of the trial, he said. They misled 'the prosecution and the defence in order to promote a cause which they had made their own, namely that Miss Ward had been in contact with nitroglycerine'. The court formally quashed her convictions as 'unsafe and unsatisfactory'. West Yorkshire police, who investigated the M62 bombing, Director of Public Prosecution staff and counsel advising them, psychiatrists who provided evidence about Miss Ward and the forensic scientists for the prosecution were all heavily criticised by the court for withholding evidence. Miss Ward was freed on bail three weeks ago after the Crown conceded that her confessions and scientific evidence purporting to show that she had handled explosives were unreliable. Mrs Barbara Mills QC, the DPP, said afterwards: 'Disclosure is in the forefront of prosecutors' minds. The public is rightly concerned, but the circumstances and atmosphere of 18 years ago were quite different.' The Home Office said it would study the judgment before deciding what action, if any, should be taken against the government scientists.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

Pol Col [Police Colonel] Sanit  Miphan, of the Tourist Police, said the terrorists, most of them  Palestinians, usually arrive in Thailand through the southern  provinces by way of Malaysia. ""Once they arrive in the four  southern provinces they destroy their fake Indian or Pakistani  passports and live among the local Muslims, waiting for new sets  of fake travel document,"" Sanit said.    Many of them specialize in the making of bombs and accept  commissions to carry out acts of terror and sabotage.  ""Afterwards, they usually flee the country through the southern  provinces into Malaysia, and onto a third country using fake  passports,"" he said.    Sanit said several suspected terrorists were known to have  taken refuge at some time or other in Bangkok's tourist district  of Soi Nana Nua frequented by visitors from the Middle East, as  well as various mosques in Bang Rak and Phra Khanong areas. He  said police also kept a dossier on Middle Eastern gangsters  active in Soi Nana and Bang Rak areas.    A close watch was being kept on areas frequented by Middle  Eastern visitors as part of the investigation into the discovery  of a truckload of explosives yesterday. Sanit called on foreign  tourists to report to police any foreigners they suspected of  involvement in crime, and not to panic because of yesterday's  discovery.    Shortly after the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New  York City in February last year, there was speculation that some  of the terrorists involved had slipped into Thailand and taken  refuge for a time before leaving for a third country.

Speaking in the European Parliament, he said: ""We cannot  block decisions by our partners (in the EC and the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation).""    Pangalos was speaking at a plenary session of the  Euro-Parliament on behalf of the current Greek presidency of the  E.C., which ends on June 31.    Greece has made clear it is opposed to military intervention  in Bosnia, including the use of air strikes against Serb  positions around Sarajevo.    Pangalos reiterated the Greek position, but said Athens  would  not stand in the way of its partners which are poised to give  the green light for air bombing of the Serb positions.    The Greek minister said all the countries in the  neighbourhood of the Bosnian conflict were against military  intervention, except Turkey.    He was speaking as NATO ambassadors in Brussels met to  decide  on an ultimatum to the Serbs, that they cease their siege of  Sarajevo and withdraw their artillery from around the Bosnian  capital or face NATO air attacks.    NATO decisions need unanimous support, which means also the  backing of Athens.    Greece accepted a decision of E.C. foreign ministers in  Brussels on Monday that the EC should use all possible measures,  including air attacks, to break the siege of Sarajevo.    The Euro-MP's were generally supportive of NATO military  action. French Socialist Euro-MP Leon Schwartzenberg said: ""If  we don't want to act, let us at least give the (Moslem) Bosnians  the means to defend themselves.""    Liberal Dutch Euro-MP Jan Willem Bertens said the arms  embargo of former Yugoslavia should be lifted, and the Bosnian  Moslems armed to defend themselves, if the Serbs did not accept  a cease-fire in two weeks.

0," FBIS4-23108      ""cr00000032494001""        17 June 1994  FBIS  DUE TO COPYRIGHT OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS THE FOLLOWING  ITEM IS INTENDED FOR USE ONLY BY U.S. GOVERNMENT  CONSUMERS. IT IS BASED ON FOREIGN MEDIA CONTENT AND  BEHAVIOR AND IS ISSUED WITHOUT COORDINATION WITH OTHER  U.S. GOVERNMENT COMPONENTS.  FBIS TRENDS-15JUN94-EGYPT         Taking their lead from the government, Egyptian state-owned media            Taking their lead from the government, Egyptian state-owned media     have   undertaken a sweeping campaign against the Muslim  Brotherhood (MB) evidently intended to win popular support for a  continuing, but thus-far limited, crackdown against the group.  Those liberal commentators and secular opposition parties who  normally champion human rights have been relatively silent and  evidently ambivalent on the crackdown, and the MB itself has been  consciously restrained in an effort to avoid provoking further  measures against it.  Although Cairo does not seem inclined for  now to risk radicalizing the MB and its supporters with an all-  out crackdown, it does appear inclined to find some means to oust  the MB from leadership of the Lawyers' Syndicate--whose clash  with police in May over the death in detention of an Islamist  lawyer triggered the current crackdown.       Government, Media Curry Support for Moves Against Brotherhood   Since police on 17 May forcefully broke up an attempt by  demonstrators at the Lawyers Syndicate to march toward a nearby  presidential palace to protest the death in detention of Islamist  lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani (Al-Akhbar, 18 May) (See Note 1),  authorities have conducted a series of arrests and interrogations  of known and alleged MB officials with the evident aim of  intimidating the organization and tying them in the public eye to  the widely rejected violent Islamic militants.  Although the  government has consistently sought to keep the legally banned but  generally tolerated MB off balance with periodic arrests of  alleged members, the recent crackdown is striking because  prominent MB officials have been targeted and anti-Brotherhood  moves are taking place on several fronts simultaneously.   --Two MB members of the Lawyers Syndicate Board of Directors,  including the syndicate's treasurer--prominent Brotherhood figure  Mukhtar Nuh--were among the lawyers arrested after the 17 May  demonstration (MENA, 18 May).  They evidently remain in detention  (MENA, 15 June).   --On 29 May, authorities detained 10 MB figures, including  Ibrahim al-Gharab Sharaf--described by the Socialist Labor Party  (SLP) biweeky and MB mouthpiece as MB General Guide Hamid Abu-al-  Nasr's personal secretary and by Al-Ahram as a member of the  Guidance Bureau, the organization's top leadership.  Interior  Minister Hasan al-Alfi announced that those detained were accused  of ""membership in an organization that seeks to disrupt the rule  of law and influence the authorities, and possession of cassette  recordings and printed materials calling for stirring up hatred  of the regime"" (Al-Ahram, 5 June).  The arrests were linked to  the ""Salsabil case"" (Mena, 8 June; Al-Wafd, 1 June), which  developed from a February 1992 security raid on the Salsabil  computer company, an alleged MB front.  Officials have claimed  that the Salsabil office contained computer diskettes and  documents providing massive evidence of the MB's ""extremist  activities"" (MENA, 14 March 1992).   --MB General Guide Abu-al-Nasr was summoned for at least two  sessions of questioning about leaflets bearing his signature that  ""advocated views and terms opposed to the regime""' (MENA, 5 June,  6 June).  After Egyptian media published reports of his denials  during the interrogation of any wrongdoing by him or his  organization (MENA, 6 June), the government banned further media  coverage of his questioning or the Salsabil case (MENA, 8 June).   --Authorities recently prevented Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, an  Islamist preacher who has at times assisted government propaganda  efforts against extremism but has a strong following among the MB  and other Islamists and publishes a regular column in Al-Sha'b, from  delivering an annual outdoor sermon on the occasion of the 'Id al-  Adha holiday, marking the pilgrimage to Mecca.  (Al-Sha'b, 27 May).  Suggesting government concern over how the public would view the  act, al-Alfi subsequently received al-Ghazali in an evidently  conciliatory meeting that was publicized in the media with no  details of their conversation (MENA, 29 May).   (Note 1) Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi has sought to counter  charges that Madani died as a result of torture by claiming that  the lawyer died prior to interrogation from an acute asthma  attack.  Moreover, he has stressed that Madani had been using his  work as a cover for active collusion with the Islamic militants  (MENA, 21 May).  Criminalizing the MB   President Mubarak, who has tended to be relatively restrained in  his public references to the Brotherhood, helped lay the  groundwork for the crackdown with statements that were unusually  harsh in tone and content.  Suggesting the government may have  anticipated the 17 May clash, Mubarak had attacked the group in  an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel that appeared the  day before the clash.  According to Egyptian media, Mubarak told  the magazine that the Brotherhood """"stands behind . . . and  finances most of the activities of the terrorist groups in Egypt""  (MENA 16 May) (See Note 2).  Earlier, in an attempt to justify  the MB's exclusion from a planned ""national dialogue"" putatively  including all ""legitimate"" political forces, Mubarak used a Labor  Day speech to score the Brotherhood implicitly by asserting:  ""Dialogue is not meant to open back doors for illegitimate powers  that mix religion with political activity to put themselves above  the law, antagonize and fight the multiparty system until they  monopolize the national arena, and pounce on the chance to rule,  kill democracy, and let one view and one line of thinking do away  with every thinker who dares oppose or discuss"" (Cairo radio, 28  April) (See Note 3).   (Note 2) The text of the speech as published in Der Spiegel  quoted him as charging the Brotherhood more vaguely with being  ""behind most of the activities of the religious troublemakers.""   (Note 3) Although Mubarak's public offensive against the  Brotherhood may have been made with an eye to justifying concrete  measures against the group, an earlier statement by Interior  Minister Hasan al-Alfi suggests that the current crackdown was  hastily undertaken.  Responding to a question at a 13 April press  conference, al-Alfi seemingly absolved the organization of  support for terrorism by distinguishing between the MB as ""a  propagator of religion only"" and the Islamic militants as ""the  terrorist groups"" (MENA, 13 April).      The Interior Ministry has backed up the security campaign with  statements portraying the Brotherhood as an illegal organization,  with at least some members engaged in violence.  In the most  striking example, al-Alfi claimed in an interview with the  Egyptian newspaper Al-Akhbar Al-Yawm that ""The MB is an illegal  organization, and the appearance of those belonging to it on the  stage [during the protests over Madani's death] confirms that  they have a role in terrorism."" (21 May).  Subsequently, however,  he appeared somewhat less sweeping in his claims, saying in  response to a question at a conference of Egyptian and French  businessmen that ""certain acts and facts indicate that some MB  members,"" including ""more than 100 people,"" had ""committed acts  punishable by law"" (MENA, 14 June).   Anti-MB Media Campaign      Responding to the official signals conveyed through the arrests  and interrogations of MB officials and the statements by Mubarak  and al-Alfi--in addition to probable direct official  encouragement to the semi-independent government-owned press--the  media last month launched the most vigorous campaign against the  Muslim Brotherhood observed in recent years (See Note 4).  Reports, exposes, and editorial commentary have sought to tarnish  the reputation of the group as a whole, in some cases accusing it  implicitly or explicitly of ties to violence.  The rhetoric has  included the consistent prefacing of references to the  Brotherhood with adjectives indicating its illegal status.  Among the most noteworthy illustrations of this media campaign:   --The weekly news magazine Al-Musawwar has been publishing a  sensationalist cover series on the transcripts of 14 documents  alleged to have been seized from Salsabil and portrayed by the  magazine as confirming allegations that the Brotherhood has a  secret organization and international structure and is committed  to overthrowing the regime (3 and 11 June).  The magazine also  published photographs of parts of the documents, which Chief  Editor Makram Muhammad Ahmad claimed the magazine's staff had  been studying for six months (27 May).  The documents, as  presented by Al-Musawwar, contain, inter alia: discussion of the  importance of establishing an MB presence in the professional  syndicates, student unions, and """"other establishments'""--claimed  by the magazine to mean the police and military--on a local,  national, and international level; a stress on the importance of  establishing a """"balance between secrecy and publicity"""" so as to  elude the authorities while still enabling the building of  grassroots support; guidance on dealing with security forces-  -including the handling of interrogations and recommendations for  the establishment of a liaison committee to win supporters among  the authorities and monitor their intentions toward the group;  and a complete breakdown of the structure of the various offices  of the organization down to the governorate level and including  names of MB officials nationwide.  The first part of the series  was a heavily editorialized summary of the transcripts portraying  them as proof that the Brotherhood's aims and means are  subversive and illegitimate.   --Chief editors of virtually all the main state-owned  publications, as well as some commentators with close ties to the  government broadened their criticism of the Lawyers Syndicate's  handling of the Madani death by directly attacking the MB.  For  example: Ibrahim Nafi', chief editor of the authoritative daily  Al-Ahram, claimed that the ""exploitation"" of Madani's death by  ""one of the legally banned political groups"" ""illustrates the  relationship between this dissolved group and other terrorist  groups"" (20 May); a column in Al-Ahram by writer Tharwat Abazah,  deputy speaker of the parliament's nominal upper chamber, the  Consultative Council, was entitled ""the Armed Brothers,"" a play  on the Arabic words for the Muslim Brothers.  Abazah claimed that  the ""Muslim Brothers, who are not Muslim  . . . , are the leaders  of terrorism"" (30 May).   (Note 4) The media campaign against the Brotherhood, however,  appears to be ebbing at least for now, amid the absence of any  further developments in the Lawyers Syndicate, the ban on  coverage of current legal cases against MB figures, and the lack  of a strong Brotherhood reaction.  Of the major state-owned  publications, only Al-Musawwar has continued to give prominence  to the subject.   Campaign to Oust MB From Syndicates      Supporting indications that the government will use the syndicate  incidents as a pretext to move against MB control of the Lawyers  syndicate--and possibly other syndicates--most of the recent  media rhetoric has targeted specifically the MB role in the  lawyers association (See Note 5).  Articles and commentaries have  sought to tarnish the Brotherhood's reputation by highlighting  allegations that the syndicate's MB-dominated board of directors  has grossly misused its authority and syndicate funds in an  effort to turn the professional union into a political arm of the  Brotherhood.  For example, lengthy reports in Al-Ahram and Al-  Musawwar accused the syndicate board, which Al-Musawwar  repeatedly called ""the Board of Brothers,"" of issuing the union's  quota of permits to attend the annual pilgrimage to Mecca on the  basis of MB affiliation; charged that the MB officials had  tampered with the lists of union members in an effort to ensure  the success of MB candidates in syndicate elections; and claimed  that massive syndicate funds have been diverted to the radical  Palestinian group Hamas and other MB causes, including exclusive  MB Ramadan banquets and the recent protest activities (Al-Ahram,  22 May; Al-Musawwar, 27 May).  Accordingly, Al-Musawwar's Makram  Muhammad Ahmad asked if the lawyers, ""after all that has happened  can leave their syndicate under the full control of one trend  that exploits"" its facilities and """"its stature for the service of  its goals.""   (Note 5) Even prior to the syndicate incidents there were  indications that the government would seek new legislation aimed  at the MB in the syndicates following the repeated postponement  of various syndicate elections evidently because of officials'  fears that MB candidates would fare well.  Parliament was  reportedly already considering changes to a 1993 law that  prescribes the appointment of a temporary board of directors for  any syndicate failing to draw at least a third of its members to  internal elections--changes that would address, inter alia,  alleged MB tampering with election lists.  Since 17 May, at least  one bill to reorganize the Lawyers Syndicate has reportedly been  forwarded to the People's Assembly, leading to further  speculation that the government will soon dissolve the current  syndicate board (for example, Rose Al-Yusuf, 6 June; Al-Ahali, 8  June).       Liberals, Leftists Largely Quiet, Ambivalent on Crackdown   Those secular mainstream and opposition writers who are often  critical of the government's handling of human rights and  political liberties issues have been relatively silent on the  current crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood--including  government efforts to portray the organization as a terrorist  group and the arrests and interrogations of prominent MB members  following protests over the death in detention of Islamist lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani.  These writers' low profile on the issue  reflects wariness of--in some cases hostility to--the Islamists,  despite evident ambivalence over the government's measures to  counter them.   --The most prominent liberal mainstream writers have not thus far  been observed to address Cairo's recent measures against the MB.  They include Mustafa Amin--a veteran journalist and daily columnist  for Al-Akhbar, who writes almost weekly criticizing moves against  democratic liberties and urging greater democracy and political  pluralism--and Al-Ahram's independent-minded Managing Editor  Salamah Ahmad Salamah--who, despite his position, has often  criticized official strategy against the Islamists and had scored  the government in a 14 May column for its handling of the Madani  case.   --There has been virtually no monitored authoritative reaction  explicitly addressing the anti-MB crackdown from the liberal,  centrist al-Wafd party, the Nasirites, or the leftist National  Progressive Unionist Grouping (NPUG)--all of which, despite  philosophical antipathy toward the Brotherhood, have periodically  collaborated with it (See Note 1).  Several comments from the  NPUG have all but openly supported the crackdown.  The English  language weekly edition of Al-Ahram quoted NPUG Secretary-General  Rif'at al-Sa'id--who has consistently been vocal in his distrust  of the MB--as claiming that ""the government has tolerated the  Brotherhood for years because it considered it harmless, but was  waking up to its 'danger'"" (2-8 June).  In another interview with  Al-Wafd, al-Sa'id was quoted as calling the MB an illegitimate  organization, pointing to MB Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur as  historically ""one of the most prominent MB planners of violence""  (1 June).      (Note 1) For example, leaders of all three parties joined with  the MB and other groups in a statement setting out their position  on the ""national dialogue"" called for by Mubarak last November  (Al-Wafd, 7 December).   Even coverage of the breakup of the 17 May demonstration over  Madani's death and of related arrests was somewhat mixed, despite  expressed concern over the human rights implications of the  Madani case and even involvement by the three main secular  opposition parties in syndicate activities organized to  protest Madani's death (Al-Ahram Weekly, 12-18 May).  For  example:   --Al-Wafd featured a commentary by Chief Editor Jamal Badawi that  criticized the government for mishandling the lawyers' protests  and the Madani affair in general (19 May)--a line echoed by some  columnists.  At the same time, the paper featured an article on  the 23d that blamed the protesters and the authorities equally  for the confrontation.   --The NPUG weekly Al-Ahali's only monitored authoritative  commentary following the confrontation was a column by Chief  Editor Lutfi Wakid expressing concern over reports that Madani  had confided knowledge to an independent parliamentary deputy of  a foreign conspiracy to sustain the current violence between  Islamic militants and the government (18 May).  Although one Al-  Ahali columnist criticized the syndicate arrests (25 May),  another offered justification, in effect, for the government's  decision to put down the demonstration by force (1 June).  The  latter column, by Mustafa Siyam, echoed government charges that  Madani was working with the terrorist groups and attacked the  Lawyers Syndicate for taking up the cause of someone ""arrested  for his political activity and not for his pure professional  work.""  He claimed that the would-be street marchers may well  have included supporters of the Islamic militants who would have  engaged in destruction of public property and thus presented a  threat to public order.  The column attacked the role of  Islamists in the syndicate, referring to them as ""the Muslim  Brothers and other terrorists.""   Ambivalence Over Crackdown's Cost   At the same time, some from the secular mainstream and opposition  have balanced their clear wariness of the MB with expressions of  concern that the government's wideranging measures to counter the  Islamists in general will come at too great a cost in political  liberties and perhaps fuel sympathy for the Islamists:   --Illustrating the ambivalence in these circles, leftist writer  'Abd-al-Sattar al-Tawilah followed up implicit criticism of the  crackdown in Al-Wafd with another commentary in Rose Al-Yusuf  that appeared to applaud it--a reflection as well of the  differing editorial slants of the two publications involved.  The  first commentary observed that '""most of the intellectuals and  supporters of democracy found themselves, in spite of themselves,  in one trench with the lawyers,"" because the issues with which  they were dealing--human rights, torture, etc.--were so important  (24 May).  Referring to the ""execution of Madani,"" al-Tawilah  claimed ""it is not true that the political Islamist trend must be  treated with a heavy hand,"" adding that ""the policy of heavy-  handedness must be used carefully and [only] in cases of extreme  necessity.""  Commenting a week later in Rose Al-Yusuf on the  syndicate incidents, al-Tawilah asserted that his magazine had  warned ""a number of times"" in ""the past two years"" against the  danger of ""those so-called moderates"" whose position on the  Islamic militants ""is considered in the final analysis collusion  with and approval of terrorism.""  He claimed that the Muslim  Brothers ""see in the extremist trend an extension of themselves  and their mission"" (30 May).   --While avoiding comment on the crackdown against the  Brotherhood, Al-Wafd Chief Editor Jamal Badawi addressed  government efforts to restrict Islamists' activities in general  by strongly criticizing the recent barring of Shaykh Muhammad al-  Ghazali from delivering an annual outdoor sermon during the 'Id  al-Adha holiday, saying that the ban appeared to be official  vengeance for al-Ghazali's controversial court testimony last  spring in which he claimed there was no known punishment in Islam  for those who take the law in their own hands by killing  apostates (24 May).  He claimed that ""the government's behavior  demonstrates its weakness and lack of confidence in dialogue"" (See  Note 2)   --Al-Wafd and other commentators have criticized another element  of the government's campaign to minimize the influence of  Islamists--its pushing of previously unpublicized legislation  through parliament on 30 May to replace the elections of  university deans by the faculties with their appointment by the  university presidents (Al-Akhbar, 31 May).  The measure followed  widely criticized legislation passed last April replacing the  election of village mayors with their appointment by the Interior  Ministry.  Numerous Al-Wafd columns criticized the most recent  legislation.  For example, Al-Wafd party official Nu'man Jum'ah  called it ""an aggression against democracy and the professors.""  Al-Akhbar columnist Mustafa Amin called the measure ""a new strike  against democracy,"" adding that ""if this strange trend continues  it will lead to the day when the deputies of the People's  Assembly are appointed rather than elected"" (1 June).   (Note 2)  Badawi's reference to ""dialogue"" clearly connoted the  ""national dialogue,"" which at this point had yet to convene.  Al-  Wafd withdrew from the committee subsequently formed to prepare  for the dialogue after its first session, claiming the  government's had formed the committee unilaterally and stacked it  with ruling party officials (MENA, 1 June).   Concern Over Syndicate Legislation   Consistent with the ambivalence of the secular oppositionists,  the principal secular parties have been relatively reserved in  responding to widespread media indications of pending legislation  to reconstitute the Lawyers Syndicate so as to diminish the MB  role.  Al-Wafd, for example, has avoided the vocal campaign that  preceded parliamentary consideration of the syndicates law of  1993 (Al-Wafd, 21 November and 3 December 1992).  At the same  time, there have been scattered appeals against any new  legislation on the syndicates.  For example:   --'Abd-al-Salam Rizq, a leftist member of the Lawyers Syndicate  board of directors, warned in an Al-Ahali article that dissolving  the current board, whether under a longstanding emergency law or  through new legislation, would be ""inappropriate,"" as it would  ""lead to extremely serious results"" (8 June).  Subsequently,  however, he appeared to focus solely on the need to avoid using  the emergency law to dissolve the syndicate's board, saying that  it would increase sympathy with the Islamists, who would be  viewed as ""martyrs of the emergency law.""  Finally, he declared  that ""whoever seeks to dissolve"" the board ""must resort to the  law without resorting to power or the use of dissolution options,  even if the government has accumulated justifications for  settling accounts with the Muslim Brotherhood.""   --A column on the ""Syndicates"" page of Al-Wafd expressed  opposition to any new change in the law governing the Lawyers  Syndicate or other attempts to dissolve the current board.  The  page's editor claimed that ""despite my differences with the  members of the board, this campaign [against the syndicate  board], which evidently goes back to instructions from on high,  has produced opposite results,"" explaining that ""the ordinary  citizen sympathizes with the board and with the lawyers.""  ""If  there is a decision to dissolve the board and change the law,"" he  maintained, ""the current board will be returned overwhelmingly'""  (30 May).   --In his Rose Al-Yusuf column accusing the Brotherhood of  collusion with the extremists, Tawilah asserted that ""'the  shrinking of control by the Islamist trend in the professional  syndicates must take place by way of political activation of all  the other forces in those syndicates and not by way of new laws.""       Defensive But Restrained, MB Seeks to Wait Out the Pressure   While vociferously rebutting recent government allegations  against it, the Muslim Brotherhood has made a point of  demonstrating restraint in an evident effort to deprive  authorities of any pretext to escalate the current crackdown.   --Shortly after the 17 May arrest of demonstraters at the Lawyers  Syndicate protesting the death in detention of Islamist lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani, An MB statement in Al-Sha'b--biweekly  organ of the Socialist Labor Party and MB mouthpiece--sought to  counter allegations that the group is committed to violence.  The  statement repeated longstanding claims that the Brotherhood's  """"program for teaching the ways of God the Almighty and religion  is a peaceful program,""' that the organization ""has taken part in  all aspects of life within the framework of the constitution and  laws in force"" and that it ""is not and will not be a group  advocating sedition and trouble and will not be the cause of  revolution or clashes.""  While asserting that future upheavals  may occur because of ""the absence of a response to the demands of  the people,"" the ""disregard for man's basic rights"" and the lack  of guarantees against election fraud, the statement was striking  for its defensive tone (Al-Sha'b, 20 May).   --MB Deputy General Guide Mustafa Mashhur used the MB's regular  column in Al-Sha'b on 7 June to urge Muslim Brothers to exercise  self-restraint in reacting to the government's offensive against  the organization.  Proclaiming that ""we carry out our activities  with moderation and through the state's institutions,"" he urged  MB followers ""not to be provoked into an action that conflicts  with the teachings of your God,"" adding that ""the strong ones do  not react emotionally but control themselves when they are  angry.""   --Mashhur has gone so far as to claim, according to the English  language weekly edition of Al-Ahram, that his organization ""will  not be involved in any escalation"" of the confrontation with the  government, ""even if the government steps up its measures"" (2-8  June).   Brotherhood officials have also used the secular opposition  press and the relatively independent Rose Al-Yusuf--which often  interview the Islamists regardless of their antipathy toward them--  to counter government charges that the organization supports  violence and is otherwise engaged in illegal activities.  In the past couple of weeks, the Nasirite weekly Al-'Arabi  interviewed Abu-al-Nasr, while the centrist Liberal Al-Wafd and  Rose Al-Yusuf carried interviews with Mashhur, and Al-Wafd  carried an interview with MB spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, all of  whom seized the proffered opportunity to defend the organization  (Al-'Arabi and Rose Al-Yusuf, 30 May; Al-Wafd, 1 June, 25 May,  respectively).   Lawyers Syndicate Cautious   Like the Brotherhood in general, the MB-dominated Lawyers  syndicate board has been relatively low-key in its response to the  arrests and continued detention of lawyers--including two MB  officials on the syndicate board--that followed the security  forces' breakup of the 17 May demonstration.  Al-'Arabi reported  on 30 May that the Lawyers Syndicate had called on all its  branches to hold meetings to discuss the situation following the  abortive 17 May demonstration, but the syndicate has not been  nearly as forceful as it was in its response to the announcement  of Madani's death, which promptly triggered a 10 May protest at  the syndicate and a 15 May lawyers' strike, as well as the 17 May  demonstration (Al-Ahram Weekly 12-18 May).   Moreover, Lawyers Syndicate Secretary-General Sayf-al-Islam Hasan  al-Banna--a prominent MB official--has evidently sought to  dissociate the Brotherhood from the more radical Islamist  lawyers, who were accused of attacking security forces with rocks  and bottles at the 17 May demonstration.  According to Al-  Musawwar on 27 May, al-Banna met at at his request with  Parliamentary speaker Fathi Surur in an evident attempt to fend  off possible legislation to oust the Brotherhood from the Lawyers  Syndicate through new legislation.  Al-Banna was cited by Al-  Musawwar as saying that he had expressed disapproval of the  slogans and signs carried by some of the more radical lawyers at  the 17 May rally, over which he said the syndicate's board had  ""completely lost control.""  The report quoted al-Banna as saying  he intended to submit his own draft legislation to change the  current law governing the Lawyers Syndicate but gave no details.   Implications      The government probably has a combination of motives for  initiating the current campaign against the Brotherhood,  including an interest in diverting attention from the Madani case  and justifying the Brotherhood's exclusion from the ""national  dialogue.""  More important in the long term is the government's  likely concern over growing MB assertiveness in recent months and  wary anticipation of an MB attempt to enter candidates in  parliamentary elections expected in late 1995 after the MB  boycotted them in 1990.  Even if Cairo ultimately permits MB  participation, a clampdown on the syndicates would deprive it of  what has become an important political forum, and continued  pressure from security authorities may force the organization  into a lower profile election campaign.   For now at least, the government appears inclined to keep up  pressure on the Brotherhood while avoiding an all-out crackdown  that could alienate many Egyptians, as it probes further measures  to marginalize the organization through new legislation.  The  apparent ebbing of the media campaign, together with al-Alfi's  limiting of his most recent terrorism allegations to ""some  members of the MB""--presumably those arrested over the past two  years in the Salsabil case--seems to point against any imminent  sweeping move against the group as a whole.  In addition, the  evident reconciliation meeting between Interior Minister al-Alfi  and Shaykh al-Ghazali highlights apparent official wariness of  offending large numbers of Egyptians who sympathize with the  Islamist agenda.  At the same time, however, the current media  campaign is preparing the public for any further moves that the  government may ultimately adopt.   The liberal mainstream and secular opposition parties' relatively  tepid response thus far to the government crackdown against the  Brotherhood suggests that expected legislative measures aimed at  marginalizing the organization in the syndicates may not meet a  tremendous or universal outpouring of indignation.  At the same  time--given its longstanding emphasis on political pluralism and  liberties--the Wafd will likely express a degree of opposition  that may grow and find broad company in the liberal mainstream if  the current campaign against the Islamists is significantly  escalated or broadened.   The Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, appears intent on patiently  waiting out the current storm to see whether or not it will  produce a markedly new political environment demanding new  strategies and tactics.  If the environment is changed to the  point where the MB can no longer function effectively, at least  some elements of the organization will certainly turn to more  radical activities.

Those liberal commentators and secular opposition parties who  normally champion human rights have been relatively silent and  evidently ambivalent on the crackdown, and the MB itself has been  consciously restrained in an effort to avoid provoking further  measures against it.  Although Cairo does not seem inclined for  now to risk radicalizing the MB and its supporters with an all-  out crackdown, it does appear inclined to find some means to oust  the MB from leadership of the Lawyers' Syndicate--whose clash  with police in May over the death in detention of an Islamist  lawyer triggered the current crackdown.       Government, Media Curry Support for Moves Against Brotherhood   Since police on 17 May forcefully broke up an attempt by  demonstrators at the Lawyers Syndicate to march toward a nearby  presidential palace to protest the death in detention of Islamist  lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani (Al-Akhbar, 18 May) (See Note 1),  authorities have conducted a series of arrests and interrogations  of known and alleged MB officials with the evident aim of  intimidating the organization and tying them in the public eye to  the widely rejected violent Islamic militants.  Although the  government has consistently sought to keep the legally banned but  generally tolerated MB off balance with periodic arrests of  alleged members, the recent crackdown is striking because  prominent MB officials have been targeted and anti-Brotherhood  moves are taking place on several fronts simultaneously.   --Two MB members of the Lawyers Syndicate Board of Directors,  including the syndicate's treasurer--prominent Brotherhood figure  Mukhtar Nuh--were among the lawyers arrested after the 17 May  demonstration (MENA, 18 May).  They evidently remain in detention  (MENA, 15 June).   --On 29 May, authorities detained 10 MB figures, including  Ibrahim al-Gharab Sharaf--described by the Socialist Labor Party  (SLP) biweeky and MB mouthpiece as MB General Guide Hamid Abu-al-  Nasr's personal secretary and by Al-Ahram as a member of the  Guidance Bureau, the organization's top leadership.  Interior  Minister Hasan al-Alfi announced that those detained were accused  of ""membership in an organization that seeks to disrupt the rule  of law and influence the authorities, and possession of cassette  recordings and printed materials calling for stirring up hatred  of the regime"" (Al-Ahram, 5 June).  The arrests were linked to  the ""Salsabil case"" (Mena, 8 June; Al-Wafd, 1 June), which  developed from a February 1992 security raid on the Salsabil  computer company, an alleged MB front.  Officials have claimed  that the Salsabil office contained computer diskettes and  documents providing massive evidence of the MB's ""extremist  activities"" (MENA, 14 March 1992).   --MB General Guide Abu-al-Nasr was summoned for at least two  sessions of questioning about leaflets bearing his signature that  ""advocated views and terms opposed to the regime""' (MENA, 5 June,  6 June).  After Egyptian media published reports of his denials  during the interrogation of any wrongdoing by him or his  organization (MENA, 6 June), the government banned further media  coverage of his questioning or the Salsabil case (MENA, 8 June).   --Authorities recently prevented Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, an  Islamist preacher who has at times assisted government propaganda  efforts against extremism but has a strong following among the MB  and other Islamists and publishes a regular column in Al-Sha'b, from  delivering an annual outdoor sermon on the occasion of the 'Id al-  Adha holiday, marking the pilgrimage to Mecca.  (Al-Sha'b, 27 May).  Suggesting government concern over how the public would view the  act, al-Alfi subsequently received al-Ghazali in an evidently  conciliatory meeting that was publicized in the media with no  details of their conversation (MENA, 29 May).   (Note 1) Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi has sought to counter  charges that Madani died as a result of torture by claiming that  the lawyer died prior to interrogation from an acute asthma  attack.  Moreover, he has stressed that Madani had been using his  work as a cover for active collusion with the Islamic militants  (MENA, 21 May).  Criminalizing the MB   President Mubarak, who has tended to be relatively restrained in  his public references to the Brotherhood, helped lay the  groundwork for the crackdown with statements that were unusually  harsh in tone and content.  Suggesting the government may have  anticipated the 17 May clash, Mubarak had attacked the group in  an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel that appeared the  day before the clash.  According to Egyptian media, Mubarak told  the magazine that the Brotherhood """"stands behind . . . and  finances most of the activities of the terrorist groups in Egypt""  (MENA 16 May) (See Note 2).  Earlier, in an attempt to justify  the MB's exclusion from a planned ""national dialogue"" putatively  including all ""legitimate"" political forces, Mubarak used a Labor  Day speech to score the Brotherhood implicitly by asserting:  ""Dialogue is not meant to open back doors for illegitimate powers  that mix religion with political activity to put themselves above  the law, antagonize and fight the multiparty system until they  monopolize the national arena, and pounce on the chance to rule,  kill democracy, and let one view and one line of thinking do away  with every thinker who dares oppose or discuss"" (Cairo radio, 28  April) (See Note 3).   (Note 2) The text of the speech as published in Der Spiegel  quoted him as charging the Brotherhood more vaguely with being  ""behind most of the activities of the religious troublemakers.""   (Note 3) Although Mubarak's public offensive against the  Brotherhood may have been made with an eye to justifying concrete  measures against the group, an earlier statement by Interior  Minister Hasan al-Alfi suggests that the current crackdown was  hastily undertaken.  Responding to a question at a 13 April press  conference, al-Alfi seemingly absolved the organization of  support for terrorism by distinguishing between the MB as ""a  propagator of religion only"" and the Islamic militants as ""the  terrorist groups"" (MENA, 13 April).      The Interior Ministry has backed up the security campaign with  statements portraying the Brotherhood as an illegal organization,  with at least some members engaged in violence.  In the most  striking example, al-Alfi claimed in an interview with the  Egyptian newspaper Al-Akhbar Al-Yawm that ""The MB is an illegal  organization, and the appearance of those belonging to it on the  stage [during the protests over Madani's death] confirms that  they have a role in terrorism."" (21 May).  Subsequently, however,  he appeared somewhat less sweeping in his claims, saying in  response to a question at a conference of Egyptian and French  businessmen that ""certain acts and facts indicate that some MB  members,"" including ""more than 100 people,"" had ""committed acts  punishable by law"" (MENA, 14 June).   Anti-MB Media Campaign      Responding to the official signals conveyed through the arrests  and interrogations of MB officials and the statements by Mubarak  and al-Alfi--in addition to probable direct official  encouragement to the semi-independent government-owned press--the  media last month launched the most vigorous campaign against the  Muslim Brotherhood observed in recent years (See Note 4).  Reports, exposes, and editorial commentary have sought to tarnish  the reputation of the group as a whole, in some cases accusing it  implicitly or explicitly of ties to violence.  The rhetoric has  included the consistent prefacing of references to the  Brotherhood with adjectives indicating its illegal status.  Among the most noteworthy illustrations of this media campaign:   --The weekly news magazine Al-Musawwar has been publishing a  sensationalist cover series on the transcripts of 14 documents  alleged to have been seized from Salsabil and portrayed by the  magazine as confirming allegations that the Brotherhood has a  secret organization and international structure and is committed  to overthrowing the regime (3 and 11 June).  The magazine also  published photographs of parts of the documents, which Chief  Editor Makram Muhammad Ahmad claimed the magazine's staff had  been studying for six months (27 May).  The documents, as  presented by Al-Musawwar, contain, inter alia: discussion of the  importance of establishing an MB presence in the professional  syndicates, student unions, and """"other establishments'""--claimed  by the magazine to mean the police and military--on a local,  national, and international level; a stress on the importance of  establishing a """"balance between secrecy and publicity"""" so as to  elude the authorities while still enabling the building of  grassroots support; guidance on dealing with security forces-  -including the handling of interrogations and recommendations for  the establishment of a liaison committee to win supporters among  the authorities and monitor their intentions toward the group;  and a complete breakdown of the structure of the various offices  of the organization down to the governorate level and including  names of MB officials nationwide.  The first part of the series  was a heavily editorialized summary of the transcripts portraying  them as proof that the Brotherhood's aims and means are  subversive and illegitimate.   --Chief editors of virtually all the main state-owned  publications, as well as some commentators with close ties to the  government broadened their criticism of the Lawyers Syndicate's  handling of the Madani death by directly attacking the MB.  For  example: Ibrahim Nafi', chief editor of the authoritative daily  Al-Ahram, claimed that the ""exploitation"" of Madani's death by  ""one of the legally banned political groups"" ""illustrates the  relationship between this dissolved group and other terrorist  groups"" (20 May); a column in Al-Ahram by writer Tharwat Abazah,  deputy speaker of the parliament's nominal upper chamber, the  Consultative Council, was entitled ""the Armed Brothers,"" a play  on the Arabic words for the Muslim Brothers.  Abazah claimed that  the ""Muslim Brothers, who are not Muslim  . . . , are the leaders  of terrorism"" (30 May).   (Note 4) The media campaign against the Brotherhood, however,  appears to be ebbing at least for now, amid the absence of any  further developments in the Lawyers Syndicate, the ban on  coverage of current legal cases against MB figures, and the lack  of a strong Brotherhood reaction.  Of the major state-owned  publications, only Al-Musawwar has continued to give prominence  to the subject.   Campaign to Oust MB From Syndicates      Supporting indications that the government will use the syndicate  incidents as a pretext to move against MB control of the Lawyers  syndicate--and possibly other syndicates--most of the recent  media rhetoric has targeted specifically the MB role in the  lawyers association (See Note 5).  Articles and commentaries have  sought to tarnish the Brotherhood's reputation by highlighting  allegations that the syndicate's MB-dominated board of directors  has grossly misused its authority and syndicate funds in an  effort to turn the professional union into a political arm of the  Brotherhood.  For example, lengthy reports in Al-Ahram and Al-  Musawwar accused the syndicate board, which Al-Musawwar  repeatedly called ""the Board of Brothers,"" of issuing the union's  quota of permits to attend the annual pilgrimage to Mecca on the  basis of MB affiliation; charged that the MB officials had  tampered with the lists of union members in an effort to ensure  the success of MB candidates in syndicate elections; and claimed  that massive syndicate funds have been diverted to the radical  Palestinian group Hamas and other MB causes, including exclusive  MB Ramadan banquets and the recent protest activities (Al-Ahram,  22 May; Al-Musawwar, 27 May).  Accordingly, Al-Musawwar's Makram  Muhammad Ahmad asked if the lawyers, ""after all that has happened  can leave their syndicate under the full control of one trend  that exploits"" its facilities and """"its stature for the service of  its goals.""   (Note 5) Even prior to the syndicate incidents there were  indications that the government would seek new legislation aimed  at the MB in the syndicates following the repeated postponement  of various syndicate elections evidently because of officials'  fears that MB candidates would fare well.  Parliament was  reportedly already considering changes to a 1993 law that  prescribes the appointment of a temporary board of directors for  any syndicate failing to draw at least a third of its members to  internal elections--changes that would address, inter alia,  alleged MB tampering with election lists.  Since 17 May, at least  one bill to reorganize the Lawyers Syndicate has reportedly been  forwarded to the People's Assembly, leading to further  speculation that the government will soon dissolve the current  syndicate board (for example, Rose Al-Yusuf, 6 June; Al-Ahali, 8  June).       Liberals, Leftists Largely Quiet, Ambivalent on Crackdown   Those secular mainstream and opposition writers who are often  critical of the government's handling of human rights and  political liberties issues have been relatively silent on the  current crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood--including  government efforts to portray the organization as a terrorist  group and the arrests and interrogations of prominent MB members  following protests over the death in detention of Islamist lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani.  These writers' low profile on the issue  reflects wariness of--in some cases hostility to--the Islamists,  despite evident ambivalence over the government's measures to  counter them.   --The most prominent liberal mainstream writers have not thus far  been observed to address Cairo's recent measures against the MB.  They include Mustafa Amin--a veteran journalist and daily columnist  for Al-Akhbar, who writes almost weekly criticizing moves against  democratic liberties and urging greater democracy and political  pluralism--and Al-Ahram's independent-minded Managing Editor  Salamah Ahmad Salamah--who, despite his position, has often  criticized official strategy against the Islamists and had scored  the government in a 14 May column for its handling of the Madani  case.   --There has been virtually no monitored authoritative reaction  explicitly addressing the anti-MB crackdown from the liberal,  centrist al-Wafd party, the Nasirites, or the leftist National  Progressive Unionist Grouping (NPUG)--all of which, despite  philosophical antipathy toward the Brotherhood, have periodically  collaborated with it (See Note 1).  Several comments from the  NPUG have all but openly supported the crackdown.  The English  language weekly edition of Al-Ahram quoted NPUG Secretary-General  Rif'at al-Sa'id--who has consistently been vocal in his distrust  of the MB--as claiming that ""the government has tolerated the  Brotherhood for years because it considered it harmless, but was  waking up to its 'danger'"" (2-8 June).  In another interview with  Al-Wafd, al-Sa'id was quoted as calling the MB an illegitimate  organization, pointing to MB Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur as  historically ""one of the most prominent MB planners of violence""  (1 June).      (Note 1) For example, leaders of all three parties joined with  the MB and other groups in a statement setting out their position  on the ""national dialogue"" called for by Mubarak last November  (Al-Wafd, 7 December).   Even coverage of the breakup of the 17 May demonstration over  Madani's death and of related arrests was somewhat mixed, despite  expressed concern over the human rights implications of the  Madani case and even involvement by the three main secular  opposition parties in syndicate activities organized to  protest Madani's death (Al-Ahram Weekly, 12-18 May).  For  example:   --Al-Wafd featured a commentary by Chief Editor Jamal Badawi that  criticized the government for mishandling the lawyers' protests  and the Madani affair in general (19 May)--a line echoed by some  columnists.  At the same time, the paper featured an article on  the 23d that blamed the protesters and the authorities equally  for the confrontation.   --The NPUG weekly Al-Ahali's only monitored authoritative  commentary following the confrontation was a column by Chief  Editor Lutfi Wakid expressing concern over reports that Madani  had confided knowledge to an independent parliamentary deputy of  a foreign conspiracy to sustain the current violence between  Islamic militants and the government (18 May).  Although one Al-  Ahali columnist criticized the syndicate arrests (25 May),  another offered justification, in effect, for the government's  decision to put down the demonstration by force (1 June).  The  latter column, by Mustafa Siyam, echoed government charges that  Madani was working with the terrorist groups and attacked the  Lawyers Syndicate for taking up the cause of someone ""arrested  for his political activity and not for his pure professional  work.""  He claimed that the would-be street marchers may well  have included supporters of the Islamic militants who would have  engaged in destruction of public property and thus presented a  threat to public order.  The column attacked the role of  Islamists in the syndicate, referring to them as ""the Muslim  Brothers and other terrorists.""   Ambivalence Over Crackdown's Cost   At the same time, some from the secular mainstream and opposition  have balanced their clear wariness of the MB with expressions of  concern that the government's wideranging measures to counter the  Islamists in general will come at too great a cost in political  liberties and perhaps fuel sympathy for the Islamists:   --Illustrating the ambivalence in these circles, leftist writer  'Abd-al-Sattar al-Tawilah followed up implicit criticism of the  crackdown in Al-Wafd with another commentary in Rose Al-Yusuf  that appeared to applaud it--a reflection as well of the  differing editorial slants of the two publications involved.  The  first commentary observed that '""most of the intellectuals and  supporters of democracy found themselves, in spite of themselves,  in one trench with the lawyers,"" because the issues with which  they were dealing--human rights, torture, etc.--were so important  (24 May).  Referring to the ""execution of Madani,"" al-Tawilah  claimed ""it is not true that the political Islamist trend must be  treated with a heavy hand,"" adding that ""the policy of heavy-  handedness must be used carefully and [only] in cases of extreme  necessity.""  Commenting a week later in Rose Al-Yusuf on the  syndicate incidents, al-Tawilah asserted that his magazine had  warned ""a number of times"" in ""the past two years"" against the  danger of ""those so-called moderates"" whose position on the  Islamic militants ""is considered in the final analysis collusion  with and approval of terrorism.""  He claimed that the Muslim  Brothers ""see in the extremist trend an extension of themselves  and their mission"" (30 May).   --While avoiding comment on the crackdown against the  Brotherhood, Al-Wafd Chief Editor Jamal Badawi addressed  government efforts to restrict Islamists' activities in general  by strongly criticizing the recent barring of Shaykh Muhammad al-  Ghazali from delivering an annual outdoor sermon during the 'Id  al-Adha holiday, saying that the ban appeared to be official  vengeance for al-Ghazali's controversial court testimony last  spring in which he claimed there was no known punishment in Islam  for those who take the law in their own hands by killing  apostates (24 May).  He claimed that ""the government's behavior  demonstrates its weakness and lack of confidence in dialogue"" (See  Note 2)   --Al-Wafd and other commentators have criticized another element  of the government's campaign to minimize the influence of  Islamists--its pushing of previously unpublicized legislation  through parliament on 30 May to replace the elections of  university deans by the faculties with their appointment by the  university presidents (Al-Akhbar, 31 May).  The measure followed  widely criticized legislation passed last April replacing the  election of village mayors with their appointment by the Interior  Ministry.  Numerous Al-Wafd columns criticized the most recent  legislation.  For example, Al-Wafd party official Nu'man Jum'ah  called it ""an aggression against democracy and the professors.""  Al-Akhbar columnist Mustafa Amin called the measure ""a new strike  against democracy,"" adding that ""if this strange trend continues  it will lead to the day when the deputies of the People's  Assembly are appointed rather than elected"" (1 June).   (Note 2)  Badawi's reference to ""dialogue"" clearly connoted the  ""national dialogue,"" which at this point had yet to convene.  Al-  Wafd withdrew from the committee subsequently formed to prepare  for the dialogue after its first session, claiming the  government's had formed the committee unilaterally and stacked it  with ruling party officials (MENA, 1 June).   Concern Over Syndicate Legislation   Consistent with the ambivalence of the secular oppositionists,  the principal secular parties have been relatively reserved in  responding to widespread media indications of pending legislation  to reconstitute the Lawyers Syndicate so as to diminish the MB  role.  Al-Wafd, for example, has avoided the vocal campaign that  preceded parliamentary consideration of the syndicates law of  1993 (Al-Wafd, 21 November and 3 December 1992).  At the same  time, there have been scattered appeals against any new  legislation on the syndicates.  For example:   --'Abd-al-Salam Rizq, a leftist member of the Lawyers Syndicate  board of directors, warned in an Al-Ahali article that dissolving  the current board, whether under a longstanding emergency law or  through new legislation, would be ""inappropriate,"" as it would  ""lead to extremely serious results"" (8 June).  Subsequently,  however, he appeared to focus solely on the need to avoid using  the emergency law to dissolve the syndicate's board, saying that  it would increase sympathy with the Islamists, who would be  viewed as ""martyrs of the emergency law.""  Finally, he declared  that ""whoever seeks to dissolve"" the board ""must resort to the  law without resorting to power or the use of dissolution options,  even if the government has accumulated justifications for  settling accounts with the Muslim Brotherhood.""   --A column on the ""Syndicates"" page of Al-Wafd expressed  opposition to any new change in the law governing the Lawyers  Syndicate or other attempts to dissolve the current board.  The  page's editor claimed that ""despite my differences with the  members of the board, this campaign [against the syndicate  board], which evidently goes back to instructions from on high,  has produced opposite results,"" explaining that ""the ordinary  citizen sympathizes with the board and with the lawyers.""  ""If  there is a decision to dissolve the board and change the law,"" he  maintained, ""the current board will be returned overwhelmingly'""  (30 May).   --In his Rose Al-Yusuf column accusing the Brotherhood of  collusion with the extremists, Tawilah asserted that ""'the  shrinking of control by the Islamist trend in the professional  syndicates must take place by way of political activation of all  the other forces in those syndicates and not by way of new laws.""       Defensive But Restrained, MB Seeks to Wait Out the Pressure   While vociferously rebutting recent government allegations  against it, the Muslim Brotherhood has made a point of  demonstrating restraint in an evident effort to deprive  authorities of any pretext to escalate the current crackdown.   --Shortly after the 17 May arrest of demonstraters at the Lawyers  Syndicate protesting the death in detention of Islamist lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani, An MB statement in Al-Sha'b--biweekly  organ of the Socialist Labor Party and MB mouthpiece--sought to  counter allegations that the group is committed to violence.  The  statement repeated longstanding claims that the Brotherhood's  """"program for teaching the ways of God the Almighty and religion  is a peaceful program,""' that the organization ""has taken part in  all aspects of life within the framework of the constitution and  laws in force"" and that it ""is not and will not be a group  advocating sedition and trouble and will not be the cause of  revolution or clashes.""  While asserting that future upheavals  may occur because of ""the absence of a response to the demands of  the people,"" the ""disregard for man's basic rights"" and the lack  of guarantees against election fraud, the statement was striking  for its defensive tone (Al-Sha'b, 20 May).   --MB Deputy General Guide Mustafa Mashhur used the MB's regular  column in Al-Sha'b on 7 June to urge Muslim Brothers to exercise  self-restraint in reacting to the government's offensive against  the organization.  Proclaiming that ""we carry out our activities  with moderation and through the state's institutions,"" he urged  MB followers ""not to be provoked into an action that conflicts  with the teachings of your God,"" adding that ""the strong ones do  not react emotionally but control themselves when they are  angry.""   --Mashhur has gone so far as to claim, according to the English  language weekly edition of Al-Ahram, that his organization ""will  not be involved in any escalation"" of the confrontation with the  government, ""even if the government steps up its measures"" (2-8  June).   Brotherhood officials have also used the secular opposition  press and the relatively independent Rose Al-Yusuf--which often  interview the Islamists regardless of their antipathy toward them--  to counter government charges that the organization supports  violence and is otherwise engaged in illegal activities.  In the past couple of weeks, the Nasirite weekly Al-'Arabi  interviewed Abu-al-Nasr, while the centrist Liberal Al-Wafd and  Rose Al-Yusuf carried interviews with Mashhur, and Al-Wafd  carried an interview with MB spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, all of  whom seized the proffered opportunity to defend the organization  (Al-'Arabi and Rose Al-Yusuf, 30 May; Al-Wafd, 1 June, 25 May,  respectively).   Lawyers Syndicate Cautious   Like the Brotherhood in general, the MB-dominated Lawyers  syndicate board has been relatively low-key in its response to the  arrests and continued detention of lawyers--including two MB  officials on the syndicate board--that followed the security  forces' breakup of the 17 May demonstration.  Al-'Arabi reported  on 30 May that the Lawyers Syndicate had called on all its  branches to hold meetings to discuss the situation following the  abortive 17 May demonstration, but the syndicate has not been  nearly as forceful as it was in its response to the announcement  of Madani's death, which promptly triggered a 10 May protest at  the syndicate and a 15 May lawyers' strike, as well as the 17 May  demonstration (Al-Ahram Weekly 12-18 May).   Moreover, Lawyers Syndicate Secretary-General Sayf-al-Islam Hasan  al-Banna--a prominent MB official--has evidently sought to  dissociate the Brotherhood from the more radical Islamist  lawyers, who were accused of attacking security forces with rocks  and bottles at the 17 May demonstration.  According to Al-  Musawwar on 27 May, al-Banna met at at his request with  Parliamentary speaker Fathi Surur in an evident attempt to fend  off possible legislation to oust the Brotherhood from the Lawyers  Syndicate through new legislation.  Al-Banna was cited by Al-  Musawwar as saying that he had expressed disapproval of the  slogans and signs carried by some of the more radical lawyers at  the 17 May rally, over which he said the syndicate's board had  ""completely lost control.""  The report quoted al-Banna as saying  he intended to submit his own draft legislation to change the  current law governing the Lawyers Syndicate but gave no details.   Implications      The government probably has a combination of motives for  initiating the current campaign against the Brotherhood,  including an interest in diverting attention from the Madani case  and justifying the Brotherhood's exclusion from the ""national  dialogue.""  More important in the long term is the government's  likely concern over growing MB assertiveness in recent months and  wary anticipation of an MB attempt to enter candidates in  parliamentary elections expected in late 1995 after the MB  boycotted them in 1990.  Even if Cairo ultimately permits MB  participation, a clampdown on the syndicates would deprive it of  what has become an important political forum, and continued  pressure from security authorities may force the organization  into a lower profile election campaign.   For now at least, the government appears inclined to keep up  pressure on the Brotherhood while avoiding an all-out crackdown  that could alienate many Egyptians, as it probes further measures  to marginalize the organization through new legislation.  The  apparent ebbing of the media campaign, together with al-Alfi's  limiting of his most recent terrorism allegations to ""some  members of the MB""--presumably those arrested over the past two  years in the Salsabil case--seems to point against any imminent  sweeping move against the group as a whole.  In addition, the  evident reconciliation meeting between Interior Minister al-Alfi  and Shaykh al-Ghazali highlights apparent official wariness of  offending large numbers of Egyptians who sympathize with the  Islamist agenda.  At the same time, however, the current media  campaign is preparing the public for any further moves that the  government may ultimately adopt.   The liberal mainstream and secular opposition parties' relatively  tepid response thus far to the government crackdown against the  Brotherhood suggests that expected legislative measures aimed at  marginalizing the organization in the syndicates may not meet a  tremendous or universal outpouring of indignation.  At the same  time--given its longstanding emphasis on political pluralism and  liberties--the Wafd will likely express a degree of opposition  that may grow and find broad company in the liberal mainstream if  the current campaign against the Islamists is significantly  escalated or broadened.   The Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, appears intent on patiently  waiting out the current storm to see whether or not it will  produce a markedly new political environment demanding new  strategies and tactics.  If the environment is changed to the  point where the MB can no longer function effectively, at least  some elements of the organization will certainly turn to more  radical activities.

He said that the DEA  informed him of the impending arrest just two or three days  before the arrest. The first arrests were made in Eugene,  Oregon. Then, Maj. Gen. Thanat was arrested in Hong Kong. The  two arrests were connected to each other. American officials  have confirmed that they have evidence. DEA officials asked for  our cooperation in arresting a Chinese Burmese named Mr. Lee.  Thai police officials arrested him on 9 December and extradited  him on 11 December. Most recently, DEA officials arrested the  sixth member of this gang in Oregon. None of those arrested  there were Thais.    The reporter asked if the DEA had identified any Thais as  being involved with this narcotics trafficking gang. Police Lt.  Gen. Kowit said that no such information has been provided. He  said that he had met with the head of the DEA in Thailand  earlier in the day and that they had talked about the Associated  Press report that a Thai police official was involved in this.  But the DEA official told him that they have no evidence to that  effect, unless the suspects implicate others.    The reporter asked if this arrest will tarnish Thailand's  image. Police Lt. Gen. Kowit said that this will have a good  effect, because it will show the world that Thailand is  cooperating and that we are sincere about wanting to suppress  narcotics. The United States has praised Thailand for this.    The reporter asked is the DEA had confirmed that no Thai  police officials or soldiers were involved. Police Lt. Gen.  Kowit said that none were involved. But that may not be so in  other cases, because nothing has happened yet. As far as this  case is concerned, Maj. Gen. Thanat has personal ties to Thais  living in Oregon. It's unlikely that others were involved. He  confirmed that there is strong evidence against Maj. Gen.  Thanat. He was not arrested as a scapegoat as some fear.    As the person responsible for overseeing the work of the  Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB), Mr. Amnuai  Wirawan, the deputy prime minister, said that the ONCB is doing  a good job. The arrest of a Thai general abroad has nothing to  do with the ONCB.    Mr. Amnuai said that with respect to statements by U.S.  officials that senior Thai military officers, police officials,  and civil servants are involved in narcotics trafficking  activities, the ONCB has frequently contacted international  organizations concerning suppression activities. It must be  admitted that there are some senior Thai officials who are  involved. But there are only a few such people. There are a few  bad people in every large organization. Steps must be taken to  get rid of the ""rotten fish."" ""I don't think that this news will  tarnish the image of Thai officials, because there are many good  people in the Thai bureaucracy. The Thai Government has  constantly helped other countries suppress narcotics. If  Thailand had not made those arrests, the damage would have been  much greater. The military has never tried to pull strings to  help one of its men.""    The reporter asked if the ONCB will coordinate things with  the United States and ask for the names of those senior [Thai]  officials said to be involved in narcotics trafficking  activities so that action can be taken against them. Mr. Amnuai  said that we have always cooperated with them. Thailand has  compiled a list of names, too, and some of the names appear on  both lists. Some of the names do not appear in the directory of  Thai officials but appear abroad. There is nothing unusual about  this.    Police General Prathin Santipraphop, the acting director  general of the Police Department, discussed the statement made  by General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, minister of interior, who said  that information provided by the DEA indicates that police  officers are involved in narcotics trafficking activities.  Police Gen. Prathin said that the Ministry of Interior has not  issued any instructions. If information is provided, the matter  must be investigated. The United States has not said who is on  the list. The only names that have been released are the names  of those who were arrested.    Lieutenant General Anuphap Songsunthon, the 2d Army Region  commander, said that the news that a major general has been  charged with trafficking in heroin is very disturbing. The Army  is a very large organization and so there are both good people  and bad people in it. But high-ranking officials should not be  involved in such things. Being involved in narcotics-trafficking  activities is a very serious matter. But what happened is a  personal matter. This has nothing to do with the military.    Second Lieutenant Phairot Suwannachawi, a National  Development Party member of Parliament from Nakhon Ratchasima  Province and an activist in Group 16, said that the units  concerned, that is, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ONCB,  and the Police Department, must provide clear and detailed  information to show if there are real grounds for charging a  general with being involved in heroin trafficking. Otherwise,  when senior Thai officials travel abroad, they may not be  treated with respect. He said that he once traveled abroad  together with a provincial governor and they were both stripped  and searched. This is a terrible matter. But this is a personal  matter that does not involve the military. He said that he hopes  that politicians and the mass media will think carefully before  saying anything or criticizing something.     "
0,FT932-7025 ,"FT932-7025 _AN-DEZCHAB9FT 930526   FT  26 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew outlines Ulster plan      By TIM COONE      DUBLIN   THE British government outlined its latest blueprint for the political structure of Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic's government in Dublin yesterday. But no new initiatives emerged from the ministerial meeting that might kick-start the stalled round-table political talks. It had been hoped that yesterday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference might give a fresh momentum to the talks process now that the province's local elections are over. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the UK government's proposals were still incomplete and would only be presented 'as and when the talks resume'. He said the British blueprint would not be 'an agreed paper between the two governments'. Mr Dick Spring, the republic's foreign minister, said he was satisfied that there would be further consultations between before the British paper was completed. The province's political parties abandoned negotiations last November without agreeing new political structures. The refusal by the hard-line Democratic Unionist party to sit at the table until the Irish Republic relinquishes its territorial claim to the province continues to be the main hurdle to further progress. Sir Patrick said yesterday that articles two and three of the Irish constitution, which set out the republic's territorial claim on the province, were 'a significant factor' blocking progress. Mr Spring reiterated his government's position that he would not accept preconditions and issued a plea to unionists. 'Why not come and talk?' he said. 'It doesn't help anybody to set out preconditions. We are available for dialogue.' Both ministers said they intend to initiate private meetings with the leaders of Northern Ireland's main political parties in an attempt to establish the basis for fresh talks. Sir Patrick welcomed the moves by the republic to amend extradition legislation 'to close loopholes that have recently been opened up by judicial decisions'. The question of internment, demanded by unionist leaders in the wake of the IRA's latest bombing offensive in Northern Ireland, was not discussed.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Amnesty also specifies that the  repression affects not just the Islamists, but also the  government's detractors, notably members of the banned Communist  Party. There has been an immediate reaction from the  authorities refuting [these allegations] en bloc. Listen to  Secretary of State for Information Fathi Houidi, speaking to  Rida Boughezi:    [Begin Houidi recording] This is in complete contradiction  with the real situation experienced by Tunisians in an open,  tolerant country, where respect for human rights derives from a  free political choice which is reasoned and open to change. I  want to point out, in any case, that Amnesty's choice of a date  to publish this new report on Tunisia has not been made without  ulterior motives. It comes at a time when the country is  preparing for free elections, organised after an amendment of  the electoral law, which guarantees political pluralism within  the parliament, and at a time when an exceptional revision of  the electoral lists -- hailed by observers and the opposition  parties -- has just been made, and finally at a time when  Tunisia's success is being cited here, there and everywhere as  an example. It is this precise moment which Amnesty has chosen  to bring out this report and this communique, in which, in my  view, prejudice competes with an intention to wreak harm. We  knew that Amnesty had reached a point where it was not very  careful of the truth; we were not so aware that it had also  become so extensively manipulated by the fundamentalists,  because it is doing nothing other than embracing their ideas and  adopting all their arguments, which are false.

In its monthly report the HRC said violence in  KwaZulu/Natal had continued to drop, with the May death toll of  104 the lowest recorded since January 1993.    Despite ongoing tensions in the area, the declining death  toll supported the HRC's repeated calls for the lifting of the  state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal, the HRC said. The 195  deaths in May were considerably lower than the 1994 monthly  average of 365 and the 1993 monthly average of 367.    There were 73 deaths in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging], 104 in Natal, and 18 elsewhere, bringing the year  total to 1,826.    Of the 195 victims, ten were women and five children. Two  white civilians were among those killed in May.    The 226 incidents of violence in May represented a 65  percent  decrease from the April figure of 649. This low level of  violence had not been experienced since January 1993, the HRC  said.    Only one ""major massacre"" took place in May -- the  execution-style killing of 12 people in Thokoza, linked to  fighting between Self-Defence Units in Katlehong.    The right wing, with no deaths attributed to it in May,  appeared to have been neutralised after it caused 24 deaths and  184 injuries during its bombing campaign in April.    Taxi violence, with 14 deaths, increased for the third month  in succession.    On human rights, the HRC recorded declining figures in  detentions without trial, deaths in police custody and political  arrests.    It reported as a violation of the freedom of assembly the  order circulated by Eastern Cape Premier Raymond Mhlaba banning  civil servants in the province from going on strike.     "

""Sander! Sander! Sander!"" they chanted.    Frangaj, who had been in prison for a month awaiting trial  for exposing state secrets, held up two fingers in a V. This  victory gesture was often flashed in 1991, during the elections  that toppled the Communist government and brought the ruling  Democratic Party to power. But now, instead of a sign of  allegiance, it was a symbol of ridicule.    After communism in Albania fell in 1991, the groundwork for  a  free press seemed to take hold. Three years after the Democratic  Party swept into power, however, journalists complain they are  once again feeling the symptoms of dictatorship.    Last October, the government passed a controversial press  law  that imposes high fines on offending journalists. Reporters and  editors have also been punished under the country's recently  amended penal code from 1977. Additionally, many journalists  tell tales of harassment and even beatings after publishing  critical reports on the government.    Frangaj was arrested after a reporter at his newspaper, KOHA  JONE (OUR TIME), wrote that soldiers would be required to leave  their weapons in the barracks when off-duty. The information was  allegedly obtained from a top-secret Ministry of Defense  document that a ministry official pilfered and released to the  newspaper.    The crowd that gathered after Frangaj's court appearance  consisted mainly of fellow journalists who had come to express  their solidarity with the accused and protest the increasing  pressure being brought to bear on journalists.    So far this year, a dozen reports of Albanian journalists  being arrested, beaten or harassed have surfaced. Six media  watchdog organizations -- the International Federation of  Newspaper Publishers, the International Federation of  Journalists, Reporters sans Frontiers, the Balkan Federation of  Journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists and Article 19  -- have sent protests to Albanian President Sali Berisha against  the arrests of Frangaj and his reporter, Martin Leka.    Frangaj, who was acquitted of the same charge last year  after  reporting on tank movements near Albania's northern border with  Yugoslavia, was found innocent again this time. But the court  sentenced Leka to 18 months in prison for ""collaborating to  release state secrets,"" the harshest punishment against a  journalist since communism fell.    The press in Albania is reeling from nearly 50 years of the  most hardline rule in Europe.    Partly as a result of its past, most of Albania's main  newspapers are mouthpieces of various political parties and are  filled with propaganda and party polemics. Radio and television  are still state-controlled. There are many independent papers,  but they too are politicized and seldom separate opinion from  fact.    Government officials say the press law was necessary to  regulate a press that, they claim, is slanderous and  unprofessional.    ""In the papers I have been married several times and have  kids, villas and property all over,"" said Edward Salemi, chair  of the ruling Democratic Party. He is single and lives in a  Tirana apartment.    Even though the Albanian Helsinki Committee has issued  protests against the treatment of journalists, assistant  director Kutim Casko complains about the press as well.    ""Journalists don't have an awareness for the sacred mission  they must do,"" he said. ""Instead, they have become the  politicized victims of party politics. They terrorize people.""    At the time of passage, the widely contested press law  provoked a 48-hour strike by many of Albania's leading papers,  which printed only their mastheads, leaving their pages blank.  Numerous international organizations lodged protests.    Ironically, however, it is the 1977 penal code, which has  gone largely unchallenged, that has most gravely affected  journalists.    The law, drafted under the late Communist dictator Enver  Hoxha, was used by officials to arrest Frangaj and Leka. At  least three others are now under arrest and awaiting trial for  alleged violations of the law.    Illyrian Zhupa, editor in chief of the independent  opposition  paper POPULLI PO (PEOPLE'S YES), was arrested for slander  February 9, after the newspaper ran an investigation of a  scandal that Zhupa said implicated ""several key figures in the  government.""    Zhupa, whose trial date has not yet been set, also complains  that his offices have been broken into and documents have been  stolen.    ""It's too early for a free press in Albania,"" he said.    The staff at the newspaper of the main opposition party, the  Socialists, also complain about the pressure they have come  under.    In January, a worker named Luftetar Matohiti from the  industrial city of Elbasan wrote a letter to ZERI I POPULLIT  (THE PEOPLE'S VOICE) criticizing the government and reminding  President Berisha of the time in the 1920s when a man became a  national hero for killing an Albanian ruler. This was considered  an insult to the president, and Matohiti was sentenced to two  months in Tirana Prison.    ZERI I POPULLIT's second-highest editor, Shyqyri Meka, was  fined $1,000 US for publishing an article that was critical of  the ""upper organs of the state.""    After his colleagues at KOHA JONE were arrested, Gjergj  Zefi,  deputy editor of the ALEANCA (ALLIANCE), wrote an article the  next day protesting the arrests and calling the government a  ""mafia band.""    ""The government has decided to attack all of its political  opponents. This speaks of a mentally sick state. That is the  only way to explain the arrests of the two journalists,"" he  wrote February 1.    After his article was published, Zefi was placed under city  arrest for criticizing upper organs of the state. He was allowed  to travel only from his hometown of Skodra, in northern Albania,  to his office in Tirana.    March 2, just a few days after his colleague Leka was  sentenced, Zefi was found lying unconscious in the street in  Skodra, after having been clubbed on the head. Zefi, who is also  vice chair of the Democratic Alliance (a splinter group of the  ruling Democratic Party) had written several articles about  alleged smuggling of oil by local mafia into the former  Yugoslavia in defiance of the UN embargo.    Zefi also organized a meeting of the Democratic Alliance in  January, after which a gunman, firing into the crowd outside the  building, killed one party member. No suspect was ever  apprehended, although Democratic Alliance members claim they  know who did the shooting.    Zefi had been the editor of the now-defunct LAJMETARI, based  in Skodra. His predecessor at the paper was clubbed in the same  way last year after reporting on the alleged mafia, and has  since left the country.    Arben Imami, general secretary of the Democratic Alliance,  said journalists at his paper are scared.    ""We have survived so much -- you know, 50 years of a  totalitarian regime, a press law, a penal code -- but now there  is a real danger of being eliminated, physically eliminated, and  law-enforcement authorities are not doing anything about it,""  said Imami. ""We are facing a new period.""    The attacks on Zefi and his predecessor are not the only  cases of violence against journalists.    Last month, while trying to verify the charges against  Frangaj and Leka, a journalist who reports for the cable  television station WTN was punched in the face at the Tirana  Prosecutor's Office.    In early January, a knife-wielding visitor lunged at Apollo  Bace, a journalist for the independent paper DITA INFORMACION  (INFORMATION OF THE DAY), when Bace answered his door. Bace said  a cigarette lighter in his pocket saved him from injury.    That attack followed several articles Bace wrote about the  Church of Scientology, as well as an article criticizing  President Berisha DITA INFORMACION had run several days earlier.    The Association of Professional Journalists in Albania has  lodged a protest against the attempted stabbing, and has  appealed to the Albanian authorities to apprehend and punish  those who attack journalists.    Albania's press law, based on a German press law from  Rhineland-Westphalia, imposes fines on journalists ranging from  $1,000 to $8,000 US. In a conference organized by the  Friedrich-Ebert Foundation, which prepared the law for Albania,  German media lawyer Kurt Braun defended the law, but said the  fines were excessive in a country where journalists earn on  average the equivalent of $40 US per month.    Braun also questioned whether Albania had the appropriate  legal framework to ensure proper implementation of the law.    ""This law leaves much open to misapplication,"" he said,  pointing out Albania's lack of a constitution and its  inexperienced judiciary.    Marcus Jaeger, a European Community lawyer, said, ""If the  Albanian public could be sure there would be competent judges,  there would be much less fear of new laws.""    ""I think it's better to have a bad press law than to be  without a law,"" said Beqir Skreli, a reporter at ZERI I  POPULLIT. ""The problem is putting this law into practice.  We...are fined, while the journalists at RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE  [DEMOCRATIC REBIRTH, the daily of the ruling Democratic Party]  haven't been cited for a single case,"" he said. ""The knife has  two edges. So far it has shown only one -- against the  opposition.""     "

In a statement to news organisations in Cairo the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, or Islamic Groups, said it did 'not target the innocent' and that Sheikh Abdul-Rahman had 'no connection' with the February 26 attack. The message added the warning that 'any defamation touching on Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman will not pass peacefully'. Mr Mohammed Salameh, the 26-year-old Jordanian national accused of being an accomplice in the bombing, was said to have prayed at a New Jersey mosque at which Sheikh Abdul-Rahman preached. But yesterday in New York Mr Salameh's lawyer also repudiated links between his client and the Egyptian cleric. The underground Gama'a al-Islamiyya has led recent attacks against foreign visitors to Egypt, though the group claims to be attacking 'tourism not tourists'. Three visitors and one Egyptian have been killed in the attacks. The same group has warned foreigners to leave Egypt and warned that it might attack foreign investments in the country. A Cairo military court will today open the trial of 49 alleged members of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya accused of leading the attacks. Maj Gen Mohammed Abdallah, military prosecutor general, said charges would include intention to kill, possession of arms and explosives and economic sabotage. Six of the named defendants, who are among hundreds and perhaps thousands rounded up by Egypt's security forces since the attacks began last year, are being charged in absentia. Those found guilty face the death penalty. Separately, Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, said that Sheikh Abdul-Rahman would face charges for incitement to violence and terrorism should he be deported to Egypt from the US. Deportation proceedings against the sheikh by New Jersey immigration authorities have been deferred.   Countries:-  EGZ  Egypt, Africa.   Industries:-  P8661 Religious Organizations.

Roberto Villalta, who was wearing his work uniform, Gerardo  Calderon, Patricio Esparza, and another unidentified person were  taken into custody in the operation.    Residents of Bolivia Street, El Barreal neighborhood,  reported seeing policemen and Public Security and Transportation  vehicles constantly arriving at a warehouse where the PJF later  seized the marijuana. The PJF said it seized 606.84 kg of  cannabis and two scales used to package the drug.

The police said they will continue their investigations and  hope to make several arrests in connection with the bust.    In a related story, the Attorney General's office destroyed  two plantations in Sinaloa and Baja California estimated to  cover 20,000 square meters. The plantations, located during  several reconnaissance flights, were believed to hold 210,000  marijuana plants.    The first plantation was discovered in a ranching area known  as Las Playitas, Sinaloa de Leyva Municipality. Several PJF  units converged on the area and destroyed marijuana plants and  heroin poppies growing on 3.5 square meters.    Meanwhile, a 15 square-meter marijuana plantation was found  and destroyed near Rewal del Castillo Viejo and Enecua along the  Ojos Negros Highway, Encenada, Baja California.

0,FT931-14483 ,"FT931-14483 _AN-DARCMADSFT 930118   FT  18 JAN 93 / The world's no-win zones      By IAN DAVIDSON   The jury is still out over what exactly was achieved by last week's air strike against military installations in Iraq. Taking out only half the targets does not seem a particularly impressive achievement. The more important question is, what did it achieve in strategic terms; or even, what was it meant to achieve in strategic terms? The 'new world order', which was supposed to be coming soon after the Gulf war two years ago, is still obviously a long way off. Released from the icy grip of the cold war, the international community is trying to do more than in the past about some of the wrongs of the world. The problem is that world-ordering is just as intractable as ever. In Iraq, the west seems to be stuck with an ambiguous strategy that fails to reconcile conflicting objectives. In the former Yugoslavia, it is hoping against hope that the civil war can be brought to an end through trade sanctions and diplomatic negotiations, because no one wants to accept the alternative of military intervention on the ground. Last week's air strike against Iraq was ostensibly to enforce the no-fly zone south of the 32nd parallel. Yet the reasons for this no-fly zone have by now become blurred. It was originally imposed to hamper Saddam Hussein's repression of the Shias in the south. In reality such repression would mainly be carried out by land forces; an air exclusion zone could not have much effect. So is it now really being maintained to limit Baghdad's ability to threaten Kuwait and the rest of the Gulf? To weaken his position at home? Or what? In any case, Saddam showed last week that he can easily stick the outside world with the inherent contradiction between the UN's no-fly zone and its need for freedom to fly its arms inspectors anywhere. Since the air attack, he has said he would stop obstructing the arms inspectors; but it is obvious that this bombing raid, as with other bombing raids, is not a durable solution to anything, because it cannot be. The situation in the former Yugoslavia is much worse. An apparent change of heart by the Bosnian Serbs last Tuesday gave an unexpected reprieve to the peace talks in Geneva; Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said he accepted the constitutional plan put forward by Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, and undertook to try to sell it to his own supporters. Having conquered so much of the territory of Bosnia, many Bosnian Serbs will want to reject the plan. But if their answer is yes, then we shall face the moment of truth. For the next stage in the negotiations would be the allocation of territory to the various warring factions - Serbs, Moslems and Croatians - and that is where the briar patch gets really thorny. The patchwork of 10 quasi-autonomous provinces, proposed by Mr Vance and Lord Owen, is an inherently bizarre recipe of contradictory principles. Poised uneasily on the cusp between autonomy for the (ethnically-based) provinces and the legitimacy of the state, it can hardly avoid rolling one way or another, almost certainly towards disintegration and the effective expansion of greater Serbia. In principle, the plan concedes far too much to ethnic cleansing and territorial conquest, which are widely condemned. An even more serious problem in practice is that the Vance-Owen map would require the Bosnian Serbs to surrender a substantial proportion of the territory that they now effectively control. If the Serbs do not agree to surrender the territory, the west will have an interesting choice: either to let them keep what they have conquered, in which case these negotiations will merely have served to endorse the Serbian aggression and savagery; or else to make them conform to the Vance-Owen map, which would mean a credible threat to deploy substantial international forces on the ground. No prizes are offered for guessing the likely outcome, since western governments are horrified at the idea of getting involved in this dirty civil war. Aspirations for a better world order will not disappear. The Gulf war was a one-off event, unique in its black-and-white simplicity, unsatisfactory in its political outcome and irrelevant to other situations. Yet that UN performance set a precedent which continues to influence the mind-sets of the members of the Security Council. It may be exceedingly difficult to reproduce that precedent, however. First, the US may be less politically inclined to take on the essential leadership role. We do not yet know just how President Clinton will respond to the latest spasm in the Iraqi crisis. But his election platform, with its clear priority for domestic issues, suggests that he would be less likely than Mr Bush to play the role of the global policeman. In any case, the Gulf war already showed that the US can no longer afford to exercise this role alone. The shrinking of US finances, and then of US forces, mean that the growing demands for UN peacekeeping can only be met in future if the Europeans are prepared to share the leadership and the costs. In this context 'Europeans' means more than just Britain and France: it means the Germans must play their part as well. The fact that the German Social Democrats have blocked any easing of the limitation on the use of German military force is a serious setback for the prospect of UN peacekeeping.

Ever since several political parties have been functioning  in  Macedonian political life, some of the parties have been  constantly obsessed with the police. The parties try to  interpret in their own way any significant action by the police.  The national parties in the Macedonian bloc, especially  VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic Party of Macedonian National Unity], are  ""diligent"" in this regard, as well as the Albanians' parties,  the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] and the NDP [National  Democratic Party]. In the past they have frequently demanded the  resignation of the minister of internal affairs. Is it just  because Macedonia is in a period of transition, because of the  incomplete transformation of the police, or because of the  stance of the parties which represent ""their people"" that we  have so many incidents, and scandals, behind us? Or, to put it  more simply, are political circles trying to clarify police  actions that have already been carried out?    Radolista, the Bit Market, the ""All-Albanian Army,"" then  Djordje Petrov, Kuklis, the Veles trial, Blue Bird, Duvlo, and  finally, Kuceviste, and so forth, are cases of action by the  police that were interpreted differently by the parties, and  after which there were demands that the head of the police be  held accountable. The issue of exceeding authority was always  raised.    When One Has the Same Standard...    When 860 policemen entered the village of Radoliste in 1992,  on the basis of previous indications about the possible  organization of paramilitary formations, the police were fired  upon from several directions and from several houses. Even  before this operation, the police had discovered in the same  village, in one development in Struga, as well as in Feriste,  eight rifles (four automatic rifles and one sniper rifle), 12  pistols, ammunition, 1.6 kilograms of explosives, capsules and  slow-burning fuses, 12 gas masks, five pairs of binoculars, and  two camouflage uniforms, and 33 people were arrested, three of  whom were Albanian citizens. The police thus had grounds for  suspicion. The PDP, however, is speaking out in connection with  the case, demanding information about the incident, and noting  that the increased police presence is unjustified; the entire  course of events is being focused on what has already been  heard--that the police are conducting operations to intimidate  and put pressure on the Albanians, and trying to portray them as  terrorists, and in this context, they are allegedly trying to  portray the PDP that way as well.    Precisely these words were uttered recently when the police  arrested several Albanians who were found to be in illegal  possession of weapons. The charges filed refer to article 218 of  the Criminal Code--the illegal possession of weapons and  explosives. That in itself indicates that the latest arrests do  not have any connection (at least not according to the  statements made to date) with the arrest of the people accused  of Albanian paramilitary organization and of the creation of an  All-Albanian Army in Macedonia. The PDP and NDP, however, are  insisting precisely on that connection, and they are trying to  politicize the trial and portray it as a political one. The  Albanian deputies in the Tetovo Assembly are even putting the  latest case on the agenda (!), demanding that the people  arrested be released! Is this a matter of hasty conclusions,  pressure upon the Interior Ministry for more selective actions,  or even an attempt to persuade international factors that the  Albanians in Macedonia are, allegedly, in danger?    In the past, however, other citizens have also been held  accountable under that same article 218, and not just Albanians.    In that same year, 1992, Krum Cuskov and his son Goce  Cuskov,  as well as Djordji Kalauzarov and Petre Konevski (all from Titov  Veles) and Zarko Petrusev and Stojce Delevski from Tetovo, were  jailed because of grounds to suspect that they had committed a  crime under the same article 218. The defendants from Titov  Veles were charged with nine explosions that took place in the  city from 1989 to April 1992. The two defendants from Tetovo,  along with the Veles group, were planning to blow up the PDP and  NDP headquarters in Tetovo. It was precisely in order to prevent  that planned bombing that the police stopped pretending that  they were ""naive,"" in order to ""close the net"" around other  ""bombers"" who were possibly involved. (Two more people were  later arrested, however.) The court later sentenced them to  prison. The ""bombers"" were members of VMRO-DPMNE, and Kalauzarov  was even secretary of the municipal committee. The party  disassociated itself from the defendants, while nevertheless not  neglecting to say that it was an action at the wrong time and in  the wrong place. Then, however, ""chief"" Nikola Veljanovski from  Ohrid was to say that the people involved in the Veles trial  were members of VMRO's Defense Committee, which had also issued  a death sentence against VMRO-DPMNE leader Ljupco Georgievski.    A few months ago, an individual who had ""several weapons""  was  arrested at the Tetovo bus station. The defendant was a Serb by  nationality. That time the PDP and NDP kept quiet.    Should the Police ""Boast""?    The police can also ""boast"" of their actions in the Bit  Market, when there was an armed conflict with a large number of  Albanian citizens; of their supervision of a number of suspects  in the Albanians' rally in the Skopje square, when a map of ""the  political and territorial autonomy of Albanians in Macedonia""  was presented, and when the propaganda material that several  citizens, who turned out to be relatives of deputy Mersim  Polozani, brought with them to Skopje, was controlled without  the use of force.    The police can likewise boast of the better-known actions in  Kuklis, when the VMRO-DPMNE went into the field with its  prominent representatives, or in Djorce Petrov, when ""the  people"" came out again, and the police utilized repression, a  case which was likewise politicized by the Macedonian national  parties. Skopje's Montenegro, or more precisely the village of  Kuceviste, is a place where there have been incidents with the  police several times to date, in which the participants were  citizens who were Serbs by nationality. The Democratic Party of  Serbs in Macedonia was the political factor which politicized  the incidents and spread ideas about the Serbophobia of the  Interior Ministry and the police's alleged ethnic selectivity  along those lines.    The ""Blue Bird"" scandal considerably disturbed the public  two  years ago. VMRO-DPMNE responded that ""The SDB [State Security  Service] is using the perfidious insinuations of members of the  party in order to discredit it and compromise it in the eyes of  the public,"" and that ""The members' ethnic identity is being  misused."" The resignations of state President Kiro Gligorov and  Minister Ljubomir Frckovski were demanded, and it was also  demanded that the government be held responsible. It actually  had to do with a decision by VMRO-DPMNE's External Commission to  form an ethnic army (the MNG [Macedonian National Guard] or  guard), whose representatives were received at a high level in  the Republic of Bulgaria, where assistance in the form of a  10,000-strong army and special forces was promised. VMRO-DPMNE  was informed, and the ""guardsmen"" swore their oaths in a church  in Kuklis. The MNG's statute specified action only in the event  of foreign aggression against Macedonia. The period of the MNG's  creation coincided with the time of the withdrawal by the JNA  [Yugoslav People's Army] from Macedonia (15 April 1992) and the  establishment of the ARM [Army of the Republic of Macedonia].  Then contacts with the SDB and the ARM took place. There was no  criminal prosecution of the ""paramilitary troops,"" since, as  Interior Ministry Under Secretary Slobodan Bogoevski stated  then, ""the guardsmen have resigned, they did not commit a crime,  there is no basis for criminal charges,"" and ""The SDB was  obligated to accept the contacts that were offered.""    Perhaps the unclear and ""semi-informative"" scandal will go  down in the young state's history as a good-faith attempt by a  ""group of patriots"" to fight for its independent, but the case  has been profoundly politicized by VMRO-DPMNE. The fact that its  closure happened from the moment of the ARM's formation cannot  give the incident the same dimensions as the case of the  ""All-Albanian Army,"" which is just being clarified. According to  the indictment, this has to do with actions that continued even  after the JNA's departure from Macedonia, while possible actions  during the JNA's presence are, in general, a mitigating  circumstance. The statements by local national leaders from  Bitola and Ohrid about the alleged ""thousands of armed patriots""  (paramilitary ones) are nothing more than advertising, at least  according to official statements.    What is surely the essential thing, and a disturbing one at  the same time, is that the idea that the police are against the  people, or against the people ""represented by"" certain parties,  is still being encouraged. If one goes by the reactions of the  political parties, it turns out that the Interior Ministry  authorities exist only for themselves, but are also against all  citizens (depending on ethnic identity) in Macedonia.    Nevertheless, it is that way throughout the world--when  public law and order is threatened security measures are taken,  when necessary by means of repression as well. The illegal  possession of weapons and explosives is punished, and everywhere  terrorist actions have the same name and require sanctions.  Different views are discussed, and any abuse of power is  determined by the competent authorities.     "

However, the final decision lay with the foreign ministry, he said on radio. Last night the ambassador, Mr Habi Soleiman Pour, was called to the ministry but made no comment afterwards. Judge Juan Jose Galeano, on Tuesday night, accused seven Iranians - four former and three current diplomats at Iran's embassy in Buenos Aires - of having participated in both the bombing of the centre, which claimed 96 lives, and an attack on the Israeli embassy in Argentina, which killed 30 in 1992. Mr Galeano also charged three Argentinians who are claimed to have unwittingly reconditioned and sold the van used in the bombing. He accused them of having used stolen car parts. One of those charged, Mr Ariel Nitzcaner, is Jewish and a member of the bombed community centre. He claims police tortured him to extract information. Judge Galeano sent a preliminary report, late on Tuesday, to the Supreme Court requesting it demand that the three current diplomats have their immunity from prosecution waived. Iran's foreign ministry yesterday protested over the arrest warrants to Argentina's charge d'affaires in Tehran. Argentina could take diplomatic action against Tehran if officials refused to co-operate, Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, said. The government would first request that the suspects 'appear as witnesses, abandon their immunity, and only then, if they refuse, would we take measures.' Possible action includes declaring the diplomats persona non grata and ordering a reduction in embassy staff. Officials said cutting diplomatic relations with Iran would only be appropriate if investigators established Tehran's direct responsibility in the bombing. However, a European diplomat said: 'Argentina is right that there may well be Iranian involvement but whether they really have enough to prove a case in court is another question.'

According to this source, there was gunfire during the  incident. The armed men, who are being sought, left weapons  including three M- 1 rifles and ammunition in the area. The  incident took place near the village of Chantal near Les Cayes,  some 200 km southwest of Port-au-Prince.    Three Haitians from the diaspora, who had clandestinely  reentered the country, were training young people of the region  in the rural section of Le Pretre when they were discovered by a  reconnaissance patrol acting on a tip, which then turned into a  combat patrol, according to the same source. No Army personnel  were wounded. There is no information about casualties among the  opposing group.    The plan to train for armed struggle is part of Operation  Iron Cuts Iron aimed at liberating the country, which was  announced by President Aristide from Washington in a New Year's  message to Haitians, this source explained. In order to thwart  this plan and maintain order, search operations were recently  launched by the Army in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area  where six weapons, including two with telescopic lenses, were  seized and arrests made, this military source pointed out. He  added that the situation in Les Cayes, where similar incidents  have taken place since Aristide went into exile in 1991, was  totally under the control of the local military command.    Furthermore, the same source said that the fire that  destroyed oil products clandestinely stored in a low-income  neighborhood of Port-au-Prince on the night of 12 February might  be the act of a criminal hand to raise fuel prices and  exacerbate the crisis.

But the Security Council is unlikely to approve the Libyan proposal, which was offered through the Arab League, the diplomats said. 'The latest proposal is to turn them over to Malta, to postpone sanctions and hold negotiations,' Venezuelan Ambassador Diego Arria said. 'But I don't think it will fly,' he said. He described the Libyan offer 'as a dilatory tactic to endlessly postpone sanctions.' There was no word whether Malta would accept the proposal and take custody of the two men. The US and Britain are demanding that the two suspects be handed over for trial in the west, but do not object if intermediaries are involved. Mr Arria said that Libya also had asked him whether Venezuela might be willing to take custody of the men. But the Caracas government had refused to do this, he said. Tony Walker adds from Cairo: Libya last night urged its Arab neighbours to disregard the UN sanctions, which are due to take effect at a minute after midnight New York time tomorrow. after Libya's refusal to hand over two men accused of the 1988 bombing of a US airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, Tony Walker reports. Major Abdel-Salam Jalloud, Libya's second-in-command, bluntly told Arab labour ministers in Tripoli, that 'the Arabs should not implement resolution 748'. It was Libya's most pointed call to its fellow Arabs to ignore the UN sanctions resolution, which calls for an air and arms embargo, and a downgrading of Libyan representation abroad. Libyan prepared for the sanctions deadline by declaring a day of 'mourning' today, during which communications with the west were cut off, against a background of continuing and apparently futile Arab diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis.

The explosion, condemned by politicians, came as Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd, in an interview conducted before the  Christmas break, appealed to the IRA to stop prevaricating over  the British-Irish joint declaration -- and to lay down their  arms forever.

The blast, within the compound of the police station in the  remote Co Tyrone village of Fintona, injured a man and a women  and caused widespread damage to the base and surrounding homes.    It came in clear defiance of appeals by the Queen,  politicians and churchmen for the violence to end, and it  destroyed the hopes of war-weary Ulster people that the  ""ceasefire"" would continue as a truce while the IRA considered  its response to the declaration.    But hopes were not completely dashed either in London or  Dublin where it was always realised that the IRA high command  had a tough job on its hands to convince followers of the need  to end the violence. Nevertheless, there is growing irritation  in both governments that the Provisionals have given not the  slightest indication yet that they will cooperate and enable  Sinn Fein eventually to take part in talks about the future of  the Province.

Mr Selim Sadak, MP for Sirnak in Turkey's Kurdish heartland, writing to the interior minister, Mr Nahit Mentese, demanded a government investigation of allegations of bombing by Turkish military aircraft of Kurdish villages in which he claimed at least 48 people were killed. The government said earlier that a bomb had been dropped by accident. The incident underscores the violent escalation in the fighting, with more than 4,000 guerrillas, soldiers and civilians killed in the past year. The UN, contacted in Baghdad yesterday, confirmed that around 800 families were being given temporary shelter and food near the border town of Zakho, complaining of harassment by Turkish troops. The Turkish government has dismissed the situation as a PKK propaganda ploy. Foreign ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman vehemently denied eyewitness reports that villages were being deliberately targeted by security forces. The PKK has increased attacks against targets in western Turkey in recent months, including the killing of five off-duty Turkish army conscripts in Istanbul. This, more than any other recent incident, has inflamed public opinion against the Kurds. The intensified conflict is causing concern in western capitals. The German foreign minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, in a German magazine last week, said the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should convene a conference on the Kurdish problem. Scandinavian countries have more than once called for CSCE monitors to go to the south-east. For the first time, the US is calling on Turkey, its Nato ally, to find a political solution to the problem of the 10m-strong Kurdish minority. However, in the wake of recent escalations in the violence, Mrs Tansu Ciller's government has hardened its view, abandoning the political initiative to win over moderate Kurds by democratic reforms.

0,FT933-15901 ,"FT933-15901 _AN-DGGB8AAOFT 930707   FT  07 JUL 93 / The infection deep inside Italy's health ministry: Haig Simonian dissects the latest stream of corruption revelations      By HAIG SIMONIAN   THE stream of revelations about corruption in Italy's ministry of health suggests health was at least as lucrative an activity for Italian politicians as telephones and transport - two of the main areas of corruption revealed so far. The investigations have triggered the arrest of a string of leading executives from the pharmaceuticals, advertising and public relations sectors. They have tarnished the reputations of some of Italy's top medical men and already caused one probable suicide. At the root of the investigations are Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the former health minister, who resigned in February after being accused of running a jobs-for-votes scam in his native Naples, and Mr Giovanni Marone, his ex-secretary. Mr De Lorenzo, for whom magistrates have asked that his parliamentary immunity be lifted, has pleaded innocence. Mr Marone, arrested earlier this year, has sung like a bird. So far, his testimony, widely leaked by magistrates, has cut a swathe through the medical and pharmaceuticals establishment, taking a good swipe at advertising and PR on the way. The impact of the allegations is that the ministry and some of its top officials were open to financial incentives for a variety of favours. Magistrates have arrested Mr Ambrogio Secondi and Mr Cristiano Steigler, chairman and managing director of the Italian subsidiary of SmithKline Beecham, the multinational pharmaceuticals group. Other arrests include Mr Giampaolo Zambeletti, the former owner and managing director of one of Italy's leading independent pharmaceuticals companies, and Mr Claudio Cavazza, chairman of Sigma Tau, another leading independent pharmaceuticals group. Mr Secondi is also chairman of the industry association, while Mr Cavazza is a former chairman. The latest arrests take to double figures the number of leading drug company executives arrested in the past fortnight. Others include Mr Andrea Montececchi of Schiapparelli and Mr Paolo Raimondo of Zambon. Mr Zambeletti, accused of making illegal contributions to political parties, allegedly paid L600m (Pounds 235,750) to an advertising agency for fictitious services. The money in fact went to finance the election campaign of the small Liberal party, of which Mr De Lorenzo is a leading member. Mr Secondi and Mr Steigler have also been arrested regarding allegedly illegal contributions. They are accused of giving Mr Marone L600m to a speed up approval procedures and influence pricing policy. This week, the plot thickened with the arrest of Mr Elio Guido Rondanelli, one of Italy's best-known medical academics, and the issue of cautionary warrants against Mr Duilio Poggiolini and Mr Francesco Antonio Manzoli, two leading medical academics closely linked with the health ministry. All three men also sat on Italy's independent pharmaceuticals pricing advisory committee, which reports directly to the ministry on the sensitive issue of drug prices. According to the magistrates' allegations, some committee members received kickbacks from drugs companies to influence their decisions. Last month, a morbid twist was added to the tale with the mysterious death, believed to be suicide, in Naples of Mr Antonio Vittoria, chairman of the pharmacy faculty at Naples university and a committee member. However, the allegations about the health ministry go much further than drugs, reflecting the fact that its edict covers a range of other, less obvious sources, of patronage. Last week, police arrested Mr Carlo Violati, the former chairman of the Ferrarelle mineral water company, on charges of making illegal political contributions. Mr Violati allegedly paid L200m to Mr Marone to speed up analytical work by the ministry. Italy is the world's biggest mineral water market, and brands compete fiercely on a variety of factors, including the 'healthiness' of their products. The allegations against Mr Violati has already led to suggestions that other entrepreneurs may also have sought to accelerate the ministry's activities. The investigations into the ministry have also broken new ground in that they for the first time in the corruption scandal involve third parties, such as advertising agencies and big PR companies. According to Mr Italo Ghitti, one of the Milanese magistrates closely involved in the investigations: 'Not only did some agencies pay kickbacks, but they also lent themselves as channels for kickbacks to be paid.' Magistrates yesterday arrested Mr Claudio Masi di Vargas Macciucca, managing director in Italy of the FCB Mac/Publicis advertising agency. The arrest followed the detention last month of Mr Alessandro Incecchi, a former managing director of the Young  Rubicam advertising agency in Italy, and Mr Marcello Di Tondo, an executive of the Burston Marsteller group. Mr Di Tondo's arrest is believed to concern allegations over the health ministry's big anti-Aids campaign - the same issue that prompted the arrest last month of Mr Aldo Brancher, an executive of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest media group. Mr Brancher, a lobbyist for Fininvest and assistant to Mr Fedele Confalonieri, its managing director, allegedly paid Mr Marone L300m in kickbacks on a television advertising contract during the anti-Aids campaign. According to normally reliable leaked testimony, Mr Brancher, who is still in jail, has claimed he was acting in a private capacity on behalf of his own company rather than Fininvest.

The bill for  the cleanup operation will be staggering.    Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are currently sizing up the  fallout from 50 years of sloppiness at more than 1,000 former  Soviet military facilities. This legacy of Soviet rule, ranging  from nuclear waste to water pollution, should keep policy  planners and eco-businesses busy for years.    Soviet pilots, for instance, would regularly dump jet fuel  on  the ground to minimise flying hours. At the Tapa military air  base in Estonia, 16 sq km are polluted by jet fuel, 7 meters  deep in some places.    At most Soviet airfields in the Baltic region -- as in east  Germany and the Czech Republic -- waste fuel, while not toxic,  has seeped into the region's shallow natural groundwater  reserves and raised purification costs.    The World Bank has examined the damage at Latvia's Tukums  air  force base, and is considering funding cleanup programmes.  Environment Canada, a government agency, has offered to train  Latvians in site remediation and assessment. But institutional  lenders have yet to commit substantial funds to cleanup efforts.    Meanwhile Baltec, a private Latvian company, has begun a  bioremediation project at Tukums. Over five years, it plans to  pump out the jet fuel, some of which can be salvaged and resold,  and put bacteria into the soil to break down the remaining fuel.    Inspectors previously barred from secret sites are finding  other and more worrying surprises. Near Zvarde, an eastern  Latvian town, more than 24,000 hectares of farmland were  confiscated for air target practice. The land was returned to  Latvia after independence, leaving a trail of pollution,  deforestation and unexploded bombs after 30 years of daily  bombing sorties.    Peteris Elfers, a member of parliament, estimates that  demining might take another 30 years. ""It has to be done,"" he  says, ""but we don't have the technology to do it well."" An  inspection last summer found 364 bombs, mines and rockets after  examining just the main bombing polygon of 159 hectares -- and  only cursorily to a depth of 20 cm.    Deadly waste understandably raises more eyebrows. In  Sillamae, a closed military city on Estonia's north-eastern  coast, a classified chemical combine has left a 20 meter high  dam that contains, according to Murray Feshbach, an expert on  the Soviet environment at Georgetown University in the U.S., 4  million tonnes of uranium ore, 1,200 tonnes of pure uranium,  1,000 tonnes of radium, 800 tonnes of thorium, plus 2 million  tonnes of calcium sulphide oil shale ash and some ground  radioactivity.    In a big storm, this could go into the nearby Gulf of  Finland  and directly affect the Baltic rim countries. Feshbach says one  safety measure, so far not carried out, would be to encase the  dam in cement.    Nuclear waste pockets have also been discovered across the  Baltic hinterlands. Last summer in Lithuania, radioactive  equipment dumped at a landfill in Zokniai, an airfield near  Siulinae, produced alarming geiger readings.    Paldiski, a big submarine base in Estonia, has two nuclear  reactors, a depository for liquid waste, another for solid waste  and underground pipelines for radioactive sewage. In troop  withdrawal talks, Russia has agreed to give up the base, remove  the nuclear fuel rods and take care of waste and the necessary  cleanup. What should be done with the 600 tonnes of liquid  waste and the two reactors is unclear.    Estonia, which has a fiercely nationalistic government,  worries about the proposed length of a Russian cleanup presence  until 2000.    It may look west for help instead, says Alar Olljum, a  foreign ministry spokesman.    But Feshbach worries more about dimethylhydrazine, also  called heptyl, a liquid rocket fuel that is supertoxic,  volatile, carcinogenic and nerve paralysing. Around 270 tonnes  -- of the estimated 150,000 tonnes in the former Soviet Union  have been found around Ventspils, a large Latvian port city.  ""There is no known technology to get rid of it,"" says Feshbach.  ""The cheapest way is to fire it from rockets.""    However, Harry Whitacker, chief of emergency engineering at  Environment Canada, hopes heptyl can be turned into ammonia or  methanol by using ultraviolet light and peroxide in an advanced  oxidation process; and nitric acid, once pumped to the surface,  could be converted to fertiliser if mixed with ammonium and [as  published] hydroxide.  On the Baltic Sea shore, military harbours have been left in a  pitiable state. At Liepaja, a top Soviet Baltic Fleet base, the  harbour floor polluted by heavy metals and crude oil a metre  deep, needs to be dredged.    Just off the coast sit sunken battleship hulls, stripped of  non-ferrous iron. Nearby are submarines which used batteries  leaving semi-toxic residue potentially dangerous if built up  over time. Cleanup would be expensive, but a World Bank  official says the spectacular site of pilfered Soviet warships  might be a profitable tourist site.    The bank has made the conversion of Liepaja from a military  into a commercial centre a priority project in the belief that  the city's large port could be a key trans-shipment point to and  from the Russian market. The bank has obtained the Latvian  government's commitment to support a project of water treatment,  coastal management and tourism. Environment Canada would handle  the military pollution.    Like any economically depressed nation, however, Latvia must  make hard choices on pollution cleanup. A clear economic  incentive is needed to secure funding.    Symbolic cost estimates have been presented to Russia, the  inheritor of the Soviet army. Latvia has sent Moscow a $147m  (99m pounds) bill for land use and anticipated cleanup.  Realistically, however, the Balts do not expect Russia to pay.     "

China's human rights abuses do affect trade. The denial of freedom of association and the right to bargain collectively distorts the labour market. The use of children and millions of prisoners in export industries constitutes unfair competition which can hardly be portrayed as a 'comparative advantage'. Apologists for China, particularly those European and US investors who have largely abandoned production in their own countries and are now fearful of import restrictions, argue that the best way to advance social change is through permitting foreign investors in the country to make even bigger profits. Some hope] US pressure over most-favoured-nation status proves the contrary. For the first time ever, the Chinese have indicated their willingness to discuss human rights. More, not less, pressure is needed. Was it not such pressure that restored democracy in central and eastern Europe? The continuing arrests of worker activists for 'counter-revolutionary activities' and the forcible internment of some in psychiatric institutions is an affront to humanity. China's application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be denied until it accepts international standards on human and worker rights. Trade with China should be strictly limited until it eliminates its inhuman abuse of its workforce. Why must we kow-tow to multinationals making expensive toys and training shoes, in abysmal conditions often using workers as young as the children for which these products are intended in the west? World trade relations should focus on the social dimension. If they move in that direction, then China's economic policies will almost certainly become more market-oriented.

The new space will make it possible to present two blockbusters: the return of the Mark Morris Dance Group in L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, to Handel's music, and the British debut of theatre director Luc Bondy. His production of Peter Handke's The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other imports skateboarders, rollerskaters, Tarzan and Moses from Berlin. Mr Brian McMaster, director of the 1994 festival, said yesterday that the new theatre will ensure that 'there are better facilities in Edinburgh than at any other festival in the world.' This year's festival is budgeted at Pounds 4.8m, Pounds 600,000 up on last year. While the festival dance programme is 'one of the biggest ever' there is evidence of more balance between rival art forms than in recent years. Theatre also includes a new Robert Lepage project at Meadowbank Sports Centre (last year's unexpectedly successful last-minute dance venue). The Seven Streams of the River Ota launches an enterprise scheduled to take two to three years, dealing with the impact on the world of the bombing of Hiroshima. Murrayfield Ice Rink is pressed into service for Aeschylus' Oresteia in a production from Moscow by Peter Stein. Of the opera performances, the most exciting may be The Australian Opera's version of Britten's Midsummer Night's Dream, produced by Baz Luhrmann, the young director of the film Strictly Ballroom, and already rapturously received on its home territory. But the Festival Theatre is baptised appropriately by Scottish Opera on 15 August with Fidelio. Beethoven provides one of the musical themes this year, together with Chabrier, whose Etoile is accompanied by a new production from Opera North of Le Roi Malgre Lui. Beethoven's nine symphonies and five piano concertos will field such performers as Andras Schiff, Richard Goode, Frans Bruggen, Alfred Brendel and Bernard Haitink.

The action marked the first Western military intervention in  the 22-month-old conflict in Bosnia, and NATO's first combat  action since it was founded in 1949.    NATO said two U.S. F-16 fighters first warned and then shot  down four Galeb light attack aircraft early this morning near  Banja Luka, the main Serb air base in northern Bosnia.    U.N. sources in Zagreb told REUTERS the Serb planes had  apparently attacked a Muslim-controlled ammunition factory in  central Bosnia shortly before they were downed.    NATO said the two U.S. F-16s had taken off from an Italian  air base on a patrol mission to enforce the U.N. no-fly zone  over Bosnia, which has been in effect since last April.    The U.N. ban was aimed at preventing the Bosnian warring  factions from using aircraft in the conflict. There have been  some violations, mostly by helicopters flying short trips, but  NATO had not taken action against them.    Hours after the downing of the planes, Bosnian Serb forces  began heavily shelling the center of the Muslim stronghold city  of Tuzla, where the U.N. wants to reopen the airport for aid  flights.    Meanwhile, the U.N. has suspended aid flights to Sarajevo  and  has cancelled convoys through Serb-held areas of Bosnia.    NATO did not carry out threatened air strikes against Serb  forces after the February 21 deadline passed as the Serbs  complied with NATO's demand that their heavy weapons be  withdrawn from around Sarajevo, or be placed under U.N. control.    However, a U.N. official said today that the Serbs had  driven  at least six tanks out of the exclusion zone in violation of the  NATO ultimatum and the U.N.-brokered ceasefire agreement with  the Muslims.

Another  explanation gleaned piecemeal from a source close to the  gendarmerie indicated that the arrest of Paul Henri Yelo  M'Boungana and his comrades could be the consequence of the  incidents that marred this morning's march, especially the  littering of the roadway with household garbage, the stopping of  buses transporting some workers, and the deflation of tyres of  stationary vehicles.    According to latest reports, the Ogooue-Maritime union  leader, Paul Henri Yelo M'boungana and his comrades were picked  from the Gendarmerie by the Army and taken away in a military  vehicle to an unknown destination. COSYGA's activists and  sympathizers went to the governorate to seek an explanation in  the late afternoon but Governor (Antoine Abia Gueyangoe) of  Ogooue-Maritime Province was in a meeting.

AT THE TIME, JOSEPH W. GRIGG  WAS A CORRESPONDENT FOR UNITED PRESS IN BERLIN.      By JOSEPH W. GRIGG, FOR UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL      On Sept. 14, 1940, a hot, brilliantly sunny Sunday, Adolf Hitler's  Nazi-controlled Berlin radio launched an all-out propaganda campaign to  announce to the world the climax of what later became known as the Battle of  Britain and the start of the German Luftwaffe's bombing blitz against London.    Along with other foreign correspondents in Berlin, I was summoned to a special  Sunday afternoon news conference at the Nazi Propaganda Ministry.    Raucous trumpet fanfare, special Nazi government communiques and purported  eyewitness stories by breathless Nazi radio reporters -- this was long before  the days of television -- and a new battle tune titled ""Bombs on England"" kept  the German radio running at white heat throughout that late summer Sunday and  the next week.    With the defeat and surrender of France in June, 1940, Britain had been left  alone to face the might of Hitler's victorious Wermacht and a Luftwaffe that  was at that time the world's most formidable air force.    Over the English Channel and the green fields of southeast England, young,  largely inexperienced and heavily outnumbered British Royal Air Force fighter  pilots plunged in their Spitfires and Hurricanes into battle with the  Luftwaffe's crack Messerschmidt 109 and 110 squadrons.    Nazi bombers blasted Britain's fighter airfields at Manston, Biggin Hill and  elsewhere in southeast England in a bid to smash the Royal Air Force's fighter  resistance.    Hitler's strategy, as expanded at the time to American and other neutral  reporters in Berlin by Nazi officials, depended first on defeating the small,  greatly outnumbered RAF.    His goal was nothing less than the invasion and defeat of Britain and its  elimination from the war. By September, 1940, Hitler already had given orders  to his commanders to prepare for what was to be know as ""Operation Sealion,""  the code name for a planned invasion of England.    But Britain's powerful Royal Navy still controlled the English Channel. Nazi  officials with whom I talked argued that if the RAF were first driven from the  skies, a German invasion armada could cross the Channel under what was  described as an ""umbrella"" of Nazi bombers and fighter planes, against which,  it was claimed, Britain's Royal Navy would be powerless to block the planned  invasion.    Before this, Hitler's master plan called for a general softening up of British  government and civilian morale by means of devastating air raids on London and  other big British cities by the concentrated might of the Luftwaffe.    So convinced were the Nazis that this strategy would succeed that officials in  Berlin boasted that within weeks they would be holding news conferences in  Buckingham Palace, home of Britain's royal family.    Three German reporters of my acquaintance bet me 25 bottles of Champagne that  by July 1, 1941, London and the rest of the British Isles would be under Nazi  occupation. I never collected on that bet because, by the target date in 1941,  Champagne was practically unobtainable in Germany.    For the coming Battle of Britain, Hitler named one of his top aides,  Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering, to be Luftwaffe supreme commander.    Goering concentrated all his available air strength of 3,000 planes in occupied  northern France. He set up his own headquarters on the French channel coast  from which in clear weather he could stare across the 20 miles to the white  chalk cliffs of Dover.    In the last days of August and early September, Goering unleashed his bomber  fleets to attack British coastal shipping and ports and to pound key RAF  fighter bases in southeastern England. His aim was to drive the RAF back into  the interior of the country.    But the British managed to make their fighter bases usable again much faster  than the Nazis had expected.    In the ensuing air battles the RAF's Spitfires and Hurricanes suffered grievous  losses. Between Aug. 24 and Sept. 6, according to British figures, Britain lost  nearly one-fourth of its 1,000 fighter pilots.    But the RAF still survived as an effective fighting force.    As Winston Churchill declared later in a historic speech to the British House  of Commons, ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many  to so few.""    Sept. 14 and 15 are commemorated in Britain. On those two days the Luftwaffe  launched its greatest concentrated onslaught yet in daylight attacks against  London. But postwar information has shown that Luftwaffe losses on those days  alone were 56 fighters and bombers. British losses were about half that number.    British leaders had estimated that in order to survive, the RAF needed to down  three Luftwaffe planes to every one RAF plane lost.    Despite grim RAF losses, the result of the Battle of Britain was a defeat for  the Luftwaffe. All told, in three months in 1940 the Luftwaffe lost nearly  2,000 planes. Hitler had to abandon forever his plan to invade England.    British civilian morale remained high despite 20,000 casualties and long nights  spent in bomb shelters and London subway tunnels.    An angry Goering returned from northern France to Berlin after delivering a  tongue-lashing to his Luftwaffe pilots with these words, ""You have not only  deeply disappointed me, you have betrayed me.""    Nearly four years after the defeat of Hitler's plan to invade Britain, U.S.,  British and Canadian forces crossed the English Channel to Nazi-occupied Europe  on D-Day, June 6, 1944, the forerunner of Allied World War II victory in  Europe.

Faced with countless smugglers, called coyotes, whose sophisticated operations  charge thousands of dollars to transport people from Latin America to this  country, the Immigration and Naturalization Service is fighting back with a  crack unit of 300 special agents called, ""Coyote Busters.""    The effort, which often includes agents from the Drug Enforcement  Administration, the FBI and other federal agencies, is producing an unusual  amount of agreement between the INS and its usually harsh critics among  immigrant rights groups.

Cecilia Munoz, of the National Council of La Raza, observed: ""Any effort to  control the border should include the attempt to control individuals who  exploit potential border-crossers.""    Officially members of the anti-smuggling unit of INS, many of the agents work  undercover in jobs such as drivers and guides. They often risk their lives --  at times even operating ""drop houses"" or getting themselves sold to  unscrupulous labor contractors, INS officials said.    ""Some of the stuff these agents do is hair-raising,"" said Bob O'Leary, senior  special agent of the INS unit, which was formed in 1978.    It found its mission increasingly difficult as waves of Central Americans began  pouring into this country in the 1980s. And with passage of the 1986  Immigration Reform and Control Act, illegal immigrants find it more and more  difficult to live and work underground without smugglers and their cohorts to  provide them with fake documents.    ""We're coming into a whole new generation"" of smugglers and immigrants, said  O'Leary. ""We have to send a message that smuggling will not be tolerated. One  of our goals is to protect those who get ripped off, murdered and raped by  unscrupulous smugglers near our borders.""      A Growing Problem    Demonstrating the magnitude of the problem, agents in 1988 apprehended 13,200  smugglers and 28,108 smuggled immigrants, seizing 9,677 vehicles worth $27.7  million. In 1988, 1,121 smugglers were convicted of felonies; 4,868 were  convicted of misdemeanors.    In two operations this week, the INS arrested 148 suspected illegal immigrants  from Mexico and other Latin American countries. One suspected smuggler also was  arrested. Some of the immigrants said they paid as much as $4,000 to smugglers.    While many immigrants pay high prices to enter the United States, the costs to  others are even more dear. Some die in locked boxcars or on desert marches,  while others are held hostage because relatives do not pay up, INS officials  say.    ""I personally have been involved in cases where aliens were robbed at gunpoint  in a garage,"" said Ron Smith, an INS official at the Western Region  headquarters in Laguna Niguel.    The two cities where arrests were made this week -- Atlanta and Los Angeles --  graphically show the nationwide range of smuggling rings. Their tactics vary,  too.    ""There is no limitation to the methods smugglers use,"" Smith said. ""They use  Amtrak, trucks, gas tanks in cars. We've even had reports that they (have) used  small submarines.""    Officials said smugglers increasingly include drugs and semiautomatic weapons  in their activities. ""They are diversifying,"" one official noted.    Federal officials said they face an increasing number of high-speed chases,  which often endanger innocent bystanders. INS officials said it is partly out  of this concern that they are planning to build a controversial 14-foot,  $2-million ditch along the border near San Diego.    The smugglers are not all from Latin America. In fact, said one Justice  Department official, ""The most difficult and sophisticated group"" is based in  China, using Hong Kong as a staging area. ""Their network extends worldwide.""    At the same time, the smugglers are specializing more than before, said INS  officials. In the past, one network would recruit immigrants, select a staging  area, guide and deliver the immigrants across the U.S. border. ""As of late,""  said one official, ""many smugglers have become so specialized that they perform  only one of these functions.""    Training Coyote Busters is specialized as well. Agents compete to be accepted  in the unit, and then are sent to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center  in Glynco, Ga., for three weeks of intensive training. They learn how to  identify smugglers, penetrate organizations and recruit informants.    The 300 agents are based around the nation, with heavy concentrations in  California, Texas, New York and Chicago, favorite destinations for illegal  immigrants.    The unit boasts that while it represents only 4% of the total INS force, it  accounts for 36% of the felony convictions and 37% of the agency's conspiracy  convictions.    Among its recent successes, the unit cites Operation Boxcar, a four-month  effort that netted 3,200 Latin American immigrants and 87 suspected smugglers  in locked railroad cars.    Operation Shorty involved an international organization smuggling Guatemalan  Indians to farm labor contractors throughout the United States, where they  lived in ""utterly squalid conditions,"" INS documents report. After a yearlong  investigation using undercover drivers, labor contractors and agents posing as  immigrants, a federal task force arrested 110 suspected smugglers and 5,000  immigrants, who were returned to Guatemala.

Many federal officials liken their struggle to the  drug war, with more and more people getting into the mix.    Is the federal government winning or losing?

Many Yemenis were fleeing the capital, loading up their possessions and heading for the comparative safety of the countryside. Northern leaders broadcast assurances that they had no intention of bombing the south. Military observers in Sanaa said yesterday that advances towards Aden from the north and east had been repelled by southern forces, but they could give no precise details of troop locations or of any further military movements. British, Chinese, French, Indian, Syrian and US citizens were among those flocking to Sanaa airport, while other groups were reported to be travelling by road to the Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Mocha for evacuation by sea. British embassy officials, who are co-ordinating flights for their citizens, expected nearly 160 people of various nationalities to board two RAF Hercules. Earlier plans to send evacuees to Djibouti had to be cancelled because of growing congestion there, the officials said. Many shops in Sanaa were closed and queues of up to 200 vehicles waited at filling stations for the increasingly scarce supplies of petrol. Yemenis normally use some 65,000 barrels a day, mostly produced at the refinery in Aden. Fears among the northern population rose sharply following the explosion on Wednesday of a Scud missile launched by southern forces east of Sanaa. Some 23 people have been reported killed in the blast and many others injured. The target of the attack was apparently a nearby palace belonging to the northern leader, Gen Ali Abdullah Saleh. Officials in Sanaa claim that the south has now launched some 20 Scuds against targets in the north. Meeting defence officials, President Saleh accused his southern rivals of targeting civilians and vowed retaliation. He repeated his earlier calls for the southern leader, Mr Ali Salem al-Biedh, to surrender, saying that Mr al-Biedh and other southern leaders would receive fair trials.

THE  APPLICATION PROCESS WILL BECOME MORE STRINGENT JUNE 1.      By MARK GLADSTONE and H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      SACRAMENTO      The California Highway Patrol, prompted in part by two San Diego incidents,  announced Thursday that state officials will toughen the application process  for school bus drivers.    Robert Rengstorff, chief of enforcement for the California Highway Patrol, told  the Assembly Transportation Committee that, as of June 1, the 180-day temporary  licenses -- given to drivers employed by school districts and private  contractors -- will no longer be issued.    Two San Diego incidents involving drivers employed by Laidlaw Transit played a  major role in the decision to make the application process more stringent.    Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who called the hearing, mentioned a Feb. 2  accident in which a Laidlaw driver was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving  after the bus he was operating rear-ended a pickup truck on Balboa Avenue near  Mission Bay Drive. The other incident occurred in 1987, when driver Victor H.  Gomez was charged with kidnaping a 5-year-old girl and molesting her in the  bus.    Under the CHP plan, applicants for a permit to drive school buses will receive  their licenses only after fingerprint and background checks are completed. Now,  drivers who pass state tests are given temporary six-month permits before  checks are made.    Rengstorff said authorities are targeting school bus drivers because ""there  just seems to have been numerous instances where contractor-employed applicants  have been involved in serious bus incidents,"" Rengstorff said.    Katz called the hearing to examine the procedures of Laidlaw, other bus  companies, school districts and state agencies. ""There's something seriously  out of whack"" in the system, Katz said.    He cited the arrests of two Laidlaw employees accused of driving buses while  drunk -- one in the San Fernando Valley and the other in San Diego. Laidlaw  receives about $20 million a year from the Los Angeles Unified School District  as its largest bus contractor.    In January, Laidlaw driver Harold Keith Lone was arrested in Encino as he  prepared to pick up students at Lanai Elementary. A breath test showed Lone had  a blood-alcohol level of 0.27%, more than three times the new legal limit of  0.08%. Authorities have said that Lone obtained his job by using an alias to  hide a lengthy record, including five drunk-driving convictions.    In the San Diego accident, the driver was transporting Clairemont High School  students when he collided with the pickup truck, injuring three people,  according to the CHP.    Moreover, Katz voiced concern about the other San Diego case involving Gomez.  According to prosecutors, Gomez kidnaped and molested the girl on April 21,  1987. He was ordered to stand trial but failed to appear on Jan. 20, 1988, and  San Diego police say he remains a fugitive. A civil lawsuit filed on behalf of  the child against Laidlaw is pending.    At Thursday's hearing, Katz expressed shock that Gomez is still listed as  having a valid license to drive a school bus. Bill Gengler, a spokesman for the  Department of Motor Vehicles, confirmed that his agency ""had not suspended or  revoked"" Gomez's license because ""we had no information from law enforcement or  other sources that would allow us to act.""    But Katz complained about DMV's ""business-as-usual approach"" in cases like  Gomez's. He also said that Laidlaw and other private bus contractors ""are not  acknowledging their responsibility to develop a better procedure of screening  the drivers.""    Dave Daley, vice president of operations for Van Nuys-based Laidlaw Transit,  acknowledged that, when he joined the local operation, ""substantial  improvements were needed.""    For example, since Katz's committee held a similar hearing in 1988, Daley said  that Laidlaw has beefed up checks on applicant references and its training. ""We  feel our procedures have been corrected in a responsive manner,"" he said.    Daley described the latest arrests of drivers as ""isolated,"" but said they  pointed up the need to improve staff training to detect drug and alcohol abuse  among drivers.    To prevent future problems, Laidlaw officials asked the committee to adopt  criminal sanctions against drivers who lie about their background on employment  applications, including a mandatory six-month jail term and $10,000 fine for  violations.    In San Diego, Laidlaw attorney Eric Freedus denied allegations, in the civil  suit against Laidlaw, that the company failed to do a background check of  Gomez. Freedus said the company ""requested a certificate"" from a law  enforcement agency, which checked Gomez's background and found nothing that  would prevent him from working as a bus driver.    Freedus could not recall which law enforcement agency was supposed to have  checked Gomez's background.    ""The report came back negative, clean. . . . An employer has a limited ability  to do a background check on an individual. If (law enforcement agencies) cannot  come up with anything in a man's background, how can an employer?"" Freedus  said.    He also questioned allegations that the girl was molested by Gomez and said  there is evidence that the ""mother suggested things"" to the child.    ""Laidlaw's position is that, if this incident occurred, it is very unfortunate  . . . But there is clearly evidence that words were put into the child's  mouth,"" Freedus said.    In a letter to the Assembly committee, attorney Irwin M. Zalkin, who is  representing the child in the civil suit, alleged that the National City and  Coronado school districts had requested that Laidlaw remove Gomez from routes  in their districts. Zalkin alleged that students from the two districts  complained that Gomez was rude, made racial comments and ""was sexually  suggestive to the girls on the bus.""    Carla Bruno, spokeswoman for the local Laidlaw office, said she did not know if  the allegations made by Zalkin are true.    Mark Gladstone reported from Sacramento and H.G. Reza from San Diego.

PAC national organiser Maxwell  Nemadzivhanani was reacting to reports that Mr Kriel had linked  Transkei to the St James Church and Heidelberg Tavern massacres.    Mr Nemadzvhanani said in a statement the recent arrests of  PAC western Cape leaders Theo Mabusela and Michael Siyolo, as  well as attempts to link Transkei to Azanian Peoples Liberation  Army [APLA] attacks on South Africa, were ""part of the regime's  strategy to target the PAC in those areas where it is strong"".  He accused ""the same forces"" for arresting PAC leaders and  members in a ""nation-wide swoop"" in May 1993 and ""killing  children"" in a raid on a house in Transkei in October last year.    ""Following the Kenilworth church gun attack in July 1993 in  Cape Town, the regime summarily arrested Vuyo Tekane, a PAC  activist and schoolteacher allegedly for masterminding alleged  APLA activities. ""Tekane, according to police allegations then,  was also linked to the 1922 APLA attack at a King William's Town  golf club. Once again Tekane was released from detention without  being charged for the alleged offences,"" Mr Nemadzivhanani said.    He said from all the cases or ""so-called police  breakthroughs"" a clear picture had emerged of ""camouflaged  hostilities"" against the PAC in the guise of maintaining law and  order. ""The PAC strongly condemns the detention of Comrades Theo  Mabusela and Michael Siyolo as pure political gangsterism by the  (President F W) de Klerk regime, designed to manipulate the  transition and eventually the outcome of the election by  'unlevelling' the playing field against the PAC and thus rigging  the elections long before they start,"" Mr Nemadzvhanani said.    Mr Nemadzvhanani's statement was issued to SAPA shortly  before Mr Kriel on Wednesday announced the arrest of two alleged  APLA members in connection with the Heidelberg Tavern attack.     "

The ruling coalition endorsed the government's traditional  view on the issue in an official statement to be submitted to  the Hague- based International Court, they said.    The gist of the government's statement on the use of nuclear  arms was approved by a meeting of coalition executives when it  was presented to the meeting by the Foreign Ministry.    The statement is in response to the court's request that  each  country submit such a document by Friday. The court was asked  in May by the World Health Organization (WHO) to decide whether  or not staging a nuclear warfare violates international law.    WHO, inspired by growing concerns about the adverse effect  any use of nuclear arms would have on people's health, sought  the court's ruling on the issue.    In the statement, the government will also elucidate Japan's  basic stance on nuclear arms as symbolized by the so-called  three nonnuclear principles.    Japan has been holding strict antinuclear principles -- not  making, possessing or introducing nuclear weapons to Japan -- as  a national tenet since they were approved by the Diet in 1968.    Nagasaki, which suffered atomic bombing in 1945 after  Hiroshima, has raised objection to the government's standing on  the issue.    It presented a written request to Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata  and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, calling on the government to  denounce the use of nuclear arms as violation of international  law.    Nagasaki argues in the document that the indiscriminate  killing of people with atomic bombs clearly constitutes a  violation of international law from a humanistic standpoint.    The city criticized the government for not fully  acknowledging the devastating conditions in the A-bombed areas  or the agony of the victims.     "

Reports speak of destruction but no casualties, he  said.    Armenian defences were unable to thwart the attack because  the two planes flew at a low altitude making it difficult to  detect them.    Two days ago, Azerbaijan carried out a bombing raid on  several areas in Nagorno-Karabakh and its administrative center  Stepanakert; one woman and two children were killed and nine  other people injured, most of them women and children. However,  Baku denies this.    The Armenian villages of Movses and Aigepar in the Taush  region and Armenian positions outside Aigeovit and Vazashen  villages came under intensive artillery fire from Azeri troops  in the past twenty-four hours, the press office of the Armenian  Defence Ministry said. There were civilian casualties, it  informed.    It also said Armenian forces foiled an Azeri advance outside  the Aigeovit village in the Idjevan Region on Monday. There  were casualties on both sides.    For its part, the Azeri Defence Ministry reports that  Karabakh forces which received reinforcements from Armenia had  tried to launch an offensive in the northern part of the  frontline outside the village of Gyulistan in the Geranboi  (formerly Shaumian) region. Baku says that about 2,000 Karabakh  troops and dozens of tanks were involved. Azeri government  troops have so far succeeded in containing the Armenian advance,  it said.    In a separate development, Armenian forces launched an  offensive on the eastern Azeri villages of Talysh, Madagiz and  Levonarkh in the Ter-Ter Region. Several people were killed or  injured after Armenian troops mounted rocket fire on the  administrative center Ter-Ter whose population is 20,000.    More fighting is reported elsewhere on the front including  the Agdam Region. Several population centers in the Tauz Region  came under cross border rocket and artillery fire from Armenia  leading to civilian casualties, the Azeri Defence Ministry said.     "

The move cuts tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs and followed a warning by extremist Islamic groups, responsible for slaying eight Israelis in two separate attacks, that they would step up their violent activities and 'continue in the path of blood and martyrdom'. President Bill Clinton condemned the Palestinian attacks as 'acts of terrorism' aimed at stopping the Middle East peace process. The Palestine Liberation Organisation, in its first official comment said it regretted Wednesday's car bombing which left seven Israelis dead and urged Israel to implement the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord as soon as possible. Despite intense domestic pressure the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said it would continue peace talks with the PLO in Cairo on Sunday after observing the annual Holocaust memorial day and the Jewish sabbath. Israel's closure of the occupied territories was intended to calm public fears of more bloody attacks by Islamic groups seeking revenge for the February massacre of 29 Arabs by a Jewish settler in Hebron. In the southern Israeli town of Ashdod, a Palestinian guerrilla of the Islamic Jihad group, who lived in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, yesterday sprayed a bus stop at a busy intersection with gunfire, killing an Israeli and wounding four. Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza yesterday to stock up on food and supplies and prepare for 'an atmosphere of real war which will engulf the Zionist soldiers and enemy commanders in the coming days.' Hamas, which bitterly opposes the Israeli-PLO peace agreement and wants to build an Islamic state in all the historical land of Palestine, said at least four more attacks were being prepared. In Israel, right-wing opposition leaders have called for a suspension of the peace talks and the resignation of Mr Rabin.   Countries:-  ILZ  Israel, Middle East.

Here is our colleague with a report on this.    [Unidentified correspondent, by telephone] It is reported  that fighter planes belonging to General Dostam and Ahmad Shah  Mas'ud appeared in the Kabul sky today and bombarded each  other's positions.    During the past two days air attacks by warring forces have  been very severe. While General Dostam's fighter planes have  bombed the presidential palace and the Baghram military airport  on several occasions, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's fighter planes have  attacked several of his opponents' positions, including  Charasyab, situated 25 km south of Kabul. According to reports  the presidential palace has been severely damaged. Furthermore,  yesterday's bombing of Charasyab caused great damage to the  Afghan prime minister's television center. The Afghan Hezb-e  Eslami [Islamic Party] has, however, once again declared its  neutrality concerning the current fighting in Kabul.    The secretary general of the Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic  Unity Party] said yesterday: The current war -- just like the  other conflicts in the past 21 months -- will not have a  decisive effect in resolving the Afghan political problems. He  added: The only way to resolve Afghan problems is to set up a  neutral government in which the principal participants would be  the four main political and military groups; that is, the Hezb-e  Eslami, Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], Hezb-e Wahdat-e  Eslami, and the Afghan National Islamic Movement. Abdolali  Mazari said: Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami cooperates with the other  members of the Afghan Supreme Cooperation Council solely from a  political point of view.    Meanwhile reports coming from Jalalabad indicate that  thousands of refugees from Kabul are stranded without any  shelter in cold mountain areas between Jalalabad and the  Pakistani border. Kabul hospital sources say that the fighting  in the past three weeks has left hundreds dead and more than  8,000 injured.     "

The newspapers quoted spokesmen of the Alex Boncayo Brigade  (ABB), the urban assassination squad of the insurgent New  People's Army (NPA), that they would target representatives of  these three groups unless President Fidel Ramos reversed a 22  percent increase in the prices of fuel products.    The formerly-dormant ABB, which killed over 200 soldiers,  policemen and civilians in Manila from 1987-90, earlier claimed  responsibility for the bombing of the offices of three oil  companies in this city on Tuesday. The ABB said the bombings  were intended to protest the oil price hike imposed last Friday.  The ABB added that if the government agreed to reverse the oil  price hike, they in return would agree to open peace talks with  the government.    The Communist Party of the Philippines, the political  leadership of the NPA, is already considering peace negotiations  with the Ramos government, but talks have been stalled by  numerous conditions imposed by the insurgents.    Meanwhile, an anti-Ramos newspaper, in an editorial  published  Thursday, called on the assassins to target local officials and  not foreigners. The Today, a broadsheet which began publishing  just last month, in reaction to the ABB's threat said: ""Do we  have to remind the ABB that native insurgencies are supposed to  kill native officials, not foreign civilians or diplomatic  personnel?"" The newspaper said that attacking foreigners would  only scare away foreign investment and would only give the Ramos  government justification to crack down on civil liberties, ""so  it can steal in peace and stay in power.""    The newspaper also said that the ABB ""doesn't have the  discrimination and the balls to tackle its proper enemy -- the  government and its officials."" ""What a pity. Yet another golden  opportunity to prove the ABB's usefulness thrown out the  window,"" the editorial concluded.     "

CONVICTIONS ARE RISING.      By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A 28-year-old Oceanside man got two surprises when a California Highway Patrol  officer pulled him over on a speeding charge one Friday night in Orange County.    Although he felt unimpaired, he had downed enough beer after work that a  Breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol level to register .08%, the new  legal limit.    Not only was he arrested, but he was stripped of his driver's license, a second  result of the state's new and tougher drunk driving laws.    This year has seen some of the most significant changes in California drunk  driving laws in a decade. Only three other states -- Utah, Maine and Oregon --  have legal blood alcohol limits as low as California.    As a result, more drivers have been arrested on state highways than ever  before, and drunk driving convictions are approaching an all-time high. The  statistics are particularly striking in the seven-county Southern California  region.    In the wake of the new .08% legal limit, 16% more drivers have been arrested  for drunk driving on the state's highways and 10% more drivers were convicted  of the crime during the first ten months of this year than during the same  period in 1989.    To their delight, law enforcement officers say the new law -- which lowers the  legal limit from .10% to .08% -- is allowing them to snare a new kind of drunk  driver. The ones, in the Oceanside man's words, who ""are just a little bit  drunk."" They are drivers who were borderline under the old legal limit but  clearly can be prosecuted now, officials say.    (For an average 150 pound man, the new law means drinking two beers instead of  three an hour before getting behind the wheel. Although the average level of  intoxication in California is .17%, almost 10%, or 11,000, drivers arrested  statewide so far this year by the California Highway Patrol had a level of .10%  or less.)    The new law also allows police to confiscate a drunk driver's license on the  spot -- a provision that tends to leave an indelible mark on the memories of  drunk drivers, officials say.    But the tougher laws have also had some unintended consequences: Many more  drivers are choosing to fight the charges in court, believing they are  unimpaired at the .08% limit -- a claim that medical authorities dispute.    ""It's understandable that a driver feels that way, but from a scientist's point  of view, a driver is impaired at .08%,"" said Dr. Lonnie Bristow, a physician  and trustee with the American Medical Assn., which prefers a .05% legal limit.    The controversy over the lower limit also has been responsible for a rise of as  much as 20% in jury trials in some areas, such as Orange County.    At the lower blood alcohol levels drivers don't ""feel they were under the  influence. Their memory of the event is pretty good and they feel they didn't  do it,"" said Judge John Ouderkirk of the Los Angeles Traffic Court. ""At the  higher range, they don't remember anything, and in their heart, they know they  were under the influence.""    Officials in San Diego, who also report an increase in drunk driving trials,  say that although they are prosecuting 15% more cases this year, the low-level  cases are more difficult to pursue.    In these cases, drivers can more readily perform the field sobriety tests --  such as walking a straight line -- and officers depend more heavily on chemical  tests to show intoxication. During trials, the chemical tests draw fire as  lawyers attempt to downplay their reliability. Experts say the tests can  deviate by .01.    ""Skillful defense attorneys can -- through clever arguments -- persuade an  earnest jury that there is a .02 deviation in the breath test. Some juries buy  that,"" said Gretchen North, head deputy city attorney in San Diego. ""But  obviously we wouldn't be picking up the .08s if we weren't winning them.""    And DMV records show that the increase in arrests has led to more drunk driving  convictions in the Southland. ""The laws are doing what was intended -- closing  the loopholes and increasing arrests and convictions,"" said Paul Snodgrass, the  driving-under-the-influence coordinator with the National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration's San Francisco regional office.    ""Increased conviction is increased deterrent as far as we are concerned -- the  .08 law means less people will drive drunk,"" said Carolee Newman, spokeswoman  for the Los Angeles chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. ""The law is  outstanding.""    Officer Gil Payne, a 20-year veteran assigned to the California Highway Patrol  in San Juan Capistrano, says he sees a difference on the roads. Payne describes  himself as a ""Deuce Buster,"" or an officer who specializes in nabbing drunk  drivers. For the last 16 years, Payne has worked a nine-hour shift that starts  at 7:30 p.m. -- considered prime time for drinking drivers.    ""We have come a long way from 10 years ago,"" Payne said. ""People are finding  out that the risk just isn't worth it. The penalties are getting tougher and  tougher.""    On a recent Friday night, Payne and his partner, Leon LaSage, patrolled the San  Juan Capistrano highways and roadways, driving 162 miles. By the end of their  shift, they had doled out several speeding tickets and made two drunk driving  arrests.    One man, a 20-year-old from Laguna Niguel, had zoomed around a street corner,  tires squealing. After being pulled over, he scored a low but still illegal  blood alcohol level on the hand-held breath analysis device. Although readings  from this device cannot be used as evidence in court, CHP officers frequently  use it to double-check their own estimates of a driver's impairment.    Handcuffed and placed in the patrol car, the man objected: ""There are many more  people who are more intoxicated than I am.""    Usually, the introduction of a new law heightens awareness of a problem, which,  in turn, tends to boost arrests and convictions, said Cliff Helander, research  manager of the DMV's alcohol research unit.    But some courts are limited in what they can do, many experts say. Across  California, a DUI case takes an average of six months to adjudicate. Many  experts say that by the time an intoxicated driver is punished by the legal  system, he has long since forgotten his crime.    In hopes of addressing the problem, the new prompt license suspension law went  into effect in July. Traffic experts believe this sanction will probably do  more to keep drunk drivers off the road than the .08% limit.    Under the license suspension law, officers can seize the licenses of those  arrested on suspicion of drunk driving if their blood alcohol level is .08% or  higher. They can also yank the license if the driver refuses to undergo a  chemical test. In place of the license, officers provide a 45-day temporary  license. Drivers have 10 days to appeal the license suspension to the  Department of Motor Vehicles.    Many, however, are unaware of the suspension law, so they are stunned when an  officer plucks their license. Since July, 105,000 drivers statewide have had  their licenses pulled when they were arrested for driving while intoxicated.    One 29-year-old San Clemente woman said the sting of a license suspension was  effective. ""I made a stupid mistake, and it's the price I've got to pay,"" said  the paralegal typist. ""It's just a hassle. The whole thing made me feel like a  criminal.""    With prompt license suspension, the punishment immediately follows the crime --  which makes it one of the most powerful tools to help keep intoxicated drivers  off the roads, said Snodgrass of the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration.    When you take a license away, some drive anyway, but most don't, he said.  Similar license suspension laws are on the books in 28 states and the District  of Columbia. One study in those states showed that prompt license suspension  reduced fatal crashes by about 9%.    So far, fatal traffic accidents of all kind, not just alcohol-related ones --  have declined by about 7% on California's roads. But officials are uncertain  whether to credit the new drunk driving laws for this accomplishment or the  fact that more people are wearing seat belts, said Sam Haynes, a CHP spokesman.    While some lawyers have questioned whether this sanction violates a driver's  right to due process, a Supreme Court case, however, upheld the law in 1979.  Others -- drivers and lawyers -- say the law is crippling and poses hardship in  Southern California, which has little public transportation.    But many others say the double punch of yanking a license and the lower  drinking limit is effective.    ""If I could turn back time, I would turn back Friday night,"" said the San  Clemente typist. ""I didn't need to get behind the wheel and drive. That arrest  made me sober up fast.""

CONVICTIONS ARE RISING.      By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER      A 28-year-old Oceanside man got two surprises when a California Highway Patrol  officer pulled him over on a speeding charge one Friday night in Orange County.    Although he felt unimpaired, he had downed enough beer after work that a  Breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol level to register .08%, the new  legal limit.    Not only was he arrested, but he was stripped of his driver's license, a second  result of the state's new and tougher drunk driving laws.    This year has seen some of the most significant changes in California drunk  driving laws in a decade. Only three other states -- Utah, Maine and Oregon --  have legal blood alcohol limits as low as California.    As a result, more drivers have been arrested on state highways than ever  before, and drunk driving convictions are approaching an all-time high. The  statistics are particularly striking in the seven-county Southern California  region.    In the wake of the new .08% legal limit, 16% more drivers have been arrested  for drunk driving on the state's highways and 10% more drivers were convicted  of the crime during the first ten months of this year than during the same  period in 1989.    To their delight, law enforcement officers say the new law -- which lowers the  legal limit from .10% to .08% -- is allowing them to snare a new kind of drunk  driver. The ones, in the Oceanside man's words, who ""are just a little bit  drunk."" They are drivers who were borderline under the old legal limit but  clearly can be prosecuted now, officials say.    (For an average 150 pound man, the new law means drinking two beers instead of  three an hour before getting behind the wheel. Although the average level of  intoxication in California is .17%, almost 10%, or 11,000, drivers arrested  statewide so far this year by the California Highway Patrol had a level of .10%  or less.)    The new law also allows police to confiscate a drunk driver's license on the  spot -- a provision that tends to leave an indelible mark on the memories of  drunk drivers, officials say.

The two organizations are  cooperating closely. We interviewed two high-ranking officials  of the National Security Office, who do not wish their names to  be revealed. They asked for our understanding because, in the  course of investigating such affairs, there are always moments  that cannot be made public. We first asked them to deal with  the speculation here and abroad.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Is it possible that an international  terrorist organization is behind this bombing at the parliament?    [Official] Like other versions, this is not impossible.  However, these organizations generally declare themselves after  the event or immediately beforehand. In other words, they  ""claim responsibility."" No such signal has arrived in this case.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Do you consider it possible that a domestic  extremist organization is behind it?    [Official] One cannot exclude this possibility, but there is  no tradition of such a thing in Hungary. The fact that  Parliament is also the symbol of our national past and history  speaks against this possibility. Most known extremist  organizations we can think of in this respect stress their  national roots, and this does not seem to be compatible with an  action against this historical site of our statehood.    [NEPSZABADSAG] There are autonomous forces operating beyond  our southern borders, forces that are not under state control.  Threats against Hungarians in Vojvodina have also been mentioned  in the press. There are rumors about the possibility of such  organizations extending their operations beyond their own  borders. Could all this be connected with the explosion?    [Official] I do not know your sources of information.  Consequently, I do not want to comment at all on what you have  just said. I repeat: We will investigate every possibility.  We will not leave out any possibility.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Including the possibility that this action  could somehow be connected with Magda Marinko's affair?    [Official] I am sorry that I have to repeat: We will not  leave out any possibility. Not even such a possibility. Nor  the possibility that a ""lone wolf"" or a crazy man carried out  the bombing.    [NEPSZABADSAG] You saw the location. What would you add to  the descriptions that appeared in the press?    [Official] The fact that the front of Gate No. 19 was  protected by a fence; at the same time, this is a building area.  The attacker had to get over the fence, but this was probably  not difficult because there were holes in the fence. A man of  average physical condition could reach the gate from the Danube,  place the bomb, and disappear in 3-4 minutes. If we take into  account the approximately 6 minutes between two appearances of  the guard in this area, the bomber had enough time.    [NEPSZABADSAG] In other words, a single person could have  done it.    [Unnamed official] It is not impossible. It is another  matter that, in such cases, there is preliminary surveillance of  the guards' movements and the placement of the television  cameras, and there could be accomplices to choose the location  and provide accommodation. However, with exact knowledge of the  specifics of the location, a single person and 3-4 minutes would  be enough.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Is the bomb found at Parliament a ""relative""  of the one in Szeged?    [Official] Yes, but I would entrust my colleagues with the  details.    [NEPSZABADSAG] You have been on location since early  morning. What did you do?    [Official] We cooperated closely with the police bomb  disposal experts. We collected everything that remained from  the explosive device. Everything goes to the lab. It is  tedious work, but it is worth it. The location and what remains  there tell a lot even about the most sophisticated bomb.    [NEPSZABADSAG] What did you find?    [Official] We found many pieces of a green-colored plastic,  presumably pieces of a soap-holder-type box which held the  alarm-watch-type timing device. There must have been somewhat  less than one kilogram of TNT in the bomb.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Is this a lot or little? What if this amount  explodes on or in a car for example?    [Official] It is a strong bomb that would kill all the  passengers and destroy the car completely.    [NEPSZABADSAG] How big could this bomb be?    [Official] Altogether not bigger than 20x15 cm. It could  comfortably be placed in a shopping bag.    [NEPSZABADSAG] In what range can the timing device be set?  Could you reconstruct the bomb?    [Official] The explosion can be set from 15 minutes to 26  hours. Theoretically, it can also be set for a shorter time  than 15 minutes, but if the time span is too short, it could  also endanger the terrorist himself. Of course, we cannot say  when the device was set before the explosion. Not only can we  reconstruct the bomb but, thanks to what the bomb disposal  experts have collected, we can see the exact model. Everything  on this model is identical with this bomb before it went off.    [NEPSZABADSAG] In connection with the bomb in Szeged, your  colleague said only that it was a ""relative"" of the bomb that  exploded at the Parliament.    [Official] If I may use the term here, I would say it was  its little brother. We tested its power by analyzing the  deformations on the pillar. The result: We are talking here  about the same device, the same mechanical timing device, the  same bomb, only with half the amount of explosive material.    [NEPSZABADSAG] In other words, it could be the same  perpetrator. Is it possible that he is preparing for a third  attack?    [Official] We cannot answer this question. Together with  our police colleagues, we are working to discover and arrest the  perpetrator or perpetrators....     "

'We are consulting with a lot of parties. We hope to find a way out to bring things back to normal,' Mr Mubarak told reporters, without elaborating. The talks took place inside a military airbase at Sidi Barani, 75 km east of the border town of Salloum. It was the Libyan leader's first high-level encounter with a fellow Arab ruler since United Nations sanctions, including an air and arms embargo, came into force last Wednesday. It was not immediately clear whether the meeting would yield any fresh ideas to resolve the crisis. In remarks to reporters, Mr Mubarak warned against a military solution, saying that such an approach would merely 'increase dangers and complicate matters'. 'I don't think there will be extra measures (against Libya) soon, but I hope that we could reach a solution before any extra measures,' he declared. Egypt's president has had a series of meetings with Col Gadaffi aimed at resolving the dispute over Libya's continued refusal to yield nationals suspected of involvement in the 1988 and 1989 bombings of American and French airliners. With more than 1m Egyptians working in Libya, Egypt fears that if the crisis continues to fester, open conflict might ensue, destabilising Libya in the process. Cairo has urged Libya to hand over the two men accused of bombing Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland for trial in either Britain or the US, but Tripoli after indicating that it might be prepared to do so has repeatedly balked at the last moment. Libya has also been resisting French attempts to gain access to four Libyans, including Col Gadaffi's brother-in-law, for questioning in connection with the blowing up of a French UTA flight over Niger.

0,FT941-4928 ,"FT941-4928 _AN-ECICYACUFT 940309   FT  09 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: East counts cost of a dirty legacy - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania face a big bill after 50 years of Soviet army sloppiness      By MATTHEW KAMINSKI   The Soviet army may be withdrawing from eastern Europe but it has left behind an ecological mess. The bill for the clean-up operation will be staggering. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are currently sizing up the fallout from 50 years of sloppiness at more than 1,000 former Soviet military facilities. This legacy of Soviet rule, ranging from nuclear waste to water pollution, should keep policy planners and eco-businesses busy for years. Soviet pilots, for instance, would regularly dump jet fuel on the ground to minimise flying hours. At the Tapa military air base in Estonia, 16 sq km are polluted by jet fuel, 7m deep in some places. At most Soviet airfields in the Baltic region - as in east Germany and the Czech Republic - waste fuel, while not toxic, has seeped into the region's shallow natural groundwater reserves and raised purification costs. The World Bank has examined the damage at Latvia's Tukums air force base, and is considering funding clean-up programmes. Environment Canada, a government agency, has offered to train Latvians in site remediation and assessment. But institutional lenders have yet to commit substantial funds to clean-up efforts. Meanwhile Baltec, a private Latvian company, has begun a bioremediation project at Tukums. Over five years, it plans to pump out the jet fuel, some of which can be salvaged and resold, and put bacteria into the soil to break down the remaining fuel. Inspectors previously barred from secret sites are finding other and more worrying surprises. Near Zvarde, an eastern Latvian town, more than 24,000 ha of farmland were confiscated for air target practice. The land was returned to Latvia after independence, leaving a trail of pollution, deforestation and unexploded bombs after 30 years of daily bombing sorties. Peteris Elfers, a member of parliament, estimates that demining might take another 30 years. 'It has to be done,' he says, 'but we don't have the technology to do it well.' An inspection last summer found 364 bombs, mines and rockets after examining just the main bombing polygon of 159 ha - and only cursorily to a depth of 20 cm. Deadly waste understandably raises more eyebrows. In Sillamae, a closed military city on Estonia's north-eastern coast, a classified chemical combine has left a 20m-high dam that contains, according to Murray Feshbach, an expert on the Soviet environment at Georgetown University in the US, 4m tonnes of uranium ore, 1,200 tonnes of pure uranium, 1,000 tonnes of radium, 800 tonnes of thorium, plus 2m tonnes of calcium sulphide oil shale ash and some ground radioactivity. In a big storm, this could go into the nearby Gulf of Finland and directly affect the Baltic rim countries. Feshbach says one safety measure, so far not carried out, would be to encase the dam in cement. Nuclear waste pockets have also been discovered across the Baltic hinterlands. Last summer in Lithuania, radioactive equipment dumped at a landfill in Zokniai, an airfield near Siulinae, produced alarming geiger readings. Paldiski, a big submarine base in Estonia, has two nuclear reactors, a depository for liquid waste, another for solid waste and underground pipelines for radioactive sewage. In troop withdrawal talks, Russia has agreed to give up the base, remove the nuclear fuel rods and take care of waste and the necessary clean-up. What should be done with the 600 tonnes of liquid waste and the two reactors is unclear. Estonia, which has a fiercely nationalistic government, worries about the proposed length of a Russian clean-up presence until 2000. It may look west for help instead, says Alar Olljum, a foreign ministry spokesman. But Feshbach worries more about dimethylhydrazine, also called heptyl, a liquid rocket fuel that is supertoxic, volatile, carcinogenic and nerve paralysing. Around 270 tonnes - of the estimated 150,000 tonnes in the former Soviet Union - have been found around Ventspils, a large Latvian port city. 'There is no known technology to get rid of it,' says Feshbach. 'The cheapest way is to fire it from rockets.' However, Harry Whitacker, chief of emergency engineering at Environment Canada, hopes heptyl can be turned into ammonia or methanol by using ultraviolet light and peroxide in an advanced oxidation process; and nitric acid, once pumped to the surface, could be converted to fertiliser if mixed with ammonium and hydroxide. On the Baltic Sea shore, military harbours have been left in a pitiable state. At Liepaja, a top Soviet Baltic Fleet base, the harbour floor, polluted by heavy metals and crude oil a metre deep, needs to be dredged. Just off the coast sit sunken battleship hulls, stripped of non-ferrous iron. Nearby are submarines which used batteries leaving semi-toxic residue  -potentially dangerous if built up over time. Clean-up would be expensive, but a World Bank official says the spectacular site of pilfered Soviet warships might be a profitable tourist site. The bank has made the conversion of Liepaja from a military into a commercial centre a priority project in the belief that the city's large port could be a key trans-shipment point to and from the Russian market. The bank has obtained the Latvian government's commitment to support a project of water treatment, coastal management and tourism. Environment Canada would handle the military pollution. Like any economically depressed nation, however, Latvia must make hard choices on pollution clean-up. A clear economic incentive is needed to secure funding. Symbolic cost estimates have been presented to Russia, the inheritor of the Soviet army. Latvia has sent Moscow a Dollars 147m (Pounds 99m) bill for land use and anticipated clean-up. Realistically, however, the Balts do not expect Russia to pay.   Countries:-  EEZ  Estonia, East Europe.     LVZ  Latvia, East Europe.     LTZ  Lithuania, East Europe.

[passage omitted]    Answering a question about the relationship between Hamas  and  the alliance of the 10 factions, Abu-Marzuq said: We have a  good relationship despite recent reports casting doubt on this  relationship, which will remain pivotal for us.    Abu-Marzuq further stressed that Hamas seeks to develop this  relationship so the alliance can undertake its important jihad  role to defeat the Oslo and Cairo accords, as an indispensable  step before resuming the plan of liberation.    Abu-Marzuq, who had just heard about the unjust Zionist  bombing of the [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]  General Command positions in al-Na'imah, expressed his sympathy  and solidarity with the heroes of the General Command, saying:  We complement each other in the same trench and course.  [passage omitted]    On the fate of the 10 factions that oppose the settlement if  a Syrian-Israeli agreement is reached, Abu-Marzuq said he rules  out the possibility of such agreement in the short run,  considering the solid Syrian position. He stressed, however,  that the major organizational body of Hamas is inside the  occupied territories. Therefore, it remains free from influence  by any Palestinian or Arab agreements.    Commenting on the entry of the Palestinian police force into  Gaza and Jericho, Abu-Marzuq said: These forces are from the  sons of the Palestinian people and some of them fought heroic  battles for liberation. Therefore, we will welcome their  presence among the people there as long as they are protecting  the people's security. This position will change if these forces  change their attitude and turn into political forces to suppress  strugglers and opponents from various national and Islamic  political currents and persuasions.
